    "'Raw' data is considered to be data that is objectively gathered from the field and placed into the data set without any additional context or consideration. But this is not possible given that the data is the product of unequal social situations. It cannot be objective. It comes with bias of the context the individual is in. Using past experience to predict the future creates a reinforcement loop.\n",

    "Data and the corresponding analysis is produced in context – 'by specific people in specific cicumstances – cultural, historical, and geographic.' The goal is to bring together multiple, 'partial' perspectives. 'Lived experience' is a good reference to how your contribution can be valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be framed as 'persectives,' 'standpoints,' and/or 'positionalities.' Revealing one's positionality in the framing of the work presented is considered a positive contribution to the 'objectivity' of the project by revealing that there are necessary limitations to such objectivity given the source of the information.\n",
