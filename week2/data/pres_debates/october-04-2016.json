{"content": [{"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Good evening. From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Im Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News. Its an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence. Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines. The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then Ill ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, its been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question. Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight. Id like to start with the topic of presidential leadership. Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. Im proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. Thats why Im so proud to be her running mate. Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. Itll be whether we can make somebodys life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer  its going to be about results. And she said to me, youve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. Youve been a city councilman and mayor. Youve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in peoples lives. And thats what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clintons right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. Im so proud of her. Ill just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life. We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Governor Pence?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to  thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates. Its deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my  my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, its an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just  I also want to say  I want to say thanks to everyone thats looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, weve seen Americas place in the world weakened. Weve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being  being with us tonight. I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, Im a  Im a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my sons age. My mom and dad built a  everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and  and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I  honestly, Elaine, I never imagined  never imagined Id have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I  I would hope that if  if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that Im going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And thats to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where Ive served in the Congress of the United States, where  where Ive led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I  I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that  that lifetime of experience."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clintons character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters dont think shes trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Heres what people should look at as they look at a public servant. Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Childrens Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, its always been about putting others first. And thats a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, off the backs of the little guy. And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasnt born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I cant imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult-driven selfish me first style of Donald Trump."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, thoughtful, compassionate, and steady. Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president. Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, let me  let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign. It really is remarkable. At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clintons tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administrations foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. I mean, the situation were watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create. The newly emboldened  the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now their heavy-handed approach"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "You guys love Russia. You both have said"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": " their heavy-handed approach."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "You both have said  you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well[crosstalk]"}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Well, were going to get to Russia in just a moment.

But in the meantime, the questions"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, Senator, I must have hit a[crosstalk]I must have hit a nerve here."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Why the disconnect?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where weve weakened Americas place in the world, stifled Americas economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults. Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. Hes brought an extraordinary business acumen. Hes employed tens of thousands of people in this country."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "[crosstalk]"}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "And why the disconnect with your running mate?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "But theres a  theres a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. And thats because theyre paying attention. I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on. She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "You are Donald Trumps apprentice. Let me talk about this[crosstalk]"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Senator, I think Im still on my time."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Well, I think  isnt this a discussion?"}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "This is our open discussion."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Yeah, lets talk about the state of[crosstalk]"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, let me interrupt  let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Finish your sentence."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "OK, now I can weigh in.

When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, do you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Yes."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan? Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile? Under Secretary Clintons leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth. She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile. She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Absolutely, without firing a shot. And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Right and"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "These are very, very good things."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Hillary Clinton  Hillary Clinton  Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "No, that is incorrect.

And, Elaine, Iraq didnt want our troops to stay, and they wouldnt give us the protection for our troops. And guess what? If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, were not going to stay without their protection."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "It was a failure of the secretary of state"}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, thats"}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy. Lets turn to the issue of the economy."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "OK."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "I think the fact that  that under this past administration of which Hillary Clinton was a part, weve almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. I mean, Im very proud of the fact that  I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, weve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. Thats a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually  he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, weve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. But I think hes a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals thatll put the American worker first, and youve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, thats when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trumps plan will do, then were going to have the resources to meet our nations needs at home and abroad, and were going to have the ability to bring down the national debt."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Senator Kaine?"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Elaine, on the economy, theres a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a youre hired president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a youre fired president in Donald Trump? I think thats not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan thats on the table thats a youre hired plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you cant work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as weve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top whove benefited as weve come out of recession to pay more. The Trump plan is a different plan. Its a youre fired plan. And theres two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is thats exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession  the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump  why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trumps 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years. Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. Does that seem fair to you?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the youre hired, youre fired thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Fifteen million new jobs?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": " slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Fifteen million new jobs?"}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Governor[crosstalk]"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "And the poverty level and the median income"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": " stepped into the Oval Office."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": " improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "You  honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "But its not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Its not more spending[crosstalk]"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "I am interested to hear whether hell defend his running mates not releasing taxes and not paying taxes."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Absolutely I will."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine  God bless you for it, career public servants, thats great  Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business. Those tax returns that were  that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used whats called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "But why wont he release his tax returns?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, were answering the question about  about a business thing, is he"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "I do want to come back to that, but"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "His tax returns  his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way its supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "How do you know that? You havent seen his tax returns."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "He created a runway  because hes created a business thats worth billions of dollars today."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "How do you know that?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didnt pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs.

And the last thing Ill say is this"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Senator, do you take all the deductions that youre entitled to?"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "The last thing  the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "I do."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president.

What would your administration do to prevent this cut?"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "First, were going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done. It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty. And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty. We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And well look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that. Heres what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us. And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. Were going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security.

Law enforcement and race relations. After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, Were asking cops to do too much in this country. Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, lets give it to the cops."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Elaine, I think thats a very fair comment. I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Heres what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, its safer for the communities and its safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that dont work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So heres what well do. Well focus on community policing. We will focus on  and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. Im a gun-owner. Im a strong Second Amendment supporter. But Ive got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so were going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we wont have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldnt survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Governor Pence?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago.

Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. Its worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that.

But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, theres only one candidate who can do it, and its Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. Thats seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And shes got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Heres her plan to defeat ISIL. First, weve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and shell lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, weve got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. Thats the Hillary Clinton plan; shes got the experience to do it. Donald Trump. Donald Trump cant start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesnt have a plan. He said, I have a secret plan, and then he said, Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL. And then he said, Im going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan. And finally he said, Im going to fire all the generals. He doesnt have a plan. But he does have dangerous ideas. Heres four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCains no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances.

Its absolutely inarguable. Weve weakened Americas place in the world. Its been a combination of factors, but mostly its been a lack of leadership.

And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and its overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009. But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and Id always give her a hug and tell her were never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.

Hillary Clintons top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russian reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America  the greatest nation on Earth  just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins  look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. Weve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.

Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And its clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin. The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground.

You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea. Im on the Foreign Relations Committee. We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea. And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this  virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. Theyre starting to get worried about North Korea, too. So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions. So were working together with China, and we need to. Chinas another one of those relationships where its competitive, its also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate. Hillary understands that very well. She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, Womens rights are human rights. They didnt want her to say that, but she did. But shes also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China. And thats what its going to take.

My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I dont believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we dont raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. Im not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didnt feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives dont feel like we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Governor Pence?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, its a wonderful question.

And with my wife at my side, weve followed a calling into public service, where weve  weve tried to  weve tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.

The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. Im also very pleased at the fact were well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if youre going to be pro-life, you should  you should be pro-adoption. But what I cant understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view  and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally  but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me. And I cannot  I cant conscience about  about a party that supports that. Or that  I know youve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to  wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldnt use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant. But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else. So lets talk about abortion and choice. Lets talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. Thats something we trust American women to do that. And we dont think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion. Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who werent even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy. I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump-Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "No, its really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Then why did Donald Trump say that?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "We just never would."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Why did he say that?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, look, its  look, hes not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Well, I would admit thats not a polished[crosstalk]"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "You know, things dont always come out exactly the way he means them."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Well, can I say"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "But Im telling you what the policy of our administration would be."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Great line from the  great line from the gospel of Matthew. From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Yeah."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Im telling you"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": " or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Senator, youve whipped out that Mexican thing again. He  look"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Can you defend it?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "You want to  you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, Ill go there. But heres  there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldnt be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, whos standing for the right to life. Its a principle that  Senator Kaine  and Im very gentle about this, because I really do respect you  its a principle that you embrace."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "This is important"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": " bring the  lets welcome the children into our world. There are so many families around the country who cant have children. We could improve adoption"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "But, Governor"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": " so that families that cant have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies."}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Governor, why dont you trust women to make this choice for themselves? We can encourage people to support life. Of course we can. But why dont you trust women? Why doesnt Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Because there are"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": " but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Because there is  a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. I believe it with all my heart. And I couldnt be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "I do have one final question for you both tonight. It has been a divisive campaign. Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Thats a really important one. That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign. And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump  and this is  this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he cant defend Donald Trump  Donald Trump has run a campaign thats been about one insult after the next. But we do have to bring the country together. So heres what well do. Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state. And I served in the Senate. And Im really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton. She was on the Armed Services Committee. She was on other committees. She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana. She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon. She worked to get benefits for  TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard. She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen. And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record. I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses. And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle. Because I think its fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together. And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?"}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": "Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion"}, {"actor": "Kaine", "dialogue": "Absolutely."}, {"actor": "Pence", "dialogue": " tonight. Thank you, Senator. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened Americas place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C. You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but its going to take leadership to do it. The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback. And Donald Trumps entire career has been about building. Its been about  its going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and  when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, were going to have a stronger America. When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. Theyre going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and well have the kind of unity thats been missing for way too long."}, {"actor": "Quijano", "dialogue": "All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.
