1
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:37,026


2
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,940
We have arrived at the Hong Kong International Airport.

3
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:10,858
Please take all your baggage with you.

4
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:13,025
We have arrived...

5
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:14,148
You're back!

6
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,108
Daddy.

7
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:16,733
Miss me?

8
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:17,315
One…

9
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:17,773
Two…

10
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:18,483
Three…

11
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:19,608
Yeah!

12
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,275
Leave at once!

13
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:28,106
Due to an emergency at the airport,

14
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,900
passengers please leave the airport immediately.

15
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,358
Be careful! Go!

16
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:39,525
This way!

17
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:43,567
Due to an emergency situation,

18
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:47,275
passengers please leave the airport immediately.

19
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:45,106
Hong Kong International Airport,

20
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:48,190
sitting on 1,255 hectares and cost $70 billion to build,

21
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:50,567
was blown to bits in an instant,

22
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,233
killing thousands.

23
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,317
Why did that happen?

24
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:56,983
Anger.

25
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,900
Anger can destroy everything.

26
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,733
Luckily when all hope was lost,

27
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,942
one man

28
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,317
overcame his anger

29
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,025
and stopped this tragedy from happening.

30
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,358
Help!

31
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:22,565
It'll blow.

32
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:23,775
Help!

33
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:25,067
One hour ago,

34
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,440
a man armed with a grenade robbed a watch shop.

35
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:28,317
This is a stickup!

36
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:29,400
This is a grenade!

37
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,358
Put the watches in the bag.

38
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,025
Hurry!

39
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:33,692
Put out your hand!

40
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:34,608
Hold this!

41
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,067
Tightly!

42
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,400
Don't let go!

43
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:38,483
Or it'll blow.

44
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:40,483
It'll blow up! Help!

45
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,233
Help!

46
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,483
- Help me! - Stay where you are.

47
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:45,942
Stand still.

48
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,608
Don't be afraid.

49
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,775
The hole of the grenade is displaced.

50
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,858
Can't put the pin back in.

51
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,400
The only solution

52
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,150
is to detonate it on the spot.

53
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,733
Extend the lockdown area to 40m.

54
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,106
Yes, Sir! Calling command post!

55
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:25,106
Find an open area and start piling up sandbags.

56
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,442
Yes, Sir! Get the sandbags.

57
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:34,775
It'll be over soon.

58
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:37,940
Fung!

59
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,275
The sandbags are ready.

60
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,400
Let's begin!

61
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,108
No!

62
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:48,108
It'll blow.

63
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,356
No! No!

64
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:50,358
No!

65
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,817
It'll blow up!

66
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:53,648
No!

67
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,858
OK! OK!

68
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:57,108
Calm down! You'll be fine.

69
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,900
Fung! What are you doing?

70
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,150
You took off the suit?

71
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,233
Don't worry!

72
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,525
Here we go.

73
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:18,692
OK!

74
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,192
OK!

75
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,983
Give it to me…

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,317
Easy… No rush!

77
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:33,233
OK!

78
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,108
OK!

79
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:47,817
Very good!

80
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,150
Why did you take off the suit?

81
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:17,356
The girl was so scared. I couldn't do anything.

82
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:17,856
Here…

83
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:20,192
Covering her with the bomb suit can ensure safety?

84
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,733
If the grenade went off,

85
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:22,775
what will happen to you?

86
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,108
You'll both fry!

87
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,108
Hey!

88
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,567
You don't save lives by risking your own.

89
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:32,275
You're right. Saving lives doesn't mean risking my own.

90
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:33,731
But as an EODB (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau) officer,

91
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,315
when do we not risk our lives?

92
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:36,442
You're right.

93
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,900
There's no need to spell it out.

94
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,190
Tung Sir has a point.

95
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:40,898
Because he's Tung Sir!

96
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,733
You're taking his side?

97
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,733
Over here! Hurry!

98
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,067
Over here! Over here!

99
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:57,773
- Police! - What's is it?

100
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:58,483
What's going on?

101
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,233
Somebody threw corrosive liquid off the building.

102
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:01,650
We wish to come in for a look.

103
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,025
Police!

104
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,025
Open up!

105
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:18,775
Get down!

106
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,192
Get down!

107
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,317
"Dad : Mom has terminal cancer."

108
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:39,817
"Dad : Mom has terminal cancer."

109
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,648
What's going on?

110
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,815
We got a call,

111
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,692
someone threw corrosive liquid off the building.

112
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,733
We went door to door, someone on 7/F refused to open up.

113
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:59,106
We broke the door down,

114
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:01,567
and found the owner hold his ex-girlfriend and her husband hostage

115
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,692
and tied them to two bombs.

116
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,233
Stay calm, Miss! Sit tight and don't move.

117
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,025
We'll get you out ASAP.

118
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:02,023
The bombs are identical.

119
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,483
Should be the same design.

120
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:13,608
Detonated by pressure.

121
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:16,233
When she stands up,

122
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,108
the bomb will go off.

123
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,483
Luckily we caught this in time.

124
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,358
We're finished if she gets tired.

125
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:23,858
Are these wires

126
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:25,608
connected to the bomb on your end?

127
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,150
Bingo!

128
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,400
They're synchronized.

129
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:30,567
If one goes off,

130
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,900
the other one will too.

131
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:33,192
If we defuse one bomb,

132
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:34,942
the other will also go off.

133
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:36,481
The wiring is of a basic design.

134
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:37,775
If we cut the power,

135
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:39,275
the bomb won't go off.

136
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,483
It's black powder.

137
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,817
100 grams in each pipe…

138
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:55,856
that's 300 grams total.

139
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,731
Based on Sadovsky's formula,

140
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,565
the brisance is that of 3 grenades, the bomb suit will hold.

141
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,192
Man,

142
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:02,648
let's get them out first.

143
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,150
OK!

144
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,315
Miss, please stay calm.

145
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:09,983
I'll now cut the chain for you.

146
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,067
After that, go out this door,

147
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,358
someone will help you.

148
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,983
We're ready to cut the chain.

149
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:32,525
Copy!

150
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,858
Copy!

151
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:37,358
Ready?

152
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:38,067
Ready!

153
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:50,983
Don't be afraid. Go out now.

154
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:51,900
Come.

155
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,150
Cut the green wire.

156
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,400
In sync.

157
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,275
The timing…

158
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:57,817
no more than 1/4 second apart.

159
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,692
Copy.

160
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,275
Give me a beat.

161
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,608
Fine!

162
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:02,900
On 420.

163
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:03,650
Ready.

164
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,400
To! We're ready to roll.

165
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:06,108
Copy!

166
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,023
4-0-3-4-2

167
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,150
4-0-3-4-2

168
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,650
4-3-4-2-4-3

169
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:11,692
4-3-4-2-0

170
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:55,150
OK!

171
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:58,775
All clear!

172
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:05,108
You can go. I'll wrap up.

173
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,525
Thanks!

174
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:25,858
Watch out!

175
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:47,606
Officer down! Send in the paramedic!

176
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:48,317
Tung Sir!

177
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:49,067
Go check on Fung!

178
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:50,108
Yes, Sir!

179
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:24,858
What?

180
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:28,231
I lost a leg, but I still have two hands.

181
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,606
I can defuse a bomb with my left hand

182
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:30,525
and hold your hand

183
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,400
with my right.

184
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,525
I may be the only coolest

185
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,358
handicapped EODB officer.

186
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,733
Tell the boys, I'll be back soon.

187
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,692
Fung said he'll be back soon!

188
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:48,692
Hey! Talk to me!

189
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,942
I'll be back soon.

190
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,358
"Gabapentin Capsules for epilepsy/neuropathic pain"

191
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:31,358
Madam, something for you.

192
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:36,981
What?

193
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,150
I love you!

194
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:50,108
800 m

195
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:51,525
in 2 minutes and 21 seconds.

196
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:52,942
Take a break.

197
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,233
I'm not tired.

198
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:57,231
You beat the Police standard,

199
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,650
you should take a break.

200
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,692
A toast to me, I can walk again.

201
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,523
And to you, for your promotion.

202
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:08,608
So you have heard?

203
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,648
The boys said we should celebrate with you.

204
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,858
Sure thing!

205
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:14,190
I knew you can do it.

206
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,398
I was afraid you'd get ahead of me and now you did it.

207
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,108
Cut the crap!

208
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,358
I wonder when I can go back to work.

209
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,150
If I don't start working soon,

210
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:23,733
I think I'll go crazy. Seriously…

211
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,481
The brass said as soon as you're ready,

212
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:26,690
they'll have a desk job for you.

213
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:27,442
A desk job?

214
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:28,567
A desk job.

215
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,525
Are you kidding me?

216
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:31,983
But…

217
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:33,856
I'd think the same if I were in their shoes.

218
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:35,692
They don't know how fit I am.

219
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:37,275
Arrange for the fitness test ASAP.

220
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,440
Once they see the results,

221
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,317
they'll be begging me to come back to work.

222
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:42,233
Come back!

223
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:44,192
Please come back!

224
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,315
Like that?

225
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,275
Yes!

226
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:09,608
8!

227
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,317
Here we go.

228
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,942
29!

229
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:16,981
29 minus 8…

230
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:17,898
Very good!

231
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,233
Even higher than Police standard!

232
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,525
Sir, can I help you?

233
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:31,733
The bombing at the Education Bureau is an isolated incident.

234
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:35,275
There's no specific intel suggesting Hong Kong

235
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,565
is a likely target of terrorist attack.

236
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:40,233
The city's threat of terrorist attack

237
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:42,400
is currently assessed to be moderate.

238
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,440
The suicide bomber at the Education Bureau was a terrorist,

239
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:47,442
called Cheung Chi Man.

240
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,025
He was a grad student working on his PhD.

241
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,025
6 months ago,

242
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,900
his girlfriend, who was also a grad student jumped off a building.

243
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:07,731
Inside the computer in his flat,

244
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,856
we found a downloaded file from the dark web

245
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:11,440
about a new extremist group called Vendetta

246
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,608
and its "The Guide to Lone-wolf Terrorism".

247
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,733
In the past,

248
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:17,400
Vendetta used the social networking platform of the dark web

249
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:20,067
to provide assistance to those who detest society

250
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,983
and engineer lone-wolf terrorist attacks overseas.

251
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,900
Our intel shows

252
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,525
two people are the masterminds behind the group.

253
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,650
One uses the codename Maverick,

254
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:47,940
Ma Sai Kwan,

255
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,440
a rich 2G from Hong Kong.

256
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:52,231
When he was at University College London studying Economics and Political Science,

257
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,106
he was already an anarchist.

258
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:57,858
In 1997, he was in Seattle for the anti-WTO protests.

259
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,733
In 2000, he took over the family business.

260
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,898
A year later, along with several foreigners,

261
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,275
he trashed up an international fast food chain.

262
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:07,067
Get out of the place!

263
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:10,065
Mr. Ma, about what you're doing, will your family be disappointed?

264
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,356
They have no right to be disappointed.

265
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:12,525
My family

266
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,775
made their fortune

267
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:15,648
from the Brits

268
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,775
selling opium.

269
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,273
Their money was dirty.

270
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:21,440
When he was out on bail, he jumped bail

271
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:23,940
and illegally transferred

272
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:26,567
USD$300M from his family's account to an offshore bank.

273
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:27,690
He once said

274
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:29,565
his family fortune was sinful.

275
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,483
He wanted to use justice to clean it up.

276
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,400
5 years ago,

277
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:34,900
he used a fake passport and returned to Hong Kong.

278
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:36,856
After that, he vanished without a trace.

279
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:37,692
Our intel shows

280
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:38,983
in his external communications,

281
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,275
he often mentioned someone called Davy.

282
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,442
INTERPOL believes

283
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:45,025
Davy is another mastermind behind Vendetta.

284
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:47,483
But we have yet to confirm his real identity.

285
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:48,692
Over the past 4 months,

286
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:52,108
they have arranged for at least 30 armed personnel to sneak into Hong Kong.

287
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:54,900
It appears they're using Hong Kong to launch a terrorist attack.

288
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,150
I'm now putting you in charge

289
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,983
of tracking them down.

290
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,233
Find Ma Sai Kwan and Davy ASAP.

291
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:01,775
To prevent any leaks,

292
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:03,858
this operation is classified.

293
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:04,775
Understand?

294
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:23,233
"Gabapentin Capsules for epilepsy/neuropathic pain"

295
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,025
Sir,

296
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:32,442
meds

297
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,067
should be taken with water.

298
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:11,981
Look at that!

299
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:13,773
Sorry, I'll pay you $5,000.

300
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:14,523
Where did you learn how to drive?

301
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:15,398
How about $10K?

302
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,440
Money isn't everything.

303
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,150
Of course not.

304
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:18,523
I just want to pay you. Sorry! Is this OK?

305
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:19,356
Do you have a license?

306
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,148
Of course!

307
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,315
- Officer! Sorry! - Well?

308
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,940
- Can you settle this? - We're trying.

309
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:24,565
- You wanna pursue this? - Of course!

310
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,067
I'll pay for it.

311
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:28,400
I'll jot down the damages of both vehicles.

312
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:29,692
I need you to stand...

313
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,025
Are you new here?

314
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:13,858
Yes!

315
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:17,525
I want a staff...

316
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:25,692
Lock down elevator No. 4.

317
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:26,025
Copy!

318
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,650
Fighting in elevator No. 4.

319
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:41,775
It's now locked on 5/F,

320
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:42,856
send someone over right away.

321
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:43,900
We reached the elevator.

322
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:06,817
He jumped onto elevator No. 5

323
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:10,690
and got off on 10/F.

324
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:11,817
Go check it out!

325
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,983
Stay where you are!

326
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:14,775
Hey!

327
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:29,690
So noisy!

328
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:30,483
What's going on?

329
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,192
What's going on?

330
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,483
Open the door!

331
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:40,233
The lighting ceremony of Glimmering Hong Kong is about to commence.

332
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:43,317
Let's have the Chairman of the Real Estate Developers Association,

333
00:25:43,358 --> 00:25:44,481
Mr. Leung Chi Choi

334
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:46,567
to come up here for the lighting ceremony.

335
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:47,650
Key! Key!

336
00:25:47,692 --> 00:25:48,442
Open the door!

337
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:52,608
Don't move!

338
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,190
Check the hotel carefully.

339
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:44,983
Look for any suspicious looking or potential explosives.

340
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:46,067
Yes, Sir!

341
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:47,358
Tung Sir, what kind was it?

342
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,775
We think it was C-4.

343
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,565
C-4?

344
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,233
Madam,

345
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,108
a victim was in hotel uniform,

346
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:53,108
but the hotel has nothing on him.

347
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,192
He's probably a suspect.

348
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:54,983
Over there!

349
00:26:58,608 --> 00:26:59,275
Fung!

350
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:01,481
One…

351
00:27:01,483 --> 00:27:01,773
Two…

352
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:02,148
Three…

353
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:02,900
Up!

354
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:10,190
More casualties are on the way. Everyone, standby!

355
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:10,731
Yes!

356
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:11,981
In the Island Hotel explosion,

357
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:14,442
the death toll has increased to 18.

358
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,023
According to a reliable source,

359
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:18,317
the Police investigation is skewed towards a terrorist attack.

360
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,608
For security reasons, several major events have been canceled.

361
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:53,773
Three…

362
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:54,231
Two…

363
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:54,733
One…

364
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:58,067
Again!

365
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:58,650
Three…

366
00:27:58,817 --> 00:27:59,317
Two…

367
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,900
One…

368
00:28:10,358 --> 00:28:12,273
The bomb had a primer for military use

369
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,900
with an instantaneous detonator.

370
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,400
Probably the on/off switch of the lighting ceremony.

371
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:19,315
Unlike the Education Bureau explosion 4 months ago,

372
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:20,648
RDX, cyclonite was used.

373
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,731
This time, C-4.

374
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,067
They're both high performance explosives.

375
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,442
The suspect in the custodial ward, any updates?

376
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:27,733
He's still in a coma.

377
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:29,400
We cross-matched his fingerprints

378
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:32,190
and confirmed he's ex-EODB officer,

379
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:33,192
Poon Shing Fung.

380
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:37,523
The CCTV showed him coming out with the on/off switch.

381
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:38,690
He also got in a fight with a security guard.

382
00:28:38,692 --> 00:28:40,525
Don't get ahead of ourselves

383
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:42,525
in drawing conclusions.

384
00:29:00,983 --> 00:29:02,150
"Poon Shing Fung is awake"

385
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:03,650
Chan Sir,

386
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,067
Poon Shing Fung is awake.

387
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,942
Tung Sir,

388
00:29:07,983 --> 00:29:10,275
Poon Shing Fung was your ex-partner.

389
00:29:10,942 --> 00:29:12,067
Madam Pong,

390
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
he was your old friend.

391
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,442
You should both stay away.

392
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:17,856
That's why Lee Sir will follow up with Poon Shing Fung.

393
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:18,483
Yes, Sir!

394
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:20,733
Before we have any leads to go on,

395
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:22,275
not a word to anyone

396
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:24,067
about Poon Shing Fung.

397
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:25,567
Yes, Sir!

398
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,483
"Ming Sum Hospital"

399
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:30,192
Long time no see.

400
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,692
Do I know you?

401
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:40,400
Fine!

402
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,233
I'm CIP (Chief Inspector of Police) of the Crime Unit Lee Yiu Sing.

403
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:45,942
You are not obliged to say anything

404
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,692
unless you wish to do so,

405
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,233
but whatever you say

406
00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:50,856
will be taken down in writing

407
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:52,190
and may be given as evidence in Court.

408
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,275
I want some water.

409
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,942
Hey!

410
00:29:59,317 --> 00:30:00,150
Poon Shing Fung,

411
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:02,442
you're a suspect in an explosion.

412
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:04,733
In 2019, on October 3,

413
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,275
what were you doing

414
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:07,567
at Island Hotel?

415
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,567
I want some water.

416
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,606
I'm asking you about Island Hotel...

417
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:15,150
I don't remember.

418
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,692
With other suspects, I'm never this patient.

419
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,650
Poon Shing Fung,

420
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:23,192
what were you doing there?

421
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,650
Do you have accomplices?

422
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:26,983
Poon Shing Fung?

423
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,442
I don't even remember my name.

424
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:32,442
Can you tell me what I am doing here?

425
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:33,192
Sure!

426
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:34,442
Let me jog your memory.

427
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:37,983
You blew 18 people to bits and dozens more are injured.

428
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:39,817
If you refuse to work with the Police,

429
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,481
prison is where you'll spend the rest of your life.

430
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:43,442
No way!

431
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,108
I had nothing to do with it.

432
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:46,692
It wasn't me.

433
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:49,190
Also, Wong Lai Ling, the cleaning lady.

434
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:50,900
It was her last day, she was retiring.

435
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:52,650
You blew her up.

436
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:53,358
Look again!

437
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,190
Get away from me!

438
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:54,900
Start talking!

439
00:30:54,942 --> 00:30:55,440
What are you doing?

440
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:56,650
- Speak up! - Lee Sir!

441
00:31:09,608 --> 00:31:11,733
The patient had a major concussion

442
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:13,565
that resulted in PTA (Post-Traumatic Amnesia).

443
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,231
He had no idea how he ended up here.

444
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:16,481
Can't even remember his own name.

445
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:17,567
Can he fake it?

446
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:19,692
He may be able to fool you,

447
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:21,148
but not this machine.

448
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,398
The temporal lobe consists of hippocampus

449
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,356
responsible for short term and long term memory.

450
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:28,192
The fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) shows the inner temporal lobe is inactive,

451
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:30,150
which means he lacks memory activities.

452
00:31:30,483 --> 00:31:32,108
Obviously, he suffered an injury.

453
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,233
Will he recover?

454
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:35,900
It's hard to say.

455
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,358
Some have a speedy recovery.

456
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,358
For others, external factors may lead to a gradual recovery.

457
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,856
But for some, they may never recover.

458
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:45,775
Damage to the hippocampus only affects declarative memory.

459
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:47,525
For example, he won't remember where he has been,

460
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:48,608
what he has done

461
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:50,983
or won't recall people he knows.

462
00:31:57,692 --> 00:32:00,275
But for things he's accustomed to, his motor skills,

463
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:01,690
such as brushing his teeth,

464
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:02,815
driving a car or using a computer;

465
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:04,733
what we consider procedural memory,

466
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,567
won't be affected.

467
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:08,731
Because this type of memory is deeply embedded

468
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,481
in our subconscious as implicit memory,

469
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,233
and won't need our consciousness to recall.

470
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:14,023
Someone who suffers from declarative memory loss,

471
00:32:14,025 --> 00:32:15,650
may form a new consciousness,

472
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:18,817
exhibit a new temperament, develop new concepts

473
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:20,898
or even form a new outlook on right and wrong.

474
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,025
In other words, become a different person.

475
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:37,108
Sir,

476
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:38,858
I have an idea.

477
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,067
Salute!

478
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,065
Place your men in deadly peril and they will survive.

479
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,817
Leave them in dire straits and they're reborn.

480
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:08,858
Boss!

481
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,067
My troops.

482
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,900
They're willing to die for you.

483
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,067
Boys,

484
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:14,273
are you ready?

485
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:15,400
Yes, sir!

486
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,275
Good!

487
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:17,983
Let's wait for Davy,

488
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:20,567
and Resurrection Day may proceed as planned.

489
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:22,067
How is Blizzard?

490
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,067
Still in the hospital.

491
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:27,817
Resurrection day

492
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:29,565
cannot happen without Blizzard.

493
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:30,358
Yes! Boss!

494
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,483
"Ming Sum Hospital"

495
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,650
We're taking you to do a MRI scan.

496
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:58,275
Please remove all metals on him.

497
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,692
Don't move!

498
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:25,817
Be quiet! Don't move!

499
00:35:29,817 --> 00:35:31,608
Lee Sir, Poon Shing Fung is doing a MRI scan.

500
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,233
Out to all, the prisoner escaped from the MRI room.

501
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:45,317
You in the wheelchair, don't move!

502
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:58,192
Sit tight! We'll break you out!

503
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:17,067
Police!

504
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:17,775
Freeze!

505
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:33,067
Police!

506
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:41,400
Come back!

507
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:46,565
Due to an emergency at the hospital…

508
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:47,398
Follow me!

509
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,108
…please follow instructions from hospital personnel and evacuate at once.

510
00:36:52,108 --> 00:36:53,192
Hurry! It's not safe here.

511
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:44,275
Follow me.

512
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:45,275
Get down.

513
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,942
Out to all, suspect is in Prosthetic and Orthotic Unit on 2/F.

514
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:09,442
Stay back!

515
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:10,358
What is it?

516
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,025
Don't move!

517
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:12,065
Stay where you are!

518
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:13,067
Get back! Get back!

519
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:14,858
Poon Shing Fung,

520
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:15,983
let the driver go.

521
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:17,442
You framed me for killing 18 people.

522
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:18,608
I don't mind adding one more.

523
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,400
Drop your weapon!

524
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:20,817
Don't push me!

525
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,942
Take it easy!

526
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:22,650
Stay where you are!

527
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:23,775
Drive!

528
00:38:26,692 --> 00:38:27,317
Poon Shing Fung,

529
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:28,567
come back!

530
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,150
Stop the car!

531
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:29,775
Now!

532
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:30,942
Relax!

533
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:31,900
Just drive!

534
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,608
I will catch you.

535
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,567
Definitely!

536
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:57,775
Madam, the vehicle is over there.

537
00:38:57,817 --> 00:38:59,692
He's the owner. We confirmed it's his car.

538
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:01,483
How much longer will it take?

539
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:03,233
I need to work.

540
00:39:06,983 --> 00:39:08,025
That's my wallet.

541
00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:17,817
Thank you!

542
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:07,775
Madam!

543
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:09,690
RoadCams spotted Poon Shing Fung in Mongkok.

544
00:40:09,692 --> 00:40:11,233
He went inside a cybercafe.

545
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:27,400
"Siu Ming"

546
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,358
Poon Shing Fung?

547
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:46,525
"Poon Shing Fung"

548
00:40:48,317 --> 00:40:49,650
"Poon Shing Fung"

549
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,483
"EODB officer lost one leg in IED (Improvised Explosive Device) explosion"

550
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:32,108
"EODB officer defuses 2,000-pound wartime bomb after 20 hours"

551
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:37,608
"Cell phone radio wave or interference may increase risk of explosion"

552
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,317
Hang in there!

553
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,315
Seal off the back and guard all the intersections.

554
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:56,817
Yes, Sir!

555
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,025
Poon Shing Fung!

556
00:42:12,192 --> 00:42:12,942
We located the suspect.

557
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:14,150
He escaped through the back door.

558
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:16,192
He's in a navy jacket and grey jeans.

559
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:16,775
Copy!

560
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:19,608
Poon Shing Fung!

561
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:22,150
Stop!

562
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:23,692
Stay where you are!

563
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:26,108
Come back!

564
00:42:26,817 --> 00:42:27,817
Guard the back door!

565
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:28,733
Let's go up!

566
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:43,067
Poon Shing Fung!

567
00:42:43,317 --> 00:42:44,690
What is it? What are you doing?

568
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:45,775
Move! Police!

569
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,233
Poon Shing Fung!

570
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:01,817
Up there!

571
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:10,817
Poon Shing Fung!

572
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,483
Suspect on Fa Yuen Street!

573
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:28,400
Fa Yuen Street!

574
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:35,525
Stop!

575
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:47,190
Stop.

576
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:50,608
Suspect entered the back alley in between no. 46 and no. 48 on Fa Yuen Street!

577
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:15,942
He turned onto Tung Choi Street.

578
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,442
After him! Step aside!

579
00:44:22,983 --> 00:44:24,650
Lock down all exits on Tung Choi Street.

580
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:33,025
Move! Step aside…

581
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:34,275
Police!

582
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:35,692
Please step aside!

583
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,567
Step aside!

584
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:37,275
Move it!

585
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:38,900
Step aside!

586
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:40,067
Police!

587
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,900
Police!

588
00:44:40,942 --> 00:44:42,358
Step aside!

589
00:44:42,858 --> 00:44:44,192
- Step aside! - Police!

590
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:45,400
Move!

591
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:46,567
This way!

592
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:47,608
Step aside!

593
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,481
Sorry! Police!

594
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:49,067
Move aside!

595
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:50,192
Hey!

596
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:51,192
Freeze!

597
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:53,233
Step aside!

598
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,108
Suspect in Kam Wong Plaza.

599
00:44:58,775 --> 00:44:59,525
Poon Shing Fung!

600
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:01,442
Poon Shing Fung!

601
00:45:01,483 --> 00:45:02,233
Don't move!

602
00:45:04,442 --> 00:45:05,067
Get out!

603
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:06,400
Get out!

604
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:07,692
Go!

605
00:45:10,317 --> 00:45:11,067
Get out!

606
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,067
Everybody out!

607
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:13,567
This way!

608
00:45:15,775 --> 00:45:16,275
Move in!

609
00:45:23,983 --> 00:45:25,067
Go!

610
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,525
Stop!

611
00:45:34,025 --> 00:45:34,567
Don't move!

612
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,900
You called me.

613
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,608
You called me.

614
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:50,525
It's me.

615
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,525
I'm calling you.

616
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:08,692
"Dialing…5696 0142"

617
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:10,525
You still remember my number.

618
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:19,608
Tell me…

619
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,150
Can you carry on your mission?

620
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:32,150
Why didn't you pick up?

621
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:34,275
I don't take unknown calls.

622
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,815
Seal off Sai Yeung Choi Street and the nearby area. Keep looking.

623
00:46:36,817 --> 00:46:37,525
Copy.

624
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:39,400
They'll be here soon.

625
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:40,692
Go south on Nathan Road.

626
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,942
I'll contact you.

627
00:46:47,692 --> 00:46:49,358
Suspect is northbound on Nathan Road.

628
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:50,150
Copy.

629
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:56,275
You're Pong Ling.

630
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,650
Drive!

631
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,150
What are you doing?

632
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:09,358
You're a suspect in an explosion.

633
00:48:10,108 --> 00:48:11,317
Turn yourself in!

634
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:12,858
I don't remember anything.

635
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:14,942
I have nothing to say.

636
00:48:14,983 --> 00:48:15,858
Turn yourself in or I'll have you arrested.

637
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,817
Go ahead!

638
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,608
Don't push me!

639
00:48:18,942 --> 00:48:20,733
I'll kill you if I had no choice.

640
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:22,317
Drive!

641
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:28,108
Traffic 34, over!

642
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,442
Please check a stolen car.

643
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,775
I know we used to be friends.

644
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,275
Tell me…who am I?

645
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,775
I know different versions of you.

646
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:52,817
We used to go through Hell and back together.

647
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:54,900
You were an EODB officer who saved lives.

648
00:48:55,608 --> 00:48:57,525
After that, you became so full of yourself,

649
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:58,817
you drove yourself into a dead end.

650
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:01,775
The current you suffer from amnesia.

651
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:03,442
Which one do you want to know?

652
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:05,775
I lost my left leg in the line of duty?

653
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,317
Yes!

654
00:49:06,525 --> 00:49:07,733
In that explosion,

655
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:10,108
we both burnt our hands

656
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:12,400
and you lost your leg.

657
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:14,606
That's why EOD fired me?

658
00:49:14,608 --> 00:49:16,067
They did not.

659
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:19,608
We all know you don't want a desk job at EODB.

660
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:20,898
So we had a discussion

661
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,150
and decided to transfer you to PPRB (Police Public Relations Branch).

662
00:49:23,858 --> 00:49:24,733
Sorry, Sir!

663
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:28,525
I believe there's a misunderstanding.

664
00:49:28,983 --> 00:49:30,358
I'm an EODB officer,

665
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:32,525
I should be in the field.

666
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:35,442
All officers in the field must pass a strict physical.

667
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:37,148
I have more than passed it.

668
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,023
Tung Sir of EOD is waiting outside.

669
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:40,023
He can attest to that.

670
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:41,400
That won't be necessary.

671
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,150
I hope you'll understand,

672
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:45,192
if any future incident

673
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,940
is caused by the Police employing disabled personnel,

674
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:49,650
we'll have a lot of explaining to do.

675
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:51,650
You still doubt my ability.

676
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:53,608
I'm willing to undertake any fitness test.

677
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,108
If I don't pass,

678
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:56,981
so be it.

679
00:49:56,983 --> 00:49:58,858
That really won't be necessary.

680
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:01,150
Don't waste anyone's time.

681
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:02,400
I hope you'll understand.

682
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:03,817
What do you want me to understand?

683
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,356
You want me to understand

684
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:08,523
you don't want to be accountable?

685
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:09,942
Poon Shing Fung, mind your words.

686
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:11,483
I lost a leg. Why?

687
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:12,942
For work.

688
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:18,317
You won't even give me a chance.

689
00:50:18,692 --> 00:50:19,565
You think I'm a waste of your time?

690
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:21,442
UI63660,

691
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,108
we're aware of your valor

692
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,108
and have been more than considerate.

693
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:39,650
You had a fallout?

694
00:50:40,525 --> 00:50:42,067
Didn't you tell them

695
00:50:42,692 --> 00:50:44,858
in order to get back to EOD, how hard I have worked?

696
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:45,400
I did.

697
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,733
You did not.

698
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:48,858
You don't want me back.

699
00:50:48,942 --> 00:50:50,442
Why would I do that?

700
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:51,317
Fine!

701
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,983
If I wrote a petition to the CP (Commissioner of Police),

702
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:55,442
will you co-sign it?

703
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:56,233
What petition?

704
00:50:56,275 --> 00:50:57,233
You won't!

705
00:50:57,275 --> 00:50:59,025
I will! I definitely will.

706
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,356
But Tung Cheuk Man is too small a potato

707
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,358
to make them change the system.

708
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,775
You're right!

709
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:13,442
Absolutely right!

710
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:20,608
On January 15, 2015,

711
00:51:20,775 --> 00:51:23,690
colleagues of EODB, Tung Cheuk Man and Poon Shing Fung

712
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:25,065
risked their lives

713
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:27,733
to defuse a bomb and saved two civilians.

714
00:51:27,942 --> 00:51:30,858
The Hong Kong Police hereby awards them the MBG (Medal for Bravery - Gold)

715
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,856
to commend them for their noble act of risking their lives to save others.

716
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,567
Let's have

717
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:37,317
CIP Tung Cheuk Man of EODB.

718
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,108
Now, let's have CIP Poon Shing Fung.

719
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:08,233
"The Police is ungrateful. I'm now dispensable."

720
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,358
No, Poon Sir!

721
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:11,190
Don't do this, Poon Sir!

722
00:52:11,192 --> 00:52:11,815
No pictures!

723
00:52:11,817 --> 00:52:12,733
Don't do this, Poon Sir!

724
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,858
No pictures!

725
00:52:23,317 --> 00:52:24,065
No pictures!

726
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:24,983
Watch out, Tung Sir!

727
00:52:28,317 --> 00:52:29,692
No pictures!

728
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:34,025
No pictures!

729
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:35,692
Assault!

730
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,567
Assault!

731
00:52:38,817 --> 00:52:40,025
Assault!

732
00:52:40,608 --> 00:52:42,442
Every newspaper mentioned the assault.

733
00:52:42,483 --> 00:52:44,650
None reported what I protested against.

734
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,400
They don't care about me. Fine!

735
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:48,733
Don't they care about justice?

736
00:52:48,817 --> 00:52:49,940
What about the truth?

737
00:52:49,942 --> 00:52:52,025
Never mind what they wrote.

738
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:53,483
I'd be just as angry.

739
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:55,398
But what you did was wrong.

740
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,817
What did I do wrong?

741
00:52:57,775 --> 00:53:00,192
You can go back after your injury, but I can't.

742
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:01,358
I'm only fighting for what I deserved.

743
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,733
What's wrong with that?

744
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:03,942
That's what I'm doing.

745
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:05,983
But after what you did, there's no turning back.

746
00:53:06,025 --> 00:53:07,400
How long will it take?

747
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:08,398
One year?

748
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:08,815
Two?

749
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:09,483
Three?

750
00:53:09,525 --> 00:53:11,817
You're my buddy. You should be on my side.

751
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:13,108
Come with me to protest.

752
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,065
- Our job is to serve the people, - We go together.

753
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,606
- not serve our own purpose. - Protest.

754
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:17,981
Protest…complain…

755
00:53:17,983 --> 00:53:19,858
Hey, get a grip!

756
00:53:21,192 --> 00:53:23,150
What kind of a fool do you take me for?

757
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:28,731
Everyone thinks I'm sick.

758
00:53:28,733 --> 00:53:30,317
And you are!

759
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,025
The world is sick!

760
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,606
Back then,

761
00:53:49,608 --> 00:53:51,608
you turned a deaf ear to everything I said.

762
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,900
You treated the world like your enemy.

763
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,317
But when my Mom died,

764
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,067
you came to show your last respects.

765
00:53:58,483 --> 00:53:59,608
Remember that?

766
00:54:02,358 --> 00:54:03,983
Family and friends, all rise!

767
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:09,150
Everyone, please bow your heads.

768
00:54:10,775 --> 00:54:12,108
Family, press the button.

769
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,400
The ceremony is over.

770
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:25,525
Please step out of the hall.

771
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:41,275
Alone?

772
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,815
If I can manage, I'll do it alone.

773
00:54:45,817 --> 00:54:46,900
How's business?

774
00:54:47,442 --> 00:54:48,608
Tough.

775
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:49,983
People nowadays

776
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,858
toss whatever is broken.

777
00:54:52,442 --> 00:54:53,983
They don't want to fix things.

778
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:55,900
Congrats!

779
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:57,817
You defused another wartime bomb.

780
00:54:59,483 --> 00:55:01,442
Next week, I'm taking the team out to dinner.

781
00:55:02,692 --> 00:55:03,650
How nice!

782
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:05,733
If...

783
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:07,648
I were still with EOD,

784
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,733
who do you think will be treating dinner?

785
00:55:14,275 --> 00:55:15,108
Look,

786
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,858
Pong's house-warming.

787
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:20,358
King To's new baby.

788
00:55:21,442 --> 00:55:22,317
Look.

789
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:24,400
Congratulate them for me.

790
00:55:26,025 --> 00:55:28,400
The team wants to see you.

791
00:55:28,983 --> 00:55:30,025
But I don't.

792
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:33,317
Actually…

793
00:55:38,817 --> 00:55:40,442
Can't think of anything to say?

794
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:42,900
You should leave.

795
00:55:49,317 --> 00:55:51,192
Thanks for paying my Mom your last respects.

796
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,648
I also want to know

797
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,817
who is Pong Ling.

798
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:06,400
She is your ex.

799
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,358
She asked me

800
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,398
if I can carry on my mission.

801
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,608
You saw her?

802
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:14,525
What mission do I have?

803
00:56:14,983 --> 00:56:15,942
I don't know.

804
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:27,067
Pick this up at the foot of the mountain.

805
00:56:33,775 --> 00:56:34,358
Pong Ling,

806
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
it's Tung Cheuk Man.

807
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,942
Fung just came to see me.

808
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:39,067
He said you told him he had a mission.

809
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,106
What mission?

810
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:40,692
Sorry!

811
00:56:40,733 --> 00:56:43,150
It's highly classified. I can't tell you.

812
00:56:56,817 --> 00:56:58,233
Why did you let me go?

813
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:01,067
You're an UC (undercover) for the CTRU (Counter Terrorism Response Unit).

814
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:02,858
I'm your handler.

815
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:07,025
I don't remember anything.

816
00:57:08,483 --> 00:57:09,983
But I remember your face

817
00:57:10,317 --> 00:57:11,608
and your name.

818
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,190
If you were to tell me we're dating each other, I'll believe you.

819
00:57:16,192 --> 00:57:17,400
We used to.

820
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:23,150
I treated you horribly?

821
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:26,233
No, you were great.

822
00:57:27,942 --> 00:57:30,942
But after you lost your leg, you became a different person.

823
00:57:31,525 --> 00:57:33,108
"The Police is ungrateful. I'm now dispensable"

824
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:35,317
Poon Sir! Don't do this!

825
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:38,898
What do you mean dispensable?

826
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,481
They transferred you to a desk job with the PPRB.

827
00:57:40,483 --> 00:57:41,440
You didn't want it.

828
00:57:41,442 --> 00:57:42,775
You're my girlfriend.

829
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:44,565
You should know how I feel.

830
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:46,025
I do.

831
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:49,065
But the disciplinary services require physical fitness.

832
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:50,692
There's nothing wrong with me.

833
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,481
With your leg like this, how can you defuse a bomb? How can...

834
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:54,025
I don't defuse bomb with my leg.

835
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:55,442
I use my hands.

836
00:57:55,942 --> 00:57:57,233
Other than me,

837
00:57:58,358 --> 00:57:59,981
no one can tell me no.

838
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:01,608
You're disabled.

839
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,440
How can you protect civilians?

840
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:06,192
Then why can Tung Cheuk Man go back and I can't?

841
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,525
His injury is different from yours.

842
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,525
How different?

843
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:21,442
You mean he's not handicapped,

844
00:58:22,025 --> 00:58:23,231
but I am?

845
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,148
That's not what I mean...

846
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,317
Do I have to make a bomb,

847
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:29,400
then defuse it to prove myself?

848
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:32,192
Listen to yourself!

849
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:34,400
You're a ticking bomb.

850
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,067
Fung, let's go see a doctor, OK?

851
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:45,817
I did.

852
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:48,775
I'm on meds.

853
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,650
I'm talking about a psychiatrist.

854
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:52,483
Let's go see a psychiatrist.

855
00:58:52,525 --> 00:58:54,150
I'm not crazy.

856
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:55,775
I'm hurting.

857
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:57,483
Do you understand?

858
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,733
I do.

859
00:58:59,817 --> 00:59:01,067
I do.

860
00:59:02,983 --> 00:59:05,275
I don't think we can stay together.

861
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,650
Get out!

862
00:59:08,692 --> 00:59:10,400
Get out!

863
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:18,400
Get out!

864
00:59:18,567 --> 00:59:19,317
No!

865
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:21,692
Fung, calm down.

866
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:23,233
Will you calm down?

867
00:59:23,692 --> 00:59:25,942
Yours and Man's injuries…that was an accident.

868
00:59:26,025 --> 00:59:28,233
No one knew it would end like this.

869
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:32,067
Fung! You can't blame anyone.

870
00:59:32,108 --> 00:59:33,275
Calm down!

871
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:34,067
Fung!

872
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:35,692
Fung!

873
00:59:35,983 --> 00:59:36,567
Fung!

874
00:59:36,692 --> 00:59:37,650
Fung!

875
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:51,275
Even though we broke up,

876
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:54,025
I have never given up on you.

877
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,442
I knew you always wanted to be a cop.

878
01:00:05,442 --> 01:00:06,192
Go away!

879
01:00:06,233 --> 01:00:07,775
What's your hurry?

880
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,900
I found a way to help you.

881
01:00:10,942 --> 01:00:11,692
Try me.

882
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,275
I know your anger got the better of you.

883
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,817
It finally clicked?

884
01:00:17,983 --> 01:00:19,817
Then why didn't you tell them?

885
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:21,858
What makes you think so?

886
01:00:27,942 --> 01:00:29,983
I know you want to be a cop again.

887
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:31,231
But they don't want me.

888
01:00:31,233 --> 01:00:32,233
That's not true.

889
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:34,858
They need someone exactly like you.

890
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:38,398
We received word from the FBI

891
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,190
about an extremist group called Vendetta

892
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:42,067
planning a terrorist attack in Hong Kong.

893
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:44,900
They're actively recruiting people who think alike.

894
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:46,650
After your accident,

895
01:00:46,692 --> 01:00:48,733
you began to hold extreme views and became anti-social.

896
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:51,442
These qualities fit their profile.

897
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,023
I suggested to Chan Sir to send you to Vendetta as an UC

898
01:00:55,025 --> 01:00:57,440
to catch the men behind the group, Ma Sai Kwan and Davy

899
01:00:57,442 --> 01:00:58,817
and stop the terrorist attack.

900
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,483
Here's the file on Vendetta.

901
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:04,106
Because there are terrorists,

902
01:01:04,108 --> 01:01:05,817
you don't think I'm crazy anymore.

903
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:09,650
The Poon Shing Fung I know would never stand by and watch people die.

904
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:12,648
Accept the offer and make an arrest,

905
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,567
Chan Sir will agree to reinstate you.

906
01:01:19,067 --> 01:01:20,608
Think it over.

907
01:01:29,942 --> 01:01:30,317
Hello?

908
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:32,025
I'm in.

909
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:34,525
Before the explosion,

910
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,442
you gave me the intel.

911
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:38,481
But we don't want to go public

912
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:39,942
and cause public panic.

913
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,525
So we let you in to defuse the bomb.

914
01:01:43,317 --> 01:01:44,525
In this operation,

915
01:01:45,442 --> 01:01:47,817
everyone thought you planted the bomb.

916
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:50,108
Only I know you went in to defuse it.

917
01:01:54,442 --> 01:01:55,608
After the explosion,

918
01:01:56,192 --> 01:01:58,817
we found some of your personal belongings.

919
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:00,567
Your phone got wet.

920
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:04,192
Luckily colleagues of Team D recovered the data inside.

921
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,025
Judging from the GPS records,

922
01:02:06,108 --> 01:02:08,025
you stayed in one place every night.

923
01:02:08,275 --> 01:02:09,900
Want to check it out?

924
01:02:52,733 --> 01:02:55,067
"Gabapentin Capsules for epilepsy/neuropathic pain"

925
01:03:22,192 --> 01:03:24,233
You said this one is most comfortable.

926
01:03:30,317 --> 01:03:32,150
I hope you can carry on your mission.

927
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:33,817
When you escaped from the hospital,

928
01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:35,731
Vendetta sent someone to your rescue,

929
01:03:35,733 --> 01:03:38,317
that proves you have become a crucial member of the group.

930
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,150
How did we meet?

931
01:03:50,983 --> 01:03:52,483
7 years ago,

932
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,442
we met at a Police cocktail party.

933
01:03:57,483 --> 01:03:58,650
You accidentally

934
01:03:58,775 --> 01:04:00,567
spilled red wine on my uniform.

935
01:04:01,692 --> 01:04:02,817
You apologized

936
01:04:03,067 --> 01:04:04,275
and I said it was OK.

937
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:06,900
Then you said you did it on purpose.

938
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:09,108
You meant to

939
01:04:09,442 --> 01:04:11,233
get my attention.

940
01:04:14,192 --> 01:04:15,358
Let's not go into that.

941
01:04:16,192 --> 01:04:16,942
This watch

942
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:18,650
has GPS and recording functions.

943
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,983
Wear it

944
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:22,025
and it can ensure your safety.

945
01:04:25,692 --> 01:04:27,317
Can I hug you?

946
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
I don't remember much.

947
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:39,192
I can't tell what's real

948
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:42,483
and what's not.

949
01:04:46,775 --> 01:04:48,025
If you trust me,

950
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:49,733
you're a cop.

951
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:51,858
If you don't,

952
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,275
you're a terrorist.

953
01:04:55,942 --> 01:04:57,525
Ask yourself

954
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:02,733
what kind of person is Poon Shing Fung.

955
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:08,358
Your top priority

956
01:05:08,692 --> 01:05:10,483
is to contact Vendetta,

957
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,650
help us catch Ma Sai Kwan

958
01:05:12,817 --> 01:05:14,525
and find out Davy's real identity

959
01:05:14,567 --> 01:05:16,483
in order to foil their terrorist attack.

960
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,192
Blizzard.

961
01:05:55,067 --> 01:05:56,983
After you lost your leg, you became so full of yourself,

962
01:05:57,108 --> 01:05:58,150
you drove yourself into a dead end.

963
01:05:58,567 --> 01:05:59,981
If I were still with EOD,

964
01:05:59,983 --> 01:06:01,525
who do you think will be treating dinner?

965
01:06:02,275 --> 01:06:03,815
After you lost your leg,

966
01:06:03,817 --> 01:06:05,192
you became a different person.

967
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,400
Pong Ling,

968
01:06:35,108 --> 01:06:36,067
tell me honestly,

969
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,898
what mission can Fung possibly have?

970
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:38,775
Man,

971
01:06:39,483 --> 01:06:41,106
I told you it's classified. I can't tell you.

972
01:06:41,108 --> 01:06:43,775
He's a suspect in a bombing incident that killed 18 people.

973
01:06:43,942 --> 01:06:45,525
He's an armed fugitive.

974
01:06:45,567 --> 01:06:47,192
Every cop in town is looking for him.

975
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:49,483
He doesn't remember any mission.

976
01:06:49,525 --> 01:06:50,900
You know the kind of danger he's in?

977
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,150
You asked him to find terrorists.

978
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:59,233
If you really want to know, talk to Chan Sir.

979
01:07:04,442 --> 01:07:06,192
Someone who suffers from declarative memory loss,

980
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:07,983
may form a new consciousness,

981
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:11,358
exhibit a new temperament, develop new concepts

982
01:07:11,483 --> 01:07:13,483
or even form a new outlook on right and wrong.

983
01:07:13,525 --> 01:07:15,400
He can become a different person.

984
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,858
Sir,

985
01:07:19,317 --> 01:07:20,275
I have an idea.

986
01:07:20,317 --> 01:07:21,733
Madam Pong, I'd like you to meet

987
01:07:21,775 --> 01:07:23,983
Professor Wong Ching Yi and Dr. Lam Chi Ming.

988
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,775
Hello!

989
01:07:24,858 --> 01:07:25,356
Hello!

990
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:26,400
"Dr. Lam Chi Ming Specialist in Neurology"

991
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,067
Hello!

992
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:27,733
Hello!

993
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:30,233
"Wong Ching Yi Professor in Clinical Psychology"

994
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:09,567
You're Pong Ling.

995
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:11,442
He still remembers my name.

996
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:13,481
We can implant memories,

997
01:08:13,483 --> 01:08:15,067
but not feelings.

998
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,773
You're still inside his subconscious

999
01:08:16,775 --> 01:08:18,733
that means he still misses you,

1000
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:22,025
though he may not remember what happened in the past.

1001
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:26,108
I only want to know if this will affect our plan.

1002
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,858
According to past research,

1003
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:29,692
even though implanted memories need

1004
01:08:29,733 --> 01:08:31,067
to be substantiated by actual events

1005
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,108
and not something fabricated,

1006
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,692
it's also best that someone trustworthy to the subject

1007
01:08:36,775 --> 01:08:38,108
can verify everything.

1008
01:08:39,025 --> 01:08:39,858
Madam Pong,

1009
01:08:41,983 --> 01:08:43,483
I do not doubt you.

1010
01:08:43,983 --> 01:08:45,608
On the contrary, I need to tell you

1011
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:47,358
your relationship with Poon Shing Fung

1012
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:50,692
is in our favor when we implant fake memory.

1013
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:53,025
You're an UC for the CTRU,

1014
01:08:53,692 --> 01:08:54,900
and I'm your handler.

1015
01:09:18,358 --> 01:09:20,025
Do you know why

1016
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,275
Fung became what he is today?

1017
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:27,233
He wanted to be reinstated back then,

1018
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:29,440
you rejected him because you didn't want to take the rap.

1019
01:09:29,442 --> 01:09:30,483
Now that he has amnesia,

1020
01:09:30,525 --> 01:09:33,567
you had the nerve to tell him he's working undercover?

1021
01:09:33,858 --> 01:09:35,565
He can't even remember if he's a cop!

1022
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:36,983
What's wrong with you people?

1023
01:09:37,358 --> 01:09:39,108
If we had other options,

1024
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,525
I wouldn't have accepted Madam Pong's suggestion.

1025
01:09:42,858 --> 01:09:45,775
In order to close file, you're capable of anything!

1026
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:52,650
What if he got himself killed?

1027
01:09:52,817 --> 01:09:54,608
Will that be in the line of duty, Madam?

1028
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:57,108
He has no record with the Hong Kong Police!

1029
01:09:58,025 --> 01:10:00,192
Fung already lost the job he loved.

1030
01:10:02,192 --> 01:10:03,192
He lost a leg.

1031
01:10:04,817 --> 01:10:06,150
He had nothing left.

1032
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:09,231
I understand.

1033
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:10,983
Sorry, Sir! I don't think you do.

1034
01:10:12,067 --> 01:10:13,608
We should be helping him.

1035
01:10:13,733 --> 01:10:15,067
Not lying to him.

1036
01:10:15,192 --> 01:10:16,817
He was your boyfriend.

1037
01:10:17,108 --> 01:10:17,981
I wanted to help him.

1038
01:10:17,983 --> 01:10:19,108
By pushing him off the cliff?

1039
01:10:19,275 --> 01:10:20,900
To atone for his crime.

1040
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:23,565
The explosion at the hotel,

1041
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:24,773
based on prima facie evidence,

1042
01:10:24,775 --> 01:10:26,900
he's likely to get a life sentence.

1043
01:10:28,025 --> 01:10:29,858
But if he helped the Police

1044
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:31,733
take out Vendetta

1045
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,192
and stop the terrorist attack,

1046
01:10:34,025 --> 01:10:35,025
we'll have a reason

1047
01:10:35,608 --> 01:10:37,483
to make a plea to the judge.

1048
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,192
Or else,

1049
01:10:39,525 --> 01:10:41,525
he'll always be...

1050
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:44,108
...a wanted man.

1051
01:10:52,858 --> 01:10:54,233
Atone for his crime?

1052
01:10:56,983 --> 01:10:58,608
Use his life

1053
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:01,108
to save 100 other lives?

1054
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:04,525
That's what you call atoning for his crime?

1055
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:07,898
You're his buddy.

1056
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,150
You tell me.

1057
01:11:11,275 --> 01:11:12,567
How can he ever go back

1058
01:11:13,067 --> 01:11:15,192
to be the Poon Shing Fung we know?

1059
01:11:15,983 --> 01:11:17,317
Tell me!

1060
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:24,608
The Poon Shing Fung we know,

1061
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,775
will risk his life

1062
01:11:30,317 --> 01:11:31,733
to save others.

1063
01:11:46,358 --> 01:11:46,942
Madam,

1064
01:11:46,983 --> 01:11:48,690
Poon Shing Fung went inside a coffee shop.

1065
01:11:48,692 --> 01:11:51,233
In that area, flyovers blocked the roadcams.

1066
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,481
The black vehicle across the street

1067
01:12:02,483 --> 01:12:03,608
will pick you up.

1068
01:12:14,608 --> 01:12:16,150
Madam, we lost the GPS signal.

1069
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,398
Probably from interference. But we still have audio.

1070
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,567
Where are we going?

1071
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,606
"The Water Margin"

1072
01:12:51,608 --> 01:12:52,442
Blizzard,

1073
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,025
we meet at last!

1074
01:12:55,275 --> 01:12:56,525
I'm Money.

1075
01:12:58,858 --> 01:13:00,067
I'm Slave.

1076
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,567
Sniper.

1077
01:13:10,108 --> 01:13:10,942
Blizzard,

1078
01:13:12,608 --> 01:13:13,398
welcome back!

1079
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,025
Thanks.

1080
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:16,233
The Boss is worried about you.

1081
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,190
After you left the hospital,

1082
01:13:18,192 --> 01:13:19,650
why didn't you contact us right away?

1083
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:21,733
When I woke up,

1084
01:13:21,817 --> 01:13:23,817
I don't remember much.

1085
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,400
After I broke out of the hospital,

1086
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,233
I had the cops on my tail.

1087
01:13:27,567 --> 01:13:28,690
I didn't want to get anyone in trouble.

1088
01:13:28,692 --> 01:13:29,942
That's why I didn't make contact.

1089
01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:31,733
You're always very careful.

1090
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:33,815
We have so much to learn from you.

1091
01:13:33,817 --> 01:13:34,650
I'm sorry!

1092
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,190
I made a mistake and you had to fill in for me.

1093
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:37,025
I almost got you in trouble.

1094
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:38,231
You did a great job

1095
01:13:38,233 --> 01:13:39,275
with the lighting ceremony.

1096
01:13:39,317 --> 01:13:41,108
They're talking about the hotel explosion.

1097
01:13:41,442 --> 01:13:42,692
The Boss is tied up.

1098
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,067
He can't meet with you.

1099
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:46,442
He told us to contact him after we picked you up.

1100
01:13:49,817 --> 01:13:50,692
Blizzard,

1101
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,067
I'm glad you're back.

1102
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:53,981
Our plan

1103
01:13:53,983 --> 01:13:55,233
will proceed as scheduled.

1104
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:57,692
Nothing will stop Resurrection Day.

1105
01:13:57,775 --> 01:13:59,025
It's probably Ma Sai Kwan.

1106
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:00,775
Do a voice analysis and track the signal.

1107
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:01,440
Yes, Madam!

1108
01:14:01,442 --> 01:14:02,692
I already told you

1109
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:04,442
Our minds are in sync

1110
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:05,858
and we're comrades with the same belief.

1111
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:06,942
Vendetta

1112
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,692
has not let me down.

1113
01:14:09,275 --> 01:14:10,108
Not now,

1114
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:12,275
not ever.

1115
01:14:14,067 --> 01:14:14,817
Now...

1116
01:14:14,858 --> 01:14:16,648
Madam, we have voice confirmation.

1117
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:17,356
It's definitely Ma Sai Kwan.

1118
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:18,565
We have waited long enough for Davy.

1119
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:19,731
I have more good news.

1120
01:14:19,733 --> 01:14:21,440
I just picked up Davy.

1121
01:14:21,442 --> 01:14:22,608
Davy is here!

1122
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:23,692
Do we have the location?

1123
01:14:23,733 --> 01:14:24,817
Still tracking.

1124
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,025
See?

1125
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,858
Yes!

1126
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:33,900
After Davy settles down,

1127
01:14:34,192 --> 01:14:35,192
I'll come to you.

1128
01:14:35,233 --> 01:14:36,275
Whatever you need,

1129
01:14:36,317 --> 01:14:37,442
just tell Rhino.

1130
01:14:37,817 --> 01:14:38,775
OK?

1131
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:40,400
We lost the signal.

1132
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:41,983
Do we have the location?

1133
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:42,858
No!

1134
01:14:43,733 --> 01:14:45,233
The Boss has a present for you.

1135
01:14:45,608 --> 01:14:46,817
It's the latest model.

1136
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:48,900
You're now a wanted man.

1137
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,733
You must be careful.

1138
01:14:51,733 --> 01:14:53,358
Don't go home.

1139
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,483
The Police locked down the place and it will be heavily guarded.

1140
01:15:09,608 --> 01:15:11,400
You should know by now,

1141
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:14,567
I'd rather die than betray a comrade.

1142
01:15:20,275 --> 01:15:21,481
No wonder the Boss trusts you

1143
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,692
and never once doubted you'd be a rat.

1144
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:29,273
Let's roll!

1145
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,233
Out to the open sea!

1146
01:15:42,358 --> 01:15:44,358
We just lost the voice signal.

1147
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:09,773
Here…

1148
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:11,108
A toast to Doctor.

1149
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:11,900
Cheers!

1150
01:16:12,817 --> 01:16:13,817
Doctor was a hero.

1151
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,817
But so what?

1152
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,400
Only we'd remember him.

1153
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:20,858
No one else would.

1154
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,900
Blizzard,

1155
01:16:22,567 --> 01:16:23,400
you taught me

1156
01:16:23,483 --> 01:16:25,898
I should place the index finger tip on the trigger

1157
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,731
of a sniper rifle for a better aim.

1158
01:16:27,733 --> 01:16:29,067
I'll remember that.

1159
01:16:29,442 --> 01:16:30,442
But

1160
01:16:30,733 --> 01:16:33,315
when I pick up a rifle to do something meaningful,

1161
01:16:33,317 --> 01:16:35,150
I want to go out with a bang.

1162
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:36,648
Whether anyone will remember me,

1163
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:37,900
I don't care.

1164
01:16:38,483 --> 01:16:39,733
Maverick told us that

1165
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,942
being brave is the key to facing life.

1166
01:16:42,025 --> 01:16:43,692
We all have to die.

1167
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:44,317
Yes!

1168
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:45,733
Be brave!

1169
01:16:45,983 --> 01:16:47,525
A true genius

1170
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:50,192
will not be KO'd by this sick society.

1171
01:16:50,275 --> 01:16:51,900
We must fight back!

1172
01:16:51,942 --> 01:16:52,483
Cheers!

1173
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:53,400
Cheers!

1174
01:16:57,192 --> 01:16:58,942
When I was in the hospital, what have you been doing?

1175
01:16:58,983 --> 01:17:00,233
We followed your instructions

1176
01:17:00,317 --> 01:17:01,233
and made bombs.

1177
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:02,317
Bombs?

1178
01:17:02,358 --> 01:17:02,900
Yes!

1179
01:17:02,942 --> 01:17:04,192
You and Maverick had it mapped out.

1180
01:17:04,233 --> 01:17:06,567
The prelude to Resurrection Day.

1181
01:17:09,817 --> 01:17:10,317
Good!

1182
01:17:15,817 --> 01:17:17,190
Do you have the suspect who placed the bomb?

1183
01:17:17,192 --> 01:17:19,440
CCTV captured a man wearing a mask

1184
01:17:19,442 --> 01:17:21,275
who placed it around noon.

1185
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:22,442
Should be a lone wolf.

1186
01:17:22,858 --> 01:17:24,567
5 kg of C-4

1187
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,233
could be deadly.

1188
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:29,358
The design of the bomb isn't complicated.

1189
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:30,608
But this device

1190
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,275
has an unusual direction.

1191
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:34,483
It's pointing down.

1192
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,692
We have cables and gas pipes underground.

1193
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:37,650
When it blows,

1194
01:17:37,692 --> 01:17:39,858
the chain reaction will cause a regional airblast

1195
01:17:40,025 --> 01:17:40,983
that can be disastrous.

1196
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:44,150
"Good guys stay away"

1197
01:17:44,692 --> 01:17:45,692
It's the media.

1198
01:17:46,525 --> 01:17:47,650
Get rid of the drone.

1199
01:17:47,692 --> 01:17:48,733
Yes, Madam!

1200
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:07,692
The best is yet to come.

1201
01:18:20,483 --> 01:18:21,275
"Private number"

1202
01:18:25,983 --> 01:18:26,900
The phone is ringing.

1203
01:18:28,108 --> 01:18:29,150
I'm picking up.

1204
01:18:32,733 --> 01:18:34,067
"Handsfree mode"

1205
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:35,900
Hello?

1206
01:18:35,942 --> 01:18:36,898
Calling EOD,

1207
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:37,692
what is Tung Sir doing?

1208
01:18:37,733 --> 01:18:38,942
There's a phone on the bomb.

1209
01:18:38,983 --> 01:18:39,858
Someone just called.

1210
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:40,692
Who?

1211
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:42,567
We don't know. I'll put it through.

1212
01:18:42,858 --> 01:18:43,567
You must be

1213
01:18:43,608 --> 01:18:45,400
Tung Cheuk Man, the EODB officer.

1214
01:18:45,733 --> 01:18:46,608
Who are you?

1215
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:48,148
Just an ordinary citizen.

1216
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:50,317
Unlike you, Tung Sir, I'm not in the news.

1217
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,650
It's just a job.

1218
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:54,483
Cops are very different from civilians.

1219
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:55,858
I really want to know,

1220
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:58,523
if a cop and a civilian

1221
01:18:58,525 --> 01:18:59,817
are both shot,

1222
01:18:59,942 --> 01:19:01,358
who will you save first?

1223
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:02,608
I'm working.

1224
01:19:02,983 --> 01:19:04,192
I don't have time to think.

1225
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:05,358
To! Scissors!

1226
01:19:05,442 --> 01:19:06,275
Yes, Sir!

1227
01:19:18,858 --> 01:19:19,858
Man.

1228
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:24,942
Find cover!

1229
01:19:27,317 --> 01:19:28,317
Such precision!

1230
01:19:31,775 --> 01:19:32,483
Stay back!

1231
01:19:32,525 --> 01:19:33,858
Tung Sir! Your position is too dangerous.

1232
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,067
Pull out!

1233
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,525
My suit is bulletproof.

1234
01:19:40,983 --> 01:19:42,192
Try to save To.

1235
01:19:44,733 --> 01:19:46,150
Search sniper's location.

1236
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:52,608
Don't go out there!

1237
01:19:58,942 --> 01:20:01,025
I heard you said your bomb suit can protect you.

1238
01:20:01,983 --> 01:20:02,983
Let's see.

1239
01:20:14,525 --> 01:20:15,315
Did you find him?

1240
01:20:15,317 --> 01:20:15,983
No, Madam!

1241
01:20:16,025 --> 01:20:16,650
Keep looking.

1242
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:17,192
Hurry!

1243
01:20:30,775 --> 01:20:31,690
Sniper's location

1244
01:20:31,692 --> 01:20:33,525
should be at my 5 or 6 o’clock.

1245
01:20:36,275 --> 01:20:37,817
Madam, out of range.

1246
01:20:38,192 --> 01:20:38,817
Go!

1247
01:20:56,733 --> 01:20:57,150
What is it?

1248
01:20:57,192 --> 01:20:57,983
Police!

1249
01:20:58,025 --> 01:20:58,817
Stay here.

1250
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,150
Bomb clear!

1251
01:21:56,983 --> 01:21:57,692
To!

1252
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:01,733
Ambulance!

1253
01:22:02,192 --> 01:22:02,775
To!

1254
01:22:03,108 --> 01:22:04,317
To! Stay awake! To!

1255
01:22:09,317 --> 01:22:09,815
Police!

1256
01:22:09,817 --> 01:22:10,608
Drop your weapon!

1257
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:13,233
Hey!

1258
01:22:13,525 --> 01:22:14,483
Hey!

1259
01:22:19,983 --> 01:22:20,775
Sniper down!

1260
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,940
Place your men in deadly peril and they will survive.

1261
01:22:22,942 --> 01:22:24,565
Leave them in dire straits and they're reborn.

1262
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:25,275
Salute!

1263
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:36,817
Ambulance!

1264
01:22:37,025 --> 01:22:37,775
Hurry!

1265
01:22:37,817 --> 01:22:38,983
To, look at me!

1266
01:22:39,025 --> 01:22:39,692
To!

1267
01:22:39,942 --> 01:22:40,817
Hang in there!

1268
01:22:41,692 --> 01:22:42,942
Ambulance!

1269
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:43,858
To!

1270
01:22:44,733 --> 01:22:45,942
Look at me!

1271
01:22:46,525 --> 01:22:47,442
Look at me!

1272
01:22:49,358 --> 01:22:50,733
Sir, let us take over.

1273
01:23:30,775 --> 01:23:33,317
I missed you…

1274
01:23:36,317 --> 01:23:38,025
It breaks my heart.

1275
01:23:38,525 --> 01:23:40,775
I want you to come home.

1276
01:23:46,608 --> 01:23:48,858
Even though I don't remember who they were.

1277
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:52,817
I still feel bad.

1278
01:23:57,733 --> 01:23:59,733
Where you took me was not my home.

1279
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:02,608
I'm a terrorist.

1280
01:24:04,108 --> 01:24:06,650
Whose idea was it, lying to me about being an UC?

1281
01:24:08,025 --> 01:24:09,233
Mine.

1282
01:24:11,442 --> 01:24:12,358
Yours?

1283
01:24:12,858 --> 01:24:15,858
If I said you were involved in 2 terrorist attacks

1284
01:24:16,233 --> 01:24:19,356
with a total casualty of 29 dead and 91 seriously injured,

1285
01:24:19,358 --> 01:24:21,025
how would you feel?

1286
01:24:22,275 --> 01:24:23,608
How would you feel?

1287
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:29,650
But when I look at these dead colleagues, I begin to wonder...

1288
01:24:30,025 --> 01:24:31,775
...if my plan was a mistake.

1289
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,233
Don't blame yourself.

1290
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:35,858
You did nothing wrong.

1291
01:24:38,942 --> 01:24:40,275
If I were in your shoes,

1292
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,400
I would have done the same.

1293
01:24:47,525 --> 01:24:48,567
I went back

1294
01:24:48,775 --> 01:24:50,731
and confirmed I'm a core member of Vendetta.

1295
01:24:50,733 --> 01:24:52,150
Davy

1296
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,692
is not a person.

1297
01:24:54,442 --> 01:24:55,525
It's a U.S.

1298
01:24:55,567 --> 01:24:57,775
nuclear bomb developed during the Cold War.

1299
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:01,067
Davy Crockett, as one of the smallest nuclear weapons ever built,

1300
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:02,067
its destructive power is

1301
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:05,150
between 10 and 20 tons of TNT equivalent.

1302
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,483
Resurrection Day

1303
01:25:06,567 --> 01:25:07,775
is the code name for an operation.

1304
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:09,400
The details of which

1305
01:25:09,817 --> 01:25:11,400
are still unknown.

1306
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,983
I must carry on with the mission

1307
01:25:20,525 --> 01:25:22,108
and I'll find out soon.

1308
01:25:34,233 --> 01:25:36,150
We chose this path together.

1309
01:25:36,942 --> 01:25:38,900
Even though I have only one leg,

1310
01:25:40,275 --> 01:25:41,483
you must stick with me

1311
01:25:42,733 --> 01:25:44,025
and see this through.

1312
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:48,567
You must be careful.

1313
01:25:50,608 --> 01:25:52,150
I will.

1314
01:26:02,483 --> 01:26:04,525
What was it like for us?

1315
01:26:06,692 --> 01:26:08,400
You were never in love with me,

1316
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,108
but I can't tell if it's real or not.

1317
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:41,733
The Boss wants to see you.

1318
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:58,481
Calling Madam,

1319
01:26:58,483 --> 01:26:59,442
the barge blew up.

1320
01:26:59,483 --> 01:27:00,650
They took Poon Shing Fung away.

1321
01:27:10,317 --> 01:27:10,858
Madam,

1322
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,275
we still have Poon Shing Fung's signal.

1323
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:14,233
He's probably meeting with Ma Sai Kwan.

1324
01:27:14,525 --> 01:27:16,150
CTRU, let's roll.

1325
01:27:25,733 --> 01:27:27,108
Hang back! Keep a 1 km distance.

1326
01:27:33,275 --> 01:27:33,856
Madam,

1327
01:27:33,858 --> 01:27:35,275
we lost the signal.

1328
01:27:36,525 --> 01:27:38,317
Probably by a radio interference device.

1329
01:27:42,608 --> 01:27:43,650
OK! Go!

1330
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:45,317
Boys, come on!

1331
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:45,983
Hurry up!

1332
01:27:51,608 --> 01:27:52,858
Hurry up!

1333
01:28:02,567 --> 01:28:04,817
"The Water Margin", never get bored from reading it.

1334
01:28:06,483 --> 01:28:09,067
Vendetta is like the Liangshan Marsh.

1335
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:11,442
I'm Chao Gai and you're Song Jiang.

1336
01:28:12,108 --> 01:28:13,858
I foot the bill, you come up with ideas

1337
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:15,900
upholding justice for Heaven.

1338
01:28:18,108 --> 01:28:20,150
I just didn't expect our ending

1339
01:28:20,858 --> 01:28:22,358
would be the same as "The Water Margin".

1340
01:28:22,692 --> 01:28:24,608
Song Jiang accepted the Court's amnesty

1341
01:28:25,942 --> 01:28:27,525
and betrayed his brothers.

1342
01:28:32,983 --> 01:28:34,400
Is the prosthetic any good?

1343
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:41,275
The lady you were with works for CTRU.

1344
01:28:41,442 --> 01:28:42,692
She was my ex-girlfriend.

1345
01:28:44,067 --> 01:28:45,108
I'm a man on the run,

1346
01:28:45,983 --> 01:28:47,400
she wanted me to turn myself in.

1347
01:28:51,067 --> 01:28:52,608
We were childhood friends,

1348
01:28:52,692 --> 01:28:55,067
comrades with the same beliefs.

1349
01:28:55,817 --> 01:28:57,317
How can I possibly doubt you?

1350
01:28:57,733 --> 01:28:58,525
By the way,

1351
01:28:59,608 --> 01:29:01,192
how long have we known each other?

1352
01:29:01,233 --> 01:29:02,317
I don't remember.

1353
01:29:03,567 --> 01:29:04,483
I have amnesia.

1354
01:29:04,775 --> 01:29:05,608
Amnesia?

1355
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:07,650
I'll have another go!

1356
01:29:07,692 --> 01:29:09,356
That's enough! Stop bullying Ma Sai Kwan!

1357
01:29:09,358 --> 01:29:10,442
We're playing with him.

1358
01:29:12,775 --> 01:29:14,692
I will always remember

1359
01:29:14,775 --> 01:29:17,108
how nice you were to me.

1360
01:29:21,275 --> 01:29:23,148
Why did they punish you for helping someone?

1361
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,650
They didn't punish me for helping you,

1362
01:29:25,692 --> 01:29:26,942
but for getting into a fight.

1363
01:29:27,025 --> 01:29:28,650
But they hit you first.

1364
01:29:28,692 --> 01:29:30,108
You were protecting yourself...

1365
01:29:31,025 --> 01:29:31,983
...and me.

1366
01:29:32,358 --> 01:29:33,650
I want to give you something.

1367
01:29:33,692 --> 01:29:34,733
Mastermind?

1368
01:29:34,983 --> 01:29:38,483
It has 6 colors to choose from to be placed into 4 slots.

1369
01:29:38,525 --> 01:29:40,525
You must guess the correct color and order.

1370
01:29:42,567 --> 01:29:43,567
You lost.

1371
01:29:44,108 --> 01:29:45,442
Let me see.

1372
01:29:46,233 --> 01:29:47,567
I can't believe it.

1373
01:29:47,608 --> 01:29:49,023
Wouldn't that be easier to guess?

1374
01:29:49,025 --> 01:29:51,315
You never said you can use the same color.

1375
01:29:51,317 --> 01:29:52,733
I like uniformity.

1376
01:29:52,817 --> 01:29:54,733
I hate people who change.

1377
01:29:54,983 --> 01:29:56,942
After high school, I went to the U.K.

1378
01:29:56,983 --> 01:29:58,858
I sent you a Christmas card every year.

1379
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,817
But after a few years, you stopped writing back.

1380
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:04,067
Until one year, the Christmas card I sent was returned.

1381
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:06,733
"Unable to Contact" was written on the envelope.

1382
01:30:06,775 --> 01:30:07,692
Then years later,

1383
01:30:07,775 --> 01:30:09,273
I saw you in the newspaper,

1384
01:30:09,275 --> 01:30:12,525
standing in front of a bomb with a big hole.

1385
01:30:13,025 --> 01:30:14,650
You became an EODB officer.

1386
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:16,192
Right there and then,

1387
01:30:17,275 --> 01:30:18,650
I was heartbroken.

1388
01:30:24,733 --> 01:30:25,692
Until one day,

1389
01:30:26,983 --> 01:30:30,275
I found out this system finally abandoned you.

1390
01:30:32,275 --> 01:30:33,858
The world is sick!

1391
01:30:34,858 --> 01:30:36,608
Do I have to make a bomb,

1392
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:39,108
then defuse it to prove myself?

1393
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:41,150
Listen to yourself!

1394
01:30:41,233 --> 01:30:42,942
You're a ticking bomb.

1395
01:30:43,733 --> 01:30:46,025
This is a society that

1396
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:48,525
everything is disposable after use,

1397
01:30:48,608 --> 01:30:49,942
including human beings.

1398
01:30:51,067 --> 01:30:52,692
When I read that message,

1399
01:30:52,775 --> 01:30:53,692
I knew

1400
01:30:54,192 --> 01:30:55,108
Blizzard

1401
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:56,817
is you.

1402
01:30:56,858 --> 01:30:58,356
Anger is not enough.

1403
01:30:58,358 --> 01:31:01,106
To turn this rotten system to ashes,

1404
01:31:01,108 --> 01:31:04,317
we need to be together as one against all others,

1405
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:07,567
- break all of their wings and make sure it crashes. - Courier

1406
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,942
To see a new beginning rise behind the sun,

1407
01:31:10,983 --> 01:31:12,817
we seek destruction.

1408
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,690
You finally came out from under

1409
01:31:17,692 --> 01:31:19,900
that "you got what you deserved" mentality.

1410
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:22,525
But the price you paid

1411
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:24,442
is your leg.

1412
01:31:27,025 --> 01:31:27,900
My dear friend,

1413
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:29,233
long time no see.

1414
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:31,692
I hope we can meet up and make some plans

1415
01:31:31,817 --> 01:31:34,317
to stop this world from getting worse.

1416
01:31:55,067 --> 01:31:55,983
Ma Sai Kwan?

1417
01:32:03,775 --> 01:32:04,608
Betrayal

1418
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:06,690
is nothing new.

1419
01:32:06,692 --> 01:32:08,650
Humans are full of weaknesses.

1420
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:11,025
But this operation is your design.

1421
01:32:13,067 --> 01:32:14,817
How can you beat Vendetta?

1422
01:32:16,483 --> 01:32:17,192
Who are you?

1423
01:32:17,233 --> 01:32:18,858
I don't know who I am.

1424
01:32:20,942 --> 01:32:22,483
I only wish to stop the terrorist attack.

1425
01:32:23,442 --> 01:32:24,358
Davy…

1426
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,650
you told me where to find it.

1427
01:32:26,358 --> 01:32:27,856
Why did you betray yourself?

1428
01:32:27,858 --> 01:32:29,275
Remember what you said?

1429
01:32:29,317 --> 01:32:30,898
I don't remember.

1430
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:31,358
What?

1431
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,733
I want to stop the terrorist attack.

1432
01:32:32,775 --> 01:32:33,358
You can't!

1433
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,608
I want to stop the terrorist attack.

1434
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:35,192
You cannot!

1435
01:32:35,233 --> 01:32:35,942
I want to stop it!

1436
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:37,775
You designed Resurrection Day.

1437
01:32:54,942 --> 01:32:55,858
Look!

1438
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,400
The world was beautiful.

1439
01:32:58,692 --> 01:33:01,275
But now, it's incurable.

1440
01:33:01,317 --> 01:33:03,233
All systems are like a tumor.

1441
01:33:03,442 --> 01:33:04,567
If you have cancer,

1442
01:33:04,608 --> 01:33:05,773
you need chemotherapy.

1443
01:33:05,775 --> 01:33:08,400
Use radiation to kill all the cancer cells.

1444
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:09,858
Better than waiting for death.

1445
01:33:10,025 --> 01:33:12,317
Waiting to die is a horrible feeling.

1446
01:33:12,733 --> 01:33:14,858
Scrap it and start over.

1447
01:33:15,025 --> 01:33:17,108
Place your men in deadly peril and they will survive.

1448
01:33:17,233 --> 01:33:19,442
Leave them in dire straits and they're reborn.

1449
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,567
In the olden days,

1450
01:33:26,608 --> 01:33:27,733
the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah

1451
01:33:27,817 --> 01:33:28,858
and the world-engulfing flood.

1452
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:30,025
Today,

1453
01:33:30,233 --> 01:33:32,067
we picked the date for Resurrection Day.

1454
01:33:32,317 --> 01:33:33,150
We can't stop!

1455
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,275
I beg you! Stop the terrorist attack! OK?

1456
01:33:36,692 --> 01:33:38,442
I'm begging you…

1457
01:33:38,858 --> 01:33:40,817
Please?

1458
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:41,731
Boss!

1459
01:33:41,733 --> 01:33:42,442
We're ready to roll.

1460
01:33:43,733 --> 01:33:44,692
Wait outside.

1461
01:33:44,817 --> 01:33:45,275
Yes!

1462
01:33:46,775 --> 01:33:48,023
I remember you said

1463
01:33:48,025 --> 01:33:50,150
waiting to die is a horrible feeling.

1464
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:54,733
Now,

1465
01:33:54,817 --> 01:33:57,025
I'll let you get a feel for that.

1466
01:34:22,817 --> 01:34:24,942
"New York World Trade Center (WTC), 5 Dead Thousands Injured"

1467
01:34:33,233 --> 01:34:35,150
International Finance Centre (IFC) !

1468
01:34:35,233 --> 01:34:36,733
We're blowing up IFC.

1469
01:34:36,858 --> 01:34:38,400
I planned Resurrection Day.

1470
01:34:38,483 --> 01:34:39,817
It was my plan.

1471
01:35:02,233 --> 01:35:03,315
Where is the bomb?

1472
01:35:03,317 --> 01:35:04,733
I don't remember.

1473
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:06,233
Calling Chan Sir,

1474
01:35:06,275 --> 01:35:07,565
Vendetta plans to blow up IFC.

1475
01:35:07,567 --> 01:35:08,942
We don't have details yet.

1476
01:35:21,817 --> 01:35:23,067
Evacuate IFC at once

1477
01:35:23,108 --> 01:35:24,192
and lock down the premises.

1478
01:35:24,233 --> 01:35:25,858
One IFC has 4 floors underground,

1479
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:26,858
38 floors above ground.

1480
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,942
Two IFC has 5 floors underground, 88 floors above ground.

1481
01:35:28,983 --> 01:35:31,150
With a floor area of 436,000 cubic meters

1482
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:32,317
and 80 elevators,

1483
01:35:32,358 --> 01:35:34,150
it'll take a while to find the bomb.

1484
01:35:40,942 --> 01:35:41,858
Mon, get the tools.

1485
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,483
Yes, Sir!

1486
01:35:42,567 --> 01:35:43,356
Everyone out!

1487
01:35:43,358 --> 01:35:44,023
Yes, Sir!

1488
01:35:44,025 --> 01:35:45,815
Follow me, everyone! Go Go Go!

1489
01:35:45,817 --> 01:35:46,773
Everybody, hurry up!

1490
01:35:46,775 --> 01:35:47,233
- Yes, Sir! - Let's go!

1491
01:35:49,233 --> 01:35:51,233
They were so close.

1492
01:35:51,983 --> 01:35:53,192
They have very limited resources,

1493
01:35:53,567 --> 01:35:55,692
and parked the car bomb at the wrong place.

1494
01:35:55,942 --> 01:35:56,692
In the end,

1495
01:35:56,733 --> 01:35:57,815
they only blew a hole in the ground.

1496
01:35:57,817 --> 01:35:59,400
What they failed to do,

1497
01:35:59,817 --> 01:36:01,067
we'll make it right.

1498
01:36:02,442 --> 01:36:04,025
Today is February 26.

1499
01:36:04,817 --> 01:36:07,275
Resurrection Day is modeled after the 1993 car bombing

1500
01:36:07,483 --> 01:36:09,273
of the WTC in New York on February 26.

1501
01:36:09,275 --> 01:36:11,567
Back then, the terrorists parked the truck carrying the bomb

1502
01:36:11,608 --> 01:36:12,775
in the North Tower parking garage.

1503
01:36:12,817 --> 01:36:14,358
The target was the main column of the North Tower.

1504
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,858
The intention was to send the taller North Tower

1505
01:36:16,108 --> 01:36:17,067
crashing into the lower South Tower.

1506
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,608
We learnt from that incident

1507
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:19,733
and decided to use C-4,

1508
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:22,483
which is destructive enough to bring down the main column of Two IFC.

1509
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,900
Two IFC would crumble towards the southwest

1510
01:36:27,233 --> 01:36:28,192
and crush One IFC.

1511
01:36:32,317 --> 01:36:32,983
Chan Sir,

1512
01:36:33,025 --> 01:36:34,440
the bomb should be in the garage of Two IFC,

1513
01:36:34,442 --> 01:36:35,606
near the main column on the southwest side.

1514
01:36:35,608 --> 01:36:37,273
Contact the Buildings Department for the IFC building plan.

1515
01:36:37,275 --> 01:36:37,775
Hurry!

1516
01:36:37,817 --> 01:36:38,275
Yes, Sir!

1517
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:39,817
Tung Sir, here.

1518
01:36:39,858 --> 01:36:40,692
This bomb

1519
01:36:40,775 --> 01:36:41,942
is a combination device,

1520
01:36:41,983 --> 01:36:42,983
made up of 4 components,

1521
01:36:43,025 --> 01:36:44,358
with a pre-set permutation

1522
01:36:44,483 --> 01:36:45,733
to stop the timer.

1523
01:36:46,817 --> 01:36:48,400
Each component is one out of five.

1524
01:36:48,442 --> 01:36:50,567
That's 625 combinations.

1525
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:52,400
You won't have time to disarm it.

1526
01:36:52,775 --> 01:36:53,358
Madam,

1527
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,483
I'm in charge here.

1528
01:36:54,692 --> 01:36:55,567
I'd like you to leave.

1529
01:36:56,192 --> 01:36:57,358
You should both leave.

1530
01:36:57,525 --> 01:36:58,858
Let me die alone.

1531
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,150
If you don't go to IFC,

1532
01:37:00,192 --> 01:37:01,150
a lot of people will die.

1533
01:37:01,192 --> 01:37:02,108
Pong Ling,

1534
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:03,731
2 minutes.

1535
01:37:03,733 --> 01:37:04,900
If I can't do it, I'll leave.

1536
01:37:05,108 --> 01:37:05,983
Go!

1537
01:37:26,275 --> 01:37:27,442
I'm Lun Ting Pong of EOD.

1538
01:37:27,483 --> 01:37:29,565
Evacuate everyone within IFC vicinity.

1539
01:37:29,567 --> 01:37:30,192
The mall,

1540
01:37:30,233 --> 01:37:30,815
office building,

1541
01:37:30,817 --> 01:37:31,565
MTR station

1542
01:37:31,567 --> 01:37:33,606
and all nearby public space. Over!

1543
01:37:33,608 --> 01:37:35,775
EOD, split up and look for the bomb in the parking lot!

1544
01:37:36,733 --> 01:37:38,150
Hurry!

1545
01:37:40,317 --> 01:37:42,775
Evacuate everyone in the mall.

1546
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:43,856
Hurry up!

1547
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,442
Due to an emergency,

1548
01:37:45,483 --> 01:37:46,942
the mall will be closed.

1549
01:37:46,983 --> 01:37:48,567
we need everyone to evacuate at once.

1550
01:37:49,233 --> 01:37:50,400
Keep moving! Hurry!

1551
01:37:54,233 --> 01:37:55,065
You said

1552
01:37:55,067 --> 01:37:57,317
we should not save lives by risking our own.

1553
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,775
Saving lives is my job.

1554
01:37:58,858 --> 01:38:00,317
I can be outside in 5 seconds.

1555
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,358
If I can't disarm the bomb,

1556
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:02,400
I can go for the lock.

1557
01:38:02,817 --> 01:38:04,565
It's a 4-digit lock. No numbers.

1558
01:38:04,567 --> 01:38:06,023
Red, yellow, blue, green, black and white.

1559
01:38:06,025 --> 01:38:07,025
6 colors.

1560
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:08,608
Choose 4 out of 6 colors.

1561
01:38:08,817 --> 01:38:10,608
1296 combinations.

1562
01:38:10,692 --> 01:38:11,692
That's even harder.

1563
01:38:14,108 --> 01:38:15,025
Mastermind!

1564
01:38:15,983 --> 01:38:16,940
I like uniformity.

1565
01:38:16,942 --> 01:38:18,483
I hate people who change.

1566
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:20,108
He really wants me to remember him.

1567
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:21,358
Go for the lock.

1568
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:22,358
Single color.

1569
01:38:23,358 --> 01:38:24,067
I'll try yellow.

1570
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:26,650
Wrong.

1571
01:38:27,358 --> 01:38:28,025
Blue.

1572
01:38:28,150 --> 01:38:30,650
You never said you can use one color.

1573
01:38:32,692 --> 01:38:33,567
Red!

1574
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:34,567
All red!

1575
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:43,817
Run!

1576
01:38:50,025 --> 01:38:51,025
To IFC!

1577
01:38:51,317 --> 01:38:52,150
To IFC!

1578
01:38:57,525 --> 01:38:58,648
Time fuse 20 meters.

1579
01:38:58,650 --> 01:38:59,900
We need 10 minutes to clear out.

1580
01:38:59,942 --> 01:39:00,983
Relax! I did the Maths.

1581
01:39:19,108 --> 01:39:20,483
All trains heading for Hong Kong

1582
01:39:20,525 --> 01:39:22,317
will terminate at Kowloon Station.

1583
01:39:22,442 --> 01:39:24,317
No train is allowed to enter Hong Kong Station.

1584
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:24,900
All trains heading for Hong Kong…

1585
01:39:24,942 --> 01:39:25,733
What’s happening?

1586
01:39:27,733 --> 01:39:29,067
We take control here.

1587
01:39:31,108 --> 01:39:32,440
If they use C-4 to blow up IFC,

1588
01:39:32,442 --> 01:39:33,442
what about Davy Crockett?

1589
01:39:33,817 --> 01:39:34,858
I will remember.

1590
01:39:36,025 --> 01:39:36,817
I will remember.

1591
01:39:37,317 --> 01:39:38,692
If nobody tries to be a hero,

1592
01:39:38,733 --> 01:39:39,983
we'll all get out in one piece.

1593
01:39:42,858 --> 01:39:43,775
Calling EOD,

1594
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:45,442
the main column on the southwest side

1595
01:39:45,483 --> 01:39:48,108
is between parking spaces #150 and #200. Over!

1596
01:39:48,192 --> 01:39:48,690
Roger!

1597
01:39:48,692 --> 01:39:49,648
Split up to different levels.

1598
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,483
Look for parking spaces between #150 and #200.

1599
01:39:51,525 --> 01:39:52,525
You two go down one level.

1600
01:39:52,567 --> 01:39:53,398
Fat Sze, give me the tools.

1601
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,442
- Follow me! - This way!

1602
01:39:54,483 --> 01:39:55,317
Excuse me…

1603
01:39:56,692 --> 01:39:57,148
Over here!

1604
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:58,817
Can't let them find the car.

1605
01:39:59,192 --> 01:40:00,775
-You can't go in. -This is locked down.

1606
01:40:00,817 --> 01:40:01,608
Hey!

1607
01:40:25,317 --> 01:40:25,817
Fat Sze!

1608
01:40:25,858 --> 01:40:26,567
Keep looking!

1609
01:40:26,608 --> 01:40:27,067
Yes sir!

1610
01:40:27,108 --> 01:40:27,775
Go!

1611
01:40:29,275 --> 01:40:29,731
What are you doing?

1612
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:30,358
Stop the car!

1613
01:40:32,942 --> 01:40:33,817
A car just ran the gate!

1614
01:40:35,733 --> 01:40:36,483
Sir! Excuse me,

1615
01:40:36,525 --> 01:40:37,733
this area has been sealed off.

1616
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,900
Everyone get out!

1617
01:40:40,983 --> 01:40:42,233
Take the booth!

1618
01:40:46,275 --> 01:40:47,065
Get on the ground!

1619
01:40:47,067 --> 01:40:48,275
Get down!

1620
01:40:48,317 --> 01:40:49,731
Everybody out…on the floor, now!

1621
01:40:49,733 --> 01:40:50,942
Get your heads down!

1622
01:40:52,567 --> 01:40:54,067
Everybody get down!

1623
01:40:56,108 --> 01:40:57,233
Open the gates.

1624
01:40:58,900 --> 01:40:59,650
Hurry it up!

1625
01:40:59,692 --> 01:41:00,190
Come on!

1626
01:41:00,192 --> 01:41:01,317
Come on! Hurry it up!

1627
01:41:01,358 --> 01:41:02,275
Tie them up!

1628
01:41:02,858 --> 01:41:04,567
Let's go! Give me your hands!

1629
01:41:08,483 --> 01:41:10,150
Shootout at Hong Kong Station.

1630
01:41:10,275 --> 01:41:11,525
Alpha Team, stay!

1631
01:41:11,567 --> 01:41:13,817
Beta Team, follow me across to Hong Kong Station L2.

1632
01:41:19,358 --> 01:41:21,192
Hurry, get up. Move on!

1633
01:41:21,233 --> 01:41:22,942
Move it!

1634
01:41:22,983 --> 01:41:24,983
Shoot them! Stand right here!

1635
01:41:25,067 --> 01:41:27,150
All cops, stay where you are!

1636
01:41:27,858 --> 01:41:29,900
If you take a step forward,

1637
01:41:30,108 --> 01:41:31,650
I will kill all the hostages.

1638
01:41:31,692 --> 01:41:34,025
Stay back! Don't come in here!

1639
01:41:34,108 --> 01:41:35,900
We will shoot the hostages!

1640
01:41:35,942 --> 01:41:37,942
Cops, we will shoot everyone!

1641
01:41:37,983 --> 01:41:39,192
Cops, stop!

1642
01:41:39,233 --> 01:41:40,733
Cops stop, stay back!

1643
01:41:40,775 --> 01:41:42,817
We will shoot you if you move forward.

1644
01:41:43,775 --> 01:41:44,567
What's the status?

1645
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:46,773
EOD is looking for the bomb in the parking lot of Two IFC.

1646
01:41:46,775 --> 01:41:49,065
Terrorists at Hong Kong Station occupied L2

1647
01:41:49,067 --> 01:41:50,567
and put the bomb on the train.

1648
01:41:54,775 --> 01:41:55,650
I remember now.

1649
01:41:55,775 --> 01:41:57,442
Resurrection Day is not just blowing up IFC,

1650
01:41:57,483 --> 01:41:59,692
but also the core infrastructure of the HK Airport.

1651
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,817
They will hijack the Airport Express.

1652
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,067
The train has 8 cabins and will be split into 3 sections,

1653
01:42:07,192 --> 01:42:08,525
each carrying a bomb.

1654
01:42:10,483 --> 01:42:13,025
When it passes through major infrastructure, they will leave one section behind.

1655
01:42:13,358 --> 01:42:14,400
The C-4 on the train

1656
01:42:14,442 --> 01:42:17,775
will blow up Elements at the Kowloon Station and Tsing Ma Bridge.

1657
01:42:17,817 --> 01:42:19,817
The engine will crash into the Hong Kong International Airport.

1658
01:42:19,858 --> 01:42:21,442
Davy Crockett will be in the front.

1659
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:24,983
The impact from the head-on collision

1660
01:42:25,067 --> 01:42:27,067
will trigger the wireless detonator,

1661
01:42:27,108 --> 01:42:28,650
and set off all the bombs simultaneously.

1662
01:42:28,692 --> 01:42:30,648
Davy Crockett will blow up the whole airport.

1663
01:42:30,650 --> 01:42:33,317
The radioactive contamination will leave Chek Lap Kok in ruins,

1664
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,358
and unable to rebuild in at least 20 years.

1665
01:42:37,733 --> 01:42:38,817
Don't move!

1666
01:42:38,858 --> 01:42:40,192
Get down!

1667
01:42:56,067 --> 01:42:57,942
The terrorists hijacked the train. Over.

1668
01:42:57,983 --> 01:42:59,358
Any way we can intercept it? Over.

1669
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,067
The Tsing Yi Control Center should be able to.

1670
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:02,648
But Vendetta has taken over.

1671
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:03,192
Over.

1672
01:43:03,233 --> 01:43:04,567
Chan Sir, there's a bomb on the train.

1673
01:43:04,608 --> 01:43:05,692
Lock down the Tsing Ma Bridge

1674
01:43:05,733 --> 01:43:07,400
and evacuate the airport and Airport Express.

1675
01:43:07,442 --> 01:43:07,817
Over.

1676
01:43:07,858 --> 01:43:08,400
Copy!

1677
01:43:09,025 --> 01:43:10,650
Due to an emergency,

1678
01:43:10,692 --> 01:43:12,358
everyone must leave the station at once!

1679
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,983
and evacuate to somewhere safe.

1680
01:43:14,025 --> 01:43:15,565
Due to a serious incident,

1681
01:43:15,567 --> 01:43:17,567
please leave the station immediately!

1682
01:43:29,983 --> 01:43:30,525
Calling Tung Sir!

1683
01:43:30,567 --> 01:43:32,275
We found the car bomb.

1684
01:43:32,317 --> 01:43:33,400
It's clear.

1685
01:43:33,733 --> 01:43:34,608
I don't care how,

1686
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:36,108
break into the Control Center

1687
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:38,942
and stop Ma Sai Kwan's train on the Tsing Ma Bridge.

1688
01:43:38,983 --> 01:43:40,525
We move the car bomb out there,

1689
01:43:40,567 --> 01:43:42,067
then blow up both ends of the bridge

1690
01:43:42,108 --> 01:43:43,775
and let the train fall into the water.

1691
01:43:43,858 --> 01:43:45,817
This is the only way to stop radiation diffusion

1692
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:47,817
and reduce casualties.

1693
01:44:02,275 --> 01:44:02,733
Brother Fung.

1694
01:44:02,775 --> 01:44:04,108
Sir, I'll go with you.

1695
01:44:04,192 --> 01:44:05,025
No, you stay!

1696
01:44:05,108 --> 01:44:06,192
Give your gear to Fung.

1697
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:28,692
We have C-4,

1698
01:44:28,733 --> 01:44:29,567
time fuse,

1699
01:44:29,817 --> 01:44:30,733
detonator

1700
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,400
and det cord in the back.

1701
01:44:34,608 --> 01:44:36,523
The Tsing Ma Bridge is a suspension bridge.

1702
01:44:36,525 --> 01:44:39,773
We split up and attach the C-4 to the 4 vertical cables

1703
01:44:39,775 --> 01:44:41,400
on the Ma Wan side,

1704
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:43,400
then connect the det cord and time fuse

1705
01:44:43,525 --> 01:44:45,150
and blow it up using the detonator.

1706
01:44:45,275 --> 01:44:46,358
There's no gunpowder.

1707
01:44:46,442 --> 01:44:47,275
Here!

1708
01:44:49,025 --> 01:44:50,608
I'll go to the back and split the det cord into two sections.

1709
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:51,650
Be careful!

1710
01:45:08,067 --> 01:45:09,233
Here…

1711
01:45:09,275 --> 01:45:11,442
Please follow instructions from ground personnel

1712
01:45:11,483 --> 01:45:12,900
and leave the station at once.

1713
01:45:16,775 --> 01:45:17,525
Pong Ling,

1714
01:45:18,275 --> 01:45:20,565
we use a time fuse to detonate C-4 to blow up the bridge.

1715
01:45:20,567 --> 01:45:22,856
But we must calculate the time we need to leave the bridge.

1716
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:24,231
If Davy Crockett goes off in the water,

1717
01:45:24,233 --> 01:45:25,190
it'll cause a shockwave

1718
01:45:25,192 --> 01:45:26,606
with a lethal range of 1 km.

1719
01:45:26,608 --> 01:45:28,731
How long will it take the chopper to reach the safety zone?

1720
01:45:28,733 --> 01:45:31,106
From when you board the chopper, it'll take 30 seconds.

1721
01:45:31,108 --> 01:45:33,733
Stop Ma Sai Kwan's train in the middle of the bridge.

1722
01:45:33,983 --> 01:45:35,731
We'll take over the Control Center ASAP

1723
01:45:35,733 --> 01:45:37,648
and stop Ma Sai Kwan's train on the bridge.

1724
01:45:37,650 --> 01:45:39,106
After you reach the safety zone,

1725
01:45:39,108 --> 01:45:40,275
we'll re-start the train

1726
01:45:40,317 --> 01:45:41,317
and let it fall into the water.

1727
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,400
Set the time fuse for 20 seconds.

1728
01:45:50,108 --> 01:45:50,815
Calling Lee Sir,

1729
01:45:50,817 --> 01:45:51,692
sniper ready.

1730
01:45:56,608 --> 01:45:58,108
They're shooting at us!

1731
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:01,025
Find cover!

1732
01:46:01,150 --> 01:46:02,150
They're shooting!

1733
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:03,692
I don't want to die!

1734
01:46:03,733 --> 01:46:04,650
Get out of my way!

1735
01:46:09,567 --> 01:46:10,150
Help!

1736
01:46:13,650 --> 01:46:14,442
Get down!

1737
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,650
A train stopped at Kowloon Station.

1738
01:46:37,025 --> 01:46:39,067
Pong, there's a bomb on the train.

1739
01:46:39,108 --> 01:46:40,400
I don't care how,

1740
01:46:40,442 --> 01:46:41,567
just move it.

1741
01:46:41,608 --> 01:46:42,025
Copy!

1742
01:46:42,067 --> 01:46:43,773
Chan Sir, is there a train at Hong Kong Station?

1743
01:46:43,775 --> 01:46:44,106
Yes!

1744
01:46:44,108 --> 01:46:45,317
On the other side of the tracks.

1745
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,440
Get me a train captain

1746
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:47,817
to teach me how to operate it.

1747
01:47:30,942 --> 01:47:31,775
Done!

1748
01:47:46,942 --> 01:47:48,983
Set the C-4 on the cables.

1749
01:48:15,692 --> 01:48:16,067
Go!

1750
01:48:16,108 --> 01:48:17,150
Yes, Madam!

1751
01:48:20,525 --> 01:48:23,192
"Kowloon Station"

1752
01:48:40,692 --> 01:48:41,192
Tung Sir,

1753
01:48:41,233 --> 01:48:43,817
I'm pushing the train car from Kowloon Station towards Tsing Ma Bridge.

1754
01:49:22,233 --> 01:49:23,942
Madam, we are ready.

1755
01:49:24,067 --> 01:49:24,567
Three…

1756
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,025
Two…

1757
01:49:25,067 --> 01:49:25,650
One…

1758
01:49:48,942 --> 01:49:49,983
Team B, action!

1759
01:49:55,483 --> 01:49:57,192
Grab the hostages!

1760
01:49:57,775 --> 01:49:58,942
Watch out for the hostages!

1761
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,358
Resurrection!

1762
01:50:22,983 --> 01:50:23,733
Get the lights!

1763
01:50:25,108 --> 01:50:26,650
Police! Calm down!

1764
01:50:26,692 --> 01:50:28,150
Stop the train on Tsing Ma Bridge!

1765
01:50:28,233 --> 01:50:28,983
I'll do it.

1766
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:30,317
- Evacuate the hostages. - Hurry!

1767
01:50:30,358 --> 01:50:31,608
Search the scene.

1768
01:50:34,567 --> 01:50:35,317
What happened?

1769
01:50:36,192 --> 01:50:36,775
What's wrong?

1770
01:50:36,817 --> 01:50:37,606
I can't control the train.

1771
01:50:37,608 --> 01:50:38,817
The train is still moving.

1772
01:50:38,858 --> 01:50:40,067
What happened?

1773
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:41,192
Check the control system.

1774
01:50:44,317 --> 01:50:45,317
Hit by a stray bullet.

1775
01:50:45,942 --> 01:50:46,858
Is there another way?

1776
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:47,650
No!

1777
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:50,150
Control Center is clear.

1778
01:50:50,192 --> 01:50:51,275
But the control system is not working.

1779
01:50:51,317 --> 01:50:52,608
We cannot stop Ma Sai Kwan.

1780
01:50:53,192 --> 01:50:55,942
The detonator will be set up in 90 seconds.

1781
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:57,775
We can get off the bridge in 90 seconds.

1782
01:50:57,817 --> 01:50:59,317
Ma Sai Kwan is 80 seconds away.

1783
01:50:59,358 --> 01:51:00,400
I'll hurry!

1784
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:01,775
We have enough time to set the detonator,

1785
01:51:01,817 --> 01:51:03,358
but not enough to reach the safety zone.

1786
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,442
Then you go ahead.

1787
01:51:04,608 --> 01:51:05,065
No!

1788
01:51:05,067 --> 01:51:06,067
We go together.

1789
01:51:06,108 --> 01:51:07,023
I can do this alone.

1790
01:51:07,025 --> 01:51:08,023
Why should two people die over this?

1791
01:51:08,025 --> 01:51:09,648
Then why should you stay and not me?

1792
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:11,192
There's no turning back.

1793
01:51:11,317 --> 01:51:13,358
You should know. Let me do this.

1794
01:51:20,775 --> 01:51:21,565
Sorry Tung Sir,

1795
01:51:21,567 --> 01:51:23,233
we need to clear out or we won't make it.

1796
01:51:25,192 --> 01:51:26,275
Go ahead!

1797
01:51:26,358 --> 01:51:27,483
I beg you!

1798
01:51:31,608 --> 01:51:32,942
Buddy,

1799
01:51:33,108 --> 01:51:34,150
goodbye!

1800
01:51:54,608 --> 01:51:55,275
Pong Ling,

1801
01:51:55,442 --> 01:51:56,400
he's still there.

1802
01:51:59,775 --> 01:52:00,858
Fung!

1803
01:52:02,775 --> 01:52:03,900
Fung!

1804
01:52:25,442 --> 01:52:26,817
All set!

1805
01:52:29,358 --> 01:52:31,150
All set!

1806
01:52:36,275 --> 01:52:37,233
Attention, all units!

1807
01:52:37,317 --> 01:52:39,942
Activate "CBRN" (Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear) emergency procedure right away!

1808
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:41,856
Hong Kong Observatory,

1809
01:52:41,858 --> 01:52:43,650
activate the radiation monitoring system.

1810
01:52:44,317 --> 01:52:45,190
Leisure and Cultural Services Department,

1811
01:52:45,192 --> 01:52:47,275
close and evacuate all beaches.

1812
01:52:47,317 --> 01:52:48,148
Hospital Authority,

1813
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:50,358
set up an emergency radiation treatment center.

1814
01:52:50,483 --> 01:52:51,398
Fire Services,

1815
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:55,023
standby 24/7 with ambulances and ready to conduct search and rescue.

1816
01:52:55,025 --> 01:52:56,275
Information Services Department,

1817
01:52:56,442 --> 01:52:58,898
appeal to all citizens to watch out for TV and radio announcements

1818
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:00,608
for rescue preparations.

1819
01:53:02,608 --> 01:53:03,567
Fung!

1820
01:53:05,275 --> 01:53:07,192
I'll see you in the next life.

1821
01:53:08,317 --> 01:53:09,567
Fung...

1822
01:53:15,817 --> 01:53:18,150
...remember my name is Pong Ling.

1823
01:53:19,025 --> 01:53:19,942
In the next life…

1824
01:56:13,317 --> 01:56:14,942
If memory can be implanted,

1825
01:56:16,067 --> 01:56:17,900
can you help me remove it?

1826
01:56:19,358 --> 01:56:20,817
All of it?

1827
01:56:22,525 --> 01:56:23,608
Except…

1828
01:56:24,067 --> 01:56:24,815
I'll get something to eat.

1829
01:56:24,817 --> 01:56:26,150
Sure. Go ahead!

1830
01:56:49,108 --> 01:56:50,481
Sorry! It was my fault.

1831
01:56:50,483 --> 01:56:51,067
It's OK.

1832
01:56:51,108 --> 01:56:52,150
I did it on purpose.

1833
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:53,775
What do you mean?

1834
01:56:54,067 --> 01:56:54,898
No special meaning.

1835
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:56,442
I only want you to remember me.

1836
01:57:00,858 --> 01:57:02,106
But I don't even know your name.

1837
01:57:02,108 --> 01:57:03,192
How can I remember you?

1838
01:57:05,275 --> 01:57:06,231
I'm Poon Shing Fung.

1839
01:57:06,233 --> 01:57:08,067
EODB officer.

1840
01:57:09,048 --> 01:57:14,048
