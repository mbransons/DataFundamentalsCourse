1
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:12,153
"I, Edwin Dennis,
being of sound mind and body...

2
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:17,113
...do hereby bequeath to my only son,
Patrick, all my worldly possessions.

3
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:22,018
In the event of my demise, I direct
Norah Muldoon to deliver Patrick...

4
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:26,686
...to my sister, Mame Dennis,
at 3 Beekman Place, New York City.

5
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:30,526
His expenses shall be supervised
by Mr. Dwight Babcock...

6
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,144
...acting for
the Knickerbocker Bank...

7
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:35,964
...with the power
to keep my crazy sister...

8
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:40,863
...from doing anything too eccentric
and bringing him up to be like her.

9
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:45,881
Since I am in splendid condition
through workouts at the Brokers Club...

10
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,970
...I am confident that these provisions
won't go into effect for years.

11
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:56,668
I hereby affix my hand this fourteenth
day of September, in the year 1928."

12
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:11,517
You've been reading it for a week.
Why bring it to New York?

13
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,918
It's the only way I can believe it.

14
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:19,231
Besides, your Aunt Mame may like it as
a remembrance of your sainted father.

15
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:24,761
Don't you be going by way of
the North Pole. We're not greenhorns.

16
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:44,474
That's 95 cents.
Here's a dollar. Keep the change.

17
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:07,771
It's like the ladies' restroom
in the Oriental Theater.

18
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,507
You're not scared, are you, Norah?

19
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:22,073
Of course not! And don't you be, child.
Norah's here to look after you.

20
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,753
Saints alive!

21
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:34,838
You want?
Is this the residence of Mame Dennis?

22
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,112
Mame Dennis. Oh, yes!

23
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,476
I'm Norah Muldoon.
I'm bringing Dennis to his aunt.

24
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,770
Oh, you come in. You wait. I fetch.

25
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:47,318
Madam having affair now.

26
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:08,502
Isn't he wonderful?

27
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:24,953
Help is on the way, darlings.

28
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,773
That adorable bootlegger is
on his way with a gallon of gin.

29
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:35,644
Oh, Allen, darling!
Edna, I called you yesterday.

30
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:38,654
Hello, Mame.
I'll be with you in a minute.

31
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:44,980
Vladimir, what are you doing here?
Drinking myself to death, of course.

32
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,517
Besides, I'm your guest of honor.

33
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:52,019
Of course! You must hear
his new symphony, the pastorale.

34
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,018
It has real airplane motors
and live sheep. It's devastating.

35
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,320
You've met our guest of honor,
Vladimir Klinkoff? Miss...

36
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,169
Mrs. Klinkoff.

37
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,332
Yes, of course. Then you've met.
Oh, Perry!

38
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:08,022
Doris, now where are you off to?

39
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:11,255
Everyone's going to Clifton's.
It's nearly 7.

40
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,006
Give Clifton my love.
I'll be right over...

41
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:18,908
Oh, dear. The employment bureau didn't
tell me you were bringing a child.

42
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:23,062
He looks nice. If he misbehaves,
we can toss him in the river.

43
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,295
Please let us escape
from this den of criminals.

44
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:29,974
Doctor, get this woman
on your couch in a hurry!

45
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:34,810
I'm not that kind of a woman.
I'm looking for a Miss Mame Dennis.

46
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:36,631
Ito! lto!
Yes, missy.

47
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:40,375
Show this woman to the kitchen,
start her on glasses.

48
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:45,112
This not dishwashing lady.
Then I must have invited you. A drink?

49
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:50,427
I'm Norah Muldoon. Didn't you get
my telegram saying we'd arrive at 6:00?

50
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:55,859
No, your telegram said October 1.
That's tomorrow. This is September 31.

51
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,746
No, 'tis the first,
curse the evil day.

52
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:03,252
Everybody knows 30 days has
September, April, June and...

53
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:08,658
But, darling, I'm your Auntie Mame!

54
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:14,069
Quiet, everybody. I have an
important announcement to make.

55
00:07:14,237 --> 00:07:19,932
This is my little boy!

56
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:23,704
He's not really my little boy.
He's my late brother's son.

57
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:28,987
My only living relative. That's all we
have, just each other, my little love!

58
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,929
Well, what am I going
to call you, dear?

59
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,222
Pat. Patrick Dennis.
I know the Dennis part.

60
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:40,789
And from now on, you must call me
Auntie Mame. Well, well, well, now.

61
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,864
Would you like a mar...? No.

62
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:46,515
Is it your bedtime? No, it can't be.
The powder room?

63
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:51,985
Food, food! That's it! You must be
famished. Come right along with me.

64
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:59,542
Take your shoes off, darling.
It's like removing your hat in America.

65
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,683
Before sukiyaki,
a little hors d'oeuvre.

66
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,054
Could I try some of that jam?
Jam?

67
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:14,608
That blackberry jam?
Of course.

68
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:19,416
Actually, it's sort of a fishberry jam.
It's called caviar.

69
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:23,769
Now, some pickled octopus,
raw fish tails...

70
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:27,990
It's salty, but I like it.
Good. You have wonderful taste.

71
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:31,249
Vera!

72
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:39,698
Vera, this is my little boy.
Patrick, I want you to meet a star.

73
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:44,176
A great lady of the theater
and my dearest friend, Vera Charles.

74
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,289
Hello!
How do you do?

75
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,972
She just loves little boys.

76
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:55,960
Who's he?
That's a Lithuanian bishop.

77
00:08:56,123 --> 00:09:01,011
Doesn't speak a word of English.
Stimulating man! Oh, Your Grace.

78
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,245
He's a darling and so worldly
for a man of God.

79
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:08,502
Everything in the universe is composed
of the elements of Aristotle.

80
00:09:08,762 --> 00:09:13,332
Thus man is fire, dust and air
mingled with water.

81
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:16,693
Acacius, darling,
this is my nephew Patrick.

82
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,086
This is Mr. Page, dear.

83
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:23,762
That means "Know thyself."
Mr. Page is an educator.

84
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:27,311
He runs a school where
they do advanced things.

85
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:30,164
You think you might
find room for Patrick?

86
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:35,697
For him, yes! In this boy,
I see already the fire, dust and air.

87
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:38,832
Add water and stir.
Would you want to go there?

88
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:42,775
Do they wear uniforms?
At my school, we wear nothing.

89
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:47,060
It's heaven! lt'll stimulate
his psyche and stir up his libido.

90
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:50,290
What's libido?
It's perfectly simple. It...

91
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,660
I'll tell you what we'll do.

92
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:58,003
Every time you hear a word you don't
understand, dear, write it down.

93
00:09:58,169 --> 00:09:59,991
Later, I will explain it.

94
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:04,659
I'm off, Mame.
Lindsay! Lindsay, this is Patrick.

95
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:08,600
Patrick, I want you to meet
Lindsay Woolsey, the publisher.

96
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,917
Circulate, darling. Circulate!
New man in your life?

97
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,928
Little Patrick!
Guess I won't see much of you.

98
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,350
We'll go to the zoo,
the aquarium, the Philharmonic.

99
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,295
We'll be together constantly,
the three of us!

100
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:25,075
That's exactly what I had in mind.

101
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:28,143
Good night, Mame. Thanks.
Watch it, Phyllis.

102
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,614
Some party!
So good of you to come.

103
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:34,038
You played beautifully.
I can't thank you enough.

104
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:37,395
Goodbye, Mrs...

105
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:43,124
Of course.
There you are, my little love.

106
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:46,769
Come here with your Auntie Mame
and sit down a minute.

107
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:50,229
We'll really get to know each other.

108
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:56,243
Well, now, read me all the words
you don't understand.

109
00:10:56,407 --> 00:11:01,295
"Libido, inferiority complex,
stinko, blotto...

110
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:03,983
...free love, bathtub gin...

111
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:08,940
...monkey glands, Karl Marx."
Is he one of the Marx Brothers?

112
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,321
No, dear.

113
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:14,261
She last pretty good tonight.
Marie Antoinette room again?

114
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:17,139
Yes. Perhaps she'll wake up
without a head.

115
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,775
Get that dog of a dress off her.
Me tuck her in.

116
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:25,398
Is the English lady sick?

117
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,925
She's not English.
She's from Pittsburgh.

118
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,218
She sounded English.
She has to do something.

119
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:32,724
Now, where were we?

120
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:36,847
<i>"Narcississistic, Lysissistrata...</i>

121
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:41,357
...cubism, squiffed,
neurotic, heterosexual."

122
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:45,455
My, what an eager mind!
You won't need these words for months.

123
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:49,397
Your vocabulary needs work.
Didn't your father talk to you?

124
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,104
I only saw him at breakfast.
What did he say then?

125
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:57,427
He usually said, "Pipe down, kid.
The old man's hung."

126
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,300
That's succinct.
What did you do in Chicago for fun?

127
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:05,172
Norah took me to the movies
every Saturday afternoon.

128
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:08,815
I played Parcheesi with the doorman,
until he got fired.

129
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:12,780
Didn't they do anything cultural
for you? Well, never mind!

130
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,082
Your Auntie Mame will open doors
for you.

131
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:21,102
Doors you never even dreamed existed.
What times we'll have!

132
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,467
Now, what on earth did I do
with that will?

133
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:29,519
Now, it's here someplace.
Here we are!

134
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:34,736
Now, "Get mahjong lesson, hair done."
That can't be it. Yes, it is it!

135
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,389
Oh, dear. This is a legal document.

136
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,688
A lot of folderol about
the Knickerbocker Bank...

137
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,570
...and some Mr. Babcock,
your trustee...

138
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:49,044
Oh, I see! I have the responsibility
and your trustee has the authority.

139
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:52,139
Norah took me to a movie once
about a trustee.

140
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:56,334
There was a prison break.
A trustee saved the warden's daughter.

141
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,778
This isn't the kind of trustee
that lives in a prison. As a rule.

142
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,283
We'll tackle him
in our own good time.

143
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:07,406
Now, Patrick, is your Auntie Mame
anything like you expected?

144
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:12,526
No. The only picture I saw of you was
with a shawl and a rose in your teeth.

145
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,540
Like a Spanish lady.
It's in my suitcase.

146
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,530
Didn't your father tell you
anything about me before he died?

147
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:23,181
Yes, ma'am.
Well, what was it?

148
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:27,952
Come now, my little love.

149
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:31,793
You must always be frank
with your Auntie Mame.

150
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:36,435
Well, my father said, since you're
my only living relative...

151
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:40,622
...I might be living
with you someday, and...

152
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:42,509
Well?

153
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:49,074
But that to be left in your hands was
a fate he wouldn't wish on a dog.

154
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:51,183
That...

155
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,282
What's that?

156
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:59,242
That is a B. The first letter of a
7-letter word that means your father.

157
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:02,315
Come, child,
I'll show you to your room.

158
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,737
It's a cozy little nook. My loom is
by the window. Do you weave?

159
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:11,372
You can sit at it. I have instructions
from a descendant of Pocahontas.

160
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:15,848
I began with an enormous rug.
It's that bell pull by the fireplace.

161
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:17,928
Your own little den.

162
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:22,987
How stupid of me.
I gave up weaving for sculpture.

163
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,929
That is, a sculptor friend
used this room for six months.

164
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,084
A divine man! Such talented fingers,
but what he did to my bust.

165
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:33,520
That's the head, you know.

166
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:37,231
I guess it's not quite ready yet.

167
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:42,664
The Marie Antoinette room! No, Vera's
there. You better camp out with me.

168
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:46,800
Shall we try this out for size?

169
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:53,360
Perfect! Shall we...?
I'll do it.

170
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:58,279
Sheets. Where were the sheets...?
When will you be home from the party?

171
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,930
What makes you think
I'm going to any party?

172
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,989
Just as I was getting used to
all them dragons. What is it?

173
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,608
Don't ask me. I didn't paint it.
Can I get in her room?

174
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:17,705
At 2:00? You'll be lucky
to get in by 5. She's sleeping.

175
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:20,425
I'll start in the other room.
Can't!

176
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,698
She's sleeping in two bedrooms?

177
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:27,785
No. It's the first lady of American
theater out cold in the guest room.

178
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:30,156
Again? What does she do, live here?

179
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,182
She don't live here. She drinks
and does her passing out here.

180
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:37,199
It's a wonder their blood
hasn't turned to vinegar.

181
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,328
In two weeks,
they've had 13 cocktail parties.

182
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:42,155
Only 13 in two weeks?

183
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:46,728
They had to call one off.
The bootlegger couldn't come that day.

184
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,409
Auntie Mame! Auntie Mame!

185
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:59,430
What is it? What happened?

186
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,529
I've got something to show you.
Look!

187
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,964
Bats!

188
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:10,828
I built it. It has a rubber-band motor.
I built the body out of wood.

189
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:14,702
Please, darling,
your Auntie Mame is hung.

190
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:20,267
Sure, Auntie Mame.

191
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,066
Sure.
Patrick, Patrick, come back.

192
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:28,581
You know, I really am
interested in all your projects.

193
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:32,263
Child, how can you see
with all that light?

194
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,922
That's better. Be an angel
and tell lto to bring me breakfast.

195
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:43,363
Black coffee and a sidecar.
And a cold towel for Auntie Vera.

196
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:48,236
Is she in the guest room again?
Since Sunday. Run along, darling.

197
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:52,424
First, come and give your Auntie Mame
a good morning kiss.

198
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,274
Gently, darling, gently.

199
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,227
That was lovely.
I really am fascinated by aviation.

200
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:04,554
I never knew before
they did it all with rubber bands.

201
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:12,620
Miss Dennis? Yes, she's here.
Who's calling, please?

202
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:15,051
<i>Mr. Babcock.
Hold the wire.</i>

203
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:19,109
It's Mr. Babcock, from the bank.
I've been dodging him for days.

204
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:25,127
Well, hello, Mr. Babcock. How nice
to hear your voice at long last.

205
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:29,091
I too am looking forward
with anticipation to meeting you.

206
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:32,361
The little lad is fine.
He can't wait to meet you.

207
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:35,460
Hurry, my tray, darling!
Auntie needs fuel.

208
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,078
Do drop over anytime, Mr. Babcock.

209
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,739
In how many minutes?

210
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:48,491
Yes, 57th Street is right
in my neck of the woods.

211
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:51,587
Spitting distance?

212
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,231
How vivid. Come right along, then.
You can join me for tea.

213
00:18:56,398 --> 00:19:02,541
That's right, number 3 Beekman Place.
Right away. Vera! Vera!

214
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:08,712
Vera! Vera! I am about to be attacked
by the Knickerbocker Bank.

215
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,200
That's lovely.
Vera!

216
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:16,804
Why'd that Oriental sandman
let me sleep in my best Chanel?

217
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:18,827
He tried but you bit him.

218
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:21,672
Patrick's trustee,
some hideous man...

219
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:26,592
...is about to descend upon me
like a vulture and rob me of my child.

220
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:29,928
He's coming here?
In the middle of the night?

221
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:33,125
That moon's bright!

222
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:37,154
Stop being silly. I have got
to make the right impression!

223
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:42,180
The Knickerbocker Bank is so
conservative, they don't pay interest.

224
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:47,912
All right! Let's get organized.
What time is it, and what day is it?

225
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:50,465
I was due at the theater guild.

226
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:54,149
You can't desert me in my predicament.
What will I wear?

227
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:58,178
How can I face the guild?
Will this make me look Scarsdale?

228
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:02,855
Have you ever been to Scarsdale?
Good afternoon, Aunt Vera.

229
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,216
Do Lillian Gish.
Simple dress, Madonna-like hairdo.

230
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,853
Madonna-like hairdo. That's it.
A switch! A switch!

231
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,125
You got one?
Dozens.

232
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:17,416
Do you throw anything away?
I may go back to one of these colors.

233
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,112
lf you kept your hair natural as l...
I'd be bald! Pick one close to mine.

234
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:29,059
Try this. You need a dress like I wore
as Lady... That's stunning!

235
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,945
It's my new dress.
I haven't had it on yet.

236
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:36,069
I won't put $500 on my back
for that awful man. A suit will do.

237
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,585
Hold it so I can braid it like a halo.
I've got to go.

238
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:44,011
I can't let him see you. He'll think
I run a house for wanton women.

239
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:47,271
I'll wear your mink.
Over my dead body!

240
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:49,541
This dress is heaven.

241
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,495
You know, green suits me.
I think I'll phone up Maggie.

242
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,862
Put this on my head. Hurry!
No matter how it looks.

243
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:00,579
I've got to go.
Don't you dare leave me!

244
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:05,929
You could care less about my career...
Not already! Norah, lto, the door!

245
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,905
I've gotta get out before he gets in.

246
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,745
I can't leave him down in the foyer!

247
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:13,540
That's the third time!

248
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:17,600
Be my friend for five minutes.
I've been a friend!

249
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,585
Go down and make
Mr. Babcock feel at home.

250
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,502
But the theater guild!

251
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:27,074
Get out of my way! What am I gonna
do with this damn stinking halo?

252
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:38,786
You want?

253
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:42,369
I'm Mr. Babcock.
Miss Dennis is expecting me.

254
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,956
You come in.
Thank you.

255
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:49,383
I take coat?
Thank you. Thank you.

256
00:21:55,658 --> 00:21:58,527
You sit.
Thank you.

257
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:05,032
Mr. Babcock? We've been expecting you.
My name is Patrick Dennis.

258
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,489
Please sit down.
Fine. Fine.

259
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,869
Auntie Mame will be right down.

260
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:24,383
She's having a little trouble
with her halo.

261
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,363
She'll be right down.

262
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:37,121
You look like a bully little chap.

263
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:39,841
Yes, sir, a bully little chap.

264
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:44,132
You look very bully too.
Yes.

265
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:50,276
Would you care
for a martini, Mr. Babcock?

266
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,633
Dry or extra dry?

267
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:59,650
Sit down, please. I'll make them
like I do for Mr. Woolcott.

268
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:21,730
Stir, never shake. Bruises the gin.

269
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,297
Would you care for an olive?

270
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:52,286
Auntie Mame says olives take up
too much room in such a little glass.

271
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,822
Why, Mr. Babcock!

272
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,694
What an honor it is
to have you in our little home.

273
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:07,646
I wonder if it makes the best first
impression on a sensitive young mind...

274
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:10,748
...to see you drinking
during business hours.

275
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:14,366
But he...
I won't breathe a word to the bank.

276
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:17,381
Just one minute.
Where did he learn to mix...?

277
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,706
Mr. Babcock, knowledge is power.

278
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,467
That is exactly what I'm here for.
To discuss this boy's proper education.

279
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,517
Nuts?

280
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:32,031
No, thank you.
Won't you sit down?

281
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:36,868
He won't have to worry about his
future. His money is in steady bonds.

282
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:42,267
You'll agree that it's time he be
enrolled in an institution of learning.

283
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:45,885
I'm already enrolled in...
Let Mr. Babcock talk.

284
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:51,488
I've gone to pains to gather information
on some better boys' schools in town.

285
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:54,916
I prefer coeducational schools.
What do you mean?

286
00:24:55,078 --> 00:25:00,064
Coeducational means when boys
and girls go to school together.

287
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,874
First, the Bixby School
which is known to be splendid.

288
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,235
Have you considered a school
run by Acacius Page?

289
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:09,951
It follows ancient Greek principles...

290
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:14,874
Your brother's will was most specific.
Conservative schooling, he said.

291
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,079
There's my alma mater,
St. Boniface in Massachusetts.

292
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:19,522
It's too far.

293
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,555
You'd better settle
on the Browning School.

294
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:28,323
It is known to be conservative
and this gives the boys basic...

295
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:36,453
That's enough candy, dear.
Sorry.

296
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:40,804
Not you, Mr. Babcock.
You can have all you want.

297
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:44,378
Have you thought of
the Dillman School? It's here...

298
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,089
Too experimental. You wanna keep
the riffraff out of the boy's life.

299
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:52,568
The school must be exclusive
and restricted.

300
00:25:52,963 --> 00:25:56,575
Exclusively what
and restricted to whom?

301
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,093
We must spare the boy
certain influences...

302
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,740
...from the wrong side of the tracks,
shall we say?

303
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,710
Mr. Babbitt...
Babcock.

304
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:12,382
Yes. It was very good of you to come.
What school will it be?

305
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:16,094
Name the school, and Patrick
and I will know what to do.

306
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:19,675
I'd say Bixby.
Then bully for Bixby.

307
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:23,422
I'll make out a check to Bixby School.
You register him.

308
00:26:23,588 --> 00:26:26,009
Whatever you say.

309
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,027
I say I'm very happy to have met you.

310
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:33,595
After the reports I'd heard,
I was prejudiced, and not in your favor.

311
00:26:33,764 --> 00:26:38,652
But I find you a woman
with a very powerful charm.

312
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,010
And you're a man
with a very powerful bank.

313
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:47,678
Floor all scrubbed.
Clean just like old country.

314
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:51,226
I go now. Get lamb chops,
bottle of milk for boy.

315
00:26:51,396 --> 00:26:53,567
Pick up my coat!
Bye, Aunt Vera!

316
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:55,674
Bye, kid!

317
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:44,856
Don't drop anything. What a marvelous
day! October's bright, blue weather.

318
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:48,986
All we've seen was the store.
Haven't even called my office.

319
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:52,121
Oh, stop complaining, Lindsay.

320
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:55,263
When are we going
to have time to ourselves?

321
00:27:55,425 --> 00:28:01,142
I've had to make up Patrick's 10
neglected years in a matter of months.

322
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:03,386
Dr. Spock says it's impossible.

323
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:06,870
Does Dr. Spock mention
that a child needs a father?

324
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:10,141
There are a lot of women
who think I'm attractive.

325
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:14,561
Don't start that! How can I be a wife?
I'm too busy being a mother.

326
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:20,535
Oh, I forgot. One moment!
Thank you.

327
00:28:20,705 --> 00:28:23,869
My hat! Thank you.

328
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:29,467
I hope Patrick likes the chemistry set,
the books, the atlas, the Kipling.

329
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,699
I don't like your latest fad.
Fad? Patrick?

330
00:28:32,865 --> 00:28:36,477
I've seen you through yogi,
sculpture, dance and foods.

331
00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:40,471
You take each as if nothing else
existed. Then you drop them.

332
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:43,293
You think he's a temporary enthusiasm?

333
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:47,833
It's called "molding a new life."
You've been in some mood.

334
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:52,736
You deceitful, irresponsible bohemian!
Whatever do you mean?

335
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,378
You're not fit to raise a child!
Something's happened?

336
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:58,007
Come here, you heathen!

337
00:28:58,177 --> 00:29:00,566
What's wrong?
He came to my school...

338
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:04,698
I dropped by the Bixby School
and what did I find?

339
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:07,232
I find he isn't even registered!

340
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:10,239
I hunted through
every low, crackpot school.

341
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,229
I found him in the lowest of them.
Mr. Page is progressive.

342
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,766
There they were!
A room full of them!

343
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:22,491
Boys, girls, teachers, romping around
naked, bare as the day they were born.

344
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:27,325
The children were engaged in
normal, healthful, broadening pursuits.

345
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:31,317
Broadening? Show them what
you were doing when I broke in.

346
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:35,448
We were playing fish families.
It's part of constructive play.

347
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:37,371
Listen to this.
Show me.

348
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:39,771
We do it right after yogurt time.

349
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:44,059
Mrs. Page and all the girls
crouch down under the sun lamps...

350
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:48,380
...pretending to be lady fishes
depositing their eggs in the sand.

351
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:52,984
Then Mr. Page and all the boys
do what gentlemen fish do.

352
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:55,933
What could be more wholesome
or natural?

353
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,673
Natural? Well, it might
be natural for a sardine!

354
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:03,831
Mr. Babcock, I consider
your behavior most undignified.

355
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:06,584
Undignified? At least I wear a vest.

356
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:11,541
Making a scene. Causing
a traumatic experience for this child.

357
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:16,119
I know how you twist things around.
I'm getting out of this nudist camp...

358
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:19,866
...before you make me look
like the president of free love.

359
00:30:20,064 --> 00:30:24,603
Mr. Babcock,
not in front of the B-O-Y.

360
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:30,302
Tomorrow morning I'm taking
this kid off to boarding school.

361
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,277
I am placing him
in St. Boniface Academy.

362
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:36,438
You'll only get him
Christmas and summer.

363
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,055
I wish I could stop you from that!
Do I have to?

364
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:44,730
Please, I'll do whatever you say.
Not on your life! He goes tomorrow.

365
00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:48,889
Let's be reasonable.
I'll make him a decent Christian...

366
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,093
...if I have to break his bones.

367
00:30:51,261 --> 00:30:52,854
Give me another chance.

368
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:57,112
I wouldn't give you the time
after the double-cross you pulled.

369
00:30:57,277 --> 00:30:59,448
But he's all that I have!

370
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:05,657
Have him ready at 8:00 sharp tomorrow.
Kid, you'd better be wearing knickers!

371
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:15,158
I want to stay with you, Auntie Mame.
I don't want go to St. Bony-face.

372
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,587
Now, hush.

373
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:20,440
Hush, my little love.

374
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:27,734
I'm sure St. Boniface
is really very nice.

375
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:33,685
You go upstairs now, dear...

376
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,439
...and get ready for dinner.

377
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:39,321
We'll talk about it later.

378
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,604
Lindsay.

379
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:03,893
Lindsay, what am I going to do?

380
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:07,638
Mame, I'm sorry.

381
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:09,692
Well, I...

382
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:15,444
I just don't think I can bear it.

383
00:32:16,445 --> 00:32:18,681
I just don't.

384
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:22,740
Mame.

385
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,069
I've never seen you cry before.

386
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:27,993
Mame!

387
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:32,371
Mame, are you home?
Is that you, Vera?

388
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:34,841
What on earth does she want?

389
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:38,963
Have you talked to your stockbroker?
Yes, I can see you have.

390
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:43,801
What about her stockbroker?
He's trying to locate both of you.

391
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,883
What happened?
Nothing.

392
00:32:46,075 --> 00:32:49,687
Except nothing's worth
anything anymore.

393
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:53,910
Hello.
Now, don't you worry.

394
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:58,614
It can't affect us. We own solid stuff
like Bank of the United States.

395
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:03,993
Missy Dennis, stockbroker want to say
hello before he jump out of window.

396
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,089
How bad is it, Arthur?
Not Bank of the United States.

397
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:14,583
Atwater Kent too?

398
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:20,625
Mame, I'm afraid you're wiped out.
We all are.

399
00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:24,340
Everyone said I was a fool
spending all my money at Tiffany's.

400
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,322
Who cares about money?
I've lost my child.

401
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:30,549
What?
Patrick's trustee is sending him away.

402
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:33,366
Oh, Mame, darling.

403
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:36,825
I know how you must feel.

404
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:41,207
Do you?
Well, of course I do.

405
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:45,048
I never had a child,
but I'm an actress. I can imagine.

406
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:47,447
There must be something I can do.

407
00:33:47,643 --> 00:33:53,044
I've got it! The perfect solution.
It'll solve everything. You'll work.

408
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,545
Work?
You'll return to the stage...

409
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:59,417
<i>...in my play, Midsummer Madness.
There are dozens of parts.</i>

410
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:02,775
We open Thanksgiving in New Haven.
I'll call Max.

411
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:06,616
Do you think I could?
Of course you could. Couldn't she?

412
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,145
You'll have to work at something.

413
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:12,917
The only chance to get Patrick back
is to show Babcock...

414
00:34:13,113 --> 00:34:16,277
...that you've settled down
into something steady.

415
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:20,183
Or to earn money to fight him with.
You're so right!

416
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:24,271
About $500 a week to start.
It'll be a bit in the last act.

417
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:27,156
Then there'll be a raise. I accept!

418
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:31,990
Your heart is from Tiffany's too.
It'll be like old times...

419
00:34:32,185 --> 00:34:36,408
<i>...when we were trooping together
in Chu Chin Girl. I can't wait!</i>

420
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:38,772
This is a serious drama.

421
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:41,336
I was in front. Vera was behind me.

422
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:44,050
If I'd been behind you,
I'd have kicked...

423
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,999
I know exactly what I did.
It used to go:

424
00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:59,791
That's it!

425
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:50,038
An appalling situation.
Frightful, my dear.

426
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,922
Where's Miss Dennis?

427
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,632
Keep your shirt on!
She's still making up.

428
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:59,760
She has a lousy two-line bit.
She's had two acts to make up.

429
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,702
Make sure she knows her entrance
is from the other side.

430
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,987
But in all fairness to him,
I believe she's been leading him on.

431
00:36:08,183 --> 00:36:12,177
After all, she is a princess.
He, a commoner.

432
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:16,336
Everybody into the solarium.
I think I hear them coming now.

433
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:19,382
But, Reginald, to do such a thing!

434
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:23,055
To dash away together like this
would be mad.

435
00:36:23,255 --> 00:36:27,248
Quite devastatingly mad.

436
00:36:28,663 --> 00:36:32,045
Quite devastatingly mad.

437
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,452
Lord Dudley, your flattery would turn
a young girl's head.

438
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:42,477
Come now. Hurry to the ball.
If we tarry, we shall be late.

439
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,045
No, it would be madness.

440
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:53,550
I belong to one world, you to another.
It's better we part now.

441
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:57,745
Now, while we cherish
this ecstasy we've known.

442
00:36:57,943 --> 00:37:00,561
What have you got back there,
reindeer?

443
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:05,396
This is goodbye, Reginald.
I hear the others coming.

444
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:14,259
Lord Dudley, no more champagne
or I shall forget myself altogether.

445
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:18,350
I have... I have...
I must say, you're the funniest man.

446
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:20,722
I have something to tell you!

447
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:24,268
I have been unexpectedly
called back home.

448
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:29,075
Prince Alex needs me
and my place is by his side.

449
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:32,466
It has been so lovely
this whole summer.

450
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:38,575
But after all, it has only been
midsummer madness.

451
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:44,042
Lady Iris, would you be good enough
to ring for my wrap?

452
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:47,059
Certainly, princess.

453
00:37:48,757 --> 00:37:52,881
And get rid of those damn cowbells!

454
00:37:54,037 --> 00:37:59,569
May I help you, princess?
Thank you, Lady Iris.

455
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,024
Goodbye, goodbye.

456
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:12,142
I shall always feel
a strong attachment to you all.

457
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:14,414
Let go!
I can't. I'm stuck.

458
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:16,620
Let go!

459
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:23,090
It's my bracelet. It's caught on you.
Bring down the curtain!

460
00:38:27,413 --> 00:38:28,493
I was only...

461
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:32,687
Ruining my beautiful play
with your lousy bell ringing!

462
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:39,025
These are the only bracelets
I have in the world.

463
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:43,156
Enough! That's enough!

464
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:03,146
Okay, strike the set!
Why?

465
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:08,084
I thought I'd give her character.
You scene-stealing, society biddy!

466
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:11,570
You destroyed me!
There were critics out there!

467
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:13,040
We're all ruined!

468
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:18,766
Don't let me catch the sight of
your evil face again, you assassin!

469
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:21,713
But, Vera... You see...

470
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,973
I felt if I should make
something out of...

471
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:27,724
There weren't
many lines, and I felt...

472
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:33,962
Ms. Charles asked...

473
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:21,385
I thought you were very good,
Auntie Mame. Everybody noticed you.

474
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:25,864
My little love.
How did you get up to New Haven?

475
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:28,042
lto brought me up.

476
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,829
How could lto drive you up?
I sold the car.

477
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,061
He didn't drive. We hitchhiked.

478
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,626
Mr. Babcock thinks you're in school.

479
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:41,521
It's all right.
It's Thanksgiving vacation.

480
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:44,072
Is it?

481
00:40:46,419 --> 00:40:51,687
Can I be your escort?
Can I take you back to your hotel?

482
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:59,149
You can take me all the way
back to New York.

483
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:02,826
Patrick.

484
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,342
Oh, Patrick.

485
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:10,128
Are you ashamed of your Auntie Mame?

486
00:41:10,865 --> 00:41:12,839
I'm proud of you!

487
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:17,678
Nobody liked the stinky old play
at all until you came in.

488
00:41:31,153 --> 00:41:33,422
Lady Iris?

489
00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:41,097
Charmed...

490
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:44,301
...Lord Dudley.

491
00:42:17,713 --> 00:42:20,200
Widdicombe, Gutterman,
Applewhite, Bibberman and Black.

492
00:42:20,368 --> 00:42:24,110
You want to talk to Mr. Gutterman?
I'll connect you.

493
00:42:24,272 --> 00:42:27,621
Widdicombe, Gutterman,
Applewhite, Bibberman and Black.

494
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:32,199
Yes, Mr. Bibberman. You'd like to talk
to Mr. Applewhite. I'll connect you.

495
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:39,656
Yes, long distance, how are you?

496
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:44,078
Mr. Widdicombe, I have
your San Francisco call for you.

497
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,442
Yes, Mr. Bibberman?

498
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:52,494
Did I connect you with Mr. Gutterman
instead of Mr. Applewhite? I'm sorry.

499
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:56,364
What are you doing in that hole
with Mr. Gutterman?

500
00:42:56,558 --> 00:42:58,053
Yes, Mr. Widdicombe?

501
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:01,386
I'll try to reconnect you again
with San Francisco.

502
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:05,707
Let me see, Mr. Bibberman is in there.
Where is Mr. Applewhite?

503
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:10,889
There you are, Mr. Applewhite!
There's no such place as San Francisco.

504
00:43:11,087 --> 00:43:13,029
Please!

505
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:47,243
Roller-skate lady.
Where is the roller-skate lady?

506
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:50,189
That stupid clerk sent me
two left skates.

507
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:53,515
Does Macy think my son
has two left feet?

508
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,730
If you'll just be patient, madam.
Where is the roller-skate lady?

509
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:03,117
I don't know how I got in Tinkertoys.
I want a pair of skates.

510
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:05,961
One moment. Oh, Mr. Loomis!

511
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,006
Will you help me with my sales slip?

512
00:44:09,198 --> 00:44:12,131
Why don't you let me
send these COD?

513
00:44:12,332 --> 00:44:15,431
Then you wouldn't have to pay.
I would eventually.

514
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:19,426
Of course, but why worry about it now?

515
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:23,524
Now, here's your slip.
It's so simple.

516
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:29,441
No big, bulky bundles to carry or lose
en route, as it were. I love COD.

517
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:35,274
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.
Just one moment, please. Yes?

518
00:44:35,436 --> 00:44:37,575
Yes?

519
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,570
Can you assist me in ordering
24 pair of those roller skates?

520
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,854
Twenty-four pair!
My, what a proud father you must be.

521
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:48,646
I'm a single gentleman.

522
00:44:48,845 --> 00:44:51,812
But there are tykes
at Oglethorpe Orphanage...

523
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,566
...that will be happy
to see that package.

524
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:57,547
That's a nice thing to do.
It's the true...

525
00:44:57,741 --> 00:45:00,392
How much does that come to,
little lady?

526
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:03,109
You want to pay? Cash?

527
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,862
Just Oglethorpe Orphanage,
Georgia.

528
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,995
Wouldn't you prefer
if I sent them COD?

529
00:45:09,197 --> 00:45:12,906
The nippers wouldn't think
much of their Santa Claus...

530
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:17,607
...if he filled their stockings
with bills for collection on delivery.

531
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:21,572
I haven't worked here long.

532
00:45:21,772 --> 00:45:25,667
The only kind of sales slip
I know how to make out is COD.

533
00:45:25,868 --> 00:45:28,138
I might be of assistance here.

534
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:33,034
We'd get in a lot of trouble.
I'm familiar with financial matters.

535
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:37,157
First, get your duplicates
and triplicates straightened out.

536
00:45:37,357 --> 00:45:41,001
Mr. Macy wouldn't have any way
of knowing what you sold.

537
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:45,059
That's why they have tissue paper!
A nice, new order blank.

538
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,635
First name:

539
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,421
Beauregard...

540
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,815
...Jackson Pickett Burnside.

541
00:45:52,011 --> 00:45:54,793
That's a lot.
You took up all that space.

542
00:45:54,987 --> 00:45:58,085
Ms. Dennis! May I inquire
what is going on here?

543
00:45:58,282 --> 00:46:02,919
He was helping me with the slip.
This young lady, Ms. Dennis...

544
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:07,719
...was having trouble with the sales
slip for skates. I was helping her.

545
00:46:07,915 --> 00:46:11,711
Was there something unusual?
Yes, he wanted to pay cash.

546
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:15,265
A Macy employee doesn't know
how to make a cash sale?

547
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:18,020
I'm a whiz at CODs.
You can tell.

548
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:22,725
Ms. Dennis, this sales book
is a shambles!

549
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:25,572
Goodbye, everybody,
and Merry Christmas.

550
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,639
That young lady was doing
the best she knew!

551
00:46:28,843 --> 00:46:31,592
I consider myself
responsible for this!

552
00:46:31,786 --> 00:46:33,925
The thing is a misunderstanding.

553
00:46:34,122 --> 00:46:37,439
Don't forget the skates
for the little nippers!

554
00:46:37,642 --> 00:46:40,609
Get them at Gimbels!

555
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,575
I'm not finished decorating yet.
You're home early.

556
00:47:48,777 --> 00:47:52,868
They gave me my Christmas
vacation a little bit early.

557
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:56,229
I'm glad, because now
it fits with your vacation.

558
00:47:56,424 --> 00:48:00,963
We won't miss even a day together.
Patrick, that's beautiful.

559
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:06,114
A genuine Picasso, huh?
His black and blue period.

560
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:15,552
It's almost a week till Christmas.

561
00:48:16,136 --> 00:48:17,991
But open it.

562
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:21,022
Patrick, where did you get the money?

563
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:23,942
Mr. Leavitt down at the pawnshop...

564
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:28,381
...gave me a good price for
my hockey stick and microscope.

565
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:32,708
I was getting tired of microbes.
Now, you know you...

566
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:36,647
My, my, my, my.
They're not quite diamonds.

567
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:43,235
Oh, darling, that's the most beautiful
bracelet I ever owned.

568
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,822
Wiggle it.

569
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:54,784
See, it doesn't make any noise.

570
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:00,704
I told the man you had to have
a quiet one for when you go on-stage.

571
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:05,160
Wear it with your mink coat.
You'll make a sensation at Macy's.

572
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:08,167
I've already made
a sensation at Macy's.

573
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,100
My mink coat is down at Mr. Leavitt's
with your microscope.

574
00:49:12,262 --> 00:49:16,124
If we're going to have Christmas,
let's have it all around.

575
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:19,523
Norah, lto! Come in, please!

576
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,317
Yes, Missy Dennis?

577
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:28,574
Merry Christmas, everyone!
It isn't till Tuesday.

578
00:49:28,742 --> 00:49:31,939
We need it now,
so let's go ahead and have it.

579
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:37,766
Norah, lto, Patrick. I did want to pay
you some of your back salary...

580
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:41,854
Not another word about it.
We wouldn't think of leaving you.

581
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:45,121
No place else get job anyhow.

582
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:51,260
It isn't 17 jewels, but time isn't
worth all that decoration these days.

583
00:49:51,462 --> 00:49:52,672
Thank you.

584
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:56,318
So French-smelling, I feel
as alluring as Theda Bara.

585
00:49:56,518 --> 00:50:00,347
Golly, long pants at last!
Can I try them on right now?

586
00:50:00,518 --> 00:50:03,201
Right now!

587
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:08,577
Well, we've got a little present
for you too, lto and me.

588
00:50:08,774 --> 00:50:12,931
I hope you're not going to be angry.
What is it?

589
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,693
lto had money put by and so did I,
for a rainy day, you might say.

590
00:50:17,862 --> 00:50:22,401
We both figure it couldn't get much
wetter than it is right now.

591
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:28,517
We pay grocery and butcher bill.
Now Mr. Schultz no give nasty look.

592
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,145
You're both so dear to me.

593
00:50:41,894 --> 00:50:44,480
I'll pay you back one day.

594
00:50:46,662 --> 00:50:48,931
You know I will...

595
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:52,643
...if ever I can.

596
00:51:00,773 --> 00:51:05,148
You're a loving woman.
You're odd, but you're loving.

597
00:51:05,348 --> 00:51:07,770
We wish that
you could find a man...

598
00:51:07,972 --> 00:51:13,155
...as wonderful and as fine
a gentleman as you are a fine lady.

599
00:51:13,861 --> 00:51:17,690
What happened to Mr. Lindsay Woolsey?
He was a nice man.

600
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:21,405
Yes, he was a nice man,
but I sent him away.

601
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:25,663
I said no when I had money.
I couldn't say yes when I went broke.

602
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,715
Look!

603
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,876
Besides, I have my own
fine gentleman, Norah...

604
00:51:31,076 --> 00:51:35,037
...who gives me diamonds
or almost diamonds.

605
00:51:35,236 --> 00:51:40,451
What we need is some music.
Some Christmas carols!

606
00:52:11,332 --> 00:52:13,852
Patrick, go to her.

607
00:52:19,364 --> 00:52:23,106
Don't cry, Auntie Mame.
Please don't cry.

608
00:52:24,324 --> 00:52:27,553
Hell, we don't even have any Kleenex.

609
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:34,710
If that's Santa Claus,
tell him we've already had it.

610
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:39,585
Howdy. Excuse me,
but I wondered if...

611
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,730
I declare, it's a miracle.

612
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:48,313
That's what it is.
It's a Christmas miracle.

613
00:52:48,514 --> 00:52:53,980
You've got no idea how happy I am.
I've been looking all over for you.

614
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:58,401
Do you realize there are 97 Dennises
in the Manhattan directory?

615
00:52:58,594 --> 00:53:01,594
I was just about ready
to sail for Brooklyn.

616
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:03,998
Tell me why you came here.

617
00:53:04,194 --> 00:53:07,675
I went back to apologize to you,
but you was gone.

618
00:53:07,874 --> 00:53:10,809
I told them Macy folks
that they was wrong.

619
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:14,459
Why, a woman of your culture
and charm and refinement...

620
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,179
...should have
an executive position...

621
00:53:17,346 --> 00:53:21,983
...with a lot of hard hands to wrestle
with them pesky writing details.

622
00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:23,836
Would you excuse me?

623
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:27,231
I want to pay off that taxi man,
so he can get home.

624
00:53:27,394 --> 00:53:31,323
You left the taxi meter running
in the middle of the Depression?

625
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,432
Well, ma'am, I'm in oil.

626
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:37,857
It just keeps on gushing
and not much I can do about it.

627
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:42,971
I'm all alone here and if you wouldn't
consider me too presumptuous...

628
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:45,855
...l'd be honored
to squire you to dinner.

629
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:50,974
No, thank you. We're celebrating.
I can't leave my little family.

630
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:54,486
I can understand that.
I'm knee-deep in family.

631
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,788
You ought to come to Georgia
and meet them all.

632
00:53:57,986 --> 00:54:01,947
I think you'd just love Peckerwood.
Who's Peckerwood?

633
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:06,237
No, ma'am. That's the name
of my little old plantation.

634
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:10,971
Maybe, just for tonight, I could
be part of your little old family?

635
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:14,364
And we'd have dinner together.
I'm not dressed.

636
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,342
You look fine.
You don't need to worry.

637
00:54:17,536 --> 00:54:20,056
A little powder and you'll look...

638
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:26,558
Just fine.

639
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:33,398
Look here, I'll tell
that nice taxi man to wait.

640
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:36,884
Marry him the minute he asks you!

641
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:38,811
What's his name?

642
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:41,146
You don't know his name.
I do.

643
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:46,461
We are about to break bread with
Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside.

644
00:54:46,656 --> 00:54:49,918
Get your coat.
Ito, change your jacket. Now, hurry!

645
00:54:50,304 --> 00:54:53,882
And you'd better bring your scarf,
it's cold outside.

646
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,211
Norah, don't forget
to take your apron off.

647
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:03,038
Ito, hurry!

648
00:55:06,656 --> 00:55:09,176
I was going to give you this
at dinner.

649
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:13,566
Norah, you're an angel.
There must be one for you too.

650
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,502
Me never believe in Santa.
Me beginning to change mind.

651
00:55:17,696 --> 00:55:21,373
I never did think Santa
would have a Southern accent!

652
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,655
<i>Merry Christmas from
Manny, Moe and Jack.</i>

653
00:55:26,848 --> 00:55:32,085
Merry Christmas to y'all, Manny, Moe
and Jack. And a Happy New Year!

654
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,828
Good morning.

655
00:55:44,032 --> 00:55:47,676
Where's my snuffbox?
What son of a dog stole my snuffbox?

656
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,042
It's in your lap, Mother Burnside.

657
00:55:50,237 --> 00:55:53,434
Where is she?
I don't see any New York filly here.

658
00:55:53,598 --> 00:55:56,118
Just the same old family
standing around...

659
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,904
...waiting to be mentioned in my will.

660
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:03,100
Afternoon to y'all. Vultures!
Good afternoon.

661
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:06,610
Now, Ms. Burnside,
that doesn't include me, does it?

662
00:56:06,782 --> 00:56:12,248
No, Sally Cato, you ain't no vulture.
You're just a dead pigeon.

663
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:20,406
I can't see how you got
Beauregard out of your nest.

664
00:56:20,574 --> 00:56:22,396
You should've sat on him.

665
00:56:22,558 --> 00:56:26,333
Son? We got our sweet
Georgia peaches right here.

666
00:56:26,526 --> 00:56:30,552
Don't know why you had to go
and bring back a Northern lemon.

667
00:56:30,718 --> 00:56:33,816
Let's keep our grits going
in the right direction.

668
00:56:34,238 --> 00:56:38,199
My Auntie Mame, Miss Dennis,
says she'll be here in a moment.

669
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:42,292
Well, now, what a lovable,
genteel little gentleman!

670
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:45,048
You and my brother
are gonna get along...

671
00:56:45,246 --> 00:56:48,824
...like a pair of colts in a pasture,
I can just tell.

672
00:56:49,022 --> 00:56:50,451
Emory!

673
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:54,843
Your sister's nice.
Nice?

674
00:56:55,038 --> 00:57:00,253
You're plumb crazy. She's the meanest
damn filly in the entire South.

675
00:57:00,414 --> 00:57:03,262
Mame, where are you?
We're all waiting on you.

676
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,552
I'm coming, Beau, sugar.
There we are, honey.

677
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:11,157
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm just busting to meet your mother.

678
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:17,497
Mother, dear, I'd like
to present Miss Mame Dennis.

679
00:57:18,846 --> 00:57:20,253
Well, I...

680
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:25,781
I must say, Mrs. Burnside,
you're everything I ever expected.

681
00:57:26,237 --> 00:57:30,065
And quite more.
And these here are my...

682
00:57:32,764 --> 00:57:34,040
Bless you.

683
00:57:34,396 --> 00:57:38,673
These are the rest of my kin.
The Jacksons, Picketts, Burnsides.

684
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:40,981
This is Sally Cato MacDougal.

685
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,239
Stay out here and have a nice chat.
I'm gonna fix you a drink.

686
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:50,072
And then we're gonna run along down
and I'll have you meet my horses.

687
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,587
Well, I...

688
00:57:55,387 --> 00:58:00,209
I can't tell you how charming
it is to meet all of...

689
00:58:00,668 --> 00:58:02,129
...you all.

690
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,235
Tell me, Miss Dennis...
May I call you "Mame"?

691
00:58:05,404 --> 00:58:07,989
Please do.
And you call me Sally Cato.

692
00:58:08,156 --> 00:58:09,683
Thank you.
Tell me...

693
00:58:09,884 --> 00:58:14,772
...was it horses brought you
and Beauregard together?

694
00:58:14,939 --> 00:58:17,787
A horse is the most important
thing in his life.

695
00:58:17,979 --> 00:58:23,576
I love riding. In New York, hardly a
day goes by, I don't have boots on.

696
00:58:23,772 --> 00:58:27,384
Up every morning at dawn
for a ride through Central Park.

697
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:31,289
That settles it. In your honor,
we've got to have a hunt.

698
00:58:31,452 --> 00:58:33,907
A hunt? Oh, a hunt. A hunt?!

699
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:37,403
Everybody, Beauregard's gone
and surprised us all!

700
00:58:37,596 --> 00:58:42,647
She's a prominent Northern horsewoman.
Naturally, we've got to have a hunt.

701
00:58:42,843 --> 00:58:45,942
Dawn, tomorrow morning.
Everybody's invited!

702
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,595
Won't we have a lark?
The sun up...

703
00:58:48,795 --> 00:58:54,960
...leaping over hedges, jumping over
river gaps and the hounds yapping!

704
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:58,644
Every eye in this county
will be on you tomorrow.

705
00:58:58,844 --> 00:59:01,594
I didn't bring any of my riding togs.

706
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:04,886
Don't worry, I got dozens
of things you can wear.

707
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:07,222
What's your shoe size?
3B.

708
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:13,081
That's marvelous! Same as I wear.
You do ride astride, Mame, dear?

709
00:59:13,242 --> 00:59:17,879
No, sidesaddle. Daddy,
the colonel, insisted that I learn it.

710
00:59:18,074 --> 00:59:23,508
He said it was the only way for a lady
to ride, so graceful. Silly of him.

711
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:27,600
Nobody rides sidesaddle now,
but it's the only way I know.

712
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:29,973
Now, isn't that just grand?

713
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:34,196
I just happen to have a little
sidesaddle that'll do you fine.

714
00:59:34,394 --> 00:59:36,281
Refreshments?
Beau, darling...

715
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:40,882
...we're having a hunt. Your sweet
Yankee girl is riding sidesaddle!

716
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:45,686
I won't permit it. It's too dangerous!
But, darling, she's insisted.

717
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:50,355
Well, anything that Mame says
she can do, she can do.

718
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:53,172
I tell you, she's an amazing woman.

719
00:59:53,369 --> 00:59:54,863
Mame, sugar...

720
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:59,954
...l'm just gonna hold my breath
until dawn tomorrow.

721
01:00:00,249 --> 01:00:02,388
Do that, honey.

722
01:00:08,473 --> 01:00:12,401
Stop looking at the pictures.
Read it to me, I'm listening.

723
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:14,325
"How to Ride a Horse."

724
01:00:14,522 --> 01:00:18,231
It says, "Always get on the horse
from the left side."

725
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:23,160
My left side or the horse's left side?
It doesn't say. Listen to this.

726
01:00:23,354 --> 01:00:26,004
"Whenever approaching
a strange mount...

727
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:29,518
...fix the animal in the eye
with a masterful gaze.

728
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:33,618
Remain calm, for a horse has
a highly developed sense of smell...

729
01:00:33,785 --> 01:00:36,785
...and can react dangerously
when he smells fear."

730
01:00:36,954 --> 01:00:38,677
I hope he likes Chanel No. 5.

731
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:42,038
I didn't know this.
"Horses aren't native to America."

732
01:00:42,202 --> 01:00:45,780
Read me something useful.
I'm about to go over the top.

733
01:00:45,977 --> 01:00:49,872
Clearing fences.
It says you should always lean.

734
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:53,552
Jumping water hazards.
"Don't lean. Sit erect."

735
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,435
Don't lean. Sit erect.
Say your prayers.

736
01:00:56,631 --> 01:01:00,428
Be good to Norah and lto
after I'm gone.

737
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:05,871
I think Sally left a foot in this one.

738
01:01:06,071 --> 01:01:09,649
Let me help you.
No, darling. It's no use.

739
01:01:10,392 --> 01:01:13,109
Why are you going through all this?

740
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:17,973
If I can snag you an Uncle Beau,
all our problems will be solved.

741
01:01:18,168 --> 01:01:22,575
Besides, there's another minor,
relatively unimportant thing:

742
01:01:22,776 --> 01:01:25,329
I happen to be in love with him.

743
01:01:25,527 --> 01:01:29,073
I like Beau. I like him a lot.
Then it's all settled!

744
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:32,086
Not so fast,
he hasn't asked me anything yet.

745
01:01:32,247 --> 01:01:36,022
You dressed yet, Mame, honey?
Come in, Beau, darling.

746
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:41,553
Oh, my, how handsome you look!
Well, likewise, Mame.

747
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,691
Hold it steady,
I want to get a picture of this.

748
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:58,103
That's it. Now, give me
a nice pose, Mame, darling.

749
01:01:58,296 --> 01:02:01,645
And big smile! That's a girl.

750
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:06,834
There we are. You have now
been immortalized in celluloid.

751
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:08,692
Patrick.

752
01:02:08,887 --> 01:02:13,841
You must have left it in my room.
I'll find it.

753
01:02:21,144 --> 01:02:22,605
Mame...

754
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,796
Thank you.

755
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,853
I've got something to say. I'll have
to say it fast or not say it at all.

756
01:02:32,054 --> 01:02:36,811
Talk slow then, Beau, darling.
I can listen fast.

757
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:42,734
Well, Mame, you and I don't
exactly come from the same world.

758
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:48,945
Not that I think I'm worth...
There comes a time in every life...

759
01:02:50,709 --> 01:02:54,287
Mame, I'm just gonna have
to come right out and say it.

760
01:03:00,598 --> 01:03:03,248
Well, I'm gonna ask you to...

761
01:03:03,509 --> 01:03:05,778
Mame, would you...?

762
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:10,708
I mean, could you...?
Mame! Mame, darling!

763
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:12,909
It's me, Sally Cato!

764
01:03:13,397 --> 01:03:17,259
I wanted to see if there was anything...
Oh, hello, Beau.

765
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:20,047
Was I interrupting?

766
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:24,340
There's the signal, darling!
Come on, let's hurry.

767
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:31,052
Well, shall we to the hounds?
Yeah, I'd love to meet your family.

768
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:54,867
We almost thought you wasn't coming.
Morning. Lovely day for a hunt.

769
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:57,931
Sugar, you look absolutely dreamy.

770
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:03,022
Say, boys, you can bring
Miss Dennis' horse around now!

771
01:04:03,669 --> 01:04:05,644
Well, what a break.

772
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:08,692
Glorious weather for the hunt.

773
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:12,457
I thought it might rain,
we'd call it off.

774
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:16,849
Well, where are we riding to?
Outside of the hounds, of course.

775
01:04:17,044 --> 01:04:20,557
It's a good 10-mile course,
for those that makes it.

776
01:04:20,755 --> 01:04:25,577
I can try.
This way, Auntie Mame.

777
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:31,955
Morning, Miss Dennis.
Morning.

778
01:04:38,324 --> 01:04:39,731
Well, has he?

779
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:43,272
Not yet. So I die an old maid
sometime before lunch.

780
01:04:43,476 --> 01:04:47,251
No, you won't. You look convincing,
like a magazine cover.

781
01:04:47,443 --> 01:04:49,832
<i>Horror Stories.</i>

782
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:03,561
What's in there?
That's the horse I picked out for you.

783
01:05:04,948 --> 01:05:08,112
What's his name?
Meditation.

784
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,921
I'll trip you. You'd only break a leg.

785
01:05:23,091 --> 01:05:27,084
I can't disgrace Beau,
not in front of all these people.

786
01:05:30,547 --> 01:05:33,198
Fix the animal in the eye
with a masterful gaze.

787
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:37,836
Fix the master in the eye
with an animal gaze.

788
01:05:38,036 --> 01:05:41,778
Fix the aster in the maze
with an animal guy.

789
01:06:41,105 --> 01:06:45,066
You look fit. They're bringing
the fox up from the icehouse.

790
01:06:45,265 --> 01:06:47,883
Come on, let's go, everybody!

791
01:06:57,073 --> 01:07:00,521
Goodbye, Yankee gal!

792
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:27,238
Where does she think she's going?
Look at him go!

793
01:07:27,441 --> 01:07:31,694
Fall off! Fall off!
Look out for that flood wall!

794
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:36,644
Auntie Mame, fall off! Fall off!
Look out! Look out!

795
01:07:38,735 --> 01:07:43,525
Danged if she didn't sail
clear over it! No hands!

796
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,255
Look at her! She's passing everybody!

797
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:33,132
She's passing the master
of the hounds! Very bad form.

798
01:08:33,295 --> 01:08:35,400
She's passing the dogs!

799
01:08:35,567 --> 01:08:38,796
Mother of Jefferson Davis,
she's passing the fox!

800
01:08:42,863 --> 01:08:46,409
Ms. Burnside! I was driving by.
I thought I saw...

801
01:08:46,575 --> 01:08:50,285
That couldn't be Meditation!
Yes, fine bit of horseflesh.

802
01:08:50,447 --> 01:08:53,294
He's a killer! I gotta stop this!

803
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:03,367
They're headed back this way!

804
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:12,428
Stay out of the flowerbed!
Get that horse out of my bougainvillea!

805
01:09:15,533 --> 01:09:18,021
She's heading for the icehouse!

806
01:09:32,813 --> 01:09:36,555
That's my car! That's county property!

807
01:09:43,469 --> 01:09:44,843
Mame!

808
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:49,513
Mame, where are you?
She come this way.

809
01:09:49,709 --> 01:09:52,677
There you are!
Darling, are you all right?

810
01:09:52,877 --> 01:09:56,838
If I hadn't grabbed on to this,
I'd have been in Nova Scotia!

811
01:09:57,037 --> 01:10:00,867
What happened to the fox?
Poor thing is all tuckered out.

812
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:03,306
Oh, my little love!

813
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:09,481
As county veterinarian, I commanded you
two years ago to destroy that horse!

814
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:13,451
Letting her ride this horse,
superb horsewoman that she is...

815
01:10:13,645 --> 01:10:15,587
...that was premeditated murder!

816
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:20,108
Let's have three cheers, everybody,
for my little Yankee!

817
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:24,578
What a seat that woman has!
What a magnificent seat!

818
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:28,076
Look here, everybody,
I want three cheers...

819
01:10:28,269 --> 01:10:32,742
...for the future Mrs. Beauregard
Jackson Pickett Burnside!

820
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:34,403
Hip, hip...
Hooray!

821
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,067
Hip, hip...
Hooray!

822
01:10:38,884 --> 01:10:40,739
Emory, come on home!

823
01:10:40,933 --> 01:10:44,511
Hot damn!
My sister's gonna bust a gut!

824
01:10:44,676 --> 01:10:46,912
What are y'all standing around for?

825
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:50,750
Come back to the house.
We'll have a glass of whiskey.

826
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:54,361
Oh, Beau!
Come on, Mame, darling.

827
01:10:54,563 --> 01:10:57,345
Here we are. Take it easy, now.

828
01:10:57,826 --> 01:11:01,950
Mame, I'm sorry about making
my proposal so public...

829
01:11:02,147 --> 01:11:06,173
...but I'm gonna do everything I can
to make you happy.

830
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:10,625
Of course, you'll have to educate me.
Make me more cosmopolitan.

831
01:11:10,818 --> 01:11:15,325
For a honeymoon, let's take a trip
around the world for a few years.

832
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:18,108
Oh, Beau! That's...

833
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,827
Darling, excuse me a minute.
Sure.

834
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:26,242
My little love.
Congratulations, Auntie Mame.

835
01:11:26,434 --> 01:11:30,558
Your Auntie Mame's in love
and very happy.

836
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:33,536
I won't see you for a long time.

837
01:11:33,731 --> 01:11:38,138
Patrick, nothing can ever
really separate us.

838
01:11:38,338 --> 01:11:40,705
You'll join us on all your vacations.

839
01:11:40,899 --> 01:11:44,128
The rest of the time,
you'll be busy at school.

840
01:11:44,322 --> 01:11:46,973
I'll just have two men instead of one.

841
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:50,073
And I'll write to you every day,
I promise.

842
01:11:50,274 --> 01:11:54,649
You don't think I'd run off and
abandon you to the Babcocks, do you?

843
01:11:54,851 --> 01:11:57,851
You're stuck with me
whether you like it or not.

844
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:01,247
Now let me see you smile.
I want to see it.

845
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:05,184
Where is it? That's my boy!

846
01:12:05,602 --> 01:12:11,232
Can I ask you just one question?
How did you stay on that horse?

847
01:12:11,746 --> 01:12:17,660
It's like New Haven with the bracelet.
I got stuck, but at the other end.

848
01:13:22,592 --> 01:13:27,513
"Dear Auntie Mame: I plan to spend this
holiday with Mr. Babcock in Darien."

849
01:13:27,713 --> 01:13:31,258
Hold it right there, darling.
Now, no higher, Beau.

850
01:13:32,513 --> 01:13:35,295
"Junior Babcock
and I have fun there...

851
01:13:35,488 --> 01:13:40,093
...and I have met the kids from all
the best families in Connecticut."

852
01:13:40,288 --> 01:13:41,717
Oh, dear.

853
01:13:54,912 --> 01:13:59,068
I have a feeling we should be
getting back. Patrick needs me.

854
01:13:59,264 --> 01:14:03,704
That last one was the best one yet.
Good, darling.

855
01:14:04,768 --> 01:14:08,924
Now, did you put film in this time?
I sure did.

856
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,915
Oh, dang!
Up, up, Rover! Up, up!

857
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,862
Mrs. Burnside.
Mr. Babcock.

858
01:14:24,062 --> 01:14:27,640
So good to see you again.
Thank you. Nice to see you.

859
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,300
Darling!

860
01:14:30,814 --> 01:14:32,724
Congratulations.
Thank you.

861
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:35,643
Mame! Up here, Mame, honey!

862
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:38,172
That's it. Give me a nice smile.

863
01:14:40,638 --> 01:14:42,493
I gotcha.

864
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:51,773
Mame, honey. Look up here.

865
01:14:51,966 --> 01:14:55,708
Come, Patrick. Do be careful, darling.

866
01:14:55,902 --> 01:15:01,139
Now, give me a nice smile.
Patrick, take off your hat.

867
01:15:01,342 --> 01:15:03,763
Now, give me a nice smile.

868
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,493
That's it.

869
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:09,141
I got it.

870
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,954
Dennis?
Hey, Dennis!

871
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:37,657
Sign here.
It's another one for you! Dennis!

872
01:15:37,822 --> 01:15:40,309
Siam this time.

873
01:15:41,694 --> 01:15:43,320
Thanks.

874
01:15:45,726 --> 01:15:47,930
Siam. "Dear Patrick:

875
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:52,597
Here's a handy woman to have
around the house. Love, Auntie Mame."

876
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:09,844
Here we are, darling.
You all right?

877
01:16:11,004 --> 01:16:13,371
Next time, let's take the elevator.

878
01:16:13,564 --> 01:16:17,688
It's 10,000 feet up.
We only got another mile to go.

879
01:16:17,884 --> 01:16:20,786
Why don't you stay here
and rest a while?

880
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:23,322
I'll go up and get some film of you.

881
01:16:23,516 --> 01:16:26,712
I'll finish Patrick's letter.
All right.

882
01:16:29,148 --> 01:16:31,603
"Have to dash.
Dinner at Uncle Dwight's.

883
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:35,929
That's Babcock,
the baboon-faced boy to you.

884
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:39,769
Old Babcock's introducing me
to all the blond heiresses...

885
01:16:39,964 --> 01:16:42,681
...on the Eastern seaboard."

886
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:45,942
Blond heiresses? Dwight?

887
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,733
Beau? Beau!

888
01:16:47,932 --> 01:16:52,405
I knew that letter was worrying you.
I already made reservations back.

889
01:16:52,604 --> 01:16:55,735
Good. Well then, let's get back down.

890
01:16:55,932 --> 01:16:59,380
Wait a minute,
I still got a little more film left.

891
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:03,158
Mame, would you mind
stepping back just a bit?

892
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:08,817
I'd rather not.
Never mind, I'll scale up higher.

893
01:17:09,019 --> 01:17:11,125
Now, Beau, no higher!

894
01:17:12,092 --> 01:17:14,994
Take this.
It keeps on getting in my way.

895
01:17:15,196 --> 01:17:18,043
Take hold of the other end
for your balance.

896
01:17:18,236 --> 01:17:22,098
Don't you worry.
Just be looking out at the view there.

897
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:27,989
Hold it now, will you?
Now, you hold on tight while I re-focus.

898
01:18:02,775 --> 01:18:08,371
Heavens, this looks like
the main chapel of a funeral parlor.

899
01:18:08,535 --> 01:18:12,561
Haven't Norah and lto been alerted?
They'll be here tomorrow.

900
01:18:12,758 --> 01:18:15,857
What's that thing supposed to be?
A Dictaphone.

901
01:18:16,054 --> 01:18:20,943
She'll never use it. Patrick's carried
all this junk up here for nothing.

902
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:26,031
Mame can't stay still long enough
to write a postcard, let alone a book.

903
01:18:26,231 --> 01:18:29,744
No, he was right.
Mame can't go on living in a vacuum.

904
01:18:29,942 --> 01:18:33,204
She's always got to have a project.
She's got one.

905
01:18:33,399 --> 01:18:38,221
Now, she's the tragic queen.
She's having such fun being miserable.

906
01:18:38,423 --> 01:18:43,311
All she's done for 10 months is revisit
the places she's been with Beau.

907
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:48,529
Eight times, she climbed the Matterhorn
to throw rose petals down the glacier.

908
01:18:48,694 --> 01:18:50,799
I should have gone to meet her.

909
01:18:50,966 --> 01:18:53,388
I haven't seen her since the funeral.

910
01:18:53,559 --> 01:18:56,854
Wasn't it just like Mame
to keep him till I got there?

911
01:18:57,015 --> 01:19:02,165
Listen, you cynic, she was in love
with him. She's changed, I tell you.

912
01:19:03,094 --> 01:19:05,745
Look, I'll get some champagne.

913
01:19:05,943 --> 01:19:08,147
I'll answer it.

914
01:19:14,868 --> 01:19:17,040
Mame!

915
01:19:17,269 --> 01:19:19,822
She can't have changed that much.

916
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:22,192
I'm from Speed-O.
You're what?

917
01:19:22,388 --> 01:19:25,454
Patrick called a secretarial service.
Your name?

918
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,213
Agnes Gooch.

919
01:19:27,413 --> 01:19:31,919
You'll be taking dictation from
Mrs. Burnside. She talks very fast.

920
01:19:32,117 --> 01:19:36,394
Speed-O won't let anybody out
who can't do 180 words a minute.

921
01:19:36,596 --> 01:19:39,662
I'm over 200.
No, you're not.

922
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:43,723
She may let loose
with a million words and ideas.

923
01:19:43,924 --> 01:19:46,380
Soak them all up, like a sponge.

924
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:49,897
Speed-O better have symbols
for four-letter words.

925
01:19:50,101 --> 01:19:52,621
Lindsay, Mame will never write a book.

926
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:56,586
But Patrick got a fella to help her.
He'll be here at 3:00.

927
01:19:56,756 --> 01:19:57,869
What fella?

928
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:06,348
That's the signal.
What signal?

929
01:20:06,548 --> 01:20:11,982
Patrick wants us to surprise Mame.
Come on, hide. In there, quick!

930
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:18,290
You too, Miss Gooch.

931
01:20:19,253 --> 01:20:22,035
Why are you ringing?
Don't you have a key?

932
01:20:22,324 --> 01:20:25,805
Oh, of course! What am I thinking of?

933
01:20:30,452 --> 01:20:32,045
Welcome home.

934
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:36,042
Good old Beekman Place.
Always so loyal.

935
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:41,100
No matter how far I go, it waits
for me. I hope you used it weekends.

936
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:46,451
No, I didn't. I usually go from school
to Connecticut, to Uncle Dwight's.

937
01:20:46,612 --> 01:20:49,993
I did rather expect Vera
to be down at the boat.

938
01:20:50,194 --> 01:20:53,456
I wouldn't let her.
I wanted to be alone with you.

939
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:57,131
Patrick! My little Patrick.

940
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:59,851
Now, open your presents.

941
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:05,353
I can't get over it. Every time I see
you, you're taller and more grown-up.

942
01:21:05,554 --> 01:21:10,027
Oh, golly, short pants! At last.
Can I try them on right now?

943
01:21:10,195 --> 01:21:11,471
Right now.

944
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:16,107
Surprise! Welcome home, Mame!

945
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:19,020
Vera.

946
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:24,969
And dear, staunch, stalwart Lindsay.

947
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:29,360
How good of you both to rally
around this bereft old woman.

948
01:21:29,554 --> 01:21:32,237
Doesn't she look great?
How can you tell?

949
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:35,216
Couldn't you have gone
to purple by now?

950
01:21:35,411 --> 01:21:39,917
Come on, Auntie Mame,
champagne and fishberry jam.

951
01:21:40,114 --> 01:21:43,310
No, Patrick. The bubbles
no longer tickle my nose.

952
01:21:43,506 --> 01:21:46,921
I've given up alcohol,
along with everything else.

953
01:21:47,123 --> 01:21:51,083
It's wonderful of you all.
Very touching, but... What's that?

954
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:55,244
It's your Dictaphone
and your typewriter.

955
01:21:56,402 --> 01:21:59,534
And what's that?
I'm your sponge.

956
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:02,796
This is your secretary.
My secretary?

957
01:22:02,995 --> 01:22:07,185
Yes. You'll write your autobiography.
Me? Write a book?

958
01:22:07,378 --> 01:22:09,834
No one's had a more colorful life.

959
01:22:10,034 --> 01:22:14,093
You've known fascinating people:
Winston Churchill, Gandhi, me.

960
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:18,568
You'll be so busy digging up the past,
you won't think of the present.

961
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:21,453
And I promise to publish it.
Oh, I see.

962
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:24,072
This is some sort of conspiracy.

963
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:28,136
Some trumped-up occupational therapy,
like basket weaving.

964
01:22:28,338 --> 01:22:32,493
I swear, it'll be a bestseller.
And you'd be doing me a favor.

965
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:36,748
My memoirs? Patrick, my drink.
Champagne?

966
01:22:36,945 --> 01:22:42,476
Anything, just make it double. I see
it in two volumes. Boxed, like Proust.

967
01:22:42,672 --> 01:22:47,429
Let me see. Chapter one, page one.
She's supposed to start right now?

968
01:22:47,632 --> 01:22:53,797
This isn't so difficult. Another drink.
Where was I? Chapter one, page one...

969
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,317
What are you writing?
"Chapter one, page one.

970
01:22:57,488 --> 01:23:02,442
This isn't so difficult. Another drink.
Where was I? What are you writing?"

971
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,233
She is fast.

972
01:23:04,496 --> 01:23:06,056
You're off and running.

973
01:23:06,257 --> 01:23:10,828
Should I do this? lt'll take up all
my time. I came home to be with you.

974
01:23:11,024 --> 01:23:14,636
After all, you can't be with me.
No women in the dorm.

975
01:23:14,832 --> 01:23:17,004
I forgot, you're grown-up now.

976
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,194
You don't need me anymore.
Nobody needs me anymore. It's sad...

977
01:23:21,392 --> 01:23:23,050
How do you turn her off?

978
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:26,564
The most important thing is
to have a good beginning.

979
01:23:26,736 --> 01:23:30,413
Wait for your collaborator.
Collaborator?

980
01:23:30,609 --> 01:23:34,154
Yes. My friend got a kind
of editor to work with you.

981
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,808
Fella named O'Bannion.

982
01:23:37,073 --> 01:23:41,546
You don't trust me to write
my own life? He got me a ghost!

983
01:23:41,744 --> 01:23:45,127
It's not a ghost.
I see it all now. A ghostwriter!

984
01:23:45,328 --> 01:23:48,841
I won't expose my life
to some beer-drinking Irishman...

985
01:23:49,008 --> 01:23:52,488
...who leads a low, common life
in some Third Avenue bar!

986
01:23:52,848 --> 01:23:56,809
You don't trust me to write my life?
Who else could write it?

987
01:23:57,008 --> 01:23:59,179
Whoever this creature is...

988
01:23:59,344 --> 01:24:02,159
Mr. O'Bannion to see you.

989
01:24:04,112 --> 01:24:08,552
I was asked to drop by to meet
the fabulous Mrs. Burnside.

990
01:24:12,143 --> 01:24:14,761
You are she, of course.

991
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:19,115
I can sense the aura
of creative vitality about you.

992
01:24:28,142 --> 01:24:32,365
Won't you come in, Mr. O'Bannion?

993
01:24:37,774 --> 01:24:40,873
I thought by way
of introduction, Mrs. Burnside...

994
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:45,805
<i>...l'd present you with a slim volume
of my poems, The Parched Garden.</i>

995
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,715
What a lovely title. Thank you.

996
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,918
Do you mind if I sit down?

997
01:24:51,118 --> 01:24:55,373
That long ride up in the elevator,
it's after getting me dizzy.

998
01:24:55,566 --> 01:24:59,625
I'll get you a bit of water.
No, please don't bother.

999
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:03,525
Of course, a bit of champagne,
if it's handy.

1000
01:25:03,727 --> 01:25:05,614
Patrick.

1001
01:25:05,806 --> 01:25:08,457
It seems to help.

1002
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:13,705
Thank you.

1003
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:17,321
It's the other one.

1004
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,652
Tell me, how did it happen?

1005
01:25:23,854 --> 01:25:27,050
Well, it was in 1922.
The Great Rebellion.

1006
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:34,253
Even a lad of 15 can feel strongly
about his country's independence.

1007
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:43,114
How nice.

1008
01:25:45,326 --> 01:25:47,017
Tell me, Mr. O'Bannion.

1009
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:50,890
Do you think you and I
can ever get anyplace?

1010
01:25:52,812 --> 01:25:54,722
With the book, I mean.

1011
01:25:54,892 --> 01:25:57,762
Well, we've both known sorrow.

1012
01:25:58,636 --> 01:26:02,630
I feel that you and I are going
to create something.

1013
01:26:03,628 --> 01:26:05,865
Something beautiful.

1014
01:26:20,173 --> 01:26:23,784
Actually, my child, it was so sad.
Mother died in childbirth.

1015
01:26:23,948 --> 01:26:27,690
It was a dreadful thing.
And Father traveled all the time.

1016
01:26:27,853 --> 01:26:31,235
How difficult he was.
But I must be fair to Father.

1017
01:26:31,404 --> 01:26:36,619
Remind me to do a whole new chapter
about him. No, no, take that out.

1018
01:26:39,276 --> 01:26:42,058
And I had to start working
when I was 8.

1019
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:46,246
I went next door and said,
"Can I baby-sit? Can I do something?"

1020
01:26:46,412 --> 01:26:52,108
After all, I was a child. I said,
"I need clothes. Parties. Pretties."

1021
01:27:12,716 --> 01:27:14,407
Please.

1022
01:27:14,828 --> 01:27:17,163
Please, Miss Gooch!

1023
01:27:18,572 --> 01:27:23,111
How can I court the muse
with all that clackety-clack?

1024
01:27:23,276 --> 01:27:28,940
I'm sorry. I'm only taking off
what Mrs. Burnside dictated.

1025
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:32,578
Everything Mrs. Burnside
dictates is so wonderful.

1026
01:27:32,746 --> 01:27:36,095
When I think of the things
she's done...

1027
01:27:36,266 --> 01:27:40,641
...and think of the things
I haven't done, I could just die.

1028
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:43,560
But it's so exciting
being in this house.

1029
01:27:43,722 --> 01:27:46,624
Just imagine, a Japanese houseboy...

1030
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:49,696
...all those artistic friends...

1031
01:27:49,866 --> 01:27:52,800
...and you, Mr. O'Bannion.

1032
01:27:53,002 --> 01:27:56,547
I'll get it, Brian. Hello.

1033
01:27:56,714 --> 01:27:58,536
Hello, Lindsay.

1034
01:27:58,698 --> 01:28:00,771
It's coming along.

1035
01:28:00,938 --> 01:28:06,023
Well, it's only been three months.
Brian is polishing and perfecting it.

1036
01:28:06,186 --> 01:28:08,739
A party? Oh, I'd...

1037
01:28:09,866 --> 01:28:12,800
No, I'm afraid not.
Brian couldn't possibly...

1038
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:14,879
What is it, my dear?

1039
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:18,279
Lindsay feels that Warner Bros.
might pay for our book...

1040
01:28:18,442 --> 01:28:24,039
...as a vehicle for Bette Davis. He's
meeting Jack Warner tonight, but l...

1041
01:28:26,154 --> 01:28:29,699
Mrs. Burnside and I couldn't
possibly allow our work...

1042
01:28:29,866 --> 01:28:32,387
...to be defiled
by a movie company.

1043
01:28:32,554 --> 01:28:36,776
But, just as a courtesy,
we'll come and discuss it.

1044
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:40,420
About 8:30? A black tie?

1045
01:28:40,586 --> 01:28:43,749
All right, and thank you very much.
Goodbye.

1046
01:28:43,914 --> 01:28:48,835
Brian, you accepted! It might do you
good to get back in the world.

1047
01:28:49,002 --> 01:28:52,831
Here's what you dictated.
Thank you.

1048
01:28:53,002 --> 01:28:56,777
And here's what Mr. O'Bannion edited.

1049
01:28:57,706 --> 01:29:01,536
Mr. O'Bannion and I are going to work,
so why don't you do...

1050
01:29:01,705 --> 01:29:04,072
...whatever it is you do do to relax.

1051
01:29:04,234 --> 01:29:06,088
Thank you, Mrs. Burnside.

1052
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:10,656
I think I'll just fix myself
a Dr. Pepper.

1053
01:29:14,632 --> 01:29:17,567
I'm worried.
We have little to show Mr. Warner.

1054
01:29:17,736 --> 01:29:21,991
We'll tell him the story. How long
will it take to finish this book?

1055
01:29:22,152 --> 01:29:25,632
<i>Flaubert spent 13 years
on Madame Bovary.</i>

1056
01:29:27,176 --> 01:29:29,859
Where were we?
Give us our last sentence.

1057
01:29:30,024 --> 01:29:32,293
"My puberty in Buffalo was drab."

1058
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:37,442
Oh, no, no. It has no majesty.
"Drab" is such a drab word.

1059
01:29:37,608 --> 01:29:42,529
How right you are, Brian.
It has no afflatus.

1060
01:29:44,136 --> 01:29:45,762
What about "bleak"?

1061
01:29:45,928 --> 01:29:49,310
Bleak? Bleak.
How bleak was my puberty.

1062
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:53,309
Bleak Buffalo! Hear how
the words cling to each other?

1063
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:57,920
Like a man and woman in each other's
arms. Listen to the words sing!

1064
01:29:58,088 --> 01:30:01,950
How bleak was my puberty!

1065
01:30:04,168 --> 01:30:06,022
I'm sorry.

1066
01:30:06,184 --> 01:30:11,618
Come, Mame. Let us lie down in front
of the fire and stare at the flames.

1067
01:30:11,783 --> 01:30:15,460
It will help stir the flames
of our inspiration.

1068
01:30:15,623 --> 01:30:17,729
Yes. Well, now, Brian.

1069
01:30:17,896 --> 01:30:21,475
Will the general public understand
all this symbolism?

1070
01:30:21,639 --> 01:30:24,192
"Like an echo from the caves
of Kakamora...

1071
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:28,638
...I came forth whilst Deirdre
wept cool tears."

1072
01:30:28,808 --> 01:30:33,445
Wouldn't it be simpler to say, "The
day I was born, it rained in Buffalo"?

1073
01:30:33,608 --> 01:30:36,096
It's drab.
It's drab, but it's clear.

1074
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:42,014
Here is clarity. I stayed awake half
the night to sift it from obscurity.

1075
01:30:42,184 --> 01:30:45,926
<i>In the blank gray midnight
of me haunted garden</i>

1076
01:30:46,088 --> 01:30:50,843
<i>Your soft form appeared raining
kisses on the parched earth of me lips.</i>

1077
01:30:51,014 --> 01:30:53,502
What's come over you?
Now, you mustn't!

1078
01:30:53,669 --> 01:30:57,979
Besides, it takes Agnes no time at all
to knock off a Dr. Pepper.

1079
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:00,066
Brian, you mustn't!

1080
01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:03,678
<i>Do not withdraw this wondrous water,
for without you...</i>

1081
01:31:03,846 --> 01:31:06,115
I rinsed out the glass.

1082
01:31:06,278 --> 01:31:08,733
Aren't you neat?

1083
01:31:11,046 --> 01:31:16,098
It came from the fiber of my being.
That's why I'm so tired today.

1084
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:21,629
You could revitalize me
with a single, motherly kiss.

1085
01:31:23,814 --> 01:31:25,505
What's happened to you?

1086
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:28,452
I'm revitalized!
You're recharged.

1087
01:31:28,614 --> 01:31:32,291
Don't you come near me!
You're old enough to be my mother!

1088
01:31:32,454 --> 01:31:35,421
I'm going to your room...
I mean, my room. Ito!

1089
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:39,452
You'll kill yourself.
What a way to die. I'm mad for you.

1090
01:31:39,622 --> 01:31:45,056
You've poured your strength into me.
And I want to pour it right back.

1091
01:31:49,574 --> 01:31:50,784
This is ridiculous.

1092
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:54,779
It's like having a crush
on your teacher. Or your analyst.

1093
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:56,608
Stop it!

1094
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:58,848
Hello, anybody?

1095
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,540
Patrick.

1096
01:32:01,318 --> 01:32:02,845
Hello, Auntie Mame.

1097
01:32:04,294 --> 01:32:07,872
Hello, Dennis.
I'm so glad to see you, darling.

1098
01:32:08,101 --> 01:32:11,484
Mrs. Burnside and I were
just working on the book.

1099
01:32:11,814 --> 01:32:16,091
I bet that's gonna be some book.
Why are you home from school?

1100
01:32:16,262 --> 01:32:17,855
I had to talk to you.

1101
01:32:18,022 --> 01:32:22,462
You have things to talk about.
I'll go to my room and change.

1102
01:32:24,614 --> 01:32:27,331
His room? Is he living here?
Of course.

1103
01:32:27,494 --> 01:32:29,829
He was living in some miserable flat.

1104
01:32:29,988 --> 01:32:32,857
Since we're working together
night and day...

1105
01:32:33,028 --> 01:32:35,962
Let me tell you something about
that spiritual Irish poet...

1106
01:32:36,132 --> 01:32:40,540
You don't have to tell me a thing.
It looks very cozy.

1107
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:45,344
For a minute, you sounded like
someone from the Knickerbocker Bank.

1108
01:32:45,508 --> 01:32:48,355
Please get O'Bannion out of here.
Right away.

1109
01:32:48,515 --> 01:32:52,225
I beg your pardon?
I don't want him in this house.

1110
01:32:52,388 --> 01:32:57,145
Aren't you taking rather an imperious
tone? Mr. O'Bannion is my colleague.

1111
01:32:57,315 --> 01:33:01,952
Colleague, my foot!
Gloria would never understand...

1112
01:33:02,115 --> 01:33:04,734
Who is Gloria?

1113
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:08,031
Auntie Mame, listen to me.
I've met a girl.

1114
01:33:08,196 --> 01:33:11,163
I've been going with her
for several months.

1115
01:33:12,228 --> 01:33:15,457
She's a very special girl, and...

1116
01:33:17,252 --> 01:33:19,870
I should have told you
about her before.

1117
01:33:20,036 --> 01:33:23,648
I would have, but I knew you
were tied up with the book...

1118
01:33:23,908 --> 01:33:25,501
...and everything.

1119
01:33:25,732 --> 01:33:28,034
And until now it wasn't definite.

1120
01:33:28,196 --> 01:33:30,083
What's definite now?

1121
01:33:30,244 --> 01:33:32,830
Gloria's the girl.
That's what's definite.

1122
01:33:32,996 --> 01:33:37,338
You're going to meet her. Tonight.
You didn't leave her in the car?

1123
01:33:37,508 --> 01:33:41,534
I left her at her girlfriend's house.
She wanted to spruce up.

1124
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:45,278
I'd better spruce up too.
I'll bring her in 10 minutes.

1125
01:33:45,444 --> 01:33:47,484
I'll have my face all organized.

1126
01:33:47,652 --> 01:33:50,881
What did you do with
me evening slippers?

1127
01:33:51,044 --> 01:33:54,011
It's all right. I found them.
Wait a minute.

1128
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,460
If he's still in the house...

1129
01:33:58,628 --> 01:34:01,595
...l'm not gonna bring Gloria
back here.

1130
01:34:01,764 --> 01:34:03,586
May I inquire why?

1131
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:08,733
Gloria is a very sensitive
and well brought-up girl.

1132
01:34:08,899 --> 01:34:11,712
I don't want you flaunting
your new flames...

1133
01:34:11,874 --> 01:34:14,624
...and old peccadilloes
in front of her.

1134
01:34:16,066 --> 01:34:18,968
Then why bring her here at all?

1135
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:22,556
Want to know the truth?
I've been trying to avoid it.

1136
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:25,023
She wanted to meet you.

1137
01:34:25,985 --> 01:34:28,058
I see.

1138
01:34:28,226 --> 01:34:31,193
You dropped by to see
that I was all...

1139
01:34:31,362 --> 01:34:35,420
...scrubbed up and presentable
for inspection, is that it?

1140
01:34:35,585 --> 01:34:37,146
Yes.

1141
01:34:37,378 --> 01:34:39,833
And to tell you that
while she's here...

1142
01:34:40,002 --> 01:34:43,777
...for five minutes to try to act
like a normal human being.

1143
01:34:43,938 --> 01:34:47,004
Gloria's from
a very conservative family.

1144
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,721
She doesn't have to know
about things...

1145
01:34:49,889 --> 01:34:52,824
...ordinary mortals
simply don't have to know about.

1146
01:34:56,322 --> 01:35:00,828
Should she know you've turned into
one of the most beastly, bourgeois...

1147
01:35:00,993 --> 01:35:04,823
...Babbitty little snobs
on the Eastern seaboard?

1148
01:35:08,481 --> 01:35:13,664
Or will you be able to make that
quite clear without any help from me?

1149
01:35:17,985 --> 01:35:20,855
Well, it's been nice knowing you.

1150
01:35:22,658 --> 01:35:24,283
Patrick?

1151
01:35:25,697 --> 01:35:27,257
Auntie Mame?

1152
01:35:29,378 --> 01:35:32,793
Darling. I love you so.

1153
01:35:32,962 --> 01:35:37,883
I'd do anything for you. I'd denounce
Calvin Coolidge as a Bolshevik.

1154
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:42,905
Gloria had better like you or
I'll bill her one square in the chops.

1155
01:35:43,074 --> 01:35:48,770
I'll get him out of here and have
the whole place fumigated. I promise.

1156
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:02,523
Thanks, Auntie Mame.

1157
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:25,912
Brian?

1158
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:33,371
Why aren't you dressed?
Would you mind going without me?

1159
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,405
You want me to go alone?
Something came up.

1160
01:36:36,576 --> 01:36:41,726
Hurry up and get dressed.
I am not going to that party alone.

1161
01:36:59,423 --> 01:37:05,468
If there's nothing more you wanted,
I just thought I'd go up to my room.

1162
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:11,414
Agnes.

1163
01:37:17,215 --> 01:37:19,549
I wonder.

1164
01:37:19,776 --> 01:37:23,037
Is anything wrong, Mrs. Burnside?

1165
01:37:26,144 --> 01:37:29,308
You're coming out.
Where?

1166
01:37:29,472 --> 01:37:31,891
You know, you have
very beautiful eyes.

1167
01:37:32,061 --> 01:37:34,395
Take these glasses off forever.

1168
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:36,826
I can't see out of my right eye.

1169
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:40,601
Then look out of your left one.
Now, now, now, now.

1170
01:37:41,117 --> 01:37:43,867
You do have a bust!

1171
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:47,292
Where have you been hiding that
all these months?

1172
01:37:47,454 --> 01:37:50,268
What do you call those?
Orthopedic Oxfords.

1173
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:53,746
Kick them off. Now take
off your clothes. Norah, lto!

1174
01:37:53,918 --> 01:37:56,306
There's a man in the house.

1175
01:37:56,477 --> 01:38:00,055
Will you stop being a goose
and get these clothes off?

1176
01:38:00,221 --> 01:38:03,418
Norah? lto? Where are you
when I need you?

1177
01:38:03,582 --> 01:38:08,154
I don't have a very clear picture
of what's going on.

1178
01:38:08,318 --> 01:38:10,205
Now, Agnes, dear...

1179
01:38:10,365 --> 01:38:14,522
...I am sending you to that party
tonight with Mr. O'Bannion.

1180
01:38:14,686 --> 01:38:18,712
I couldn't. I'm too nervous!

1181
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:21,523
This will calm you down.

1182
01:38:21,693 --> 01:38:25,141
Oh, no! Spirits do
the most terrible things to me.

1183
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:29,085
I'm not the same girl.
What's wrong with that?

1184
01:38:29,246 --> 01:38:31,253
Will it mix with Dr. Pepper?

1185
01:38:31,422 --> 01:38:33,877
He'll love it. Drink!

1186
01:38:35,229 --> 01:38:37,531
Norah, go get my black Patou velvet.

1187
01:38:37,693 --> 01:38:41,141
Ito, lay out my cosmetics,
my cold cream, everything.

1188
01:38:41,309 --> 01:38:44,658
You see, me be Charlie of the Ritz.

1189
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:47,091
Come, child.

1190
01:38:47,261 --> 01:38:52,346
I think I know what you want me to do.
I'm not a bit sure I want to do it.

1191
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:54,200
Agnes, where is your spine?

1192
01:38:54,366 --> 01:38:57,911
You've taken my dictation for weeks and
you don't get the message of my book.

1193
01:38:58,077 --> 01:39:00,216
Live, that's the message.
Live?

1194
01:39:00,381 --> 01:39:04,210
Yes! Life is a banquet and
most poor suckers are starving.

1195
01:39:04,381 --> 01:39:08,538
Now, come on, Agnes, live!
Come, child. Live!

1196
01:39:19,068 --> 01:39:21,010
The whole place has gone nuts.

1197
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:25,009
She'll never make a silk purse
out of that sow's ear.

1198
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:29,461
Mrs. Burnside, I can't breathe!

1199
01:39:29,628 --> 01:39:34,417
Good, good. If you can breathe,
it isn't tight enough.

1200
01:39:36,667 --> 01:39:40,890
And why aren't you dressed?
I am not going to that party tonight.

1201
01:39:41,051 --> 01:39:45,361
Then I'm not going either.
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not!

1202
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:50,103
Well, you can use the Duesenberg.

1203
01:39:51,964 --> 01:39:54,997
And I have a date for you.

1204
01:39:55,196 --> 01:39:56,756
Agnes?

1205
01:39:57,564 --> 01:40:00,760
Agnes?! You can't expect...

1206
01:40:00,923 --> 01:40:03,989
Would you ask Toscanini
to lead a harmonica band?

1207
01:40:04,155 --> 01:40:07,286
I won't take Gooch,
she's an offense to the sight.

1208
01:40:07,451 --> 01:40:11,193
It's good her mother, the Countess
de Gooch, can't hear you.

1209
01:40:11,356 --> 01:40:13,330
She'd pull your beard.

1210
01:40:13,499 --> 01:40:16,565
Countess? You're joking.

1211
01:40:16,731 --> 01:40:20,986
Surely you've heard of the de Gooches?
Second wealthiest bankers.

1212
01:40:21,147 --> 01:40:24,017
Fabulous estate at Newport.

1213
01:40:24,188 --> 01:40:28,694
This child is just doing this
for a little literary experience.

1214
01:40:28,859 --> 01:40:31,674
Agnes. No, no, no.

1215
01:40:31,835 --> 01:40:36,308
Agnes, head up, dear.
Shoulders back. Tummy in.

1216
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:40,432
Agnes, tonight you are
queen of Romania.

1217
01:40:48,956 --> 01:40:53,972
Agnes. On your feet.
Darling, you look divine.

1218
01:40:54,137 --> 01:40:57,334
Do I really?
Yes, now come along.

1219
01:40:59,129 --> 01:41:01,333
Enchanting.

1220
01:41:02,905 --> 01:41:04,727
Golly.

1221
01:41:05,145 --> 01:41:08,015
Hang those furs on the Gooch. Hurry.

1222
01:41:11,994 --> 01:41:16,304
Auntie Mame, Gloria Upson.
This is my Auntie Mame, Mrs. Burnside.

1223
01:41:16,473 --> 01:41:20,848
I can't tell you how pleased
I am to make your acquaintance.

1224
01:41:21,017 --> 01:41:24,246
Yes. Come in, children.
Do, please.

1225
01:41:25,082 --> 01:41:27,667
There's some friends
I'd like you to meet.

1226
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:31,761
This is my secretary, Miss Gooch.
My Boswell, as it were.

1227
01:41:31,929 --> 01:41:36,053
Miss Upson and my nephew, Patrick.
What is your boyfriend's name?

1228
01:41:36,217 --> 01:41:38,584
O'Bannion. Mr. O'Bannion.

1229
01:41:38,745 --> 01:41:42,258
Well, now, you two run along
and have a good time.

1230
01:41:42,425 --> 01:41:45,589
Well, good night!

1231
01:41:47,353 --> 01:41:51,096
I can't tell you how pleased I am
to have met you, Mr. O'Bannion.

1232
01:41:51,257 --> 01:41:53,112
And Miss Boswell.

1233
01:41:54,617 --> 01:41:58,130
Well, Patrick tells me
how special you are to him.

1234
01:41:58,297 --> 01:42:01,909
That means you're very special
to me too.

1235
01:42:02,585 --> 01:42:05,934
My, what a stunning apartment.
Thank you.

1236
01:42:06,106 --> 01:42:09,172
Books are awfully decorative,
don't you think?

1237
01:42:09,338 --> 01:42:11,280
Won't you sit down?

1238
01:42:11,449 --> 01:42:15,410
Can I get you something? A cognac?
Another hot chocolate?

1239
01:42:15,577 --> 01:42:20,433
Not a thing. On our way to Bunny's,
my friend who lives on Park Avenue...

1240
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:24,213
...Patrick and I just stuffed
ourselves at Schrafft's.

1241
01:42:24,377 --> 01:42:27,094
Do you know what
your silly nephew did?

1242
01:42:27,257 --> 01:42:30,157
He spoke French to the counterman.

1243
01:42:30,327 --> 01:42:35,630
Imagine anybody speaking French
to a counterman at Schrafft's.

1244
01:42:35,864 --> 01:42:38,100
Showoff.

1245
01:42:42,135 --> 01:42:46,029
If nobody minds,
I think I'll have something.

1246
01:42:46,455 --> 01:42:49,521
You're at school, dear?

1247
01:42:50,199 --> 01:42:52,850
I'm an Upper Richmond
Girls' School girl.

1248
01:42:53,015 --> 01:42:56,310
How did you get that lovely tan
so early in spring?

1249
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:58,893
I played hooky for a couple of weeks.

1250
01:42:59,063 --> 01:43:03,667
Mums and Daddums and I went
to our place in Fort Lauderdale.

1251
01:43:03,831 --> 01:43:06,930
I was out of my mind
until she got back.

1252
01:43:07,095 --> 01:43:11,088
I'm insanely jealous of this kid.
It's torture and I love it.

1253
01:43:11,255 --> 01:43:12,749
Silly.

1254
01:43:18,615 --> 01:43:22,412
Tell me, dear, have you
chosen your major yet?

1255
01:43:23,927 --> 01:43:26,196
Chosen my major?

1256
01:43:26,359 --> 01:43:29,326
What courses are you taking
at college?

1257
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:34,383
Just a general sort of liberal arts
thing. English Lit and like that.

1258
01:43:34,551 --> 01:43:39,155
Upper Richmond's top drawer.
Really top drawer.

1259
01:43:41,719 --> 01:43:44,621
How did you two ever get acquainted?

1260
01:43:44,823 --> 01:43:47,092
Uncle Dwight introduced us.

1261
01:43:47,255 --> 01:43:49,841
Uncle Dwight? Oh, yes.

1262
01:43:50,743 --> 01:43:52,980
Well, he's not really my uncle.

1263
01:43:53,143 --> 01:43:57,136
But he's been a close friend
of the family since I was a girl...

1264
01:43:57,303 --> 01:43:59,824
...with braces on my teeth.

1265
01:44:00,695 --> 01:44:03,151
One day I must meet Mums and Daddums.

1266
01:44:03,351 --> 01:44:05,773
We won't bother you with family stuff.

1267
01:44:05,943 --> 01:44:09,489
Naturally, we'll expect you
at the wedding.

1268
01:44:10,581 --> 01:44:12,686
The wedding?

1269
01:44:13,237 --> 01:44:14,830
Is there a wedding?

1270
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:18,707
I told you it was definite,
Auntie Mame.

1271
01:44:19,925 --> 01:44:23,220
Well, it's awfully good of you
to let me know.

1272
01:44:24,309 --> 01:44:28,270
We've decided on a September wedding
at our place in Montebank.

1273
01:44:28,437 --> 01:44:33,293
September?
Tell me, just where is Montebank?

1274
01:44:33,461 --> 01:44:35,795
It's above Darien. You'll love it.

1275
01:44:35,957 --> 01:44:39,154
It's awfully pretty
and terribly handy to the city.

1276
01:44:39,317 --> 01:44:42,350
Of course, it's completely restricted.

1277
01:44:44,021 --> 01:44:45,876
I'll get a blood test.

1278
01:44:46,037 --> 01:44:49,201
We'd better hurry
to catch that Italian picture.

1279
01:44:49,365 --> 01:44:54,318
Those awful foreign movies.
What I go through for your nephew.

1280
01:44:54,485 --> 01:44:56,754
But he is kind of cute, isn't he?

1281
01:44:56,917 --> 01:44:58,772
Yes, isn't he?

1282
01:44:59,381 --> 01:45:02,064
I'm pleased to have made
your acquaintance.

1283
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:03,887
Thank you, dear.

1284
01:45:06,165 --> 01:45:08,053
Well? Isn't she terrific?

1285
01:45:08,757 --> 01:45:10,667
Yes, dear. Yes, she is.

1286
01:45:11,093 --> 01:45:16,111
So are you, Auntie Mame.
You're really top drawer. I mean...

1287
01:45:16,661 --> 01:45:19,082
Well, you know what I mean.

1288
01:45:24,981 --> 01:45:29,203
Now, why did I ever buy him
those long pants?

1289
01:45:38,357 --> 01:45:42,864
Hang on to the red dye pot. I may
want it after visiting the Upsons.

1290
01:45:43,029 --> 01:45:45,996
It's just what you wanted.
Respectable.

1291
01:45:46,165 --> 01:45:48,653
If a bit drab.
Did you bring the car?

1292
01:45:48,821 --> 01:45:52,714
I go to garage. No Duesenberg.
Mr. O'Bannion no bring back.

1293
01:45:52,883 --> 01:45:55,436
I hope nothing has happened...
To Agnes.

1294
01:45:55,603 --> 01:46:00,305
I'll call Mr. Lindsay and borrow one.
Don't forget the maps and martinis.

1295
01:46:04,531 --> 01:46:07,084
What happened, Missy Gooch?

1296
01:46:07,699 --> 01:46:09,128
I lived.

1297
01:46:09,299 --> 01:46:10,989
What kind party was that?

1298
01:46:11,155 --> 01:46:16,393
I don't remember. All that champagne,
I don't remember a thing.

1299
01:46:16,562 --> 01:46:20,654
I think we went to a movie.
Yeah, there was a wedding in it.

1300
01:46:20,819 --> 01:46:23,404
And Gary Cooper was the groom.

1301
01:46:23,571 --> 01:46:27,183
I don't remember who the girl was,
but it made me cry.

1302
01:46:27,347 --> 01:46:28,874
Where's Mrs. Burnside?

1303
01:46:29,042 --> 01:46:31,977
She get ready for Connecticut.
Where Duesenberg?

1304
01:46:32,147 --> 01:46:36,555
I don't know. Mr. O'Bannion said
he just had to meet my mother.

1305
01:46:36,722 --> 01:46:41,578
Then we got on the Staten Island Ferry
and he disappeared.

1306
01:46:41,747 --> 01:46:44,594
I've got to see Mrs. Burnside
before she goes.

1307
01:46:44,755 --> 01:46:46,414
Is anything wrong?

1308
01:46:46,578 --> 01:46:50,473
I did just what she told me. I lived.

1309
01:46:50,643 --> 01:46:54,221
I've gotta find out what to do now.

1310
01:47:11,635 --> 01:47:15,497
I think it's a very good match
for our little Gloria.

1311
01:47:15,667 --> 01:47:18,766
Why didn't Dwight want us
to meet the aunt?

1312
01:47:18,931 --> 01:47:21,484
We never would have
if she hadn't phoned.

1313
01:47:21,651 --> 01:47:25,579
I'm glad she did.
I've been dying to get a look at her.

1314
01:47:25,747 --> 01:47:29,292
Where is she now?
Freshening up in the guest room.

1315
01:47:29,459 --> 01:47:33,287
That certainly is an expensive outfit
she's wearing.

1316
01:47:33,457 --> 01:47:36,556
I looked at the label in her coat.

1317
01:47:37,137 --> 01:47:40,301
I'll bet she's better fixed
than Dwight figured.

1318
01:47:40,465 --> 01:47:44,175
I hope it's all right to have
a cocktail hour in the patio.

1319
01:47:44,337 --> 01:47:46,792
She may think we live like gypsies.

1320
01:47:47,089 --> 01:47:50,667
You show me a gypsy
that lives like we do.

1321
01:47:51,793 --> 01:47:56,812
Claude, you be genteel
in front of Mrs. Burnside.

1322
01:47:59,121 --> 01:48:00,976
That must be she.

1323
01:48:01,137 --> 01:48:04,301
We're out here on the patio,
Mrs. Burnside.

1324
01:48:06,577 --> 01:48:09,294
What a delightful spot you have here.

1325
01:48:09,457 --> 01:48:11,464
We adore Montebank.

1326
01:48:11,633 --> 01:48:15,408
Of course, we always spend summers
at our camp in the Adirondacks.

1327
01:48:15,569 --> 01:48:19,180
We call it Upson Pines.
We leave next week.

1328
01:48:19,344 --> 01:48:22,693
There's one thing we ought
to get straight right off.

1329
01:48:22,865 --> 01:48:26,313
You do take a little nip,
now and then?

1330
01:48:27,473 --> 01:48:29,862
On festive occasions.

1331
01:48:30,033 --> 01:48:31,560
Good!

1332
01:48:31,729 --> 01:48:34,576
I'll have an Upson daiquiri
ready in a minute.

1333
01:48:34,929 --> 01:48:39,686
I can't get over the thought you've
given every detail of your house.

1334
01:48:39,856 --> 01:48:44,810
We've done all we could to make it
seem like authentic Colonial America.

1335
01:48:44,977 --> 01:48:48,424
And how well you've succeeded.

1336
01:48:48,593 --> 01:48:52,871
Those enchanting miniatures in the
powder room of John Quincy Adams.

1337
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:56,074
Did you see our driveway signpost?
I did.

1338
01:48:56,241 --> 01:49:00,681
What a divine name you've
given this place, Upson Downs.

1339
01:49:00,849 --> 01:49:03,849
I'll bet you thought of that.
That was Claude.

1340
01:49:04,017 --> 01:49:07,945
I'm just a homebody.
Claude is the clever one.

1341
01:49:10,351 --> 01:49:13,002
Now, Mrs. Upson...
Doris, dear.

1342
01:49:13,167 --> 01:49:16,614
Doris, dear.
Well, you must call me Mame.

1343
01:49:16,783 --> 01:49:18,790
Mamie.

1344
01:49:18,991 --> 01:49:20,169
Mame.

1345
01:49:20,334 --> 01:49:23,683
Well, Mamie old girl,
here's your poison.

1346
01:49:23,855 --> 01:49:28,557
I use a secret ingredient I learned
from a native in Havana, Cuba.

1347
01:49:28,718 --> 01:49:32,613
You'll never guess what
that secret ingredient is.

1348
01:49:32,783 --> 01:49:37,868
I'll say this much, there's no sugar
in a Claude Upson daiquiri.

1349
01:49:38,991 --> 01:49:42,668
And yet it's so sweet.

1350
01:49:43,566 --> 01:49:46,217
Whatever do you use?

1351
01:49:46,383 --> 01:49:48,805
Chocolate ice cream?

1352
01:49:51,727 --> 01:49:53,865
Say, that's rich!

1353
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:57,609
Did you hear that, Doris?
Chocolate ice cream!

1354
01:50:01,071 --> 01:50:05,675
Since you're practically one of the
family, I'll let you in on my secret.

1355
01:50:05,839 --> 01:50:07,246
Honey.

1356
01:50:08,591 --> 01:50:09,932
I beg pardon?

1357
01:50:10,094 --> 01:50:12,647
Strained honey. That's the secret.

1358
01:50:13,934 --> 01:50:18,124
Of course, I use quite
a little rum too.

1359
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:27,244
Now, Mamie, I've made these
especially for you, dear.

1360
01:50:27,695 --> 01:50:31,044
Oh, my! Don't they look delicious?

1361
01:50:31,214 --> 01:50:34,346
Well, well, well.

1362
01:50:37,167 --> 01:50:39,622
What are they?

1363
01:50:39,791 --> 01:50:43,468
I put two cans of tuna fish
through the meat grinder...

1364
01:50:43,631 --> 01:50:46,413
...then add clam juice
and peanut butter.

1365
01:50:46,574 --> 01:50:49,029
<i>It's a recipe from
Ladies' Home Journal.</i>

1366
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:51,651
These are plain Jack
cheese and chutney.

1367
01:50:51,821 --> 01:50:56,076
Now, sit you down, Mamie.
I've something special to show you.

1368
01:50:56,236 --> 01:50:58,658
Baby pictures of Gloria?

1369
01:50:58,829 --> 01:51:01,382
The whole family, more or less.

1370
01:51:01,549 --> 01:51:04,844
On a bear rug. Isn't that precious?

1371
01:51:05,005 --> 01:51:08,321
Better not let Patrick see that one.

1372
01:51:14,316 --> 01:51:18,539
That's Miss Tuttail,
Little Glory's first school teacher.

1373
01:51:18,701 --> 01:51:21,319
I think the light
was hurting her eyes.

1374
01:51:21,484 --> 01:51:23,906
Enough of this girly-girly talk.

1375
01:51:24,076 --> 01:51:27,906
Since we have Mamie here,
we ought to let her know the plans.

1376
01:51:28,077 --> 01:51:29,964
Plans?
For Patrick's career.

1377
01:51:30,124 --> 01:51:32,513
Dwight Babcock and I
have that coordinated.

1378
01:51:32,685 --> 01:51:35,532
After the honeymoon,
I want Patrick to choose.

1379
01:51:35,692 --> 01:51:40,930
I can slip him into a berth on Madison
Avenue or a seat on the stock exchange.

1380
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:44,613
A seat and a berth...
Pardon me. I'm so sorry.

1381
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:50,050
Mamie, you're a pretty fast drinker.
Don't worry, I'm way ahead of you.

1382
01:51:50,221 --> 01:51:53,669
You don't happen to like gin, do you?
I adore it.

1383
01:51:53,836 --> 01:51:56,771
After dinner,
we'll get out the cards and play.

1384
01:51:56,941 --> 01:52:01,730
Now we come to the problem of the
wedding present. I have that settled.

1385
01:52:01,901 --> 01:52:03,843
Now, here's my idea, Mamie:

1386
01:52:04,013 --> 01:52:08,137
Why don't you and I get together
and buy the newlyweds that?

1387
01:52:08,332 --> 01:52:10,853
What?
That lot, right next door.

1388
01:52:11,085 --> 01:52:13,419
Wouldn't that make a wedding present?

1389
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:16,897
We could take out this wall
and join our patios.

1390
01:52:17,068 --> 01:52:19,589
You couldn't tell where one left off.

1391
01:52:19,756 --> 01:52:23,979
You wouldn't be losing a daughter.
You'd be gaining a patio.

1392
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:29,028
We gotta work fast. There's
people bidding on that property.

1393
01:52:29,196 --> 01:52:30,918
The wrong kind.

1394
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:33,733
A fellow named Epstein.
Abraham Epstein.

1395
01:52:33,898 --> 01:52:38,022
The cellist? How lucky you are.
All that glorious music next door!

1396
01:52:38,186 --> 01:52:39,975
And she's a darling.

1397
01:52:40,139 --> 01:52:43,587
I guess you don't understand
quite how it is here.

1398
01:52:43,754 --> 01:52:47,333
This section is restricted
only up to our property line.

1399
01:52:47,498 --> 01:52:50,498
We feel we have an obligation
to make sure...

1400
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:53,088
Well, you know.

1401
01:52:53,802 --> 01:52:57,992
I'll tell you what. I'll buy it
and we'll divvy it up 50-50.

1402
01:52:58,154 --> 01:53:01,450
You won't have to worry about a thing.

1403
01:53:05,963 --> 01:53:08,167
My, my, my.

1404
01:53:08,618 --> 01:53:11,204
You've thought of everything,
haven't you?

1405
01:53:11,371 --> 01:53:13,673
Laid out Patrick's career.

1406
01:53:13,835 --> 01:53:16,039
Planned the wedding.

1407
01:53:16,811 --> 01:53:20,226
Even chosen my gift.

1408
01:53:22,219 --> 01:53:26,081
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left for me to do.

1409
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:27,559
What's that?

1410
01:53:27,723 --> 01:53:32,774
When you get back from Prickly Pines,
I'll give an intimate family dinner.

1411
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:35,622
Well, how about that?

1412
01:53:35,786 --> 01:53:38,688
Say, you're a good scout, Mamie.

1413
01:53:38,859 --> 01:53:42,055
By golly, you're top drawer!

1414
01:53:53,259 --> 01:53:56,554
Well, that's a very
interesting design...

1415
01:53:56,714 --> 01:54:00,424
...but are you sure you planned it
with that end up?

1416
01:54:03,147 --> 01:54:08,002
That is the beauty of it, madam.
It can be used upside down.

1417
01:54:27,753 --> 01:54:30,567
Just leave it outside, please.

1418
01:54:31,849 --> 01:54:34,783
I'm so sorry.
You must be Patrick Dennis.

1419
01:54:34,952 --> 01:54:37,538
Guilty. Are you guilty of all of this?

1420
01:54:37,705 --> 01:54:41,567
I'm not the decorator. I'm your
aunt's secretary, Pegeen Ryan.

1421
01:54:41,736 --> 01:54:44,257
How do you do?
Hello.

1422
01:54:45,641 --> 01:54:48,739
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I was away all summer.

1423
01:54:48,904 --> 01:54:51,904
A lot of changes here.
Leave it to Auntie Mame.

1424
01:54:52,072 --> 01:54:56,000
Where'd she get this stuff?
It's the only set in the universe.

1425
01:54:56,168 --> 01:55:00,129
It's made by the famous
Danish designer, Yul Uhlu.

1426
01:55:00,297 --> 01:55:02,020
Who?

1427
01:55:02,184 --> 01:55:05,217
Yul Uhlu.

1428
01:55:05,384 --> 01:55:08,832
Say that to the right fella
and you'll get kissed.

1429
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:14,241
Incidentally, congratulations.
I hear you're getting married.

1430
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:17,474
A week from next Tuesday.
The old ball and chain.

1431
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:21,502
I wish I had said that. Or,
"The first 100 years are the hardest."

1432
01:55:21,673 --> 01:55:25,251
Good one. How about,
"Marriage is a great institution"?

1433
01:55:25,417 --> 01:55:29,159
"Yeah, but who wants
to be in an institution?"

1434
01:55:31,017 --> 01:55:33,602
Well, that's enough of that.

1435
01:55:33,768 --> 01:55:37,762
Patrick. Patrick, my little love!

1436
01:55:39,465 --> 01:55:43,359
I'm glad to see you. Did you have
a good time at Upson Pines?

1437
01:55:43,528 --> 01:55:46,496
I had a wonderful time.
What is the idea of...?

1438
01:55:46,664 --> 01:55:50,918
Not now. I have to go to Montebank.
They adored you but...

1439
01:55:51,079 --> 01:55:55,389
I'm so relieved. I want everything
to be extra special tonight...

1440
01:55:55,558 --> 01:55:58,787
...and give the Upsons
as cozy a time as they gave me.

1441
01:55:58,951 --> 01:56:01,406
Now, Pegeen, dear...
I forgot the horror.

1442
01:56:01,574 --> 01:56:04,608
Will someone help me with the ladder?
Of course.

1443
01:56:04,775 --> 01:56:09,477
Fish food. Where's the fish food?
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

1444
01:56:09,638 --> 01:56:13,380
Don't nibble on the hors d'oeuvres.
You'll get fat.

1445
01:56:13,542 --> 01:56:18,660
I'm sorry, Mrs. Burnside.
I try to do exactly as you say.

1446
01:56:18,823 --> 01:56:22,500
Come and get it.
Come along, come along.

1447
01:56:22,694 --> 01:56:24,669
You're so wonderful.

1448
01:56:24,838 --> 01:56:28,515
Nobody else would've taken me in,
an outcast of society.

1449
01:56:28,678 --> 01:56:33,500
I'm grateful! You've given me a new
interest, now that I'm losing Patrick.

1450
01:56:33,671 --> 01:56:37,664
I wish I had someone to look after.
You will, dear, you will.

1451
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:42,053
Where do you want this set up?
Right there will be fine.

1452
01:56:42,982 --> 01:56:46,113
What's that supposed to be?
You don't like it?

1453
01:56:46,278 --> 01:56:49,595
It might be a little avant-garde
for the Upsons.

1454
01:56:49,766 --> 01:56:53,411
Take it right down.
I want everything to be perfect.

1455
01:56:53,575 --> 01:56:58,212
I think it's very unusual.
Agnes! What is she doing here?

1456
01:56:58,375 --> 01:57:02,881
Where else, in her condition?
The Upsons will not understand.

1457
01:57:03,046 --> 01:57:06,243
Perhaps they won't notice.
Won't notice?

1458
01:57:06,407 --> 01:57:08,349
They're here. They're here.

1459
01:57:08,518 --> 01:57:11,300
Help me get this down.
Help her, darling.

1460
01:57:11,463 --> 01:57:16,219
Leave it. Get the ladder out of here.
Norah, lto, somebody answer the door!

1461
01:57:16,390 --> 01:57:18,245
I'll get it.
No, you don't!

1462
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:23,425
He's right. Go and stay in your room.
But what will I do?

1463
01:57:23,591 --> 01:57:29,603
Sleep, knit, start making up names:
Rudolph, Abigail, Beulah, anything.

1464
01:57:40,068 --> 01:57:43,581
Welcome to the Burnside fireside.

1465
01:57:43,749 --> 01:57:47,294
How I have looked forward
to this evening! Come in.

1466
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:52,130
And Claude.
Good to see you, Mamie!

1467
01:57:52,293 --> 01:57:55,871
And little Glory.
I'm so pleased to see you again.

1468
01:57:56,036 --> 01:57:57,410
Yes, dear.

1469
01:57:58,820 --> 01:58:00,959
Say!

1470
01:58:01,124 --> 01:58:04,027
My, my, my, my, my!

1471
01:58:04,196 --> 01:58:08,474
Hi, everybody.
Well, hello, son.

1472
01:58:08,868 --> 01:58:10,940
Patrick.

1473
01:58:11,108 --> 01:58:15,385
Gloria.
I made up a joke on the way up.

1474
01:58:15,556 --> 01:58:16,669
Listen to this:

1475
01:58:16,836 --> 01:58:22,074
Why is an elevator man's job
like my place in Connecticut?

1476
01:58:22,244 --> 01:58:25,310
Give up?
Almost.

1477
01:58:25,476 --> 01:58:30,179
I'll tell you. Because it has
its ups and down.

1478
01:58:30,341 --> 01:58:32,675
You get it? Upson Downs!

1479
01:58:35,204 --> 01:58:39,677
Clever. Clever.
Oh, well.

1480
01:58:39,844 --> 01:58:42,593
Do sit down.
Thank you.

1481
01:58:44,292 --> 01:58:49,409
Doris, you're not comfortable.
These are all marvelously adjustable.

1482
01:58:49,572 --> 01:58:53,053
This is the master control.
Each chair has its cord.

1483
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:57,760
Now, let me see, Doris.
You are number four. Now, here we go.

1484
01:59:00,868 --> 01:59:03,650
So sorry, Claude, you are number four.

1485
01:59:03,812 --> 01:59:06,201
Doris, you must be number five.

1486
01:59:06,372 --> 01:59:12,087
Patrick, you're confusing me.
Doris, here you are. Five, going up.

1487
01:59:12,258 --> 01:59:13,982
There we go.

1488
01:59:16,419 --> 01:59:18,906
Isn't it wonderful?
So easy to sweep under.

1489
01:59:19,074 --> 01:59:23,351
Claude, here we go. Hang on
to your seat belts. Down we go.

1490
01:59:23,522 --> 01:59:27,264
My, what supple legs you have.
You must have studied yoga.

1491
01:59:27,426 --> 01:59:29,532
Here are the drinks.

1492
01:59:29,698 --> 01:59:32,317
So sorry, Doris dear.

1493
01:59:32,483 --> 01:59:38,429
Going down to the main floor.
Cigars, cigarettes, lingerie, hardware.

1494
01:59:42,402 --> 01:59:44,922
Well, now, Patrick.

1495
01:59:45,571 --> 01:59:48,669
And little Glory.

1496
01:59:49,474 --> 01:59:51,416
And here's Uncle Dwight.

1497
01:59:51,586 --> 01:59:54,782
Claude.
Dwight!

1498
01:59:54,946 --> 01:59:57,085
Well, how are you?

1499
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,967
Mr. Babcock.
Mrs. Burnside.

1500
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:03,032
We must have that game of golf soon.

1501
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:05,595
My, my, my, my, my.

1502
02:00:05,762 --> 02:00:11,513
We'll have to take that up a bit.
Pegeen, better bring the ladder again.

1503
02:00:11,682 --> 02:00:14,464
Won't you sit down, Mr. Babcock?
Thank you.

1504
02:00:14,946 --> 02:00:18,394
<i>They're almost ready.
The spécialité de la maison.</i>

1505
02:00:18,562 --> 02:00:22,174
I want you to meet Miss Pegeen Ryan.
How do you do?

1506
02:00:22,338 --> 02:00:25,753
Take it up. It seems to be
getting in peoples' hair.

1507
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:29,883
Claude.
Thank you.

1508
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:32,254
And Doris.

1509
02:00:32,418 --> 02:00:37,087
Claude, I'm not going to tell you
one thing that's in these drinks...

1510
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:41,757
...because all the ingredients
are secret.

1511
02:00:41,922 --> 02:00:44,769
Now, now, now, just hang on.

1512
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:49,625
Well, what do you know?

1513
02:00:49,794 --> 02:00:52,377
The trick is to drink them up fast...

1514
02:00:52,544 --> 02:00:56,188
...before all the alcohol burns away.

1515
02:00:57,376 --> 02:01:02,231
Don't you worry about a thing, Claude.
I'm fully covered by fire insurance.

1516
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:08,026
Well, now, Patrick. Here.
And little Glory.

1517
02:01:08,192 --> 02:01:11,869
My friend who may drop in later
calls it the Flaming Mame.

1518
02:01:12,032 --> 02:01:15,479
Who? Who is coming?
Just family, darling.

1519
02:01:18,112 --> 02:01:22,651
Don't be a scaredy-cat.
There's nothing to be frightened of.

1520
02:01:22,816 --> 02:01:24,889
There, now.

1521
02:01:25,184 --> 02:01:27,224
Are we all lit?

1522
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,961
Mr. Upson, can I fix you a daiquiri?
No. Not for a minute.

1523
02:01:32,128 --> 02:01:36,122
Your Aunt Mamie made this for me,
and I'm gonna drink it.

1524
02:01:36,288 --> 02:01:38,709
It looks just fine.

1525
02:01:42,816 --> 02:01:46,199
This is spicy.
Try one of the striped ones, Mums.

1526
02:01:46,368 --> 02:01:48,921
These are tasty.
What are they, dear?

1527
02:01:49,088 --> 02:01:52,666
Just plain old pickled rattlesnake.

1528
02:01:59,488 --> 02:02:03,383
Pure protein. They're marinated
after they remove the fangs.

1529
02:02:03,552 --> 02:02:05,375
Mr. Babcock, you've gone out.

1530
02:02:05,536 --> 02:02:08,732
Don't bother, Mrs. Burnside.

1531
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:14,142
Agnes.

1532
02:02:14,464 --> 02:02:18,774
Agnes, I told you to stay
in your room.

1533
02:02:18,944 --> 02:02:22,239
But it's a quarter past 8,
and you told me...

1534
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:25,696
I told you to take your pills
a quarter past 8.

1535
02:02:25,856 --> 02:02:30,872
My calcium pills are in the kitchen.
Now, now, come, dear.

1536
02:02:31,326 --> 02:02:34,839
Is that a member of the family?
Darned if I know.

1537
02:02:35,006 --> 02:02:38,803
It's a member of somebody's family.

1538
02:02:42,526 --> 02:02:47,447
I would like you to meet my former
secretary. She's a little bit...

1539
02:02:47,614 --> 02:02:49,981
She's not quite herself
at the moment.

1540
02:02:50,302 --> 02:02:54,328
Now, we know all about these
women's things, don't we?

1541
02:02:54,494 --> 02:02:58,454
What's your name, dear?
Gooch.

1542
02:02:59,070 --> 02:03:03,161
You sit right over here
beside me, Mrs. Gooch.

1543
02:03:22,462 --> 02:03:24,796
And what does Mr. Gooch do?

1544
02:03:24,957 --> 02:03:28,503
Oh, my father passed on.

1545
02:03:28,734 --> 02:03:32,312
Oh, no. I mean your husband.

1546
02:03:33,758 --> 02:03:38,744
Now, now, Agnes. Upsy-daisy.
Calcium time, darling.

1547
02:03:39,006 --> 02:03:40,948
Pegeen, dear.

1548
02:03:41,118 --> 02:03:46,301
Auntie Mame is big-hearted
when anybody is in trouble.

1549
02:03:46,462 --> 02:03:48,437
I can see that.

1550
02:03:48,605 --> 02:03:52,151
Vera and Lindsay.
Mame, darling.

1551
02:03:52,318 --> 02:03:55,417
Like an opening night without critics.

1552
02:03:55,582 --> 02:04:00,338
I'd like you to meet
my dearest friend, Vera Charles.

1553
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:03,805
And the well-known publisher,
Mr. Lindsay Woolsey.

1554
02:04:03,965 --> 02:04:07,282
I'm charmed to meet you,
all of you.

1555
02:04:07,454 --> 02:04:10,899
<i>I've got to tell you,
I adored you in Mary of Scotland.</i>

1556
02:04:11,068 --> 02:04:14,963
Did you, dear? That was Helen Hayes.

1557
02:04:15,483 --> 02:04:17,306
Spirits!

1558
02:04:17,468 --> 02:04:20,566
Vera, can I persuade you
to have a drink?

1559
02:04:20,732 --> 02:04:23,732
Yes, dear. Anything but rum.

1560
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:26,617
I've just been
to the most awful party...

1561
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:30,609
...where they served nothing
but daiquiris made with honey.

1562
02:04:32,604 --> 02:04:35,474
Mame!
Acacius, darling.

1563
02:04:37,724 --> 02:04:39,731
Oh, Lord!

1564
02:04:40,028 --> 02:04:42,297
Mr. and Mrs. Upson, Mr. Babcock...

1565
02:04:42,459 --> 02:04:47,129
...l'd like you to meet Acacius Page,
Patrick's first teacher in New York.

1566
02:04:47,292 --> 02:04:51,569
The man who had a great deal
to do with molding his character.

1567
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:54,260
Haven't we met before?

1568
02:04:54,428 --> 02:04:57,462
I don't recognize the face.

1569
02:05:03,868 --> 02:05:06,202
Acacius, darling, your lotus juice.

1570
02:05:06,363 --> 02:05:08,403
Auntie Mame.
Yes, dear.

1571
02:05:08,572 --> 02:05:12,827
I thought this was a family night.
This is our family.

1572
02:05:12,988 --> 02:05:16,697
Pegeen, are you having trouble?
Help her, please.

1573
02:05:17,084 --> 02:05:19,255
Thank you.

1574
02:05:22,908 --> 02:05:25,591
Thanks, Lochinvar.
Courtesy of the house.

1575
02:05:25,756 --> 02:05:29,618
I'm fine. You have enough problems.
Don't I, though?

1576
02:05:29,788 --> 02:05:32,505
That's a pretty picture, I must say.

1577
02:05:32,668 --> 02:05:37,076
Yes, isn't it? Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to propose a toast.

1578
02:05:37,276 --> 02:05:39,316
To this lovely young couple...

1579
02:05:39,484 --> 02:05:43,510
...as they start up
the ladder of life together.

1580
02:05:44,028 --> 02:05:48,370
Oh, no, Auntie Vera.
This isn't Gloria. That's Gloria.

1581
02:05:48,924 --> 02:05:50,678
Pity.

1582
02:05:53,657 --> 02:05:55,861
I brought you something.
What is it?

1583
02:05:56,025 --> 02:05:59,342
Be careful. The ink's wet.
My book!

1584
02:05:59,513 --> 02:06:02,066
I'm in print. Just like Edna Ferber.

1585
02:06:02,234 --> 02:06:04,787
You did it. I never knew
you went on with it.

1586
02:06:04,954 --> 02:06:08,150
Patrick, you have vision.
Mame, he's just like you.

1587
02:06:08,313 --> 02:06:12,110
My lifesaver, Patrick, and Lindsay.
This has been a great day.

1588
02:06:12,282 --> 02:06:15,665
Patrick, why didn't you tell me
your aunt was literate?

1589
02:06:16,089 --> 02:06:20,596
Am I mentioned in your book?
Mentioned? You're exposed!

1590
02:06:20,793 --> 02:06:24,787
<i>A toast to Live, Live, Live
by Mame Dennis Burnside.</i>

1591
02:06:25,177 --> 02:06:29,138
Step right up now,
and get your red hot chapters!

1592
02:06:29,306 --> 02:06:32,851
I've been to so many
wonderful parties here, Mame.

1593
02:06:33,017 --> 02:06:35,406
Now I'll see how they all ended.

1594
02:06:35,578 --> 02:06:40,761
I forgot about that time we almost got
caught in a speakeasy. I was 10.

1595
02:06:41,242 --> 02:06:44,722
Here's all about the roller skates
and Uncle Beau.

1596
02:06:44,889 --> 02:06:48,238
And that Christmas we were so broke.

1597
02:06:48,633 --> 02:06:52,146
Patrick, my little Patrick.

1598
02:06:52,665 --> 02:06:57,367
You can practically write a whole book
about what happened to me.

1599
02:06:57,817 --> 02:06:59,378
I beg your pardon?

1600
02:06:59,578 --> 02:07:03,407
I said, you can write a whole book
about what happened to me.

1601
02:07:03,577 --> 02:07:05,039
Thank you.
Yes.

1602
02:07:05,209 --> 02:07:09,617
Bunny Bixler and I were in the
semifinals, the very semifinals...

1603
02:07:09,786 --> 02:07:12,536
...of the Ping-Pong tournament
at the club.

1604
02:07:12,698 --> 02:07:15,251
And this ghastly thing happened.

1605
02:07:15,418 --> 02:07:21,528
We were both playing way over
our heads and the score was 29-28.

1606
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:23,828
We had this terrific volley...

1607
02:07:23,993 --> 02:07:28,532
...and I stepped back
to get this really terrific shot.

1608
02:07:28,697 --> 02:07:34,292
And I stepped on the Ping-Pong ball.

1609
02:07:35,096 --> 02:07:38,096
I just squashed it to bits.

1610
02:07:38,264 --> 02:07:42,639
And then Bunny and I ran to the closet
to get another ball.

1611
02:07:42,808 --> 02:07:46,288
And the closet was locked. Imagine?

1612
02:07:46,456 --> 02:07:50,929
We had to call the whole thing off.

1613
02:07:51,831 --> 02:07:54,515
Well, it was ghastly.

1614
02:07:55,512 --> 02:07:58,927
Well, it was just ghastly.

1615
02:08:05,592 --> 02:08:09,421
Well, it was amusing.
Yes, yes.

1616
02:08:11,576 --> 02:08:14,259
It's hilarious!

1617
02:08:14,423 --> 02:08:17,271
What is?
Your story.

1618
02:08:20,439 --> 02:08:25,589
I'm so proud. The whole
last chapter's all about me.

1619
02:08:25,816 --> 02:08:28,980
"Fighting the stigma...

1620
02:08:29,144 --> 02:08:33,715
...of the unwed mother."

1621
02:08:38,423 --> 02:08:40,311
Mr. Upson, you lucky devil.

1622
02:08:40,472 --> 02:08:45,207
Your future son-in-law is featured in
one of the raciest books of the year.

1623
02:08:45,368 --> 02:08:49,972
Patrick, I had no idea how many times
you unzipped me and put me to bed.

1624
02:08:50,135 --> 02:08:52,950
Now, just a minute!
There are young people here.

1625
02:08:53,112 --> 02:08:57,618
I only did it when Miss Charles
had passed out.

1626
02:09:02,456 --> 02:09:03,568
Thank you, lto.

1627
02:09:03,735 --> 02:09:07,347
Don't tell me she can't come.
Who can't come?

1628
02:09:07,512 --> 02:09:11,471
That woman with the snakes from Paris.
She was to entertain us.

1629
02:09:11,638 --> 02:09:13,328
Vera, loan me your glasses.

1630
02:09:13,493 --> 02:09:16,210
"Read a forthcoming publication
of our book.

1631
02:09:16,373 --> 02:09:21,491
I'm entitled to half of the royalties
for services as editor and co-author..."

1632
02:09:21,654 --> 02:09:23,345
Brian!

1633
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:24,819
Brian?

1634
02:09:25,398 --> 02:09:30,002
"Will return in a few days
to claim fruits of collaboration.

1635
02:09:30,838 --> 02:09:35,213
My claim will be substantiated
by my wife, Agnes Gooch O'Bannion."

1636
02:09:35,382 --> 02:09:36,527
Wife?

1637
02:09:36,694 --> 02:09:39,312
Think, Agnes, think.
Think?

1638
02:09:39,478 --> 02:09:41,103
Try!

1639
02:09:43,638 --> 02:09:47,053
Maybe that wasn't a movie we went to.

1640
02:09:47,222 --> 02:09:51,728
Maybe that wasn't Gary Cooper.
It was Brian.

1641
02:09:51,893 --> 02:09:54,315
And the girl was...

1642
02:09:55,669 --> 02:09:57,458
...me!

1643
02:09:57,622 --> 02:10:01,037
I'm a bride!
Oh, darling, congratulations.

1644
02:10:01,206 --> 02:10:03,410
Isn't it wonderful, Patrick?

1645
02:10:03,574 --> 02:10:06,922
I'm so happy for you!
Honey, isn't this terrific?

1646
02:10:07,093 --> 02:10:10,476
This is revolting.
How can you tolerate people who...?

1647
02:10:10,645 --> 02:10:12,882
Who aren't absolutely top drawer?

1648
02:10:13,046 --> 02:10:15,729
These are my friends.
People who brought me up.

1649
02:10:15,893 --> 02:10:20,116
Riffraff! When we're married,
don't invite such people to our house.

1650
02:10:20,277 --> 02:10:25,099
Who'll be coming? Bunny, Muriel Puce?
What's wrong with Muriel Puce?

1651
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:29,580
She has the IQ of a dead battery.
As for your other girlfriends...

1652
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:33,197
...they're a lot of vain,
selfish, empty bigots.

1653
02:10:36,245 --> 02:10:39,344
Marvelous! You'll make
a fortune out of this book.

1654
02:10:39,510 --> 02:10:41,484
She will, but not for herself.

1655
02:10:41,653 --> 02:10:44,915
She gave her royalties
to the Epstein Home in Montebank.

1656
02:10:45,078 --> 02:10:48,013
Epstein the cellist?
What about Montebank?

1657
02:10:48,181 --> 02:10:51,562
Can't the Epsteins afford
their own home?

1658
02:10:51,732 --> 02:10:54,066
They're not going to live there.

1659
02:10:54,227 --> 02:10:58,417
They're building a home there
for refugee Jewish children.

1660
02:10:58,964 --> 02:11:01,898
What's that?!
Oh, no!

1661
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:05,769
Jackpot!

1662
02:11:09,235 --> 02:11:13,490
Pegeen, call Denmark quick
and get ahold of Yul Uhlu!

1663
02:11:19,572 --> 02:11:20,913
Are you all right, Doris?

1664
02:11:22,291 --> 02:11:23,339
You ready?

1665
02:11:23,507 --> 02:11:27,599
I've been ready for quite some time.
Come, Glory!

1666
02:11:27,764 --> 02:11:29,389
You...!

1667
02:11:31,059 --> 02:11:35,980
Claude! Claude! Don't be hasty.

1668
02:11:44,627 --> 02:11:49,450
For 9 years, Mame Dennis Burnside,
I have done everything in my power...

1669
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:53,743
...to protect this boy from
your idiotic, cockeyed nincompoopery!

1670
02:11:53,907 --> 02:11:57,519
Now you've ruined everything.
All my plans for Patrick...!

1671
02:11:57,684 --> 02:12:03,565
Your plans!
You're shouting orders for everyone.

1672
02:12:03,732 --> 02:12:06,928
Did it occur to you
this boy might be hungry...

1673
02:12:07,091 --> 02:12:09,611
...for something
you've never heard of?

1674
02:12:10,164 --> 02:12:13,098
When Patrick first walked
into my life...

1675
02:12:13,267 --> 02:12:15,853
...a frightened little boy...

1676
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:19,216
...hanging on to Norah's hand...

1677
02:12:20,468 --> 02:12:23,566
...it was love at first sight.

1678
02:12:24,083 --> 02:12:27,247
For 9 years I've tried
to open windows in his life.

1679
02:12:27,411 --> 02:12:30,126
You want to shut him up
in a safe deposit box.

1680
02:12:30,289 --> 02:12:32,875
I won't let you do that
to my little one.

1681
02:12:34,801 --> 02:12:36,525
Oh, no.

1682
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:41,006
He's not little anymore.

1683
02:12:42,898 --> 02:12:46,509
And he's not mine.
But he's not yours, Mr. Babcock.

1684
02:12:46,673 --> 02:12:51,081
Patrick won't let you settle him down
in a restricted community...

1685
02:12:51,249 --> 02:12:53,388
...make him an Aryan from Darien...

1686
02:12:53,554 --> 02:12:57,198
...and marry him off to a girl
with braces on her brains.

1687
02:13:07,377 --> 02:13:11,687
Mame, did you deliberately
plan all this?

1688
02:13:12,849 --> 02:13:18,119
Don't be ridiculous. Patrick always
makes all his own decisions.

1689
02:13:18,289 --> 02:13:21,039
Rattlesnake, anyone?

1690
02:13:26,802 --> 02:13:28,940
Thank you...

1691
02:13:29,777 --> 02:13:32,461
...Lady Iris.

1692
02:13:33,617 --> 02:13:35,625
Charmed...

1693
02:13:36,785 --> 02:13:39,338
...Lord Dudley.

1694
02:13:46,641 --> 02:13:50,219
<i>Punjab, India. June 28, 1946.</i>

1695
02:13:50,385 --> 02:13:54,215
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Dennis,
224 E. 50th Street, New York.</i>

1696
02:13:54,385 --> 02:13:57,964
<i>Dear Patrick and Pegeen:
Arriving from India, June 31.</i>

1697
02:13:58,130 --> 02:14:00,169
<i>Meet me Beekman Place apartment.</i>

1698
02:14:00,337 --> 02:14:02,541
<i>Must return India in two weeks...</i>

1699
02:14:02,705 --> 02:14:06,982
<i>... when Uncle Lindsay will have
finished his course in yoga.</i>

1700
02:14:42,192 --> 02:14:46,763
What were you doing in there?
Just giving Michael his presents.

1701
02:14:46,927 --> 02:14:49,229
Look, Dad. Which is the front?

1702
02:14:49,391 --> 02:14:53,668
Oh, my little love, let me help you.
There, now.

1703
02:14:53,839 --> 02:14:57,636
Salaam for your mother
like Auntie Mame just taught you.

1704
02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:01,487
Very good, sahib.

1705
02:15:01,647 --> 02:15:05,869
That's not a real sword, is it?
It's a scimitar.

1706
02:15:07,823 --> 02:15:09,481
That's what I always say.

1707
02:15:09,999 --> 02:15:14,090
In Hindustani it means, "The
water oxen are waiting at the gate."

1708
02:15:14,255 --> 02:15:20,201
My water oxen's waiting at Idlewild,
Pan American flight 100 for Karachi.

1709
02:15:20,367 --> 02:15:24,077
Michael, if I could only
show you India.

1710
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:26,792
The color, the splendor, the mystery.

1711
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:31,400
The elephants in the street...
Now, Auntie Mame.

1712
02:15:33,103 --> 02:15:34,761
I know, I know.

1713
02:15:34,927 --> 02:15:39,848
I shouldn't mention the possibility
of Michael going to India with me.

1714
02:15:40,015 --> 02:15:43,463
Auntie Mame said she'd love
to have me. She said so in there.

1715
02:15:43,632 --> 02:15:47,309
That's ridiculous. I won't hear of it.
Dad?

1716
02:15:47,472 --> 02:15:50,885
It's out of the question.
You heard your mother.

1717
02:15:54,894 --> 02:15:58,570
You know what your trouble is?
You don't live, live, live!

1718
02:15:58,734 --> 02:16:03,305
Life is a banquet and most poor
suckers are starving to death.

1719
02:16:17,582 --> 02:16:19,524
One thing you must remember:

1720
02:16:19,693 --> 02:16:23,752
School begins the day after Labor Day.
He must be back by then.

1721
02:16:23,917 --> 02:16:26,600
Naturally.

1722
02:16:27,277 --> 02:16:29,481
Of course.

1723
02:16:29,710 --> 02:16:34,947
Labor Day. That's sometime
in November, isn't it?

1724
02:16:35,118 --> 02:16:37,835
The first week in September,
Auntie Mame.

1725
02:16:37,998 --> 02:16:41,794
Labor. The problem of labor
in India is gargantuan.

1726
02:16:41,965 --> 02:16:44,038
What's "gargantuan," Auntie Mame?

1727
02:16:44,205 --> 02:16:46,922
On the plane, I'll give you
a pad and pencil...

1728
02:16:47,085 --> 02:16:50,119
...to write down all the words
you don't understand.

1729
02:16:50,285 --> 02:16:53,897
I've been out shopping all morning
for your traveling gear.

1730
02:16:54,093 --> 02:16:57,257
Let's go upstairs and try things on.

1731
02:16:57,421 --> 02:17:01,861
Oh, Michael, I'm going
to open doors for you.

1732
02:17:02,029 --> 02:17:05,226
Doors you never even dreamed existed.

1733
02:17:05,645 --> 02:17:08,460
I give up. She's the pied piper.

1734
02:17:08,621 --> 02:17:11,206
Oh, what times we're going to have!

1735
02:17:11,373 --> 02:17:14,602
What vistas we're going
to explore together.

1736
02:17:14,765 --> 02:17:17,733
We'll spend a day at
an ancient Hindu temple.

1737
02:17:17,901 --> 02:17:20,290
The head monk is Auntie Mame's friend.

1738
02:17:20,461 --> 02:17:24,552
Perhaps he'll let you ring the bells
that bring the monks to prayer.

1739
02:17:24,717 --> 02:17:29,092
There, on the highest tower on a
clear day, you can see the Taj Mahal.

1740
02:17:29,261 --> 02:17:31,114
Beyond that is a beautiful...
