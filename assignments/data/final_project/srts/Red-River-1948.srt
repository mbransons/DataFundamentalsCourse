1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,420
ANNIE.

3
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,170
OH...

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,767
BOY--
WHO ARE YA?

5
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:59,206
BOY! CAN YA HEAR ME?

6
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,859
ANSWER ME, SON.

7
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:06,604
DON'T YOU EVER
DO THAT AGAIN.

8
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,216
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SON.
YOU CAN PUT THE GUN AWAY.

9
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,826
WHAT HAPPENED, SON?

10
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,046
I SAW MY PA...

11
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,310
AND MY MA...

12
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,225
DEAD.

13
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,795
LET'S GO.

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,450
WITH YOU?

15
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,676
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

16
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,594
THIS IT IT.

17
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,509
EVERYTHING A MAN
COULD WANT--

18
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:28,947
GOOD WATER, GRASS,

19
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,254
PLENTY OF LAND.

20
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,214
WHO'S IT BELONG TO?

21
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,693
ME.

22
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,434
START A FIRE.

23
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:41,264
MAKE TWO LINES LIKE THIS
FOR THE BANKS OF A RIVER,

24
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,266
AND THE LETTER "D."

25
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,746
YEAH.

26
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,795
YOU GONNA PUT THAT BRAND
ON MY COW, TOO?

27
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,841
WELL, EVERY BULL
NEEDS A COW, MATTHEW.

28
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:55,670
UNLESS YOU KNOW
A BETTER WAY
TO START A HERD

29
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,672
THAT'S SOMEDAY GONNA
STRETCH OUT HERE

30
00:03:57,715 --> 00:04:00,152
AS FAR THE EYE CAN SEE.

31
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:04,069
I SEE A "D" FOR "DUNSON"
ON THAT BRAND.

32
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:07,725
BUT THAT'S MY COW.
WHERE'S THE "M" FOR "MATTHEW"?

33
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,250
I'LL PUT IT ON THERE
WHEN YOU'VE EARNED IT.

34
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,383
FAIR ENOUGH.
I'LL EARN IT.

35
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:20,390
Matthew:
THEY'RE GONNA GET AWAY!

36
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:23,741
Dunson:
WHEREVER THEY GO,
IT'LL BE ON MY LAND.

37
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,295
Cowboy:
COME ON, COME ON!

38
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:26,647
COME ON!

39
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,782
GET HIM ON THE HEAD,
LOREDO.

40
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:34,959
Man:
STILL DON'T SEE AN "M"
ON THAT BRAND.

41
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,402
I'LL PUT AN "M" ON THERE
WHEN YOU EARNED IT.

42
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,752
FAIR ENOUGH.

43
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,799
WELCOME HOME, MATT.HEY, BUSTER. TAYLOR.

44
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:51,454
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
YOU'RE HOME!

45
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:52,977
AND IN ONE PIECE!

46
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,849
LOOK AT HIM!
LOOK AT HIM!

47
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,851
I'VE SEEN MORE MEAT
ON A JACKRABBIT!

48
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:58,592
I FIGURE THOSE
SOURDOUGH BISCUITS
OF YOURS

49
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,115
SHOULD FIX ME UP.

50
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,899
HOW YA BEEN,
YA OLD COOT?
HA HA HA!

51
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:04,336
NEVER BETTER,
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

52
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,383
WELL, JUST DON'T STAND THERE
AFTER FOUR YEARS, DUNSON.

53
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,777
SAY SOMETHING!WHY?

54
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,996
YOU USED UP ALL THE WORDS.

55
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,830
'BOUT TIME YOU SHOWED UP.

56
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,834
THERE IT IS, MATTHEW.

57
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:27,708
YOUR COW AND MY BULL
PRODUCED THE LARGEST HERD
IN SOUTH TEXAS.

58
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:30,885
WHERE THEY STAND,
THEY'RE NOT WORTH
A PLUGGED 3-CENT PIECE.

59
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,930
WHAT HAPPENED?YANKEES.

60
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,585
THE WAR SUCKED ALL THE GOLD
OUT OF THE SOUTH.

61
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,847
LAST YEAR
TOM SWEATED BULLETS

62
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,936
TO FILL
ARMY BEEF CONTRACTS.

63
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,895
AND WHAT'S HE GOT
TO SHOW FOR IT?

64
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,505
CONFEDERATE PAPER MONEY

65
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,812
YOU CAN'T EVEN USE
TO LIGHT A DUTCH OVEN WITH.

66
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,727
DID I TELL YOU
TO BELLYACHE FOR ME?

67
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,730
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE SAID
THEY AIN'T WORTH A PLUGGED
3-CENT PIECE!

68
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,862
YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT,
IT SOUNDS WORSE.

69
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,951
THAT'S 'CAUSE
IT ISWORSE!

70
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:56,084
THE ONLY CASH MARKET LEFT
IS YANKEE LAND

71
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,652
WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD
TO CELEBRATE WHUPPIN' US

72
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:01,002
OVER A GOOD TEXAS STEAK.

73
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:04,701
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN
DRIVING 'EM A THOUSAND MILES

74
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:07,051
THROUGH THE DEVIL'S OWN HELL.

75
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:10,185
NOBODY BUT TOM DUNSON'D GET
SUCH A FOOL NOTION IN HIS HEAD.

76
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:13,623
THE FIRST HERD
THAT GETS TO THAT TRAILHEAD
IS GONNA BRING TOP DOLLAR.

77
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,407
AND JUST BECAUSE
NOBODY'S DONE IT

78
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:18,715
DOESN'T MEAN
IT CAN'T BE DONE.

79
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,762
I'VE PUT TOO MUCH WORK
INTO THIS THING TO LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO IT NOW.

80
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,068
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES
WHO ARE GONNA TRY TO BE FIRST.

81
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,722
WE CAN'T WAIT
MUCH LONGER.

82
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,332
HE NEEDS ANOTHER DAY
TO ROUND 'EM UP.

83
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:29,073
I FIGURE SAN SABA
TO MERIDIAN,

84
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,727
THEN ALONG THE BRAZOS.

85
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:33,730
THE WAR DIDN'T
TEACH HIM EVERYTHING.

86
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,819
YOUR WAY IS 60 MILES LONGER.

87
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,865
I PATROLLED THAT COUNTRY
DURING THE RIVER CAMPAIGN.

88
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,302
THERE'S GOOD WATER
CLEAR TO THE RED.

89
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,827
ONE WAY TO SETTLE IT.

90
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:52,967
DRAW!

91
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,099
HA HA HA!

92
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,840
OH HO!
HE BEAT YA, TOM!

93
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,973
HE BEAT YA!
FIRST TIME!

94
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:02,150
THE BOY IS A MAN!
AND JUST A MITE FASTER.

95
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:05,588
HAVEN'T HEARD THAT CALL
IN A LOT OF YEARS.

96
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:10,811
THIS, UH..COUNTRY YOU CLAIM
TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT...

97
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:14,292
MAKE A MAP.

98
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,687
ALREADY HAVE.

99
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,691
YOU'RE A MITE FASTER
'BOUT A LOT OF THINGS.

100
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,781
THIS THE FIRST TIME
IN FOUR YEARS

101
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,566
I'VE SEEN THAT MAN
REALLY SMILE.

102
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:37,794
MATT! THE NEXT ONE'S
A MEEKER!

103
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,013
LET HIM GO.

104
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,537
MR. DUNSON SAID
TO BRAND EVERYTHING.

105
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,626
ISAID, TURN HIM LOOSE!

106
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,281
PUT A BRAND
ON HIM.

107
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:51,634
HE'S WEARING
A MEEKER IRON.

108
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,723
I CAN'T SEE IT.

109
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,991
ANYTHING THAT MOVES,
SLAP ON A RED RIVER "D,"
AND BURN IT DEEP!

110
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,646
Cowboy: YEP.

111
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,735
WHY NOT?

112
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,652
TRY EXPLAININ' IT
TO MEEKER.

113
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:29,672
Meeker:
WELCOME HOME, MATT.

114
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:30,891
DUNSON.

115
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,415
I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE MAKING A DRIVE NORTH.

116
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,808
I AM.

117
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,679
I HEARD A FEW OF MY STRAYS

118
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,420
WANDERED OVER IN THIS DIRECTION.

119
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,683
MIND IF WE TAKE A LOOK?I DO MIND.

120
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:44,034
YOU'D STOP US?YEAH, WE WOULD.

121
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,907
LET'S TAKE THAT LOOK AROUND.

122
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,778
JUST HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

123
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:55,698
MAYBE I, UH,
SHOULD INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY NEW MAN.

124
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:56,786
WHO ARE YA?

125
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,833
SOME CALL ME ONE THING,
SOME ANOTHER.

126
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,226
SOME CALL ME CHERRY VALANCE.

127
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,707
I HEAR YOU'RE GOOD
WITH A GUN.

128
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,796
I STAY ALIVE.

129
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,714
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MR. MEEKER?

130
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,543
WHAT THE HELL, TOM,
ALL I GOT'S MY COWS.

131
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:18,199
ME TOO. SURE, I'VE ROUNDED UP
A BUNCH OF YOURS, BILL,

132
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,722
AND PROBABLY
SOME OF THE OTHERS', TOO.

133
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,768
I GOT NO TIME
TO SEPARATE 'EM OUT.

134
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,987
I'M GONNA DRIVE
THE WHOLE HERD TO MISSOURI,

135
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,861
AND WHEN I COME BACK,
I'LL GIVE YOU AND THE OTHERS
$2 A HEAD FOR 'EM.

136
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,646
SAY, USE ANOTHER HAND
ON THAT DRIVE?

137
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,040
WE CAN ALWAYS FIND ROOM
FOR ANOTHER GOOD MAN.

138
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:38,654
MATTHEW'S MY RAMROD.
HE WANTS A MAN,
HE GETS HIM.

139
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,743
WAGE IS $10 A MONTH,

140
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,093
IT'LL BE TRIPLE THAT IF
WE GET $15 AT THE TRAILHEAD.

141
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:46,749
WE LOSE THE HERD,
YOU LOSE YOUR WAGES.

142
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,751
FAIR ENOUGH.

143
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,972
GOOD LUCK, CHERRY.
GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YA.

144
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,366
THANKS, MR. MEEKER.

145
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,502
TAKE CARE OF YOUR NEW MAN.

146
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,304
I FIGURED YOU'D NEVER HIRE
ANOTHER BUCK ON THE PROD.

147
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:24,091
UNLESS YOU'RE LIKE ME...
LOOKIN' FOR DANGER.

148
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:27,355
I'M NOT LOOKIN' FOR
ANYTHING BUT A GOOD COWBOY.

149
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:30,532
WELL, THEN,
I APPRECIATE IT...
RAMROD.

150
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,229
YEAH, WELL, YOU MAY
BE CURSIN' ME INSTEAD

151
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:34,710
BEFORE WE EVER GET
THIS HERD OUT OF TEXAS.

152
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,581
PROBABLY WILL.

153
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,715
THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKIN' PIECE
YOU WERE ABOUT TO USE
BACK THERE.

154
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,761
CAN I SEE IT?

155
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,198
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO SEE MINE.

156
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:55,731
AIN'T NOTHING
MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN A GOOD GUN.

157
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,081
EXCEPT A SWISS WATCH
AND...

158
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,562
A WOMAN FROM ANYWHERE.

YOU EVER HAD
A GOOD SWISS WATCH?

160
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:06,786
GO ON. TRY IT.

161
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,788

00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:34,901
MAYBE AS GOOD AS ME.

165
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,773
PUTS TWO OF US
ON TOP OF THE HILL.

166
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,863
I'D LEAVE ROOM
FOR A THIRD.

167
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,647

172
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,897
WHOEVER KNOCKS

COME IN.GIMME THE CARDS.
GIMME THE CARDS!

174
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,728

EVEN A SMART ONE...

175
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,861
YEAH, WELL,

178
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:36,701
BUT COULD SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHERE I MIGHT FIND
THE TRAIL BOSS?

179
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,442
AHEM.

180
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,967
WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

181
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,971
WELL, I HEAR TELL
YOU'RE RUNNING A TRAIL
UP TO MISSOURI.

182
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:47,669
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I COULD--YOU THOUGHT WRONG.

183
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:50,541
WE'RE FULL UP.

184
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,068
UH-HUH.

185
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,680
THANK YOU.

186
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,859
Matt: JACK BYRD.

187
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,558
HA! LUKE HANNA'S PLACE,

188
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:10,344
YES.I USED TO RIDE OVER THERE
BEFORE THE WAR

189
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,520
JUST TO SEE YOU
GO UP ON A MEAN ONE.

190
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,522
NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT.

191
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:16,698
YOU WERE LOOKIN'
FOR A GOOD HORSE FIGHTER.

192
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,308
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

193
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,747
I SURE AIN'T RIDIN'
WITH NO NIGGER.

194
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:28,362
DON'T EVEN THINK IT,
MR. DUNSON.

195
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:31,321
Cowboy:
THAT'S RIGHT.

196
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:36,065

197
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,502
AND I NEED HIM.
SO THE MAN'S HIRED.

198
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,635
ANYBODY DOESN'T LIKE IT,
FIND THE DOOR.

199
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:49,774
LET'S TALK ABOUT
A FEW OTHER THINGS
WHILE WE'RE AT IT.

200
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:51,863
MOST OF YOU ARE ITCHING
TO GET UP THAT TRAIL

201
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:55,606
'CAUSE YOU GOT NO JOB,
NO PAY, NO CHOICE.

202
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,304
WE GOT A THOUSAND MILES TO GO,

203
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,828
AND I EXPECT AT LEAST
TWELVE MILES A DAY.

204
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:03,223
YOU CAN EXPECT RAIN,
DUST, HEAT, INDIANS,

205
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:06,139
A BACKSIDE THAT'LL BE
CRYING OUT FOR A HAMMOCK,

206
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:10,186
HALF-WILD CATTLE THAT'D RATHER
GORE A FLANK THAN EAT.

207
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,797
WE GET TO MISSOURI,
THERE'S GONNA BE BORDER GANGS.

208
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:16,105
SOME OF YOU MAY GET HURT,
MAYBE KILLED.

209
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,194
BUT NOTHIN'S GONNA STOP US.

210
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:21,676
WE'RE GONNA GET THERE
ON STRICT TRAIL DISCIPLINE.

211
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:24,766
MY WORD'S GONNA BE
THE ONLY LAW THERE IS.

212
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:28,378
WHEN YOU SIGN ON,
YOU AGREE TO GO ALL THE WAY.

213
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,947
THERE'LL BE NO QUITTING--
NOT BY YOU, AND NOT BY ME.

214
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,776
THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SIGN ON,

215
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,822
MR. DUNSON,

216
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,086
MY WIFE HASN'T
BEEN FEELING TO GOOD--

217
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,870
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HANK.
NO NEED TO EXPLAIN.

218
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,394
THANKS. AND GOOD LUCK.

219
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:47,571

ALL RIGHT, TAYLOR.
GRANT. GO AHEAD.SORRY.

221
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,753
ANYBODY ELSE?

222
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,759
Dunson: GOOD.

223
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,762
MATTHEW HERE'LL SIGN YA ON.

224
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,677

225
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,718
READY, MATTHEW?

226
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,287
READY.

227
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,599
TAKE 'EM TO MISSOURI.

228
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,386
YEEAAA....

229
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,648
HAWWWW!

230
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,607
YEEEHAW!

231
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,782
YEEEHAW!

232
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,436
...AAAAAAWWW!

233
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,924
ABOUT TIME!
YAAAAHOOO!

234
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,598
SIXTEEN YEARS
OF HARD WORK.

235
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,383
THEY SAID WE COULDN'T
MAKE THIS DRIVE.

236
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:45,994
THEY COULD BE WRONG.

237
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:48,344
THEY BETTER BE.

238
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,678
NOW, ONCE WE CLEAR
INDIAN WELLS,

239
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,550
WE'LL STRIKE OUT NORTHEAST.

240
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,335
BUT WHY MISSOURI?

241
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,728
WE COULD AVOID
THE BORDER GANGS

242
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,817
BY TURNING NORTH
AT THE RED

243
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,471
AND HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR KANSAS.

244
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,778
THERE'S A RAILHEAD
AT ABILENE NOW.

245
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,869
IF YOU'RE RIGHT
AND WE CHANGE DIRECTION
AT THE RED--

246
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:37,132
Dunson:
WE'RE GOIN' TO MISSOURI.
BOYS.

247
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,830
I'VE SEEN BUYERS AND CASH
IN SEDALIA.

248
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,485
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN
IN ABILENE?

249
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,098
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I WASN'T THERE MYSELF.

250
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:50,232
THIS LITTLE GAL MENTIONED
A RAILROAD THERE.

251
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:53,714
'COURSE, SHE MIGHTA HAD
OTHER THINGS ON HER MIND
AT THE TIME.

252
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,803
UH-HUH.

253
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:58,066
WELL, WE'RE STILL
GOIN' TO MISSOURI.

254
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:03,811
Groot:
COME AND GET IT!

255
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:08,990
THE MAN SAYS COME AND GET IT.
LET'S GO GET IT, BOYS.

256
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:14,474
I SUPPOSE IF I WAS
TO TANGLE WITH HIM...

257
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,911
I'D HAVE TO TAKE YOU ON,
TOO?

258
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:21,263
YOU'D FIND HIM A HANDFUL
BY HIMSELF.

259
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,013
HERE YA GO, JACK.

260
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,149
Matt: ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE WE EATING?

261
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,892
TIME YOU SHOWED UP.
I WAS ABOUT TO FEED YOURS
TO THE COYOTES.

262
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,807
WELL, YES, SIR,
MR. GROOT.

263
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:47,071
ONLY A FOOL SASSES A SKUNK,
A MULE, OR A COOK.

264
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,510
GET YOUR HAND
OUT OF MY SUGAR!

265
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,163
NEVER FORGET, CAL,

266
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:55,428
THIS HERE CHUCK WAGON
IS MR. GROOT'S DOMAIN.

267
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:59,432
WHY, 50 FEET AROUND IT
IS HOLY GROUND,
AND HE IS THE ALMIGHTY.

268
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:02,173
WHY YOU WANNA
FILL THE BOY'S HEAD
WITH SUCH FOLDEROL?

269
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,392
STOKE THE FIRE
UNDER THE COFFEE

270
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,002
AND SEE THAT EVERYBODY'S
GOT ENOUGH.

271
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,527
YES, SIR.AND DON'T "SIR" ME TO DEATH.

272
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,485
NO, SIR.

273
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,328
HOW'S THAT REMUDA LOOK?

274
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:27,329
HMM.

275
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,898
IT'LL DO JUST FINE,
SIR.

276
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,815
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE.

277
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:39,036
WELL, YOU CAN'T NEVER
HAVE TOO MANY
BRUSH-POPPERS.

278
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,821
NOW, THOSE APPALOOSAS,

279
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:43,389
THEY LOOK PLUMB WORE OUT
FROM THIS TRAIL DRIVE.

280
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:47,175
SEE, I FIGURES ON
GOING DOWN AND SNAGGIN' ME
A BUNCH OF WILD MUSTANGS.

281
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:49,133
I'LL WORK ON 'EM WHEN I CAN.

282
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:51,179
MAKES SENSE.

283
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,052
JACK, UM...

284
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,533
KEEP AN EYE ON OUR NIGHTHAWK.

285
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:58,969
HE'S A MITE YOUNG.

286
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:02,582
HIS PA WAS WITH ME IN THE WAR.
DIDN'T MAKE IT BACK.

287
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,889
IF THERE'S A WAY
YOU CAN TEACH HIM
ABOUT HORSES

288
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,152
WITHOUT ANYBODY
NOTICING TOO MUCH...

289
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:11,025
YEAH...

290
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,983
THEY'RE PROBABLY
RAG THAT POOR BOY
TO DEATH

291
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:17,074
IF THEY FIGURED OUT
HE WAS LEARNIN' SOMETHING
FROM THE LIKES OF ME.

292
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:19,990
I APPRECIATE YOU
UNDERSTANDING THAT.

293
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:25,735
WELL, MR. GARTH,
I THINK I'M THE ONE

294
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:29,696
SHOULD BE DOING
THE APPRECIATING.

295
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:32,307
I BEEN SHUT OUT
EVERY PLACE I WENT

296
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,484
BEFORE I CAME
TO YOUR SPREAD...

297
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:39,401
AND I SURE DO WANT TO
DO RIGHT BY YOU.

298
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,838

299
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:46,190
EVENIN', SIR.EVENIN', JACK.

300
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:55,112
MATTHEW, BEST NOT
TO RILE YOUR CREW

301
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:58,115
BY BEING PARTIAL
TO SOME BLACK COWBOY
HASN'T PROVED HIMSELF YET.

302
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,815
I JUST WANTED HIM TO KNOW
HOW IT'S GONNA BE.

303
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:06,863
WELL, I TELL YOU
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE--
WE GOTTA PUSH 'EM HARDER.

304
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,604
WELL, TODAY WAS ABOUT IT.

305
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,954
YOU CAN DO BETTER.

306
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:15,524
WE GET TO INDIAN TERRITORY,
ALL HELL COULD BREAK LOOSE.

307
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:16,960
COFFEE?

308
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:19,833
YEAH, BUT YOU BEST TEND
TO YOUR TRAIL BOSS FIRST.

309
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,704
AGE BEFORE BEAUTY.

310
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:22,879
OH! DAMN, BOY!

311
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:29,190
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
DON'T LOOK SO SCARED.

00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,431
YOU AIN'T VERY SOCIAL

379
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,912
YEAH, I'M JUST TIRED.

380
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,827
OF HIM.

381
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,787
WELL, HE ALWAYS WAS
A HARD MAN.

382
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,703
NOW HE'S TOO HARD
ON EVERYBODY.

383
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,184
ESPECIALLY YOU.

384

00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:20,367
START?

387
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,675
HE'S BEEN WORRYING
ABOUT ONE THING OR ANOTHER
FOR 15 YEARS.

388
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:27,940
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

389
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:32,683
AIN'T A DAY GOES BY
HE DOESN'T THINK ABOUT ANNIE.

390
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:34,860
HOW MAYBE SHE'D BE ALIVE

391
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:38,689
IF HE HADN'T LEFT HER
WITH THAT WAGON TRAIN.

392
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:42,911
AND THEN YOU
GOING OFF TO WAR.

393

404
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:54,113
IF THE GUN WENT OFF,

405
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:56,550

440
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,679
THE LORD GIVETH

446
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:50,496
MR. DUNSON, UH--

A MILLSTONE OF A KID,

449
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:57,459
DEVIL KNOWS HOW MANY
WIND-BROKE HORSES

452
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:06,207
I DON'T WANT YOUR ARM.

453
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,208
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A WHIPPIN'.

454
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,341
DON'T DO IT, MR. DUNSON.

455
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:12,257
I WAS DEAD WRONG,
BUT NOBODY'S GONNA WHIP ME.

456
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,607
YOU BETTER TURN AROUND,
OR YOU'RE GONNA GET IT
IN THE FACE.

457
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,652
NO. NO.

458
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:18,785

468
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:53,776
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.

00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:15,537
MOVE IT!

470
00:37:16,582 --> 00:37:17,539

Man: COME ON, GROOT.Groot: AW, WAIT YOUR TURN.

474
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:26,722
FOOD AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE.

475
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,637
COME ON ON UP HERE, JACK.

476
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,118
GET YOUR GRUB.
YOU GOT THE FIRST WATCH.

477
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,989
HEY, YOU AIN'T
SERVIN' HIM
BEFORE ME.

478
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:35,296
NO GOOD HORSES
IS SO LAZY

479
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,732
YOU GOTTA
SADDLE HIM TONIGHT

480
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,821

WORK HIM TOMORROW.

481
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:39,953
HA HA HA!

482
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,913
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
I WAS JUST JOSHIN' HIM.

483
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:52,313
WHAT'D YOU DO?
SCRAPE THE MUD
OFF OUR BOOTS

484
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,923
TO BREW THIS SWILL?

485
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,969
ME AND NATURE
DONE BEST WE COULD.

486
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:58,580
CAN'T MAKE BURNT GRAIN
TASTE LIKE COFFEE.

487
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:02,715
Teeler: I'D LIKE TO
GIMME SOME COFFEE.

488
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,718
TELL DUNSON WHAT?

489
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:10,766
THAT STAMPEDE. THE INJURIES.

490
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,247
LOW ON FOOD. A MAN KILLED.

491
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,336
AND NOW THIS CRAZY WEATHER.

492
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,861
WE'LL GET TO HELL
SOONER THAN MISSOURI.

493
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:21,821
YEAH, BUT WE DIDN'T.
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA.

494
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:24,214
EVEN IF THERE WAS
A TRADING POST AROUND HERE,

495
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,652
I COULDN'T REPLACE
WHAT I'VE LOST. I'M BROKE.

496
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:29,785
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE ON
SHORT RATIONS AND BAD COFFEE

497
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:31,570
TILL YA GET THE DRIVE FINISHED.

498
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:33,006
AND YOU'RE GONNA
FINISH IT.

499
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:34,703
LIKE IT OR NOT.

500
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,794
THAT'S IT.

501
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:47,673
WELL, NOW,
THAT STALLION'S JUST MY MEAT.

502
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:50,284
THAT BAY'S ONLY HALF-BROKE.
YOU CAN'T RIDE HIM.

503
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,939
YOU WAIT FOR JACK,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOOD FOR YA.

504
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:55,420
AIN'T A HORSE BORN
THAT I CAN'T RIDE!NO, JACK SAID--

505
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,291
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR BOY SAID!

506
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,032
THIS IS MY HORSE!WAIT!

507
00:39:00,686 --> 00:39:01,904
WHOA!

00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:03,297
DAMNIT!

509
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,473
YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK YOUR NECK!

510
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:08,171
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

511
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:21,184
NO YOU DON'T!

512
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:22,882
GET OFF ME!

513
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,583
Cherry: HEY!

00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,764
BREAK IT UP!

515
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:37,679

AND I'LL KILL YOU!SIMMER DOWN, BOY!

517
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:44,469
YOU ASKED FOR IT,
RUNT! LET'S SEE
WHO KILLS WHO! DRAW!

518
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,471
NOBODY'S GONNA DRAW
ON NOBODY!

519
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,474
HANDS CLEAR OF
THOSE GUNS! NOW!

520
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:51,606
Matt:
NOW, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

521
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,347
A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT
OVER THE BAY.

522
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,523
EVERYTHING'S FINE NOW.

523
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,786
YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME,
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE?

524
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,659
SLAP LEATHER AND GO BANG,
FALL DOWN AND GET UP AGAIN?

525
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:02,356
IT AIN'T THAT WAY
IN REAL LIFE!

526
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,705
IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED!

527
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:06,491
AND YOU'RE A DAMN
LONG TIME DEAD!

528
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:09,058
NOW, DON'T LET THIS
HAPPEN AGAIN, YOU HEAR?!

529
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:14,716
YES, SIR.

530
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,526
WHO ARE YA?

531
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:44,137
COTTON GROGAN.

532
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,705
RAMROD OF THE CIRCLE K.

533
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:49,708
WHO ROPE-DRAGGED YA?

534
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:52,101
MISSOURI BORDER GANG.

535
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:55,627
STAMPEDED OUR HERD
AND DROVE 'EM INTO THE RIVER.

536
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,716
KNOCKED MY BOYS OFF
ONE BY ONE

537
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,500
AS WE TRIED
TO GET OUR COWS BACK.

538
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,720
THOSE OF US THAT SURVIVED

539
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:03,896
THEY ROPE-TIED US
TO OUR HORSES.

540
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:06,115
I GUESS I'M LUCKY.

541
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,640
MINE GOT SNARLED UP
AND BROKE...

542
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:10,903
AND I HID IN THE BUSH.

543
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:15,385
I SHOULDA LISTENED TO THAT
HALF-BREED JESS CHISHOLM.

544
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:20,565
HE SAID HE BLAZED A TRAIL
STRAIGHT ON UP THROUGH
THE NATIONS INTO KANSAS.

545
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:23,263
NOTHIN' TO WORRY ABOUT
EXCEPT INDIANS.

546
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:24,569
WHERE IN KANSAS?

547
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:27,310
HE SAID THE RAILHEAD
REACHED ABILENE, KANSAS.

548
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:30,226
ABILENE?
THAT'S WHAT CHERRY SAID.

549
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:34,970
DID HE SAY HE SAWIT?

550
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:39,845
I CAN'T RIGHTLY REMEMBER.

551
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:43,065
WANT TO JOIN UP WITH US?

552
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:45,459
NAH. NO, I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

553
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,548
Simms:
AND I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

554
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:50,551
TWO MONTHS ON THE TRAIL,
WE'RE ALL GOIN' ROUND THE BEND.

555
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:51,857
LISTEN TO WHAT THE MAN SAYS!

556
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,077
AIN'T NONE OF US
GONNA GET TO MISSOURI ALIVE.

557
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:57,253
I'M HEADIN' SOUTH.

558
00:41:57,297 --> 00:42:01,606
UNLESS YOU WANT TO TRY ABILENE,
MR. DUNSON, LIKE CHERRY SAID,

559
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:03,042
I'M GONE, TOO.

560
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:08,482
YOU MEN SIGNED ON
TO FINISH THIS DRIVE.

561
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,223
I'M GONNA HOLD YA TO IT.

562
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:17,839
HOW?

563
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,539
I DON'T WANNA
HAVE TO KILL YA.

564
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:22,888
WITH WHAT?

565
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,678
Groot: TOM!

566
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:39,644
YOU WANNA HEAD SOUTH, TEELER?

567
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:51,569
THERE'S A QUITTER
TO BE BURIED.

568
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:01,491
AHH.

569
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:12,372
GO AHEAD. SAY IT.

570
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:14,243
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

571
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:16,637
YOU WERE READY
FOR TEELER THERE.

572
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:18,683
IF HE'D OF TRIED TO DRAW ON ME,
YOU WOULDA KILLED HIM.

573
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:21,773
I OWED YOU THAT.
BUT YOU WERE WRONG.

574
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:23,209
HELL I WAS.

575
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,777
YOU LET ONE MAN
GET AWAY WITH THAT,

576
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,084
HALF THE CREW'D BE GONE
BY MORNING.

577
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:31,217
LET ME SEE THIS.

578
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:38,050
MATTHEW, SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT,
YOU HAVE TO KILL A MAN.

579
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:42,054
IF THE SOUTH THOUGHT
IT WAS IN THE RIGHT,
SO DID THE NORTH.

580
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:46,058
NOW HALF A MILLION MEN
WON'T SEE ANOTHER SUNRISE.

581
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,103
HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY.

582
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:53,631
YOU KNOW...I THINK
MAYBE CHERRY WAS RIGHT.

583
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:56,155
WAR HAS MADE YOU SOFT.

584
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:58,592
YA FEEL TOO MUCH.

585
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,773
I'LL TAKE YOUR ORDERS.

586
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:08,515
I'LL DO YOUR WORK.

587
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,910
BUT DON'T TELL ME
HOW I SHOULD FEEL.

588
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,592
WHAT'S WRONG?TEELER, LOREDO
AND KELSEY ARE GONE.

589
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,725
DID THEY TAKE ANYTHING?

590
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:47,423
GRUB AND CARTRIDGES.

591
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:51,036
CHERRY, TAKE TWO MEN WITH YOU.
THEY MUST HAVE HEADED SOUTH.

592
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,994
FIND 'EM,
BRING 'EM BACK.

593
00:44:53,038 --> 00:44:56,041
ONE'LL DO. CATCH UP TO YA
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RED.

594
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,827
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANY EXCUSES

595
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,611
ABOUT BEING
SHORT-HANDED, EITHER.

596
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:03,526
THIS OUTFIT'S
GONNA MOVE.

597
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:10,229
DAMN,
I HOPE THOSE GUYS MAKE IT.

598
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:33,861
KEEP A NARROW LINE!
NARROW LINE!

599
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:37,822
STRAIGHT ACROSS!
STRAIGHT ACROSS!

600
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,682
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BRING BACK THREE.

601
00:46:57,075 --> 00:46:59,555
KELSEY FIGURED
HE'D FIGHT.

602
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,470
IT WAS HIS LAST.

603
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:05,039
YOU MEN ARE WORSE
THAN DESERTERS.

604
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,649
YOU'RE COMMON THIEVES.

605
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:08,390
THE LAW MIGHT SEE IT
DIFFERENT.

606
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:09,827
I'M THE LAW HERE.

607
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,872
Teeler: I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO,

608
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:15,658
BUT FIRST I'M GONNA SAY
WHAT EVERYBODY'S
AFRAID TO ADMIT.

609
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:17,573
YOU'RE CRAZY.

610
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:20,011
LIKE A BLIND MULE,
YOU'LL PLOW AHEAD TO MISSOURI

611
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:21,795
WITH THE HIGH, LOW,
AND JACK AGAINST YA.

612
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,929
YES, I SIGNED A PLEDGE.

613
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:27,148
I SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN AWAY.

614
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:30,369
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED
AND PUT A BULLET IN YOU.

615
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:32,850
YOU FINISHED?

616
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,374
NOW YOU CAN GET YOUR BIBLE
AND READ OVER US

617
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:36,810
AFTER YOU SHOOT US.

618
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:39,813
I'M GONNA HANG YA.

619
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:46,167
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

620
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,821
WHO'S GONNA STOP ME?

621
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,867
I AM.

622
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:10,452
GIMME A GUN, DAMNIT!

623
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:12,193
I WANT A GUN!
I'LL KILL HIM!

624

639
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:15,343
I'LL FINISH THE DRIVE.

00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:16,954

641
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:20,522
YOU WAS WRONG, TOM.

642
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,700
BUT IT'S BEEN YOU AND ME
FOR A LOT OF YEARS.

643
00:49:24,744 --> 00:49:28,487
SO RIGHT OR WRONG,
THAT'S THE WAY I STILL WANT IT.

644
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:32,621
WELL, I DON'T.

AS THE REST OF 'EM.

645
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:36,712

646
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:40,325

00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:47,897

649
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:49,073
LET'S MOVE!

650
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:52,815

653
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,780
Groot:

654
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,919

00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:13,184
WE'LL GET YOUR HERD

00:50:13,227 --> 00:50:15,708

00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:24,891
I DON'T KNOW WHERE OR WHEN,

661
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:28,068
BUT ONE TIME,

I'LL BE THERE...

662
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,462

00:51:56,548 --> 00:51:59,028
LOOK, JACK,
I WAS WRONG.

678
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:02,336
GIVE UP ON HIM.
HE'S NEVER GONNA
MAKE NO KIND OF HORSE.

679
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,905
I PROMISED HIM TO YA...

680
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:10,692
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE HIM.

681

WHOO! WHOO!

683
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:32,149
GROOT,
WHAT'S THE HOLD-UP?

684
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,803
TRACE STRAP BROKE.
I ALMOST LOST THE TEAM.

685
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:36,805
WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YA.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CATCH UP.

686
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,981
YOU'RE GETTIN'
BAD AS DUNSON.

687
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:42,985
LOOK, EVEN IF HE PICKS UP
SOME DEPUTIES IN PRESTON,

688
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:46,206
HE AIN'T GONNA BE ABLE
TO CATCH UP TO US
ANYTIME SOON.
NO.

689
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:49,209
YOU AIN'T SORRY
YOU DONE IT?

690
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,864
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS WRONG.

691
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,388
I JUST HOPE I'M RIGHT.

692
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:57,086
I HOPE THERE'S A RAILROAD
IN ABILENE.

693
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,132
CHERRY AND LAREDO
AIN'T BACK YET.

694
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,134
WE GONNA GO FIGHTIN'
SOME INDIANS?

695
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,919
BOY,
YOU BETTER PRAY NOT.

696
00:53:03,963 --> 00:53:05,791
THAT'S THE LAST THING WE NEED.

697
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:08,750
YEAH. SOMETHIN'
MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO 'EM.

698
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:11,623
I'LL TAKE THE SCOUT AND JACK
AND GO LOOK FOR 'EM.

699
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,668
YOU AND BUSTER
KEEP 'EM MOVING.YES, SIR.

700
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:30,990
COMANCHES.
COUPLE OF DOZEN AT LEAST.

701
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,610
THE THREE OF US
AIN'T GONNA MAKE
MUCH DIFFERENCE.

702
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:46,658
BUT I'LL TELL YA WHAT,

703
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:49,748
A FEW MORE CHIPS
JUST MIGHT CHANGE THE GAME.

704
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,620
CUT OUT A HUNDRED OR SO
OF THE FRONT-RUNNERS
AND HURRY 'EM UP AHEAD.

705
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:04,806
AAAAAH!

706
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,255
HOW YA DOIN'?

707
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:20,344
RUNNN' A LITTLE LOW.

708
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:30,310
YOU MAY BE SHORT OF AMMUNITION,

709
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:33,748
BUT OTHERWISE...
YOU GOT EVERYTHING
A MAN COULD EVER WANT.

710
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:35,837
HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT SUCH THINGS

711
00:54:35,881 --> 00:54:37,317
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

712
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:42,279
ANYTHING BETTER
TO HAVE ON YOUR MIND

713
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:44,237
WHEN ETERNITY
TAKES YOU IN HER ARMS?

714
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,848
MR. VALANCE,
WE ARE ALL VERY GRATEFUL.

715
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:48,807
I'M SURE WE'D BE DEAD BY NOW

716
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,809
IF YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
HADN'T HAPPENED ALONG.

717
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:54,247
BUT HAVEN'T YOU GOT
ANYTHING BETTER TO DO?

718
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,031
I WOULD IF YOU'D BE WILLIN'.

719
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:10,829
THANK YOU.

720
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,488
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

721
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:19,751
ONE OF OURS COMIN' IN!
HOLD FIRE!

722
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:33,678
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

723
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:35,244
I FIGURED
YOU'D TURNED AROUND

724
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:36,637
AND GAVE THE HERD
BACK TO DUNSON.

725
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:38,073
WHO'S IN CHARGE?

726
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,162
PRUITT?!

727
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:42,861
COLONEL PRUITT,
CAPTAIN GARTH.

728
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:45,298
YOU TWO MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
IN THE SAME ARMY IN THE WAR,

729
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,691
BUT YOU ARE NOW!

730
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:48,388
WHAT'S THE SITUATION,
COLONEL?

731
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:50,695
WE GOT PLENTY
OF FOOD AND WATER,
BUT WE'RE LOW ON AMMUNITION.

732
00:55:50,738 --> 00:55:52,087
CAN YOU HOLD OUT
TWO OR THREE MORE HOURS?

733
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:54,002
NOT IF THEY COME AT US
FULL-BORE.

734
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:55,917
WELL, THEY FIGURE
YOU'RE HELPLESS TO ESCAPE,

735
00:55:55,961 --> 00:55:57,354
SO THEY MAY JUST
BLEED YOU A WHILE

736
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:58,572
TILL YOU'RE RIPE
FOR THE PLUCKING.

737
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:00,792
AND THAT'D GIVE US TIME.FOR WHAT?

738
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:02,184
BRING PART OF OUR HERD UP.

739
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:03,969
WE MAY BE DEAD BY THEN.

740
00:56:05,013 --> 00:56:06,232
SARAH!

741
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,070
SARAH, STAY HERE.

742
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,380
BACK OFF, FRIEND.
SHE'S MINE.

743
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:24,990
AIN'T NO BRAND ON HER.

744
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:27,122
BESIDES,
YOU AIN'T GOT A PRAYER.

745
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,429
SHE AIN'T EXACTLY PARTIAL
TO JOHNNY REBS.

746
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:30,474
WHAT'S THAT MAKE YOU?

747
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:33,390
A MAN WHO LOVES A CHALLENGE.

748
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:37,306
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
SO DO I.

749
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:55,716

THEY'RE GOIN' AFTER THE CATTLE!

757
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:15,753
Groot:
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE,
HONEY.

758
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:17,711
THANK YOU.

759
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,679
NEVER SEEN STARS
SO BRIGHT.

760
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:30,942
MR. VALANCE.
I-I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

761
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:33,727
OR COURSE,
THEY AIN'T AS BRIGHT
AS THE TWO OF YOU.

762
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:35,686
HER MOTHER'S WAITING.

763
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:38,036
LAST THING WE SEE BEFORE WE
DRIFT OFF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT
IS THEM STARS.

764
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,038
THAT'S WHY COWBOYS
KNOW A LOT ABOUT 'EM.

765
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:42,170
WE REALLY
HAVE TO GET BACK.

766
00:58:42,214 --> 00:58:44,564
HERE, TAKE A LOOK.

767
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,349
SEE THAT?
THAT'S THE BIG DIPPER.

768
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:50,657
COWBOYS TELL THE TIME BY IT.

769
00:58:50,701 --> 00:58:54,531
SARAH, TELL YOUR MOMMY
YOUR LEG'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

770
00:58:57,621 --> 00:59:00,319
MR. VALANCE,
WHAT'S A REMUDA?

771
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:03,191
THAT'S A BUNCH OF HORSES

772
00:59:03,235 --> 00:59:06,586
LOOK, I AIN'T THROUGH

773
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,675
CAN I WALK WITH YOU?

774
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,070
NO. THANK YOU,
MR. VALANCE.
I'LL BE FINE.

775
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:15,029
GOOD NIGHT,
MR. VALANCE.

776
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:20,557
LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS CALL ME "CHERRY."

777
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,823
GOOD NIGHT, CHERRY.

778
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:35,136
IT'S A GREAT HORSE.

779
00:59:36,485 --> 00:59:38,749
CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
IT MEANS TO ME, SIR.

780
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,054
I SURE AM GRATEFUL.

781
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:41,752
WELL,
JACK DID ALL THE WORK.

782
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:50,587
MY PA WAS DIRT POOR.

783
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,719
NOW, I DON'T KNOW, BUT MAYBE
THAT'S WHY HE THOUGHT SLAVES

784
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:55,635
WERE JUST A BUNCH
OF LAZY NIGGERS.

785
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:57,942
AND I USED TO THINK THAT TOO,
BUT NOW...

786
00:59:57,985 --> 01:00:01,206
NOW I HATE IT
WHEN BOOTS AND ALL THE OTHERS

787
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:03,948
TALK ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT.

788
01:00:03,991 --> 01:00:05,645
BECAUSE JACK--

789
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:06,733
LOOK.

790
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:11,129
YOU GOTTA TREAT A MAN
THE WAY YOU FIND HIM,

791
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:14,654
NO MATTER HOW HE LOOKS
OR HE DRESSES...

792
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:15,742
WHATEVER.

793
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:19,746
IF HE'S A GOOD MAN,
YOU'LL KNOW IT.

794
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,748
AND IF HE'S NOT...

795
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:24,751
WELL, YOU'LL KNOW THAT,
TOO.

796
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:30,452
JACK...

797
01:00:30,496 --> 01:00:31,802
JACK'S A GOOD MAN.

798
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:35,501
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTRUDE.

799
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:37,938
I WAS JUST
WALKING BACK TO CAMP

800
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:41,115
AND I WANTED TO SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT.

801
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:43,683
UH, CALVIN BURNETT,
THIS IS MRS. MILLAY.

802
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,119
EVENIN', MA'AM.

803
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:48,470
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
UH, I'M NIGHTHAWK.

804
01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:49,950
YEAH.

805
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,434
I'M SORRY FOR
THE WAY I WAS TODAY.

806
01:00:55,477 --> 01:00:58,829
YOU WERE ONLY TRYING
TO GET US OUT OF THERE ALIVE.

807
01:00:58,872 --> 01:01:01,483
ANYHOW, I WANTED YOU
TO KNOW I'M GRATEFUL.

808
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:04,573
WELL, I RECKON
I WASN'T BEHAVING
MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN.

809
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:06,663
I'M GLAD
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

810
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:12,451
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO WALK YOU TO YOUR WAGON?

811
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:14,583
IF IT WOULDN'T BE
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

812
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:16,542
I'D BE HONORED.

813
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:24,463
THE STARS
SURE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

814
01:01:24,506 --> 01:01:27,727
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

815
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,644
YOUR MR. VALANCE
JUST SAID THAT TO ME.

816
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,993
HE DID?

817
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:35,735
SOMETHING LIKE IT.

818
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:39,652
AND YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL.

819
01:01:41,132 --> 01:01:42,568
I COULDN'T HELP
BUT OVERHEAR

820
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:44,744
WHAT YOU SAID
TO THAT YOUNG COWBOY.

821
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:48,574
AND YET YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE
IN A WAR TO PRESERVE SLAVERY.

822
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,273
I NEVER WANTED THAT WAR.

823
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:54,536
AND I DIDN'T JOIN UP
TO KEEP SLAVERY.

824
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,715
IT'S JUST THERE ARE
CERTAIN THINGS WORTH
FIGHTING FOR--

825
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,847
YOUR LAND, YOUR FAMILY...

826
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:04,024
I ONCE THOUGHT THAT
THAT INCLUDED PRIDE

827
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:07,201
AND...HONOR.

828
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:09,160
I'M NOT SO SURE ANYMORE.

829
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:15,340
YOUR HUSBAND WAS KILLED?

830
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:27,656
LAST THING I DID
BEFORE I HEADED WEST

831
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:32,357
WAS TO FIND
THE UNION CEMETERY
HE WAS BURIED IN.

832
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,492
THEY HAD THE RECORDS
ALL MIXED UP.

833
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,671
I NEVER DID FIGURE OUT
WHICH GRAVE WAS HIS.

834
01:02:44,717 --> 01:02:46,763
I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER.

835
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:49,069
HE'S STILL DEAD.

836
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,606
WOULD YOU LIKE ME HOLD YOU
FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE?

837
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:24,670
I'M SORRY.

838
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:28,021
THANK YOU FOR
WALKING WITH ME.

839
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,244
GOOD NIGHT.

840
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:52,437
IF DUNSON PICKS UP
SOME MEN IN PRESTON

841
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,657
HE COULD BE
CLOSE AS...

842
01:03:55,701 --> 01:03:58,095
FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AWAY.

843
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:03,056
SO WHAT YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT THAT WAGON TRAIN?

844
01:04:05,406 --> 01:04:07,713
THEY CAN'T SLOW US
THAT MUCH.

845
01:04:07,756 --> 01:04:11,238
ANOTHER TWO OR THREE DAYS
THEY'LL BE CLEAR OF
THE COMANCHES.

846
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:16,330
THAT FIRST DAY...

847
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:19,246
I'D HAVE KILLED YOU
WITHOUT BLINKING AN EYE.

848
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:24,512
AIN'T GONNA BE SO EASY NOW...

849
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:27,646
NOW THAT WE GOT
SOMETHING BETWEEN US.

850
01:04:27,689 --> 01:04:29,430
WHAT'S THAT?

851
01:04:32,346 --> 01:04:35,610
SHE'S A QUALITY WOMAN.

852
01:04:35,654 --> 01:04:39,179
LYIN' HERE, I MOSTLY
BEEN THINKING OF HER.

853
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,487
YEAH.

854
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:44,663
SHE DOES SEEM
A WHOLE LOT PRETTIER

855
01:04:44,706 --> 01:04:46,839
THAN THE FIRST TIME
I SAW HER.

856
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:50,060
I HAD MY SHARE
OF PRETTY WOMEN, NOW,

857
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:53,324
YOU KNOW, GIVE 'EM
A SHINY TRINKET OR...

858
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:57,458
DEPENDIN' ON THE KIND SHE IS,
SOME HARD CASH.

859
01:04:57,502 --> 01:05:00,548
YOU COULD HAVE HER ALL NIGHT.

860
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,813
BUT A QUALITY WOMAN, NOW,

861
01:05:04,857 --> 01:05:07,033
THAT'S A DIFFERENT PROPOSITION.

862
01:05:07,077 --> 01:05:09,079
HER...

863
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,646
YOU GOT TO GIVE SOMETHING
INSIDE YOURSELF,

864
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:15,476
SOMETHING YOU AIN'T WILLING
TO GIVE TO NOBODY ELSE.

865
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:23,658
BUT I AIN'T NEVER HAD ME
A...QUALITY WOMAN.

866
01:05:52,905 --> 01:05:56,778
RIFLE CASINGS AND INDIAN SIGNS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER,

867
01:05:56,822 --> 01:05:59,738
WHEEL TRACKS,
AND NOW THIS CAMP.

868
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:03,785
LOOKS TO ME LIKE
SOME WAGON TRAIN
RAN INTO COMANCHES.

869
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:05,831
AND NOW THEY'RE TRAILING
ALONG WITH THE HERD.

870
01:06:05,874 --> 01:06:09,095
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ONLY
TWO OR THREE DAYS BEHIND,
BOYS. LET'S GO.

871
01:06:13,926 --> 01:06:14,883
I GOT THAT WHEEL THERE!

872
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:32,292
I'M TELLING YOU, MATT,
THEY'RE SLOWING US DOWN.

873
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:34,686
WHY DON'T YOU LET US LEAD?

874
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:38,429
AND HAVE ALL THESE
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
EATING OUR DUST ALL DAY?

875
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:42,520
TWO OR THREE DAYS WE'LL BE
OUT OF INJUN TERRITORY.

876
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:43,956
THEN WE'LL SEE.

877
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:48,700
IF YOU SAY.
YOU KNOW DUNSON
BETTER THAN I DO.

878
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,317
A FEW MORE HOURS
AND WE'LL STOP FOR THE NIGHT.

879
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:59,580
OFFICER GARTH,
I HAVEN'T CRIED

880
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:02,148
SINCE THE DAY THE SOLDIERS
CAME TO TELL ME.

881
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:04,063
I DON'T KNOW
WHY IT HAPPENED.

882
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:07,849
YOU WERE A STRANGER.
I HAD NO RIGHT TO
BURDEN YOU.

883
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:09,851
I'M GLAD YOU DID.

884
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,514
MA'AM.

885
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:30,394
"THE PRINCE LIFTED HER
IN HIS ARMS

886
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:32,265
"AND PLACED HER
ON HIS WHITE HORSE,

887
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:34,093
"AND OFF THEY RODE TOGETHER,

888
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:37,227
TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER."

889
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:39,055
NOW, OFF YOU GO.

890
01:07:59,423 --> 01:08:02,643
THIS IS MY FAVORITE
DESERT FLOWER.

891
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:05,820
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT KIND IT IS, BUT...

892
01:08:05,864 --> 01:08:09,172
IT PUTS ME IN MIND OF YOU.OH, CHERRY--

893
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:12,958
DON'T. DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
JUST TAKE 'EM.

894
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:16,962
THANK YOU.

895
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:18,746
I PUT IT IN THERE

896
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:19,921
DIRT ROOTS AND ALL

897
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:22,924
SO IT'LL GO ON LIVIN' FOR YA.

898
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,666
I--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

899
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:29,148
I-- I-I DON'T BEAT
AROUND THE BUSH, MA'AM.

900
01:08:31,803 --> 01:08:34,632
YOU'RE THE KIND OF WOMAN
THAT--THAT...

901
01:08:34,675 --> 01:08:37,722
I COULD SPEND
THE REST OF MY DAYS WITH...

902
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:42,422
STOP ROVIN', PUT DOWN MY ROOTS,
JUST LIKE THAT DESERT FLOWER.

903
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:45,164
CHERRY, I--YOU'RE GONNA NEED A MAN.

904
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:48,602
YOU COULD DO A WHOLE LOT WORSE
THAN CHERRY VALANCE.

905
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:52,345
CHERRY, I'M FLATTERED,

906
01:08:52,389 --> 01:08:55,653
HONORED THAT YOU'D FEEL
THE WAY YOU DO ABOUT ME.

907
01:08:55,696 --> 01:08:58,482
BUT IT'S TOO SOON
FOR ME TO EVEN THINK

908
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:00,745
OF PLEDGING MYSELF
TO ANOTHER MAN.

909
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:12,191
NOT EVEN...MATTHEW GARTH?

910
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:17,327
CERTAINLY NOT TO A MAN
WHO SERVED IN AN ARMY
THAT KILLED MY HUSBAND.

911
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,937
NOW, PLEASE,
I APPRECIATE THE FLOWER--

912
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,070
YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME...

913
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:23,985
JUST LIKE I WANT YOU.

914
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:27,032
AND YOU MIGHT
ADMIT AS MUCH.

915
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:30,862
IF I WAS SOME BIG CATTLEMAN
WITH A FAT 20-BUCKS-A-COW HERD
IN MYHIP POCKET--

916
01:09:30,905 --> 01:09:32,168
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

917
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:34,605
NOW THAT I HAVE FOUND YOU...

918
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:39,175
I AIN'T ABOUT TO LOSE YOU.

919
01:09:42,134 --> 01:09:43,614
NO MATTER WHAT.

920
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:12,469
MAYBE THAT STORM
AIN'T COMIN' IN TONIGHT.

921
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:13,687
THEY KNOW IT.

922
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:16,690
THEY AIN'T
PAYIN' IT NO MIND.

923
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:17,909
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

924
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:24,481
I'M TIRED OF BEIN'
SOMEBODY'S HIRED GUN.

925
01:10:25,786 --> 01:10:29,094
THIS MAY BE
THE ONLY CHANCE
I'LL EVER HAVE.

926
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:30,748
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

927
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,362
I'M GOING TO MAKE
MATTHEW GARTH DRAW ON ME...

928
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:40,192
KILL HIM,

929
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,802
AND TAKE THE HERD.

930
01:10:58,863 --> 01:11:02,040
ARKANSAS RIVER!

931
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,998
IT'S SIX MILES
UP AHEAD!

932
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:05,739
WE'VE ALREADY CROSSED
THE BORDER!

933
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:08,264
WE GOT THE FIRST
CATTLE INTO KANSAS
SINCE THE END OF THE WAR!

934
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:10,962
YEAH!
WELL, RIDE ON BACK
AND SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS.

935
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:13,356
ALL RIGHT!
YEE-HAW!

936
01:11:16,228 --> 01:11:17,708
LONG STRETCH
TO NIGHT CAMP.

937
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:18,926
SEE IF YOU CAN'T
TIGHTEN THE MARCH.

938
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:20,798
DO IT YOURSELF.

939
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:22,974
I AIN'T YOUR RAMROD
NO MORE.

940
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:24,149
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

941
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:27,631
DEMOTED MYSELF
TO COWBOY, THAT'S WHAT.

942
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:29,502
THAT'S THE WAY I WANT IT.

943
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:40,644
HO! HO, HO, HO.

944
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,690
ONE MORE DAY.

945
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:10,804
WHY'D YOU LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT?

946
01:12:10,848 --> 01:12:12,110
LIKE WHAT?

947
01:12:12,153 --> 01:12:14,155
YOU GAVE ME A BAD LOOK.

948
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,462
I DID NOT.I SAY YOU DID.

949
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:18,769
ANYBODY CALLS ME A LIAR

950
01:12:18,812 --> 01:12:21,380
BETTER GET READY
TO GO FOR HIS GUN.

951
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:22,599
NOW, YOU BACK OFF.

952
01:12:25,123 --> 01:12:27,125
HE DIDN'T LOOK AT YOU

953
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:28,692
OR CALL YOU NOTHIN'.

954
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:33,784
YOU SAYIN'
MY FRIEND'S A LIAR?

955
01:12:41,835 --> 01:12:43,010
I THINK YOU

956
01:12:43,054 --> 01:12:44,969
AND YOUR
LITTLE YELLOW PUP

957
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:46,405
BETTER GET DOWN
ON YOUR KNEES

958
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:48,668
AND TELL MY FRIEND
YOU'RE SORRY.

959
01:12:52,672 --> 01:12:54,326
YOU TOUCH THAT RIFLE,
OLD MAN,

960
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,850
YOU'VE MADE YOUR LAST
SOURDOUGH BISCUIT.

961
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:04,728
AIN'T GOT NOTHIN'
TO DO WITH YOU BOYS.

962
01:13:06,686 --> 01:13:08,340
JUST HIM AND ME.

963
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,995
MATT! IT'S CHERRY!

964
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:14,607
ALL RIGHT, YOU HEAD
ON BACK TO YOUR WAGON.

965
01:13:14,651 --> 01:13:16,000
GO ON!

966
01:13:16,043 --> 01:13:17,436
YOU HEARD ME.

967
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:20,004
ON YOUR KNEES.

968
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:23,529
I AIN'T GONNA DO THAT.

969
01:13:27,098 --> 01:13:28,708
YOU THINK
YOU'RE A MAN?

970
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:29,796
HUH?

971
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,668
I AIN'T GONNA DO IT.

972
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:32,886
GIVE HIM YOUR GUN.

973
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,722
YOU STRAP THAT ON

974
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:44,420
AND YOU BE A MAN.

975
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:51,122
CHERRY.

976
01:13:55,387 --> 01:13:58,651
STAY OUT OF THIS,
MATTHEW.

977
01:13:58,695 --> 01:14:00,044
I DON'T WANT
TO KILL YOU.

978
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:01,785
HE WAS A SLAVE.

979
01:14:01,828 --> 01:14:04,440
HE WASN'T ALLOWED
TO EVEN HANDLE A GUN.

980
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:07,617
NEXT TIME I LOOK...

981
01:14:09,706 --> 01:14:11,882
THAT NIGGER
BETTER BE GONE,

982
01:14:11,925 --> 01:14:13,710
OR HE'S DEAD.

983
01:14:13,753 --> 01:14:15,625
MR. GARTH...

984
01:14:15,668 --> 01:14:19,498
I THINK IT'D BE BEST
IF I JUST LEAVE.

985
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,805
AIN'T NO USE
IN NOBODY DYIN'
OVER THIS.

986
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:29,073
NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE
BUT THE MAN WHO THINKS
HE CAN PUSH PEOPLE WITH A GUN.

987
01:14:33,904 --> 01:14:35,775
YOU CALLIN' ME
A DIRTY KILLER?

988
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,216
YOU APOLOGIZE. NOW.

989
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:50,181
NOW!

990
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:10,070
MATTHEW!

991
01:15:10,114 --> 01:15:11,507
MATTHEW!

992
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,423
MATTHEW!

993
01:15:17,817 --> 01:15:19,689
MATTHEW, WAIT!

994
01:15:22,866 --> 01:15:24,520
OH, MATT, I AM SO SORRY.

995
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:26,652
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU DID TO CHERRY
TO MAKE HIM CRAZY,

996
01:15:26,696 --> 01:15:29,307
BUT NO WOMAN
IS WORTH DYING FOR!

997
01:15:43,887 --> 01:15:46,629
Matt:
...DUST TO DUST.

998
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:47,804
IN SURE AND CERTAIN HOPE

999
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:51,677
OF THE RESURRECTION
UNTO ETERNAL LIFE.

1000
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:53,070
WE BROUGHT NOTHING
INTO THIS WORLD,

1001
01:15:53,113 --> 01:15:55,725
AND IT'S CERTAIN
WE CAN TAKE NOTHING OUT.

1002
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:56,813
THE LORD GAVE,

1003
01:15:56,856 --> 01:15:58,771
AND THE LORD
HATH TAKEN AWAY.

1004
01:15:58,815 --> 01:16:00,860
BLESSED BE
THE NAME OF THE LORD.

1005
01:16:00,904 --> 01:16:02,166
AMEN.

1006
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:13,699
Matt: BOOTS.

1007
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:20,837
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO RUN ME OFF, MR. GARTH.

1008
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,142
I'M GONE.

1009
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:25,711
YOU ARE GONE
IF YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD

1010
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:29,410
AGAINST JACK
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

1011
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:37,549
BUT IF YOU STILL WANT
TO GO WITH US TO ABILENE,

1012
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,725
YOU'LL GET YOUR PAY,
JUST LIKE THE REST.

1013
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:44,295
THANK YOU,
MR. GARTH.

1014
01:16:56,046 --> 01:16:58,483
MR. GROOT TOLD US
ABOUT DUNSON.

1015
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:02,226
YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT NEEDS
TO BE DONE FOR US.

1016
01:17:02,269 --> 01:17:04,402
PLEASE, PUSH ON AHEAD.

1017
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:09,015
DOES THERE HAVE TO BE
MORE KILLING?

1018
01:17:09,059 --> 01:17:10,669
GET YOUR HERD TO MARKET,

1019
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:14,238
AND THEN DECIDE
WHAT TO DO ABOUT DUNSON.

1020
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:15,282
PLEASE.

1021
01:17:58,891 --> 01:18:00,719
'EVENING, GENTLEMEN.
WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS?

1022
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:03,591
YOU TRAVELING
WITH A TRAIL HERD?

1023
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:04,767
WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

1024
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:07,421
THOMAS DUNSON.
I'M A RANCHER FROM TEXAS.

1025
01:18:07,465 --> 01:18:08,988
THE HERD'S MINE.

1026
01:18:09,032 --> 01:18:12,252
THESE MEN HERE ARE DEPUTIZED
TO HELP PUNISH THE THIEVES.

1027
01:18:12,296 --> 01:18:13,776
HOW FAR AHEAD ARE THEY?

1028
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:17,475
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT
OR WRONG OF THIS IS, MISTER.

1029
01:18:17,518 --> 01:18:19,259
THEY SAVED US
FROM THE COMANCHES.

1030
01:18:19,303 --> 01:18:23,829
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
IT'S RIGHT TO HELP YOU
HUNT 'EM DOWN,

1031
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:26,832
BUT YOU AND YOUR MEN
ARE WELCOME TO SHARE
WHAT'S IN OUR POT.

1032
01:18:29,574 --> 01:18:31,010
WELL, THEY CAN'T BE
TOO FAR AHEAD.

1033
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:32,882
MR. DUNSON.

1034
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:34,666
I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1035
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,624
ABOUT MATTHEW GARTH.

1036
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,198
IT'S YOUR BEEF IN THE POT,

1037
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:47,635
SO THERE'S NO NEED
TO LET PRIDE STOP YOU.

1038
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,726
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
GO AHEAD AND EAT.

1039
01:18:50,769 --> 01:18:52,379
AMY, PLEASE GO ASK
COLONEL PRUITT

1040
01:18:52,423 --> 01:18:54,817
FOR A PLATE
FOR MR. DUNSON.

1041
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,036
YOU LOOK TRAIL-WORN, SIR.

1042
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,646
I HAVE SOME
MEDICINAL WHISKEY.

1043
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:00,605
WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOME?

1044
01:19:00,648 --> 01:19:02,781
YOU TRYIN' TO KILL ME
WITH KINDNESS?

1045
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:04,217
MORE OR LESS.

1046
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:11,703
MATTHEW LEFT WITH YOUR COWS
TWO DAYS AGO.

1047
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,314
THAT IS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

1048
01:19:14,358 --> 01:19:16,316
IF I CAN BELIEVE YOU.

1049
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:19,102
I DON'T CARE
WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT.

1050
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:20,843
WELL.

1051
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,670
THATI CAN BELIEVE.

1052
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:24,760
YOU INTEND TO KILL HIM,

1053
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:28,546
AND YOU NEED THEM
TO HELP YOU.

1054
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:29,808
NO, I DON'T NEED
THEM TO HELP ME,

1055
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:31,723
AND, YES, I DO
INTEND TO KILL HIM.

1056
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,944
WHY? BECAUSE HE TOOK
YOUR HERD TO SAVE IT FROM YOU.

1057
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:39,209
THANK YOU.

1058
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:43,300
PLEASE.

1059
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:52,483
MR. DUNSON, DO YOU REALLY
KNOW MATTHEW GARTH?

1060
01:19:52,526 --> 01:19:55,486
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.
16 YEARS.

1061
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:57,531
AND YET IN A FEW
DAYS AND NIGHTS,

1062
01:19:57,575 --> 01:19:59,707
I THINK I KNOW HIM BETTER.

1063
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:02,623
HE HATED GOING AGAINST YOU,

1064
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:04,669
BUT HE DID IT OUT OF LOVE.

1065
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,890
LIKE HELL HE DID.

1066
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:10,893
I RAISED HIM AS MY OWN SON
IN ALL BUT NAME.

1067
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:12,895
EVERYTHING WAS GOING
TO BE HIS--

1068
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:15,811
LAND, CATTLE, ALL OF IT,

1069
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:18,204
AND HE SPIT ON IT.

1070
01:20:18,248 --> 01:20:19,640
AND HE SPIT ON ME.

1071
01:20:21,642 --> 01:20:24,384
NOW, A MAN DOES THAT TO ME,
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

1072
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,647
SIMPLE.

1073
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,825
AND FOOLISH.

1074
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:31,739
YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM?

1075
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,873
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

1076
01:20:34,917 --> 01:20:36,222
THE WAY YOU TALK.

1077
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:39,747
THAT GUN YOU GOT
OVER THERE IN THAT BOX.

1078
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:40,836
IF YOU THOUGHT--

1079
01:20:40,879 --> 01:20:44,274
I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING.

1080
01:20:44,317 --> 01:20:47,581
BUT I WOULD HAVE TRIED,
STUPIDLY,

1081
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,888
JUST AS YOU WILL
WHEN YOU FIND MATTHEW.

1082
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:56,460
YOU KNOW, I HAD A WOMAN
FELT THAT WAY ABOUT ME ONCE.

1083
01:20:56,503 --> 01:20:57,678
I LOST HER.

1084
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:04,642
NOW I GOT NEITHER WIFE
NOR SON.

1085
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:17,176
I'M GOING TO GO
OUT THERE IN THE DARK

1086
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,526
AND CATCH A FEW HOURS' SLEEP.

1087
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:20,614
YOU WANT TO KILL ME...

1088
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,227
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR CHANCE.

1089
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:41,809
Buster: I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK WE'RE LOST.

1090
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:44,856
EITHER THAT, OR THERE
AIN'T NO SUCH A PLACE
AS ABILENE.

1091
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,684
WE'RE GONNA WIND UP
IN CANADA,

1092
01:21:46,727 --> 01:21:49,513
DRIVING THIS HERD
UP AND DOWN AN ICEBERG.

1093
01:21:49,556 --> 01:21:50,993
WE'LL FIND IT.

1094
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:52,995
IF WE DO, BE AWFUL TOUGH
IF THE RAILROAD AIN'T THERE.

1095
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:54,866
IT'S GOTTA BE THERE.

1096
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,302
BUT IF IT AIN'T?

1097
01:21:56,346 --> 01:21:58,174
WE'LL KEEP DRIVING
TILL WE FIND IT.

1098
01:21:58,217 --> 01:22:00,306
OR TILL DUNSON FINDS US.

1099
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:01,960
WHOA. WHAT WAS THAT?

1100
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:03,396
I HEARD SOMETHING.

1101
01:22:10,142 --> 01:22:12,840
YEE-HAW!

1102
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,686
Man: MAKE WAY! MAKE WAY!
WE'RE COMING IN!

1103
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:35,951
WHOO-HAH!

1104
01:22:35,994 --> 01:22:38,214
LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT!

1105
01:22:38,257 --> 01:22:39,345
MOVE OVER!

1106
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:40,825
MOVE OVER!

1107
01:22:47,832 --> 01:22:48,833
LOOK OUT!

1108
01:22:58,364 --> 01:23:00,062
Woman: HI, BOYS!

1109
01:23:22,867 --> 01:23:25,217
WHOA. WHOA.

1110
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:27,959
OKAY, MOVE ALONG.
MOVE ALONG.

1111
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,633
Man:
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

1112
01:24:00,905 --> 01:24:03,168
Melville: I HOPE
YOU REALIZE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE, MR. GARTH.

1113
01:24:03,212 --> 01:24:04,865
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE WOULD'VE DONE

1114
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:06,215
IF YOU HADN'T HUNG OUT
A WELCOME SIGN.

1115
01:24:09,566 --> 01:24:12,090
LET'S TALK
A LITTLE BUSINESS.

1116
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:14,223
MR. GARTH--MAKE THAT MATT.

1117
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:17,095
MATT?

1118
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:20,664
I AM THE GREENWOOD
TRAINING COMPANY
OF ILLINOIS,

1119
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:22,883
AND I'D LIKE TO BUY
YOUR HERD.

1120
01:24:22,927 --> 01:24:24,711
THE WHOLE SHOOTIN' MATCH?

1121
01:24:24,755 --> 01:24:26,757
EVERY LAST COW.

1122
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,585
WHAT'S YOUR PRICE?

1123
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:33,111
UH...

1124
01:24:33,155 --> 01:24:34,852
I'M KIND OF NEW AT THIS.

1125
01:24:34,895 --> 01:24:36,767
CAN YOU MAKE ME AN OFFER?

1126
01:24:37,855 --> 01:24:38,812
ALL RIGHT.

1127
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:41,728
$20.

1128
01:24:41,772 --> 01:24:44,514
A HEAD?

1129
01:24:47,908 --> 01:24:49,823
MR. MELVILLE,

1130
01:24:49,867 --> 01:24:52,522
YOU JUST BOUGHT YOURSELF
A HELL OF A LOT OF BEEF!

1131
01:24:52,565 --> 01:24:55,960
I'D GET THAT CONDUCTOR
TO BLOW HIS WHISTLE AGAIN
IF HE WAS HERE,

1132
01:24:56,003 --> 01:24:57,744
BUT BEIN' AS HE AIN'T...

1133
01:24:57,788 --> 01:24:59,616
YEE-HAW!

1134
01:25:01,574 --> 01:25:03,098
MAN'S GOT A RIGHT
TO SCREAM LIKE THAT

1135
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:05,709
THREE TIMES IN HIS LIFE--

1136
01:25:05,752 --> 01:25:09,191
WHEN HE MARRIES,
WHEN HIS KIDS ARE BORN...

1137
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:14,065
AND WHEN HE FINISHES A JOB
HE WAS CRAZY TO START.

1138
01:25:19,288 --> 01:25:22,639
WELL, MATT, YOU'VE MADE
TOM DUNSON RICH.

1139
01:25:22,682 --> 01:25:24,641
THAT'S ALL YOU OWE HIM.

1140
01:25:24,684 --> 01:25:26,773
YOU GOT ME
AND THREE SADDLE MATES
RIGHT HERE

1141
01:25:26,817 --> 01:25:29,124
IF YOU DECIDE
TO RIDE NORTH.

1142
01:25:31,169 --> 01:25:33,171
I KNOW THAT.

1143
01:25:33,215 --> 01:25:34,303
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

1144
01:25:34,346 --> 01:25:35,739
IF I DON'T GET IN LINE
FOR THAT BATH,

1145
01:25:35,782 --> 01:25:37,697
I'M GOING TO HELL
SMELLING LIKE A SKUNK.

1146
01:25:37,741 --> 01:25:40,178
YOU GUYS GO ON
AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

1147
01:25:41,919 --> 01:25:43,312
Buster:
WHERE'S THAT SALOON?

1148
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:45,575
I WANT TO MEET
THEM PURDY LADIES!

1149
01:26:04,376 --> 01:26:05,290
COME IN.

1150
01:27:14,054 --> 01:27:15,230
HEY.

1151
01:27:16,318 --> 01:27:17,710
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1152
01:27:22,498 --> 01:27:24,456
IT'S JUST THAT...

1153
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,284
I WANT YOU ALIVE.

1154
01:27:27,503 --> 01:27:28,547
COME WITH ME.

1155
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:29,896
THERE'S A GOOD LIFE
IN COLORADO.

1156
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,984
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1157
01:27:31,028 --> 01:27:32,682
I WANT THAT TOO.

1158
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:35,119
BUT IF I DON'T--

1159
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:39,819
IF I CAN TURN MY BACK
ON MY PAST, WHY CAN'T YOU?

1160
01:27:39,863 --> 01:27:40,994
'CAUSE IF
I DON'T FACE HIM,

1161
01:27:41,038 --> 01:27:44,520
I'D NEVER BE A MAN
THAT YOU COULD LOVE.

1162
01:27:44,563 --> 01:27:45,999
THAT IS SUCH A FOOLISH
THING TO SAY.

1163
01:27:46,043 --> 01:27:48,698
I'D LOVE YOU
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID.

1164
01:27:51,004 --> 01:27:53,703
THEN YOU'LL LOVE ME
IF I HAVE TO DO THIS.

1165
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,528
MR. GROOT!

1166
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:23,749
MR. GROOT!

1167
01:29:27,797 --> 01:29:28,841
HE'S COMING...

1168
01:29:28,885 --> 01:29:30,452
AND HE'S ALONE.

1169
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:31,888
GO TELL MATTHEW.

1170
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:13,364
Groot: NOW HOLD ON A MINUTE
AND THINK ABOUT THIS--

1171
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,453
HE GOT YOU TOP DOLLAR.

1172
01:30:15,497 --> 01:30:17,847
DRAFT'S IN YOUR NAME.

1173
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:19,849
HE DID IT FOR YOU, TOM.

1174
01:30:21,372 --> 01:30:22,765
YOU STAY OUT OF IT.

1175
01:30:56,102 --> 01:30:58,235
GO ON, MATTHEW.

1176
01:30:58,278 --> 01:30:59,454
DRAW.

1177
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:02,848
I SAID DRAW.

1178
01:31:19,735 --> 01:31:21,258
WHAT KIND OF MAN ARE YOU?

1179
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:27,699
NOW, YOU TOLD ME ONCE
NEVER TO DO THAT TO YOU AGAIN.

1180
01:31:29,309 --> 01:31:32,095
BY GOD, I'LL GET YOU
TO FIGHT.

1181
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:51,723
ALL RIGHT,
STAY THERE IN THE DIRT

1182
01:31:51,767 --> 01:31:53,420
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

1183
01:31:55,901 --> 01:31:59,731
THE REST OF YOU--
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A BUNCH OF COW THIEVES.

1184
01:31:59,775 --> 01:32:01,864
I'M GONNA SEE YOU ALL HANG!

1185
01:32:35,027 --> 01:32:36,333
GO ON, GET UP.

1186
01:32:57,484 --> 01:32:59,182
DAMN YOU!

1187
01:32:59,225 --> 01:33:01,750
HAVE YOU NO SENSE AT ALL?

1188
01:33:01,793 --> 01:33:04,100
LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING--
TRYING TO KILL
WITH YOUR FISTS

1189
01:33:04,143 --> 01:33:06,406
THE PERSON YOU LOVE.

1190
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:08,452
YES, YOU LOVEEACH OTHER.

1191
01:33:08,495 --> 01:33:10,802
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YET?

1191
01:33:11,305 --> 01:34:11,490
