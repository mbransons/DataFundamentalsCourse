I might as well make the best of it.

Sisters, the three of 'em.

These are your tables.

58

See if you can make a
waiter out of this person.

59
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,822

under them like that.

64
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,204
When they get up, you pull
the chair back, like that.

65
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,080
- Oh they go to sit down, I push it in.

66
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,164
- Under.
- When they get up, I--.

- Sure, sure.

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,901
You see, that is I'd like a
table in the corner somewhere.

166
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,145
- Here I am, Daddy.

167
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,823
- Oh, this way, please.

168
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:54,899
Hey, you.

169
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,702
- 0h, excuse me.

170
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,038
How do you do?

171
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,040
- Thank you.

172
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,495
- Good evening, folks.

173
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,205
Wanna start off with a little soup?

174
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,082
- Yeah, I don't like soup.

175
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,083
- Give me the reason.

176
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,418
- I don't have to give any reason

177
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,919
other than I don't like soup!

178
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,337
- Well, maybe the young lady
would like to have some soup.

179
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,630
- She doesn't like soup either.

180
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,465
- It's good soup.

181
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,799
- I don't care how good it is!

182
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,593
We don't want any soup!

183
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,511
- Well somebody's gotta eat the soup!

184
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,888
- Well, feed it to the chef.

185
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,222
- The chef is souped up now!

186
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,141
- Daddy, I think I will have some soup.

187
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,434
- You'll do nothing of the sort.

188
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,268
- Oh, Daddy!

189
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,605
- I mean after all, don't
talk back to your father.

190
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,981
- I'm not her father.

191
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,149
- Well then why don't
you let the young lady

192
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,358
have some soup then, why don't ya?

193
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,818
- All right, give her soup.

194
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,778
Give me some soup.

195
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,071
Give us both some soup!

196
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,864
- I'm sorry, but we've run out of soup.

197
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,074
- You've got it here on the menu!

198
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:44,908
- Well, I'll take it out of the menu.

199
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,742
I mean after all, we ain't gonna give

200
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,160
you nothin' we ain't got in there.

201
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,578
So.

202
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,246
I'm awful glad he ain't your father.

203
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,082
(grumbling)

204
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,009
Here, wash it down.

205
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,294
I mean because I think
you're awfully cute.

206
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,723
- Oh boy.
(whistling)

207
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,467
(crashing)

208
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,301
- Oh, Gregory.

209
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,427
- Mr. Bannister.

210
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,261
- Is Moose Matson here?

211
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,930
- Certainly, Mr. Moose
Matson is right over there--

212
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,473
- All right, all right, all right.

213
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,859
- Mr. Bannister?

214
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,563
Thanks for leading me to the Moose.

215
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,190
- Look Charlie, this is
not the time or the place

216
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,191
to start anything with the Moose.

217
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,109
- Start anything?

218
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:19,943
I'm here to finish it.

219
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,319
- Maybe he's afraid you
will double cross him.

220
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,572
- I will in exactly 15 minutes from now.

221
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,990
I'll prove it to the district attorney.

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,117
- Prove what?

223
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,671
- Never mind, just whisper
payroll job to the Moose.

224
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,163
He'll know.

225
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:32,997
- You sure?

226
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,083
- Yeah, also he'll know I'm
the only guy in the world

227
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,293
that can pin it on him.
- He never mentioned it to me.

228
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,878
- Why should he?

229
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,475
You're only his head front
man, sidekick and backstabber.

230
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,093
- How much of it do you want?

231
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:45,895
- All of it.

232
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,358
But the Moose being a
friend, I'll settle for half.

233
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,817
- Hello, hello, hello, girls.
- Hi, Moose.

234
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,694
- Meet my top man, Mr. Bannister.

235
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,571
- Hello, come on, sit down.
- Hello, girls.

236
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,738
- Yes, let's make it a foursome.

237
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,657
- Here's that legal matter you
dictated to your mouthpiece.

238
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,825
- 0h.

239
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,993
Well, will it hold up in court?

240
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,369
- Well, he's the lawyer.

241
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,913
Says it's screwy but it's ironclad.

242
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,665
There's something else.

243
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,135
I just ran into Charlie Smith.

244
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,420
- Girls, 90 powder your
noses or something, will ya?

245
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,347
Go on, beat it.

246
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,840
- Don't be long, Moose.

247
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,716
- Okay, honey.

248
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,342
- Come on, gentlemen.

249
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,177
- Well?

250
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,011
- Charlie Smith said that you beat him

251
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,512
to that Worthington payroll job.

252
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,222
And he wants a 50l50 cut to keep quiet.

253
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,849
- That cap pistol hoodlum!

254
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,100
- Then he said if you don't come across,

255
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,893
he'll tell the D.A..

256
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,311
- Well let the stool pigeon sing!

257
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,937
I'll knock him off his perch.

258
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,189
- If you've still got the cash,

259
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,024
I think we oughta make him an offer.

260
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,025
- I've got it all right.

261
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,359
But you tell him that he's gotta

262
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,320
find it before he can cut in.

263
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,654
- Where is it, Moose?

264
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,323
I'm on your side, surely you can tell me.

265
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,074
- Sure.

266
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,005
The hiding place for
my money is in my head.

267
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,081
(chuckling)

268
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,417
- Is everybody happy?

269
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,752
- [All] Yes!

270
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,545
- [Ted] Then everybody dance!

271
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,671
- Well, come on, Daddy.

272
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,006
Didn't you hear what Ted Lewis said?

273
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,049
Everybody dance.

274
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,342
- Oh, no, no, no, thank you.

275
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,677
- Aw but, all right then, I'll
find myself another partner!

276
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,314
- If you do, I leave.

277
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,891
- [Ferdinand] Put it right down here.

278
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,309
- Your food, sir.

279
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,362
- Eat it yourself!

280
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,698
- I Will.

281
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,857
Yeah, boy!

282
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,816
- Come on, if you wanna
be a kind gentleman,

283
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,692
it's okay with me.

284
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,945
- Is everybody happy?

285
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,404
- Everybody!

286
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,280
Me too.

287
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,323
- Sure.

288
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,783
- Hey, come on, what do you call this?

289
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,867
- Duck.

290
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,202
What's the matter, what happened?

291
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,328
- Somebody throw something?

292
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,746
- No, no, no, that's the duck.

293
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,248
- Don't you mean, oh, I
thought you meant the--

294
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,082
- No, no.

295
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,667
Now come on, I want two legs.

296
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,918
- You want two legs?
- Two legs.

297
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,002
- How many legs you
think is on this thing?

298
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,836
- Well wait a minute, wait a minute,

299
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,671
you can't do it that way.

300
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,505
Wait a minute, now what are you,

301
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,548
put that down before
you cut your hands off.

302
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,383
- I'm spankin' it!

303
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,051
I'm spankin' it.
- Well pull a leg off.

304
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,594
I don't care how I get it.

305
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,720
That's it, that's it.

306
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,596
Come on, give.

307
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,430
(groaning)

308
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,265
The boss, the boss!

309
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,182
- You're both fired!

310
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,184
- Thanks for our old
job at the gas station!

311
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:58,987
- Get out!

312
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,856
- I'm sorry we was
thrown out of that place.

313
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,483
- Ah, keep quiet.

314
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,359
- I apologize.

315
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,193
- Never mind.

316
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,420
♪ Now when my baby smiles at me I

317
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,992
(humming)
- Will you give me that!

318
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,618
- You want it?
- Yes, give--

319
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,745
(splashing)

320
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,330
- Oh.
- Now look what you did!

321
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,456
- I'm sorry, Chuck.

322
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,001
- You're sorry!
(slapping)

323
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:23,835
- Look what you did to me now!

324
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:24,669
- Let's get to work.

325
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,586
- Now we're a couple of shadows.

326
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,171
Okay, I'll get to work.
- Yes, you oughta be

327
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,673
ashamed of yourself.

328
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,882
- I am, Chuck.

329
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,718
But I'm gonna make you proud
of me one of these fine days.

330
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,552
- [Chuck] What do you mean?

331
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,804
- I'm not gonna be a gas
attendant all my life.

332
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,264
I'm gonna have a night club of my own.

333
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,265
Some day I'm gonna have Ted Lewis

334
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,391
and the Andrews Sisters work for me.

335
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,767
- You own a nightclub!

336
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,894
- Don't look now but your eye is dripping.

337
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,729
- Quiet!

338
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,230
You just had us thrown out of one.

339
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,064
- Well, I'm sorry.
- And if we don't get

340
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,607
on the job, they'll have
to us thrown out here.

341
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,495
- (humming), Okay.

342
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,821
All right, Chuck, I'll work hard,

343
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,167
but I don't intend to be a
gas attendant all my life.

344
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:02,915
Hey, Chuck.

345
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,626
- Oh, don't bother me, Ferdie, I'm busy.

346
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,170
And stop playing with those balloons.

347
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,838
- [Ferdinand] I'm gonna
try and blow 'em up.

348
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,340
- Put those balloons away.
- Okay.

349
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,799
- [Chuck] Come on, get
on the job, we're busy.

350
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,259
What's the matter with you?

351
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,635
- Hey, Chuck?
- What?

352
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,137
- [Ferdinand] Eight gallons for $1,

353
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,013
that's pretty cheap, ain't it?

354
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,057
- Yes, of course that don't include ethyl.

355
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,142
- [Ferdinand] You mean ethyl
is a little more expensive?

356
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:21,976
- Well certainly it's up.

357
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,603
If a car drove up here
and asked you for ethyl,

358
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,437
what would you do?

359
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,189
- I'd say that she
don't work here anymore.

360
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,148
- No, no, no.

361
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,400
You'd put ethyl in the car.
- Why would I do that?

362
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,234
I don't even know the girl!

363
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,402
- Oh, right.
- She's got no right

364
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,779
hangin' around here.

365
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,238
- [Chuck] What can we do
for you, check your oil?

366
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,073
- [Man] No.

367
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,907
- You know we've got a special on.

368
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,950
(balloon popping)
(Ferdie groaning)

369
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,118
- [Ferdinand] I think you got a blowout!

370
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,370
- Just one of his pranks.

371
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,371
What can we do for you?

372
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,706
- I just want to park it
for a couple of hours.

373
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,666
- Why certainly, nothing but service.

374
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,001
Ferdie, park the man's car.

375
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:47,835
- Right!
- Be careful with it.

376
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,504
- Be careful with it
chief, I just had it waxed.

377
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,381
- Don't you worry about think around here.

378
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,383
(car engine rumbling)

379
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,550
(tires squealing)

380
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,719
(crashing)

381
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,846
- He should have his drivers
license taken away from him.

382
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,109
- I'll see that he does,
as soon as he gets one.

383
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,822
(dog barking)

384
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,107
- All right, all right.

385
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,441
All right, what's the matters?

386
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,068
I know.

387
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,904
(car horn honking)

388
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,863
- Yes, sir.
- 10 gallons of gas,

389
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,864
and I'm in a hurry.

390
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,949
- Check your oil?
- No!

391
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,908
- Okay.
- Want some oil?

392
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,118
- No!
- I just asked the man.

393
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:20,952
Now check the water.

394
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,328
- The water's okay, hurry with the gas.

395
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,830
- By the way we have a sale on the day.

396
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,331
With every four quarts
of Golden Nector oil

397
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,499
we give you pint of Diefly.

398
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,960
It kills moths in rugs,
as well as bugs and slugs.

399
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,086
- 10 gallons of gas.

400
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:30,920
- Want some oil?

401
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,754
- No!

402
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,588
- What's the matter, you a tough guy?

403
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,423
- Yes!
- Wait a minute--

404
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,257
- All right.
- You're wasting

405
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,883
the man's time, clean
up the back of the car.

406
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,176
- Okay.
- Say, how about a nice,

407
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,219
new set of tires?

408
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,053
Here's our gift card.

409
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,680
Now when that's fully punched,
you get new set of dishes.

410
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,390
The little lady'll enjoy that.

411
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,224
- I'm not married.

412
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,058
- Want some oil?

413
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,561
- I don't want any tires or
dishes or fly spray or grease.

414
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,354
And most of all, I don't want oil!

415
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,324
- Well in case you want some, we got it.

416
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,703
- Hurry up with that gas, will ya?

417
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,364
Quit stalling around. Get
the gas in there, will ya?

418
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,001
- [Chuck] All right.

419
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,161
- What do you know?

420
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,298
(humming)

421
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,209
(whistling)

422
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,044
(gun clicking)

423
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,046
Ain't loaded.
(gunshot banging)

424
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,964
- What was that?

425
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,549
- Say, that looks like Moose Matson!

426
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,477
- Moose Matson?

427
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,595
You're right.
(siren wailing)

428
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,065
- What are you doing in there?

429
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,393
(tires squealing)

430
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,563
(gunshots banging)

431
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,782
Hey, what's the big idea?

432
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,204
(gunshots banging)

433
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,791
(tires squealing)

434
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,872
- I wanna get outta here.

435
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,081
I wanna get back to the gas station.

436
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,458
I wanna--
- What is it you want?

437
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,292
- I want my mama.

438
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,294
- Get over here and drive.

439
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,140
(gunshots banging)

440
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,550
Come on, hey you. You get
up there and help him out.

441
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,384
- 0h, all right.

442
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,012
- Make it snappy.
- Yes, sir. (gunshots banging)

443
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,932
(whimpering)
(whistling)

444
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:06,766
- Look out there!

445
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:10,269
(tires screeching)

446
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,157
(gunshots banging)

447
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,320
- Whoa!

448
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,154
- Ah!

449
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:24,126
(tires screeching)
- Oh, oh, oh!

450
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,372
It's awful quiet, ain't it?

451
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,581
(groaning)

452
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,134
- Pull over someplace, will ya?

453
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,678
Lefty, get a doctor, will ya?

454
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,221
- Lefty, who is Lefty?

455
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,764
- I don't know.
- Lefty isn't here.

456
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,485
(sirens wailing)

457
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,324
- "I, Sidney Matson, known as Moose Matson

458
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,660
"being of sound mind and under no duress,

"Whereas anybody who would associate

461

00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,103
- That's us!
- Yeah.

470
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,271
You mean, we get his money?

471
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,273
- Well there is none as far as we know.

472
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,234
Moose Matson always said that
he kept his money in his head.

473
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,694
But we never learned what he meant.

474
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,696
No the only tangible
asset bequeathed to you,

475
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,449
is a tavern on what
used to be Highway 129.

476
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,658
- A tavern?

477
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,576
That's a hotel.
- Yeah.

478
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,910
- Now that's funny.

479
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,370
One minute you work in a gas station,

480
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,788
the next minute you own a hotel.

481
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,249
- Next minute you're back in the station.

482
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,302
- Send Mr. Smith in.

483
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,962
I've taken the liberty of
asking my associate, Mr. Smith,

484
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,464
to accompany you to your property

485
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,965
and officially turn over the keys.

486
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,175
- You sure it won't be too much bother?

487
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,426
- [Mr. Bannister] Oh, no bother at all.

488
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,970
Just one of the conveniences we supply.

489
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,388
Well hello, Charlie.

490
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,931
Meet Mr. Murray and Mr. Jones.

491
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,475
- Mr. Murray, Mr. Jones.

492
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,893
- [Ferdinand] Hello.

493
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,312
- These are the beneficiaries
of the Matson will.

494
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,355
- Oh yes, I know all about them.

495
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,689
- Are you sure it won't be too much

496
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,649
trouble to take us there?

497
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,483
- Not at all.

498
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,984
I'll see that you're well taken care of.

499
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,860
- [Ferdinand] 0h, thanks.

500
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,820
- Now since your property's
off the main highway,

501
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,239
we'll take a private bus to get there.

502
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,366
I'm making all arrangements.

503
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,201
Now you meet me tomorrow
morning at eight o'clock

504
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,035
at 4th and Elm.

505
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,119
- We'll be there.
- Yeah.

506
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,871
- Oh, incidentally the bus is operated

507
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,873
by a man named Harry Hoskins.

508
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,458
You'll see his name on the car.

509
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,626
- [Ferdinand] I hope we're
not putting you out any.

510
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,595
- Not at all.

511
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,381
It's gonna be a pleasure to
take you boys for a ride.

512
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,716
I'll see ya tomorrow.

513
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,009
- He's gonna take us for a ride!

514
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,927
(whistling)

515
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,970
Hey Chuck, we don't want no roadhouse.

516
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,681
Anything you get for nothin' is no good.

517
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,682
Let's get back to the gas station.

518
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,516
- Oh that's fine.

519
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,685
Just when you get an
opportunity to advance yourself,

520
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,103
a chance to become somebody,

521
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,480
you wanna be a gas station attendant!

522
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,368
(gunshots banging)

523
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,912
- You missed 'em!

524
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,071
(people gasping)

525
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,447
- [Woman] Oh hi baby, let's go.

526
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,615
(whistling)

527
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,504
Just me just one.
- Please, give her the letter.

528
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,914
- Hey, here's the bus, Harry Hoskins.

529
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,332
- Oh yeah, Harry Hoskins.

530
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,001
- Hey, what are you doing in that car?

531
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,003
- Oh, I'm Chuck Murray.

532
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:23,963
(Ferdinand groaning)

533
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,381
All right, behave yourself.

534
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,340
This is Ferdie Jones.
- Hi.

535
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,925
- We're supposed to pick up a ride here.

536
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,260
- Yeah, our friend Mr. Smith,

537
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,261
he said he'd make all arrangements.

538
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,137
- Yeah.
- 0h, Charlie.

539
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,763
- Yeah.
- Oh so you're the gentlemen.

540
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,597
- That's us.
- Here, let me take

541
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,557
these bags.
- Give the man a hand.

542
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,433
- Okay, here you are.

543
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,892
- No, no, give him a hand with the bags!

544
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,852
- You said give the guy
a hand, so give my hand--

545
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,062
- Well all right, pick up
the bag and give it to him.

546
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,188
- [Ferdinand] Sure.

547
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,940
- Do you know anything
about the Forrester's Club?

548
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,442
- [Chuck] Yeah, yeah, I do.

549
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,693
- Oh, you know about the Forrester's Club?

550
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,527
(groaning)

551
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,695
- We inherited it.
- Oh you did?

552
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,447
- Yes, yes, that'll be the--

553
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,948
- Hey, which way you goin'?
- What's the matter?

554
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,408
- Why north of course.
- Sure.

555
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,617
- You're going north?
- Mm hm.

556
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,660
- Don't you wish you were goin' south?

557
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,453
- Why?

558
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,287
- That's the way your bag went.

559
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,590
- Well you know,

560
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,874
why you--
- We'll be leaving

561
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,001
as soon as the rest of
my passengers get here.

562
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,127
- Rest of the passengers?

563
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,253
I thought we were the only two.

564
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,421
Well, I--
- Mr. Hoskins?

565
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,422
- Yes.
- Oh, how do you do?

566
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,382
- I'm Norma Lind.
- Oh, yes, Miss Lind.

567
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,092
This is Mr. Murray, Mr. Jones.

568
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,802
- How do you do?
- Hello, hello, hello.

569
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,053
- Have I got time for some breakfast

570
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,888
and the drugstore before we leave?

571
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,181
- Oh yeah.
- Oh sure, we'll wait for you.

572
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,308
- Sure.
- Anytime I'll wait for you.

573
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,110
- Thanks.

574
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,686
- I'd love to buy
breakfast for you myself!

575
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,146
- Now what are you
trying to be, a cavalier?

576
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:22,980
- Yeah.
- Sure.

577
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,023
- What's a cavalier?
- A cavalier?

578
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,858
Well where I come from a cavalier is a man

579
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,735
who takes a girl out, wines and
dines her and takes her home

580
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,904
and says good night
without even kissing her.

581
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:30,738
- That's what you call a cavalier?

582
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,989
- Mm hm, where I come from.

583
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,948
- Where you come from.

584
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,909
Where I come from they call 'em suckers.

585
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,743
- Oh, well.

586
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,536
- Thanks all.
- Oh, Mr. Hoskins?

587
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,579
Mr. Hoskins!

588
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,081
(thudding)

589
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,501
- Why don't you look where
you're going? Are you blind?

590
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,336
- Line up and I hit you, didn't I?

591
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,806
- Come on, get up.

592
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,974
Did you get hurt?

593
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,759
- No, I'm all right.
- She's all right.

594
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,177
- Mr. Hoskins?
- This is Mr. Hoskins.

595
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,637
- Oh, Mr. Hoskins, I'm Miss Brewster,

596
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,014
Camille Brewster, the radio actress.

597
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,890
- Oh yes, Miss Brewster.

598
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,558
This is Mr. Murray and Mr. Jones.

599
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,476
- How do you do?

600
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,310
Suppose you two boys have heard me a lot

601
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,103
of times on the air too, huh?

602
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,355
(humming)
No?

603
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,148
Well see if you recognize me.

604
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,566
(screaming)

605
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,400
- Air raid alarm.

606
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,361
(imitating gunfire)

607
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,278
- Wait a minute.

608
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,905
That's the scream that opens
The Tales of Terror programs.

609
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,031
- Right?
- Right.

610
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:14,865
- I knew it.

611
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,783
- Yeah that was the scream, but no more.

612
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,701
- No?
- After 60 programs,

613
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,536
I got mad.

614
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,746
I told 'em I was an actress,
not just a sound effect.

615
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,331
So I quit!

616
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,833
Guess I'll have to go back to the movies.

617
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,792
- [Chuck] Movie actress?

618
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,095
- No, usherette.

619
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,212
- Something to drink, lady?

620
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,046
- Draw one.

621
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,297
- Draw one, right.

622
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,757
- May I have service, please?

623
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,675
- [Bartender] Yes, sir.

624
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,385
- How long ago was your
orange juice squeezed?

625
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,719
- Why, it's fresh this morning.

626
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,388
- What time this morning?

627
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,722
- Exactly an hour ago.

628
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,474
- Oh, that's exactly a
half an hour too long.

629
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,684
0h its vitamin C content

630
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,936
was deficient a half hour after squeezing.

631
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,938
People need vitamin C.

632
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,481
Now you take that girl over there.

633
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,984
Hyperthyroid, slight pituitary deficiency.

634
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,360
Yeah, she'd be much better off if she had

635
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,779
fewer eggs and drank more orange juice.

636
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,364
- I'm doing all right, brother.

637
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,198
- Yes, certainly.

638
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,909
I'm doing some special research on glands

639
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,369
and their vitamin consumption.

640
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,203
I'm a doctor.

641
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,162
- 0h huh.

642
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,623
If this is a line, it's
at least a new one.

643
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,084
- Oh no, no, I have my
credentials here some place.

644
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,470
I had them in my pocket.

645
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,172
Where could they be?

646
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,007
What happened to them?

647
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,467
And don't think I didn't see you do that.

648
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,302
(juice splashing)

649
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,887
- Mr. Jenkins.
- Yes?

650
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,221
- Can I squeeze him with my own hands?

651
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,347
- [Mr. Jenkins] What's
seems to be the trouble?

652
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,974
- I have just poured a glass of your

653
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,225
orange juice down the drain.

654
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,935
- I squeezed a fresh batch an hour ago.

655
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,397
- And it's now exact,
is that the right time?

656
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,700
- Yes.
- Oh, wow!

657
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,028
I beg your pardon.
(clanking)

658
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,363
- [Camille] Are you sure you
never heard me on the air?

659
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,000
- No.
- Camille Brewster?

660
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,669
You must have a cheap radio.

661
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,631
- [Dr. Jackson] Oh, sorry I'm late.

662
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,460
- [Norma] Sorry I'm late, mister.

663
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,128
- [Camille] Well, sorry
I'm late, I gotta go now.

664
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,796
Let's all go.
- No, I'm not gonna leave now,

665
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,672
I gotta wait for my friend Charlie Smith.

666
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,507
- Here comes Charlie Smith.

667
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,051
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello boys.

668
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,594
- How are ya?
- Hey, Charlie.

669
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,471
- I told you not to pick
up any other passengers.

670
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,847
- So I make a few extra bucks.

671
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,681
They won't bother you.

672
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,682
- [Ferdinand] Hello, Charlie, how are ya?

673
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,516
- Glad to see you, boys.
- Glad you're here.

674
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,226
- How are ya, Charlie?
- I'm sorry I'm late.

675
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,811
- That's all right.
- It's all right, Charlie.

676
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,614
Hey.

677
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,241
- The age of chiselry.
- Yeah.

678
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,609
- Hey Chuck, wait a minute.
- Huh?

679
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,027
- I'm surprised at you!

680
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:15,861
Ain't you got no manners?

681
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,779
- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

682
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,197
- Thank you, you're a little gentleman.

683
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,698
- Thank you, excuse me.

684
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,741
(thudding)
- Go ahead,

685
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,086
ruin the man's car.

686
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,424
(car engine rumbling)

687
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,417
- Don't you think you'll ruin your eyes

688
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,543
reading in a moving car?

689
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,806
- Oh I only have this much more to go.

690
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,855
- Mr. Jones, are you a married man?

691
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,973
- No.

692
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:44,942
- Neither am I.

693
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,602
He's old enough, ain't he?

694
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,436
- Oh, yes.

695
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,270
- Certainly I'm old enough.

696
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,480
I play games.

697
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,148
I play post office.

698
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:53,983
- Post office?

699
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,734
Oh, that's a kid's game.

700
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,912
- Not the way I play it.

701
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,128
(thunder booming)

702
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,554
(dramatic music)

703
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,307
- [Chuck] Sorry to take you
folks out of the way like this.

704
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,309
- Boy, what a mess!

705
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,185
See, what'd I tell you?

706
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,478
Old shutters!

707
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,479
- Looks like the setting for

708
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,324
The Death of The Howling Corpse.

709
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,608
- I don't like the looks of the road,

710
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,485
especially in this weather.

711
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,404
Now if it's all right
with these gentlemen,

712
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,905
I suggest we stay here for the night

713
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,741
and get an early start in the morning.

714
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,993
- No.
- That's fine by us.

715
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,412
- Yeah, I'd love to have you people.

716
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,663
- What do you think, Doctor?

717
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,497
- Well it's probably smartest thing to do.

718
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,583
There might be a washout
on the road ahead.

719
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,001
- Now you just leave everything to me.

720
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:54,835
Here, get in out of the rain,

721
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,462
while I'll get your bags.
- All right.

722
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,546
- Come on everybody.

723
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,715
It's a good thing we
got all these groceries.

724
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,601
Come on, please.

725
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,645
- Oh, can I use your flashlight?

726
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,683
(thunder booming)

727
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,517
- See, what'd I tell you, Chuck?

728
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,061
The first thing that goes is a shutter.

729
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:12,895
- Oh, quiet.

730
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,271
Are you sure you got the right key?

731
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,939
- Well, that's the only one.

732
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:16,899
- Let me try.
- Go ahead.

733
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,275
- I don't like this, Doc, I'm telling you.

734
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,318
I don't like these kinds of places.

735
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,153
Any place painted dark
brown I never cared for.

736
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,404
- He can't open it.
- He can't?

737
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,447
Here, hold the groceries, Chuck.

738
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,574
- What are you gonna do?
- Hey, stand back, stand back.

739
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,658
I'll show you how I used to do it

740
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,494
when I played cowboys and Indians.

741
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,589
I used to be a barricading ram, the ram.

742
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,958
Attack!

743
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,460
(thudding)

744
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,213
(light dramatic music)

745
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,381
- [Chuck] Are you all right, Ferdie?

746
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,216
- Who moved the door?

747
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,634
- What's on him, a cobweb?

748
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,895
- It ain't a wedding veil.

749
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,356
- Let's have a look around here.

750
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,646
- [Chuck] Well at least
the roof is still on.

751
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,314
- Oh, a spooky joint.

752
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,285
(engine backfiring)

753
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:02,986
- Check, what was that?

754
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,213
- [Chuck] I think we
should, just a minute.

755
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,408
- He's running away with our baggage!

756
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,243
- I should've known better than

757
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,744
to let that little snag my loan.

758
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,037
- What do you mean?
- That's the oldest chisel

759
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:12,871
in the world.

760
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,705
- What?
- What?

761
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,540
- The wildcat bus racket.

762
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,457
Collect the fares and the luggage

763
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,667
then get rid of the passengers.

764
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,668
- [Chuck] So we're stuck.

765
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,546
- Well, we'd better all get
in the house before we drown.

766
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,714
- Why ya dirty crook, you.

767
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,758
He run away with my toothbrush.

768
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,803
- Yeah and my new nightgown
and a pair of mules.

769
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,637
- You got a pair of mules?

770
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,807
- Certainly, now I gotta get
outta bed without my mules!

771
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,684
- You gotta get outta
bed without your mules?

772
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,770
- Yeah, I always keep a
pair of mules under my bed.

773
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,106
- Don't the board of health say nothin'?

774
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,607
What do you know?

775
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,109
You dirty crook!

776
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,110
(thunder booming)

777
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,611
- At least boys, we've
got a place to sleep.

778
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,904
- We might as well warm the place up.

779
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,865
I'll build a fire.
- Hey, Chuck.

780
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,950
- Hey check, oh, Chuck, oh, Chuck?

781
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,493
- All right, don't get excited, I'm here.

782
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,369
- [Ferdinand] Don't ever leave.

783
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,745
- I better keep this flashlight.

784
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,664
Find the cellar and
rustle up some real heat.

785
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,624
- [Chuck] You get busy with the food.

786
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,667
- Oh.
- There's something

787
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,928
wrong here, Ferdie.

788
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,548
Where are you, Ferdie.
(gurgling)

789
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,757
I feel a damp opening.

790
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,634
- [Ferdinand] You've got
your hand in my mouth!

791
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:12,608
- Oh, you.
(suspenseful music)

792
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,900
- Gee, that's a wonderful fire, Doc.

793
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,153
- Yes, I used to be a boy scout counselor.

794
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:26,955
- Do that again?

795
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:28,822
- What?

796
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,865
- Smile.

797
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,033
- Why?

798
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,993
- Hmm, not so bad.

799
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,536
- Oh no, they're very good.

800
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,370
Not a cavity in them.

801
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,330
I've always been very careful

802
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,925
to assimilate plenty of calcium.

803
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,712
- I wonder what's in
these cupboards over here?

804
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,007
(thudding)
- What's wrong with you two?

805
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,050
Is somebody goin' crazy?

806
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,509
(giggling)

807
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,011
- [Camille] Well there's
plenty of dishes, Mr. Murray.

808
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,013
- [Chuck] Yeah, that's fine.

809
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,150
(hissing)

810
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,478
- Nothing.

811
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,615
(hissing)

812
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,617
Whoa whoa!

813
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,026
Whoa whoa!

814
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,527
- Oh, behave yourself.

815
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,696
- I was playin' choochoo train.

816
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,739
- Never mind that.

817
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,491
- You never let me have no fun.

818
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,492
- Be quiet.

819
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,202
Take this bucket and go outside.

820
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,870
Maybe you'll find a rain barrel out there.

821
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,121
- What do you want water?
- Water.

822
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,289
- Go get it.
- Okay.

823
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,332
Yeah, you get it.

824
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,468
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

825
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:25,754
- I'm not gonna do nothin'.

826
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,130
- I know you're not.

827
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,006
- You don't have to get tough guy.

828
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,758
- [Camille] Give me a
hand with these dishes,

829
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,936
Mr. Murray, please.

830
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,598
(thunder booming)

831
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,933
- I don't wanna go.

832
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,309
- I said go outside!

833
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,435
- It's too dark.

834
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,938
And I don't wanna go outside
and walk in the dark by myself

835
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,398
with nobody to talk to.

836
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,149
- Why don't you talk to yourself.

837
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,317
- I get too many stupid answers.

838
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,318
- Go on outside!

839
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,444
- Okay.

840
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,279
(evil laughing)

841
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,196
- Yeah?

842
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,030
- I scared you, huh?

843
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,115
- Go on!

844
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,658
- Wait and if you don't see if I don't

845
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,159
get scared out here myself.

846
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,537
- Go on!
(door slamming)

847
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,757
(creaking)

848
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,504
(thudding)

849
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,890
- Oh, oh, please!

850
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,651
(squeaking)

851
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,163
(bucket thudding)

852
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,458
(groaning)

853
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,753
- [Chuck] How ya doin', Charlie?

854
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,830
- [Charlie] Okay, I'll be up shortly.

855
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,332
- [Chuck] Well supper's almost ready.

856
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,207
You need any help?

857
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,500
- [Charlie] No, I'll be all right.

858
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,179
- [Chuck] All right, make it snappy.

859
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,184
(dramatic music)

860
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,144
- [Camille] Soup's on, come and get it.

861
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:04,978
- Yeah, yeah.
- Soup, soup!

862
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,146
- Don't rush.
- Soup, a soup.

863
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,814
- Don't reach!
(groaning)

864
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,690
Don't reach.

865
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,025
If you want something, ask for it.

866
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,234
You have a tongue, haven't you?

867
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,277
- I can reach further with my hands.

868
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,153
- Never mind!

869
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:16,281
- Say, where's tall, dark and gruesome?

870
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,783
Better call him, Ferdie.

871
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,585
- Call him.

872
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,373
- [Ferdinand] Oh, Charlie?

873
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,874
- Louder!

874
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,094
Go on and call him!

875
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,347
Call him!

876
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,601
(door creaking)

877
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,691
- 0h, Charlie?

878
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,979
Oh, Charlie.

879
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,147
Charlie.

880
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,200
Hey, Charlie!

881
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,699
Oh, Char--

882
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,754
(footsteps pounding)

883
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,997
- Well?

884
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,124
- I'm scared.

885
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,458
I went into the kitchen.

886
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,335
I went over by the cellar steps.

887
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,921
I was lookin' down and it's very dark.

888
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,423
And I started to call him,

889
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,686
I said, "Oh, Charlie, oh, Charlie?"

890
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:20,814
He didn't answer.

891
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,817
- Maybe he isn't hungry anymore.

892
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:29,271
Well, let's eat before the soup gets cold.

893
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,073
- Okay.
- Yeah.

894
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,164
(slurping)

895
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,701
(spoon clanking)

896
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,505
(thunder booming)

897
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,836
- Just like mother used to make.

898
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:53,889
It stinks.

899
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,258
- It might be the water
used in making the soup.

900
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,394
- Well I'll find out.

901
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,771
Taste it, Ferdie.

902
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:04,816
It might be poison.

903
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,643
Go on, taste it.

904
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,519
- It might be poison.

905
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,438
- What are you worrying about?

906
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:16,411
Go on and taste it.

907
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,124
Go on, taste it!

908
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,261
(gasping)

909
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,971
- It's the water all right.

910
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,723
- From the pump, very peculiar.

911
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,557
- [Ferdinand] You said it.

912
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,861
- Well anyway, the beans
will be ready in a moment.

913
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,437
Isn't it a shame there isn't a band here?

914
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,606
We could dance between courses.

915
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,617
- Hey, wait a minute!

916
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,822
Just as I thought.

917
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,283
So at least we can have some music.

918
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,117
Look at all the records!

919
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,495
- 0h, Doctor, would you like to dance?

920
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,496
- Oh, I'd love to.

921
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,633
- Oh, good.
- I must learn someday.

922
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,846
("Blue Danube Waltz")

923
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,025
(thudding)

924
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,156
(water splashing)

925
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,644
(elbows thudding)

926
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,364
(humming)

927
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,377
(crashing)

928
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:08,124
(water splashing)
(thudding)

929
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,973
(water splashing)

930
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,323
(banging on bucket)

931
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,079
- Whew!

932
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,206
Whew!

933
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,743
Awfully damp in spots.

934
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,912
- I feel like a little
flower after a heavy rain.

935
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,913
I'm drooping.

936
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,373
- Flower?

937
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,167
Say, Smitty never did come back.

938
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,043
- That's right.

939
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,169
- I think I should look for him.

940
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,587
- Oh wait, I'll go with you.

941
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,131
Fernie, get me that lamp.

942
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,549
Doc, have you any more alcohol left?

943
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,925
- Yes, in that box.

944
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,301
- In here?
- Yes.

945
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,136
(clicking)

946
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:16,109
(suspenseful music)
(creaking)

947
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,435
- What did I do?

948
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,103
- [Norma] 0h!

949
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,855
Doctor, be careful.

950
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,189
- [Ferdinand] Uh oh.

951
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,441
- Ferdie, go see what's in there.

952
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,276
- Not me, I'm not curious.

953
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,194
- Ferdie, go see what's in there!

954
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,363
- I'd like to see you make me. (slapping)

955
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,239
You made me.

956
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,323
- Go on!
- Okay!

957
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,867
- [Camille] It reminds
me of the secret door

958
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,587
in The Case of the Mummy's Claw.

959
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,081
- What kind of a place is this?

960
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,916
- Well, it's a barroom.

961
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,084
- Barroom?

962
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,794
- It's a funny place to put it.

963
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,712
- Well this is the way they fooled

964
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,213
the police during prohibition.

965
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,300
- Say, you think there's
anything in those bottles?

966
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,010
A short beer or something?

967
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,802
I feel awful.

968
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,346
- Oh I'm sure if there is,
it must be bootleg, yeah.

969
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,556
- You remember how that used to wear

970
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,849
the enamel off your teeth?

971
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,477
- Yeah, once I drank six
bottles of that stuff.

972
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,311
I didn't ever stagger.

973
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,395
- Didn't stagger?

974
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,855
- I couldn't even move!

975
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,232
- But those were great days, remember?

976
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,035
- Who, me?

977
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:11,196
I was too young then, a mere child.

978
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,030
Are you kiddin'?

979
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,001
(suspenseful music)

980
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,868
- What's wrong?
(gasping)

981
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,453
What happened?

982
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,496
- Hey Chuck.
- What?

983
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,800
- [Ferdinand] Do you see it?

984
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,881
- Mr. Smith's carnation.

985
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,602
(dramatic music)

986
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,641
You girls better stay here.

987
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,443
It'll be safer.

988
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,479
- Come on, you're not a girl.

989
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,940
- Oh, when I was little boy,
I used to play with dolls.

990
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,066
- This way for you!

991
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,943
- Why don't you let me make up
my own mind once in a while?

992
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:50,860
- Come on, come on,

993
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,071
come on you.
- Oh.

994
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,865
(suspenseful music)

995
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,709
- 0h, Mr. Smith?

996
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,871
Mr. Smith!
- Wait a minute.

997
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,122
There's his flashlight.

998
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:03,925
- Why, so it is.

999
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,711
Well that's very peculiar.

1000
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,546
Mr. Smith?

1001
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,047
- Mr. Smith?
- 0h, Charlie?

1002
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,006
- Charlie Smith?

1003
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,809
- 0h, Charlie?

1004
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,510
Oh, Charlie.

1005
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,595
- Mr. Smith?
- Mr. Smith?

1006
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,347
- [Dr. Jackson] Mr. Smith, dinner's ready!

1007
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,015
- [Chuck] Charlie Smith?

1008
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,183
- [Dr. Jackson] What
could have become of him?

1009
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,309
- [Chuck] He must be down here.

1010
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,645
- Mr. Smith!
- Mr. Smith.

1011
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,063
That's strange.

1012
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:27,897
Mr. Smith?

1013
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,149
- Mr. Smith?
- Mr. Smith?

1014
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,484
- [Dr. Jackson] Mr. Smith, dinner's ready.

1015
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,318
- [Chuck] Charlie Smith?

1016
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,446
(suspenseful music)
- Mr. Smith.

1017
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,249
Mr. Smith?

1018
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,295
(dramatic music)

1019
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,373
(gasping)

1020
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,666
- Ah, ah!

1021
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,209
- Hey, hey, hey, come here, come here.

1022
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,878
What is it? Just a minute.
- Don't grab me.

1023
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,254
- Wait a minute, wait
a minute, what is it?

1024
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,881
- Somebody blew out the candle.

1025
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,300
- No, that's just the wind!

1026
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,634
- Since when does the wind eat garlic?

1027
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,719
- 0h now, calm down.

1028
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,803
- Here, take this.

1029
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,637
- Hm, okay.

1030
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,972
- What are you shaking about?

1031
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,223
- Don't let none of us
get nervous, that's all.

1032
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,349
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, we're all right.

1033
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,183
- Don't get nervous, that's all.

1034
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,101
- Yeah, everything's all right.

1035
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:05,935
- I'm calm, I'm calm.

1036
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,769
- I can see that.
- Come on.

1037
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,604
- Just take it easy, take it easy.

1038
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,438
- Not over there, not over there.

1039
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,397
- No, no, no, that's here.

1040
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,815
- Someplace else.

1041
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,649
- Maybe he went upstairs.

1042
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,942
- Do you think so?

1043
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,828
- Well, let's look.

1044
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:15,538
- All right.

1045
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,198
(thunder booming)

1046
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,408
- What is it?

1047
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,879
- This place is kinda spooky, ain't it?

1048
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,423
- Don't be silly, come on.

1049
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,041
(gasping)
What's the matter?

1050
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,043
- Feels just like the scene I played

1051
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,420
in The Case of the Haunted House.

1052
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,006
I had a great part in that
one though. Five screams!

1053
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,142
- Oh, come on!

1054
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,930
Say, about that scream of yours.

1055
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,056
How is it you didn't even peep

1056
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,974
when you saw the flower on the floor?

1057
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,059
- I don't know.

1058
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,310
I guess I got really scared.

1059
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,739
And when I get really scared, I--

1060
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,909
(gasping)

1061
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,401
- Hey, that's funny.

1062
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,372
You mean you can't even.

1063
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,042
(screaming)

1064
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,746
- Miss Lind, what happened?
- What did you see?

1065
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,580
- We were going up the stairs

1066
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,790
and we saw someone looking at us.

1067
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,041
- It's a fiend with fangs.

1068
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,209
- Oh, oh!

1069
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,710
- [Chuck] All right, all
right, all right, come here!

1070
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,586
- Chuck, don't hold me!

1071
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,879
Get your hands off me, get!
- All right.

1072
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,673
- I'm gonna get something
straight right now.

1073
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:17,507
- What happened?
- Did you see

1074
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,008
the puss she made?
(screaming)

1075
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,551
- All right, all right.
- Come on, come on.

1076
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,719
- All right, come on, come on, come on.

1077
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,605
- Come on, come on, fellas, come on!

1078
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,652
(dramatic music)

1079
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:35,817
- Who's up there?

1080
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,568
(hooting)

1081
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,455
- [Ferdinand] You, you, you coward!

1082
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,041
- [Dr. Jackson] Come on down.

1083
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,412
It was only an owl.

1084
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,621
- But with fangs!
- Mm hm.

1085
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,747
- There she starts again.
- Quiet.

1086
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,083
- What were you girls
doing upstairs anyway?

1087
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,584
- Oh, we went up to look for Mr. Smith

1088
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,794
and a place to sleep.

1089
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,838
- Oh sleep, that's what I could use.

1090
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,599
A nice warm bed to hide under.

1091
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,009
- Well Smith is not in the cellar.

1092
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,510
Maybe it's best we look upstairs.

1093
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,678
- Let's do that, yeah.

1094
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,981
- After you, girls.

1095
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,066
Wait for me.

1096
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,394
- [Chuck] come on, Ferdie.

1097
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,812
Ferdie, come on!

1098
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:13,855
- I can't go another step.

1099
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,731
- You're going upstairs.

1100
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,107
- I don't wanna go a step further.

1101
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,442
- Come on.
- Chuck, now leave me alone.

1102
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,443
- Now you listen to me.
- Look.

1103
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,277
- I don't wanna have
trouble, you understand?

1104
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,528
- I don't wanna go upstairs.
- You're going upstairs.

1105
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,155
- I'm not gonna go up stairs.
- You're going upstairs!

1106
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,114
- I don't wanna go upstairs.

1107
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,074
Now please, Chuck, don't take me upstairs.

1108
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,784
You go ahead, I'll stay
here. I'll be a lookout.

1109
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,661
- [Chuck] A lookout for what?
- For myself!

1110
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,871
- All right, give me the candles.

1111
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:30,872
I'll go upstairs.

1112
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:31,998
- Well as long as you leave me something.

1113
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,750
- [Chuck] Scared to
death, just a fraidy cat,

1114
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,625
that's all you are.

1115
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,668
- I'm not scared, Chuck.

1116
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,890
(light dramatic music)

1117
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,470
How do you do?

1118
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,314
Are you the hatcheck girl?

1119
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,270
(suspenseful music)

1120
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,229
Hey Chuck, downstairs.

1121
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,064
My hat, my hat!
- Yeah?

1122
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,357
All right, all right,
all right, keep quiet.

1123
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,243
Be careful, Doc.

1124
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,162
Be careful.

1125
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,579
Say, not bad!

1126
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,791
- No.
- All the comforts of home.

1127
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,209
- There's no bed coverings.

1128
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,376
- [Dr. Jackson] Here are some blankets.

1129
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,669
- [Camille] If you wanna
be a handyboy, Ferdie,

1130
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,962
come on over and help me.

1131
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,799
- [Chuck] Yes, help us make up this bed.

1132
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,425
(chuckling)

1133
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,637
- I feel like a bride
on the maid's day off.

1134
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:28,846
What small sheets!

1135
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,389
- Oh no, that goes at the head.

1136
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,651
- Oh, a nightcap.

1137
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,686
That's cute.
- No, not there!

1138
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,562
Give her a hand.

1139
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,449
- Okay.
- Grab the other end, Ferdie.

1140
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,820
And sit, now slip it under the mattress.

1141
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,622
- Okay.

1142
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,366
- What are you doing?

1143
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,086
What's the matter with you?

1144
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,205
- How?
- Now, leave it there

1145
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,217
and slip it under the mattress!

1146
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,262
Oh, dear.

1147
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,049
- What are you doing?

1148
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,092
Up here!

1149
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:09,428
- Why don't you make up your mind?

1150
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,429
Where do you want it?

1151
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,266
On top on the mattress
or under the mattress?

1152
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,017
One or the other!

1153
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,769
I'm getting tired.

1154
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,437
(thudding)
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!

1155
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,232
- [Camille] Well looks like
we're gonna sleep together.

1156
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,984
(whistling)

1157
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,193
Huh, Norma?
- Sure.

1158
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,361
- I'll find a room for Ferdie.

1159
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,988
I'll be back and help you fix the beds.

1160
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,406
- I'll try the room across the hall.

1161
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,616
- Ferdie, put that lamp on the highboy.

1162
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,951
- [Dr. Jackson] Good night.

1163
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:32,785
- [Camille] Good night.

1164
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,786
- What'd you say, Chuck?

1165
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:34,662
- Highboy!

1166
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,496
- Hi, Chuck.

1167
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,998
- No, no, put it up there.

1168
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,499
- Oh, that's a highboy?
- Yes.

1169
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,584
- How do you know if that's a boy or girl?

1170
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,127
- Oh, put it there and keep quiet.

1171
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,128
- Okay.
- Good night, girls.

1172
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:45,099
(suspenseful music)

1173
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,054
Oh, boy, ain't this something?

1174
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:52,889
- You like it, huh?

1175
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,473
- Mm hm!
- What are those?

1176
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,735
(door slamming)
Oh, jeez!

1177
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,895
- Will you stop following me!

1178
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,313
Hey, look.
- Huh?

1179
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,115
- Look.

1180
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:06,152
M.M., I'll bet this is the room
that Moose Matson slept in.

1181
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,830
- M.M., that's, what's this thing?

1182
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,282
- Oh that? You pull that
when you want your breakfast.

1183
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,701
- If I want my breakfast,
I pull this thing?

1184
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,535
- [Chuck] That's all.

1185
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,047
- Okay, ham and eggs.

1186
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,707
- Uh oh.

1187
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,541
- What did I do?

1188
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,084
- Uh oh.
- Chuck?

1189
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,669
- [Chuck] What?

1190
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,588
- Is my feet nailed to the floor?

1191
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,756
- [Chuck] No!

1192
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,809
- Then I must be paralyzed.

1193
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,760
Shall I look?

1194
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,063
- Go ahead.
- Hm?

1195
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,557
Uh oh.
- Oh, it's just a door.

1196
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,559
Open it up and see what's inside.

1197
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,646
- Who's gonna open up what
door to see if what's inside?

1198
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:42,772
What do you think I am?

1199
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,325
- I think you're scared.

1200
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,238
- I think I am too.

1201
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,072
- What?

1202
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,907
Of a perfectly ordinary door?

1203
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,701
- Yeah, well I know what happens
in those mystery pictures.

1204
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,329
A guy walks over to a
perfectly ordinary door.

1205
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,956
He opens it up and zowie!

1206
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,251
Out falls a body, right on its kisser.

1207
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,961
- You think there's a body in there?

1208
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,673
- I ain't sayin' there is and
I ain't sayin' there ain't.

1209
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,425
All I say is let's get outta here.

1210
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,261
- All right, wait a
minute, wait a minute now.

1211
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,095
I'll open the door.

1212
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,147
- You go ahead.
- Oh.

1213
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,860
There you are, empty.

1214
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,730
(suspenseful music)

1215
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,566
- Oh I, I should be ashamed of myself.

1216
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,787
I'm gettin' to be a big sissy.

1217
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,658
(body thudding)

1218
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,034
Oh, Charlie.
(dramatic music)

1219
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,703
(thudding)
- What happened?

1220
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,839
What happened?

1221
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,540
Charlie Smith!

1222
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,500
(stuttering) Come here, Ferdie.

1223
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,793
- Hey, Chuck.
- Ferdie.

1224
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,752
Come on pull yourself together, Ferdie.

1225
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,878
- Hey Chuck.
- It's all right.

1226
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,713
- What happened, what happened?

1227
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:49,547
- It's all right.

1228
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,882
- I was standing over
there and a guy, see?

1229
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,676
- All right, all right, come on, Ferdie.

1230
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,635
Oh, Doc?

1231
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,438
Doc, help!

1232
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,139
Doc, Doc!

1233
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,473
- What's happened?
- What is it?

1234
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,558
- It's murder.

1235
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,726
- What?

1236
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,727
It's murder.

1237
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,769
- Murder?

1238
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,104
Ferdie?

1239
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,605
(gasping)

1240
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,441
(thudding)
- Oh, Camille.

1241
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,317
- Come on, come on.

1242
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,609
Snap out of it, snap out of it.

1243
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,694
- [Ferdinand] What
happened, what happened.

1244
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:12,778
- A murder.

1245
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,780
- [Ferdinand] Camille, oh!

1246
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,740
(thudding)

1247
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,949
- No, no, he's all right.

1248
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,117
It's in there.
- Smith?

1249
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:18,919
- Yes.

1250
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,049
(suspenseful music)

1251
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,315
- Well?

1252
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,308
- He's been strangled.

1253
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,142
- Is that serious?

1254
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,977
- The man is dead.

1255
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,020
- Oh, that's serious.

1256
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,355
- Quiet!

1257
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,982
(knocking)

1258
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:50,785
Who's there?

1259
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,248
Who is it?

1260
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:01,712
Who's there?

1261
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,592
(knocking)

1262
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,716
Who is it?

1263
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,176
- [Policeman] Open this door!

1264
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,010
- [Chuck] Who are you?

1265
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,146
- [Policeman] The police!

1266
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,983
- We're very glad to see you, officers.

1267
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,144
- What's going on around here?

1268
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,396
Trespassers, huh?

1269
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,855
- Oh no, we own the place.

1270
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,899
- Yes, we inherited this
place from Moose Matson.

1271
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,275
- You relatives of his?

1272
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,069
- We were very close to him
at the time of his surmise.

1273
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,571
- Officers, we can go into
this social detail later.

1274
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,073
At the moment, there
happens to be the body

1275
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,574
of a murdered man in this house.

1276
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,827
- And not only that, he's
tied with a lot of string

1277
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,745
and had something across his mouth.

1278
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,705
- He had a gag in his mouth.

1279
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,624
- If he did, he never
had a chance to tell it.

1280
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,500
- This way, officers.

1281
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,709
- Come on, I'll show you.

1282
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,211
It's upstairs, I saw it myself.

1283
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,546
(mumbling)

1284
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,547
(humming)

1285
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:55,548
It ain't me.

1286
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:56,549
I'm innocent.

1287
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,800
I didn't have nothin' to do with it.

1288
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,602
- Let's go!

1289
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,982
(dramatic music)

1290
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,350
- Oh, hello.

1291
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,446
Say, could you tell me
what happened to my hat?

1292
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,783
(Ferdie groaning)

1293
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,281
- That's very strange, it was here.

1294
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,032
- Don't ever leave me alone.

1295
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,075
- Shh, quiet.

1296
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,118
- Hey, Chuck,
- What?

1297
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,453
- Downstairs, the hat.

1298
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,704
- Never mind that.

1299
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,580
It's gone.

1300
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:28,382
- It's gone?

1301
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,301
Oh.

1302
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,460
I got it.

1303
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,679
Hey, watch.

1304
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,756
(door slamming)

1305
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,591
What do you know?

1306
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,301
- Why the body was
right here on the floor.

1307
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,260
- He's disappeared.

1308
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,928
He was in the cellar just
before he disappeared.

1309
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:43,762
I'll show you.

1310
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,805
- Wait a minute, we know our way around.

1311
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,432
Now if you folks take our advice,

1312
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,392
you'll get out now right now.

1313
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,195
Let's go.

1314
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,730
- Now we mustn't let this upset us.

1315
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,732
The best thing to do is go back to bed.

1316
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,108
- Are you going back to bed?

1317
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,903
- Oh yes indeed, as soon as
I have my glass of warm milk.

1318
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,112
May I bring you some?

1319
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:00,946
- No, thank you.
- No thanks.

1320
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,657
- Oh, it's a fine sleep inducer.

1321
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,127
Well, pleasant dreams.

1322
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,786
- Come on, Camille, the doctor's right.

1323
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,079
We better get some sleep.

1324
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,466
- 0h.
- Good night, boys.

1325
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,670
- Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!
- What's the matter?

1326
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,505
What's the matter?
- 0h, Chuck!

1327
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:18,339
- What's the matter?

1328
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,591
- What did I tell you
before about going away

1329
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,967
and leaving me by myself?

1330
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,302
- Oh, I was right here.

1331
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,595
- No, you wasn't, you was over there.

1332
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:25,429
- Oh, behave, come on.

1333
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,263
- Chuck.
- What?

1334
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,348
- Do we have to sleep in this room?

1335
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,766
- Well, you're not afraid, are you?

1336
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,600
- No.
- Well?

1337
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,018
- But if you see a pair
of pants flying through

1338
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,311
the air, don't grab 'em.

1339
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:33,354
- Why?

1340
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,855
- I'll be in 'em!
- All right, come on.

1341
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,023
Come on, maybe we'll find another room

1342
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,993
down the hallway.
- Okay.

1343
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:48,045
(creaking)
(dramatic music)

1344
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:52,967
- Oh, well!

1345
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,544
A private bath.

1346
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,254
- I'm not gonna take a
bath in this spooky joint.

1347
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,266
Nobody's gonna catch me with my coat off.

1348
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,720
- Say, this is fine.

1349
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,305
NOW we can have separate rooms.

1350
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,682
- You mean I gotta sleep
here all by myself?

1351
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:10,683
- Well certainly.

1352
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,226
- Hey, Chuck.
- What?

1353
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,311
- I'd be awful silly if I
were scared, wouldn't I?

1354
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,230
- Why naturally.

1355
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,107
- Boy am I silly!

1356
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,734
- Well, good night, sleep tight.

1357
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,329
- Chuck, if you hear me, come in.

1358
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,958
Sleep all by myself.

1359
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,555
(light dramatic music)

1360
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,536
Must be neat.

1361
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:14,923
(suspenseful music)
(clanking)

1362
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,440
(water dripping)

1363
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,284
(dramatic music)

1364
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,557
Chuck, Chuck!

1365
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,351
Am I dreaming or am I awake?

1366
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,602
- [Chuck] Well, you're awake, of course.

1367
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,813
- Couldn't I be dreaming
but you're saying I'm awake?

1368
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:21,689
- [Chuck] What's the matter with you?

1369
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,731
- Couldn't I?
- No.

1370
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,691
- No?
- What's wrong?

1371
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:25,109
- Then I'm dreaming.
- Oh, come on.

1372
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,360
- My whole room changed
into a gambling joint.

1373
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,986
- Oh, that's ridiculous now--
- Whole room.

1374
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,196
Chuckaluck.
- No.

1375
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,030
- Slot machines.
- Yes, yes, all right.

1376
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,376
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Let me see this.

1377
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,579
Well?

1378
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,248
- Chuck, there was a roulette table there.

1379
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,582
If I'm dreaming it, then I dreamt it.

1380
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,376
But if I'm awake, I saw it.

1381
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,253
- Oh, you're letting your
imagination run away with you.

1382
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:45,629
- Chuck, I can't imagine things like this.

1383
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,839
I'm not that clever.

1384
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,590
- All right, then there
is roulette tables!

1385
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,426
All over the place, room
is full of roulette tables.

1386
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,260
I like roulette tables.

1387
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,302
I like to sleep on 'em.

1388
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,222
Nice, soft roulette table--
- No, no, no, no.

1389
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,057
That was a dice board.

1390
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:57,891
- All right, now look.

1391
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:58,726
I wanna get some sleep.

1392
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,477
Here, you go in my room and sleep.

1393
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,311
I'll sleep in here.

1394
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,271
Is that all right?
- Okay.

1395
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,866
- All right, now go ahead. Be a nice boy.

1396
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,112
(clanking)

1397
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,833
(dramatic music)

1398
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,160
Now what's wrong?

1399
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,838
- I forgot the rest of my clothes.

1400
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,247
Sleep tight.

1401
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,249
(whistling)

1402
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,792
- Go to sleep!

1403
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,430
(door slamming)

1404
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,099
- Oh, oh, oh!

1405
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:31,800
(screaming)

1406
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,437
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!

1407
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,929
Chuck!

1408
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:36,764
Chuck!
- Just a minute.

1409
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,057
- It happened in your
room now, the whole thing.

1410
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:39,975
- Huh, what are you talking about?

1411
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,393
- Everything, dice,
Chuckaluck, roulette tables.

1412
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,561
- All right, all right, all right.

1413
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,062
- They got a slot machine in there.

1414
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,355
You put in a quarter,
and you pull like this.

1415
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,231
- Yeah.
- And you hit a jackpot.

1416
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,524
- Just wait a minute!

1417
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,077
(muffled screaming)
Wait a minute!

1418
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,738
Stop working yourself up
into one of your frenzies!

1419
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:53,572
- What frenzies?

1420
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,200
I ain't making frienzies
with nobody in here.

1421
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,701
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Chuck, let's get outta here.

1422
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,912
- Come on, come on, come on.
- No don't take me back Chuck.

1423
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:00,829
Chuck, don't take me back--
- Come on, come on.

1424
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,706
- In there, Chuck, no Chuck, Chuck don't,

1425
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,458
Chuck don't, don't, I
don't wanna see the room.

1426
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,084
Chuck, I'm telling you, the
whole room, the whole room.

1427
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,419
There was a roulette table--

1428
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,921
- What?

1429
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,589
Now what's wrong?

1430
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,716
What's wrong in here?
- It did it again, that's all.

1431
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,593
- It did what, nothing has happened!

1432
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:15,427
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1433
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,012
- Will you do me a favor
and stop this nonsense,

1434
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,138
and get in bed?

1435
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:18,972
Now get in bed then.

1436
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:19,858
Go on and stay there.

1437
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:22,976
(light dramatic music)

1438
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,114
(frantically panting)

1439
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,237
- I know the room changed.

1440
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,581
A lot of things around here.

1441
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:38,710
Oh, oh, oh.

1442
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,839
Oh, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!

1443
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,167
Oh yeah, see that?

1444
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:47,970
The whole.

1445
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,422
Did you ever see anything like that?

1446
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,757
- All right, come on.

1447
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,967
I'll get you another room.

1448
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,261
- I'm gonna get my own room.

1449
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:00,180
(groaning)

1450
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,151
(suspenseful music)

1451
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,830
(thunder booming)

1452
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,996
- You seem very busy, Doctor.
- Huh?

1453
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,455
- Don't tell me you make your own milk.

1454
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,258
- Huh?

1455
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,668
- What are you doing?

1456
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,305
- [Dr. Jackson] Huh?

1457
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,924
- I suppose if I was to tell
you the house was on fire,

1458
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:36,842
you'd say, huh?

1459
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,386
- Hand me that blue bottle, please.

1460
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,512
What's on fire?

1461
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,857
- Nothing, not a thing.

1462
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,808
You're the concentratingest
man I ever met.

1463
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,476
- Well, I'm analyzing the water.

1464
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,479
- Here we are surrounded
by murder and mystery

1465
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,607
and all you do is calmly
analyze the water!

1466
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,358
- Are you worried?

1467
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,318
- Oh, I don't know.

1468
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,194
- You don't strike me as the nervous type.

1469
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:56,997
- Don't I?

1470
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,043
- I'll bet you have
perfect 20l20 vision too.

1471
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,493
- [Norma] Thanks.

1472
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,287
- Well, don't you?

1473
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,465
- Oh, is it important?

1474
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,667
Actually, would you prefer
a girl with healthy eyes,

1475
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,337
to a girl with pretty eyes
who's as blind as a bat?

1476
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,630
Look at you.

1477
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,851
Without those portholes, you
probably can't see a thing.

1478
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,347
- I noted you had beautiful
eyes the first time I saw you,

1479
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,808
but I didn't get around
to mentioning it then.

1480
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,435
- Mention it now.

1481
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:33,367
- Well, they're soft and
limpid, like two pools of water.

1482
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,078
Water?

1483
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,622
Oh, my glasses, please.

1484
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:41,907
- I suppose your silly experiment

1485
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,033
couldn't wait a while could it?

1486
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,493
- [Dr. Jackson] Huh?

1487
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,254
- Oh, huh yourself!

1488
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,050
- No, in fact, you're the
most beautiful girl I ever.

1489
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,135
Huh?

1490
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:56,306
(light dramatic music)

1491
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,475
(knocking)

1492
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,277
- Come in.

1493
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,645
(knocking)

1494
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,230
Come in!

1495
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,565
Who is it?

1496
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,900
Come in.

1497
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:17,703
Who is it?

1498
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,029
Who is it?

1499
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:21,832
Yes?

1500
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,041
Locked.

1501
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,459
Chuck, Chuck!

1502
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,335
Hey, Chuck.

1503
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,503
Oh, Chuck.

1504
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,838
Hey Chuck.

1505
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:38,672
Chuck.

1506
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:39,506
- What are you doing?

1507
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,590
- Chuck, listen.
- What happened?

1508
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,550
- Did you knock on my door just now?

1509
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,384
- No.
- You didn't?

1510
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,218
- No.
- Did you lock it?

1511
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,052
- Certainly not.

1512
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:44,886
- Well, it's locked.

1513
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:45,721
- It's locked?

1514
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:46,555
- I'm scared to death.

1515
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:47,431
- It's locked?
' YEP, yep, YEP: YEP: YeP-

1516
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,151
- Come on, come on.

1517
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,446
No, no, no, come on, come on.

1518
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:55,439
- I'm telling you, Chuck,
the door is locked?

1519
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,232
- Is this another one of your brainstorms?

1520
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,952
- No, 90 ahead, you try to open it.

1521
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,081
See?

1522
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,617
Now I know that door was locked.

1523
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,046
- Aw, nonsense!

1524
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,294
What is this all about?

1525
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,046
Get a load of this mess!

1526
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:19,880
(slapping)

1527
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,922
What's wrong with you?

1528
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,507
What's come over you all of a sudden?

1529
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,341
- I tried--
- Be quiet.

1530
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:24,509
Don't give me any arguments.

1531
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,303
Look at this room, look around here.

1532
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,137
- You don't--
- Where's that?

1533
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,765
Never mind that, a fine time to play.

1534
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,349
What is this all about?

1535
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,643
You wouldn't do this at home,
would you? Certainly not.

1536
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,979
And this place is just as
much mine as it is yours.

1537
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,147
- You don't think--
- Don't ever do a thing

1538
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,190
like this again.

1539
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,483
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

1540
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,567
Now clean it up!

1541
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,779
Get right with it.
- Hey, Chuck?

1542
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:44,905
(slapping)
- Don't ever

1543
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,208
pull a knife on me!

1544
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,867
(thunder booming)

1545
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,838
(suspenseful music)

1546
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,760
- Norma.
- Huh?

1547
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,211
- Are you asleep?

1548
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,670
- No.

1549
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,505
- Neither am I.

1550
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,632
Didn't that warm milk make you sleepy?

1551
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,300
- Didn't have any.

1552
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,135
- 0h, then maybe we should, huh?

1553
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,720
- Oh, I don't want any.

1554
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,523
You have some.

1555
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,767
- [Camille] The doctor's
still down there, isn't he?

1556
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,769
- His body is.

1557
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:16,978
- Body?

1558
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,491
- Yeah, his mind is miles away!

1559
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,484
- Norma, don't do that.

1560
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:23,735
Don't play games with me, honey.

1561
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,831
I don't feel so well, you know.

1562
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,243
(door slamming)

1563
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,045
Oh!

1564
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:34,881
Excuse me.

1565
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:54,391
(light dramatic music)

1566
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,362
(suspenseful music)

1567
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,122
(stairs creaking)

1568
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,438
(stomping)

1569
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,371
(screaming)

1570
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,629
(door slamming)

1571
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,542
- What was that?

1572
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,752
- What happened?
- Oh, what is it?

1573
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,962
- What's wrong? What a
minute, now don't get excited.

1574
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:06,963
What are you screaming about?

1575
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,006
What happened?

1576
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:08,882
- A ghost.
- A ghost?

1577
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,217
- A ghost!
- A ghost?

1578
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,176
- With fangs.

1579
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:12,552
- What, again?

1580
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,762
- Hello, Chuck.

1581
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,472
Did you come back to apologize to me?

1582
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,057
Well if you did, you don't have to.

1583
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,109
I forgive you.

1584
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,989
(suspenseful music)

1585
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,653
Hey, hey, hey!

1586
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:30,487
Hey, hey!

1587
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,197
He's in my room, in my bed.

1588
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,949
Pulling the covers over his head!

1589
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,200
(clapping)
Come on, come on.

1590
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,368
- [Chuck] Hey!

1591
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,619
- [Camille] Wait, wait.

1592
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:38,620
- [Chuck] What's the matter?

1593
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,623
- I'm afraid to have you
go up there without me.

1594
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,083
- [Chuck] Come on, come on, come on!

1595
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:43,885
Hurry up.

1596
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,723
- There's your ghost.

1597
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,476
- Just as I thought!

1598
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,929
- This couldn't by any
chance he a joke, could it?

1599
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,847
- Everything seems to
happen to you around here.

1600
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,307
- Everything except
what happened to Smitty.

1601
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,851
Camille, I was laying on the bed and,

1602
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,853
oh, excuse me.

1603
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,481
- Well, whoever's doing this
certainly isn't fooling.

1604
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,400
They're obviously trying
to get us out of the house.

1605
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,859
- Where are those detectives anyway?

1606
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,820
If that scream didn't bring them out--

1607
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,164
- Maybe they're, (croaking).

1608
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,615
- [Chuck] Well, let's find out.

1609
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,325
- You girls get ready to leave.

1610
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,160
You and I will search the
house, find the detectives,

1611
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,453
and make them take us town.

1612
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,496
Come on, Chuck

1613
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,998
- [Norma] Oh, come on, Camille.

1614
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,249
Come on!

1615
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,458
- Doctor, I think we better split up.

1616
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,043
- Too bad I can't finish
this experiment though,

1617
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,596
I'm really onto something here.

1618
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,339
- Chuck, let's go back to the gas station.

1619
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,300
- Now don't get excited, sit down here.

1620
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,759
Now the doctor and I are going to search

1621
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,802
the cellar and the grounds.

1622
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,721
I want you to sit here
and wait for the girls.

1623
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:38,596
- All alone?

1624
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,514
- Yes, sit down.

1625
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,016
Now here's a road map.

1626
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,225
Find the easiest way out of here.

1627
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,143
- That's a good idea.

1628
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,312
- Hey Chuck, suppose the ghost comes back?

1629
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:46,938
- Oh, the ghost is only a rumor.

1630
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,940
- I don't care if he's the
landlord. Suppose he comes back.

1631
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,650
- Now sit down, don't get excited.

1632
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,444
- Don't get excited.
- If you want me, just holler

1633
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,070
Oh, Chuck and I'll come right in.

1634
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,071
- Okay.

1635
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,531
0h, Chuck!
- Yeah, what is it?

1636
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,283
- Come on, come on, what kept you?

1637
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,909
- Why I came in just like that!

1638
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,953
- If you can get in here in
between that, you get here.

1639
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,330
- Well sit down now, take it easy.

1640
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,164
Read that map.

1641
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,498
- Don't forget when I call,
oh, Chuck, get in here.

1642
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,417
- [Chuck] All right.

1643
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:10,638
(light dramatic music)

1644
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,982
- Now I'm all alone.

1645
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,142
(suspenseful music)

1646
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:24,944
Oh, Chuck.

1647
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,075
Oh, Chuck?

1648
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,944
Oh, Chuck?

1649
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,237
Oh, Chuck!

1650
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,280
Oh, Chuck!

1651
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,365
Chuck, get in here!

1652
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,199
Oh, Chuck!
- I'm here.

1653
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,033
- 0h, Chuck!
- I'm here.

1654
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,410
- 0h, Chuck, oh, Chuck!
- I'm here, here, here here.

1655
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,244
Snap out of it.
- Oh, Chuck.

1656
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,538
- I'm here.
- Where have you been?

1657
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,916
I called 42 oh, Chucks
and you didn't come in.

1658
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,834
- I came in as soon as
you hollered oh, Chuck.

1659
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,420
- From now on, don't wait
for me to say oh, Chuck.

1660
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,172
Get in here on the oh.

1661
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,216
- All right, now you're all--

1662
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,217
- Are you boys ready to leave?

1663
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,885
- I was ready to leave when he put

1664
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,553
the key in the front door to come in.

1665
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,596
- Camille, do me a favor.

1666
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,057
Will you please sit down
and keep Ferdie company.

1667
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,266
He's all excited.

1668
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,935
Sit down here and help him read this map.

1669
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,019
Now, take it easy.

1670
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,898
- Thanks, Camille for keeping me company.

1671
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,526
I do so want not to be alone.

1672
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,819
You take this map and see

1673
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,705
if you can find a road out of here.

1674
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:26,047
Now, if we take Route 72, we
could cut through the forest,

1675
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,635
and then we could take a
back road and I suppose we.

1676
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,646
(gasping)

1677
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,275
(stuttering)

1678
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,044
(pounding on table)

1679
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,134
Oh, Chuck?

1680
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,043
Oh, Chuck!

1681
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:14,919
- Yeah, yes, yes, yes.

1682
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,421
- Oh, Chuck!
- Yeah, wait a minute now.

1683
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,755
Just a minute, here.

1684
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,008
All right, I'm leaving, now
don't get excited, please.

1685
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,634
- It went a zip a zip.

1686
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,969
- Wait a minute, just a minute.

1687
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,888
You mean that candle moved?

1688
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,055
Just a minute.

1689
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,640
Camille, did you see that candle move?

1690
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,766
- No!

1691
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,642
- Where were you looking?

1692
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,560
- At the map.

1693
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:31,644
- Never mind the map.

1694
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,854
Keep your eye on that candle.

1695
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,939
- Oh, come now, that's ridiculous.

1696
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,399
That candle can't move.

1697
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,442
- No?
- Now look, you want me

1698
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:39,152
to find the detectives, don't you?

1699
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:39,986
Huh?

1700
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,029
We wanna get out of here.

1701
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,739
Now find a road outta
here, please, I'm busy--

1702
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,240
- I'll find a road out of here.

1703
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,075
- All right, now, don't call
me unless you need me, please.

1704
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,745
- I'll find a road if I have to make one.

1705
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:52,957
Camille, are you sure you
didn't see that candle move?

1706
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,167
(Camille humming)

1707
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:57,764
I know that went zip, zip in front of me.

1708
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,340
No, huh?

1709
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,799
(Camille humming)

1710
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,801
Now I know I am alone.

1711
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,730
Now keep your eye on that candle.

1712
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:12,987
Now, if we take Route number
16 right out the front door,

1713
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,522
that's the route that's out there,

1714
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,358
we could get in somebody's car passing by

1715
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,410
and sort of (buzzing).

1716
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,669
(gasping)

1717
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,808
(stuttering)

1718
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,973
Oh, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

1719
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:52,350
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!

1720
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,184
- Yes, yes?
- Chuck, Chuck!

1721
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,644
- No, no.
- I said wait a minute,

1722
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:55,937
wait a minute.
- No, (stammering).

1723
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,855
- Wait a minute, what's going on here?

1724
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:58,690
Now wait a minute, just a minute.

1725
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,816
Now calm down for a minute.

1726
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:00,817
Wait a min, just a minute.
- No!

1727
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:01,734
- Sorry, all right, all right, all right.

1728
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,652
- No!
- Wait a minute.

1729
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,529
Yes, I understand, just a minute.

1730
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:05,780
Hold still a minute.

1731
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,699
Just a minute, take it easy.

1732
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,576
You mean that candle moved?

1733
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,995
Wait a minute, Camille, did
you see that candle move?

1734
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,496
- No!

1735
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,081
- Where were you looking?

1736
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:15,915
- There.

1737
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,250
- What are you lookin' over there for?

1738
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,627
- You told me to look at that candle.

1739
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,671
- Don't believe me, I'm a liar.

1740
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,590
- Now, now, now, now, now, wait a minute.

1741
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,549
What is this all about?

1742
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,301
This is all nonsense.

1743
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:27,885
- It's very peculiar nonsense.

1744
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,804
- 0h there's nothing peculiar about it.

1745
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,264
Now take it easy, sit down there.

1746
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,058
I left the doctor all alone out there.

1747
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,603
Now take it easy, don't get
excited about this thing.

1748
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,396
Everything's all right,
you have company here.

1749
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,606
You're not alone.

1750
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:40,440
- No, not much.

1751
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,951
- All right, now just calm down.

1752
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,990
- Look, from now on keep
one eye on that candle,

1753
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,713
another eye on that one and
with the other eye, watch me.

1754
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:59,959
(thunder booming)
(suspenseful music)

1755
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,461
(wind whistling)

1756
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:02,462
What was that?

1757
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,464
- Those candles went out.

1758
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,590
- Do you feel a draft?

1759
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,133
- No.

1760
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,969
- If these candles move, you will.

1761
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,805
I'll get out of here so fast the suction

1762
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,233
will carry you along with me.

1763
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:16,559
I can't even read the map

1764
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,363
(slapping)
any, any, anymore.

1765
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:21,648
This is no laughing matter.

1766
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:22,607
Now, I'm scared.

1767
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,442
Now keep your hands to yourself.

1768
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:25,662
Don't slap me.

1769
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,403
- I didn't slap you.

1770
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,665
- Now if we can...

1771
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,037
You didn't slap me?

1772
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:36,839
- No.

1773
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,542
- Now, if we can--
(slapping)

1774
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,345
- Ferdie.

1775
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:45,171
Don't do that, Ferdie.

1776
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,507
I don't like that. You're a
nice little boy and I don't like

1777
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,716
to see you do those things.

1778
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,051
So cut it out.

1779
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,010
- What did I do?

1780
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,387
- You know what you did
and don't do it again.

1781
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,398
You slapped me.

1782
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,057
- Now.

1783
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,486
- And you're supposed to be a boy scout.

1784
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,437
- I didn't slap you, Camille.

1785
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,647
- Yes you did, Ferdie!

1786
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,691
- Didn't you slap me in the face?

1787
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,359
(Camille humming)
- Did you slap me?

1788
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,193
(Fernie humming)

1789
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,403
- [Both] Uh oh!

1790
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,614
(suspenseful music)

1791
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,699
- Camille, oh, Chuck.

1792
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,660
(Camille screaming)
Oh, Chuck, oh, Chuck!

1793
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,494
I've got you, boy.

1794
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,538
I've got you, you old ghost!

1795
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:21,300
I'm gonna lift up your sheet
and see who you really are.

1796
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,794
- Camille, what happened?
- What's wrong?

1797
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:25,878
- What?
(slapping)

1798
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:26,713
- Here, here.
- Wait a minute,

1799
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,257
what going on here?
- That's what I want to know!

1800
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,425
What's going on here?

1801
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:31,634
- And that's what I wanna know!

1802
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:32,969
- Now.

1803
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,470
- I almost had a ghost and
Camille got in the way.

1804
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,607
- Oh, I better see if Norma's all right.

1805
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,058
I wish I knew why someone is so anxious

1806
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,435
to keep people away from this tavern.

1807
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:41,978
- Me too.

1808
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,479
- Must be Moose's bankroll.

1809
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,313
- [Camille] What bankroll?

1810
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,441
- Well, Moose is supposed
to have buried his bankroll.

1811
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,316
- [Camille] Around this tavern?

1812
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,484
- Well, nobody knows.

1813
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,069
The only thing they
ever heard Moose say was

1814
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,946
that he kept his money in his head.

1815
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,916
- Hey, Chuck, you mean in that thing?

1816
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,200
- What thing?

1817
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,785
- That horse with a hat rack on its head.

1818
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:58,953
- No, no, you don't understand.

1819
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,621
When I say, Moose kept
the money in his head,

1820
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,540
that's just a figure of speech.

1821
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,458
- 0h, a figure of speech!

1822
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,293
- [Chuck] You know what
a figure of speech is?

1823
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:06,627
- Oh yeah, everybody knows that.

1824
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:07,503
- [Chuck] What is it?

1825
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,380
- A figure of speech is
just like if I said to you

1826
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,257
water went under the bridge.

1827
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,226
- Under what bridge?

1828
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,553
- How do I know what bridge.

1829
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,054
- Then how do you know
there's any water under it?

1830
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,389
- There's gotta be water under the bridge

1831
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,975
so the boats can go up and down.

1832
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:21,809
- Up and down?

1833
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,686
Suppose they wanna go across?

1834
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,063
- I'm a sucker for arguing with this guy.

1835
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,774
- Why do you start these arguments?

1836
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,526
- You asked me if I knew
what a figure of speech was,

1837
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:32,862
and I said, just like as if I said,

1838
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,405
water went under the bridge.

1839
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,241
I shoulda said like gone with the wind.

1840
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,044
- What wind?

1841
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:41,996
- Am I gonna have trouble with you now?

1842
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,123
What do I know what wind?

1843
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,833
Any wind!

1844
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:46,876
- I didn't find the detectives

1845
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,836
but I think we better
get out of here anyway.

1846
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:49,670
Are you ready?

1847
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,339
- Yeah, in a moment.
- Hm.

1848
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,257
- I'm sorry if I kept you waiting.

1849
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,468
- Oh, that's quite all
right, that's quite.

1850
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,677
Say, you're angry at me.

1851
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,980
- No.
- Oh, but you are.

1852
01:11:58,940 --> 01:11:59,931
- That's ridiculous.

1853
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,390
- [Dr. Jackson] You're angry
at me because you like me.

1854
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,225
- [Norma] 0h, forbid.

1855
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,518
- But you do like me a bit.

1856
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,645
I mean, well at least don't you feel

1857
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:06,938
a little safer when I'm around?

1858
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,272
- Doctor, whenever I have to

1859
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,941
turn to you for protection, I'll--

1860
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:14,872
(dramatic music)
(screaming)

1861
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:22,078
- Darling, are you hurt?

1862
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:22,964
- No, dear.

1863
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,667
Dear, you called me darling.

1864
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,837
- Darling, you called me dear.

1865
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:31,796
- [Norma] Did I?

1866
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:33,130
- [Dr. Jackson] I guess we
shouldn't be standing here.

1867
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,643
We should be out trying to
find the detectives and.

1868
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:41,278
(knife thudding)
(dramatic music)

1869
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,724
- I've been talking to you all this time

1870
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,893
and still you haven't explained to me

1871
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,646
why you should even
say gone with the wind.

1872
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:52,191
- When I said gone with the
wind it was a figure of speech.

1873
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:55,236
Just like never the twain shall meet.

1874
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:56,038
- What twain?

1875
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,701
- The twain on twack twee.

1876
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,077
- Ah, what's the use of talking to you?

1877
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:06,831
- I'd like to know what
started this whole argument!

1878
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,917
- Why you said there was
money up in the moose's head.

1879
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,878
- Would it make you two any happier

1880
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,505
if I proved to you that
there's no money up there?

1881
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:15,965
- Go ahead.
- Give me a chair.

1882
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,133
- There you are, 90 ahead.

1883
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,394
- I'll prove it to you.

1884
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:21,554
Ooh!

1885
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:22,481
You got a big head.

1886
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,767
Now look, I'm gonna put
my hand in your mouth.

1887
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,895
Don't bite it!

1888
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,865
This one's going in, the one I eat with.

1889
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,706
I got a way with animals.

1890
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,534
Take it easy.

1891
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,494
Hope you ain't ticklish.

1892
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,715
Hey, Chuck, the moose's tongue is peeling.

1893
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,833
- Sure, peeling.

1894
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,084
There's all, there's all.

1895
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,170
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

1896
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,212
What is this?

1897
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,339
- I don't know.

1898
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,141
- Wait a minute.

1899
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,050
It's real!

1900
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,009
Come on, keep peeling it.

1901
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,385
- [Ferdinand] Let go
of my pants, would ya?

1902
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,511
- [Chuck] Atta boy, Ferdie!

1903
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,471
- Stop pulling my pants.

1904
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,264
- Come on, send it all down, come on.

1905
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,098
- Hey, Chuck.
- Come on.

1906
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,309
- Let go of my pants.
- Get it all out.

1907
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:09,685
- This guy's got some tongue in here.

1908
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,228
- Well get the tongue out.

1909
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,396
- Hey, Camille?

1910
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,522
- [Camille] Huh?

1911
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,359
- Does mooses have tonsils?

1912
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,611
- I hope that one's got
a big one, a green one.

1913
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,112
- He's got a pip.

1914
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,447
- Where is it?

1915
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,541
Look at that tonsil!

1916
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,868
- What a tonsil, what a tonsil.

1917
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:26,911
- [Chuck] Come on, keep it peeling.

1918
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,079
- Get my hand out!
- Come on.

1919
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,163
Never mind your hand, I'll buy you one.

1920
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,039
- Somebody, help!
- It ain't no time

1921
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,082
to think of your hand.
- Help!

1922
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:32,667
- Come on, Ferdie.
- Let it out.

1923
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,460
I'll never join your lodge!

1924
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,003
- Never mind your arm,
we'll buy you a new one.

1925
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,505
Nevermind.
- I think I'm gonna faint.

1926
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,307
Let go!

1927
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:40,142
Oh, you!

1928
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:43,970
Now.

1929
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,554
There, now I hope you two are satisfied

1930
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:46,847
that there's no money up
there in the moose's head.

1931
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:47,807
- Sure.
- Now go ahead

1932
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,684
and argue with me.
- No more arguments.

1933
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,028
Ferdie, I love you!

1934
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:52,738
- He loves me!

1935
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,773
- Thousands, millions.

1936
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,066
- Millions?
- Trillions!

1937
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:57,942
- Trillions?

1938
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,027
- Oh, I'd love to run through
that with my bare feet.

1939
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:00,861
- I don't get it.

1940
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,030
- Hey, Ferdie, look, look.

1941
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,240
- Look, Ferdie.
- What's that?

1942
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,825
- That's what you got
out of the moose's head.

1943
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:06,742
- Oh that.
- Yes.

1944
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,077
- See, I told you there was no money.

1945
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,328
- No, no, no, Ferdie.
- Money, money!

1946
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,162
- Now don't get excited.
(shrieking)

1947
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,163
I know how you feel.

1948
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,081
Look--
- Money!

1949
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,749
- What do you say?
- Money, money.

1950
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,418
- We've gotta find those detectives.

1951
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:16,460
What have you got there?

1952
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,461
- $10 bills.

1953
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:18,754
Thousands and thousands of $10 bills.

1954
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:19,755
- [Norma] But where on earth?

1955
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:20,881
- Hidden in the moose's head.

1956
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:22,466
- [Ferdinand] Yeah, and
you folks have no idea

1957
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:23,467
what we're gonna do with this money.

1958
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,552
- But I have.

1959
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,345
- Oh no, you haven't.
- You're gonna hand it over.

1960
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,472
- Oh.
- All right, stick 'em up!

1961
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,266
- It ain't yours.

1962
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,350
- I've got to give you credit.

1963
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,852
I've been hunting that dough for weeks.

1964
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,145
- Oh gee, finders is keepers.

1965
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:35,730
- Yeah, and I'm the keeper!

1966
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,398
- I didn't work for Moose
Matson for 15 years just

1967
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,108
to let someone else get the gravy.

1968
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,151
- We don't want the
gravy, you can have it.

1969
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,570
- Put that down!
- Will you stop it.

1970
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,612
- [Dr. Jackson] Look out, I've got him!

1971
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:44,447
- I've got him!
- You've got me.

1972
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:45,698
Get him.
- All right, hold him.

1973
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,949
I'll (banging), got him.

1974
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,451
- No, no.

1975
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:49,285
- Drag him out.

1976
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:50,578
- I'm always left with
these kinds of things.

1977
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:51,537
- Go ahead, drag 'em out.

1978
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,455
- Look what you did to the guy.

1979
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:53,456
- [Chuck] Throw him out.

1980
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:54,331
Anyplace.

1981
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,958
- Phew, that was a close one.

1982
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,209
- Oh wow, did you let him have it!

1983
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,587
Boom, boom.
- Boy, we are now

1984
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,047
sitting on top of the world.

1985
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,006
- That's a figure of speech.

1986
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,642
- Just like reach for the ceiling.

1987
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:06,635
I suppose we oughta thank you people

1988
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,637
for finding all this sugar for us.

1989
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:09,889
All right, hand it over.

1990
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:10,723
(Ferdie groaning)

1991
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,141
Come on, fatty!

1992
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:12,975
- He means you.

1993
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,978
- Ooh, fatty!

1994
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,940
I lost 43 pounds since
I've been in the place.

1995
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,609
(dramatic music)

1996
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:22,651
- 0h, run, Ferdie!

1997
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:23,527
Run, Ferdie!

1998
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:28,501
Go, Ferdie!
- Don't move.

1999
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:32,004
(gunshots banging)
- 0h, ooh.

2000
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,427
- Come out of there.

2001
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,304
Come out of there or I'll let you have it.

2002
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:53,192
(gunshots banging)

2003
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:55,903
- Charlie Smith.

2004
01:16:58,781 --> 01:16:59,782
- He come back again.

2005
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:02,576
- Look after that body.

2006
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,115
Now which way did he go?

2007
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,586
- Here I come, he's takin' off down there.

2008
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,375
(whistling)

2009
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:20,417
He's not down here.

2010
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:22,805
- [Man] Check upstairs again.

2011
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:31,105
(dramatic music)

2012
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:57,965
(gunshots banging)

2013
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,635
(shattering)

2014
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,724
(gunshot banging)

2015
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,480
(thudding)

2016
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:19,602
Come on!

2017
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,406
(Ferdie groaning)

2018
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,567
- [Ferdinand] 0h!

2019
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:28,871
- Get him, get him, get him!

2020
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,296
(fist thudding)

2021
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,414
- Catch it, catch it.

2022
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:43,052
(thudding)
- Ow!

2023
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,170
- [Gangster] Get him, Harry!

2024
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,556
- Don't shoot me!

2025
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:51,008
(shattering)

2026
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,259
Excuse me.

2027
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,093
- Throw me the bag.
- Huh?

2028
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:54,803
- Throw me the bag.
- You want it?

2029
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,315
- [Chuck] Yes, throw it over.

2030
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:03,702
(women screaming)
(crashing)

2031
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,450
(shattering)

2032
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,361
(sirens wailing)

2033
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,915
- [Gangster] Beat it, the cops!

2034
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:17,868
(pounding on door)

2035
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:21,664
(imitating sirens wailing)

2036
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:22,581
- Ferdie!

2037
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,791
- Did I scare 'em?

2038
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:24,792
- My hero!

2039
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:25,960
You scared those gangsters away.

2040
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,545
- And he did it single handed.

2041
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:29,713
- Oh boy, get a load.
- Money.

2042
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:30,923
- Come on, put it down.
- Money.

2043
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,007
- Put it in, put it back in the bag.

2044
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:32,967
- Put it down.
- Put it down, put it down.

2045
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:33,884
- Yes, this is ours, you know?

2046
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:34,969
- Yeah, I'm gonna divide it myself.

2047
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:36,053
- Come on, divide it up, divide it up.

2048
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,179
- Okay, I'm gonna divide it.

2049
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,013
There's one for you.
- Mm hm.

2050
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:38,847
- One for me.

2051
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,015
- Two for you, one, two for me.

2052
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,809
Three for you, one, two, three for me.

2053
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,644
Four for you, one, two,
three, four for me.

2054
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:45,229
- Wait a minute, how are you counting?

2055
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,981
One for me, four for you?
- It's honorable.

2056
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:47,815
- What, that's legitimate.
- Oh, no.

2057
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:48,691
We don't count that way.

2058
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:49,525
We'll count later on.

2059
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:50,359
- Oh boy.

2060
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,568
- Say you know, with all this money,

2061
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,404
we could open a chain of gas stations!

2062
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:54,780
- Or you could make more money right here.

2063
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,823
- How?
- How?

2064
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,032
- The spring waters in this place

2065
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,575
have enormous therapeutic values.

2066
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,744
- Uh oh, uh oh. Did you
hear what the doc said?

2067
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:03,372
The spring water, it's
got wonder (stuttering),

2068
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,456
the word he said, it's good.

2069
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,250
- You could open a great health resort.

2070
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,626
- Hm.
- With music?

2071
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,460
- Why not?

2072
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,921
The water here will make sick
people feel like dancing.

2073
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,006
- That's just it.
- Do you hear that, Chuck?

2074
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,007
- What?
- The water will make

2075
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,550
the people dance, water will.

2076
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,218
Remember what we said at
the gas station, Chuck?

2077
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,012
If we ever had a place like
this, we'll hire Ted Lewis.

2078
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:18,846
- Ted Lewis.
- And we'll hire

2079
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:20,639
the Andrews Sisters.
- Yes!

2080
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,224
- Great.
- How do you like that?

2081
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,445
- [Ted] Is everybody happy?

2082
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,688
(audience applauding)

2083
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:29,565
- Ferdie, look around.

2084
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,400
Our opening night, the
place is packed and jammed.

2085
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,234
- We're doing all right business.

2086
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,402
- Marvelous, swell.

2087
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:36,030
Now, see that every dollar
goes in that cash register.

2088
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,032
I don't want to check up
tonight and find you short.

2089
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,616
- Wait a minute, what's my size got to do

2090
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,617
with putting money in the register?

2091
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:41,452
- Nevermind, you just do as you're told.

2092
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:42,995
- Hello, boys.
- Well, Hello Doc.

2093
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:43,871
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2094
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,497
- Now wait a minute, I
thought Chuck and I told you

2095
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:46,874
two to take a week off for a honeymoon.

2096
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:48,917
- 0h we're going to, but we
couldn't miss the opening night.

2097
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,294
Say, what happened to Camille?

2098
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:51,962
- Me and her, we had a runaway marriage.

2099
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:53,130
- A runaway marriage?

2100
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,256
- Yeah, yeah.

2101
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,716
She bought the license and I run away.

2102
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:56,800
(chuckling)

2103
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,135
- Come on, dear.
- Well, take care of things.

2104
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,345
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

2105
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:00,929
(cash register ringing)

2106
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,097
What was that?

2107
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,599
- I didn't know they had a bell on it.

2108
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:04,558
- Well put it away.

2109
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,611
- I'm putting it away.

2110
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,813
(whistling)

2111
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,190
Oh, good, check, huh?
- Yes, sir.

2112
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,734
- We're having quite a run
on that peudatonic water?

2113
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,204
- Yes, sir.
- I think so too.

2114
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,041
Thank you, thank you.

2115
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:21,825
Oh.

2116
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:24,129

2117
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,957
Same employment agency
send you that sent me?

2118
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,125
- Yeah.

2119
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:30,928
- Fix your tie.

2120
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,087

(chuckling)

2123
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,301
You gotta be neat around here
or I'll have to throw you out!

2124
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:40,803
- Throw who out?
- I'll throw you out.

2125
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,596
Don't you think I can do it?
- No!

2126
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,108
- I don't think I can either.

2127
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,142
Excuse me.

2128
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,977
Oh, $23 check.

That's it.

2134

2135
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,201
