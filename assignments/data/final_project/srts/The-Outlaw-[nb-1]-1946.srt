1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000


2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,074


3
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:57,329
Doc Holiday just got off
the stagecoach.

4
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,559
- Want me and the boys to come along?
- Why do you ask that?

5
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:09,091
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to
fool around with him alone.

6
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,830
I don't blame ya, but I'm not gonna
make any trouble for Doc Holiday.

7
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:14,565
He's my best friend.

8
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,733
As long as I'm sheriff around here
the place is his.

9
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,710
Hi. Where's Doc Holiday?

10
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,712
In here, Pat.

11
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:36,441
Hi, Pat.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.

12
00:02:36,518 --> 00:02:38,346
Doc, how are you?

13
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,749
You're looking plenty sassy.

14
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,118
You wintered kind of fat,
didn't you?

15
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:46,917
- What are you doing over this way?
- I wanted to have a talk with you.

16
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,686
The other is, have you seen anything
of a little strawberry roan?

17
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,850
- Somebody steal your horse?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,860
Cutest little fellow you ever saw.

19
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:58,520
Mean as mean, but I'd dote on him
like he was pure rock candy.

20
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,557
- What are you laughing at?
- Joke's on whoever done it.

21
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:09,568
First time I ever felt sorry
for a horse thief.

22
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:13,626
- Did you hear he was headed this way?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:16,366
Put that on the table in there.
What are you gonna have?

24
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,873
I started with rye.
I don't see no cause to change.

25
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:23,877
- Where you been keeping yourself?
- Mostly across the border.

26
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:25,933
That's what I want to see you about.

27
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,844
I need a little money and I thought
you might want to come in with me.

28
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:33,637
- What's the matter?
- I'll let you have the money...

29
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:38,547
but if the deal is like that last one
of yours, better not tell me about it.

30
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:40,448
Why not?

31
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:55,192
- Where'd you get that thing?
- They stuck it on me little while ago.

32
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:58,625
You're the last man I ever thought
would be so easily satisfied.

33
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:01,858
Man's gotta settle down sometime.

34
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,761
Mike, did you see anything
of a strange strawberry roan?

35
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:13,064
About 13 hands high
and as cute as bug's ear.

36
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:17,893
Seems to me I did see one
about that size.

37
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:21,408
- When I came on duty.
- Where?

38
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:24,135
- Up in front of the dentist place.
- Where's that?

39
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,800
I'll show you.

40
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,740
I'm only gonna tell you once more.

41
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,576
You put that glass...

42
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:40,379
on top of your head.

43
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:42,420
But what are you gonna do then?

44
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,476
Just put it up on your head.
I'll show you.

45
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:50,484
Best thing in the world
for that dandruff of yours.

46
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,490
Wait a minute, Doc.

47
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,727
Hello, Fred.

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,752
Hello, Pat.

49
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:04,153
You're still using that one, huh?

50
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,564
My old standby.
Never has failed yet.

51
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,564
How many fingers do you see, Fred?

52
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:18,934
I guess I better take Fred to the jail
and let him sober up there.

53
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:22,271
You go ahead. The dentist's place
is up the street near the corner.

54
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:24,603
I'll be along in a minute.

55
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:50,988
Well, Red, how ya feelin'?

56
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,592
Hello.

57
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:03,189
- Nice little horse you got here.
- I think so.

58
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:07,392
- Where'd you get him?
- Bought him in Santa Fe Springs. Why?

59
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:11,058
Somebody stole him from me
in Sacora.

60
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:17,070
If it wasn't for those two guns,
I'd say you was hiding in pretty young.

61
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:22,474
- You think it was me?
- You haven't told me any different.

62
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,097
I ain't going to.

63
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:27,576
My name's Holiday.

64
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:31,143
Doc Holiday?

65
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,643
- I've heard of you.
- Thanks.

66
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:37,977
I don't want to
take advantage of you.

67
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:41,143
Thanks. I thought it'd be
the other way around.

68
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:43,083
What's your name, son?

69
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,915
Bonny. William Bonny.

70
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:51,284
- Billy the Kid, huh?
- Still think I stole your horse?

71
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:55,622
- How much did you pay for him?
- Wouldn't do any good if I told you.

72
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:59,092
- Why not?
- I like the horse and got used to him.

73
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:01,652
- So have I.
- I don't blame you.

74
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,252
- Just like sitting in a rocking chair.
- Now look...

75
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,855
- Hear you're pretty good.
- That's what I hear about you.

76
00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:09,662
All right. You mind standing away
from the front of that horse?

77
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:12,064
Pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

78
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:14,762
No sense in going to
all this trouble for nothing.

79
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:16,464
That's right.

80
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,470
Hello, Doc.

81
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,233
Had any luck?

82
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,229
- Yes and no.
- It's your horse, ain't it?

83
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:25,899
It was.

84
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:28,977
You're a cool one.

85
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:32,773
Better get you over to the hoosegow
before this gets around.

86
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:36,145
Come along. Thanks, Doc,
for being so forbearing.

87
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,544
All right.

88
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:40,607
See why I left off?
He's just a kid.

89
00:07:40,684 --> 00:07:43,446
I told you to come along.
Didn't you hear what I said?

90
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:45,508
I heard you.

91
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,679
You're not doing any better
than I did.

92
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:52,121
Wait a minute. I'd like to make you
acquainted with this young man.

93
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,715
Billy, this is an old friend
of mine, Pat Garrett.

94
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,813
Pat, this is Mr. William Bonny.

95
00:08:04,663 --> 00:08:07,723
I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

96
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,733
How are you, Billy?

97
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,167
How many fingers do you see?

98
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:19,295
You ought to use that
only on friends.

99
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:24,272
While you two are talking I better
put my horse away. Back up, boy.

100
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,434
- Why you...
- Hold it. Don't fly off the handle.

101
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,374
Nice little horse, ain't he, Doc?

102
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,718
- Remember me?
- Where's Mr. Garrett?

103
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,882
I sent him home. How 'bout you and me
having a little talk?

104
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,588
I don't believe in talk, unless
the other fella holds all the cards.

105
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,987
Sonny, that head of yours
sure is screwed on tight.

106
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:11,761
If it wasn't, somebody would have
knocked it off long ago.

107
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:17,268
I guess that's right. How did you know
Pat was gonna hit you out there?

108
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:21,932
Well, it's the first time a sheriff
ever wanted to shake hands with me.

109
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,941
- He heard you say "shake hands."
- Huh?

110
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:36,081
How do you do, Mr. Horse?
I'm pleased to meet you.

111
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:41,916
I'll swear, I didn't know
he could do tricks.

112
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,075
What else can he do?

113
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:48,349
You back up there and I'll make him take
those gloves right out of your belt.

114
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:53,352
Over that way a little.

115
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:57,089
Now back a little farther.

116
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,989
That's far enough, kid.

117
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,493
Put your hands up.

118
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,495
All right, Doc.

119
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:17,558
- This is new for you, ain't it?
- What?

120
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:20,264
Bein' arrested for horse stealin'.

121
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:23,463
Doc, you know I didn't steal that horse
any more than you did.

122
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:29,972
Billy, many a true word
is spoken in jest.

123
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,737
This is something new
for you too, isn't it, Doc?

124
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:38,940
Yeah, what's that?

125
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:43,278
The Great Doc Holiday
getting someone else to help him.

126
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:46,782
And a policeman at that.

127
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:51,520
I can hardly believe it.

128
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:55,750
And after the way I've heard
people talk about you...

129
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:58,519
ever since I was in short pants.

130
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,117
That's enough of that.
Turn around.

131
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,820
- Now walk out that door.
- Wait a minute.

132
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:05,384
Why?

133
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:09,058
Well, this thing don't seem to sit
right on my stomach, no how.

134
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:10,722
What?

135
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:15,460
Doc, you're not gonna
back out on me?

136
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,499
I'm afraid I am.

137
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,164
I'd never hear the end of this.

138
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:27,400
Hold on!
I'm not through with you yet.

139
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:31,373
Step aside, Doc.
He may shoot me in the back.

140
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:34,674
They tell me that's the way
you've given it to some of the boys.

141
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:37,804
Now, Pat, that's
a pretty strong thing to say.

142
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,973
I never heard that.

143
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,573
Well, Mr. Garrett,
if you believe that...

144
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,744
here's your chance
to do the same to me.

145
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,122
Coming, Doc?

146
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,392
I think I will.

147
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:50,817
I want the two of you
out of this town by sundown.

148
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:52,684
What did I do?

149
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,121
That's all right, Doc.

150
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,918
You've got the right
to choose your friends.

151
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:05,060
Shucks. I don't take kindly
to that at all.

152
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:07,756
He knows there's no stage
until tomorrow...

153
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:10,490
and he knows that I'm afoot.

154
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:12,498
Or am I?

155
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,462
- Not by a darn sight.
- You mean that, son?

156
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:20,026
Sure. We'll dig you up
another horse somewhere.

157
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,856
- I guess that's enough for me.
- Cleaned out?

158
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:19,869
Not quite.

159
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:28,202
- Where you stoppin', son?
- I got a room at the hotel.

160
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,297
Doc, could I see you a minute?

161
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:32,569
Sure. You might as well
cash me in.

162
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:34,235
All right.

163
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,280
What's on your mind, son?

164
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:44,076
No offense, Doc,
but that last ace you just drew...

165
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,174
What about it?

166
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,944
I got a feeling I saw it
on the bottom of the deck.

167
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:52,953
- Are you sure?
- Wouldn't have asked if I was.

168
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:55,080
That's where you showed good sense.

169
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:57,918
Here you are, Doc... 640.

170
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,582
Thanks.

171
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,253
You could have paid four times
for the horse and still saved money.

172
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:07,888
That's right.
Hope you're satisfied now.

173
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:10,293
- You gonna turn in?
- I think I will.

174
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:13,992
I'll walk down to the hotel with you.
Good night, gents, and thanks.

175
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,656
Good night.

176
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:26,773
If you're not already fixed up,
you can bunk with me tonight.

177
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,634
No thanks, Billy.

178
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:32,198
I've got a girl. She and her aunt
just moved into town.

179
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:36,308
You got a girl?

180
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:39,835
I ain't got nothin',
except that horse.

181
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:44,610
You can't fool me. A good-looking boy
like you must have a girl somewhere.

182
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:47,276
No. I don't trust 'em.

183
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,611
You're pretty young
to talk like that.

184
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:53,085
Well, I've known quite a few.

185
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:56,780
And they all did you dirty, eh,
every one of them?

186
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,346
Yeah, every one of 'em.

187
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:02,288
That's too bad, Billy.

188
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:05,623
I guess things haven't been
so easy for you, have they?

189
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,690
Tell you what I'm going to do.

190
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:13,596
Since that horse means so much to you,
I'm going to make you a present of him.

191
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,689
That's awful nice of you.
Thanks a lot.

192
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,633
All right. Good night.
See you in the morning.

193
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:20,828
Good night.

194
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,790
Just thought I'd say good night
to the horse.

195
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,730
If you're all through, you might as well
put him back in his stall.

196
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,390
All right.

197
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:23,160
Good night, Red.
See you tomorrow.

198
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:24,897
What, no kiss?

199
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:27,064
He don't like mush.

200
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,401
Back in your stall, Red.

201
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,601
- That's my tobacco, isn't it?
- I think it is.

202
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:39,168
You don't mind if I take that,
do you?

203
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:54,182
Red, I think I'll bunk right here
tonight, if you don't object.

204
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:44,244
Say, what is this anyway?

205
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:47,337
What are you shooting at me for?

206
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,348
Are you crazy?

207
00:20:57,254 --> 00:21:00,187
Stop it.
Cut it out, do you hear?

208
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:04,087
Can you understand English?

209
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,117
What's your name?

210
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:11,821
- Rio.
- What's the rest of it?

211
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,124
McDonald.

212
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:25,035
Where'd you come from?

213
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:27,467
What do you care?

214
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,403
- Where'd you live before you came here?
- Sacora.

215
00:21:35,707 --> 00:21:39,108
Oh, yeah. Who was he?

216
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:40,972
My brother.

217
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,673
He shouldn't have taken
so much tequila.

218
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:53,739
- What became of the girl?
- She married a guy two weeks later.

219
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:56,786
Well, that's the way it is.

220
00:21:56,853 --> 00:22:00,911
How'd I know he was your brother?
It was him or me.

221
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,115
And I didn't lay for him
in no barn neither.

222
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:13,825
- I'm sorry I was so rough with you.
- You didn't hurt me.

223
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:16,021
You sure?

224
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,788
- It's too bad I didn't know.
- What?

225
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:24,835
- He was your brother.
- What's that got to do with it?

226
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:29,165
Well, maybe I wouldn't have tried
so hard to get the other girl.

227
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:32,339
Oh, you wouldn't.

228
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:38,275
What's the matter?

229
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:41,673
- There's a rock under here.
- Let me fix it.

230
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,753
Let me go!

231
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:01,912
Hold still, lady, or you won't
have much dress left.

232
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,556
Let me go!

233
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:22,825
- He did not.
- I say he did.

234
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,164
- Did you really hear him holler?
- Sure I did.

235
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:27,531
- So did I.
- Then that ain't Billy the Kid.

236
00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:30,070
Shucks, a dentist can make
anybody holler.

237
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:32,072
Look out.
Here he comes.

238
00:23:33,972 --> 00:23:36,202
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Doc.
- I'm in no hurry.

239
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:38,936
- You're the Billy the Kid?
- That's what they tell me.

240
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,670
- See, what did I tell you?
- Wait. One at a time.

241
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:45,144
Have you really got
20 notches in your gun?

242
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:47,678
Is it true you got 13 Indian scalps
in your war bag?

243
00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:51,079
Had to throw 'em away.
The moths got to them.

244
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,411
Tanning 'em
the best way to keep them.

245
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:55,780
- Is that a fact?
- That's what my pa told me.

246
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,286
- What are you doing with that?
- Trying get bark off to make a whistle.

247
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,719
- Have you sucked it?
- I sucked it till it near dry.

248
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:05,052
Can't you shoot
the insides out?

249
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:10,051
- Put it up on that post.
- Can't I hold it?

250
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:12,854
- Can you hold it steady?
- Sure!

251
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:16,794
Billy, you don't have to
prove anything to me.

252
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,192
It's all right.
Turn the end up a little.

253
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:21,094
Little more.

254
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,431
You hit it!

255
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:34,427
- Don't you take aim?
- I took aim.

256
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:36,700
- When?
- Before I drew.

257
00:24:36,774 --> 00:24:40,537
Look, Billy, it's all right.
You fixed it fine. Thanks.

258
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:44,237
- Glad to help.
- Anything I can do, let me know.

259
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:46,368
- That's a new one on me.
- What?

260
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,036
Aiming before you draw.

261
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,944
- I've got to.
- Why?

262
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:52,108
My hand seems to be
a little quicker than my eye.

263
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:54,445
Well, ain't that too bad.

264
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:59,583
- Where'd you get the horse?
- I bought this one.

265
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:02,246
- Looks all right.
- He'll do for the time being.

266
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:10,588
Ham and eggs.
Fry the eggs on both sides.

267
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,955
I'll take the same.
Mine straight up.

268
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:17,392
How 'bout a cold hand
while we're waiting?

269
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:19,055
How much?

270
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:24,932
- How's that?
- Suits me.

271
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,933
Before you get started
I'd like to speak to you for a minute.

272
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:31,627
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

273
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:43,433
- What do you want?
- Let's go in the backroom.

274
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,307
Why?

275
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,106
You don't know me,
but we have a mutual friend.

276
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,942
Who?

277
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:52,775
And I don't like him
any better than you do.

278
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:55,111
Oh, Garrett, eh?

279
00:25:55,183 --> 00:25:57,617
The name sounds familiar.

280
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:13,791
- Figure on staying in town tonight?
- Why?

281
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:17,420
Everybody knows that Garrett
told you to get out of town.

282
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:20,826
Sooner or later you're gonna have
a little trouble with him.

283
00:26:20,897 --> 00:26:22,831
I thought I might give you a hand.

284
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:25,592
That's very kind of you, mister.

285
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:28,600
Listen. I ain't doing you
no favor.

286
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:32,868
It'll be a pleasure.

287
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:39,562
Now what I figure is when he's arguing
with you, he won't watch anyone else.

288
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,268
So, it'll be a cinch for me.

289
00:26:42,343 --> 00:26:45,276
Be careful you don't knock me over
with the same bullet.

290
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:47,903
Don't worry.
I'll stand at an angle.

291
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:49,913
I'll do it like this.

292
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:57,047
Suppose this chair
is Garrett there.

293
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:59,845
And if you're standing about
where you are...

294
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,149
why, I'll be over here.

295
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,811
Do you mind if I draw my gun
so you can see the line of fire?

296
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:09,823
No, go right ahead.

297
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,327
- It's me, Billy.
- Come on in, Doc.

298
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:33,999
- What happened?
- He's a pretty smart hombre.

299
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:38,896
You know him?

300
00:27:38,972 --> 00:27:43,500
He's been hanging around trying to talk
Garrett into making him a deputy.

301
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:47,372
I guess he figured if he got Billy
he'd be a hero...

302
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:51,380
he could have the deputy job,
or run for governor if he wanted it.

303
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:56,845
- Better get out of here, son.
- Why? He pulled on me first.

304
00:27:56,917 --> 00:28:00,247
- Be hard to make Garrett believe that.
- We'll see.

305
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:27,857
Where's my dough?

306
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:32,400
Well, I guess I must've
picked it up.

307
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:38,261
You're foolish to stick around, son.

308
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:41,466
I think I'd be more foolish
to pull out.

309
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:44,135
Then Garrett would be sure
that was my fault.

310
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:48,172
Come on. Cut for deal.

311
00:28:48,245 --> 00:28:51,214
- You meant you want to play poker.
- That's right.

312
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:02,210
You're not worried about me
if I tangle with Garrett, are you?

313
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,652
Fights pretty good.

314
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,746
I know him better than you do.

315
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:11,948
All right, if he's so good...

316
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:15,220
then you'll get your horse back,
won't you?

317
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:17,557
Say, I never thought of that.

318
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,903
What's the matter?

319
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:45,065
Nothing.

320
00:29:47,544 --> 00:29:51,910
- Lend me a hundred.
- I never lend money in a poker game.

321
00:29:51,978 --> 00:29:54,378
Spoils my luck.

322
00:29:54,448 --> 00:29:57,713
But I'd be glad to have you
put up the horse for a hundred.

323
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:02,652
I guess you would.

324
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:14,791
Hello, Pat.

325
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:33,424
Care for a bite to eat, boys?
A little hand of poker?

326
00:30:33,502 --> 00:30:35,436
No thanks, Doc.

327
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,164
Were you in there
when it happened?

328
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:46,836
No. But listen, Pat,
he pulled on Billy first.

329
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:50,367
- How do you know?
- His gun was on the floor.

330
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,673
That don't prove nothing.

331
00:30:56,983 --> 00:31:01,314
Pat, you've got an ugly temper and
you're letting it get the best of you.

332
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:04,508
You have no right to hold Billy
for this killing, and you know it.

333
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:07,281
You're just sore at him,
that's all.

334
00:31:07,354 --> 00:31:11,583
Doc, I'm gonna give you a chance
to stay out of this.

335
00:31:11,656 --> 00:31:14,954
- Thanks.
- Your horse is outside. Get on him.

336
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:19,756
- Good luck to you.
- Same to you.

337
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,396
What are you waitin' for?

338
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:31,027
He's waiting for those chickens
of yours to hatch.

339
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,966
Are you gonna put up a fight?

340
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:39,300
I'll tell you one thing.

341
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:42,135
I ain't going to jail
for no killing I was pushed into.

342
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:08,151
- Thanks, Doc.
- What are you trying to do?

343
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:11,153
I still think that fella
pulled first on Billy.

344
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:18,716
Are you throwing off on me again?
Then what do you call it?

345
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:24,093
Since I figure that this is a personal
matter between you and Billy...

346
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:28,326
I don't think you ought to
bring in all this hired help.

347
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,891
I only did that to keep Billy
from putting up a fight...

348
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:34,901
so I wouldn't have to kill him.

349
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:39,334
Do you stuff birds too?

350
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:43,506
You're making a big mistake...

351
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:47,599
turning on an old friend,
all because of a little snip...

352
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:51,439
who's never given anybody nothing
except the back of his hand.

353
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,875
Speaking of hands...

354
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:01,942
Come on. Let's get out of here
before this hothead makes us plug him.

355
00:33:02,018 --> 00:33:04,677
He ain't gonna run me
out of town.

356
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,720
If you wanna hold the fort while
I ride off on your little horse...

357
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,051
it's all right with me.

358
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,153
Well, since you put it that way.

359
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,431
Go ahead, son.

360
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,805
Take it easy, Pat.

361
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:56,677
Doc, this finishes you and me
for good and all.

362
00:33:58,113 --> 00:33:59,705
I'm sorry.

363
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,742
- Can you get up, son?
- I don't know.

364
00:34:11,254 --> 00:34:14,382
- Can you make it to the horse?
- I think so.

365
00:35:14,557 --> 00:35:19,355
Did you see what that little horse did,
pulling me out like that?

366
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:23,552
He's a regular bird dog.
I gotta get you under cover some place.

367
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:25,561
I'm all right.

368
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:33,088
Charlie, you better stay here
and have a look around town.

369
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:36,693
That kid's got a bullet in him.
He ain't going far. Let's go.

370
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:01,145
Who's that?

371
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:03,146
Quit that yelling.

372
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,213
Get these horses out of sight.

373
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:41,327
This is Billy the Kid.
He got a bad one on the left side...

374
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:45,031
but the bullet didn't hit anything vital
and it came out in the back.

375
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:48,596
Don't move him at all
or the bleeding will start again.

376
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:50,766
I guess you better
cut his clothes off.

377
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:54,140
Put a bandage on the wound
and see that it's always moist.

378
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:58,372
Keep him warm and dry.
If he gets a chill, he's a goner.

379
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:02,504
If he goes out of his head,
tie him down.

380
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:06,244
The neighbors hear him yelling,
tell them your aunt has smallpox.

381
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:08,650
That'll keep them away.

382
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:12,353
I guess that's all.

383
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:19,650
Now do your best for this boy.

384
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:25,989
If I can't come back,
I'll send word where I am.

385
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:28,496
And Billy can bring you along.

386
00:38:11,586 --> 00:38:13,178
Shoo, shoo!

387
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,622
Face like a baby.

388
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,320
He's so hot.

389
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:36,299
He's no hotter
than your brother Julio was.

390
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:40,529
He's soaking wet again.

391
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:42,729
Get me some sheets,
Aunt Guadalupe.

392
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:44,895
Get them yourself.

393
00:38:44,971 --> 00:38:49,031
- What's the matter with you?
- I wouldn't lift a finger for him.

394
00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:59,479
What's the matter?

395
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,878
- Been lookin' for him around here.
- Well, ain't that too bad.

396
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:11,975
Chico, what's the matter with you?

397
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:14,112
He smells the blood.

398
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:20,089
He was just getting ready
to peck his eyes out.

399
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,487
You stay out of here.

400
00:39:32,665 --> 00:39:35,961
- Your name McDonald?
- What do you wanna know for?

401
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:38,364
Why don't you wanna tell me?

402
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:42,094
- Yes, that's my name. Why?
- Your father's name is...

403
00:39:42,168 --> 00:39:44,693
Woodruff. Charlie Woodruff.

404
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:47,262
I used to work for him
when he was Tom Motsacoro.

405
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:52,367
Oh, yes. I guess I was
a little girl then.

406
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:56,900
- Charlie!
- Aunt Guadalupe!

407
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,105
- How you been?
- Very well. Thank you.

408
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,010
You're getting fat as a pig.

409
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,049
- What are you doing up here?
- I've been working with the sheriff.

410
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:09,143
We're looking for Billy the Kid.

411
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:11,582
You get out of here!

412
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:18,846
- Come in and sit down.
- Some other time.

413
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:21,653
I'll drop in
the first chance I get.

414
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:24,157
- What's wrong with that bird?
- Nothing.

415
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:27,058
I have a hen sitting under the bed
and he likes to peck at her.

416
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:30,117
- Want me to get him out of there?
- No. Everything's all upset in there.

417
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:33,255
We just got up.
Good-bye. I'm glad to have seen you.

418
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,819
Same here.
So long, Aunt Guadalupe.

419
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:39,561
- I'll walk down a ways with you.
- No, you won't. Lunch is all ready.

420
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:41,432
Good-bye.

421
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,171
I'll fix you.

422
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:04,680
How's Billy?

423
00:41:04,748 --> 00:41:07,273
Looks like he's having a chill.

424
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,938
A chill?

425
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:19,581
Where are you?

426
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:21,283
Right here.

427
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,983
- Don't go away.
- I won't.

428
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,292
- I'm so cold.
- I'll get you warm.

429
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,227
- Don't go away.
- I'll only be a minute.

430
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,193
How can you stop
a thing like this?

431
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,805
- You're mad at me.
- No.

432
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:55,966
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

433
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:59,034
- Why do you hide from me?
- I'll be right back.

434
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:05,009
- Where's that bottle of whiskey?
- I finished it.

435
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:07,549
The time I had that bad cough.

436
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:19,221
I fired those hot stones for Julio,
but it was just the same.

437
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:23,982
He shook like a leaf
till he died.

438
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,931
You get out of here
and shut the door.

439
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:44,630
What?

440
00:42:48,272 --> 00:42:50,670
Just get out of here.

441
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,104
Have you gone crazy?

442
00:42:56,842 --> 00:43:00,300
You can bring the minister tomorrow
if it'll make you feel better about it.

443
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:02,310
Now get out.

444
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:13,519
You're not gonna die.

445
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:15,519
I'll get you warm.

446
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:53,531
Well, Red, you can't stand
this pace much longer.

447
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:56,699
I guess I'll just have to
slow those boys down a little.

448
00:44:09,248 --> 00:44:13,048
None of my affair, but we crossed
the county line ten minutes ago.

449
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,449
That's right, Swanson.
It's none of your affair.

450
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,064
Break up!
Scatter for those rocks!

451
00:45:14,984 --> 00:45:17,646
You look different today.
You look better.

452
00:45:20,656 --> 00:45:23,554
Say, is that you?

453
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,422
What are you doing here?

454
00:45:31,461 --> 00:45:33,224
I live here.

455
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:37,887
Well, I've been trying
to figure this out.

456
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:41,458
- How'd I get here?
- Doc brought you.

457
00:45:44,668 --> 00:45:48,125
Oh. Are you Doc's girl?

458
00:45:51,472 --> 00:45:54,134
What do you know about that.

459
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:57,333
Be careful your wound.
You'll hurt yourself.

460
00:45:57,408 --> 00:45:59,569
That's right. I remember now.

461
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:02,940
- I caught one yesterday, didn't I?
- Yesterday?

462
00:46:05,714 --> 00:46:09,238
It was a month ago.
You've been terribly sick.

463
00:46:09,314 --> 00:46:12,681
A month? That's a long time.

464
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,649
- How's Red?
- Red?

465
00:46:15,718 --> 00:46:19,017
- Have you been takin' good care of him?
- Who's Red?

466
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:22,054
Didn't Doc leave my horse here?

467
00:46:22,121 --> 00:46:26,387
Well, I'll swear. I didn't think
he'd do a thing like that.

468
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,424
Behind my back too.

469
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:36,488
Is he all right again?

470
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:38,827
Say, who's this old lollipop?

471
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:40,625
It's my Aunt Guadalupe.

472
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,494
żQué tal? żCómo está?

473
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,262
You haven't got a ham sandwich
on you?

474
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:49,268
You hungry? I don't think we have
anything cooked beside some beans.

475
00:46:49,336 --> 00:46:52,499
That'll do for a starter,
eh, lollipop?

476
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:55,061
Say, you don't talk
like a sick man.

477
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:57,073
Who said I was?

478
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:06,042
What does that "lollipop" mean?

479
00:47:07,447 --> 00:47:09,538
Oh, something sweet.

480
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:11,377
Sweet?

481
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:14,643
Sweet, like candy.
You know, dulce.

482
00:47:17,552 --> 00:47:19,485
Is that a fact?

483
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,556
Where are you going?

484
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:32,560
Oh, to see if I can find
a fresh egg or two.

485
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:48,297
- How do you feel?
- Fine. When do we eat?

486
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:51,667
- You just had lunch about an hour ago.
- Honest?

487
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,537
Will you bring me my clothes?
I want to have a look around.

488
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,906
What for?

489
00:48:02,443 --> 00:48:05,207
I can't spend the rest of my life
in bed.

490
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:08,507
Anyway, I want to see
if I can find my ring.

491
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:10,171
Your ring?

492
00:48:10,248 --> 00:48:14,181
Yeah. I had a ring on this finger
and it's gone.

493
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:16,410
I've been worried about it.

494
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:29,249
You mustn't be upset
about a thing like that.

495
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:31,919
You can get another one,
can't you?

496
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,487
This one's been
kind of lucky for me.

497
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:38,189
It belonged to a fellow who was
supposed to have had a charmed life...

498
00:48:38,264 --> 00:48:40,320
as long as he kept it
on his finger.

499
00:48:42,265 --> 00:48:45,860
Then how did you get it?
Did you kill him?

500
00:48:45,935 --> 00:48:49,834
No. Somebody else did that.

501
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:54,729
Then the ring wasn't so lucky
for him after all, was it?

502
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:58,741
Well, nothing happened to him until
he took it off to wash his hands.

503
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:03,402
No, you better not get up
till tomorrow.

504
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:06,343
- You said that yesterday.
- You're not strong enough yet.

505
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,742
Who says I'm not?

506
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:13,541
Billy, you mustn't.
You'll hurt yourself.

507
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,780
Then why don't you quit
wrestling with me?

508
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:34,054
But you've been so sick.
You're not well enough. You're not...

509
00:49:49,802 --> 00:49:51,394
Rio!

510
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:56,765
Come on. I want you to go
down to the store with me.

511
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,631
I have some washing to do.

512
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:06,699
You've got all afternoon to do it.
Come on.

513
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:14,707
- I have to fix my hair first.
- All right, hurry up then.

514
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,478
- Why do you have to go with her?
- I better.

515
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:22,212
What if somebody should come by...

516
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,880
like that deputy sheriff friend
of yours the other day?

517
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:30,418
Yes, that's right.
I'll go tell Aunt Guadalupe.

518
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:20,583
- Who is it?
- It's me, Doc.

519
00:51:20,651 --> 00:51:22,915
Hurry up!
Open this door here.

520
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:27,145
Coming.

521
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:32,059
Hello, Doc.
Glad to see you, Doc!

522
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:36,150
You'd never know it. I thought
I'd have to break the door down.

523
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:41,685
It's the rain, Doc.
I couldn't hear a thing, Doc.

524
00:51:41,763 --> 00:51:44,493
You don't need to yell so loud.
I'm not deaf.

525
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:49,694
Did you ever see such a storm,
and it's been going on for four days?

526
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:55,294
It was lucky for me. The only way
I could shake those bloodhounds.

527
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,635
Washed out all your tracks, huh?

528
00:52:05,044 --> 00:52:06,303
Hungry?

529
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,368
First sit down I've had
since I left here.

530
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:11,073
How's Billy?

531
00:52:11,147 --> 00:52:14,910
Oh, he's fine, sure.
He's been up almost a week now.

532
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:16,573
Good.

533
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,313
Where's Rio?

534
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:28,713
So that's what
all the yellings about, eh?

535
00:52:28,789 --> 00:52:31,349
- I'll go and call her for you.
- Wait a minute.

536
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:34,357
You made enough noise now
to raise the dead.

537
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:48,599
So that's it?

538
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:52,895
All right, where is he?

539
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:55,129
He's getting dressed.

540
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,302
Maybe I better give him a hand.

541
00:53:02,575 --> 00:53:06,008
No, Doc! Please let me
talk to you first!

542
00:53:07,443 --> 00:53:10,708
What got into you? Were you drunk?
What happened to you?

543
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:13,370
I don't know.

544
00:53:13,446 --> 00:53:16,142
He's a devil.
He did the same to me.

545
00:53:16,216 --> 00:53:18,878
He can charm a bird
right out of a bush.

546
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:26,878
- I never saw it to fail.
- Don't talk that way.

547
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:29,980
What do you want me to say...
bless you, my children?

548
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,280
You might as well.

549
00:53:33,356 --> 00:53:35,518
Huh?

550
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:37,254
I'm married to him.

551
00:53:37,328 --> 00:53:39,124
You're what?

552
00:53:39,826 --> 00:53:42,352
That's the truth, Doc.

553
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,762
Only please don't tell him.

554
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,899
Tell who?

555
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:50,730
Billy.

556
00:53:50,802 --> 00:53:53,893
- You mean he doesn't know it?
- No.

557
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:56,130
Then how could you be
married to him?

558
00:53:56,204 --> 00:53:58,196
He was out of his mind.

559
00:53:59,008 --> 00:54:02,496
I never would have done it,
only I thought he was gonna die.

560
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:06,530
And so he would have,
if it hadn't been for you.

561
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:09,535
I don't want his gratitude.

562
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:20,538
Guess I should've stayed out
in the rain with the sheriff.

563
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:26,944
- Make me a cup of coffee.
- Sure.

564
00:54:28,522 --> 00:54:31,457
It's a good thing
you don't want his gratitude.

565
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:35,848
Why do you say that?

566
00:54:35,926 --> 00:54:38,258
You know, when I come
to think of it...

567
00:54:38,326 --> 00:54:41,351
after what you done to me,
I couldn't wish you anything better...

568
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:44,022
than you hooking up with Billy.

569
00:54:46,731 --> 00:54:48,665
What do you mean?

570
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,562
I wouldn't want
to spoil it for you.

571
00:54:57,338 --> 00:54:58,927
Hello, Doc.

572
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:15,071
Is that all you got to say to me?

573
00:55:15,147 --> 00:55:19,877
Now look here, Doc, I'm sorry,
but it's your own fault.

574
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,585
Oh, my fault, huh?

575
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,483
Who brought me here?

576
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:29,078
Now you want to switch
the blame on me.

577
00:55:29,155 --> 00:55:31,623
First you take my horse,
then my girl...

578
00:55:31,691 --> 00:55:34,418
and both times
it's all my fault.

579
00:55:34,491 --> 00:55:36,925
That reminds me of something else.

580
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:42,387
You ran away with Red, didn't you?

581
00:55:42,462 --> 00:55:44,984
You think that's any excuse?

582
00:55:45,062 --> 00:55:47,997
It was good enough for me.

583
00:55:48,065 --> 00:55:50,727
- There's only one trouble with it.
- What's that?

584
00:55:51,699 --> 00:55:54,167
The horse was mine too.

585
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:57,568
I wasn't in much shape
to argue that with you, was I?

586
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:01,227
No, I guess you weren't.

587
00:56:01,306 --> 00:56:05,437
But you didn't have use for that horse
lying flat on your back, or did you?

588
00:56:09,044 --> 00:56:11,979
All right, Doc,
if that's your way of looking at it.

589
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:16,347
You just took the loan of him,
so to speak.

590
00:56:17,716 --> 00:56:19,647
What are you getting at?

591
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:22,445
Yes, that's what
I'd like to know.

592
00:56:22,518 --> 00:56:24,747
You borrow from me...

593
00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:27,513
I borrow from you.

594
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:29,782
What does that mean?

595
00:56:29,855 --> 00:56:34,289
Let's have a cup of java.
We better be getting out of here.

596
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,921
Not at those prices.

597
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,494
All right, Doc,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

598
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:44,086
What's that?

599
00:56:44,862 --> 00:56:48,126
Well, just to show you
my heart's in the right place...

600
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,728
I'll let you take your pick.

601
00:56:57,802 --> 00:57:00,100
Huh?

602
00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:02,901
You mean you'd trade me
for a horse?

603
00:57:02,974 --> 00:57:07,465
It's up to Doc. After all, I've got
to think of the other fellow, you know.

604
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:13,940
I appreciate that.

605
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:15,604
I sure do.

606
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:19,675
Billy, you don't mean that.

607
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,377
And after all she did for you.

608
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:28,443
Say, you should have seen what
that little horse did for me, huh, Doc?

609
00:57:29,688 --> 00:57:32,347
That's right.

610
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,584
I hope you won't think
too hard of me...

611
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:39,523
but under the circumstances...

612
00:57:39,592 --> 00:57:42,026
I'm going to take the horse.

613
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:45,528
- You are?
- You're not satisfied?

614
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:48,530
Listen, Doc,
I like that little horse.

615
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,291
What'd I tell you, huh?

616
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:57,889
- I still can't believe it.
- What are you talking about?

617
00:57:57,968 --> 00:58:00,528
- Nothing.
- What's eating you?

618
00:58:00,604 --> 00:58:02,162
Nothing!

619
00:58:16,214 --> 00:58:20,011
Here. Fill these with fresh water.
The creeks are muddy as all get out.

620
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:21,673
How about grub?

621
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,510
Can you spare enough flour and bacon
to get us to Fort Sumner?

622
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:27,074
Sure.

623
00:58:27,152 --> 00:58:29,279
Hey, it's clearing up.

624
00:58:29,354 --> 00:58:31,842
We better be getting out of here.

625
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:39,814
Lend me some dough, will you?

626
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:42,258
How much do you want?

627
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:52,155
About 50 bucks.

628
00:58:55,802 --> 00:58:57,733
Here's 40.

629
00:59:06,774 --> 00:59:08,708
Here.

630
00:59:08,776 --> 00:59:11,367
Buy yourself a horse and buggy.

631
00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:16,472
Don't you think it's too much?

632
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:23,175
You can give Aunt Guadalupe 20
if you want.

633
00:59:25,218 --> 00:59:27,946
If we get located in Fort Sumner,
I'll send for you.

634
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:29,611
What for?

635
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:33,280
I can't stand ranch cooking.

636
00:59:39,758 --> 00:59:41,692
Here you are.

637
00:59:51,764 --> 00:59:54,028
- Thanks. Good-bye.
- Bye, Doc.

638
00:59:58,401 --> 01:00:00,335
Bye, lollipop.

639
01:00:04,074 --> 01:00:07,563
Bye, Billy.
Take care of yourself.

640
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:09,575
You do the same.

641
01:00:33,388 --> 01:00:35,652
Fill these up for Doc.

642
01:00:51,997 --> 01:00:54,932
Hello, you old hay bag.
Have ya missed me?

643
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:59,594
He's thin as a rail.

644
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:02,229
He's been getting a little exercise.

645
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:04,395
Where'd you get that plug?

646
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:09,100
Wore out the black horse I had, so I
traded him to sheep herder for this one.

647
01:01:09,175 --> 01:01:12,107
He's all right.
Little wild yet.

648
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:16,039
Come on.

649
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,285
Ain't Red a sweetheart?

650
01:01:47,362 --> 01:01:50,354
I'm going to let you have
a loan of him for a little while.

651
01:01:50,428 --> 01:01:53,956
- Until you get your strength back.
- You're not gonna do me any favors.

652
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,462
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna be obligated about Red.

653
01:01:58,534 --> 01:02:01,799
- Why not?
- I'm not giving up on getting him back...

654
01:02:01,871 --> 01:02:05,702
anymore than I've given up
getting on this ornery goat.

655
01:02:21,648 --> 01:02:23,579
Bye, Rio.

656
01:02:44,562 --> 01:02:47,895
- What's the matter?
- Boy, am I tuckered.

657
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:06,638
- What are you lookin' for?
- A sink of tobacco.

658
01:03:06,709 --> 01:03:09,471
Say, is there anything of mine
you don't cotton to?

659
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:12,010
- I guess I forgot.
- Yeah, it's a bad habit you got.

660
01:03:12,078 --> 01:03:13,705
- What?
- Forgettin' what belongs to others.

661
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:15,712
- You think I did it on purpose?
- Yes.

662
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:19,236
- Listen, I don't feel good as it is.
- Neither do I.

663
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,278
You wanna make something out of it?

664
01:03:23,353 --> 01:03:25,978
- That's a big advantage you're taking.
- I can't help it.

665
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,316
I'm so plumb beat out,
I'll be lucky if I can draw 'em clear.

666
01:03:30,387 --> 01:03:32,116
I don't want to crowd
a sick man.

667
01:03:32,189 --> 01:03:36,216
I'm all right. Just give me 40 winks
and I'll take ya with both hands free.

668
01:03:39,093 --> 01:03:42,494
I guess this is as good
a place as any to make camp.

669
01:03:42,563 --> 01:03:44,322
There's no water.

670
01:03:44,395 --> 01:03:46,488
And you won't find any
between here and Fort Sumner.

671
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:48,498
That's a long ways off.

672
01:03:50,265 --> 01:03:54,497
When we get there our friend,
the sheriff, won't be far behind.

673
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:56,229
Huh?

674
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,732
Garrett?

675
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:11,374
How do you know it's him?

676
01:04:11,443 --> 01:04:13,843
I can tell him farther off
than that.

677
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:16,344
He wouldn't be coming
after the two of us alone.

678
01:04:17,513 --> 01:04:20,277
Maybe he's lost too many
of his friends.

679
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:26,579
How come you didn't knock him over?
Or did you try?

680
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:29,450
- Did I?
- That's what I said. Did ya?

681
01:04:31,655 --> 01:04:33,589
Didn't do nothin' else.

682
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:40,787
Who do you suppose
put him on our trail?

683
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:43,588
Well, maybe somebody saw us
pulling out or...

684
01:04:43,661 --> 01:04:45,253
Or what?

685
01:04:46,664 --> 01:04:48,256
Nothing.

686
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:52,425
- Sure, she was the one.
- Yeah, Rio.

687
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,434
Why do you suppose she had to
up and do a thing like that?

688
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,997
Well, women are funny.

689
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:08,175
Go easy on that water. We've only got
two canteens to get us to Fort Sumner.

690
01:05:11,009 --> 01:05:13,068
What's the matter?

691
01:05:13,145 --> 01:05:14,737
Look!

692
01:05:16,614 --> 01:05:18,546
Sweet spirited miter.

693
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,010
The little darling put sand in it
instead of water.

694
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:24,879
That sure is one for the book.

695
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:29,010
Well, no use hanging 'round here
till morning. Let's get going.

696
01:06:04,672 --> 01:06:07,766
You know, Doc, I think
I'll have another drink.

697
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:11,775
What are you talking about?
You didn't have one in the first place.

698
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,676
No, but I had the same notion
about an hour ago.

699
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:22,344
I know what you're thinking,
but it won't do you any good.

700
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:25,713
- Take my advice.
- What?

701
01:06:25,784 --> 01:06:27,718
Killing a woman.

702
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:34,050
- Why not?
- They're all alike.

703
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:37,055
There isn't anything
they wouldn't do for you...

704
01:06:38,324 --> 01:06:39,916
or to you.

705
01:06:55,769 --> 01:06:59,702
Hey, why didn't you wake me up?
We should've gotten started long ago.

706
01:07:01,538 --> 01:07:03,468
Keep 'em up!

707
01:07:05,573 --> 01:07:06,870
Hello, Pat.

708
01:07:19,981 --> 01:07:22,914
- Where's Billy?
- Looks like he left ya.

709
01:07:25,117 --> 01:07:27,051
And on my horse, eh?

710
01:07:28,286 --> 01:07:29,614
Try those on.

711
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,187
You know me.
Do I have to put these on?

712
01:07:35,253 --> 01:07:38,690
I know ya.
Put 'em on!

713
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:02,061
That was pretty smart,
putting sand in those canteens.

714
01:09:04,137 --> 01:09:06,970
I had to give you something
for your money, didn't I?

715
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:09,166
Oh, I see.

716
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:12,538
So you sent the sheriff after us
for good measure, huh?

717
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:14,600
No wonder he came alone.

718
01:09:14,678 --> 01:09:18,008
All he had to do was take his time
and wait for the sun to finish us off.

719
01:09:19,213 --> 01:09:21,146
Then how did you get back?

720
01:09:22,947 --> 01:09:25,006
It was pretty tough...

721
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:28,484
but the more I thought about
seeing you, darling...

722
01:09:28,551 --> 01:09:30,518
the easier it got.

723
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:36,516
Then what are you waiting for?
Go ahead.

724
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:39,021
Say, that sounds real nice.

725
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,455
I like to hear you ask for it.
Keep it up.

726
01:09:42,524 --> 01:09:44,458
Beg some more.

727
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:55,119
What would you like me to say?

728
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:58,998
Well, you might say "please"
very sweetly.

729
01:10:00,103 --> 01:10:01,400
Please.

730
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:07,366
Will you keep your eyes open?

731
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:09,599
Yes.

732
01:10:09,674 --> 01:10:12,540
Will you look right at me
while I do it?

733
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:55,320
What is it?

734
01:10:55,396 --> 01:10:57,661
Everybody drinks but me.

735
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:00,357
I'm supposed to be a camel, huh?

736
01:11:00,437 --> 01:11:03,834
You want a drink,
you can climb down and get it.

737
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,913
Say, did you hear something?

738
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:30,406
- What kind of a track is that?
- I don't know.

739
01:11:31,485 --> 01:11:33,417
Too small for a man.

740
01:11:34,154 --> 01:11:36,086
Here's another one.

741
01:11:36,988 --> 01:11:38,921
Couple over there.

742
01:11:50,462 --> 01:11:52,895
Well, take a look at that.

743
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,359
Yeah, it's an old Indian trick soaking
rawhide in water to make it shrink.

744
01:12:02,434 --> 01:12:04,868
Another hour, she'd have been hanging
by her wrists.

745
01:12:06,571 --> 01:12:08,764
Well, I'll say one thing for Billy.

746
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:11,432
He sure does pay off poetic.

747
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:14,101
He put her right where
she could see the water.

748
01:12:14,176 --> 01:12:16,108
He just left here
less than half an hour ago.

749
01:12:16,176 --> 01:12:18,110
He went that way,
toward those mountains.

750
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:21,110
- Are you all right? Sit.
- Don't worry about me. Go after him.

751
01:12:21,178 --> 01:12:23,238
- We can't catch him now.
- Why not?

752
01:12:23,312 --> 01:12:26,214
He's got too much
of a head start on us. Sit down.

753
01:12:35,054 --> 01:12:37,282
You know, I think
he's in love with you.

754
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,117
What are you talking about?

755
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:43,783
The crazier a man is about a woman,
the crazier he thinks and does.

756
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:47,451
He's only crazy
about one thing: Himself.

757
01:12:47,525 --> 01:12:50,961
Say, that gives me a thought.

758
01:12:51,029 --> 01:12:53,020
Maybe we'll get Mr. Billy
after all.

759
01:12:53,097 --> 01:12:55,688
- How?
- Just like he says.

760
01:12:55,765 --> 01:12:57,732
If he's crazy enough to do you
like this...

761
01:12:57,799 --> 01:13:00,665
maybe he's just crazy enough
to come back to turn you loose.

762
01:13:00,732 --> 01:13:02,826
You're the one that's crazy.

763
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,563
He doesn't care anything about me.
He'd never come back.

764
01:13:05,637 --> 01:13:10,230
Maybe so, but it's worth trying.
Ain't it, Doc?

765
01:13:10,306 --> 01:13:13,500
If he's fool enough to come back,
he oughta get himself caught.

766
01:13:21,376 --> 01:13:24,540
I told you not to breathe so loud.

767
01:13:24,614 --> 01:13:26,708
All right, all right.

768
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:00,299
Well, how do you like it?

769
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:05,300
I thought I tied it tighter
than that.

770
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:16,505
- You came back.
- Not on your account, I didn't.

771
01:14:16,575 --> 01:14:19,771
- You didn't?
- You see Doc and the sheriff?

772
01:14:19,845 --> 01:14:22,675
Here we are, Billy,
right behind ya.

773
01:14:24,413 --> 01:14:26,676
Now put those hands
where they belong.

774
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,680
Say, why didn't you tip me off?

775
01:14:37,354 --> 01:14:41,617
Hurry up with that grub.
I wanna get to town before dark.

776
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:44,885
- Well, I've only got two hands.
- Why don't you use both of 'em?

777
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:48,482
- I'll use one on you in a minute.
- I wouldn't put it past ya.

778
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:52,928
Now's your chance with me
all trussed up like a chicken.

779
01:14:54,129 --> 01:14:58,462
Here we are together again.
Same old happy family.

780
01:14:58,532 --> 01:15:01,693
Yeah, and I'd have been halfway to
Fort Sumner if it hadn't been for you.

781
01:15:01,766 --> 01:15:04,166
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

782
01:15:04,235 --> 01:15:06,169
Give me a cigarette.

783
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:14,437
- You mean her.
- Rio! Are you out of your mind?

784
01:15:14,507 --> 01:15:19,406
- Come out and admit it like a man.
- Admit what?

785
01:15:19,477 --> 01:15:24,640
You didn't know Pat caught me until
you got back to our camp, did ya?

786
01:15:24,713 --> 01:15:27,837
- Then why come after us?
- Why not?

787
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:31,975
We'd have been clear to Lincoln
before you even got back here.

788
01:15:32,051 --> 01:15:35,312
Say, mister, what are you
trying to make out?

789
01:15:35,385 --> 01:15:38,942
I heard you say once
you didn't like ranch cooking...

790
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:41,543
so I guess you figured you'd better
come back and get Rio.

791
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:43,782
You're daffy. I wouldn't come back
two inches to get her.

792
01:15:43,857 --> 01:15:45,753
- You did.
- I tell you I didn't.

793
01:15:45,826 --> 01:15:48,416
- Actions speak louder than words.
- Do they?

794
01:15:49,993 --> 01:15:52,553
I'll show you how much
I care about her.

795
01:15:52,626 --> 01:15:57,154
If you want her back, you can have her.
Now what do you think about that?

796
01:16:00,267 --> 01:16:02,494
I don't want her.

797
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:06,695
- Cattle don't graze after sheep.
- Sheep?

798
01:16:08,503 --> 01:16:09,936
Sheep did you say?

799
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:12,937
I didn't say goats or monkeys.

800
01:16:13,006 --> 01:16:15,063
Why you.

801
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,040
Ah, sit down.

802
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:30,846
- What's the matter with you?
- None of your business!

803
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:33,249
Careful, young fella.

804
01:16:33,318 --> 01:16:35,580
You want it now?

805
01:16:35,651 --> 01:16:39,780
I've just been waitin'
for an excuse like this.

806
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:45,850
I'll fix you up.

807
01:17:00,931 --> 01:17:06,096
Never mind fixin' any more food.
We're leavin' now. Come on.

808
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,159
Let me get a drink first.

809
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:10,169
All right, hurry up.

810
01:17:17,608 --> 01:17:21,062
Hey, Rio, come here and hold my hands
so I won't fall in.

811
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,452
Come out of there!

812
01:18:15,172 --> 01:18:17,436
You're all right now.
Come on.

813
01:18:26,812 --> 01:18:29,507
You figure on taking us back
to Lincoln, ain't ya?

814
01:18:29,581 --> 01:18:31,708
Where did ya think
I was takin' ya?

815
01:18:31,782 --> 01:18:36,547
- It's over that way, ain't it?
- Sure. What are you gettin' at?

816
01:18:36,618 --> 01:18:38,949
Take a look.

817
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,924
Hey, Doc.

818
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:01,326
Well, the Mescaleros
are out early this year.

819
01:19:01,398 --> 01:19:03,696
They're talkin' about us,
ain't they?

820
01:19:03,767 --> 01:19:08,827
Yeah. They're tippin' off
another hunting party that must be out.

821
01:19:08,902 --> 01:19:10,961
Right over there.

822
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:20,773
On both sides of us.

823
01:19:23,377 --> 01:19:26,104
I guess our best chance
is to hightail it to Fort Sumner.

824
01:19:26,177 --> 01:19:28,236
Don't figure on me
doing much hightailing.

825
01:19:28,312 --> 01:19:30,610
- Why not?
- I ain't no acrobat.

826
01:19:34,284 --> 01:19:36,512
I hope you fellas have sense enough
to behave yourselves.

827
01:19:36,584 --> 01:19:39,106
Sure, Pat, certainly.

828
01:19:39,185 --> 01:19:41,119
Sure, Pat.

829
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:02,057
No, ya don't!

830
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,361
- That's your horse over there.
- Who says so?

831
01:20:04,434 --> 01:20:08,231
I say so.
Get on him and hurry up.

832
01:20:08,301 --> 01:20:10,235
Rio, you ride the paint.

833
01:20:16,606 --> 01:20:17,767
Thanks.

834
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:23,802
Hey, Red's my horse.

835
01:20:25,312 --> 01:20:27,971
I know he is,
but I'm gonna ride him.

836
01:21:28,078 --> 01:21:30,478
I don't like this.

837
01:21:30,547 --> 01:21:33,172
Looks like some of those Mescaleros
are ahead of us too.

838
01:21:33,247 --> 01:21:36,239
No, you better not
come over here, Rio.

839
01:21:36,317 --> 01:21:39,182
- Why not?
- They put the fire on them.

840
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,810
Those Mescaleros sure do play
for keeps.

841
01:21:41,886 --> 01:21:44,480
Say, what's that?

842
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:57,860
It's a good size party. We'll be
knee-deep in them in a minute.

843
01:21:57,929 --> 01:21:59,587
Look over there too.

844
01:22:09,835 --> 01:22:13,600
- Hey, what are ya doin'?
- What do ya think? I want my gun.

845
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:15,261
Now wait a minute.

846
01:22:15,338 --> 01:22:19,104
You're not gonna argue at a time like
this. Aren't you gonna give us a chance?

847
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:22,005
He'd like to see them
put the fire on me.

848
01:22:22,075 --> 01:22:24,005
- I sure would.
- What about her?

849
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:28,373
We can't talk about it now.
I want to know one thing.

850
01:22:28,445 --> 01:22:30,937
Do I have your solemn promise
that you'll give them back when I ask?

851
01:22:31,015 --> 01:22:33,444
- Sure. What do you think we are?
- Will you see to it that he does?

852
01:22:33,518 --> 01:22:35,641
Who's gonna see to it that I do?

853
01:22:35,716 --> 01:22:37,646
I'll take your word for it.

854
01:22:39,916 --> 01:22:41,942
- Where are my cartridges?
- Here you are.

855
01:22:42,019 --> 01:22:44,611
Now what do we do?
Make a stand or run for it?

856
01:22:44,687 --> 01:22:46,653
- Can't make a stand here.
- I know something that might work.

857
01:22:46,721 --> 01:22:50,248
- What is it?
- Come on. Do exactly what I do.

858
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:32,076
Cut him loose!

859
01:26:08,933 --> 01:26:12,661
I know this place. We're about
40 miles from Fort Sumner.

860
01:26:17,501 --> 01:26:19,697
Senor Garrett, what are you
doing out this late?

861
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:22,365
Hello, Pablo.
Can you put us up for the night?

862
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,270
Sure, glad to have you. Come right in.
My house is yours.

863
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,274
I'll take care of the horses.

864
01:26:40,983 --> 01:26:46,079
Well, boys, I guess
we're out of the woods now, huh?

865
01:26:46,153 --> 01:26:49,087
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

866
01:26:56,756 --> 01:27:00,022
I wouldn't be too sure
of that, Pat.

867
01:27:03,164 --> 01:27:05,187
Oh, yes, he's right, Pat.

868
01:27:05,264 --> 01:27:07,423
Those Mescaleros
don't give up so easy.

869
01:27:40,683 --> 01:27:42,775
This is very important.

870
01:27:42,851 --> 01:27:45,146
I want you to ride to Fort Sumner...

871
01:27:45,217 --> 01:27:47,845
and give this note
to the town marshal.

872
01:27:50,956 --> 01:27:53,319
Did he say "town marshal"?

873
01:27:53,389 --> 01:27:55,821
That's what it sounded like to me.

874
01:28:52,556 --> 01:28:54,489
Thanks, Rio.

875
01:29:24,938 --> 01:29:27,533
It certainly is
a beautiful night out.

876
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:32,938
I think I'll take
a little stroll.

877
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:37,846
And, gentlemen, just in case
I shouldn't return before you retire...

878
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:40,642
I'll say good night now.

879
01:29:40,715 --> 01:29:43,412
I think I'll go with ya.

880
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:50,686
Well, Billy, you've been pretty good
to my little horse.

881
01:29:50,754 --> 01:29:54,348
I guess the least I can do
is let you say good-bye to him.

882
01:29:54,423 --> 01:29:56,789
That's awfully nice of you, Doc.

883
01:29:56,857 --> 01:30:00,292
Oh, I always like to think
of the other fella.

884
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:02,850
So if you just stand right here
in this doorway...

885
01:30:02,928 --> 01:30:05,758
and don't make no warlike moves...

886
01:30:05,828 --> 01:30:09,786
then you can wave farewell to 'im
as we ride off.

887
01:30:09,865 --> 01:30:12,491
In other words,
you think you're gonna leave.

888
01:30:12,565 --> 01:30:18,000
I'm sorry, Pat, I hate to eat and run,
but you know how it is.

889
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:23,270
- Listen, Doc.
- You're wasting your time, Pat.

890
01:30:23,339 --> 01:30:25,271
Haven't you forgotten something?

891
01:30:26,774 --> 01:30:30,468
No, I don't think so.
Good night all.

892
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,943
Say, Doc.

893
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:37,068
Yes, what is it?

894
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:40,637
I'm afraid you'll have to listen
to me for a minute.

895
01:30:41,816 --> 01:30:43,747
Why?

896
01:30:48,787 --> 01:30:51,810
What if I don't feel
like waving good-bye to Red?

897
01:30:53,989 --> 01:30:57,046
You still think you got something
to say about that horse, eh?

898
01:30:57,122 --> 01:30:59,181
Yes, I do.

899
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:04,687
All right, go ahead and say it.

900
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:10,291
That's a pretty big advantage
to give a man like you.

901
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:12,297
Didn't you tell me that once?

902
01:31:22,335 --> 01:31:23,734
How's this?

903
01:31:23,805 --> 01:31:26,705
You don't have to go that far.

904
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:30,232
Thanks.

905
01:31:30,309 --> 01:31:33,902
What about him?
Will he leave us alone?

906
01:31:33,977 --> 01:31:37,811
Or do you think we ought to
pull his teeth before we start?

907
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:40,142
Don't worry about me.

908
01:31:40,214 --> 01:31:44,583
I wouldn't lift a finger, Doc,
to keep you from killing him.

909
01:31:44,648 --> 01:31:47,948
You and me never had any trouble
till he came along.

910
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:51,609
He'll keep out of it.

911
01:31:51,686 --> 01:31:54,554
All right, son, I'm waiting.

912
01:31:54,623 --> 01:31:58,020
Put those plates down.
You're makin' me nervous.

913
01:31:59,357 --> 01:32:02,187
- Billy, he'll kill ya.
- What do you care?

914
01:32:02,259 --> 01:32:04,248
- But you can get another horse.
- I want this one.

915
01:32:04,326 --> 01:32:05,918
Why?

916
01:32:05,994 --> 01:32:08,655
I wanna see if I can teach him
to make smoke come out of his ears.

917
01:32:08,729 --> 01:32:10,721
Say, I haven't got all night.

918
01:32:10,796 --> 01:32:13,264
Get back against that wall.

919
01:32:13,332 --> 01:32:15,266
- But Billy...
- Go on!

920
01:32:16,534 --> 01:32:18,557
And count up to three.

921
01:32:18,634 --> 01:32:21,329
I won't. You're outta your mind,
both of ya.

922
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:23,767
How about you, Pat?

923
01:32:24,838 --> 01:32:28,170
Sure, I'll be glad to.

924
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:32,197
You're too willing.
I don't trust you.

925
01:32:41,481 --> 01:32:44,471
I think I'd rather have that
cuckoo clock do the counting for me.

926
01:32:46,851 --> 01:32:50,443
Yeah, that's good enough.
It's gonna strike in a minute.

927
01:32:50,518 --> 01:32:53,078
Should we pull on the last cuckoo?

928
01:32:53,154 --> 01:32:54,916
All right.

929
01:33:01,392 --> 01:33:04,654
Well, Billy, I guess this is it.

930
01:33:04,727 --> 01:33:07,889
Men are pretty much like children
after all.

931
01:33:09,162 --> 01:33:12,460
Have you ever seen two kids
wrestling in the yard?

932
01:33:12,531 --> 01:33:15,500
They push and tussle and maybe
they look like they're fighting...

933
01:33:15,567 --> 01:33:17,031
but they're not.

934
01:33:18,034 --> 01:33:20,399
They're really friends...

935
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:23,096
and everything's in fun.

936
01:33:23,169 --> 01:33:26,263
Then pretty soon,
they play a little too rough...

937
01:33:26,339 --> 01:33:27,772
one of 'em gets mad...

938
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:32,638
and in the end,
somebody always gets hurt.

939
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:37,302
So for you and me,
this is where somebody gets hurt.

940
01:33:37,377 --> 01:33:39,504
But when it's over...

941
01:33:39,579 --> 01:33:42,410
and however it turns out, son...

942
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,175
no hard feelings.

943
01:34:19,668 --> 01:34:21,602
Why didn't you draw?

944
01:34:23,936 --> 01:34:26,803
Why did you change your mind?
This some trick of yours?

945
01:34:28,839 --> 01:34:33,332
No, I just don't feel like it.
Maybe I ate too much.

946
01:34:35,777 --> 01:34:38,801
Perhaps some other night
you will feel like it, eh?

947
01:34:38,878 --> 01:34:41,574
Who knows?

948
01:34:41,647 --> 01:34:44,341
I never wanted it, but I've waited
and let you pick...

949
01:34:44,414 --> 01:34:46,904
your own time and place.

950
01:34:46,982 --> 01:34:49,212
You've done that tonight.

951
01:34:49,286 --> 01:34:51,877
You gonna draw,
or do I have to make you?

952
01:35:06,562 --> 01:35:08,926
Are you gonna fight...

953
01:35:08,996 --> 01:35:11,427
or do you want me
to nick your ears?

954
01:35:18,967 --> 01:35:21,435
Doc, have you gone loco?

955
01:35:35,776 --> 01:35:38,642
What's the matter with you, Billy?

956
01:35:38,711 --> 01:35:40,872
I didn't think you'd take this
off anybody.

957
01:35:40,947 --> 01:35:43,378
Maybe I wouldn't,
off anybody else.

958
01:35:43,447 --> 01:35:45,676
What do you mean by that?

959
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:51,441
Doc, don't listen to that kind of talk.
Haven't you ever seen cold feet before?

960
01:35:51,518 --> 01:35:56,180
He never had cold feet in his life.
What is it, Billy?

961
01:35:56,253 --> 01:35:59,848
I guess the idea about the cuckoo clock
wasn't so good.

962
01:35:59,923 --> 01:36:02,186
Why?

963
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:06,192
Well, it gave me time to think
and remember a few things.

964
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:09,284
You're the only partner
I ever had.

965
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:15,552
Gosh, do you really feel
that way, son?

966
01:36:18,733 --> 01:36:22,187
- I treated you worse than anyone.
- Nah, it was all my fault.

967
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:26,294
- Wouldn't want Red carrying both of us.
- Oh, don't worry.

968
01:36:26,371 --> 01:36:29,063
We can find a better way than that
to divide 'im up.

969
01:36:29,141 --> 01:36:31,128
Say, you can ride 'im outta here.

970
01:36:31,206 --> 01:36:33,797
No, I had him last.

971
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:36,169
That's right, come to think of it.

972
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:23,022
I ain't worried about you and me
ever fighting now, Billy...

973
01:37:23,101 --> 01:37:25,035
because one thing is certain.

974
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:30,029
If we didn't do it tonight,
we never will.

975
01:37:30,105 --> 01:37:32,039
Come on. Let's go.

976
01:37:37,342 --> 01:37:40,368
So long, Pat.
Don't take any wooden nickels.

977
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:49,348
You're not going with him.

978
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:52,680
Look here, you ain't gonna start
something with the two of us, are ya?

979
01:37:54,985 --> 01:37:58,181
I might've known you'd do this to me.

980
01:37:58,254 --> 01:38:01,708
Ever since you met him,
you've treated me like a dog.

981
01:38:01,789 --> 01:38:04,689
The very first day,
you sided with him against me...

982
01:38:04,758 --> 01:38:07,318
and made me the laughingstock
of the town!

983
01:38:07,392 --> 01:38:09,655
Take it easy.

984
01:38:09,727 --> 01:38:14,388
I gave you your guns
so you'd have a chance for your life.

985
01:38:14,461 --> 01:38:17,897
And now you tell me I gotta fight
the two of you to get them back.

986
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,960
You stand there, side by side...

987
01:38:22,034 --> 01:38:25,560
with that little snip of a kid
against me...

988
01:38:25,636 --> 01:38:30,593
me, the oldest and best friend
you ever had!

989
01:38:30,672 --> 01:38:35,072
And I still would be
if it wasn't for him!

990
01:38:36,574 --> 01:38:39,475
Say, mister, that's about enough
outta you for one night.

991
01:38:39,544 --> 01:38:41,979
Wait a minute.
You let me handle this.

992
01:38:42,043 --> 01:38:43,978
Pat is a friend of mine.

993
01:38:44,046 --> 01:38:48,104
I don't want to kill him, and
I don't want you to kill him. Clear?

994
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:57,349
Pat, you're just getting yourself
all steamed up.

995
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:00,582
I'll be seeing you one of these days,
and we'll have a good laugh about this.

996
01:39:00,655 --> 01:39:02,145
Now, so long.

997
01:39:07,995 --> 01:39:10,755
Be careful. You know you haven't got
a chance against me.

998
01:39:23,901 --> 01:39:25,834
Good-bye.

999
01:39:37,942 --> 01:39:41,773
- Say.
- No, son, please, don't do that.

1000
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:53,517
Oh, Doc, lie down.

1001
01:39:55,818 --> 01:39:57,752
Why not?

1002
01:39:59,021 --> 01:40:01,213
That's one thing
I've always been afraid of.

1003
01:40:01,288 --> 01:40:04,620
- What?
- Dying in bed.

1004
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:13,255
Why didn't you shoot?

1005
01:40:13,329 --> 01:40:17,160
You had me beat by a mile.
You had me cold.

1006
01:40:20,964 --> 01:40:23,728
Maybe I don't like cold meat.

1007
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:48,915
Well, go ahead.

1008
01:40:50,548 --> 01:40:52,482
Go ahead, what?

1009
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:55,312
Aren't you going to say
something over Doc?

1010
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:59,911
I don't know what to say.

1011
01:40:59,984 --> 01:41:02,886
I never said anything over anybody
I killed before.

1012
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:07,016
I think we oughta say something
over Doc.

1013
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:10,548
You better do it.

1014
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:21,130
So long, Doc.

1015
01:41:32,873 --> 01:41:34,929
I want you to know I'm sorry.

1016
01:41:37,474 --> 01:41:39,407
I honestly am.

1017
01:41:40,477 --> 01:41:42,999
Last night I was ready
to kill you...

1018
01:41:44,145 --> 01:41:47,237
but in the daylight,
I can see things much better.

1019
01:41:48,746 --> 01:41:51,909
You and Doc have been friends
for years.

1020
01:41:51,983 --> 01:41:57,282
If I hadn't come between ya,
none of this would've happened.

1021
01:41:59,921 --> 01:42:02,853
It sure is funny...

1022
01:42:02,921 --> 01:42:06,186
how two or three trails can cross...

1023
01:42:06,258 --> 01:42:09,349
and get all tangled up.

1024
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:13,394
Well, go ahead.

1025
01:42:19,932 --> 01:42:21,863
After you.

1026
01:42:21,931 --> 01:42:25,697
Say, you don't think I'd shoot you
in the back, do you?

1027
01:42:25,768 --> 01:42:29,429
I don't know,
but I ain't gonna tempt ya.

1028
01:42:29,501 --> 01:42:33,299
I don't think you'd be fool enough
to try to do it from the front.

1029
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:36,305
You never trust anybody, do you?

1030
01:42:38,642 --> 01:42:40,574
I apologize, Pat.

1031
01:42:41,643 --> 01:42:43,576
Go ahead.

1032
01:43:03,788 --> 01:43:05,720
Who's that?

1033
01:43:09,591 --> 01:43:12,561
- Where's Pat?
- He's still in the house.

1034
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:16,219
- What's he doin'?
- He's not gonna try to stop you.

1035
01:43:16,295 --> 01:43:18,729
- How do you know?
- He told me so.

1036
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:37,069
Say, Billy,
can I see you for a minute?

1037
01:43:38,808 --> 01:43:40,832
What do you want?

1038
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:45,734
If that's the way ya feel about it,
never mind.

1039
01:43:49,746 --> 01:43:53,237
At least I'm not afraid
to turn my back on you.

1040
01:43:59,819 --> 01:44:01,751
Here. Hold these a minute.

1041
01:44:53,915 --> 01:44:57,475
I thought you might like
to have Doc's guns as a keepsake.

1042
01:45:04,455 --> 01:45:07,114
Say, I sure would.

1043
01:45:07,188 --> 01:45:10,419
Thanks, Pat.
Thanks a whole lot.

1044
01:45:10,491 --> 01:45:12,958
I never had an extra pair.

1045
01:45:13,024 --> 01:45:14,958
Black holsters too.

1046
01:45:16,294 --> 01:45:19,625
They'd go nice with Sunday clothes,
if I ever get any.

1047
01:45:23,231 --> 01:45:25,422
Do you think they'll suit ya?

1048
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,987
If the barrels ain't too long.

1049
01:45:33,873 --> 01:45:35,962
No, they're just the same.

1050
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:44,973
Be careful. They're loaded.

1051
01:45:48,811 --> 01:45:50,745
That's right.

1052
01:46:03,887 --> 01:46:06,548
I think they're
better balanced than mine.

1053
01:46:08,455 --> 01:46:11,014
Then how about letting me
have yours?

1054
01:46:12,625 --> 01:46:15,319
My guns? What for?

1055
01:46:22,397 --> 01:46:24,729
If I had your guns...

1056
01:46:24,798 --> 01:46:28,562
I could say it was you out there
in that grave, instead of Doc.

1057
01:46:30,901 --> 01:46:33,129
You'd pass Doc off as me?

1058
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:35,135
Sure.

1059
01:46:36,637 --> 01:46:40,662
Everybody would believe me
once they saw your six-shooters.

1060
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:44,573
You could leave an end
to your trail right here.

1061
01:46:44,643 --> 01:46:46,904
Nobody'd follow you up north.

1062
01:46:46,976 --> 01:46:49,069
All your troubles
would be buried...

1063
01:46:49,145 --> 01:46:51,204
past and present.

1064
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:54,735
You and Rio could go off
with nothing to worry about.

1065
01:47:02,084 --> 01:47:04,576
How come you'd do a favor
like that for me?

1066
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:08,917
There you go again, Billy.

1067
01:47:08,989 --> 01:47:12,514
Distrustin' a person
who's tryin' to be decent to you.

1068
01:47:17,261 --> 01:47:21,195
Don't you realize
that's your whole trouble?

1069
01:47:21,263 --> 01:47:25,218
Don't you see that's what's gotten you
into all your fights?

1070
01:47:25,296 --> 01:47:30,233
You got more enemies than anybody
in this part of the country.

1071
01:47:30,301 --> 01:47:33,268
How do you expect to get along
with people...

1072
01:47:33,335 --> 01:47:35,963
when you think every man who holds
his hand out to you...

1073
01:47:36,037 --> 01:47:38,869
has a knife behind his back?

1074
01:47:38,938 --> 01:47:41,497
Son, l...

1075
01:47:41,573 --> 01:47:45,475
I just don't know what's going
to become of you.

1076
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:47,206
Honest, I don't.

1077
01:47:49,979 --> 01:47:52,773
I didn't mean anything.
I'm sorry.

1078
01:47:54,814 --> 01:47:57,248
That's the spirit.

1079
01:47:57,316 --> 01:47:59,250
That's my boy.

1080
01:47:59,314 --> 01:48:02,512
Now give me those guns and clear out
of here, before it's too late.

1081
01:48:13,757 --> 01:48:15,725
What's the matter?

1082
01:48:15,792 --> 01:48:18,386
Nothing.

1083
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:22,054
But I've had these guns
a long time.

1084
01:48:22,129 --> 01:48:24,459
I sure hate to let go of 'em.

1085
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:29,230
I've been pretty patient with you.

1086
01:48:32,469 --> 01:48:34,833
Billy, my son...

1087
01:48:34,902 --> 01:48:37,028
it's your duty to give them up.

1088
01:48:37,104 --> 01:48:39,299
You owe it to yourself.

1089
01:48:39,374 --> 01:48:41,703
You ought to start a new life today.

1090
01:48:41,773 --> 01:48:44,298
Those guns are the badge
of your shame.

1091
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:46,705
They represent everything
you must leave behind you.

1092
01:48:46,775 --> 01:48:49,800
Don't you realize that?
Don't you understand...

1093
01:48:49,878 --> 01:48:52,673
that if you're going to start
all over again...

1094
01:48:52,745 --> 01:48:56,375
your hands must be clean?

1095
01:49:00,983 --> 01:49:04,180
I guess you're right, Pat.

1096
01:49:04,253 --> 01:49:06,980
I never thought of it like that.

1097
01:49:15,325 --> 01:49:17,088
Thanks, Pat.

1098
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:22,094
Billy, you don't know
what this means to me.

1099
01:49:24,331 --> 01:49:26,592
You'll never forget this day.

1100
01:49:45,408 --> 01:49:47,341
Good-bye, Pat.

1101
01:49:48,443 --> 01:49:50,377
Why do you say that?

1102
01:49:50,445 --> 01:49:52,912
Why shouldn't I?

1103
01:49:52,979 --> 01:49:56,038
Why should you?
You ain't goin' anywhere.

1104
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:01,808
I took the firing pins
out of those guns.

1105
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:17,059
Why you...

1106
01:50:19,525 --> 01:50:24,257
Nothing would make me happier
than for you to keep coming.

1107
01:50:54,546 --> 01:50:56,639
Is that one of your own guns?

1108
01:50:58,515 --> 01:50:59,605
It sure looks like it.

1109
01:51:00,682 --> 01:51:02,616
How did you get it?

1110
01:51:04,187 --> 01:51:07,380
You dirty little cheat.

1111
01:51:07,453 --> 01:51:09,716
You switched those guns on me.

1112
01:51:09,788 --> 01:51:12,549
Of all the dirty, rotten tricks...

1113
01:51:12,621 --> 01:51:15,488
I didn't mean to, Pat.

1114
01:51:15,558 --> 01:51:17,924
Honest, I didn't.

1115
01:51:17,993 --> 01:51:20,390
They must've gotten mixed up
while I was playin' with 'em.

1116
01:51:41,572 --> 01:51:43,506
Thanks.

1117
01:51:47,842 --> 01:51:50,709
I left my guns right there.

1118
01:51:54,412 --> 01:51:56,573
What for?

1119
01:51:57,812 --> 01:52:02,181
Don't you have to show them to everybody
to make them believe your story?

1120
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:05,683
You see, I have an idea...

1121
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:10,119
that you'd rather give Doc the credit
for doing you up like this.

1122
01:52:10,188 --> 01:52:12,277
Because I think you'd rather be dead
than have people know...

1123
01:52:12,355 --> 01:52:14,948
that Billy the Kid did this to ya.

1124
01:52:18,857 --> 01:52:20,485
Good-bye, Pat.

1125
01:52:31,869 --> 01:52:34,527
You don't wanna go off
without your canteens, do you?

1126
01:52:34,601 --> 01:52:36,536
- Did you fill 'em up for me?
- Yes.

1127
01:52:37,305 --> 01:53:37,600
