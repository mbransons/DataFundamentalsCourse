I said, "Why should we call them miss, sir?
We know 'em."

469
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,773
Is there anyone of these
young ladies you feel...

470
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,444
does not deserve to be addressed as miss?
(CHUCKLES)

471
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,871
No, sir.
Good.

472
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,331
Next, general deportment.

473
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,375
First, the young ladies.

474
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,502
They must prove that they
are worthy and appreciative...

475
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,629
of the courtesies
we are going to show them.

476
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,882
Soon boyfriends and marriage
will concern you.

477
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,634
No man likes a slut for long.

478
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,095
Only the worst type
will marry one.

479
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:23,435
And the competition for men
on the outside is rough.

480
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,104
Next, men.

481
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,649
I've seen garbage collectors
who are cleaner.

482
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:36,406
Toughness is a quality of the mind,
like bravery, honesty and ambition.

483
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,034
If you want to wear
your hair long, clean it,

484
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,829
else you will soon
get lice and smell.

485
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,998
Soon your principal interest
will be girls.

486
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,709
You will be much more attractive
to them with clean clothes,

487
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:51,296
clean shoes, hands, face,
teeth, et cetera.

488
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,300
Now, any...
any questions?

489
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,389
Miss Pegg.
What about Mr. Weston, sir?

490
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,101
He's never tidy,
and his shoes is never brushed.

491
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,770
And his hair's a mess, isn't it?
Yeah! It's filthy!

492
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,731
(STUDENTS CHATTERING IN AGREEMENT)
Mr. Weston is not your teacher.

493
00:35:09,762 --> 00:35:10,963
We won't discuss him.

494
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,942
I'm the one to criticize if I fail to
maintain the standards I ask of you.

495
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,321
That's not fair.

496
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,871
Sir... or Mr. Thackeray.
Didn't you understand?

497
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,207
That's not fair,

498
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,209
sir.

499
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,504
I agree.
But that's just an example...

500
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,965
of the many things you'll have
to put up with when you're an adult.

501
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:38,342
You'll just have to take it.

502
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,889
Next, we are going to talk
about various...

503
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,766

Good morning.

505
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,356
I just wanted to see how you were
getting on. Fine, thank you, sir.

506
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,402

What are we gonna
talk about, sir?

Uh, last night on the telly,
Mr. Thackeray,

561
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,264
there was this, uh,
travelogue picture, you know?

562
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,268
A lot of black women
dancin' around with no tops on.

563
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,857
Don't they ever dress proper?

564
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,553
What's proper varies
throughout the world,

565
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,598
depending on customs and climate.

566
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:25,375
For their climate and according to their
customs, they were dressed properly.

567
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:28,289
Are you from South Africa, sir?
Of course not.

568
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,368
South Africans is white, isn't they?
(LAUGHTER)

569
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:35,193

South Africa, regardless of color.

00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,874

571
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,459
Yes, Ingham.

572
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:44,047
Uh, what did you mean the other
day about rebellion, sir?

573
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,883
Change. Take your hairstyles.

574
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,177
That's a form of rebellion, isn't it?

575
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,179
Aye? What, sir?

576
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,808
Don't you just do it to be different
from adults? Isn't that the reason?

577
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,935
Well, they've messed up
the world a bit, haven't they, sir?

578
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,687
You can say that again.
So you rebel.

579
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,733
Even the way you dress
is a form of rebellion, now, isn't it?

580
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,777
Oh, it's just
the new fashion, sir.

581
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,322
'Course, the adults
look proper stupid in our gear.

582
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,201
Do you think it's wrong to change,
to be different, to rebel, sir?

583
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,579
It is your duty
to change the world, if you can.

584
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:21,418
Not by violence...
peacefully, individually, not as a mob.

They started a huge social revolution.

586
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:30,427
The fashions they set in dress and
hairstyles are worldwide now.

587
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:35,765
Every new fashion
is a form of rebellion.

588
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,893
Now, there's a fine exhibition of

of risk that we've ever dared...

to take at North Quay.
I would like to try, sir.

You'd never be able
to supervise them.

613
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,762
When I took this job, you said...

614
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,848
that you wouldn't interfere as long
as I stayed within your framework.

615
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,936
Well, if you can persuade
another member of the staff...

616
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,272
to go with you,
I'll approach the council.

617
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,775
I see little hope of approval.

I was very poor.

And there was something in me
that wanted an education,

656

so I put all of my energies into that.

00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,428
Thanks.

929
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:24,142
Pamela's just finding out
she's a grown woman.

930
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:28,814
You're probably the only real
man she's ever met in her life.

931
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,983
Don't spend too much time
alone with her.

932
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,153
Why didn't you ask Gillian?

933
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,659
Oh, I thought you'd be wiser.

934
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,161
(SIGHS)

935
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,163
Well, thanks.

936

(DOOR CLOSES)

937
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,529
Well, hello, sir.

938
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,531
We can't have you
queuing up.

939
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,534
It's sir. He teaches our
Moira up at North Quay.

940
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,037
He's only got an hour for his
lunch, that's all he's got.

941
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,122
Now, what'll it be, sir?
Half a dozen oranges.

942
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,875
Oh, you'll like them.
They're lovely and juicy.

943
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,753
Here you are, guv.
Penny's wedding cake.

944
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,464
Jeanie's elder sister. She
went and got married,

945
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,216
so we thought we'd give you
a bit of cake for luck.

946
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:42,220
Jeanie Clark.
Oh! Yes. Miss Clark.

947
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,390
That was a lovely museum outing they
went on. We'll have to do it again.

948
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,809
The Museum? Oh, well,

949
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,145
we're trying to arrange
one a week.

950
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,230
Oh, that'll be lovely,
won't it, Horace?

951
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,984
The more education they learns, the better.
That's what I always say.

952
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,613
It's a proper bleeder, you know,
what with the bomb and all.

953
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,824
'Tain't the bombs. It's them
bleedin' foreigners, them Yanks.

954
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,578
Shut your gob.
My Gert's married to a Yank.

955
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,622
And a proper
nice gent he is, and all.

956
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,832
I'll thank you to keep
your opinions to yourself.

957
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,795
God Al-bloody-mighty.
Getting technical, eh?

958
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,255
Listen, first cast the mote
out of your own bleedin' eye...

959
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,257
before you cast the bomb out of mine.
Aw, shut up.

960
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,259
He's a proper faggot.
Here you are.

961
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,261
You'll like them, sir.
Thank you.

962
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,597
Thank you. Who's next?
Come on, girls.

963
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,599
Speak up.

964
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,105
Gillian?
Uh-huh?

965
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:37,109
I was wondering if you would also give
the girls some lessons in makeup.

966
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,614
I think quite a few
of them would be, uh,

967
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,701
very pretty
if they knew how to do it.

968
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,744
Well, certainly.

969
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,794
You really are getting
involved with your children,

970
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,088
aren't you?
No, I'm just trying to help.

971
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,048
That's the job, isn't it?

972
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,134
You want some of this?
No, thanks.

973
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,970
Is that all you're
having for lunch? Yep.

974
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:10,559
You on a diet? No. I'll
tell you... I'm a weak man.

975
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,811
At the moment, a little skint.

976
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,813
When I eat, (SLURPS)
do I love to eat.

977
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:18,483
(LAUGHS) And I love wine, but
I just can't have a glass.

978
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,569
I want to drink
the whole bottle.

979
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,405
So I avoid wine
and pastrami sandwiches...

980
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,490
and baked potatoes...

981
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,161
with butter and bacon...

982
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,872
and strawberry shortcake
and cheesecake.

983
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,874
(LAUGHING)

984
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,421
But I like to eat light,
uh, for lunch.

985
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,634
How is it
with the Dare girl?

986
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,432
No problems.

987
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:55,103
Are you going to stay on here, Mark?
Until I get sorted out.

988
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,147
No luck with the job?

989
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,191
But I'm plugging away.

990
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,905
Remember a few weeks ago, when you
thought you'd lost the battle?

991
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:10,660
I thought you had too. There's a good
angel looking after me somewhere.

992
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,875
Come on.
Sort yourselves out.

993
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,879
Go on. Hurry up.

994
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,883
All right, go.

995
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,052
Come on, Denham.
Hurry it up.

996
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,059
Land on your toes.
Do it again. Next.

997
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,854
Next!

998
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:43,568
Next! Buckley!

999
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,570
Come on, boy.
I'm not a boy.

1000
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,405
I'm a man, and I don't want
to do it, sir.

1001
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,033
It's too high.
You're a boy, and you're a fat boy too.

1002
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,577
Come on. I'm waiting.
Get some of that jelly off of you.

1003
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,788
Fats can't do it.
It's too high for him.

1004
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,790
'Course he can't do it.

1005
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,336
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it, boy.

1006
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,630
I'm not a boy.
Shut up!

1007
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,802
Buckley, do as you're told.

1008
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,639
Come on.

1009
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:24,109

(BUCKLEY MOANING)
Is he all right, Bert?

1013
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,249
(MOANING)
I don't know.

1014
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,340
You bloody bastard.

1015
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,885
Put that down, Potter! You
knew Fats couldn't do that.

1016
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,887
You've always
had it in for him.

1017
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,889
Potter, put that down.

1018
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,854
Quick, sir! They're
fighting in the gym, sir!

1019
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,483
Go on, Potts!

1020
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,530
For the last time, put it down!
That weren't no accident!

1021
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,532
Potter!

1022
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,661
I'll take that.

1023
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,668
Go and help Buckley.
Go on.

1024
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,842
Potts should have done the
bastard like he did Fats.

1025
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,191
You all right, boy?
Yes, thank you, sir.

1026
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,193
Me stomach doesn't
half hurt though.

1027
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:51,029
Jackson, Ingham,
help him up to Mrs. Evans.

1028
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,453
All right.

1029
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,538
What happened?

1030
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:04,084
(SIGHS)
Hmm?

1031
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,846
Buckley's all right.

1032
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,225
More frightened
than anything else.

1033
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,562
Why'd you make him
do that jump?

1034
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,565
He just stood there
and refused to obey.

1035
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,237
When he jumped, well, he sent the
buck flying and I couldn't catch him.

1036
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,239
Oh.

1037
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:37,575
Thanks for helping me out.

(SIGHS)

1039
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,749
I understand
that Buckley is a...

1040
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,751
pet whipping boy of yours.

1041
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,753
Is that right?

1042
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:52,757
I'd better report it to the head.
There's gonna be the devil to pay.

1043
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,981
(CHATTERING)

1044
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:27,167
Potter? I can't think of anything
that could excuse your behavior.

1045
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:30,295
But it was him, sir!
He made Fats do it!

1046
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:34,007
Fats said he couldn't do it! The bloody
bully has always had it in for him!

1047
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:36,801
I'm not concerned with
Mr. Bell's behavior, but yours.

1048
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,554
Suppose instead of a piece of wood, a
gun or a knife had been handy, eh?

1049
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:42,307
What then? Potter was narked.
We was all narked.

1050
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,434
That bleeder was in the wrong,
and you bloody well know it.

1051
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:47,312
You're missing the point, Denham.
You all are.

1052
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,731
In a few weeks you will
be going out into the world.

1053
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,400
Are you going to use a weapon every
time someone makes you angry?

1054
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,820
You're supposed to be learning
self-discipline here.

1055
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,865
Potter, you owe Mr. Bell
an apology.

1056
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:01,659
Huh? No (ALL SHOUTING)

1057
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:05,830
Why should he apologize? Just 'cause
Bell's a bleedin' teacher, eh?

1058
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,999
You'd better
answer that, Potter.

1059
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,543
Do you think you behaved
like a... like an adult?

1060
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,766
How about Bell apologizing
to Buckley, eh?

1061
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,812
My business is with you,
not Mr. Bell.

1062
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,772
It's easy for you
to talk.

1063
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:33,274
No one pushes you around.

1064
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,693
Well, Potter?

1065
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,404
Are you a man or a hoodlum?

1066
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,369
Do it, Potts. Do it? Denham!

1067
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,371
(ALL TALKING)

1068
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,373
Bell will put you up before the
law if you don't, won't he?

1069
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,376
And you've got to have
recommends for a job, ain't you?

1070
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,628
He's got to sign one,
hasn't he?

1071
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:57,549
This has nothing to do
with what I sign or won't sign.

1072
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,884
There's never been
a teacher you could trust.

1073
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,804
We're only safe together... against them.
Like it's always been.

1074
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:06,224
But sir's different! If he
says Potts is... That he is.

1075
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,017
And he's wrong now.

1076
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,105
You all know Bell's been
after old Fats for years.

1077
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,736
Go on, Potts.

1078
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,249
If you apologize

Why should you do that,

Wouldn't that make you
