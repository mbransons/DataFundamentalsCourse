1
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,632
Annie!

2
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,719
Annie!

3
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,679
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

4
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,638
There, there.

5
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,597
It was only a dream, Molly.
It's all right.

6
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,149
How am I supposed to get any sleep?

7
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,836
It was only a dream.
Everything's all right.

8
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,435
Molly shouldn't be in this room.

9
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,759
She's a baby.
She cries all the time.

10
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,433
She wets the bed.

11
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,268
I do not!

12
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,034
You're the one who shouldn't
be in here!

13
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,437
Brat, stop!
We're gonna get in trouble.

14
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,829
Go, Duffy! Go!

15
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,231
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

16
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,638
Cut it out!

17
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,829
I mean it! Do you want
Miss Hannigan to come in?

18
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,435
Go back to bed.

19
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,037
Now. Or you'll have me to deal with.

20
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,073
Blow it out of your old wazoo.

21
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,438
Close your eyes.
Think about your folks.

22
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,870
You're the only one who has folks.

23
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,749
Mine are dead.

24
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,156
Think about the folks who
want to adopt you...

25
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,439
...because they want a little girl with
brown hair and brown eyes.

26
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,078
Oh, my goodness.

27
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,235
Did I hear singing in here?

28
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,839
All right. Fine.

29
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,429
Since we're all so wide awake!

30
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,153
Get up! Get out of bed!

31
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,155
Clean up this mess!
Get dressed!

32
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,791
This room had better be regulation
before breakfast...

33
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,953
...my little pig droppings.
Or kill, kill, kill!

34
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,519
It's in the middle of the night.

35
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,633
"It's in the middle of the night."

36
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,275
If this floor don't shine like
the top of the Chrysler Building...

37
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,080
...your backsides will.

38
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,275
Understand?

39
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,637
Yes, Miss Hannigan.

40
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,954
- What do we say, Annie?
- I love you, Miss Hannigan.

41
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,829
Why any kid would want to be
an orphan is beyond me.

42
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,875
You'll stay up till
this dump...

43
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,039
...shines like the top of
the Chrysler Building.

44
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,831
Kill, kill.

45
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,036
Little pig droppings.

46
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,039
Rotten orphans.

47
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,436
Nobody loves you.

48
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,835
I love you, Miss Hannigan.

49
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,832
Get to work!

50
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,636
Strip that bed!

51
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,636
Scrub that floor!

52
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,429
Polish my shoes!

53
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,438
And I mean...

54
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,955
...start now!

55
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,954
We gotta get out of here
or we'll get killed.

56
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,873
- Cover me up good.
- All you ever do is run away.

57
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,111
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

58
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,878
She'll put you in the cellar.

59
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,271
- You'll get whipped again.
- You're gonna get us in trouble.

60
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,839
Molly, shut up!

61
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,636
- I'm gonna tell.
- And I'm gonna rearrange your teeth!

62
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,635
Stomp on her foot!

63
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,150
What are you all
just standing around here for?

64
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,073
You're supposed to clean
the bathroom and the kitchen...

65
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,039
...before lunch, my little
pig droppings.

66
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,233
And if you skip the corners,
there will be no lunch.

67
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,429
And we're not having hot mush today.

68
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,236
We're having cold mush.

69
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,678
- What?
- We love you, Miss Hannigan.

70
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,433
Wonderful.

71
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,676
Where's Annie?

72
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,077
- She had to go bathroom.
- "She had to go bathroom."

73
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,436
Miss Hannigan.

74
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,832
Mr. Bundles.

75
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,469
It's time for a tumble
with a bundle.

76
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,280
Not today. I'm behind...

77
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,630
My schedule, I mean.

78
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,879
What are schedules in the storms
of passion, Mr. Bundles?

79
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,271
Just so much flotsam and jetsam.

80
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,033
Miss Hannigan, please!

81
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,314
- What are you doing out here?
- Helping you.

82
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,836
- It's heavy today.
- It's a lot heavier than usual.

83
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,637
- It shouldn't be. What's in there?
- Miss Hannigan...

84
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,271
You're my kind of woman.

85
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,236
Till next month, Miss Hannigan.

86
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,278
I'll be right here.

87
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,511
Mr. Bundles, I'm in here.

88
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,237
- Thank you, Mr. Bundles.
- Good luck.

89
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,236
Get his taiI!

90
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,995
Poor dog.

91
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,273
Leave him alone.
What's he ever done to you?

92
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,031
Amscray!

93
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,834
All right, who's next?

94
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,879
Anybody else?

95
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,838
- Scram, man!
- Let's go!

96
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,235
Then get lost.

97
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,878
Shake a leg! Come on!

98
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,036
Hey, you're all right.

99
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,635
I did nothing any decent person
wouldn't have done.

100
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,438
Dumb dog.

101
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,031
Mister, that's my dog.

102
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,277
Yeah? Where's his licence?
Where's his leash?

103
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,034
He's no more your dog
than I am your father.

104
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,151
I left his licence at home.

105
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,194
Please don't take him to the pound.
My father's blind.

106
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,269
This dog leads him to work.
If he doesn't work, we'll starve.

107
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,833
What's his name?

108
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,430
My father's name?

109
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,270
- The dog's name.
- Oh, the dog's name!

110
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,317
His name's Sandy.

111
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,834
That's it. Sandy.

112
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,837
Call him.

113
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,838
Call him?

114
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,638
Go over there and call him.

115
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,479
You mean by his name?

116
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,672
By his name. The dog's name.

117
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,750
Sandy! Come here, Sandy.

118
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,238
Sandy!

119
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,556
Come here, Rover. Come here, boy.

120
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,473
Rin Tin Tin! Come to Daddy.

121
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,515
- Sandy, come here.
- Rin Tin Tin, come here.

122
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,870
Sandy!

123
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,634
Come here, Sandy. Come here, Sandy.
Come here.

124
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,432
Good old Sandy!

125
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,798
You've got yourself a dog.
Get him a collar and a leash.

126
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,632
Yes, sir.

127
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,351
Miss Hannigan! Miss Hannigan!

128
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,039
What?!

129
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,836
Annie!

130
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,032
Look what I found
under a paving stone.

131
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,072
Annie, my little peach fuzz,
are you all right?

132
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,472
- I was worried sick.
- I knew you would be.

133
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,154
A big-hearted woman like you.

134
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,072
How can I ever thank you...

135
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,675
...enough?

136
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,549
I'm sure we can think of something
if we get our heads together.

137
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,870
Kissy, kissy, kissy.

138
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,714
Kill! Kill!

139
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,949
- We love you, Miss Hannigan.
- Sure.

140
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,990
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

141
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,628
He smells.

142
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,638
- What's his name?
- Guess.

143
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,116
Fifi?

144
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,429
That ain't a name for this mutt.

145
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,234
Rover.

146
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,232
She's coming. She's coming.

147
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,233
Hide him.

148
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,237
I love you, Miss Hannigan.

149
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,031
And you will love the paddle closet.

150
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,278
And this...

151
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,314
...will love the sausage factory.

152
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,830
- No, Miss...
- What?

153
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,469
We love you, Miss Hannigan.

154
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,749
Shut up.

155
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,230
All right! All right!

156
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,996
Yeah?

157
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,870
Miss Hannigan, I'm Grace Farrell.

158
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,839
The New York Board of Orphans
sent me.

159
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,038
My goodness, won't you come in?

160
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,435
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

161
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,553
Welcome.
Welcome to our happy home.

162
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,836
- Thank you.
- Ladies.

163
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,835
- What did you say your name was?
- Grace Farrell.

164
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,878
Grace. Aptly named.

165
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,634
I'm here to enquire about an orphan.

166
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,636
Grace, I can explain the whole thing.
What happened was...

167
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,470
...the child bribed Mr. Bundles
to smuggle her out of here.

168
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,871
I should've called Mr. Donnatelli, but
the truth is...

169
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,638
...I called the cops instead.

170
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,429
Anyway she's back, everything's fine.
All's well that ends well.

171
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,478
No harm, no foul,
my little scissors legs?

172
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,673
What are you talking about?

173
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,915
Are you pedalling beauty products?
I don't need beauty products.

174
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,237
If that's what you're doing,
pedal yourself right out of here.

175
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,638
I am the private secretary
to Oliver Warbucks.

176
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,910
The Oliver Warbucks?

177
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,677
- Oliver Warbucks the millionaire?
- No, the billionaire.

178
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,558
Mary, mother of God.

179
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,231
Mr. Warbucks would like to invite
an orphan to spend a week with him.

180
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,274
I'm here to select one.

181
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,556
That's just wonderful.

182
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,075
What kind of orphan did he
have in mind?

183
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,634
Friendly.

184
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,350
Intelligent.

185
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,679
M-l-S-S-l-S-S-l-P-P-I.

186
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,629
And happy.

187
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,795
How old?

188
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,718
Age doesn't really matter.

189
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,833
Seven.

190
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,112
Eight. Nine.

191
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,716
Ten?

192
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,751
Yes, 10 is just fine.

193
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,149
Ten?

194
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,749
I'm sorry, I almost forgot.

195
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,551
- Mr. Warbucks prefers red hair.
- A 10-year-old redhead?

196
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,109
Sorry, I ain't got it.

197
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,550
What about this child?

198
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,030
- Annie?
- Yes.

199
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,272
You don't want Annie.

200
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,192
Why not?

201
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,471
She's... She's a drunk.

202
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,877
Fiddle-faddle.

203
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,476
How would you like to spend
a week with Mr. Warbucks?

204
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,953
Oh, boy! I would love to.
I would really, really love to.

205
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,714
Wait! Slow down!
Hold on there!

206
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,637
You can have any orphan in the whole
orphanage except Annie.

207
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,790
Why?

208
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,312
She's got it coming to her,
and I don't mean a week of luxury.

209
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,438
- She's got to learn to know her place.
- Her place?

210
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,238
Annie is entirely too cheeky.

211
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,315
- Mr. Warbucks likes cheeky orphans.
- Tough!

212
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,318
I assume you work for Mr. Donnatelli
and the Board of New York Orphans.

213
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,471
Don't assume nothing, sweetheart.

214
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,477
Mr. Warbucks knows Mr. Donnatelli.

215
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,517
- Is that a fact?
- Yes it is.

216
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,475
It's also a fact that he said how many
people he had lined up for your job.

217
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,353
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

218
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,077
It's awful to be out of work,
isn't it, Miss Hannigan?

219
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,319
Just terrible.

220
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,033
Leaping lizards!

221
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,193
- Leaping lizards!
- The limousine is waiting.

222
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,149
- My dog.
- What?

223
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,036
Here, Sandy. Come here.

224
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,629
He's really nice. Really good.

225
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,434
He never jumps up on people.

226
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,035
He's a very sweet dog, but really,
I don't think Mr. Warbucks...

227
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,753
Then I'm not coming.

228
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,440
She's going to send him to
the sausage factory.

229
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,917
- She said so herself.
- I'm not zoned for dogs.

230
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,829
- We'll take the dog.
- Oh, boy!

231
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,879
Bye, Annie!

232
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,631
I'll be back.
I'll bring everybody presents.

233
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,157
Bye, Molly. See you soon.
Bye, Pepper. Bye, Duffy.

234
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,030
Is this a train station?
Are we going on a train?

235
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,879
No, this is Mr. Warbucks' house.

236
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,712
Leaping lizards.

237
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,554
Wow!

238
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,112
This is Punjab. He and the Asp
are Mr. Warbucks' bodyguards.

239
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,589
Come along. Let's get you settled.

240
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,672
Been to the zoo, Miss Farrell?

241
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,069
Not recently, Drake.

242
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,390
Has the organ been tuned?

243
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,875
Pool heated? Tennis net up?

244
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,553
French doors fixed?

245
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,314
Elevator oiled?
Typewriter repaired?

246
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,152
Second teletype installed?

247
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,029
- Are you allergic to dogs, Drake?
- No, filth.

248
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,589
- Is dinner under way, Mrs. Pugh?
- Yes, miss.

249
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,875
I'm preparing his favourite.

250
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,758
Texas grapefruit, Virginia ham...

251
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,835
...ldaho potatoes, Wisconsin cheese,
Washington apples and baked Alaska.

252
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,800
I have an announcement to make.

253
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,828
This is Annie, and she'll
be staying with us for a week.

254
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,152
This is her dog, Sandy.

255
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,430
He'll be staying with me.

256
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,671
May I take your sweater, miss?

257
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,031
- Will I get it back?
- Of course, miss!

258
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,398
What would you like to do first?

259
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,230
The windows, then the floors,
that way if I drip...

260
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,237
You don't understand. You don't
have to do any cleaning here.

261
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,555
I won't?

262
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,711
How am I gonna earn my keep?

263
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,791
You're our guest, Annie.

264
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,394
Hey, Annie!

265
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,830
Got something for you.

266
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,037
Here you are, Annie.

267
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,838
It's Mr. Warbucks. Don't worry now.

268
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,195
- Welcome home, sir.
- Did the painting arrive?

269
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,914
They're just uncrating it, sir.

270
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,560
I don't like it. Send it back.
Any messages?

271
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,429
President Roosevelt called three
times. He said it was urgent.

272
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,955
Everything's urgent to a Democrat.
What else?

273
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,909
Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Vanderbilt,
Mr. Du Pont, Mr. Carnegie.

274
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,119
Wait! There's something interesting
in that woman's smile.

275
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,108
I might learn to like her.
Hang her in my bathroom.

276
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,989
No time for dinner tonight. Send out
for an American cheese sandwich.

277
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,270
Come, let's get started.

278
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,477
What the deviI's going on here?

279
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,429
This is the press representative.
Your image.

280
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,438
Oh, yes.

281
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,839
Pick him up, Punjab.
Get him another camera.

282
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,230
Why do I smell wet dog?

283
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,629
Because we gave Sandy a bath.

284
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,233
What's this?

285
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,671
This is Annie, the orphan
that'll be staying with us.

286
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,353
What are you talking about?

287
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,310
The photo of you sharing your home
with an orphan? Only for a week.

288
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,791
This doesn't look like a boy!
Orphans are boys.

289
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,271
You didn't say you wanted a boy. You
just said an orphan, so I got a girl.

290
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,674
I want a boy!

291
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,079
I've got an interesting
smile too, sir.

292
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,235
Couldn't you learn to like me, sir?
Hang me in the bathroom?

293
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,349
- Take them back now.
- Sir, she just got here.

294
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,433
That's okay, Miss Farrell.
We'll be okay.

295
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,516
It was nice meeting you anyhow.
I sure do like your place.

296
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,673
- Thank you, Annette.
- Annie. I've had a swell time.

297
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,435
The Asp drove us here in
a car the size of a train.

298
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,716
And Punjab put a spell on Sandy.

299
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,352
We made Drake sneeze.
And I played your pipe organ.

300
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,438
Sandy got a bubble bath.

301
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,558
I've had enough fun
to last me for years.

302
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,951
It's a really swell idea
to have an orphan for a week.

303
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,835
A really terrific idea.

304
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,636
Even if it is only for your image,
I'm glad you're doing it.

305
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,831
I'm glad you approve.

306
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,632
Let's get to work!

307
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,872
Are you sure you need a boy?
Couldn't she stay?

308
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,157
Whatever, but just for the week.

309
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,070
- You know what?
- What?

310
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,437
- I love you.
- I know.

311
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,912
- Kiss me as only you can.
- You deviI.

312
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,236
Get away!

313
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,034
- Rooster!
- Sis.

314
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,595
You're supposed to be in jaiI.

315
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,314
- They let me out early.
- For good behaviour.

316
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,718
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Lily St. Regis.

317
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,748
- Named from the hotel.
- Room service.

318
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,755
This afternoon I put 10 on the nose
of a beautiful horse at 8-1.

319
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,912
Sure enough, the scum-bum
took off and whipped the pack.

320
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,275
No kidding?

321
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,435
The thing is, I got delayed
and I didn't have time to cash in.

322
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,879
Sis, first thing in the morning,
guaranteed.

323
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,874
All I need is 5 to tide me over.

324
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,439
Not even a nickel for the subway.

325
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,029
Come on, Sis.

326
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,995
I bet Miss Sticky-fingers here
can loan you a lousy 5 bucks.

327
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,436
I beg your pardon, I'm sure.

328
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,878
But I don't stoop to what you're
incinerating.

329
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,035
Give me back my goods, toots.

330
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,478
Okay, Rooster.

331
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,037
If I loan you 5 bucks, will you
take this dumb hotel out of here?

332
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,196
I'm sorry, Sis. Lily.

333
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,873
Not even a nickel for the subway.

334
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,629
You and her have the same mother?

335
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,476
Rooster!

336
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,832
This room's bigger than Grant's tomb.

337
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,633
Me too.

338
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,835
Come on, Sandy. Come on!

339
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,075
In conclusion...

340
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,035
...because your country has raised its
voice loud and clear for democracy...

341
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,238
...I will extend to you, a credit line...

342
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,908
...for 35 of my new fighter-bombers.

343
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,871
That will come with a year's supply
of spare parts and ammunition...

344
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,269
What's this?

345
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,029
Sandy's not used to sleeping
by himself. He gets lonesome.

346
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,835
Where were we?

347
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,268
- "Ammunition," sir.
- Are you getting a lot done?

348
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,756
I'd get a lot more done
if certain people...

349
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,873
If Franklin Delano Roosevelt
would leave me alone.

350
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,678
Six calls since I got home.

351
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,316
- What's he want?
- My support for the New Deal.

352
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,233
He is our president, sir.

353
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,073
Punjab!

354
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,832
Remove this animal and its young
mistress along with it.

355
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,150
Dear Richie, this letter will serve
as confirmation of correspondence...

356
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,990
...concerning the details
of your extended deferment.

357
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,993
- On or before September first.

358
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,075
If you cannot meet that deadline,
you will be charged interest.

359
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,312
Six percent. Cordially, et cetera.

360
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,115
P.S. One of my companies
is developing bomb-proof glass.

361
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,395
This may be of interest to you
if the global situation deteriorates.

362
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,431
- What was that?
- Well done, Sandy.

363
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,712
- Was that man trying to kill you?
- That will be all.

364
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,076
Yes, sir. Come along, dear.

365
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,873
- Who'd want to kill Mr. Warbucks?
- The Bolsheviks.

366
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,475
He's proof that
the American system works...

367
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,035
...and the Bolsheviks don't
want anyone to know.

368
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,557
The Bolsheviks? Leaping lizards!

369
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,715
- Get your dog out of my pool!
- He thought you were drowning.

370
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,832
- Go on, you mutt. Get out of here.
- Come on.

371
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,798
Do you like my suit?

372
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,473
What? Oh, yes.

373
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,238
Miss Farrell picked it out.

374
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,956
- It's hard getting used to a girl.
- Girls are easy to get used to.

375
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,159
Like Miss Farrell,
she does all the work around here.

376
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,631
- You don't know her first name.
- I do. It's Grace.

377
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,435
She thinks you're the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

378
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,635
I beg your pardon.

379
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,038
I know it's none of my business,
but you never notice anything.

380
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,831
Sliced bread.

381
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,435
Wilhelm, please offer your son my
congratulations on his engagement.

382
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,668
Hold on. Buy copper.

383
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,835
Tell the crown prince
that my yacht in Monte Carlo...

384
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,835
...is entirely at his disposal.

385
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,430
Hold on. More copper.

386
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,269
- Don't encourage her, Punjab.
- Maybe I should take her out.

387
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,435
- Where do you want to go?
- To meet President Roosevelt.

388
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,315
- How about a movie?
- Pepper went to a movie once.

389
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,593
She said it was swell,
and Miss Hannigan goes all the time.

390
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,833
- Take her to the movies.
- Aren't you going to take me?

391
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,755
Me? Annie, you may think
that Miss Farrell does all the work...

392
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,629
...but I'm a very busy man.

393
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,633
I know. I didn't mean
to get in the way, Mr. Warbucks.

394
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,628
Nobody has to take me.
I'll go practice my backhand.

395
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,315
Pepper lies a lot. She probably
hasn't been to a movie either.

396
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,919
Actually, I think it's better when
you don't know what you're missing.

397
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,235
Punjab, buy out the 8:00
show. Let's all go to the movies.

398
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:35,275
- You should leave your hair down.
- No, I couldn't.

399
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,509
Miss Hannigan says
a man don't look at your brains.

400
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,313
Come on, let's go to the movies.

401
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,915
Let's go see the stars.

402
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,268
For the "lady of the camellias."

403
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,315
- They're twice as large as usual.
- I'll have twice as many as usual.

404
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,878
Twice as many?
I know what those things cost.

405
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,557
Don't listen to her.
They're an investment.

406
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,357
You won't be young forever.
It's time you settled your future.

407
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,351
I know the very man for you.

408
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,272
- Really?
- Yes, really.

409
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,876
- No one loves you as much as I.
- True, but what can I do about it?

410
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,911
You should go away
and not see me anymore.

411
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,915
Don't go in anger. Laugh at yourself
a little, as I laugh at myself.

412
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,995
Come and talk to me once in a while
in a friendly way.

413
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,038
That's too much and not enough.

414
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,953
Believe in love, Marguerite.

415
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,316
Then you do love him.

416
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,709
Dare to tell me that you love him,
and you're free of me forever.

417
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,313
I love him.

418
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,758
Come in here, all of you.
See this woman? You know her.

419
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,710
Listen to what I'm going to say.
I thought she loved me.

420
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,875
I let her make sacrifices for me,
but I owe her nothing.

421
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,838
Go on, take it.

422
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,834
Buy camellias. Buy diamonds.
Buy carriages. Buy a grave.

423
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,715
You know how to treat a woman
as she deserves.

424
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,318
Marguerite.

425
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,913
Oh, it's you.

426
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,557
I've been down in the street
half the night...

427
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,237
...wanting to come up,
but not daring to. I felt so guilty.

428
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,950
Even if we can't
go to the country today...

429
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,716
...think of how happy we were once
and how happy we'll be again.

430
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,919
Think of the day you found
the four-leaf clover.

431
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,955
Think of the vows that
we're going to make to each other.

432
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,109
This is for life, Marguerite.

433
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,508
Marguerite.

434
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,313
Marguerite.

435
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,914
No, don't leave me.
Marguerite, come back.

436
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,551
Could you get her nightgown?
It's behind the bathroom door.

437
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,109
Certainly.

438
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,432
- Miss Farrell.
- It's all right.

439
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,956
- How did you learn that?
- Learn what?

440
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,872
- That.
- What?

441
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,753
- You put her to bed.
- You put her to bed too.

442
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,752
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

443
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,911
Good heavens.

444
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,515
- That was a wonderful evening.
- I have to close a factory.

445
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,949
- About Annie.
- What about Annie?

446
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,118
Could we keep her?

447
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,116
That horrible orphanage,
I can't bear to send her back there.

448
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,755
Get ahold of yourself.
What's come over you?

449
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,039
I'd take care of her.
You have plenty of room here.

450
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,195
- We could take her on as your ward.
- Absolutely not.

451
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,312
I love money, I love power.

452
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,711
I do not now,
nor ever will, love children.

453
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,319
Watching you with her last night
I thought maybe...

454
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,909
Yes?

455
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,549
- I've just noticed something.
- Yes?

456
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,110
You're awfully pretty
when you argue with me.

457
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,115
- Thank you, sir.
- Oliver.

458
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,510
Do you just love money and power
and capitalism?

459
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,109
They'll never love you back.

460
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,511
- Your teeth are crooked.
- I'll have them fixed.

461
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,675
- I like them crooked.
- I'll leave them.

462
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,719
Thank you.

463
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,719
I could have the papers signed
this morning.

464
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:23,035
- It means a great deal to you.
- Yes, a great deal.

465
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,116
I'll do it myself.

466
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,911
I could just kiss you!

467
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,193
Grace, get her a little gift.

468
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,919
That's a good idea.

469
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,077
Get her a new locket.

470
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,038
Be careful at that orphanage.
That woman's got claws and fangs.

471
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,559
- We got Annie?
- Yeah.

472
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:09,110
It's a hard-knock life for us.

473
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,911
It's a hard-knock life for us.

474
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,597
No one cares for you a smidge...

475
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,037
...when you're in an orphanage.

476
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,075
What are you doing?

477
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,072
Why aren't you marching in line
with the rest of them?

478
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:41,389
Duffy, come here. Come on.

479
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,635
You're hiding something
from Miss Hannigan behind your back.

480
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:54,079
- No.
- Let me have it.

481
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,076
Get inside!

482
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,875
I've seen his picture in the paper
with President Roosevelt.

483
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,352
- Hannigan, I presume?
- Yes.

484
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,074
I want to talk to you about Annie.

485
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,271
You want to return her and trade up?

486
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,671
I want to adopt her.

487
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,675
Would you excuse me for a moment?

488
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,272
- Please step into my office.
- Thank you.

489
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,874
Hi, sweetie.

490
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,271
Little cutie.

491
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,072
This way.

492
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,479
- Welcome.
- Miss Hannigan...

493
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:17,595
Mr. Warbucks, for a Republican,
you are sinfully handsome.

494
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,670
I go absolutely weak in the knees
over men like you.

495
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:28,317
- My God, is that thing real?
- Just sign the papers.

496
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,552
Would you like to see the bedroom,
my billiard ball?

497
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,270
Sign.

498
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,990
- I make a very dry martini.
- Right here.

499
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,552
- I make a very wet soufflé.
- Just your name.

500
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:47,715
- Don't be such an old meanie.
- Come, my dear.

501
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,953
- I have an appointment at 1.
- This way.

502
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,118
Women! Does it take this long
to get to Tiffany's and back?

503
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,477
- I hear the car.
- It's probably not the right car.

504
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,276
- It's the Duesenberg.
- What took you so long?

505
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,038
What's happening here?

506
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:14,119
- Where's Annie?
- She's taking her karate lesson.

507
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,511
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not. You give it to her.

508
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,877
- It was your idea.
- She likes you more than me.

509
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,112
Oliver, will you pull
yourself together!

510
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,873
Want to see
what the Asp taught me today?

511
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,079
To the couch, Punjab, if you please.

512
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,795
- I didn't think it would work.
- Now you know it does.

513
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,238
- Shall I call a doctor?
- It'll be fine.

514
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,159
Thank you.

515
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,676
We'll leave you two alone.

516
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,549
I want to talk to you
about something very serious.

517
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,708
- You don't want me anymore.
- On the contrary, I do.

518
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,634
Good Lord!

519
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,876
- Can we have a man-to-man talk?
- Sure.

520
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,558
What I'm proposing
would involve a long-term agreement.

521
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,474
Maybe you ought to know more about
me before you make up your mind.

522
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,879
- Okay.
- Let's go for a walk.

523
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,797
I was born in Liverpool.

524
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:57,275
My brother died of pneumonia because
we didn't have money for medicine.

525
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,396
I decided then and there
that one day I would be very rich.

526
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:07,792
- Good idea.
- America was a land of opportunity.

527
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,271
I signed on a ship as cabin boy.

528
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,308
By the time I was 21,
I'd made my first million.

529
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,677
In the next 10 years,
I turned that into 100 million.

530
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:23,836
In those days that was a lot
of money. I was ruthless.

531
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,475
Making money was all I ever
gave a damn about, up till now.

532
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,477
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

533
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,069
It has occurred to me that no matter
how much money I have...

534
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:47,675
...unless I have someone to share it
with, I might as well be broke.

535
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,999
- You know what I'm trying to say?
- Sure.

536
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,315
Kind of.

537
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,671
- Kind of?
- I guess not.

538
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,552
- You've given me so much already.
- I have the papers. It's official.

539
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,473
What is?

540
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,479
- Let me put it on you.
- No.

541
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:28,075
It's a swell locket, but if it's
all the same, I'll keep my old one.

542
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,518
It isn't all the same.
I've had this one engraved.

543
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:37,151
"To Annie,
With love from Daddy Warbucks."

544
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,398
When my folks left me
at the orphanage 10 years ago...

545
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,509
...they left a note saying
they'd come back to get me.

546
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,197
They kept the other half
of this old locket so I'd know them.

547
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,399
I'm going to find them someday and
have a regular mother and father...

548
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,713
...like a regular kid. I am.

549
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:06,995
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.
You've been nicer to me than anyone.

550
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,911
But I've been dreaming of my folks
for as long as I can remember.

551
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,072
I've just got to find them.

552
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,076
And I'll help you.

553
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:29,635
Grace, get me J. Edgar on the phone!

554
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,519
Drake, get me the chief of police!

555
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,275
Asp, get me Walter Winchell!

556
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:41,395
Punjab, get me
William Randolph Hearst!

557
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,869
And, Saunders, get me a drink!

558
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,876
Six, seven, eight, you're on.

559
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,995
L-O-D-E-N-T
lodent

560
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,278
The lovely Boylan Sisters.

561
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:50,595
Tonight as a special treat
from yours truly, Bert Healy...

562
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:55,870
...l'd like to introduce
a little orphan named Annie.

563
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,675
Who's that who just walked into
our Red Network studios?

564
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,709
It's none other than the
Wall Street tycoon, Oliver Warbucks!

565
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:23,595
Thank you, Bert Healy.
It's swell... Do I say swell?

566
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,519
Swell to be on the lodent Hour.

567
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,071
You're searching
for Annie's parents.

568
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:34,193
I told you that
before we went on the air. Oh, yes!

569
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:38,877
"I am conducting
a coast-to-coast search...

570
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:43,949
...for Annie's parents. Drop page.
Warbucks continues."

571
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:49,115
I am offering a cash reward
to Annie's parents of $50, 000.

572
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,916
Mr. Warbucks!

573
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:57,073
Oh, boy! 50,000 smackers.

574
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,074
Annie's parents, if you're listening,
contact Oliver Warbucks...

575
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,872
"Warbucks interrupts.

576
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:08,035
At my house, 987, Fifth Avenue,
New York City.

577
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,515
Thank you, Bert Healy,
and thank you, all-new lodent.

578
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:19,470
The toothpaste with miracle K-64
to fight hali..."

579
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,076
- Halitosis.
- "Thank you for your time.

580
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:28,235
Good night, Bert Healy,
for the Red Network. Drop page."

581
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,557
Did I just do a commercial?
Let's get out of here.

582
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,476
I've never endorsed a product
in all of my career.

583
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,359
From all of you, our smiles family,
this is Bert Healy saying...

584
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:36,069
The lovely Boylan Sisters.

585
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,516
Do I hear happiness in here?

586
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,518
They never miss.

587
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,470
Everybody's
going to get their chance.

588
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,274
Annie, it's your mother.

589
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,835
- We've got to get her out of here.
- Get the autocopter ready.

590
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,078
Guess what? Mr. Warbucks is going
to take you to see the president.

591
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,075
Oh, boy!

592
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,955
Aren't Republicans ostentatious?

593
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:40,671
Franklin, behave.
It's astonishing he's here at all.

594
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:49,475
- What do you call this, Oliver?
- An autocopter.

595
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,715
You don't need an airport.
They say it can land on a dime.

596
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,476
- Whatever that may be.
- You being here means a great deal.

597
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,675
It means nothing. It means only
that Annie wanted to meet you.

598
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:12,995
- Nice to meet you, Mr. President.
- It's my pleasure, Annie.

599
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,875
Thank you for bringing the old goat.
We'll make a New Dealer of him yet.

600
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,192
- Inconceivable.
- Don't mind him, Oliver.

601
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,953
Come along, Annie.

602
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:27,075
My Uncle Theodore used to teach
his children to walk on stilts.

603
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:32,355
I can't teach you to do that, but
you can roll in a chair with wheels.

604
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:37,912
The New Deal is badly planned,
badly organized and administered.

605
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,913
You don't think your
programs through.

606
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,958
Think what you're going to do
to the economy in the long run!

607
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,869
- People don't eat in the long run.
- People can't feed their children.

608
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,196
The lucky ones are left in orphanages.

609
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,715
The older ones steal, starve.

610
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,480
This country is run on business...

611
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,838
Take them off the dole and put
them to work. That's what I'll do.

612
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:04,955
In the National Parks, clearing trails,
fighting fires, planting trees.

613
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,868
- Hold it.
- I want to feed them and pay them.

614
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,995
Not much, but enough so they can
be proud to be Americans.

615
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:21,235
- That's a swell idea.
- It's mistaken foolishness.

616
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,590
Big-hearted and empty-headed.

617
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,509
Which parks? Which children?
What will it cost?

618
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,399
Who's going to run it?

619
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,109
- I was hoping you would.
- Me?

620
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,995
- And Annie.
- Leaping lizards!

621
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,313
- Out of the question.
- How can I help?

622
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,879
Wait a minute!

623
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,718
You can help us
recruit the young people.

624
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:46,915
Hold everything!

625
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,199
They think their government
doesn't care.

626
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,398
With your help
we could convince them otherwise...

627
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,119
I want to say something.

628
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:00,717
There's a song I used to sing
in the orphanage when I was sad.

629
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,350
- It always cheered me up.
- Eleanor!

630
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,039
Oh, Franklin.

631
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,276
You'll help us too,
won't you, Oliver?

632
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,989
Think of the children.
Think of Annie.

633
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,874
Sing, Oliver, that's an order
from your commander in chief.

634
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,839
- Eleanor?
- I can't sing.

635
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,399
Sing.

636
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,672
Solo for the president.

637
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,917
Everybody!
Republicans too, Oliver.

638
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:29,675
All right, everybody, step up.
I've got fresh fish here.

639
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,078
- Do you run this establishment?
- Unfortunately.

640
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,592
Ten years ago we left our
little baby girl on the front steps.

641
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:55,755
There was a job managing a hotel,
but only if we had no children.

642
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:01,156
- Wrap it up quick.
- We never meant to leave Annie.

643
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,475
Now we have a hardware store in
New Jersey. We can take care of her.

644
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,153
We've always loved her.

645
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:14,195
- You're Annie's parents?
- We live over the store.

646
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,713
- There's a yard out back.
- With chickens.

647
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,871
And a rooster.

648
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,873
Rooster?

649
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,877
My God! I never would
have recognized you.

650
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,875
If we can fool you,
we can fool "Big Bucks."

651
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,869
- 50,000 smackers.
- You'll be the death of me.

652
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:50,517
Sis, this is going to be
the best bunco job ever.

653
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:55,675
- We need details.
- About Annie. Specifics.

654
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:00,796
- What's in it for me?
- A three-way-split of the $50,000.

655
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,396
- I want half.
- All right, half!

656
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,677
Twenty-five grand for me and LiI,
25 grand for you.

657
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,477
Why don't we wait
to see what she's got?

658
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,476
See if it's worth 25 grand.

659
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:25,635
You want details? I've got specifics
on every kid in this dump.

660
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,358
It's just finding the right box.

661
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,479
Annie wears a locket around her neck.

662
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,276
It's a broken locket.

663
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:43,270
She says her parents saved the other
half to come and claim her with.

664
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:48,350
Years ago,
her parents were killed in a fire.

665
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,951
This is all their junk.

666
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:54,072
So, baby brother...

667
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,915
...we can also claim her
with that locket.

668
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:02,912
- 50,000 smackers.
- The kid we'll drop in the river.

669
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,596
They're going to do
something bad to Annie!

670
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,678
- Have you cleaned the can?
- Listen to me. I mean it.

671
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,199
Clean the can!

672
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,712
- Duffy, Tessie, somebody!
- Do you want a knuckle sandwich?

673
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,269
- We've got to warn Annie!
- Scrub!

674
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,791
It's in a sealed envelope.

675
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,674
The little brat.
Look in those!

676
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,112
Make yourself useful!

677
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:05,071
Open it.

678
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,669
Hurry.

679
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,439
Hit it, Sis.

680
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,715
Now do the other one.

681
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,309
Duffy, Tessie, somebody! They're
going to do something to Annie!

682
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,158
- Who is?
- They are!

683
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,118
- Who's they?
- Miss Hannigan.

684
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,918
Oh, my goodness!

685
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,117
Beautiful.

686
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,513
- Where do you think you're going?
- Go tell Annie.

687
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,113
Stop them.

688
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,318
Get in that closet.

689
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,910
Stop it.

690
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,917
Whose rotten idea was this?

691
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,511
Are they here?

692
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,311
If a man counts his chickens before
they hatch, he gets a scrambled egg.

693
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,875
- Have my parents come for me?
- We haven't found them.

694
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,035
I interviewed 865 couples.
None of them knew about the locket.

695
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,114
I never realized how many dishonest
people there are in New York.

696
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:18,635
They're dead. I guess I've known
that deep down for a long time.

697
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,118
I'm not giving up, so don't you.

698
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:26,918
I didn't want to be just another
orphan. I wanted to be special.

699
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:31,517
You are special.
Never stop believing that.

700
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,515
We're trapped.

701
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,717
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

702
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,310
- We'll never get out of here.
- I've got an idea.

703
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:52,516
Great idea.

704
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,319
- It's heavy.
- Don't drop it.

705
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,116
All right, lean it over.

706
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:13,352
I'm not sure I want to do this.
We'll be in so much trouble.

707
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,115
- Duffy, hand me something.
- Here.

708
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,912
There's space up here.

709
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,709
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

710
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,916
Help me get up.

711
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,910
It's a long way down.
Are you sure you want to do this?

712
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,310
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

713
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:22,835
We were starving. We needed the job.
That's why we left our little girl.

714
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:28,395
- Wrapped in a newspaper.
- On the steps of the orphanage.

715
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:38,909
What's this?

716
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:42,232
This is Ralph and Shirley Mudge
from Hoboken, New Jersey.

717
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,708
Annie!

718
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:52,715
Ralph, look!
She still has the locket.

719
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,876
We finally found you.

720
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,554
You heard about the reward
on the radio.

721
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:14,155
- Reward?
- We don't have a radio.

722
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,958
- In the paper.
- Paper?

723
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,112
- What paper?
- How did you know Annie was here?

724
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:23,876
- The lady at the orphanage told us.
- I have her birth certificate here.

725
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:30,349
I've kept it close to my heart
all of these years.

726
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,437
"Ann Marie Mudge.

727
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:41,595
October 18th, 1922."

728
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,111
I'll go pack.

729
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:54,518
Do you want me to help, baby?

730
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,713
No, thanks, Mom.

731
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,992
Come on.

732
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:49,115
A certified cheque!

733
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:54,318
We're so glad to have found Annie.
We don't need this.

734
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:59,475
- I'll take it back.
- Of course, we are poor people.

735
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:03,350
It would help us a lot.

736
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,355
We could buy her milk, a warm blanket.

737
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:14,716
Put it in your pocket, Mrs. Mudge.

738
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,311
Come on, you guys.

739
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:28,115
- Oh, my goodness!
- We're never going to make it.

740
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:32,512
- We've found Fifth Avenue.
- Number one, Fifth Avenue.

741
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:35,917
We've got to go to 987.

742
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,509
- Molly, get on my back.
- Come on, you guys, help.

743
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:49,110
- Will the stores take this back?
- All your new clothes?

744
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,753
I guess so.
Don't you want to keep them?

745
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,915
My folks are poor. All these clothes
are going to make them feel bad.

746
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:03,035
- Take them to the orphanage.
- Certainly.

747
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,714
This will look so cute on Molly.

748
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,515
This'll look good on Duffy.

749
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:15,116
Did you get it? Let me see it.

750
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:20,795
- I'd better keep it.
- Over my dead body.

751
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,549
- That's a good idea.
- Give me that.

752
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:27,509
Help, Mr. Warbucks!

753
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:36,517
We'll never find the house.

754
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,110
When I get my half!

755
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,155
- I say we go back.
- We can't.

756
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,356
We've been walking for 100 years!

757
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,434
- We're never going to get there.
- But we have to.

758
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:02,549
- Let's take a vote.
- All in favour of calling it quits?

759
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,112
- I'll get a gold lamé number.
- In Atlantic City.

760
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:13,512
We aren't stopping
till we hit Atlantic City.

761
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,713
- Help, Mr. Warbucks.
- Shut up, kid.

762
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:26,713
Look, there's Sandy!

763
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:32,234
Come here.

764
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,718
Come on, let's go!

765
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,110
Hurry up.

766
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,713
I can't run anymore.

767
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,918
Quiet down, girls.

768
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:10,519
You want to see Mr. Warbucks?
All right, come on.

769
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,516
Oh, my goodness!

770
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,758
- What now?
- Sir.

771
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,833
- I think he's a highness.
- Your Highness.

772
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:14,311
- We're friends of Annie's.
- Annie's gone.

773
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,917
- Her parents took her away.
- But they weren't her parents.

774
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:23,312
- They were bad people.
- Leaping lizards!

775
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,114
You take the autocopter.

776
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:35,110
J. Edgar? Warbucks here.
Orphan Annie has been kidnapped.

777
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:38,869
I want every G-man on this
in the next 20 minutes.

778
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:43,910
Where's the fire, fellas?

779
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,670
The truck is on Canal Street,
heading east.

780
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,919
Well done, Punjab. Don't lose them.

781
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,915
Can we stop? I've got to go.

782
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,315
I've really got to, Miss Hannigan.

783
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:13,636
I mean it. When you've got to go,
you've got to go.

784
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:24,116
Make it fast.

785
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,513
Rooster, grab her.
She's got the cheque.

786
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:38,759
- Cut her off at the bridge.
- Goddamn it!

787
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,909
Come back here, you goddamn kid!

788
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,909
Mr. Warbucks will eat your livers.

789
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:11,035
- I'll kill you.
- He's really going to kill her.

790
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:17,076
Rooster, stop!

791
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,080
Rooster, she's a baby.

792
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:24,718
Come back here.

793
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:31,919
Rooster!

794
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,309
She may be a mean,
rotten, little orphan...

795
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,351
...but I'm not going
to let you kill her.

796
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,238
Let go of me, you boozer!

797
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,511
Stop it!

798
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:32,150
- They're at the bridge.
- Turn right.

799
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,277
I know.

800
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:04,834
Help, somebody!

801
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:08,510
Leave me alone.

802
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,916
Please, help.

803
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,591
Help!

804
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,711
Have we got two nets?

805
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:57,910
Please, Punjab, help me.

806
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,111
Punjab, help.

807
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:10,116
- You must hold on.
- I can't.

808
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,915
Buddha says a child without courage
is like a night without stars.

809
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:29,280
Rooster, you reprobate.

810
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,193
Annie!

811
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:07,514
"To Annie, with love."

812
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:11,113
I love you, Daddy Warbucks.
