1
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:47,824
Oh, the Queen! Where's the Queen?

2
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,690
The Queen is gone! Cleopatra!

3
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,855
Cleopatra's gone! What on earth do you mean?

4
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:58,824
Pothinos.

5
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:01,923
Here is your new kingdom, Cleopatra.

6
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:05,262
Here you can command the asps
and scorpions of the desert.

7
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:08,534
Maybe they will bow low
and whisper "Majesty. "

8
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,567
If my hands were free, I'd
kill you. But I am more kind.

9
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:17,076
I leave you this mighty
schoolmaster. Set him free.

10
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,184
Apollodorus.

11
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:25,120
With his help, you might
reach Syria over there.

12
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:29,118
And the way to Egypt? Is death.

13
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,422
Set foot in Alexandria
again, and I'll kill you.

14
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:37,362
I have heard that Caesar comes
to Alexandria, Prime Minister.

15
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:40,530
I'm returning to meet
with Caesar, Philosopher.

16
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:43,836
Goodbye, Cleopatra, Queen of the Desert.

17
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:49,144
You'll find, to your sorrow,
I'm still Queen of Egypt.

18
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:02,855
Untie me.

19
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:11,266
You understand, my Queen, he
returns to meet with Caesar.

20
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:16,035
Is this a time to talk of Romans?
I've had no breakfast. I'm hungry.

21
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,971
So is Caesar hungry. For Egypt.

22
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:21,170
You see how wise your father was...

23
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:24,807
to make Rome the protector of you
and your brother, King Ptolemy?

24
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,746
They've got you out of the way
to deal with your brother alone.

25
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,616
They can handle him.

26
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,351
I'll get back to Alexandria.
Majesty, it's death.

27
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,818
It's certain death to go.

28
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,765
How old is this Caesar?

29
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,872
I am told you have
arrived at a conclusion, Caesar.

30
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:00,878
I have.

31
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:05,322
Is it your judgment to support
the cause of Ptolemy or his sister?

32
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,482
Your young King Ptolemy has raised an army...

33
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,584
to crush his sister, Queen Cleopatra.

34
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,458
It must be disbanded.

35
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,599
As the general of that
army, suppose I refuse?

36
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,432
Well, we'll go into that if you
do, but I don't think you will.

37
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,141
Good model. Build it.

38
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,804
By what authority do you
judge the destiny of Egypt?

39
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,871
I am here to see
that there is peace in Egypt.

40
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:33,440
With a Roman army waiting at the border?

41
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:40,152
Excellence, would you not enter
into a treaty with the King...

42
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,921
if the Queen has disappeared? Has she?

43
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:46,259
Rumor says that
Cleopatra has fled to Syria.

44
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:49,364
She must have. She's not here.

45
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,835
Maybe she was assisted in
her flight. Who can tell?

46
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:55,128
Who can tell?

47
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:59,206
Well, from what I hear of
her, small loss to Egypt.

48
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,305
In such a case, your
king would be sole ruler.

49
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,313
Under Roman guidance.

50
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,581
And you would pay to
Rome each year one million denarii.

51
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:11,417
One million denarii! One million denarii!

52
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:15,653
And 10 shiploads of Egyptian
corn for the unemployed in Rome.

53
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:19,993
Ten ships of corn. Ten thousand
votes in Rome for Caesar.

54
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,363
A hundred thousand maybe.

55
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:24,934
Who can tell?

56
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:28,603
Well, I'm waiting.

57
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,806
Agreed.

58
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,503
Let him sign it.

59
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:37,874
A letter. Julius Caesar to the Senate, Rome.

60
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:42,483
A rug of Persia. A gift for
Caesar from Nahigian the merchant.

61
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,454
We give nothing to Romans here.

62
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:46,114
Did you say for Caesar?

63
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:48,381
Pass on.

64
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:51,552
What do you think you own,
the Earth? Yes.

65
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,397
And we have made a settlement with Egypt
whereby we support young Ptolemy as King.

66
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,435
Your seal, Excellence.

67
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:01,438
Against the sedition of
his sister, Cleopatra...

68
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:04,100
who, by all reports, has fled to Syria.

69
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:08,201
A gift for Caesar, fit even for his eyes.

70
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,209
Thanks. Give him something.

71
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,647
The wax is ready for your seal, Caesar.

72
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:17,811
The rug, Excellence. Will you receive it?

73
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:20,016
What? Yes, yes, put it down.

74
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,019
Excellence, the wax is cooling.

75
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:28,926
Observe, Caesar. A most unusual design.

76
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:32,426
What? Well!

77
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,470
Greetings to Caesar from Egypt.

78
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,432
A very amusing joke.

79
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,007
Very good.

80
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:50,354
But I'm too busy.

81
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:51,944
Huh?

82
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,454
What's the matter? Tell him, Pothinos.

83
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:02,990
Tell him what's the matter, if your
lying tongue can find the words.

84
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,639
I am Cleopatra. Huh?

85
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,538
Yes, a good joke.

86
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,838
She is Cleopatra, and I am Caesar.

87
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,469
Come on. I'll take her away. No, you won't.

88
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,673
Enough of this. Caesar, you must listen.

89
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:19,808
He abducted me to the desert
and left me there to die.

90
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:23,082
But nothing could stop me from greeting you.

91
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:26,282
Are you to be fooled by a...
No, I am not to be fooled.

92
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,489
It's dangerous to lie to me, Pothinos.

93
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,654
But, Caesar, I thought it would
be best all around if she...

94
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,095
Then you did lie to me.

95
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,860
So you would match wits with Caesar?

96
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,396
Oh, no.

97
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,703
All right, run along now.

98
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:47,870
The seal, Caesar. Not yet.

99
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:52,011
This quarrel with your brother
will be settled in Rome.

100
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,675
That's all. Withdraw.

101
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:55,743
Come, Majesty. Enough.

102
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,422
Before I go, one word more?

103
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,431
Well? Well?

104
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:16,263
It seems strange to see you working.

105
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:20,436
I've always pictured you
either fighting or loving.

106
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,107
Well, I have had some
experience with fighting.

107
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:28,709
But none with loving, I suppose.

108
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:32,048
Well, none with pretty little queens.

109
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
Oh. That was nice.

110
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,163
And now, with your permission,
I'll go to work again.

111
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:45,034
The dispatches from Gaul.

112
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:56,309
<i>What... Oh, run along.</i>

113
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:00,507
If I leave
you now, I'll be killed.

114
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,300
Pothinos has sworn to kill me.

115
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:28,805
Pothinos has said that if I ever set
foot in Alexandria again, he'd kill me.

116
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,643
The map of Gaul.

117
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:36,310
Well!

118
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,582
He usually does those things, you know.

119
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,358
Can't you see I'm busy?

120
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,031
India.

121
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,471
Of course.

122
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,308
Of course I know you're very busy...

123
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,843
but I thought you might
like to talk about India.

124
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,820
What? What about India?

125
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:14,789
<i>It's the treasure house of the
East. With enough gold to...</i>

126
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:19,993
Oh, but you're much too busy. We'll talk
about it tomorrow. If I'm still alive.

127
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,535
What about India?

128
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:36,307
Well, the road to India lies through Egypt.

129
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,709
And the Queen of Egypt,
allied with Caesar could...

130
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,945
Why didn't you say that right away?

131
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,955
My tongue was bewitched by Caesar.

132
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:50,457
The man in you seems even
mightier than the general.

133
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,361
Egypt.

134
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,667
Sit down.

135
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,847
Pretty girl. Charming.

136
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,344
Now.

137
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:16,017
Now, what do you know of India?

138
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,317
Oh, nothing much.

139
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,379
Ah.

140
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,991
But its gold would pay
Caesar's legions for a century.

141
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:27,623
Well! Now that's something to talk about.

142
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:30,259
Yes, but not here.

143
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:35,004
Come to my chambers and
dine. We'll make such plans.

144
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:38,040
Are your plans for India or me?

145
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,567
Both.

146
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:43,378
Shouldn't a queen choose
for her confidant a king?

147
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:51,986
The word "king" is not well-liked in Rome.

148
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,454
Caesar takes what he wants.

149
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:01,721
Flavius.

150
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,229
My own guard for the Queen's safety.

151
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:39,631
I had to walk miles across
the desert to the sea...

152
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:43,532
to find the fishing boat
that brought me to you.

153
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:50,644
But just seeing you is
magic, immortal Caesar.

154
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,947
That's quite a speech.

155
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:00,122
Your tongue is no longer
bewitched by Caesar, eh?

156
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:01,347
No.

157
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,723
It's my heart now.

158
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:10,763
That's strange, too. I've never loved before.

159
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:12,694
Love?

160
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:19,737
If you'd bring true the dreams of
empire that fill your pretty head...

161
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:21,571
leave love alone.

162
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:26,278
I can't. It's too late.

163
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,540
Ah.

164
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:29,976
It's too late.

165
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:35,187
Will you do something that
will make me very happy?

166
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,727
I am here to make you very happy.

167
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,624
Then drive Pothinos out of Egypt.

168
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,530
Drive him? Where?

169
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:46,703
Into the desert where he drove me. No.

170
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:54,605
I came to talk of India,
not the quarrels of Egypt.

171
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,078
But I am Egypt.

172
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,709
If I make you so.

173
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:22,371
I was wrong.

174
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:25,034
Let's not talk at all tonight.

175
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:28,078
Perhaps there's nothing to talk about, ever.

176
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,946
You don't trust me?

177
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,175
No.

178
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,779
And if I said I really love
you, you wouldn't believe me?

179
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,181
No.

180
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:48,022
And if I implored you to
marry me, you wouldn't?

181
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:50,464
I'd have to ask my wife in Rome.

182
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,670
As if you'd care about that.

183
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:00,168
Divorce her. Together we
could conquer the world.

184
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,570
Nice of you to include me.

185
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,315
I will be Caesar's wife and ally.

186
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:09,116
You rate yourself highly, my child.

187
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:15,117
So a woman isn't strong enough
to help the mighty Caesar?

188
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:19,891
Caesar.

189
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,595
Have you ever thought
what your life is worth?

190
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,195
Well, it's worth a great deal to me.

191
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:32,140
It must be worth a great
deal to others. Mine is.

192
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,944
And I'm only the Queen of Egypt...

193
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:40,649
while Caesar, if he lives,
will be Emperor of the world.

194
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:44,815
If he lives?

195
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,887
Life is a precious thing, isn't it?

196
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,225
I think so.

197
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:56,661
Hadn't you better put that javelin down?

198
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,904
And if a man swears to
take the life of another...

199
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:05,500
death is justice for him. I think so.

200
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:21,855
Pothinos.

201
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,555
He came to kill you.

202
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:24,786
Or you.

203
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:32,835
Passage to the tombs. I saw
his sandal beneath the curtain.

204
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:38,038
And now am I worth talking to?

205
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,235
<i>More...</i>

206
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:44,113
Well, far more than Pothinos.

207
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:56,115
Guards!

208
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:00,057
Take it away.

209
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,541
Let's not talk anymore.

210
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:19,612
I picked a flower in Britain
once, the color of your eyes.

211
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:41,032
This is the first morning he's
been late since the day he was born.

212
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:46,735
Ho, there! Caesar comes!

213
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,751
Well, well, come on,
come on. Let's go to work.

214
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,543
Hold that letter to the Senate.

215
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,815
But the agreement with
the King's Prime Minister.

216
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,117
Destroy it.

217
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:02,920
Even I can't reach an
agreement with a corpse.

218
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:04,651
The Prime Minister is dead.

219
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:06,697
Then we deal with the King?

220
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:10,556
The Queen. Cleopatra is sole ruler of Egypt.

221
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:14,699
And I find that I shall be
here longer than I thought.

222
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,100
But the galley, Caesar, is ordered to sail.

223
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:18,903
When I say so.

224
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:22,506
A letter to Marc Antony, Rome.

225
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:30,920
Here, you're with me.

226
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,422
Nobody ever hears from him.

227
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:41,056
Except Marc Antony. He gets
a letter every week or so.

228
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:44,465
Is it true that Caesar is really
in love... Child, child.

229
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:46,901
But he doesn't come back to Rome, does he?

230
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,531
Well, he's missing a lovely party today.

231
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,108
He doesn't miss very much any day.

232
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:54,303
The Queen of Egypt gives parties, too.

233
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:55,436
You mean Cleopatra?

234
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:58,175
Whoa! What? Have you heard of Cleopatra?

235
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:02,049
Of course. All kinds of things. Is she black?

236
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:06,789
Calpurnia.

237
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:09,014
My lady.

238
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,789
How beautiful you are. Is there
anything I can get for you?

239
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:12,851
Yes, a little luck.

240
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,330
The loveliest party you've
ever given, Calpurnia.

241
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:17,458
Thank you, Flora. Wonderful.

242
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:21,132
The wife is always the last one to know.

243
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:23,605
So is the husband, when it comes to that.

244
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:27,240
They say he's planning
to move the capital to Egypt.

245
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:29,006
We were talking of the games.

246
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,808
Have you seen the new circus, Calpurnia?

247
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:32,712
I haven't been to the
games since Caesar left.

248
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:36,184
You should enjoy life more, Calpurnia.
Even Caesar's wife should play.

249
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:38,244
Why not? She's above suspicion.

250
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:42,585
We waited two hours for you
yesterday. What kept you?

251
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,992
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll explain it later.

252
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:47,553
When is Caesar coming back? Ever?

253
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:51,332
Tullius, I'm so sorry to hear
about your brother's exile.

254
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:53,802
I shall ask a pardon for
him when Caesar returns.

255
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:55,498
I hope he grants it.

256
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,032
If Caesar returns.

257
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,775
If Caesar returns.

258
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:05,177
It's rumored all over Rome.
It's been known for days.

259
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,006
If what you say is true, Cassius...

260
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:09,314
we're in a desperate situation.

261
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:10,444
But I can't believe it.

262
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:12,682
It is true, Brutus.
I heard with my own ears.

263
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:15,384
Quiet, Casca. Let Brutus speak.

264
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,394
The people love you, Brutus.

265
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:19,656
They love Caesar.

266
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,061
But he would make himself king.

267
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:22,996
And then, where are we?

268
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,824
If I had proof of that...

269
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:27,496
He plans to divorce
Calpurnia and marry a queen.

270
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:28,629
This Cleopatra.

271
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:31,834
And call himself King of Rome. Of us.

272
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:34,406
Emperor of the world.

273
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:37,675
Was I not born as free as
Caesar? And you? And you?

274
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:38,941
Caesar.

275
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,345
He's everywhere.

276
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,250
Rome is a republic.

277
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:47,847
It wants no crown.

278
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,855
It will have no king.

279
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,722
Octavia. Hello, dear.

280
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:55,662
Hello, dear. Hello, Octavian.

281
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,201
Oh, it's a delightful party.
Sit down with us a moment.

282
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:59,327
Where's Antony?

283
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,566
Does any wife ever
know where her husband is?

284
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:05,567
Calpurnia knows where her husband is.

285
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:09,071
Sit down just for
a minute. You look tired.

286
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:10,844
Just for a minute.

287
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:13,579
No news at all from Caesar, eh?

288
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:17,246
I don't expect any. He's too busy, Octavian.

289
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:20,051
Well, he shouldn't be
too busy to write to me.

290
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:24,019
He writes to Marc Antony.
Why Antony and not me?

291
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:26,587
Why? Tell me why.

292
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:30,156
Wouldn't you think he'd know the last
people you write to are relatives?

293
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:32,930
But I'm more than Caesar's
nephew, I'm his heir.

294
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,097
You're my brother, and Marc's my
husband. I know you both pretty well.

295
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:40,541
And if I were Caesar, I would
certainly write to Marc Antony.

296
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,337
Ho, there! Marc Antony comes!

297
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:44,947
Oh, Marc Antony's here!

298
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,589
Wait, wait, wait. I have news.

299
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:58,787
News?
Another letter from Caesar?

300
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:01,353
More than a letter. Caesar is entering Rome.

301
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:03,093
Caesar is entering Rome!

302
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:10,734
Marc Antony, please. I
must see you for one day.

303
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:14,170
No, no, not now. I came to get Calpurnia.

304
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,572
Slave. Take them.

305
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,515
Did you all hear? Yes.

306
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:23,446
Well, well, and who is this pretty maid?

307
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,851
Hello, darling.

308
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:26,219
"Hello, darling"?

309
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:30,891
You'd think she had met me
before. Or is it my fame she seeks?

310
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,930
Oh, he hasn't been to bed. He always
talks like this when he hasn't...

311
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:35,966
Sleep. I'm above sleep, my beloved wife.

312
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,058
I'm glad you're above something.

313
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,626
Ah, in his usual gay mood.

314
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:43,729
But, come on. We must
hurry. You ready, Calpurnia?

315
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:45,468
I'm not going. Sorry?

316
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:48,607
I shall wait for my husband here.

317
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,375
What's the matter? Nothing.

318
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:54,212
Oh, yes, there is. There's
a great deal the matter.

319
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:58,712
And I'm in no hurry to watch
Caesar's triumphal entry into Rome.

320
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:00,548
Why, what's the matter with you?

321
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:02,353
Do you take us all for fools?

322
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:04,758
Don't you think we know
what Caesar plans to do?

323
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:06,659
And what does Caesar plan to do?

324
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,698
Well, go and listen to him
in the Senate tomorrow...

325
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:10,461
and you'll learn what he plans to do.

326
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:13,867
We don't have to. It's no music
to our ears to hear him desert us.

327
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:16,303
He's drunk with Egypt, and he's deserting us.

328
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:18,705
Antony! Antony! No! Octavian, no!

329
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:20,371
Antony...

330
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:22,772
I know.

331
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,346
There he is! There he is!

332
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:53,436
Caesar! Hail! Hail, Caesar!

333
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:46,919
I thought she gave money.
Her dress is all gold.

334
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:55,895
She's too gorgeous.

335
00:27:57,674 --> 00:27:59,699
In the shape of a sphinx.

336
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:04,609
But she is beautiful. She is.

337
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:06,114
Oh, I don't know.

338
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,782
Oh, but look
at all those chariots!

339
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:30,401
Caesar.

340
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,399
Beware the Ides of March.

341
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:36,375
One date is as
good as another for a funeral.

342
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:38,442
Beware.

343
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:44,711
You may go now. We need nothing more.

344
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:53,525
Well, Brutus, was I right
about... Be careful.

345
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:56,229
Must we whisper what all Rome growls?

346
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,927
Yes, I believe.

347
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:01,266
Now that I know he's divorcing
Calpurnia to marry her.

348
00:29:01,338 --> 00:29:03,499
That might be his private affair...

349
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:07,874
but tomorrow he'll force the Senate
to declare him Emperor and King.

350
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:11,246
And present Cleopatra to them as... Queen.

351
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:14,612
Our Queen, Brutus. Our Queen.

352
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,945
No, Rome cannot be turned
into another Orient...

353
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:21,820
with golden thrones for a king and queen.

354
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:26,863
But I suppose he'll sway
the Senate as he always has.

355
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,295
Oh, no, he won't.

356
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:31,868
We'll greet Caesar before
he greets the Senate...

357
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,670
and a little blood will be spilled for Rome.

358
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:49,547
<i>So today you go before the Senate to...</i>

359
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:53,182
Well, all I can say is I
think it's your first mistake.

360
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:55,987
All I can say is I don't care what you think.

361
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,553
You always did care what I thought.

362
00:29:58,629 --> 00:29:59,789
You always agreed.

363
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:00,852
Ah.

364
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:03,926
I don't hate women for nothing.

365
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:06,492
Enobarbus speaks. And speaks well.

366
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,630
What's this?
Antony hates women, too?

367
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:13,804
Out of their place, I do.
They've no place amongst men.

368
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:17,813
They can't think, and they can't
fight. They're just playthings for us.

369
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:20,111
Most of them. All of them.

370
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:22,245
A woman's a woman.

371
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:26,884
We speak freely to you
because we are your friends.

372
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:28,456
I know that.

373
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:31,392
You say that the whole idea of
this marriage to Cleopatra...

374
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:35,454
is to capture India and then the
world. Does that sound like you?

375
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,289
When did you ever ask anyone's help?

376
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,335
Anything you wanted, you took.

377
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,132
It'll be easier to take it this way.

378
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:42,296
Well. Easier.

379
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,532
A strange word from Caesar.

380
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:46,371
Women soften all men.

381
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:47,774
He sounds like a lover talking.

382
00:30:47,844 --> 00:30:49,505
An Egyptian lover.

383
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,676
That woman's making an Egyptian out of you.

384
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,877
You bring Egyptian ships
and men back with you.

385
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:58,183
You change the calendar of Rome to Egypt's.

386
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:01,452
But you cannot make an Egyptian
queen a ruler over Romans.

387
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,514
Words.

388
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:07,154
Look at the Roman eagle with
half the world in his claws...

389
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,595
tamed by a woman.

390
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:11,433
I'm leaving for the Senate.

391
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:14,026
But, Caesar, you... Are you coming, Antony?

392
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:15,865
No, I'll take no part in it.

393
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:18,032
Any man who wants to make a
fool of himself over a woman...

394
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:20,235
can do so, as far as I'm concerned.

395
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:27,608
I don't know what the young man
means, but he means it violently.

396
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,276
And I agree with him.

397
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:31,082
Then you'd better follow him.

398
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:40,963
Caesar! Caesar!

399
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:43,731
Oh, Caesar.

400
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,792
Oh, you haven't gone.

401
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:49,500
Don't go! Oh, don't go.

402
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:52,738
Don't go. Calpurnia.

403
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:57,142
I've had a dream, a terrible vision.

404
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:03,252
I saw a flaming star falling, and
it was you, your body dripping blood.

405
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:09,090
I saw your toga torn by daggers, wet
with blood, your blood, my husband.

406
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,996
Oh, please, please don't
leave this house today.

407
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,996
It's an evil omen. I know it. I know it.

408
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,597
Calpurnia, my dear...

409
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:22,229
the world's affairs cannot be
stopped because you've had a dream.

410
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:24,330
Casca the Senator.

411
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:27,138
Caesar. Caesar, the Senate waits for you.

412
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,179
No, no, no. You shall not
go. I'll keep you here.

413
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:34,378
Calpurnia has seen a day of
evil for me in her dreams.

414
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:37,251
<i>Perhaps...</i>

415
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:42,190
Shall I return and tell the Senate, which
waits to offer you the world's crown...

416
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:45,624
that they must wait until
Calpurnia's dreams are pleasanter?

417
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:49,597
I'll come. Oh, no, no, Caesar. I beg you.

418
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:53,629
Not for myself but for you.
Oh, please, please, Caesar.

419
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:57,740
Evil is on every
side. I know it. I know it.

420
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:01,305
For what I have done, Calpurnia, pardon.

421
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:05,314
For what I am about to do, courage.

422
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:11,052
No. No!

423
00:33:32,742 --> 00:33:34,266
The swan's feather.

424
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:43,146
Iras, be careful.

425
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,245
I'm trying to keep my hand from shaking...

426
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:48,291
but, Majesty, I'm so excited.

427
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,683
Majesty. Majesty.

428
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,957
Royal robes for the Empress of the world.

429
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,395
Up the stairs.

430
00:33:58,568 --> 00:34:00,195
Before the Queen.

431
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:08,067
And, Majesty, wait until you see
them. They're beautiful, marvelous.

432
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:10,205
Take the lid off.

433
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:13,273
Beautiful!

434
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:16,779
The Roman Senate will get a thrill today.

435
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,418
Choose, Majesty.

436
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:26,322
It's not the Senate I'm worried
about but their fat wives.

437
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,456
Here.

438
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:32,724
Do you know anything
about senators, Charmion?

439
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:35,293
Well, we only got here yesterday, Majesty.

440
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,740
Caesar! My sandals.

441
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:47,647
Hail, Caesar! Caesar comes!

442
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,391
I only stopped for a last salute.

443
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:08,596
Oh, no, wait just a minute. There's
something I want to tell you.

444
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,140
Too late, my love. And
get dressed. Get dressed.

445
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,301
I'll be ready. But the Senate is waiting.

446
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:16,539
Let them wait. I want a
moment all alone. But...

447
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:20,242
No, put your arms around
me. Hold me close to you.

448
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:24,486
I'm frightened of something.

449
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:26,283
Frightened? What's the matter?

450
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:30,091
I love you so much.

451
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,991
And that frightens you?

452
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:35,055
Nothing must happen to you, my Caesar.

453
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:36,826
Nothing will.

454
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,231
I'll send for you the
moment my speech is done.

455
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:43,795
You must be ready.

456
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:51,944
Emperor! Empress!

457
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:58,684
He passes here.

458
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:06,219
Tullius. Decimus.

459
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:09,593
Solinus.

460
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:13,626
Casca. You, there.

461
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:18,266
Brutus, beside the column.

462
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,879
Listen!

463
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:33,646
He must be just arriving.

464
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,484
How long will the speech take?
He's sending for me right after.

465
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,084
You'll be ready. And how you'll look.

466
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:42,293
Do you think you might wear this
dress when you get married, too?

467
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:44,624
What?

468
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:47,602
I was just thinking of the
great Caesar trying to unhook it.

469
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:49,070
Charmion.

470
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:53,965
Listen. Listen to the cheers now.

471
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:59,146
Hail! Hail, Caesar!

472
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:05,885
Hail, Caesar! Caesar, hail!

473
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:17,029
Caesar, I warned you. The Ides of March.

474
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,795
The Ides of March are here.

475
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:20,495
But not gone.

476
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:23,900
Caesar!

477
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,144
Caesar comes! Ah, Caesar.

478
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:37,286
A pardon, Caesar, for my
brother in exile. Denied.

479
00:37:37,354 --> 00:37:38,946
You tyrant! Stand back!

480
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:40,649
Take your hands off me!

481
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:45,051
Let me get out of here!

482
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:48,088
Get off me!

483
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:55,698
You! You, too, Brutus!

484
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:00,808
A great day for Rome.

485
00:38:09,753 --> 00:38:12,847
Am I all right? Marvelous.

486
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:17,086
Beautiful. The senators' eyes
will pop right out of their heads.

487
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,994
Caesar is dead! What?

488
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:22,929
Caesar is dead!

489
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:42,710
Caesar is a traitor to Rome!

490
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:52,322
His speech is over. It must
be. I hear the shouting.

491
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:55,965
Apollodorus, has the messenger come?

492
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:57,363
Not yet.

493
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:00,529
I never saw anything so beautiful.

494
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:02,964
Let me show you.

495
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:07,834
How do you like this?

496
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,037
Gorgeous.

497
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:10,579
Or do you like this?

498
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:21,455
I am only a man. How can I tell?

499
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:24,084
The Queen! The
Queen! Where's the Queen?

500
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Stand! Stand!

501
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:26,353
Stop! Stop!

502
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:28,488
Caesar has been murdered!

503
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:36,670
Royal Egypt, Caesar is dead.

504
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:40,008
How was this? By whom?

505
00:39:40,076 --> 00:39:43,170
I don't know, but I heard
them cry, "Brutus! Cassius!"

506
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,304
As I galloped through the
streets, I heard them shout:

507
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:47,110
"Caesar is a traitor to Rome!"

508
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:53,755
Where is he? Where is Caesar?

509
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,153
Dead, Majesty.

510
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,823
The body lies at the foot of Pompey's statue.

511
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:01,187
No one will touch it.

512
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:08,765
I will.

513
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:13,073
Majesty, you cannot.

514
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,076
No, my Queen. No.

515
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:17,704
Majesty! Majesty!

516
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,874
They come this way. They
cry for Egypt's blood!

517
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:23,043
Man the small boat at the foot of the garden.

518
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,383
## Come, my Queen.

519
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:29,818
Come. We must go. We must
escape. They will kill you.

520
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:33,725
Think of Egypt.

521
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:37,498
"Think of Egypt"?

522
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:40,262
Always Egypt!

523
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:43,572
But Caesar is dead.

524
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:47,075
My Emperor.

525
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,540
That dream is gone.

526
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:50,738
Gone.

527
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:54,776
Yes, gone.

528
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:58,020
What do I care for empire now?

529
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:03,757
Caesar is dead. My lover is dead.

530
00:41:06,095 --> 00:41:07,562
He didn't love you.

531
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:13,100
You lie! You lie! You lie!

532
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:14,466
Majesty.

533
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:29,982
It wasn't in his arms
he wanted to hold Egypt.

534
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:32,250
It was in his treasury.

535
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:33,917
It's true.

536
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,753
You were blind.

537
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:37,349
He didn't love you.

538
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,357
You were blind.

539
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:41,789
Blind.

540
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:48,393
Antony. Always Antony.

541
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:50,530
Sit down, Octavian. Sit down.

542
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:51,767
That's all I do, sit.

543
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:54,036
Well, then sit down. I won't sit down!

544
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,738
See, he can't even sit
down. Antony, Octavian.

545
00:41:56,813 --> 00:42:00,271
Caesar dead only two weeks, and you
fill his house with your quarrels.

546
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,548
The Senate has decreed that you
both shall rule Rome together...

547
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:08,022
and that Antony shall avenge the
death of Caesar upon the traitors...

548
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:09,422
and shall punish Egypt.

549
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:12,188
But why Antony? I'll govern
with you if I have to.

550
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:14,491
But if there's any fighting
to be done, I'll do it alone.

551
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:17,089
Alone. You want to do everything alone.

552
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:20,464
You took advantage of Caesar
lying on his funeral pyre...

553
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:22,470
to gain the public's support for yourself.

554
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:25,166
You used my uncle's dead
body to win control...

555
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:28,335
holding up his bloodstained
toga like any playactor...

556
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:29,935
to make the crowd cheer you.

557
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:32,880
You, with your, "Friends,
Romans, countrymen. "

558
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:35,349
That's enough! Steady.

559
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:41,050
I accept the Senate's order. Good.

560
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,190
And you, Octavian?

561
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:44,726
Oh, I suppose so.

562
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:49,129
And how do you propose to punish Egypt?

563
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:51,993
I shall write a letter
to the Egyptian Queen...

564
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:54,593
demanding that she meet me in
the public square in Tarsus.

565
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:58,368
A letter? The great Marc Antony
fights with friendly notes.

566
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:00,909
Really, Octavian, you
must... No, it's all right.

567
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:04,413
Octavian's right, for once.
It will be a friendly note.

568
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,573
Well, but I don't
understand. Friendly?

569
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:07,843
I see.

570
00:43:08,384 --> 00:43:10,784
She will think the meeting
a friendly discussion...

571
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:13,287
on Roman and Egyptian affairs.

572
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:14,345
Yes.

573
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:18,991
Instead, my legions will be with me in
Tarsus on our way to take Egypt by force.

574
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,126
From Tarsus, I shall send
Cleopatra to Rome in chains.

575
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:27,632
That's more
like the real Marc Antony.

576
00:43:58,968 --> 00:44:00,902
We're approaching Tarsus.

577
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,096
Are we?

578
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,204
And no plans yet, Cleopatra.

579
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:11,546
If you fail, it means slavery
for Egypt and death for you.

580
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:15,845
If you had listened to me, at least
we'd have ships and men with us.

581
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:21,951
Where do we meet Marc Antony?

582
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:26,152
In the public square at noon.

583
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:42,844
Well, why doesn't she
come? How should I know?

584
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:44,903
Where are the two generals
you sent to bring her?

585
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:49,418
Waiting for her, I suppose, like
you and me and the whole Roman army.

586
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:52,978
Waiting for a woman. A woman!

587
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,848
Six hours. While you
stand here and do nothing.

588
00:44:57,927 --> 00:44:59,189
Go and get her.

589
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,554
Well, it's about time.

590
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:05,624
What? Apologize!

591
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,502
I apologize.

592
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:12,132
Watch your tongue, or I'll
cut it out of you! Wait here.

593
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:15,168
I'll go down to her boat and get her myself.

594
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:22,179
Stop there!

595
00:45:22,251 --> 00:45:23,548
Who nears the Queen's barge?

596
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:26,246
I'm Antony of Rome.

597
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:40,459
You're late.

598
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,695
Where are my men?

599
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:45,932
Oh, Charmion.

600
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:50,462
Where are the Romans who
came here today? Do you know?

601
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:52,465
They're sleeping, my Queen.

602
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:53,701
Sleeping? What for?

603
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:56,835
<i>They're... Well, I should
say they were a little tired.</i>

604
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:58,244
You mean a little drunk!

605
00:46:58,314 --> 00:47:01,010
No, awfully drunk.

606
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:03,448
Come and see.

607
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,158
Get someone to fling them ashore.

608
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:24,905
We'll go now. Get ready.

609
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:29,637
Were you speaking to me? Who do you think?

610
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:33,614
I sent orders for you to come to the
square. I'm not used to being disobeyed.

611
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:37,844
And why should I obey you? Your letter
said we had things to talk about.

612
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,514
The letter said that we would meet
in the public square in Tarsus...

613
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:42,147
and that's where we're going.

614
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:44,151
Oh.

615
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:50,260
We can't talk here then?

616
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,426
No, we cannot talk here.

617
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:54,867
Talk? With all this?

618
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,533
Oh, how different from your generals.

619
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:03,775
Well, I guess I must confess everything.

620
00:48:03,846 --> 00:48:07,373
I must tell you why I wanted to
meet you here instead of the square.

621
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,474
Well?

622
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:11,214
Do you see the way I'm dressed?

623
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:13,847
What about it?

624
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,583
I'm dressed to lure you, Antony.

625
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:23,328
You see all this? It was
all a plan. And you know why?

626
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:26,101
Because it was my only chance.

627
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:31,839
Don't you think I know you're my
enemy, you and your hungry Rome?

628
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:38,071
But I suppose it was the most
stupid thing I could have done.

629
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:42,243
Why, do you know I had show after
show with which to dazzle you?

630
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:47,654
But Antony is not a man to be
dazzled if he doesn't please. No.

631
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:52,956
What do you care for this, for instance?

632
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:54,821
Watch.

633
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:15,205
I wish you could see your face. Huh?

634
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:18,474
I'd have more chance with a stone wall.

635
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:32,186
Will you forgive me for being such a fool?

636
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:36,891
I should have known that Antony
is not Antony for nothing.

637
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:39,194
Well, shall we go now?

638
00:50:39,568 --> 00:50:43,937
Yes, we'll go. My wits have
failed, and I'm in your hands.

639
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:48,808
But what could I do? No,
what would you have done?

640
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:51,244
Pretend you're me and I'm you.

641
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:57,150
No, no. No, no. You're
Cleopatra and I'm Antony.

642
00:51:00,322 --> 00:51:01,687
Do I look like that?

643
00:51:01,757 --> 00:51:03,520
Well, do I?

644
00:51:05,294 --> 00:51:08,127
I think you'd better stay as Cleopatra.

645
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:14,659
Oh, no, no. Don't drink that. No,
that was part of the plan, too.

646
00:51:15,137 --> 00:51:18,766
I was going to get you so irresponsible.

647
00:51:18,841 --> 00:51:21,275
You didn't think one
goblet would do it, did you?

648
00:51:21,343 --> 00:51:22,970
Yes, wouldn't it?

649
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,778
Well, that does amuse me.

650
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:29,113
But it's such a large goblet.

651
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:30,847
Yes, isn't it?

652
00:51:34,924 --> 00:51:35,982
Well.

653
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:39,555
Well.

654
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:47,730
I hope that you know that I
know you want me to do this.

655
00:51:48,337 --> 00:51:53,036
Dear Antony, I hope you think
I know that you know I know.

656
00:51:58,414 --> 00:51:59,403
Oh.

657
00:52:11,126 --> 00:52:13,117
No, we're not dining here after all.

658
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:14,321
No, wait.

659
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:20,200
What is it? Reed birds from the Nile.

660
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:22,834
Are they any good? Oh,
they're supposed to be.

661
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:26,602
There's not very much to it,
is there? Then we may dine here?

662
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:29,838
I'm really very hungry.

663
00:52:29,912 --> 00:52:31,311
So am I, when it comes to that.

664
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,974
Your little reed birds aren't enough for me.

665
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:38,185
No, wait, Antony.

666
00:52:38,587 --> 00:52:41,886
Clams from the sea. They're
catching them now. Come and see.

667
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:00,362
Jewels.

668
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:04,069
You are a good fisherman.

669
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:08,671
The golden streams of Egypt never run dry.

670
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:17,817
Throw them.

671
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:19,180
Roman dogs.

672
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:23,749
Yes, Egyptian cats.

673
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:05,557
<i># Starlit night #</i>

674
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:13,265
<i># Let enchantment bright #</i>

675
00:56:14,736 --> 00:56:17,796
<i># Weave a spell on him #</i>

676
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:20,569
<i># Whom I love #</i>

677
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:25,440

00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:33,214
<i># Hear the prayer of thy slave #</i>

679
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,924

680
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:41,595

681
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:47,063
<i># Hear thy slave #</i>

682
00:56:51,473 --> 00:56:55,136
<i># Hear thy slave ##</i>

683
00:56:57,813 --> 00:56:59,804
A song to the stars.

684
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:06,350
They must think we're funny people...

685
00:57:07,956 --> 00:57:12,791
scheming to destroy each other
as if we had forever to live.

686
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:16,998
They must wonder:

687
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:20,759
"Why don't Egypt and Rome
meet in the public square...

688
00:57:21,403 --> 00:57:25,134
"to plan union instead of conquest?"

689
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:30,877
Yes, it's very funny.

690
00:57:32,114 --> 00:57:35,914
I said things to Caesar I wish I hadn't.

691
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:37,741
Oh?

692
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:42,249
There's beauty in the Egyptian
Queen besides her face.

693
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,325
Do you miss him?

694
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:51,692
No, he didn't love me.

695
00:57:52,935 --> 00:57:54,425
Is that really the reason?

696
00:57:55,771 --> 00:58:00,231
No, not really. I admire
men who don't love women.

697
00:58:00,842 --> 00:58:02,469
What do you mean by that?

698
00:58:02,544 --> 00:58:03,841
Oh, I don't know.

699
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:09,043
Women should be but toys for
the great. It becomes them both.

700
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:11,752
To you for that.

701
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:13,076
Oh.

702
00:58:14,957 --> 00:58:16,686
And to you for that.

703
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:39,012
Why, Antony. What?

704
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:42,249
Did I hear you hiccup?
Not me. I never hiccup.

705
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:45,545
Well, it certainly wasn't
me. Queens don't hiccup.

706
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:51,357
Well, I don't know whether they do
or not. They most certainly do not.

707
00:58:51,426 --> 00:58:53,223
Queens only talk of stars.

708
00:58:55,964 --> 00:59:00,367
Well, who do you suppose it can be?
Because I'm sure I heard something.

709
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:02,669
It's somebody under the couch. Ah.

710
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:09,133
Come out. Come out!

711
00:59:10,912 --> 00:59:12,277
They're gaining.

712
00:59:13,582 --> 00:59:17,848
I'm very much afraid it's the
Queen of Egypt who's hiccupping.

713
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:21,113
Oh, but doesn't that
seem a little absurd? Yes.

714
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,951
I'll stop them for you.

715
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:49,909
Don't you ever have hiccups, Antony?

716
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:53,013
No, not tonight, I don't.

717
00:59:54,623 --> 00:59:57,421
Does it hurt? Oh, no, not a bit.

718
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:01,394
Well, it did it, didn't
it? Oh, yes, it did it.

719
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:05,592
What would happen if you hit me like this?

720
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:07,157
I'd knock your head off.

721
01:00:07,235 --> 01:00:09,726
And it would go rolling
down the deck into the river.

722
01:00:09,805 --> 01:00:11,830
Wouldn't even touch the deck.

723
01:00:14,109 --> 01:00:15,940
You're charming.

724
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:20,638
All right, I'm ready to go now.

725
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:24,382
Why? Oh, you don't find me charming.

726
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:25,818
Yes, I do.

727
01:00:26,988 --> 01:00:30,116
I could fall in love with
you, but I don't intend to.

728
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,958
What for?

729
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:35,961
Do you mean that?

730
01:00:37,165 --> 01:00:39,156
There's no one like you.

731
01:02:56,404 --> 01:02:58,269
Octavian! Octavian!

732
01:02:58,573 --> 01:03:03,067
Hail! Hail, Octavian!
Hail! Hail, Octavian!

733
01:03:03,445 --> 01:03:04,935
Your cheers at last!

734
01:03:07,048 --> 01:03:10,108
And they can only mean that
at last you agree with me...

735
01:03:10,185 --> 01:03:12,119
that Marc Antony is a traitor to Rome.

736
01:03:12,187 --> 01:03:14,781
Antony's a
traitor! A traitor, I tell you!

737
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:19,088
Two months, two long months have
come and gone, and what has happened?

738
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,390
Nothing! Not a thing!

739
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:24,864
Has he attacked Egypt with his legions there?

740
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:26,662
No! No!

741
01:03:27,035 --> 01:03:29,765
Has he brought Cleopatra back in chains?

742
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:32,306
No! No!

743
01:03:32,374 --> 01:03:34,001
Has he done anything?

744
01:03:34,075 --> 01:03:36,475
No. Nothing.

745
01:03:36,811 --> 01:03:39,746
Yes, he's done one thing,
and that completely.

746
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:42,074
He's sailed to Egypt with the Queen...

747
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,846
and lived there ever since
with no thought of Rome.

748
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,478
He's forgotten Rome.

749
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,456
Who is this poisonous
snake that wrecks our men?

750
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,358
Caesar first, and now Antony.

751
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:59,727
When will it end? I'll tell you when!

752
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:02,259
Now! Now!

753
01:04:02,337 --> 01:04:06,933
This time it's my turn. There
will be no more talk of war.

754
01:04:07,008 --> 01:04:09,101
There will be war! War!

755
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:13,509
No more shining words, but shining steel!

756
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:20,052
Rome will be paid with Antony's blood...

757
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:24,990
and the Egyptian snake will be
destroyed, and there shall be war!

758
01:04:25,093 --> 01:04:27,618
War! War! War! War!

759
01:05:13,675 --> 01:05:17,736
What? I never can believe it.

760
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:22,508
What? I should want to leave you right now.

761
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:24,846
Why should you?

762
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:27,687
For a little while, I should.

763
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:32,459
Why? So that you won't tire of me.

764
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:36,691
Aren't you afraid I might tire of you?

765
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:39,891
No.

766
01:05:40,502 --> 01:05:43,630
I should want to go out and
get drunk with a lot of men.

767
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:46,764
Or find another woman.

768
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,478
Well, why don't you?

769
01:05:52,714 --> 01:05:55,148
Because you are another woman.

770
01:05:56,151 --> 01:05:59,086
New. Always new.

771
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:01,816
Completely new.

772
01:06:08,997 --> 01:06:11,989
Majesty! Majesty!

773
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:14,729
Majesty!

774
01:06:14,803 --> 01:06:17,237
What is it?
King Herod has arrived.

775
01:06:17,405 --> 01:06:20,169
Had you forgotten? No, no. Where is he?

776
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:23,938
He's waiting in the audience
chamber. I beg of you. Hurry, Majesty.

777
01:06:24,112 --> 01:06:25,909
Come now, what's the hurry? Oh, please.

778
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:28,039
What do you care for the king of Judea?

779
01:06:28,116 --> 01:06:33,019
But he's my guest. Oh, now, be a good
boy and stop frowning. I have to dress.

780
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:35,420
All right, but kiss me first.

781
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:42,329
Now run along.

782
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:50,362
Welcome.

783
01:06:50,638 --> 01:06:54,233
I hope to renew an old
friendship. I hope so, too.

784
01:06:56,044 --> 01:07:00,174
Well, time has made you older and wiser.

785
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:03,248
And me younger and more beautiful.

786
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:06,910
And any news? News, indeed.

787
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:11,048
I come directly from Rome
on my way to Judea. Ah.

788
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:14,584
Yes, directly from Rome.

789
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:18,088
As a friend and ally of Rome?

790
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:22,000
And as a friend and ally of Egypt.

791
01:07:24,305 --> 01:07:25,602
And the news?

792
01:07:25,673 --> 01:07:27,971
<i>If you'll dismiss your court, I...</i>

793
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:30,308
Charmion.

794
01:07:40,388 --> 01:07:41,855
Well?

795
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,893
For the moment, I'm tongue-tied
before so much beauty.

796
01:07:50,965 --> 01:07:52,830
The news. The news.

797
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:57,497
You go to great length for
the sake of Egypt, don't you?

798
01:07:59,774 --> 01:08:01,401
<i>You know, I...</i>

799
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:05,810
I wonder how far you would go, really.

800
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:09,409
Octavian doesn't like Antony...

801
01:08:09,484 --> 01:08:12,146
but Octavian is in power now.

802
01:08:13,555 --> 01:08:15,489
If Antony were dead...

803
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:20,860
Octavian would be a very
good friend and ally of Egypt.

804
01:08:23,298 --> 01:08:27,098
He told me to give you that message.

805
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:29,264
Oh.

806
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:33,934
I thought you were a friend of Antony.

807
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:37,102
I am. I am.

808
01:08:40,481 --> 01:08:44,474
I always said there was no man in the
world that could drink with Antony...

809
01:08:44,552 --> 01:08:46,349
but not now.

810
01:08:46,588 --> 01:08:48,317
But listen... No, no, no.

811
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:50,721
My friend, when a man is drunk with love...

812
01:08:50,825 --> 01:08:53,885
he can't divide his
concentration with wine, you know.

813
01:08:53,962 --> 01:08:56,795
All major emotions are greedy.

814
01:09:01,536 --> 01:09:04,972
And tell me, my friend, aren't you
happier with her than with a grape?

815
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:06,504
Or anything else.

816
01:09:06,908 --> 01:09:08,000
I'm mad about her.

817
01:09:08,076 --> 01:09:12,570
Of course you are, my boy. Of
course. That reminds me of something.

818
01:09:12,914 --> 01:09:16,782
Something very funny, too, that I
heard recently in Rome from Octavian.

819
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:19,945
Octavian? It must have been funny.

820
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:23,616
It was, Antony. It was.
Listen, this is what he said.

821
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:27,189
If Cleopatra would poison Antony...

822
01:09:27,862 --> 01:09:32,799
Rome would forgive her for everything,
and that would be the salvation for Egypt.

823
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:36,397
Poison me?

824
01:09:36,504 --> 01:09:38,665
Uh-huh. Poison you.

825
01:09:47,348 --> 01:09:51,751
Just imagine, Cleopatra poisoning you.

826
01:09:53,087 --> 01:09:55,351
What did I say? Isn't it funny?

827
01:09:55,456 --> 01:09:58,391
It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.

828
01:09:58,593 --> 01:10:02,461
As if love didn't conquer
all. As if it didn't.

829
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:10,436
Poison me? I can't wait to
tell her! How she'll laugh.

830
01:10:10,538 --> 01:10:12,130
I'll go and tell her. I'll be right back.

831
01:10:12,206 --> 01:10:14,697
Yes, do that, Antony. Do tell her, please.

832
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:16,974
<i>She...</i>

833
01:10:34,128 --> 01:10:36,426
You poison me!

834
01:10:46,674 --> 01:10:49,074
You must for Egypt.

835
01:10:49,744 --> 01:10:51,371
Egypt.

836
01:10:53,581 --> 01:10:56,550
Now you ask me to do murder for Egypt.

837
01:10:59,387 --> 01:11:02,686
I can't. I can't.

838
01:11:03,725 --> 01:11:07,422
It's only one life against
the freedom of your people.

839
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:10,827
You don't love him.

840
01:11:40,061 --> 01:11:41,528
What's your crime?

841
01:11:41,596 --> 01:11:45,760
Murder. I killed my wife
and child while I was drunk.

842
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:48,364
What punishment has been decreed?

843
01:11:48,436 --> 01:11:49,835
Crucifixion.

844
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,762
How long will it take
you to die on the cross?

845
01:11:53,441 --> 01:11:55,739
I am strong, Majesty.

846
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:59,571
Two days. Maybe three.

847
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:02,114
Would you like to die in three seconds?

848
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:06,478
Majesty, you're merciful.

849
01:12:14,595 --> 01:12:16,085
Take this.

850
01:12:17,598 --> 01:12:18,895
Drink it.

851
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,311
Was there any pain?

852
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:39,751
A little, a very little.

853
01:12:39,854 --> 01:12:41,845
There must be no pain.

854
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:49,557
What's this? The Queen is testing poisons.

855
01:13:03,644 --> 01:13:07,978
A wine we've never had before,
dear Antony. I've been saving it.

856
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:09,773
What for?

857
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:12,012
For a night when the mood strikes.

858
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:13,553
I see.

859
01:13:13,788 --> 01:13:15,619
And tonight is that night?

860
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:16,884
Tonight.

861
01:13:18,459 --> 01:13:21,917
Now, can you think of a pretty toast?

862
01:13:21,996 --> 01:13:23,759
It would please me very much.

863
01:13:23,865 --> 01:13:25,594
You're very gay.

864
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:30,934
And you're very solemn. Is there any reason?

865
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:32,438
I'm thinking.

866
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:34,668
Evidently.

867
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:40,107
Well, let's drink first.
Perhaps pretty words will follow.

868
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:48,988
But you don't drink.

869
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:50,421
Neither do you.

870
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,858
I don't wish to drink alone.

871
01:13:53,494 --> 01:13:55,860
And I don't think I wish to drink at all.

872
01:13:57,765 --> 01:13:58,754
Well...

873
01:14:00,668 --> 01:14:03,694
he is in a strange mood tonight.

874
01:14:05,573 --> 01:14:08,974
Now tell me, what's the matter?

875
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:13,873
<i>Oh. For some reason, I've...
I've no thirst tonight.</i>

876
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:19,549
I'd far prefer just to
sit and watch you drink.

877
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:22,950
You really mean that?

878
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:24,821
Yes, I do.

879
01:14:27,194 --> 01:14:31,893
If that's what you prefer, I
always try to please you, Antony.

880
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:03,056
Oh, my dear.

881
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:07,797
The strangest man on the face of the earth.

882
01:15:07,868 --> 01:15:09,927
The happiest man on the face of the earth.

883
01:15:10,404 --> 01:15:12,395
Come on. Let's drink.

884
01:15:15,142 --> 01:15:16,871
Look, Antony. What?

885
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:18,946
The reed birds again.

886
01:15:19,313 --> 01:15:24,080
Not much of a meal for a man. These
things get smaller and smaller.

887
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,619
Do you remember the stars?

888
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:28,985
Yes, and the river.

889
01:15:29,256 --> 01:15:33,420
And the rose. When I put it in
your hair, and you were Cleopatra.

890
01:15:33,494 --> 01:15:35,928
Yes, and I threw it back at you.

891
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:38,124
And I sweetened your wine with it.

892
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:42,359
That was a night.

893
01:15:42,436 --> 01:15:44,427
Let's drink to the river.

894
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:49,042
To the river.

895
01:16:02,223 --> 01:16:03,850
Majesty. What is it?

896
01:16:03,924 --> 01:16:06,017
A carrier pigeon from Rome.

897
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:29,281
Rome has declared war.

898
01:16:30,618 --> 01:16:33,815
War? Let me see that.

899
01:16:35,556 --> 01:16:38,150
Octavian declares me a traitor, eh?

900
01:16:39,093 --> 01:16:40,355
Octavian!

901
01:16:41,295 --> 01:16:43,354
Octavian to meet me!

902
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:48,462
I'm laughing now.

903
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,408
Go get Enobarbus. Send him here.

904
01:16:54,475 --> 01:16:57,273
I take orders only from my Queen. What?

905
01:16:58,779 --> 01:17:01,612
Now, get up and get him!
You keep out of this!

906
01:17:01,716 --> 01:17:05,152
Another word from you, and I'll
smash you to powder. Now, get him!

907
01:17:05,352 --> 01:17:09,083
All Egyptians, eh? I need Roman soldiers now.

908
01:17:09,223 --> 01:17:11,555
You, get my 10 generals
and send them to me at once.

909
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,320
Yes, my lord. Well, jump to it!

910
01:17:13,394 --> 01:17:14,759
Maps. My maps. Yes, lord.

911
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:16,262
You, get my war chests.
Yes, lord.

912
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:19,424
Send carrier pigeons to Ventilius
at Tarsus, Drusus at Athens...

913
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,762
and to my legions in Philippi...

914
01:17:20,835 --> 01:17:23,633
to get under way at once and meet
me and my 10 legions at Actium.

915
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:25,467
Yes, lord. Slaves, bring tables!

916
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:30,107
Yes, and get chairs, chairs for my
generals! I need Roman soldiers now.

917
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:36,582
So I'm a traitor, am I? They'll
take that back on their knees!

918
01:17:38,185 --> 01:17:42,144
And as for you and your Egypt,
take your choice: Rome or Antony?

919
01:17:42,223 --> 01:17:44,418
It's
all the same to Antony.

920
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:49,151
Here, you! All right, set it down.

921
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:57,502
I want galleys tomorrow
morning to transport 10 legions.

922
01:17:57,571 --> 01:17:59,471
Ten legions to Actium. Tomorrow morning?

923
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,132
Manned and equipped for six months' siege.

924
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:03,642
The legions will assemble
under my generals in the square.

925
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:05,269
Tomorrow morning? At dawn.

926
01:18:05,346 --> 01:18:06,370
Now, get out.

927
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:08,176
What answer will you send Octavian?

928
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:09,978
Octavian?

929
01:18:13,387 --> 01:18:15,582
Send that to Octavian!

930
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,492
I'm at war again! No!

931
01:18:21,562 --> 01:18:23,962
Antony! Antony! What's the matter?

932
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:28,566
What is it?

933
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:36,203
At last, I've seen a god come to life.

934
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:40,904
I'm no longer a queen.

935
01:18:41,816 --> 01:18:43,579
I'm a woman.

936
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:52,691
You choose me, Cleopatra, against the world?

937
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,691
Against the world.

938
01:18:54,762 --> 01:18:56,491
Then we'll meet it.

939
01:18:56,597 --> 01:19:00,533
We'll smash it to pieces, put it
together again, and call it ours!

940
01:19:00,968 --> 01:19:02,265
War!

941
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:05,629
Ah, Enobarbus!

942
01:19:06,273 --> 01:19:08,639
Come over here. I've my plans all ready.

943
01:19:08,742 --> 01:19:11,575
A trap that Octavian will
fall into like a little mouse.

944
01:19:11,645 --> 01:19:13,112
There'll be no war.

945
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,747
Why, what's happened? Disaster.

946
01:19:17,818 --> 01:19:19,217
Disaster?

947
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,855
Yes, and for Octavian, complete disaster.

948
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:25,621
Where are my generals?

949
01:19:27,127 --> 01:19:30,824
They're all here, Antony.
And can you blame them?

950
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:35,901
They're Romans. They won't
serve under an Egyptian queen.

951
01:19:36,136 --> 01:19:38,866
They won't
fight for Egypt against Rome.

952
01:19:38,939 --> 01:19:42,033
They have gone. They've
taken their legions with them.

953
01:19:42,443 --> 01:19:47,346
Now they're Octavian's
generals, and you are alone.

954
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:50,379
There'll be no war.

955
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:52,976
There will be war! And
what will you fight with?

956
01:19:53,821 --> 01:19:56,153
The Egyptian army against all of Rome?

957
01:19:56,223 --> 01:19:58,282
If that's all we have
left, we fight with them.

958
01:19:58,359 --> 01:19:59,553
We?

959
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:01,550
What?

960
01:20:07,368 --> 01:20:10,269
I'm not here to fight with the Egyptian army.

961
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:15,174
I'm here to tell you that Rome
is still yours if you want her.

962
01:20:15,843 --> 01:20:18,368
Rome will always love you, Antony.

963
01:20:18,445 --> 01:20:21,437
All that Rome wants is your love in return.

964
01:20:21,882 --> 01:20:24,578
And there's one way to prove that love.

965
01:20:24,785 --> 01:20:27,686
One way, and overnight
Octavian will be forgotten...

966
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:31,282
and Rome will take back to her arms her hero.

967
01:20:31,892 --> 01:20:34,554
One way. Well?

968
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:39,099
Say the word, and I'll plunge
that through a woman's heart.

969
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:44,269
And the report will be that you did it,
and Rome will take you back to her heart.

970
01:20:45,572 --> 01:20:48,200
There's no room in Rome for Octavian and me.

971
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:51,510
You mean, there's not room
enough in your world...

972
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:54,206
for anything else but Cleopatra.

973
01:20:55,015 --> 01:20:58,746
Yes. Yes, that's what I mean. Yes.

974
01:20:59,386 --> 01:21:01,377
That's what you mean.

975
01:21:02,189 --> 01:21:04,714
And you're the man I
once heard say to Caesar:

976
01:21:04,825 --> 01:21:09,353
"They can't think. They can't
fight. They are playthings for us. "

977
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,227
No man can speak to me like that. Get out!

978
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:16,167
I'm getting out, but I'm
taking nothing of yours with me.

979
01:21:21,141 --> 01:21:24,076
There's Brittany back.

980
01:21:25,779 --> 01:21:27,974
And there's the campaign in Syria.

981
01:21:29,683 --> 01:21:32,151
This, you've long forgotten.

982
01:21:33,821 --> 01:21:36,085
When I saved your life.

983
01:21:39,093 --> 01:21:40,788
And this...

984
01:21:43,397 --> 01:21:45,228
when you saved mine.

985
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:48,296
And this... Put them back!

986
01:21:48,369 --> 01:21:49,631
No!

987
01:21:50,337 --> 01:21:53,829
Our long campaign together lies
with the plans on the floor.

988
01:21:57,011 --> 01:21:58,603
The war goes on.

989
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:01,572
Is that all you have to say?

990
01:22:01,648 --> 01:22:03,513
That's all.

991
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:05,543
Well.

992
01:22:06,286 --> 01:22:08,914
Goodbye, Antony.

993
01:22:08,989 --> 01:22:12,152
You, who might have been
the world's great man...

994
01:22:12,226 --> 01:22:14,217
ends all for a woman.

995
01:22:14,428 --> 01:22:17,090
For that, I give you the world's contempt.

996
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:20,397
But for what you might have been...

997
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:24,131
I give you my last salute.

998
01:22:58,939 --> 01:23:02,340
So Rome would forgive and take you back?

999
01:23:03,844 --> 01:23:07,473
And all they demand is for us to part.

1000
01:23:09,183 --> 01:23:12,880
Why don't they ask the sun
to fall right out of the sky?

1001
01:23:14,888 --> 01:23:18,085
Yes, we'll fight them.

1002
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:23,292
We'll fight them all if
we have to fight alone.

1003
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:49,418
Forward march!

1004
01:24:58,559 --> 01:25:00,083
Watch the cavalry!

1005
01:26:32,919 --> 01:26:34,409
Burn the boats! On fire!

1006
01:27:36,983 --> 01:27:38,712
So you've got it all, eh?

1007
01:27:38,785 --> 01:27:43,154
All my generals, all my
legions, all the Egyptians.

1008
01:27:43,657 --> 01:27:48,060
Everything I had on land and sea,
you've lured and brought away.

1009
01:27:48,328 --> 01:27:51,764
You've got it all. You've
got it all except me!

1010
01:27:51,832 --> 01:27:53,390
Come down and surrender.

1011
01:27:53,467 --> 01:27:55,128
You come up and get me!

1012
01:27:55,369 --> 01:27:58,736
Words. He fights to the last with words.

1013
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:02,969
Words. All right, you listen to them.
I'll come down and fight you alone!

1014
01:28:03,076 --> 01:28:05,772
I can think of easier ways for you to die.

1015
01:28:05,912 --> 01:28:09,279
Well, if you're afraid,
I'll fight the lot of you.

1016
01:28:09,683 --> 01:28:12,311
One by one. Two by two.

1017
01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:15,378
And if that bores me, I'll
fight you three by three!

1018
01:28:15,455 --> 01:28:18,390
You've forgotten how
to fight! You've lost your army!

1019
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:24,357
And if I decide to grant your request
and choose to be the first you meet...

1020
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:26,922
what's the prize? The Egyptian Queen?

1021
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:32,797
Wait! Shut up!

1022
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,706
The Egyptian Queen is no man's prize.

1023
01:28:35,876 --> 01:28:39,607
She is a warrior of her
own and fights by my side.

1024
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:42,079
Closer to the wall. Closer to the wall.

1025
01:28:47,354 --> 01:28:48,753
It's coming down.

1026
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:52,019
Don't lower that bridge,
you fools! Put it up!

1027
01:28:52,092 --> 01:28:54,458
Closer to the bridge. He mustn't see us.

1028
01:28:58,832 --> 01:29:00,800
Put it up again, I say!

1029
01:29:00,867 --> 01:29:03,631
Majesty, did you see him on the wall?

1030
01:29:04,204 --> 01:29:07,230
He looked so... Oh, can't I tell him?

1031
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:10,640
No! No. He wouldn't
believe I could help him...

1032
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:14,840
but it's our last chance.
I've got to take it.

1033
01:29:15,048 --> 01:29:16,174
Forward.

1034
01:29:16,716 --> 01:29:19,776
Look, somebody's coming out.
Can you see who it is?

1035
01:29:19,853 --> 01:29:22,447
The olive branch! They're
carrying the olive branch.

1036
01:29:22,522 --> 01:29:23,614
The Queen of Egypt!

1037
01:29:24,124 --> 01:29:27,287
Look. Cleopatra. It is the Queen!

1038
01:29:31,431 --> 01:29:33,092
Cleopatra surrenders!

1039
01:29:37,103 --> 01:29:39,230
Cleopatra.

1040
01:29:40,373 --> 01:29:43,809
Come back. Come back.

1041
01:29:45,545 --> 01:29:48,139
Come back! Come back!

1042
01:29:52,686 --> 01:29:54,711
He couldn't even keep her!

1043
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:02,053
She's a warrior, all
right, but she fights by our side!

1044
01:30:03,697 --> 01:30:05,790
Jump, Antony! Jump!

1045
01:30:09,302 --> 01:30:12,294
All you've got left now is the wall!

1046
01:30:15,108 --> 01:30:16,939
He can't keep his woman.

1047
01:30:19,179 --> 01:30:22,842
Where you going?
What's your hurry?

1048
01:30:44,905 --> 01:30:47,635
Wine. Bring me wine.

1049
01:30:57,484 --> 01:31:01,011
Look, this is Antony the Roman leader.

1050
01:31:02,822 --> 01:31:05,689
This is Antony at the square in Tarsus.

1051
01:31:05,892 --> 01:31:10,795
To send the woman back in chains,
then on to Egypt with marching men!

1052
01:31:12,799 --> 01:31:14,426
Here's to Antony!

1053
01:31:17,837 --> 01:31:18,963
My lord, can I...

1054
01:31:20,507 --> 01:31:21,906
Get out.

1055
01:31:25,879 --> 01:31:28,677
But Tarsus isn't here it seems.

1056
01:31:29,983 --> 01:31:33,077
Instead, a couch.

1057
01:31:36,523 --> 01:31:38,150
A couch to lie on.

1058
01:31:38,825 --> 01:31:42,124
A woman to give your
arms to instead of chains.

1059
01:31:42,929 --> 01:31:45,329
Antony, who can't think or fight.

1060
01:31:45,432 --> 01:31:47,662
Antony, the plaything of a woman!

1061
01:32:00,113 --> 01:32:02,081
And there is Egypt.

1062
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:04,749
Yours.

1063
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:08,583
All I ask is to save his life.

1064
01:32:11,057 --> 01:32:14,493
Spare him, and I promise
you'll never see him again.

1065
01:32:15,295 --> 01:32:17,695
I shall take him away, far up the Nile...

1066
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:24,366
and leave with you Egypt.

1067
01:32:32,712 --> 01:32:35,806
I suppose of all the requests
that have ever been made...

1068
01:32:35,882 --> 01:32:38,214
yours is the most hopeless.

1069
01:32:40,253 --> 01:32:43,780
Spare Antony's life? I'd
sooner be dead myself.

1070
01:32:45,025 --> 01:32:49,587
And as for you, this time you
do go back to Rome in chains.

1071
01:32:49,663 --> 01:32:51,654
This time you face a man!

1072
01:32:51,998 --> 01:32:53,295
Take her away.

1073
01:32:53,366 --> 01:32:58,201
We can't do that, Excellence.
She came bearing the olive branch.

1074
01:32:59,005 --> 01:33:03,066
What's the difference? We've
only to smash the city's gates.

1075
01:33:03,176 --> 01:33:06,612
Oh, we'll smash the city's gates, all right.

1076
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,648
But she must have safe conduct back.

1077
01:33:09,482 --> 01:33:11,177
We are Romans.

1078
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:12,877
Oh, all right.

1079
01:33:14,654 --> 01:33:17,122
Go back and kiss him goodbye.

1080
01:33:20,827 --> 01:33:23,057
Thank you, soldier.

1081
01:33:30,403 --> 01:33:33,201
When you smash the gates...

1082
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:36,003
you had better come in behind your men.

1083
01:33:46,786 --> 01:33:49,721
I failed, but there's still a way out for us.

1084
01:33:49,789 --> 01:33:52,189
I have horses waiting beyond
the passage to the tombs...

1085
01:33:52,258 --> 01:33:55,352
and a boat with trusted rowers
will take us to the upper Nile.

1086
01:33:55,428 --> 01:33:58,454
Antony, we can lose ourselves
there and still be happy.

1087
01:33:58,531 --> 01:33:59,896
Antony, listen.

1088
01:34:00,967 --> 01:34:03,299
I never wanted to see you again.

1089
01:34:06,706 --> 01:34:09,800
How deep does a man have to stab to die?

1090
01:34:09,876 --> 01:34:11,434
Antony!

1091
01:34:12,212 --> 01:34:14,476
Antony, what... No, no more Antony!

1092
01:34:15,081 --> 01:34:18,949
Antony's gone. You go back to Octavian.

1093
01:34:19,385 --> 01:34:21,114
He's the Caesar now.

1094
01:34:22,122 --> 01:34:24,249
You thought I went to him?

1095
01:34:24,724 --> 01:34:27,921
You... You thought that of me? Am I blind?

1096
01:34:27,994 --> 01:34:31,896
I went for your sake. I
went to plead for your life.

1097
01:34:32,499 --> 01:34:34,296
To plead, Antony.

1098
01:34:36,069 --> 01:34:39,197
I was pleading for your
life, and you were taking it.

1099
01:34:39,572 --> 01:34:41,062
Antony.

1100
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:44,343
I am blind indeed.

1101
01:34:46,146 --> 01:34:47,977
I am dying, Egypt.

1102
01:34:48,915 --> 01:34:50,348
Dying.

1103
01:34:51,785 --> 01:34:55,050
Listen. There's little time.

1104
01:34:57,423 --> 01:35:02,156
Away from war in upper Egypt with
you would have been very sweet...

1105
01:35:02,729 --> 01:35:06,062
but this, this is a better end.

1106
01:35:06,733 --> 01:35:09,224
A Roman by a Roman conquered.

1107
01:35:10,136 --> 01:35:12,696
No, no, no. Don't pity me. Don't pity me.

1108
01:35:13,239 --> 01:35:15,434
We were born for war.

1109
01:35:15,942 --> 01:35:20,436
It was the soul of our love, and
we part at the top of our glory.

1110
01:35:22,448 --> 01:35:26,782
My precious Cleopatra, I'm happy.

1111
01:35:28,588 --> 01:35:30,852
The end is in your arms.

1112
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,615
My love.

1113
01:35:35,962 --> 01:35:38,931
Take me away with you into the shadows...

1114
01:35:39,365 --> 01:35:43,495
as close as if you could
carry me in your arms.

1115
01:35:43,803 --> 01:35:48,570
I am taking you with me,
Egypt. I am taking you with me.

1116
01:35:49,642 --> 01:35:51,007
Forever.

1117
01:35:55,882 --> 01:35:57,440
Antony.

1118
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:25,469
Hurry, Majesty. Hurry! They're at the doors.

1119
01:36:35,889 --> 01:36:37,686
Prepare me.

1120
01:36:39,826 --> 01:36:43,489
The Queen of Egypt goes
to meet the conqueror.

1121
01:36:55,108 --> 01:36:56,769
The doors are breaking.

1122
01:36:57,477 --> 01:37:02,312
Royal Egypt, let me die before I see
you go to Rome in chains, defeated.

1123
01:37:04,918 --> 01:37:07,978
I'm not going to Rome, Charmion.

1124
01:37:13,793 --> 01:37:15,886
Now, give me the basket.

1125
01:37:19,098 --> 01:37:21,032
It holds victory.

1126
01:37:49,762 --> 01:37:50,751
It works.

1127
01:37:59,072 --> 01:38:01,165
Little Iras.

1128
01:38:02,942 --> 01:38:04,239
Charmion.

1129
01:38:05,078 --> 01:38:07,069
Look well for love.

1130
01:38:09,716 --> 01:38:11,240
Look well.

1131
01:38:13,586 --> 01:38:17,682
And not finding it, give nothing.

1132
01:38:21,661 --> 01:38:24,994
But if blessed with Cleopatra's fortune...

1133
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:28,557
give all.

1134
01:38:31,037 --> 01:38:32,299
Now, go.
