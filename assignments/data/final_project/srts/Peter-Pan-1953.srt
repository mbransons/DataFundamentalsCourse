1
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,274
The second star to the right

2
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:50,984
Shines in the night for you

3
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:54,306
To tell you that the dreams you plan

4
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:58,468
Really can come true

5
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:01,228
The second star to the right

6
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:05,593
Shines with a light so rare

7
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:09,429
And if it's Never Land you need

8
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:13,394
Its light will lead you there

9
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:16,228
Twinkle, twinkle little star

10
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:20,308
So we'll know where you are

11
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:24,229
Gleaming in the skies above

12
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:26,909
Lead us to the land

13
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:31,273
We dream of

14
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:35,394
And when ourjourney is through

15
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:37,989
Each time we say

16
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,908
Good night

17
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:46,513
We'll thank the little star
that shines

18
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:51,673
The second from

19
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:55,065
The right

20
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:01,510
All this has happened before.

21
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:04,587
And it will all happen again.

22
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:07,553
But this time
it happened in London.

23
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:14,393
It happened on a quiet street
in Bloomsbury.

24
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:19,105
That corner house over there is
the home of the Darling family.

25
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:21,584
And Peter Pan chose
this particular house...

26
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,190
because there were people
here who believed in him.

27
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:28,506
There was Mrs Darling.

28
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:32,429
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't
be late for the party, you know.

29
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:36,827
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan
was the spirit of youth.

30
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:40,703
- But Mr Darling--
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links...

31
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:42,831
we don't go to the party.

32
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:46,908
And if we don't go to the party, I can
never show my face in the office again.

33
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,826
And if I can never-- Ouch!

34
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:52,624
Well, Mr Darling
was a practical man.

35
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,832
The boys, however,
John and Michael...

36
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:58,224
believed Peter Pan
was a real person...

37
00:02:58,315 --> 00:03:01,785
and made him the hero
of all their nursery games.

38
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,831
Blast you, Peter Pan!

39
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:09,350
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?

40
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:12,427
Never! I'll teach you
to cut off me hand!

41
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:15,712
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.

42
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,831
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.

43
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:21,794
Wendy, the eldest,
not only believed...

44
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,343
she was the supreme authority
on Peter Pan...

45
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:26,266
and all his
marvellous adventures.

46
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:29,950
Oh, Nana, must we always
take that nasty tonic?

47
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:33,232
Nana, the nursemaid,
being a dog...

48
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:35,704
kept her opinions to herself...

49
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:39,151
and viewed the whole affair
with a certain tolerance.

50
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,388
Take that!

51
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:50,627
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!

52
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:53,428
And I'll cut you to pieces.

53
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:55,904
- Aha!
- Ouch!

54
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:59,908
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry,John.

55
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:02,384
You'll never leave
this ship alive!

56
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,831
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!

57
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:15,269
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.

58
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,107
Oh, no, you won't.

59
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:20,346
Back, back, back, you villain!

60
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:23,552
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!

61
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:28,231
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either.
You never touched me.

62
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:31,910
Take that and that!
And that!

63
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,111
Boys, boys,
less noise, please.

64
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:39,873
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.

65
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:42,344
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael--

66
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:46,030
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.

67
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:48,993
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.

68
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,635
Uh, have you seen my cuff--

69
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,513
Oh, Nana,
for goodness sake!

70
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,155
Where are those cuff links?

71
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:01,387
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.

72
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:04,512
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?

73
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,631
- I don't know.
- The map then.

74
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:09,627
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.

75
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:12,787
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!

76
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,343
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.

77
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:18,586
And hereafter--
Don't paw me, Michael.

78
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:23,703
This is my last clean--
No! No!

79
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:26,434
George, dear, we really must
hurry or we'll be late--

80
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:30,110
- Mary, look!
- George.

81
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,312
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.

82
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:36,193
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.

83
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:39,267
- And Wendy says--
- Wendy? Story?

84
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:43,906
I might have known. Wendy!

85
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,668
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?

86
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:49,713
- Would you kindly ex--
- Oh, Mother!

87
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:52,832
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.

88
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:55,065
- Wendy.
-Just my old gown made over.

89
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,431
- But it did turn out
rather nicely, didn't--
- Mary, if you don't mind.

90
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:02,190
- I'd like--
- Why, Father, what have
you done to your shirt?

91
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:06,029
What have I-- Oh!

92
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:10,791
- Now, George, really.
It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.

93
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,710
Wendy, haven't I warned you?
Stuffing the boys' heads
with a lot of silly stories.

94
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:18,514
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.

95
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,984
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!

96
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:25,353
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!

97
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:27,391
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you--
- Oh, you don't understand.

98
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:32,071
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous--

99
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:35,591
- Now, George.
- ""Now, George.''

100
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,711
""Now, George''!

101
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,434
Well, ""Now, George,''
will have his say!

102
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:44,508
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.

103
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,825
It's high time she had
a room of her own.

104
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:49,145
- Father!
- George!
- What?

105
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:52,227
- No!
- I mean it!

106
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:55,864
Young lady, this is your
last night in the nursery.

107
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:58,913
And that's my last word
on the matter--

108
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:13,750
No!

109
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,148
No!

110
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:28,031
Oh!

111
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,310
Poor Nana.

112
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:34,864
""Poor Nana''?

113
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,150
This is the last straw!

114
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,465
Out! Out, I say!

115
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:42,353
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!

116
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:45,393
There'll be no more dogs
for nursemaids in this house!

117
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,427
Goodbye, Nana.

118
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:54,234
""Poor Nana.''
Oh, yes, ""Poor Nana.''

119
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:58,103
But ""Poor Father''?
Oh, no!

120
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,584
Blast it!
Where is that rope?

121
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,753
Oh, thank you.

122
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,353
Dash it all, Nana,
don't look at me like that.

123
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:13,710
It's nothing personal.
It's just that--

124
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,986
Well, you're not really
a nurse at all.

125
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:20,033
You're, well, a dog.

126
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,073
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.

127
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:27,068
And sooner or later, Nana,
people have to grow up.

128
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:29,953
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.

129
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:34,108
Now, dear, don't worry
about it any more tonight.

130
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:37,949
He called Peter Pan
""absolute poppycock.''

131
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:42,586
I'm sure he didn't mean it,John.
Father was just upset.

132
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:47,146
Poor Nana,
out there all alone.

133
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,147
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.

134
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,351
She'll be all right.

135
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:55,074
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?

136
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:58,830
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.

137
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,383
Don't judge your father
too harshly.

138
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,627
After all, he really
loves you very much.

139
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:08,229
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.

140
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,830
- ""He''?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.

141
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:15,828
You see, I found something
that belongs to him.

142
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:19,544
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.

143
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:22,945
- ""Shadow''?
- Mmm, Nana had it.

144
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:25,947
But I--
I took it away.

145
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:32,185
Oh? Yes, of course.

146
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,505
Good night, dear.

147
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:40,350
But, George, do you think the children
will be safe without Nana?

148
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,630
Safe? Of course
they'll be safe. Why not?

149
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,946
Well, Wendy said something
about a shadow, and I--

150
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,708
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.

151
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:52,231
Oh, Peter Pan--
Peter Pan!

152
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:56,866
You don't say. Goodness gracious,
whatever shall we do?

153
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,911
- But, George-- Really, I--
- Sound the alarm!

154
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:01,714
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.

155
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:05,071
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible,
childish fiddle-faddle.

156
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:09,627
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the
children to grow up and be practical...

157
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:12,070
- George, dear.
- when you're as bad as they are.

158
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:14,908
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets
these idiotic ideas.

159
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:47,145
Over there, Tink,
in its den.

160
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:49,954
Is it there?

161
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,945
Must be here somewhere.

162
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,949
Tink! Shh!

163
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,948
Stop playing
and help me find my shadow.

164
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:09,072
Shadow. Oh, shadow.

165
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:37,154
Huh?

166
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,028
Aha!

167
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:09,194
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!

168
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,551
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.

169
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:14,626
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.

170
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:17,275
You know, you look exactly
the way I thought you would.

171
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:19,949
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then--

172
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:22,913
Oh, you can't stick it
on with soap, Peter.

173
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:25,793
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.

174
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,184
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.

175
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:32,268
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean.
Of course, I knew it was
your shadow the minute I saw it.

176
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:35,472
And I said to myself, I said, ""I'll
put it away for him until he comes back.

177
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:39,389
Oh, he's sure to come back.''
And you did, didn't you, Peter?

178
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:43,434
After all, one can't
leave his shadow lying about
and not miss it sooner or later.

179
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:48,509
Uh, don't you agree? But what
I still don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.

180
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:51,553
She really isn't-- Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.

181
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:54,513
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.

182
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:56,870
- Although Father says--
- Girls talk too much.

183
00:12:56,955 --> 00:13:00,345
Yes, girls talk too--
Hmm? Oh.

184
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,905
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.

185
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:06,907
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl--
- Wendy's enough.

186
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,510
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?

187
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:13,155
Jumped at me the other night
at the window.

188
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:14,748
Well, what were
you doing there?

189
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,669
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?

190
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,985
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.

191
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:24,226
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.

192
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:27,068
The Lost Boys--
Oh, I remember.

193
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,873
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:32,834
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.

195
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:35,224
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.

196
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,387
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night
in the nursery.

197
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:41,308
But that means
no more stories.

198
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:43,784
- Mm-hmm.
- No!

199
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,945
I won't have it.
Come on!

200
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,026
Bu-Bu-But
where are we going?

201
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:50,913
To Never Land.

202
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:53,668
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.

203
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:58,033
Oh, Peter,
it will be so wonderful.

204
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:01,551
But wait.
What would Mother say?

205
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:03,466
Mother? What's Mother?

206
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:08,390
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who--
who loves and cares for you.

207
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:11,751
- And-- And tells you stories--
- Good! You can be our mother.

208
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,666
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I--

209
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:15,985
Let me see now.
I-I have to pack.

210
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:19,147
Oh, and I must leave
a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.

211
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:22,272
And then I'll have to--
Oh, but Never Land.

212
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,915
Oh, I--
I-I'm so happy I--

213
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:28,510
I think I'll give you a-- a kiss.

214
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:32,986
What's a-- a kiss?

215
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:36,431
Oh, well, uh,
I-I'll show you.

216
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:38,471
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!

217
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:46,427
John,John, wake up!
He's here.

218
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:50,144
Huh? Jiminy!

219
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:52,430
Ooh, what in the world was that?

220
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,745
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.

221
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:57,030
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.

222
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:59,709
And my name is John.
How do you do?

223
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:02,673
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.

224
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:05,030
- A pixie.
- Amazing!

225
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:10,434
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.

226
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:13,393
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.

227
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,705
Oh. Well, I think
she's lovely.

228
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:23,352
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?

229
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,551
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!

230
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:27,546
- Peter's taking us.
- ""Us''?

231
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,911
Well, of course. I-I couldn't
go without Michael and John.

232
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:34,590
Oh, I should like very much to cross
swords with some real buccaneers.

233
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:38,588
Yes, and fight pirates too.

234
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:41,633
Well, all right,
but ya gotta take orders.

235
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:44,024
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.

236
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,590
But, Peter, how do
we get to Never Land?

237
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:49,314
- Fly, of course.
- ""Fly''?

238
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:53,786
It's easy. All you
have to do is to-- is to--

239
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,753
Is to--

240
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:59,554
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?

241
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,626
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.

242
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:04,991
It's-- It's just that
I never thought about it before.

243
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:08,385
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.

244
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:11,114
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.

245
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:14,267
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?

246
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,869
Yep! Watch me now.
Here I go!

247
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:20,549
It's easier than pie.

248
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:23,229
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

249
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,829
He flewed!

250
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:29,988
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon...

251
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:33,463
underneath a magic moon.

252
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:35,750
I'll think I'm
in a pirate's cave.

253
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:37,666
I think I'll be
an Indian brave.

254
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,586
Now everybody try.

255
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:42,826
One, two, three!

256
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:46,669
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!

257
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,903
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?

258
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:59,305
All it takes
is faith and trust.

259
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:03,183
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!

260
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,835
- Dust?
- Dust?

261
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:10,909
Yep, just a little bit
of pixie dust.

262
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:19,072
Now, think of
the happiest things.

263
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:22,352
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.

264
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,551
Look! We're rising off the floor.

265
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:28,230
-Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!

266
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:32,547
- You can fly!
- We can fly!

267
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:37,033
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!

268
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:38,468
Off to Never Land!

269
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:47,108
Think of a wonderful thought

270
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:49,789
Any merry little thought

271
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,105
Think of Christmas
Think of snow

272
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:56,825
Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky

273
00:17:56,915 --> 00:18:00,988
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

274
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,033
Think of the happiest things

275
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,675
It's the same as having wings

276
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,905
Take the path that moonbeams make

277
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:14,194
If the moon is still awake
you'll see him wink his eye

278
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:17,950
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

279
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:21,146
Up you go with a heigh and ho

280
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,351
To the stars beyond the blue

281
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,905
There's a Never Land
waiting for you

282
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:31,432
Where all your
happy dreams come true

283
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:36,828
Every dream that you dream
will come true

284
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,031
Come on, Nana!

285
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:42,471
When there's a smile
in your heart

286
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:47,913
There's no better time to start

287
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,145
Think of all thejoy you'll find

288
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:55,025
When you leave the world behind
and bid your cares goodbye

289
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:58,152
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly

290
00:18:58,235 --> 00:19:00,510
You can fly

291
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:13,388
There it is, Wendy. Second star to
the right and straight on till morning.

292
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,027
When there's
a smile in your heart

293
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:23,393
There's no better time to start

294
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:29,023
Think of all thejoy you'll find
when you leave the world behind

295
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:32,585
And bid your cares goodbye

296
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:35,747
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly

297
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:38,269
You can fly

298
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:40,869
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

299
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:57,868
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

300
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:01,630
A-rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer

301
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:04,866
It's the life
of a pirate for me, oh

302
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,344
The life of a pirate for me

303
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:12,304
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

304
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:14,192
They never bury your bones

305
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:17,950
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover
drops in on his friend, Davy Jones

306
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:22,108
Oh, my good friend
Davy Jones

307
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:27,223
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?

308
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:31,547
Here we are, collecting barnacles
on this miserable island.

309
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:35,310
While his nibs plays
ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.

310
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:37,113
Look out. It might go off.

311
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,346
We ought to be tending to
the business of looting ships.

312
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:44,713
Why, I've almost forgotten
how to slit a throat.

313
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:47,593
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain...

314
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:50,269
we wants to put to sea, see?

315
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:56,426
Peter Pan--

316
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:01,866
Blast that Peter Pan!

317
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:05,948
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.

318
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:08,026
But where is it?

319
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,583
Mermaid Lagoon?

320
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:13,473
No, we've searched that.

321
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:17,070
We've combed Cannibal Cove.

322
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:20,067
H-Here! No. No, no, no!

323
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,352
That's Indian terri--

324
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:25,266
But wait.

325
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:30,031
Those redskins know this island
better than I do me own ship.

326
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:31,946
Ah...

327
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:34,754
I wonder.

328
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,303
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!

329
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:39,067
Tiger Lily, Smee!

330
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:41,464
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?

331
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:45,309
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.

332
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:48,273
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?

333
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:52,667
Oh, a little persuasion
might be in order.

334
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,871
Now let me see.

335
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:57,788
Boiling in oil?

336
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,754
Keelhauling? Marooning?

337
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:06,113
A pirate's life
is a wonderful l-life

338
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:10,268
You'll find adventure and sport

339
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:13,950
But live every minute
for all that is in it

340
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:19,393
The life of a pirate is short

341
00:22:19,475 --> 00:22:24,026
Oh, the life--

342
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,792
Now let me see, where was I?

343
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,070
Oh, dear, dear,
dear Captain Hook.

344
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:37,272
Shooting a man in
the middle of his cadenza?

345
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,710
It ain't good form, you know.

346
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:44,073
""Good form,'' Mr Smee?
Blast good form!

347
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,830
Did Pan show good form
when he did this to me?

348
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:52,431
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was
only a childish prank, you might say.

349
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:55,552
Aye! But throwing it
to the crocodile!

350
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:58,513
That cursed beast liked
the taste of me so well...

351
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:01,951
he's followed me ever since,
licking his chops...

352
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:04,549
for the rest of me.

353
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,910
And he'd have had
you by now, Captain...

354
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:09,304
if he hadn't swallowed
that alarm clock.

355
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:13,752
But now when he's about, he warns ya
as ya might say with his tick-tock...

356
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,791
tick-tock, tick-tock.

357
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:47,905
Smee? Smee!

358
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:49,986
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!

359
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:53,226
Please, don't let him
get me, Smee! Smee!

360
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:56,671
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.

361
00:23:56,755 --> 00:23:59,394
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!

362
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:02,785
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.

363
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:10,351
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.

364
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:13,347
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.

365
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,710
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.

366
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:19,071
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.

367
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:21,510
What you need is a shave.

368
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:26,111
A nice soothing shave.
There now.

369
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:29,671
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

370
00:24:29,755 --> 00:24:32,952
A-sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a--

371
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:35,595
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'...

372
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:40,066
you just ain't been
your usual jolly self of late.

373
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,066
Give me a career as a buccaneer

374
00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:44,544
And the crew's gettin'
a might uneasy, Captain.

375
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:46,865
That is,
what's left of it.

376
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:53,310
Now, why don't we put
to sea, see? Leave Never Land.

377
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:57,149
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!

378
00:24:57,235 --> 00:24:59,544
Give me a career as a buccaneer

379
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:03,423
We'd all be a lot happier,
not to mention a lot healthier.

380
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:11,828
Captain? Oh, dear! I never
shaved him this close before.

381
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:18,990
Now, don't worry, Captain.
I-It must be somewhere about.

382
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:22,789
Get up, you idiot!

383
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,230
Aye, aye, sir.

384
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:28,989
Ooh! I found it, Captain.

385
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:32,829
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!

386
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:36,749
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?

387
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,066
Three points off
the starboard bow!

388
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:42,589
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!

389
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,747
Headed this way with
some more of those scurvy brats!

390
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,746
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!

391
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:50,429
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up
the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.

392
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,029
All hands on deck!

393
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:55,709
All hands on deck!

394
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:57,706
All hands on deck!

395
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,306
All hands on deck!

396
00:26:03,635 --> 00:26:06,024
Look alive, you swabs!

397
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:09,790
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.

398
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:13,914
Man the Long Tom,
you bilge rats!

399
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:17,271
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin'
the holidays either.

400
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:19,550
Double the powder
and shorten the fuse!

401
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:21,785
Shorten the powder
and double the fuse!

402
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:22,910
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.

403
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:25,463
We'll pot 'em
like sitting ducks.

404
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:29,628
- All right, men! Range 42.
- ""Range 42.''

405
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,991
- Elevation 65.
- ""Elevation 65.''

406
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,714
- Three degrees west.
- ""Three degrees west.''

407
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:40,915
Steady now! Steady!

408
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:44,670
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.

409
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:47,110
Oh, look,John,
there's Mermaid Lagoon.

410
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:51,871
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!

411
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:54,913
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.

412
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:59,865
Look out!

413
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:03,785
Quick, Tink, take Wendy
and the boys to the island.

414
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:07,106
I'll stay here
and draw Hook's fire.

415
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:12,508
Hook! Hook!
You codfish! Here!

416
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:23,034
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.

417
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,868
We can't keep up with you.

418
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:28,992
Tinker Bell! Wait!

419
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:51,914
Ouch!

420
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,394
So!

421
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:01,033
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!

422
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:03,390
I'll show you!

423
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:11,594
Huh? Orders from Pan?

424
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:14,508
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?

425
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:19,870
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.
- ""Wendy Bird''?

426
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:23,630
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are--

427
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:26,183
What? Smash it?

428
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:28,505
- Kick it?
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?

429
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,869
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!
- Yeah!

430
00:28:32,955 --> 00:28:35,230
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!
- Follow Tink!

431
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:38,751
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!

432
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:57,303
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!

433
00:28:57,395 --> 00:29:00,705
Ready, aim...

434
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:02,626
fire!

435
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:17,789
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.

436
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:23,145
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.

437
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:26,113
Good heavens, Wendy,
you might have been killed.

438
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:30,586
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!

439
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:36,384
- Hey, Pan, I got it
with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!

440
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:39,547
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!

441
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:44,785
Attention! Well...

442
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:49,027
I'm certainly proud of you,
you blockheads!

443
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:52,994
- I bring ya a mother
to tell ya stories--
- A mother?

444
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:57,227
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!

445
00:29:57,315 --> 00:30:01,831
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said
to shoot it down!

446
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:05,874
Tinker Bell. Tink!

447
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:10,904
Come here. You're charged
with high treason, Tink.

448
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:14,624
Are you guilty or not guilty?

449
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:18,105
Guilty? But don't ya know
ya might have killed her?

450
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:22,869
Tinker Bell!

451
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:27,073
I hereby banish you forever.

452
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:29,544
Please, not forever.

453
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:33,389
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.

454
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:36,114
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?

455
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:38,834
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?

456
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:40,746
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.

457
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,385
Personally, I should prefer
to see the aborigines.

458
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:46,547
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!

459
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:49,195
Go out and capture
a few Indians.

460
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:53,109
-John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.

461
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:55,072
Forward! March!

462
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:01,309
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.

463
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:03,704
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

464
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:13,152
Following the leader
The leader, the leader

465
00:31:13,235 --> 00:31:16,750
We're following the leader
wherever he may go

466
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:20,066
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day

467
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:23,750
Tee dum, tee dee
It's part of the game we play

468
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:26,952
Tee dum, tee dee
The words are easy to say

469
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:30,630
Just a teedle ee dum
a teedle ee do tee day

470
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:34,344
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee dum

471
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:37,711
We're one for all
and all of us out for fun

472
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,912
We march in line
and follow the other one

473
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:43,873
With a teedle ee do
A teedle ee di tee dum

474
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:02,426
Following the leader
The leader, the leader

475
00:32:02,515 --> 00:32:06,064
We're following the leader
wherever he may go

476
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:09,545
We're out to fight the Injuns
The Injuns, the Injuns

477
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:12,991
We're out to fight the Injuns
because he told us so

478
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:16,590
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day

479
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:20,111
We march along and
these are the words we say

480
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:23,073
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day

481
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:26,830
Oh, a teedle dee dum
A teedle ee do tee day

482
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:30,225
Oh, a teedle ee dum
A teedle ee do tee day

483
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:34,467
Indians!
Oh, Blackfoot tribe.

484
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:38,908
Belongs to the Algonquin group.

485
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,304
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.

486
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:44,705
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

487
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:48,191
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?

488
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:53,429
A plan of attack. The initial phase
is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!

489
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:23,914
John! Indians! Indians!

490
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:26,190
Let me in!

491
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,951
Now remember,
the Indian is cunning...

492
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:33,071
- Hey--
- but not intelligent.

493
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:36,431
Therefore, we simply surround them
and take them by surprise--

494
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:10,590
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.

495
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:14,554
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.

496
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,227
That's okay.

497
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:23,272
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief!
- How!

498
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:27,633
For many moons red man
fight paleface Lost Boys.

499
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:31,071
- Ugh.
- Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.

500
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:34,147
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.

501
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:37,033
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.

502
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:40,266
""Turn us loose''?
You mean this is only a game?

503
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:42,425
Sure! When we win,
we turn them loose.

504
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,551
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.

505
00:34:44,635 --> 00:34:47,069
This time, no turn 'em loose.

506
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:48,986
- Huh?
- Huh?

507
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:52,624
- The Chief's a great spoofer.
- Me no spoof'em.

508
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,990
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?

509
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:59,546
- Uh, Tiger Lily?
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.

510
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:03,708
- Me neither.
- Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.

511
00:35:03,795 --> 00:35:07,504
If Tiger Lily
not back by sunset...

512
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:10,905
burn 'em at stake.

513
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:32,823
Just imagine,
real live mermaids.

514
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:35,668
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.

515
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:37,746
All right, come on.

516
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:43,230
- It's Peter.
- Oh!
- Hello, Peter!

517
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,909
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello!

518
00:35:45,995 --> 00:35:48,031
Hello, Peter!

519
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:54,232
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.

520
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:58,593
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?

521
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:01,667
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.

522
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:04,906
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand
and threw it to the crocodile?

523
00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:08,465
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.

524
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:11,115
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...

525
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:13,470
- Oh, Peter!
- by 40 or 50 pirates.
- Who's she?

526
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:16,945
Huh? Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.

527
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:19,469
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?

528
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,274
And in her nightdress too.

529
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:25,153
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.

530
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:27,226
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!

531
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:28,987
- We insist!
- No, no, please!

532
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:32,829
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!

533
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,909
- If you dare to come near me again--
- Wendy! Wendy!

534
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:45,634
They were just having a little fun,
weren't you, girls?

535
00:36:45,715 --> 00:36:49,788
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.

536
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,673
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...

537
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:55,827
- that I'm going to put up with a--
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.

538
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:04,989
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook!
- Hook!

539
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:06,952
Hook! Oh!

540
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:09,708
Quick, Wendy.

541
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:14,515
They've captured Tiger Lily.

542
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:28,992
Looks like they're
headin' for Skull Rock.

543
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:32,351
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.

544
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:50,394
Now, me dear Princess,
this is me proposition.

545
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:54,593
You tell me the hiding place
of Peter Pan...

546
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:56,506
and I shall set you free.

547
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:59,348
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.

548
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:02,268
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?

549
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:05,631
Oh, yes, always, Captain.

550
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:10,072
You'd better talk, me dear,
for soon the tide will be in...

551
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,032
and then it will be too late.

552
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:16,347
- I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
- ""Fun''?

553
00:38:17,315 --> 00:38:18,668
Remember...

554
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,792
there is no path
through water...

555
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,514
to the happy hunting ground.

556
00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:28,748
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!

557
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:33,147
Manatoa, great spirit
of mighty seawater, speak!

558
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:37,514
Beware, Captain Hook!

559
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:40,029
Beware! Beware!

560
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:43,824
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.

561
00:38:43,915 --> 00:38:47,874
Stand by, Smee,
while I take a look around.

562
00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:51,231
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?

563
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:07,471
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.

564
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:13,311
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?

565
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:18,423
Release the princess
and take her back to her people.

566
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:22,593
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess--

567
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:27,351
- But-- But, Captain--
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!

568
00:39:27,435 --> 00:39:29,585
Aye, aye, sir.

569
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:36,272
- Well, at last Captain Hook's
comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!

570
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:39,347
I told him all along you Indians
wouldn't betray Peter Pan.

571
00:39:39,435 --> 00:39:43,792
And just what do you think
you are doing, Mr Smee?

572
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:47,868
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.

573
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:52,426
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain.
Didn't you just say to go--

574
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,871
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!

575
00:39:55,955 --> 00:40:01,427
- My orders. Of all the bumbling--
- Mr Smee!

576
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:04,587
Just exactly what do you
think you are doing?

577
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:07,109
Putting her back
like you said, Captain.

578
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:09,311
I said nothing of the sort!

579
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:12,228
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that--

580
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:14,271
For the last time, Mr Smee.

581
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:18,348
Take the princess
back to her people.

582
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:23,304
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?

583
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:27,183
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.

584
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:30,267
When you return to the ship,
tell the whole crew...

585
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:32,949
to help themselves
to me best rum.

586
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:38,348
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!

587
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:41,385
Why, it's Peter Pan.

588
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:46,430
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.

589
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:50,269
Come down, boy,
if you've a taste for cold steel.

590
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:53,552
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.

591
00:41:06,315 --> 00:41:09,034
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!

592
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:13,825
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!

593
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:16,349
Right here, Mr Smee.

594
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:19,472
Hold it, you fool!
No! No!

595
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:25,474
Captain?

596
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:27,386
Oh, how dreadful.

597
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:32,185
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.

598
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:36,905
Captain!

599
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,667
In the back, Captain?

600
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:47,351
Give it to him, Captain!

601
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:50,108
Cleave him to the brisket.

602
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,984
I've got you this time, Pan.

603
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:12,994
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.

604
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:17,273
I'll get you for this, Pan,
if it's the last thing I do!

605
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:22,027
I say, Captain,
do you hear something?

606
00:42:22,115 --> 00:42:24,265
No.

607
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,194
No!

608
00:42:30,835 --> 00:42:32,746
No!

609
00:42:34,475 --> 00:42:37,547
Mr Crocodile,
do you like codfish?

610
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:39,944
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!

611
00:42:47,795 --> 00:42:49,547
No!

612
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:53,464
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!

613
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:56,865
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.

614
00:42:59,635 --> 00:43:01,705
Smee!

615
00:43:02,555 --> 00:43:04,034
Smee!

616
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:12,591
Smee!

617
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:16,633
Ow!

618
00:43:19,395 --> 00:43:21,226
Captain! Captain!

619
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:24,944
Smee! Smee!

620
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,866
- Give him back!
- Smee--

621
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:33,713
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship--

622
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:37,867
Whoa!

623
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:44,426
Smee!

624
00:43:46,195 --> 00:43:48,993
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?

625
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:51,509
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.

626
00:43:53,395 --> 00:43:55,545
Help--

627
00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:05,265
Peter. Wait for me.

628
00:44:34,195 --> 00:44:37,665
That cursed Peter Pan.

629
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:41,634
Making a fool out of me.

630
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:50,548
Oh, my head.

631
00:44:55,955 --> 00:44:59,630
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

632
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:01,990
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!

633
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,828
The poor Captain
has a splitting headache.

634
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,987
We mustn't annoy him.

635
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:28,951
Well, Captain, it's nice
to see you smiling again.

636
00:45:29,035 --> 00:45:33,347
Brings back the good old days when
we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.

637
00:45:33,435 --> 00:45:36,666
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain...

638
00:45:36,755 --> 00:45:39,064
why don't we put to sea again?

639
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:42,272
You know, there's trouble
brewin' on the island.

640
00:45:42,355 --> 00:45:44,186
Women trouble.

641
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:47,426
I wouldn't want this
to go any farther, but...

642
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:51,224
the cook told me that
the first mate told him...

643
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:55,467
that he heard that Pan
has banished Tinker Bell.

644
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:58,433
Whoa!

645
00:45:58,515 --> 00:46:03,635
Why, you doddering imbecile, I--
Did you say Pan...

646
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:06,309
has banished Tinker Bell?

647
00:46:06,395 --> 00:46:08,033
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.

648
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:10,788
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.

649
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,754
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.

650
00:46:14,835 --> 00:46:19,033
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.

651
00:46:19,115 --> 00:46:22,107
This ain't no place
for a respectable pirate.

652
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:24,663
That's it, Smee!
That's it!

653
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:26,632
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.

654
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:29,627
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.

655
00:46:29,715 --> 00:46:32,183
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner
we get going, the better.

656
00:46:32,275 --> 00:46:36,393
Ah, yes, a jealous female
can be tricked into anything.

657
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:38,943
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.

658
00:46:39,035 --> 00:46:41,708
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.

659
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:45,265
If we impress the pixie, convince her
we're eager to help her...

660
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:48,267
the wench may chart
our course to a...

661
00:46:48,355 --> 00:46:51,074
certain hiding place.

662
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:53,623
Our best hiding place
is the Spanish main, sir.

663
00:46:53,715 --> 00:46:55,865
I'll set our course--

664
00:46:55,955 --> 00:47:00,426
And where do you think
you are going?

665
00:47:00,515 --> 00:47:03,552
T-To tell the boys
we sails with the tide, sir.

666
00:47:03,635 --> 00:47:08,345
You will go ashore,
pick up Tinker Bell...

667
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:11,632
and bring her to me.

668
00:47:12,715 --> 00:47:14,945
Understand?

669
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:17,310
Aye, aye, s-s-s-sir.

670
00:47:27,355 --> 00:47:30,108
- How!
- How!

671
00:47:32,155 --> 00:47:33,986
What's the Chief doing,John?

672
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:38,114
He's delivering an oration
in sign language.

673
00:47:38,195 --> 00:47:41,631
- What's he saying?
- He says...

674
00:47:41,715 --> 00:47:45,151
""Peter Pan, mighty warrior.

675
00:47:45,235 --> 00:47:47,226
""Save Tiger Lily.

676
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:50,910
Make big Chief heap glad.''

677
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:54,112
Well, he certainly
doesn't look ""heap glad.''

678
00:47:54,195 --> 00:47:58,108
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.

679
00:47:58,195 --> 00:48:00,834
You now Little Flying Eagle.

680
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:05,474
- Hurray for Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!
- Hurray!

681
00:48:05,555 --> 00:48:07,830
Hurray!

682
00:48:07,915 --> 00:48:11,703
- Oh, how wonderful!
- Hurray!

683
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:25,309
Teach 'em paleface brother
all about red man.

684
00:48:25,395 --> 00:48:28,193
Good, this should be
most enlightening.

685
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:30,743
Uh, what makes the red man red?

686
00:48:30,835 --> 00:48:32,985
- When did he first say, ""Ugh''?
- First say, ""Ugh''?

687
00:48:33,075 --> 00:48:35,225
Why does he ask you, ""How''?

688
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:38,432
""Why does he ask you, 'How'?''

689
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:41,985
Hana mana ganda
Why does he ask you, how

690
00:48:42,075 --> 00:48:47,229
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Once the Injun didn't know all
the things that he know now

691
00:48:47,315 --> 00:48:49,226
But the Injun
He sure learn a lot

692
00:48:49,315 --> 00:48:52,432
And it's all from asking how

693
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:56,064
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
We translate for you

694
00:48:56,155 --> 00:48:59,227
Hana means what mana means
and ganda means that too

695
00:48:59,315 --> 00:49:02,751
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

696
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:06,669
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

697
00:49:06,755 --> 00:49:09,827
- Hana mana ganda
- Squaw, no dance.

698
00:49:09,915 --> 00:49:12,349
Squaw, get 'em firewood.

699
00:49:12,435 --> 00:49:16,189
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

700
00:49:24,355 --> 00:49:28,189
In the Injun book, it say
when first brave married squaw

701
00:49:28,275 --> 00:49:33,144
He gave out with heap big ""ugh'"
when he saw his mother-in-law

702
00:49:33,235 --> 00:49:36,671
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

703
00:49:36,755 --> 00:49:38,825
Hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda

704
00:49:38,915 --> 00:49:43,033
What made the red man red

705
00:49:43,115 --> 00:49:46,903
What made the red man red

706
00:49:46,995 --> 00:49:50,624
Let's go back a million years
to the very first Injun prince

707
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:53,946
He kissed a maid and start to blush
and we've all been blushin'since

708
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:56,833
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda

709
00:49:56,915 --> 00:49:58,507
Now you've got it right
from the head man

710
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,233
The real true story
of the red man

711
00:50:00,315 --> 00:50:04,593
No matter what's been
written or said, no matter what

712
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:12,355
Now you know why
the red man's red

713
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:25,153
- Wa-hoo!
-John!

714
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:28,352
Squaw take 'em papoose.
Wa-hoo!

715
00:50:28,435 --> 00:50:32,508
- Michael!
- Squaw, get 'em firewood.

716
00:50:32,595 --> 00:50:35,553
Squaw no get 'em firewood!

717
00:50:35,635 --> 00:50:38,103
Squaw go home.

718
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:49,345
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell...

719
00:50:49,435 --> 00:50:52,233
but Captain Hook
would like a word with ya.

720
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:08,991
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.

721
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:15,266
Tomorrow I leave the island,
never to return.

722
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:18,586
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and--

723
00:51:23,595 --> 00:51:25,984
And that's why I asked
you over, me dear...

724
00:51:26,075 --> 00:51:29,431
to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.

725
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:35,467
Oh, Pan has his faults,
to be sure.

726
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:38,353
Uh, bringing that Wendy
to the island, for instance.

727
00:51:38,435 --> 00:51:40,266
Dangerous business, that.

728
00:51:43,675 --> 00:51:49,033
Why, rumour has it that already
she has come between you and Peter.

729
00:51:52,915 --> 00:51:56,954
But what's this?
Tears?

730
00:51:57,035 --> 00:52:01,153
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.

731
00:52:01,235 --> 00:52:04,193
The way of a man with a maid.

732
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:08,826
Taking the best years
of her life and then...

733
00:52:08,915 --> 00:52:13,147
casting her aside
like an old glove!

734
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:16,033
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?

735
00:52:16,115 --> 00:52:20,188
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.

736
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:23,824
It's that Wendy who's to blame.

737
00:52:23,915 --> 00:52:27,703
Mr Smee, we must
save the lad from himself.

738
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:30,184
But how?

739
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:33,711
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.

740
00:52:33,795 --> 00:52:36,707
Sail! That's it, Smee!

741
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:43,034
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- ""Shanghai Wendy,'' Captain?

742
00:52:43,115 --> 00:52:48,348
Take her to sea with us.
With her gone, Peter will soon
forget this mad infatuation.

743
00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:51,950
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home--

744
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:57,314
But, Captain, we--
we don't know where Peter Pan lives!

745
00:52:57,395 --> 00:53:00,865
Great Scott,
you're right, Smee!

746
00:53:00,955 --> 00:53:02,274
What's that, my dear?

747
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:08,668
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.

748
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:12,509
- Take this down, Smee.
- ""Take this down, Smee.''

749
00:53:12,595 --> 00:53:14,586
Aye, aye, Captain.

750
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:23,552
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- ""Start at Pegleg Point.''

751
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:28,386
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- ""Blindman's Bluff.''

752
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:33,503
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and
a jump across Crocodile Creek.

753
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:37,986
Then north by northeast,
one, two, three.

754
00:53:38,075 --> 00:53:41,909
Well, get on with it--
Continue, my dear.

755
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:47,434
I mustn't harm Peter?

756
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:51,394
Madam, Captain Hook
gives his word...

757
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:54,148
not to lay a finger...

758
00:53:54,235 --> 00:53:56,874
or a hook on Peter Pan.

759
00:54:00,555 --> 00:54:03,433
Ah, Hangman's Tree.

760
00:54:03,515 --> 00:54:07,793
So that's the entrance
to his hiding place.

761
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:11,550
Thank you, me dear.

Big Chief Flying Eagle
greets his braves.

770
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,152
- How!
- Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!

771
00:54:48,235 --> 00:54:49,714
- How.
- How.

772
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:52,628
Big Chief greets Little Mother.

773
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:55,070
- How!
- Ugh!

774
00:54:55,155 --> 00:54:58,272
Aw, Wendy, is that
all you have to say?

775
00:54:58,355 --> 00:55:01,745
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.

776
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:04,713
- Tiger Lily?
-John! Michael!

777
00:55:04,795 --> 00:55:07,025
Take off that war paint
and get ready for bed.

778
00:55:07,115 --> 00:55:09,754
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.

779
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:11,985
Go for days without sleep.

780
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,111
- But, boys, we're going
home in the morning.
- Home!

781
00:55:14,195 --> 00:55:17,824
- And--
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.

782
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:22,306
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.

783
00:55:22,395 --> 00:55:25,034
Now, Peter, let's stop
pretending and be practical.

784
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:28,391
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.

785
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:31,592
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.

786
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:35,270
Do you want to stay here
and grow up like-- like savages?

787
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:37,186
- Of course.
- But you can't.

788
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:40,585
You need a mother.
We all do.

789
00:55:40,675 --> 00:55:42,745
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?

790
00:55:42,835 --> 00:55:44,826
Why, Michael, of course not!

791
00:55:44,915 --> 00:55:46,985
Surely you haven't forgotten
our real mother!

792
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:52,433
Did she have silky ears
and wear a fur coat?

793
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,110
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.

794
00:55:56,195 --> 00:55:58,026
I think I had a mother once.

795
00:55:58,115 --> 00:56:01,869
- What was she like?
- What was she like?
- I forget.

796
00:56:01,955 --> 00:56:04,788
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!

797
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:07,309
Hey, who ya shovin'?

798
00:56:08,795 --> 00:56:12,993
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.

799
00:56:13,075 --> 00:56:15,509
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.

800
00:56:15,755 --> 00:56:18,747
Well, a mother,
a real mother...

801
00:56:18,835 --> 00:56:22,271
is the most wonderful person
in the world.

802
00:56:22,355 --> 00:56:25,791
She's the angel voice...

803
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,150
that bids you good night...

804
00:56:28,235 --> 00:56:31,033
kisses your cheek...

805
00:56:31,115 --> 00:56:33,310
whispers, ""Sleep tight.''

806
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:37,467
Your mother

807
00:56:37,555 --> 00:56:41,264
And mine

808
00:56:41,355 --> 00:56:46,065
Your mother

809
00:56:46,155 --> 00:56:50,034
And mine

810
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:55,951
The helping hand
that guides you along

811
00:56:56,035 --> 00:57:02,827
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong

812
00:57:02,915 --> 00:57:06,510
Your mother

813
00:57:06,595 --> 00:57:10,508
And mine

814
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:15,464
Your mother

815
00:57:15,555 --> 00:57:19,946
And mine

816
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:25,234
What makes mothers
all that they are

817
00:57:25,315 --> 00:57:34,269
Might as well ask
what makes a star

818
00:57:34,355 --> 00:57:40,112
Ask your heart
to tell you her worth

819
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:43,312
Your heart will say

820
00:57:43,395 --> 00:57:47,786
Heaven on earth

821
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:52,107
- Another word
- Shh.

822
00:57:52,195 --> 00:57:56,791
For divine

823
00:57:56,875 --> 00:58:02,507
Your mother

824
00:58:02,595 --> 00:58:05,473
And mine

825
00:58:09,475 --> 00:58:14,185
- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.

826
00:58:14,275 --> 00:58:16,584
I propose we leave
for home at once.

827
00:58:16,675 --> 00:58:19,508
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!
- Come on! Let me go!

828
00:58:19,595 --> 00:58:23,634
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.

829
00:58:23,715 --> 00:58:26,548
Uh, that is,
if Peter doesn't mind.

830
00:58:26,635 --> 00:58:29,388
Go on!
Go back and grow up!

831
00:58:29,475 --> 00:58:32,547
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up...

832
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:34,705
you can never come back!

833
00:58:34,795 --> 00:58:37,992
- Never!
- Dear.

834
00:58:38,075 --> 00:58:41,670
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!

835
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:43,746
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.

836
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:47,106
They'll be back.

837
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,826
Peter.

838
00:58:56,955 --> 00:58:59,423
Goodbye, Peter.

839
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,706
All right, men.
Take them away.

840
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:16,073
And now, Smee, to take care
of Master Peter Pan.

841
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:21,707
But, Captain, wouldn't it
be more humane-like to slit his throat?

842
00:59:21,795 --> 00:59:24,389
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.

843
00:59:24,475 --> 00:59:28,070
But I have given me word
not to lay a finger...

844
00:59:28,155 --> 00:59:31,431
or a hook on Peter Pan.

845
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:37,265
And Captain Hook
never breaks a promise.

846
00:59:37,515 --> 00:59:41,110
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho

847
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:43,186
So try the life of a thief

848
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:45,106
Just sample the life of a crook

849
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:47,106
There isn't a boy
who won't enjoy

850
00:59:47,195 --> 00:59:49,914
A-workin'for Captain Hook

851
00:59:49,995 --> 00:59:52,953
The world's most famous crook

852
00:59:53,035 --> 00:59:57,426
Crook, crook, crickety
crockety, crickety, crick
the croc is after Captain--

853
00:59:58,715 --> 01:00:00,626
A special offer for today

854
01:00:00,715 --> 01:00:02,751
I'll tell you what I'll do

855
01:00:02,835 --> 01:00:05,588
All those who sign without delay

856
01:00:05,675 --> 01:00:08,189
Will get a free tattoo

857
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:10,743
Why, it's like money in the bank

858
01:00:10,835 --> 01:00:13,588
Come on
Join up and I'll be frank

859
01:00:13,675 --> 01:00:17,634
Unless you do
you'll walk the plank

860
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:19,546
The choice is up to you

861
01:00:19,635 --> 01:00:21,751
The choice is up to you

862
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:25,464
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho

863
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,386
You'll love the life of a thief

864
01:00:27,475 --> 01:00:29,511
You'll relish the life
of a crook

865
01:00:29,595 --> 01:00:31,347
There's barrels
of fun for everyone

866
01:00:31,435 --> 01:00:34,905
And you'll get treasures
by the ton

867
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:38,954
So come and sign the book

868
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,868
Join up with Captain Hook

869
01:00:41,955 --> 01:00:44,071
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!

870
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:47,306
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!

871
01:00:47,395 --> 01:00:52,150
Boys! Aren't you
ashamed of yourselves?

872
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:55,272
But Captain Hook is
most insistent, Wendy.

873
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:58,552
Yeah! He says we'll walk
the plank if we don't.

874
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:01,991
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.

875
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:05,670
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.

876
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:09,025
Peter Pan will save them.

877
01:01:10,995 --> 01:01:12,826
Oh, Captain, you did it.

878
01:01:12,915 --> 01:01:15,554
But a thousand pardons, my dear.

879
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:18,786
I don't believe you are
in on our little joke.

880
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:22,948
You see, we left
a present for Peter.

881
01:01:23,035 --> 01:01:25,754
Sort of a surprise package,
you might say.

882
01:01:25,835 --> 01:01:29,145
Why, I can see our little
friend at this very moment...

883
01:01:29,235 --> 01:01:33,308
reading the tender inscription.

884
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:37,832
""To Peter, with love
from Wendy.

885
01:01:37,915 --> 01:01:41,351
Do not open till 6 o'clock.''

886
01:01:42,515 --> 01:01:44,346
Huh. I wonder what's in it.

887
01:01:44,435 --> 01:01:47,427
Could he but see
within the package...

888
01:01:47,515 --> 01:01:51,713
he would find an ingenious
little device.

889
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:54,593
Set, so that when
the clock is like this...

890
01:01:54,675 --> 01:01:57,792
Peter Pan will be blasted...

891
01:01:57,875 --> 01:02:01,504
out of Never Land forever.

892
01:02:01,595 --> 01:02:02,311
No!

893
01:02:06,835 --> 01:02:09,110
But time grows short.

894
01:02:09,195 --> 01:02:13,552
We have but 1 8 seconds.

895
01:02:13,635 --> 01:02:16,786
Fifteen seconds.

896
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:19,548
Thirteen seconds.

897
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,466
Twelve seconds.

898
01:02:21,555 --> 01:02:23,432
Well, I guess
I can open it now.

899
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:32,114
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.

900
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:35,471
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?

901
01:02:35,555 --> 01:02:37,625
Hook? A bomb?

902
01:02:37,715 --> 01:02:39,785
Don't be ridiculous!

903
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:51,786
And so passeth a worthy opponent.

904
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,706
Amen.

905
01:02:57,475 --> 01:03:00,273
Hook! It was a bomb!

906
01:03:00,355 --> 01:03:04,587
Why, if it hadn't been
for Tink-- Tinker Bell!

907
01:03:08,835 --> 01:03:11,633
Tink? Tinker Bell?

908
01:03:14,435 --> 01:03:16,346
Where are you, Tink?

909
01:03:16,435 --> 01:03:19,632
Tink? Tinker Bell!

910
01:03:26,395 --> 01:03:29,546
Tink. Are you all right?

911
01:03:29,635 --> 01:03:33,344
Wendy? The boys?

912
01:03:35,995 --> 01:03:37,951
But I've gotta save you first.

913
01:03:38,035 --> 01:03:40,071
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!

914
01:03:40,155 --> 01:03:43,272
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?

915
01:03:43,355 --> 01:03:46,791
You mean more to me than
anything in this whole world!

916
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:54,190
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?

917
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:57,745
Captain Hook, we will
never join your crew.

918
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:01,032
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.

919
01:04:01,115 --> 01:04:04,391
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

920
01:04:04,475 --> 01:04:08,263
- Be brave,John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.

921
01:04:08,355 --> 01:04:11,745
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Come on!

922
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:14,395
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going!
Don't give us no trouble!

923
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:17,194
Go on! Go on!
Get it over with!

924
01:04:17,275 --> 01:04:20,073
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!

925
01:04:27,275 --> 01:04:29,914
Wendy! Wendy!

926
01:04:34,155 --> 01:04:38,148
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.

927
01:04:38,235 --> 01:04:41,352
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.

928
01:04:41,435 --> 01:04:44,074
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.

929
01:04:44,155 --> 01:04:47,830
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates,
it's a black day.

930
01:04:47,915 --> 01:04:50,304
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.

931
01:04:50,395 --> 01:04:52,590
The ship is bewitched.

932
01:04:52,675 --> 01:04:54,666
No splash, Captain.

933
01:04:54,755 --> 01:04:59,670
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.

934
01:04:59,755 --> 01:05:01,950
I'll give you a splash!

935
01:05:02,035 --> 01:05:04,469
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!

936
01:05:04,675 --> 01:05:08,304
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!

937
01:05:08,395 --> 01:05:10,306
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!

938
01:05:10,395 --> 01:05:12,511
It's his blinkin' ghost
what's talkin'!

939
01:05:12,595 --> 01:05:14,347
Say your prayers, Hook.

940
01:05:14,435 --> 01:05:18,667
I'll show you this ghost
has blood in his veins.

941
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:21,588
I'll run him through! Ooh!

942
01:05:21,675 --> 01:05:23,586
Take that!

943
01:05:30,235 --> 01:05:31,793
Curse this hook!

944
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:35,426
Come on, everybody!

945
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:41,513
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!

946
01:05:41,595 --> 01:05:44,428
Don't stand there,
you bilge rats!

947
01:05:44,515 --> 01:05:47,473
Get those scurvy brats!

948
01:05:47,555 --> 01:05:50,308
After the brats, men!

949
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:16,511
This is no mere boy.

950
01:06:16,595 --> 01:06:20,065
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!

951
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:29,626
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!

952
01:06:29,715 --> 01:06:32,752
Steady, men. Steady.

953
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:34,746
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!

954
01:06:34,835 --> 01:06:38,271
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!

955
01:06:38,355 --> 01:06:40,869
Down, you blackguard!

956
01:07:15,595 --> 01:07:17,233
Hurray!

957
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:26,585
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!
- Yea for Bear Killer!

958
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,712
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!

959
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,433
Coward? Me?

960
01:07:31,595 --> 01:07:36,510
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight
old Hook man-to-man!

961
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:39,029
You'd fly away like
a cowardly sparrow!

962
01:07:39,115 --> 01:07:42,073
Nobody calls Pan
a coward and lives!

963
01:07:42,155 --> 01:07:44,988
I'll fight you man-to-man,
with one hand behind my back.

964
01:07:46,475 --> 01:07:51,071
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!

965
01:07:51,155 --> 01:07:55,228
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!

966
01:08:15,035 --> 01:08:20,109
Now! Insolent youth,
prepare to die!

967
01:08:20,195 --> 01:08:22,789
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!

968
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:26,788
No! I gave my word.

969
01:08:29,555 --> 01:08:32,274
You're mine, Hook!

970
01:08:33,795 --> 01:08:36,992
Cleave him to the brisket!

971
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:41,512
You wouldn't do old Hook
in now, would you, lad?

972
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:45,907
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.

973
01:08:45,995 --> 01:08:51,433
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.

974
01:08:51,515 --> 01:08:54,746
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!

975
01:08:54,835 --> 01:08:59,067
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!

976
01:08:59,155 --> 01:09:03,307
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish

977
01:09:03,395 --> 01:09:07,468
-Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish
-All right, Hook...

978
01:09:07,555 --> 01:09:11,594
you're free to go,
and never return.

979
01:09:14,955 --> 01:09:16,866
Peter!

980
01:09:24,835 --> 01:09:27,269
Smee! Smee!

981
01:09:40,475 --> 01:09:42,306
Smee!

982
01:09:43,995 --> 01:09:48,864
Smee! Smee!

983
01:09:48,955 --> 01:09:52,868
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!

984
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,423
Captain!

985
01:09:55,515 --> 01:09:57,506
Captain! Captain!

986
01:09:58,955 --> 01:10:00,388
Hurray!

987
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:04,791
Hurray for Captain Pan!

988
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:07,992
All right, ya swabs,
aloft with ya!

989
01:10:08,075 --> 01:10:11,954
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!

990
01:10:12,035 --> 01:10:15,823
But, but, Peter--
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.

991
01:10:15,915 --> 01:10:20,784
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir,
where we're sailing?

992
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:24,629
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.

993
01:10:24,715 --> 01:10:28,469
Michael!John!
We're going home!

994
01:10:28,555 --> 01:10:31,194
Man the capstan!

995
01:10:31,275 --> 01:10:33,914
Hoist anchor!

996
01:10:36,555 --> 01:10:38,511
Pixie dust!

997
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:19,945
George, I am so glad you
changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.

998
01:11:20,035 --> 01:11:24,074
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.

999
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,032
Do I, Nana?

1000
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:31,631
Oh! Wendy!

1001
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:37,032
Wendy, what on earth
are you doing there?

1002
01:11:37,115 --> 01:11:39,470
Mmm. Hmm?

1003
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:44,269
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?

1004
01:11:44,355 --> 01:11:47,108
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.

1005
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:49,550
- Lost Bo-- Ready?
- To grow up.

1006
01:11:49,635 --> 01:11:51,865
That's why they went
back to Never Land.

1007
01:11:51,955 --> 01:11:54,913
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.

1008
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:58,465
- Uh, ""am''?
- Uh, ready to grow up.

1009
01:11:58,555 --> 01:12:00,705
Oh! Oh! Uh--

1010
01:12:00,795 --> 01:12:04,231
Well, my dear,
all in good time.

1011
01:12:04,315 --> 01:12:06,954
- After all, perhaps we were too--
- Oh, but, Mother...

1012
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:09,503
it was such a wonderful adventure.

1013
01:12:09,595 --> 01:12:12,234
Tinker Bell and the mermaids
and Peter Pan.

1014
01:12:12,315 --> 01:12:14,146
Oh, he was the most
wonderful of all.

1015
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:17,193
- Why, why, even when
we were kidnapped, I--
- Kidnapped!

1016
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:20,790
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan
would save us, and he did.

1017
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:23,594
And we all called him a codfish!

1018
01:12:23,675 --> 01:12:25,666
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.

1019
01:12:25,755 --> 01:12:29,430
And then we sailed away
on a ship in the sky.

1020
01:12:29,515 --> 01:12:33,827
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.

1021
01:12:33,915 --> 01:12:38,625
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?

1022
01:12:38,715 --> 01:12:41,752
See how well he sails the ship.

1023
01:12:41,835 --> 01:12:46,306
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?

1024
01:12:49,035 --> 01:12:51,151
Nana, d-did you see--

1025
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,744
You know, I have
the strangest feeling...

1026
01:12:55,835 --> 01:12:58,144
that I've seen that ship before.

1027
01:12:58,235 --> 01:13:00,465
A long time ago...

1028
01:13:00,555 --> 01:13:02,989
when I was very young.

1029
01:13:03,075 --> 01:13:07,193
- George, dear.
- Father.

1030
01:13:07,275 --> 01:13:10,392
When there's a smile in your heart

1031
01:13:10,475 --> 01:13:15,503
There's no better time to start

1032
01:13:15,595 --> 01:13:17,586
Think of all thejoy you'll find

1033
01:13:17,675 --> 01:13:19,506
When you leave the world behind

1034
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,951
And bid your cares goodbye

1035
01:13:23,035 --> 01:13:25,595
You can fly

1036
01:13:25,675 --> 01:13:27,984
You can fly

1037
01:13:29,195 --> 01:13:33,746
You can fly
