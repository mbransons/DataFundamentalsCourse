1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:38,882
No. Cowboys and Indians. Bang-bang.

3
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:41,283
Up the stairway all of you.
Go on. Hurry up. Quickly.

4
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:44,036
Bang, bang, bang!

5
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,100
Good job, Winifred. You got them
here right side up and kicking.

6
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,644
Kicking is right.
They are certainly a handful.

7
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:56,909
I'm glad those kids are
here where it's safe.

8
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,364
Make that "where it's safe as yet".

9
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:02,674
Scare me some more. Tell me how it
is going to be when they bomb Omaha.

10
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,428
It's not going to be nice, Junior.

11
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:05,990
Not going to be nice at all.

12
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:09,054
Six months.

13
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,447
That's a long time to be away.

14
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,096
Three years is longer.

15
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:15,159
I'll sure be glad to see her.

16
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,962
Who, the Statue of Liberty?
You've just passed her.

17
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:20,238
Nope. I mean my other best girl.

18
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:24,418
You say, your "other"?
- Sure. Her name is Paula.

19
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,868
A great gal. I saw a
lot of her before I left.

20
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:29,301
Paula, huh?

21
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,599
You never told me about her.

22
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,962
Do I have to tell you everything?
- Not a bad idea.

23
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,864
Anybody I know?
- And nobody you owe either.

24
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,216
I want to marry her, Jonny.

25
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:40,550
No fooling?

26
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:42,089
That's it exactly. No fooling.

27
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:44,883
You think it is big,
important stuff, huh?

28
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,966
And the babe? Likewise?

29
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:49,044
From her letters, I'd say yes.

30
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:51,432
It wasn't all set up before you left?

31
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:54,983
Not quite. But this six months of
being apart has done it. Made it solid.

32
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:56,364
Six months?

33
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,999
If it took you that long to make
up your mind, it's no good.

34
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:01,304
Nothing will come of it.
- How do you know?

35
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:05,763
Nothing ever lasted six months with you.
Not even the seven-year itch.

36
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:08,909
Maybe so, Junior. But when I
meet the ultimate babe, I'll know it.

37
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:10,705
Like that! So will you.

38
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,768
Well, I might be just
slow and sure, Jonny.

39
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:15,880
Awful sure.
- Listen, Junior.

40
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,346
Guys like us are strictly
cash and carry on.

41
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,194
Make hay and then make tracks.

42
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,897
A war correspondent has got
no business getting married.

43
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:26,174
You're selling me, Jonny.
- And you're getting a bargain.

44
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,419
It might have cost you a trip to
Reno to find out the same thing.

45
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,344
Jonny, Kirk.
- Hi, honey.

46
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:47,850
My goodness, Jonny.

47
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:49,867
How is your goodness these days?

48
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,678
You can tell our revered
editor we'll see him now.

49
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:55,352
Jonny, Mr Stafford is pretty mad at you.

50
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,863
He's mad? Huh!

51
00:03:57,072 --> 00:04:00,140
In view of progress made in Washington
by the Japanese diplomatic mission.

52
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:04,363
The prospect of war between this nation
and Japan becomes more remote that ever.

53
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:07,651
As a matter of fact, informed
sources have indicated.

54
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:10,063
That an unofficial agreement
to guarantee peace ..

55
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:11,700
Has already been reached.

56
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:15,470
Print that on page 1 column 8
for the banner line.

57
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:18,062
Now, Davis.

58
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,208
I must hear your version of why you and
your brother were kicked out of Germany.

59
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:23,304
That's easy.
For tracking down the truth.

60
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:24,500
And writing it.

61
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,596
You're like all the crackpots who think
this country is headed for trouble.

62
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:30,103
You're an old maid looking
under the bed for burglars.

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,884
That's no place to look
for burglars nowadays.

64
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,942
You'd find him right in bed with you.

65
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,613
You disregarded my instructions.

66
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:40,120
You kept on filing stories that offended
nations with which we are at peace.

67
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:43,116
And you cut the heart and liver
out of our best despatches.

68
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:45,508
We can't publish warmongering rumors.

69
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:47,405
Alarmist tripe.
- "<i>Yes?</i>"

70
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,358
Send Charlie in.
I'm ready for my massage.

71
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:51,185
You say tripe. I say truth.

72
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,730
The only time a paper justifies its
existence is when it prints the truth.

73
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,417
Not when it gets the most advertising.

74
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,030
We've got a story that's
too hot for the cables.

75
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,546
And we'll get it printed, Chief.

76
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,579
The Chronicle isn't
the only paper in town.

77
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:04,371
You can mail my pension to me.

78
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,858
Hold on.

79
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,449
Let me see this masterpiece.
- You won't like it.

80
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,176
I paid for it. Let me see it.

81
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,682
Well if ain't the Davis boys.
- Hiya, Charlie old boy.

82
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,770
Greetings of the season, Charlie.
Long-time no rub.

83
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,211
Hey, how did you find Berlin?

84
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,756
Strictly by our sense of smell.

85
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,339
Moral dynamite.

86
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:36,672
Davis, I've got an ironclad
contract with you.

87
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,449
You try to get this printed and
I'll run you out of the business.

88
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:41,001
This story is dead.

89
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:46,182
Here's the feature you'll read on the
front page of the Chronicle today.

90
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,052
Safe, sane and solid.

91
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:56,175
The news you feed the average man must
be as carefully chosen as his food.

92
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,429
More so.

93
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:04,445
It's a cinch he won't get
fat on what you hand out.

94
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:05,968
I know my business, Davis.

95
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,463
I know just how far
Mr John Q. Citizen will jump.

96
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,164
All ready, Mr Stafford.

97
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:12,391
Just a minute, Chief.

98
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:15,977
Did you ever take a
good look at Charlie?

99
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:16,725
No.

100
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:18,939
What's wrong with him?
- Not a thing.

101
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,551
He's Mr John Q. Citizen.

102
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,016
You talk about him a lot.

103
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:23,953
Take a good look at him.
- What for?

104
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:27,470
Let's try that story out on him
and see how far he jumps.

105
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,794
And if there is anything
wrong with where he lands.

106
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,084
Alright, Davis.

107
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,763
I don't mind giving you
a little object lesson.

108
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,790
Charlie. Come here.

109
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:39,842
Let's see what this does
to your horse sense.

110
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:45,192
I'll give your side a real break.
You read it to him.

111
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:48,141
Charlie.

112
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:50,994
We're about to make
a one-man poll of you.

113
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,545
You're a human guinea-pig.

114
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,799
I'm taking bets right now
you will prove my point.

115
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:57,307
So listen carefully
and be ready to jump.

116
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,705
Just a minute, Chief.

117
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:06,048
Gather round, Charlie. Right over here.

118
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,311
You too, Junior.

119
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:13,453
We want hear every word of this.

120
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:15,643
Okay, Chief.

121
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:21,530
"<i>By Jonny and Kirk Davis. Recently
returned correspondents in Berlin</i>."

122
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:25,621
"<i>These facts gathered from the Japanese
embassy under curious circumstances</i>."

123
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,995
Curious circumstances.

124
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,186
I happen to know those
curious circumstances.

125
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:33,994
Somebody gave the Japanese counsel
a Mickey Fin in a glass of Sake.

126
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:42,555
"<i>The Pacific Ocean is not
nearly as wide as it seems</i> .."

127
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,500
"<i>When you try to paddle
across it in a canoe</i>."

128
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:46,513
"<i>At the Japanese general headquarters</i>."

129
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,920
"<i>Which has moved from
Tokyo to the Wilhelmstrasse</i>."

130
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:52,630
You mean them two Aryans
is working together?

131
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,811
"<i>Plans are being laid to stab the United
States of American in the back</i> .."

132
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,756
"<i>While presumably patting
it on the shoulder</i>."

133
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:02,715
"<i>No-one can foretell just
where the blow will fall</i>."

134
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:05,351
"<i>But Japanese troop movements
and naval manoeuvres</i> .."

135
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,689
"<i>While ostensibly aimed at
the subjection of China</i>."

136
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,749
"<i>Are in reality, directed
at the United States</i>."

137
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,729
Now I leave it to you.

138
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,020
Did you really expect me
to print a thing like that?

139
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,315
Wouldn't that look fine?

140
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:18,999
Where, boss?

141
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:21,262
Where? You know where
you'd like to see it.

142
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:24,887
You would like me to print it
page 1 column 8 with a banner line.

143
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,848
Thanks. You gave it every break.

144
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:33,692
Well, Charlie?

145
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,886
What does the story you just heard make
you think the United states ought to do?

146
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,132
I think the United States
ought to wise up.

147
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:40,597
And go in there swinging.

148
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:44,940
You see how you'll make Mister
Average Man react? He'd want to fight.

149
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,501
What's wrong with that?
It's either fight or go under.

150
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,020
There are ways of
avoiding a fight that ..

151
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:52,500
Mr Average Man doesn't have
to worry his little head about.

152
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:54,422
I'm a reporter, not a psychologist.

153
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,528
Maybe there are ways
of avoiding a slugfest.

154
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,612
Could it be that you are
getting some sense?

155
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:01,502
It could be.

156
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:02,639
I doubt it.

157
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,453
Your kind never learn.

158
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:06,296
You don't see straight.

159
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:08,326
You are full of phony
ideas about people.

160
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:10,465
People. Huh.

161
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:13,780
Why can't you see the rank
and file as mostly rank.

162
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:16,532
Say, boss.

163
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,526
Isn't this record about due
in the composing room?

164
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:21,690
It's overdue. Ring Miss Coulter.

165
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,011
Okay boss.

166
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,083
"<i>Yes, Mr Stafford?</i>"
- Come in, honey.

167
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:26,989
Anything you say.

168
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,431
I wish you meant that, Davis.

169
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,961
You'd be the best man in your
field if you'd keep your head.

170
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:32,218
I'm going to try.

171
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:33,487
From now on.

172
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,172
Yes, Mr Stafford?

173
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:37,459
Miss Coulter.

174
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,803
Get this moving. We're
holding up the edition.

175
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,916
This is no time for butterfingers,
Honey. This is for posterity.

176
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,430
I don't worry about being remembered.
I want people to know I'm here now.

177
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,210
Oh, Expense account sheet.
- Yeah?

178
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:53,821
I kept it down to the bone.

179
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:55,756
Ah well.

180
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,558
What's this? You bought
an observation balloon?

181
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:08,531
It was an old one.
It belonged to the Persians.

182
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,751
I think I'll go down and
say hello to the boys.

183
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:16,146
Don't get in their way.
They've got an edition to print.

184
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,305
[ Buzzer ]

185
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,155
Answer it, will you.

186
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:25,564
Office of the Grand Lama.

187
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,470
"<i>What? Who is this?</i>"

188
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:30,018
Jonny Davis. Remember?

189
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:32,863
How are you, Pearcley?

190
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:35,869
"<i>Tell the Chief I just ran his
record. What about that story?</i>"

191
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:39,184
He wants to know
what about your feature.

192
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:42,006
What does he mean:
"what about the feature"?

193
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:42,996
Print it.

194
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,025
The Chief says:

195
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,374
What does he mean, what
about your feature. Print it.

196
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,635
"<i>What's that?</i>"

197
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:50,537
You tell Pearcley if he misses
the afternoon edition, he's fired.

198
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:53,767
And if you miss the afternoon edition.

199
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:55,043
You are fired.

200
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:58,824
"<i>Well, alright. But this sure is a
switcheroo of The Chronicle policy</i>."

201
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,224
"<i>The Chief never</i> .."

202
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:04,576
What's this?

203
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:07,300
What goes on here?

204
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:08,841
What did Pearcley say?

205
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,409
What record is this?

206
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:19,979
Are you crazy?

207
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,597
Listen Charlie, my story
is on that other record.

208
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,620
Yeah?
- Yeah.

209
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,593
It's the truth and it
belongs to guys like you.

210
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:26,672
Are you with me?

211
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:28,853
All the way. Ain't I one
of the rank and file?

212
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:31,156
Come on, before that babe gets in here.

213
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:34,836
Hello? Mr Stafford?

214
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:43,438
Did Mr Stafford buzz me?

215
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:45,477
No. He's getting the works, honey.

216
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:46,478
Oh.

217
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,856
Hey, if we keep this up
he will blow a gasket.

218
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,113
He's too fat for wrestling,
- Five minutes to go.

219
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,063
If we turn him loose
he'll run right and ..

220
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:05,926
Charlie.

221
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,487
I don't think he'll run very far.

222
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,852
Not after the little object
lesson I will give him.

223
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:10,624
Chief.

224
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,179
You are an appeaser.

225
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:13,983
And an appeaser always gets in the neck.

226
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:18,289
He feels he gets what he wants by giving
away things he thinks he doesn't need.

227
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:21,147
First .. he gives away his suit.

228
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:23,578
That's the Rhineland.

229
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:26,703
Then, he gives away his shoes.

230
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,566
One is: Austria.

231
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,171
The other: Czechoslovakia.

232
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:32,851
Then his socks.

233
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:34,270
That's Spain.

234
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:35,801
Then his shirt.

235
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,008
That's Poland.

236
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:41,590
And then his underpants. That's France.

237
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,560
On the button, Charlie.

238
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:48,544
Then there is only one thing
left for Mr Appeaser to do.

239
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,628
Throw in the last thing he's got.

240
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:52,783
The towel.

241
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:03,499
You can let him up now, Charlie.

242
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:06,781
Kirk.

243
00:13:07,577 --> 00:13:08,306
Clothes.

244
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:09,926
Davis.

245
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,906
He can still get somebody on that thing.

246
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,664
Not anymore.

247
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:27,041
This is sabotage.

248
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:31,773
He is going to get Miss Coulter.

249
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,113
I don't think he wants to
call a lady in here now.

250
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:43,512
Do you, Chief?

251
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:50,406
And that Charlie,
is how all appeasers end.

252
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,276
Stripped of everything. Out in the cold.

253
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,844
Extra, extra! Read all about!

254
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:56,875
Do I hear those presses roar?

255
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:00,365
Hello, Chief.

256
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,171
I do.

257
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,664
Here you are, Jonny. Page 1.

258
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,379
Good work, kid.

259
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,595
"<i>Japan plots in Pacific</i>."
Well, what do you know?

260
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:09,501
This is what the Chief
needs to stay warm.

261
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,403
Here you are, sire.
Someday you'll thank me.

262
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:12,624
Come on, Charlie.

263
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,987
My hat.

264
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,677
Beat it down to the cashier
with our expenses.

265
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:17,971
No. My girl's waiting.

266
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,788
She'll wait for an hour. She's spoilt.

267
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:21,631
But I'm late now.
- Go on. Get going.

268
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,958
I'll meet you at Evie Manning's.
Pick up our bags.

269
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,738
Mr Stafford wants you right away.

270
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:28,598
He's not buzzing me.
- Oh, he will be.

271
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:30,104
He'll be buzzing everybody.

272
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,190
Come on, Charlie.

273
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:37,221
They'll never work on another newspaper.

274
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:38,513
I'll bash that Davis.

275
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,904
Do something! Get me a pair of pants!

276
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:48,923
Willy.
- Uhuh?

277
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,255
How do they look?

278
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,401
They'll be fine.

279
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,240
Sure, after they leave your easel.

280
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,652
Don't run down your legs, honey.
They've supported both of us for years.

281
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:57,657
Too long.

282
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:00,804
Some women only worry about double
chins. I stew about my knees falling.

283
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:02,458
Anybody here?
- It's Jonny.

284
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:03,605
Nobody else.

285
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:07,402
I'm back.
- Darling!

286
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:12,792
Why didn't you warn us?

287
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:14,021
Yeah. We'd have moved.

288
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:17,109
What's new in the world?
- My by-line is inside.

289
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:20,254
For further information see today's
Chronicle. The Davis edition.

290
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,340
Where is Kirk?

291
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:22,733
He'll be around.

292
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,335
Home on the range.

293
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:30,758
Well. What's with you?

294
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:32,834
Still selling stockings
with Evie's legs.

295
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:34,711
You know, it's like I told you, Willie.

296
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:36,889
There's no dough in legs.
You should do a comic strip.

297
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:38,605
A comic strip? What do you call these?

298
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:43,349
Hey, where is my ashtray?

299
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:44,809
Here.

300
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,269
You've moved it.

301
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,598
Listen, my lamb.
You've been gone three years.

302
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:50,178
I dusted a couple of times.

303
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:51,968
When, the first month?

304
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:55,965
Why not stop being a bully on the block?
- You got clean sheets on my bed?

305
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:57,345
Yes and no.

306
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:59,739
What you mean, yes and no?
You sound like a diplomat.

307
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,047
That's what I'm trying to be.
I rented the room.

308
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:03,693
What?
- After all, Jonny.

309
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:05,928
He'll find his trunk in the
hall when he gets back.

310
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:07,704
It's a girl and she likes to be alone.

311
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:09,086
In isolation, huh?

312
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,545
You can't go up there.

313
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:12,350
Ow!

314
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,549
Ow!

315
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,150
Will you kindly get this
so-and-so out of my room.

316
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:18,624
Your room?

317
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,141
Hey, I bought that very bathtub
you're putting rings on.

318
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:22,380
Are you going?

319
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,038
Not without a struggle.

320
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:27,103
Then will you please hand me my robe?

321
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:29,291
So I can throw you out, Mr Davis.

322
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,797
May I have your name in full?

323
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:32,927
What for?

324
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,210
Just call me "babe". You will anyway.

325
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:37,378
This is a war of nerves.

326
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,112
Shall I calm for them?

327
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:40,673
The nerve is yours, my friend.

328
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,436
Oh, can't ewe be more than just friends?

329
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:48,024
But we are.

330
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,166
But you still don't trust me.

331
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:54,091
Now I do.

332
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,875
Don't hurry. Most accidents
occur in the bathroom.

333
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,655
Hey, you seem to think you know
a lot about me, don't you.

334
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:08,199
Enough. If I put it in
writing you could sue me.

335
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:09,452
Yeah?

336
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:13,333
Are you good to look at?
- Wouldn't it be more fun to guess?

337
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:14,501
Okay.

338
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,952
I'll reconstruct the missing body
from the evidence at hand.

339
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,389
Now to begin with, the ..

340
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,428
The body is quite a body.

341
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,762
You're getting warm.

342
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,743
You can raise that a couple of degrees.

343
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,935
And you are under twenty-five
and terrific in the face.

344
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:32,876
You'd have to be to wear this hat.

345
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:36,572
Now let's see. Color of hair.

346
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:40,177
Yes, sir.

347
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:42,132
Why, you are a beautiful blond.

348
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:43,973
Hey, get away from that keyhole!

349
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,161
Yes, sir. A beautiful blond.

350
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:47,883
Blue eyes.

351
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:49,301
White skin.

352
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:50,818
A good set of biting teeth.

353
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:53,631
If you're not at the keyhole, how come
you know exactly what I look like?

354
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,092
Wishful thinking, honey.

355
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,226
Hey, you like yourself
a little bit, don't you.

356
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,779
Well, there is a mirror
in here. Remember?

357
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:03,123
Listen, Narcissus.

358
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,126
These same clues could add up to
a frowzy, bleached, lantern-jawed ..

359
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,873
Gimlet-eyed, leathery skinned,
knock-kneed old crone ..

360
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,487
With a mistaken daring in hats.

361
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:12,614
And a ..

362
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,295
They do not, my friend.

363
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,999
Do they?

364
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:25,884
They do not.

365
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,713
Of course we know each other.

366
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:32,177
You bet.

367
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,547
I'm sure glad to set eyes on you again.

368
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:36,612
You know darned well
you don't remember me.

369
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:37,428
What?

370
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:39,949
How could I ever forget you?

371
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:42,820
You won't.

372
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:44,613
Again.

373
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:53,907
How is Kirk?

374
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,156
Oh, you know Kirk too, huh?

375
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:59,325
Sure, I was the cub reporter when you
brought Kirk to the Chronicle office.

376
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:01,090
Just before you left for Europe.

377
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:05,056
Ah, yeah now I remember.
You were that blond girl.

378
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:07,421
My hair was red at the time.

379
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,040
Is Kirk still running errands for you?

380
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:12,160
Why?

381
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,611
Because one of the errands was to send
Kirk with a note asking me for a date.

382
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,776
Oh, sure. Sure.

383
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:20,357
Say, what a night that was.

384
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,145
And what a conga you throw.

385
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:24,098
It was the rumba that year.

386
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,832
Anyway, we didn't dance.

387
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,062
No?
- No.

388
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:29,262
Well, how could I with a sprained ankle?

389
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:31,891
But that was a swell
5-dollar dinner I blew you to.

390
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:33,389
Not even a ham sandwich.

391
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:34,767
No?
- No.

392
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:38,120
Ah, now I remember.
I was on a liquid diet.

393
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:46,706
Not your type.

394
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,811
You ever tried Sweet Surrender?

395
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:51,918
Not lately.

396
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:55,668
We didn't dance, we didn't
drink, we didn't eat.

397
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:57,444
We must have done something.

398
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,388
Or were we just mental?

399
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:01,031
It was all mental.

400
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:03,482
Because you never kept the date.

401
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,219
That's an oversight that
should be corrected.

402
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:09,650
Some other year.

403
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:11,074
Out, mister.

404
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,582
You ought to have that patented.

405
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,454
I will.

406
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,380
After I work out a few improvements.

407
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:40,057
I could suggest a couple.

408
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:42,527
I'll learn faster if you show me.

409
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:46,480
Hey you two. There is somebody
down here to see you.

410
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,895
I think we're being paged.

411
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:50,613
I don't hear a thing.

412
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:52,865
I do.

413
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,470
Well, thanks for the fraternity pin.

414
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:06,706
Kirk, darling.

415
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:08,582
You look wonderful.

416
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:11,409
And you look good enough to eat,
which isn't such a bad idea.

417
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,590
Evie, why didn't you
tell me it was Kirk?

418
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,361
Well, seeing is believing, honey.

419
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,568
Come on, Eve. We've got
to finish this stocking Ad.

420
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,348
Here I am. Back on my pedestal.

421
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:33,572
Hi, Jonny.

422
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:35,423
I see you met Paula already.

423
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:37,239
Yeah.

424
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:38,799
Is she everything I said?

425
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:40,197
And more.

426
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:42,693
You have a good trip, Kirk?

427
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,552
The only good part was
getting back, honey.

428
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,530
Wait until you two
really get acquainted.

429
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,817
Yeah, I can hardly wait.

430
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,715
I'd really like to know her better.

431
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:53,269
Well, to know her is to love her.

432
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:56,185
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

433
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:00,107
Eve, weren't you amazed to see Kirk?

434
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:01,443
I was.

435
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,561
Nothing the Davis brothers
ever do fazes me.

436
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,842
Do you mind if we use your couch, Jonny?
- No. Not if you don't bounce.

437
00:22:07,398 --> 00:22:09,128
Those springs aren't
what they used to be.

438
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:12,854
Hey, we got to get ourselves a place
to roost. We can't move in on Paula.

439
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:13,893
No?

440
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,132
What do you think?

441
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:17,201
Paula.

442
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,826
Well, three is a crowd.

443
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:22,534
We'll see about making that two, honey.

444
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:25,551
I'll get our stuff over to the
Great Northern. Okay?

445
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,633
I wouldn't think of
crossing you, Junior.

446
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:30,018
How about dinner?

447
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,403
Shall we all go out some place?

448
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:35,652
I got to finish this.

449
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,377
And he can't do it without me.

450
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,450
Me, I've got a story to cover.

451
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,440
Huh?

452
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,278
I'll meet you here at nine.

453
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,773
Okay.

454
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:50,602
Well, I want to get into
something comfortable.

455
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:54,550
See you all later.

456
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:58,076
Well, how do you like her?

457
00:22:58,664 --> 00:22:59,792
So far, so good.

458
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,828
Why didn't you tell me she lived here?
- You didn't give me a chance.

459
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:05,722
You know, you really sold me
a bill of goods today, Jonny.

460
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,516
The newspaper business
and matrimony don't mix.

461
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:11,116
Well, I hope the lady won't
be too disappointed.

462
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:13,495
It's the newspaper
business I'm giving up.

463
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:16,968
I'll let you be flower girl
if Paula doesn't mind.

464
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:18,890
Hey, do I hear wedding bells?

465
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:20,463
Yeah. What goes on?

466
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:23,335
Ah, she's the greatest
girl I ever knew, Jonny.

467
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,045
Honest. Loyal. Straight from
the shoulder. You'll find out.

468
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:28,302
Maybe I have already.

469
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,694
Listen, Junior.
You're a war correspondent.

470
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:33,491
And there is a war going on. Remember?

471
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:35,628
You just can't walk out on it.
- I can.

472
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,506
I got me a steady job all lined up.

473
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:38,472
Yeah?

474
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,544
Oh, listen, Jonny.
Everybody is not like you.

475
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,496
You'd rather be a good reporter than ..

476
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:44,548
Shakespeare.

477
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:46,307
Shakespeare was a reporter.

478
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:47,610
Scooped Queen Elizabeth.

479
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,398
That's the thing to do with dames.

480
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,510
Scoop them but stay away
from orders with them.

481
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,813
Sorry Jonny, but that's
what I want to do.

482
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,183
A man may want to spend ten years
of his life in bed with his hat on.

483
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:59,002
But he can't. History won't let him.

484
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,467
It will let me.

485
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:02,978
Maybe.

486
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,271
But I won't.

487
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,059
See you later, pals.

488
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:12,335
Perhaps we ought to do something
big after we get together again.

489
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:14,266
Kill the fatted calf or something.

490
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:15,460
Don't look at me.

491
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:17,660
I've taken a little weight
but not that much.

492
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,900
We got some presents for you in
our bags as soon as I unpack.

493
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,499
I don't expect much.
Just a diamond bracelet or two.

494
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:29,818
He's a great kid, Jonny.

495
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:31,823
Just giving a bum imitation of you.

496
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:34,915
Can't you see he's got his heart
set on that high-octane upstairs?

497
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:37,755
And you can't expect a Linotype
machine to win out over that, brother.

498
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:40,137
May as well sit back and
nature takes its course.

499
00:24:40,237 --> 00:24:43,229
Listen, Evie. I've looked out for
Junior since he wore short pants.

500
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,613
I don't care what he
does with his weekends.

501
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:48,177
But I do care what he does
with the rest of his life.

502
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,586
But Jonny, you can't ..
- Forget it. Kirk is my problem.

503
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,868
Kirk is Kirk's problem.
Get that through your skull.

504
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:57,105
Oh sure, sure. But I've always
helped the kid with his homework.

505
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,668
I'm a wow at long-division.

506
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:10,205
Particularly when things
don't belong together.

507
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:16,323
Be back later. Got to
cover a fire. A woman's angle.

508
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:18,505
Is that so? You know,
I haven't seen a fire in years.

509
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:20,504
Especially from the woman's angle.

510
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:22,917
Tell Kirk Santa Clause's
house is burning down.

511
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:27,655
How do you like that?

512
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:30,716
The same way I'd like
another twenty pounds waist.

513
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:34,589
I wonder what he's up to.
- I wonder what she's up to.

514
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:37,252
You know something.

515
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,678
I'll bet there ain't no fire.

516
00:25:40,612 --> 00:25:42,085
There will be when they get there.

517
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,439
But look, I've told you ten
times I've got things to do.

518
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:50,520
Sure you have. With me. And doing
Madam Lugovska's is one of them.

519
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,824
You haven't lived until you
have tasted Mama's borscht.

520
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:54,792
Once you have, you're
never the same again.

521
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:56,307
That's what I'm afraid of.

522
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:58,352
Okay, bring on your borscht.

523
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:05,174
Jonny! From the heart, welcome.
- How is the Russian bear?

524
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:07,860
Walking like a man.
Just read the newspapers.

525
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:10,957
Hi, Anatole.

526
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:13,751
Professor Anatole. Astrologer.
Predicted black Friday.

527
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,272
He should have made millions.

528
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:17,417
No. Somebody talked him
out of it. He lost his shirt.

529
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,215
Joshka. How wonderful.

530
00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:26,342
I am so happy to see you.
- Been true to me?

531
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:27,792
True to you? Ha-ha ..

532
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,504
He asks.

533
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:30,704
He is naughty.

534
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:33,129
There are no naughty children.
Only glandular cases.

535
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:34,437
Meet Paula Lane, Mama.

536
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:35,724
How do you do.
- Hello.

537
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:37,037
Always a pretty girl.

538
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:39,295
We'll have drinks in
the little dining room.

539
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:40,666
Joshka, Joshka.

540
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,484
I am very sorry. It cannot be.
It is engaged.

541
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,095
What's the idea? I thought
I had first call on that room.

542
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:47,753
What's the difference where we sit?

543
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:49,787
The difference between
democrats and republicans.

544
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:52,281
Just like old times, the corner table.

545
00:26:53,032 --> 00:26:55,353
Some people are having dinner
in the little dining room.

546
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:57,501
But they can't stay there
all night, Joshka.

547
00:26:57,606 --> 00:26:59,460
No, don't underestimate your customers.

548
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:02,246
Same as usual?

549
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:03,542
For you?

550
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:05,659
The same as his same.
- Oh, that's fine.

551
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,777
But do not agree with him too much.

552
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:15,711
Carlo.

553
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:19,612
Chinese special.

554
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:24,651
Well, what and who ..

555
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:26,654
Have you been doing these lost years?

556
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,924
Lost?
- Yes. You didn't know me.

557
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:33,954
Go on, tell me about yourself.

558
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:36,835
Oh, I've been breathing
in and out and ..

559
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:39,484
Writing little items.
Fires, fashions and ..

560
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:42,491
Alderman's clam-bakes.
- Strive and succeed. Onward and upward.

561
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:44,769
Well, not so far upward.

562
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:46,258
I'm working on it.

563
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:49,264
Jonny.

564
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,235
Thanks, pal.

565
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:54,826
Say, Dorloff.

566
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,700
See what you can do to get those
folks out of my little dining room, huh.

567
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,758
I'll do my best.

568
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:04,490
You don't take me
very seriously, do you.

569
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:06,933
As a girl reporter? I do not.

570
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,661
Stafford does.

571
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:11,146
There is a good chance of him
sending me to the orient.

572
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:12,919
What for? Silk worms?

573
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:15,907
Indochina. A woman correspondent.

574
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:19,193
Don't look so male and superior.

575
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:22,079
I beat the town on ambassador
Zucker's resignation.

576
00:28:22,557 --> 00:28:23,844
What? Was that your story?

577
00:28:24,146 --> 00:28:25,994
How did you get it?
Don't tell me, I know.

578
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:28,172
You rolled your eyes
and crossed your gams.

579
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:31,839
Well, we ..

580
00:28:32,763 --> 00:28:33,813
We danced a little.

581
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,281
For the first time I understand the
ambassador's domestic policy.

582
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:44,508
I'm glad you told me.

583
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:46,802
It wouldn't do to sell you short, baby.

584
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:49,114
Jonny.

585
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,132
I ..

586
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:53,271
It might interest you to know that
the world is coming to an end.

587
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:56,469
Not unless it is tonight.

588
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,867
The stars say it will be April the 7th.

589
00:29:01,564 --> 00:29:02,489
1987.

590
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:04,461
At 5:30 o'clock.

591
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:05,836
Daylight saving time?

592
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,837
That gives us exactly
forty-five and half years.

593
00:29:09,263 --> 00:29:11,365
The way things are going it
won't be a minute too long.

594
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:14,067
Excuse me, professor.

595
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,093
You see, I have him in
the middle of a trance.

596
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:19,985
Oh, pardon me.
I didn't see you had a lady.

597
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,117
You weren't kidding about that trance.

598
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:33,284
You know, I'm working on a patent too.

599
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:34,715
A lie detector.

600
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,225
I'm trying it out on you.

601
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:37,794
How am I doing?

602
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:38,972
Batting a zero.

603
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:42,065
It's a great invention.
It protects a girl in the clinches.

604
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:46,510
Say, what are you?
A baseball player or a prize-fighter?

605
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:48,043
The lingo, I mean.

606
00:29:48,836 --> 00:29:49,477
Oh.

607
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:52,284
My dad, he took care of a lot
of broken-down athletes.

608
00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:54,094
And newspapermen.

609
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,134
Rescue missions?
- Health farm.

610
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:01,509
Well .. here is to health.

611
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,608
I know a couple of fine
ways to improve it.

612
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:16,314
I wonder if Dorloff is making
any headway up there.

613
00:30:18,238 --> 00:30:20,082
Let's see. Where was I?

614
00:30:20,994 --> 00:30:23,797
You weren't anywhere, but you
were trying to get somewhere.

615
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:29,289
There's no question about it.
You are the one.

616
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,461
One what?

617
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,519
The gal I've been thinking
about all these years.

618
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:34,937
Ha!

619
00:30:35,718 --> 00:30:37,236
Just a girl I made up in my mind.

620
00:30:37,637 --> 00:30:38,872
One of my better dreams.

621
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,099
I never thought I'd meet her.

622
00:30:41,985 --> 00:30:44,170
Suddenly a bathroom
door opens and whambo!

623
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:48,705
Any girl that listens to the
howl of a wolf is a goner.

624
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:51,076
Little Red Riding Hood didn't do so bad.

625
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,765
She didn't do so good.

626
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:54,431
Until she got wise.

627
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:57,483
Don't throw curves at me, Jonny.

628
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:00,937
Those aren't exactly angles
you've been tossing at me, baby.

629
00:31:04,717 --> 00:31:06,305
Alright. So, I am a goner.

630
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,265
Tell me some more beautiful fables.

631
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:22,787
Jonny, the lie detector.
It's stopped working.

632
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,040
It blew out a fuse.

633
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:27,232
Oh sweet.

634
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:28,914
Sweet.

635
00:31:31,377 --> 00:31:32,806
The crossroads of the Pacific.

636
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:33,824
Jonny.

637
00:31:34,023 --> 00:31:36,560
The people in the little dining room.
They finish there at three.

638
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,390
This shouldn't happen to a dog.

639
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,035
But I convinced them that dessert
would not be good for them.

640
00:31:42,355 --> 00:31:43,027
Look.

641
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:47,561
Coffee?

642
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:49,134
Maybe.

643
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,833
Excuse me.

644
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,713
Hey buddy, you're going in
the wrong direction, aren't you?

645
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:00,602
No. We are going to have some coffee.
- Oh no. No coffee. Don't think of it.

646
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:02,260
Bad for the nerves. Keeps you awake.

647
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,621
And sleep is just what you need.
The door is that way.

648
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:05,732
Well thank you.

649
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:14,884
What's this?

650
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:17,166
Jonny, I'm glad of that
minute between rounds.

651
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,231
Because I've got just enough sense
left to walk to that door and out.

652
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,286
Sense has nothing to do
with the way we feel.

653
00:32:23,873 --> 00:32:25,975
The thing to do is close
your eyes and let yourself go.

654
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:42,044
Goodbye.

655
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:49,520
She wasn't hungry, Jonny?

656
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,720
She is hungry alright but
I guess she isn't starving.

657
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,093
I don't believe her.

658
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,746
I don't understand women sometimes.

659
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,552
Here is lesson number one.

660
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,335
When you find a blond the right age and
weight who knows the value of suspense.

661
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:03,555
That is bad.

662
00:33:03,696 --> 00:33:05,364
That is too bad.
- It is terrible.

663
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:06,847
My heart bleeds.

664
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:10,336
Whose blond was this, yours or mine?

665
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:21,067
Here is a paper.

666
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,541
Anything in it?
- Not enough.

667
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:31,106
Hey, that fire must have been
hotter than you expected.

668
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,867
You know what I feel like?

669
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:37,279
I feel like I've been riding a bicycle
up and down a rollercoaster track.

670
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:39,765
The bicycle has no handlebars.

671
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:42,575
No brakes either.

672
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:44,963
Well, was it fun?

673
00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:48,111
Yeah. When I wasn't scared to death.

674
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:50,961
Eve.

675
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,161
Were you always dead sure of Willie?

676
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:56,794
I mean, did you want to believe
him more than anything ..

677
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,794
And not quite be able to make it?

678
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:02,637
There was that time with
the redhead next door.

679
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,578
Of course, honey.
I've always been sure of him.

680
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:11,823
Lucky you.

681
00:34:13,372 --> 00:34:14,762
Say, a telegram came for you.

682
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:18,439
What's the matter,
still on that bicycle?

683
00:34:19,117 --> 00:34:19,760
Yeah.

684
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:23,274
Want me to read it for you?

685
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:24,350
Please.

686
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:27,121
Probably somebody opening a
new dry-cleaning establishment.

687
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,575
Say, it is from Stafford.

688
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,598
It's the Indochina job.

689
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,023
You are all set for it.

690
00:34:34,314 --> 00:34:36,474
When do you start packing the
pith helmet and he quinine?

691
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:41,553
I don't think I'm going, Evie.

692
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,317
Not what? Why, it's the
chance of a lifetime.

693
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:46,537
Yeah, that's what I thought.

694
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:48,044
Yesterday.

695
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,044
Before I started this business.

696
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:53,708
Sure.

697
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:56,194
Am I the unromantic old hag.

698
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,524
Of course, you don't want to leave Kirk.

699
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,107
Until you get him good
and married, I mean.

700
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:05,213
Did Kirk tell you that?

701
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:07,853
With gestures and what is
known as a catch in his voice.

702
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:09,896
He is crazy about you, honey.

703
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:13,751
But he kind-of jumped the gun a little.

704
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,213
What's the difference?

705
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,040
You're lucky baby. He is
somebody to tie to. A good risk.

706
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:21,492
Yeah.

707
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:22,846
I know.

708
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:27,881
Now the girl that snares Jonny ..

709
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:30,570
Had better have on good heavy gloves
when she takes him out of the trap.

710
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,939
Why, I thought you liked Jonny.

711
00:35:33,138 --> 00:35:35,368
Like him? I adore the big lunk-head.

712
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:37,433
Everybody does.
That's what's wrong with him.

713
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:40,209
You talk as though he
is little more than human.

714
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:41,929
Oh, he is human alright.

715
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,265
That's my point.

716
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:45,037
Too human.

717
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:48,176
Well, I love humanity.

718
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,452
So does Jonny, one at a time.

719
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:53,388
If he keeps his health he'll
get around to everybody.

720
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:57,075
Eve, I'm all mixed up.

721
00:35:57,306 --> 00:36:00,154
I don't know what to do.
Whether to follow my emotions or ..

722
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,207
Or toss a coin, or what.

723
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:05,626
Kirk or Jonny, eh?

724
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:07,270
Yeah.

725
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:11,982
Heads or tails.

726
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:16,839
Baby, in this case I'd forget about
the emotions. I'd toss that coin.

727
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,882
And be darned sure it comes
up heads and not tails.

728
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,383
Hello everybody.
- Hello.

729
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,786
Where is Willie?
- He's inside taking a bath.

730
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:29,206
I told him he had to get the
paint out from behind his ears.

731
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:30,496
Darling,
- Kirk.

732
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:32,502
Tell him he must put
on a neck-tie too. Here.

733
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,479
Two cravats from Bond Street for him.
- You're an angel, angel.

734
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,897
And for you, Evie.

735
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:39,741
A little French number.
Compliments of the Davis brothers.

736
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,208
Go on, take it. It's kosher.

737
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:45,022
From unoccupied France.

738
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,287
You're a great guy, Kirk.

739
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:54,853
He'll be ready in a minute.

740
00:36:57,379 --> 00:36:59,471
It's about time I had a
minute alone with you.

741
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:01,813
Hey, I got your present here somewhere.

742
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:04,542
I had it.

743
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:10,627
Something for your finger.

744
00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:13,191
Kirk.

745
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:16,347
Don't give that ring to me.

746
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:17,784
Why not?

747
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,459
I'm not right for you.

748
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:21,433
Not right?

749
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,424
Honey, you're everything I want.

750
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,784
The best.

751
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:27,332
No, darling. That's what you are.

752
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:29,855
And just what you want me to be.

753
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:32,459
What do you mean?

754
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,231
Jonny and I went out for
a drink after you left.

755
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:38,757
Fine.

756
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,198
As long as he didn't slip
something in your glass.

757
00:37:41,568 --> 00:37:42,652
He is famous for it.

758
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:46,365
I don't want to hurt you but ..

759
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:49,039
Well.

760
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,535
Suppose you tell me what
you got on your mind.

761
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:56,310
Alright.

762
00:37:57,452 --> 00:37:58,623
It's Jonny.

763
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,401
It's been Jonny for three years.

764
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:03,682
Ever since that first time I saw him.

765
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:05,501
That time he stood you up?

766
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:07,531
Yeah, I know.

767
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:10,322
Oh, I've tried to kid myself out of it.

768
00:38:10,593 --> 00:38:12,651
I told myself that it
was all wide-eyed stuff.

769
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,305
Told myself that he was
all bad news. Poison.

770
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,330
That's where I come in? An antidote?

771
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:19,445
Or did I ever come in at all?
- Oh, Kirk.

772
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:22,582
I think you're the swell-est
person I've ever known.

773
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:25,938
And if Jonny hadn't come back.
If he'd only stayed away.

774
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:28,981
I got to tell you something.

775
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,283
Jonny is a funny egg.

776
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,212
Very funny.

777
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,140
Maybe not his fault.

778
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:39,160
Women have a habit of
throwing themselves at him.

779
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,567
Alright. I've got that coming too.

780
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:45,185
I did throw myself at him today.

781
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,421
I suppose I'll always
throw myself at him.

782
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:50,163
Then just be sure of one thing.

783
00:38:50,682 --> 00:38:52,126
Be sure he is there to catch you.

784
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:53,705
He'll be there.

785
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:56,122
Yeah? Wait until the chips are down.

786
00:38:58,138 --> 00:38:59,325
They are down right now.

787
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:01,268
Stafford wants me to go to Indochina.

788
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,593
Indochina? That's dynamite.

789
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:06,247
I'm not going, Kirk.
Jonny won't let me leave.

790
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:08,423
He won't.

791
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:11,318
You can't care for someone the
way I care for Jonny and have it ..

792
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:13,660
Well, wasted.

793
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:15,070
Can't you?

794
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,388
I'm sorry, Kirk.
- Shut up, will you.

795
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:19,872
Maybe you're right about Jonny.

796
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,104
I don't think so, and I don't hope so.

797
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,475
Please, darling.

798
00:39:24,687 --> 00:39:26,663
I feel like a mule kicked
me right in the stomach.

799
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:29,201
And I'd like to kill Jonny. That's all.

800
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:30,666
I'd like to kill him.

801
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:32,376
Behold us!

802
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:35,577
Kirk, your dress is wonderful.

803
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:37,692
Of course, I did just get my hips in.

804
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:39,956
I think you look pretty demi-mondainey.

805
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:42,833
If I didn't know you didn't know
French, I'd have to slap you, darling.

806
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:44,823
Well, kids.

807
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:47,846
You look elegant. Both of you.

808
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:53,168
Eve and Willie, will you forgive me?
I don't feel like going out tonight.

809
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,949
As a matter of fact I feel out already.

810
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,361
On my feet.

811
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,323
What's the matter with her?

812
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,392
Whatever it is, it's catching.

813
00:40:06,051 --> 00:40:08,549
All of a sudden I've got a headache.
Let's call off the celebration.

814
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:09,922
What do you mean, headache?

815
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:13,271
You just told me you felt like tearing
the town apart with your teeth.

816
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,046
Put in your uppers, Willie.

817
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:17,023
That's just what we're going to do.

818
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,650
Evie and Willie's was never like this.

819
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:36,031
Why didn't you unpack for me?

820
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:44,937
You know, you got the Davis eye, kid.

821
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:47,566
The girl is terrific.
- What girl?

822
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:49,545
Your girl.

823
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:51,640
Sure you don't want to try
and change her status?

824
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:53,651
It might not be too hard.
- No?

825
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:54,939
No.

826
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:00,137
I took her out for a soda.

827
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,744
With bourbon.

828
00:41:02,314 --> 00:41:03,443
We went on from there.

829
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,408
Wound up and Mama Lugovska's.

830
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:09,692
Wound up how? Tight?

831
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:11,209
No. Just wound up.

832
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,569
Well, uncoil. What are
you trying to prove?

833
00:41:14,296 --> 00:41:16,827
That it isn't the world that's round,
it is the heels that walk on it.

834
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:21,294
A guy's a cinch for a new shuffle before
he gets a hand good enough to play.

835
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:23,630
I expect fast shuffles Jonny,
but not from you.

836
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,631
My deal, kid.

837
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:27,148
And I didn't get one from Paula either.
- Give her time. You will.

838
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:30,160
You should know that better than me.
- I should?

839
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,016
Oh.

840
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,519
I saw her after she left you.

841
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:34,867
A two-timer, huh?

842
00:41:35,186 --> 00:41:36,726
She isn't a woman, she's a football.

843
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,909
What's that, a flag you wave?
Or the double standard?

844
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:40,825
When a man is a two-timer
that's just normal.

845
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:42,465
But when a woman is a two-timer ..

846
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,602
She is strong drink and
shouldn't be sold to minors.

847
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,374
I ought to poke you one.
- What for?

848
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,351
If you can't read that babe then
somebody has to do it for you.

849
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:52,291
You want me to spell out the words?
- Spell away.

850
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,213
It rhymes with "champ".

851
00:41:54,536 --> 00:41:56,276
But it means the opposite.
- I ought to ..

852
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:57,962
About here.
- About there.

853
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,081
It still rhymes with "champ", kid.

854
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:05,484
You can't change my mind about Paula.

855
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:06,494
Champ.

856
00:42:12,104 --> 00:42:12,747
Well.

857
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,581
Well then, maybe we'll have to
fix it so the babe changes hers.

858
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:19,643
So long, Jonny. It was
nice being related to you.

859
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:30,727
Hi, Dorloff.

860
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:32,914
I got a date coming up.
How about the ..?

861
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:34,580
Oh, it's all yours today, Jonny.

862
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,415
A date, eh?
- Yeah.

863
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:37,326
A blond?

864
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:38,971
Everybody is blond.

865
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:41,493
Tell Mama to ice up a couple
of bottle of champagne.

866
00:42:41,805 --> 00:42:42,826
Champagne?

867
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:43,799
Jonny.

868
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:46,521
Well the best is none too
good for everybody's blonds.

869
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:47,924
Demand isn't good enough.

870
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:49,824
Jonny.

871
00:42:57,163 --> 00:42:58,750
I suppose I shouldn't have called you.

872
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:00,678
You just beat me to
the telephone, honey.

873
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:03,736
You know, all the way over
here I kept telling myself.

874
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:05,022
Take it easy, Pal.

875
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:07,423
Just a little more
maidenly modesty please.

876
00:43:09,538 --> 00:43:10,960
The little dining room, baby?

877
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:16,811
Ah, the heck with maidenly modesty.

878
00:43:17,186 --> 00:43:18,899
Confidence is what a girl needs.

879
00:43:20,137 --> 00:43:21,370
Any place you say, Jonny.

880
00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:37,868
Remind me to be with you the
next time you pick out a hat.

881
00:43:38,506 --> 00:43:40,751
Why, don't you like this one?
- No. There is too much of it.

882
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:43,322
Hair like that should
be seen not buried.

883
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:49,650
Come here.

884
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:51,179
Why?

885
00:43:51,749 --> 00:43:52,818
You need a reason?

886
00:43:53,822 --> 00:43:54,723
It would help.

887
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:56,833
It's just a step over there but ..

888
00:43:57,584 --> 00:43:58,621
It's a long step.

889
00:43:59,957 --> 00:44:02,013
Where is that confidence
you were talking about?

890
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,754
Alright. I'll give you a reason.

891
00:44:05,848 --> 00:44:07,352
Because it is what you want to do.

892
00:44:08,972 --> 00:44:10,350
It is a long step, Jonny.

893
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:12,323
Isn't there another reason too?

894
00:44:12,685 --> 00:44:14,740
Alright, alright.
Take your pound of flesh.

895
00:44:16,785 --> 00:44:18,300
It's what I want you to do too.

896
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:26,614
I don't suppose you'll ever tell a
girl a thing she needs to hear.

897
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:28,792
There is too much of this coat too.

898
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:31,003
There is a lot more of you
that shouldn't be buried.

899
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,615
I haven't much time, Jonny.

900
00:44:33,934 --> 00:44:35,264
Have you a stop-watch on you?

901
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:37,758
I'm supposed to catch a plane at three.

902
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:39,200
For where, Hoboken?

903
00:44:40,205 --> 00:44:41,764
Stafford has ordered me to Indochina.

904
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:43,526
Stafford is a mental case.

905
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:45,670
Indochina, huh?

906
00:44:46,218 --> 00:44:47,373
That's a long way off.

907
00:44:49,326 --> 00:44:50,913
You don't want me to go, do you Jonny?

908
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,274
Well, I do and I don't.

909
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:58,059
I will take the "do" reasons first.

910
00:44:58,575 --> 00:45:00,534
You are a fire hazard to
some plans that I've got.

911
00:45:02,615 --> 00:45:05,249
A woman doesn't always tie a man down.

912
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:08,666
Now, why don't you want me to go?

913
00:45:11,988 --> 00:45:13,378
It would be nice to have a row.

914
00:45:15,656 --> 00:45:17,100
Even you can do better than that.

915
00:45:17,804 --> 00:45:19,391
Surely that isn't all you have to say.

916
00:45:21,476 --> 00:45:22,062
No.

917
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:24,100
I got something else to say, honey.

918
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:34,172
Goodbye. A pleasant trip.

919
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:37,044
Goodbye?

920
00:45:39,341 --> 00:45:41,508
That Indochina job is a big opportunity.

921
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,772
I can't ask you to pass it up.

922
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:47,455
But Jonny, you just said I'd
be nice to have around.

923
00:45:47,984 --> 00:45:49,113
For a couple of weeks.

924
00:45:52,204 --> 00:45:53,276
So that's how it is.

925
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:55,838
For a couple of weeks?
- That's how it is.

926
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:59,140
I can say it in six languages but why
make it tough for you to understand?

927
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:02,909
In what language was that kiss?

928
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,831
The universal language, baby.

929
00:46:05,454 --> 00:46:07,184
And don't tell me you
need an interpreter.

930
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:10,625
Did I interrupt anything?

931
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,099
Unfortunately, not a thing.

932
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:15,784
Will you join me, Dorloff?

933
00:46:16,876 --> 00:46:19,017
But the lady?
The champagne was for the lady.

934
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:20,478
It wasn't needed.

935
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,671
The lady is just leaving.

936
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:26,663
To the Far East, isn't it?

937
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,140
This I do not understand.

938
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:44,693
Once, she leaves.
Once, you throw her out.

939
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,169
And obviously you desire to be together.

940
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:49,875
"Desire" is the word.

941
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:53,076
Here is something to paste
in your hat my friend.

942
00:46:54,051 --> 00:46:56,722
You can't have your angel cake
and send her to Indochina too.

943
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:04,734
Where to, Miss?
- China.

944
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:45,126
Hello Jonny.

945
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,101
Where have you been the last month?

946
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,391
Among the unemployed.

947
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:50,239
I've also been to Grant's tomb.

948
00:47:50,857 --> 00:47:52,808
The Bronx Zoo and the Aquarium. Twice.

949
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,203
You'd be surprised how
many fish they got there.

950
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,974
Most of them look like Papa.

951
00:47:57,683 --> 00:47:59,462
Oh, go on in and kiss and make up.

952
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:01,781
I'm glad to see the two of you back.

953
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:04,048
Two of us?

954
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:05,694
Sure. Your brother is in there now.

955
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:07,696
Say, what is wrong between you and Kirk?

956
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:10,259
When I told him you'd be
here he acted the same way.

957
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,798
Like something bit him.

958
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:14,276
Where, honey?

959
00:48:18,326 --> 00:48:19,230
Hello Junior.

960
00:48:20,717 --> 00:48:23,375
Oh, you look fine.
Like a collapsed dachshund.

961
00:48:24,255 --> 00:48:25,098
Hello Jonny.

962
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,434
Davis, I've told all this to Kirk. I'll
be brief. He'll give you details later.

963
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:41,951
As you know The Chronicle
sent Paula Lane to Indochina.

964
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:43,464
A master-stroke.

965
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:45,786
She is missing. Disappeared completely.

966
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,746
We've tried every way
we know to find her.

967
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:49,777
Did you get in touch with
Floyd Kirsten in Hanoi?

968
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:51,400
Kirsten? That has-been.

969
00:48:51,748 --> 00:48:53,831
He couldn't find his bottle
if it was in his hand.

970
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:55,453
Okay, I just asked.

971
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,234
Now, I'm worried about Paula.

972
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,892
There just might be a
little trouble with Japan.

973
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:02,120
Honest?

974
00:49:03,366 --> 00:49:06,371
You'd better rush that tip
over to the State Department.

975
00:49:07,389 --> 00:49:08,690
The long and short of it is.

976
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:11,497
I want you two boys to go to
Hanoi and find Paula Lane.

977
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:17,816
It wouldn't be that you want some decent
coverage for The Chronicle, would it?

978
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,704
Let me handle this alone, Chief.

979
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:21,028
Sorry, boy.

980
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:22,784
In fairness to The Chronicle I can't.

981
00:49:22,884 --> 00:49:24,271
You couldn't pull it off alone.

982
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,563
With Jonny you might.

983
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:28,644
He's the kind who gets things done,
no matter who he has to walk on.

984
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:29,982
Yeah.

985
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:31,838
You are right about that.

986
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:37,570
Well, when do you start for Hanoi?

987
00:49:40,265 --> 00:49:41,662
You're sure I'm starting, huh?

988
00:49:42,528 --> 00:49:43,600
That's right, Davis.

989
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:46,564
I know the spot you're in
because I put you there.

990
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,040
You are broke.

991
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,133
No other paper will touch
you with a ten-foot pole.

992
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:51,750
I've got you tied up for two years.

993
00:49:52,003 --> 00:49:53,961
And you'd rather be dead
than out of the business.

994
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:55,829
So.

995
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:57,962
When do you start for Hanoi?

996
00:50:00,517 --> 00:50:01,675
How's your feet, Chief?

997
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:03,343
Bad.

998
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:04,876
I mean your paper's feet.

999
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:06,484
Cold, as usual?

1000
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,519
You send in your dispatches.

1001
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:10,407
I'll print them the way I see them.

1002
00:50:10,671 --> 00:50:12,130
I thought so. Very cold.

1003
00:50:13,826 --> 00:50:15,910
You know what cold feet
causes on a newspaper, Chief?

1004
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,518
Poor circulation.

1005
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:19,481
Or is it the other way around?

1006
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:22,977
You are not going to bring up my
editorial policy again, are you?

1007
00:50:23,822 --> 00:50:25,872
You don't expect me to keep
it on my stomach, do you?

1008
00:50:25,983 --> 00:50:27,325
Alright, Davis.

1009
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:28,989
We don't like each other.

1010
00:50:29,288 --> 00:50:31,109
But we work together. Huh?

1011
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:34,044
Sure.

1012
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:36,923
Necessity is the mother
of strange bedfellows.

1013
00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:38,364
Eh, Junior?

1014
00:50:39,108 --> 00:50:40,409
Do I put you on the payroll?

1015
00:50:41,652 --> 00:50:42,295
Yeah.

1016
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,469
As of when you took us off.

1017
00:50:46,662 --> 00:50:48,322
It's a deal. How about you, Kirk?

1018
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:49,515
I'm set.

1019
00:50:49,615 --> 00:50:51,393
Oh sure. Everybody is set.

1020
00:50:52,028 --> 00:50:54,388
Don't you worry, Chief. I'll find
a way to get the news printed.

1021
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,340
How? Taking along a hand-press?

1022
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:59,785
You'll learn you can't toss me
around like a badminton ball, Davis.

1023
00:51:01,046 --> 00:51:02,969
They don't play badminton
with a ball, Chief.

1024
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:04,543
They use what is known as a bird.

1025
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,803
You ought to know what that is.
You get it enough.

1026
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,783
More Japanese beetles round here than
you'd see in a California lettuce patch.

1027
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:35,283
Did we come here worry
about Indochina or find Paula?

1028
00:51:35,777 --> 00:51:38,482
I don't know about you. I'm here
to gather news buds while I may.

1029
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:44,039
Yes, sir. Than you would find
in a California lettuce patch.

1030
00:51:44,259 --> 00:51:45,732
What kind of a guy are you anyway?

1031
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,710
Paula is a fellow
newspaperman if nothing else.

1032
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:49,623
For my dough she is nothing else too.

1033
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,971
Are you through trying all the places
that wouldn't know where she is?

1034
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:55,487
Yeah.
- Okay.

1035
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:56,972
Hey, cab.

1036
00:51:57,744 --> 00:51:59,388
Now I'll take you to a place that might.

1037
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:04,021
You see Junior, in every town there is
one guy who knows who's where and why.

1038
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:06,209
I suppose you mean Floyd Kirsten?
- That's right.

1039
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:08,648
Stafford told us about him.
He's all washed up and a lush too.

1040
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:11,403
Maybe, but Kirsten knows more
drunk that Papa does sober.

1041
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,038
Nothing like a little
protective occupation.

1042
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:21,283
Identification.

1043
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:28,709
Passports please.

1044
00:52:46,784 --> 00:52:47,566
Excuse.

1045
00:52:48,338 --> 00:52:49,096
Go ahead.

1046
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:50,369
So sorry.

1047
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:52,069
So sorry?

1048
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:54,858
The only thing they're sorry about
is that they can't pull those triggers.

1049
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:55,956
Yet.

1050
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:58,797
Come on, buster. Get going before
they ask to see our birthmarks.

1051
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:07,232
Thank you.

1052
00:53:07,332 --> 00:53:09,727
I hope you're not wasting our time.
- I'm not wasting my time.

1053
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:13,695
I'll say one thing for Paula. She sure
made this disappearance act look good.

1054
00:53:13,795 --> 00:53:16,298
You think she's pulling a fast one, eh?
- I think she's a smart dame.

1055
00:53:16,606 --> 00:53:19,364
Pretends to get herself in a jam so that
some sap will come tearing after her.

1056
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:21,174
That's you.
- So why help me find her?

1057
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:21,975
Simple.

1058
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,831
Sooner you see she's a phony, the sooner
you take other kinds of nourishment.

1059
00:53:27,216 --> 00:53:27,841
Yes?

1060
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:29,328
We'd like to see Floyd Kirsten.

1061
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:31,740
We are old friends.
- Friends?

1062
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:34,342
You are the first of your
race to come for a long time.

1063
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:35,582
You are welcome.

1064
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:36,835
Thank you.

1065
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:38,611
Please.

1066
00:53:48,737 --> 00:53:49,695
Get set, Junior.

1067
00:53:49,939 --> 00:53:51,698
You are about to see
a legend in the flesh.

1068
00:53:51,836 --> 00:53:54,606
A real old-timer. From the
school of Richard Harding Davis.

1069
00:54:02,563 --> 00:54:03,407
Hello Floyd.

1070
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:08,019
Jonny Davis, Floyd.

1071
00:54:09,504 --> 00:54:11,897
Originator of the Hong Kong
hay ride. Remember?

1072
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:14,804
Jonny Davis?

1073
00:54:14,904 --> 00:54:16,445
Well, I must say.

1074
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,713
So must I.

1075
00:54:17,957 --> 00:54:19,172
This is my brother, Kirk.

1076
00:54:20,295 --> 00:54:21,596
I'm glad to know you, son.

1077
00:54:21,994 --> 00:54:23,696
It's a privilege to
know you, Mr Kirsten.

1078
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:24,954
I've read your stuff.

1079
00:54:26,098 --> 00:54:27,355
Not lately, I'm afraid.

1080
00:54:28,548 --> 00:54:31,358
Well, it's been a long time
between by-lines, Jonny.

1081
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:34,562
My paper has about
given up on me I guess.

1082
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:36,938
Won't you sit down, gentlemen?
- Thank you.

1083
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:38,476
Forgive me, Thomas.

1084
00:54:39,016 --> 00:54:40,420
This is Thomas Chang.

1085
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:42,846
He has been very kind to me.

1086
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:45,689
He has cared for me here in his house.

1087
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:47,250
My house is yours.

1088
00:54:47,828 --> 00:54:48,670
Excuse me.

1089
00:54:49,984 --> 00:54:52,589
You see Jonny, I've kinda
lost touch with things.

1090
00:54:54,383 --> 00:54:55,524
I don't write anymore.

1091
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,801
I can see stories but
I can't write them.

1092
00:55:00,189 --> 00:55:01,233
Maybe I'm finished.

1093
00:55:02,337 --> 00:55:05,295
I sort of get buck fever
when I see a typewriter.

1094
00:55:06,572 --> 00:55:07,849
Buck fever, my eye.

1095
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:10,174
What are you talking about?
You look great, Floyd.

1096
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,799
Thanks, you liar.

1097
00:55:12,782 --> 00:55:15,308
Mr Kirsten, can you help us?
We're trying to find Paula Lane.

1098
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:17,721
She was sent over here
by The Chronicle and ..

1099
00:55:18,459 --> 00:55:20,614
And we thought since you
know everybody in Hanoi that ..

1100
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:27,859
The Japs have taken
over here completely.

1101
00:55:29,188 --> 00:55:30,403
They've invaded Thailand.

1102
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:33,489
Thailand can't resist. Not for long.

1103
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:38,064
You can't tight tanks with bows and ..

1104
00:55:39,656 --> 00:55:40,447
Arrows.

1105
00:55:40,732 --> 00:55:41,461
Can you?

1106
00:55:42,932 --> 00:55:43,785
Can I help?

1107
00:55:44,103 --> 00:55:44,776
Ming.

1108
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:47,043
These attacks are common.
- Will he be alright?

1109
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:48,566
We know how to care for him.

1110
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,197
Take Mr Kirsten to his room.

1111
00:55:50,498 --> 00:55:52,120
Call his doctor.
- Yes, Mr Chang.

1112
00:55:53,408 --> 00:55:55,489
Looks like you're the one
that drew a blank this time.

1113
00:55:55,604 --> 00:55:57,083
Perhaps if you came back later?

1114
00:55:57,346 --> 00:55:58,905
This way, gentlemen.
- No, Mr Chang.

1115
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:00,305
This way.

1116
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:04,357
You know, Junior. I think Mr Chang
has something to talk about.

1117
00:56:05,267 --> 00:56:07,438
Now for instance, the Japanese beetles.

1118
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:10,680
Do you or do you not believe
in pest control, Mr Chang?

1119
00:56:10,877 --> 00:56:11,863
Take either side.

1120
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,367
Which side do you take, Mr Davis?

1121
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,813
I'm for it. I don't like
vermin of any kind.

1122
00:56:19,284 --> 00:56:19,997
Now.

1123
00:56:20,237 --> 00:56:21,338
How about Paula Lane?

1124
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:24,217
Why do you want to find her?
- We think she's in a jam.

1125
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:26,442
We're friends of hers.
If that is why you're stalling.

1126
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,520
If you know Mr Kirsten.

1127
00:56:28,905 --> 00:56:30,240
That is probably true.

1128
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,926
Come on. Where is she?

1129
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:33,849
She has been helping Mr Kirsten.

1130
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:36,567
She is now at the frontier,
about 200 miles from here.

1131
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:38,153
The frontier? It's trouble, Jonny.

1132
00:56:38,253 --> 00:56:40,366
It is. And it is very unwise
for me to talk about it.

1133
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:42,078
It's still more unwise not to.

1134
00:56:42,642 --> 00:56:45,231
If we start crashing up and down
the frontier we'll make a lot of noise.

1135
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:48,061
You do believe we're on your
side, don't you Mr Chang?

1136
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,289
Yes, I do.

1137
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:52,229
Otherwise I would send you away.

1138
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:53,759
Then why the mystery?

1139
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,878
If we find her you will see.

1140
00:56:56,308 --> 00:56:57,437
If we do not find her.

1141
00:56:57,885 --> 00:56:59,749
Then it will do her no
good for you to know.

1142
00:57:00,107 --> 00:57:04,525
So there will be two less people who can
speak in the wrong place about our plan.

1143
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:07,131
No, Mr Chang.

1144
00:57:07,696 --> 00:57:08,711
Three less people.

1145
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:29,254
It is three miles to the river.

1146
00:57:29,354 --> 00:57:30,627
On the other side is China.

1147
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,644
We are in luck. They are
going away from the river.

1148
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:47,943
What about that patrol?

1149
00:58:48,227 --> 00:58:50,043
They won't be back this
way for half an hour.

1150
00:59:00,421 --> 00:59:01,705
What the wigwag?

1151
00:59:02,107 --> 00:59:03,151
I can tell you now.

1152
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,627
They're bringing Chinese children out
of the war zone into French territory.

1153
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:08,138
There is the boat.

1154
00:59:13,523 --> 00:59:14,939
It looks like they are expected.

1155
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,915
I will go first and tell
them you are friends.

1156
00:59:28,703 --> 00:59:31,492
Isn't it just as dangerous for the kids
over here with all those Japs around?

1157
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:34,398
Once they are smuggled
in they'll have a chance.

1158
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:36,180
At least he won't have to duck bombs.

1159
00:59:40,629 --> 00:59:41,358
Come on.

1160
00:59:48,684 --> 00:59:51,379
Shush, children. Quiet.
You must be very quiet.

1161
00:59:52,702 --> 00:59:53,907
That's Paula alright.

1162
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,463
Paula.

1163
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:05,194
Gee, it's good to see you.

1164
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:06,783
Are you alright, honey?
- Yeah.

1165
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,941
Oh, you've brought your
big brother too, huh?

1166
01:00:13,617 --> 01:00:14,861
Here, let me take buggins.

1167
01:00:25,476 --> 01:00:27,661
Well, did Stafford send you
over here for silk worms?

1168
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,231
What are you trying to do,
get your name in the paper?

1169
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:32,394
Here, here. Let me do that.

1170
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,955
Stick around and I'll
give you an interview.

1171
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:39,395
A nice way to get shot. Smuggling
Chinese kids across the border.

1172
01:00:39,576 --> 01:00:41,888
What is a border?
Just an imaginary line.

1173
01:00:48,508 --> 01:00:49,695
Let us take over, honey.

1174
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:50,755
Here. Take this.

1175
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:54,229
Is this the last load?

1176
01:00:54,766 --> 01:00:56,253
Yeah. Yeah we got them all.

1177
01:01:09,387 --> 01:01:10,791
You mislaid a couple.

1178
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:21,659
All set. Where do they go?
- A little mission down the river.

1179
01:01:21,907 --> 01:01:25,351
Miow will guide them. She's guided many
such groups. There's less risk that way.

1180
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,534
Miow.

1181
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:38,384
What did you expect to
do with the cannon?

1182
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,280
I expect it to shoot anybody
that tries to stop me.

1183
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:43,025
You act like these are your kids.

1184
01:01:43,713 --> 01:01:46,941
I think when children are in trouble
they become everybody's kids.

1185
01:01:53,288 --> 01:01:54,639
You could be right, babe.

1186
01:01:58,591 --> 01:01:59,712
Alright, let's go.

1187
01:02:00,431 --> 01:02:02,243
The "sooner I find out
she's a phony", huh?

1188
01:02:08,577 --> 01:02:09,935
Are you sure she will be okay?

1189
01:02:10,112 --> 01:02:12,598
Of course. Very fatigued. Strain.

1190
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:14,761
But she just lies there.
Doesn't even move.

1191
01:02:15,219 --> 01:02:16,634
I give her a sleeping powder.

1192
01:02:17,558 --> 01:02:19,422
It won't wear off for some time.

1193
01:02:20,419 --> 01:02:22,139
But there is nothing to worry about.

1194
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:24,572
Who's worried?

1195
01:02:25,146 --> 01:02:25,961
I gather ..

1196
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:27,122
You are.

1197
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:28,713
Mister Davis.

1198
01:02:50,497 --> 01:02:53,075
Look, look, look. You've
got your thumb in her eye.

1199
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,512
This isn't man's work anyway.

1200
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,169
Here .. start that story
about Thailand falling ..

1201
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,404
And the Japs will be there
before you get it written.

1202
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:23,651
Hey, Ming.

1203
01:03:24,995 --> 01:03:25,981
Front and center.

1204
01:03:26,273 --> 01:03:27,548
How is Kirsten?
- Resting.

1205
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:29,607
That's fine. Look, take
over here honey, will you.

1206
01:03:29,983 --> 01:03:31,845
Give the lady a good
wash and polish job.

1207
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:36,633
A pretty girl. For a white woman.

1208
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:39,710
She looks like a piece of
cheese the rats have been at.

1209
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:46,867
How you coming with the literature?

1210
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:48,955
The story writes itself.
I'm just feeding it paper.

1211
01:03:49,235 --> 01:03:50,078
A good diet.

1212
01:03:50,669 --> 01:03:51,942
Only if it writes itself ..

1213
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:54,758
You'd better tell it to write to spell
"perfidy" with an "e" and not a "u".

1214
01:03:55,674 --> 01:03:56,390
Thanks.

1215
01:03:56,597 --> 01:03:58,728
Still great at spelling out
the words for me aren't you.

1216
01:04:02,156 --> 01:04:03,885
Ming, Ming. Gently does it.

1217
01:04:07,045 --> 01:04:08,689
The kid looks like she might break easy.

1218
01:04:09,448 --> 01:04:13,668
When you get that epic finished, you
can tack Floyd Kirsten's name onto it.

1219
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,136
You figure it belongs to him?

1220
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:18,162
No. I figure it belongs to
anybody who can read.

1221
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:21,951
No, no. Here, here.

1222
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:24,865
Let me do it. You're not getting
her ears clean. Get the bed ready.

1223
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,364
I always like women with
their forehead showing.

1224
01:04:49,674 --> 01:04:51,824
Mine never had any to
show about the eyebrows.

1225
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:53,479
Kirsten's name on this, huh?

1226
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:54,339
Yeah.

1227
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:55,834
That's what I said.

1228
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:57,869
Kirsten's name.

1229
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,409
Send it to his office.

1230
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,368
Not to our office, his office.

1231
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:05,992
I thought you were
vaccinated against nobility.

1232
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:09,555
Would you recognise a
needle when you see it?

1233
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:12,306
I might, if I got the point.

1234
01:05:14,004 --> 01:05:15,305
Stafford will get the point.

1235
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:17,668
Right in his editorial policy.

1236
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:25,827
I told him I'd get the news printed.
- Yeah.

1237
01:05:26,202 --> 01:05:28,655
Kirsten gets a by-line and
Stafford gets crossed.

1238
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:30,688
A beautiful double play.

1239
01:05:31,484 --> 01:05:32,327
Triple play.

1240
01:05:32,904 --> 01:05:34,203
The public gets the truth.

1241
01:05:37,569 --> 01:05:38,727
Not a bad guy, Kirsten.

1242
01:05:39,424 --> 01:05:40,753
He was a good reporter once.

1243
01:05:42,247 --> 01:05:44,187
Which is more than I can
say for you, towhead.

1244
01:05:45,326 --> 01:05:47,085
Some people might want
to vote her a medal.

1245
01:05:47,646 --> 01:05:48,443
What for?

1246
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:50,201
Running out on her job?

1247
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:52,950
Playing dry nurse to a
bunch of wet smacks.

1248
01:05:56,849 --> 01:06:00,123
It took a stiff-backed bone at that to
walk up and spit in the Mikado's eye.

1249
01:06:03,383 --> 01:06:04,391
Bed ready now.

1250
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:05,726
Yep. Alright.

1251
01:06:34,045 --> 01:06:36,231
Okay, honey. I'll call
you when I need you.

1252
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:39,011
A pretty girl, for a white woman.

1253
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:40,846
Yeah. You are pretty in any language.

1254
01:06:57,544 --> 01:06:58,931
"Pretty" isn't the word for it.

1255
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,794
What kind of cheese?

1256
01:07:05,237 --> 01:07:07,339
I was wrong about you being
the cheese. You're the rat.

1257
01:07:09,509 --> 01:07:11,302
You put one over on me
about your hair too.

1258
01:07:12,175 --> 01:07:12,811
How?

1259
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:14,484
You said it used to be red.

1260
01:07:15,367 --> 01:07:16,783
Well, how do you know it wasn't?

1261
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:18,622
You've been away from
peroxide for weeks.

1262
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:20,371
No dark roots.

1263
01:07:22,362 --> 01:07:23,835
So a girl couldn't fool you, huh?

1264
01:07:24,622 --> 01:07:25,666
Not more than once.

1265
01:07:26,535 --> 01:07:28,165
But that once was a good once.

1266
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:30,968
I heard every word you said out there.

1267
01:07:32,355 --> 01:07:33,713
Why didn't you open your eyes?

1268
01:07:34,075 --> 01:07:36,034
Because it sounded better
when I couldn't see you.

1269
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,026
Making love always
sounds better in the dark.

1270
01:07:41,396 --> 01:07:42,611
Is that what I was doing?

1271
01:07:44,205 --> 01:07:44,961
Sure.

1272
01:07:45,947 --> 01:07:46,991
Didn't you know it?

1273
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,940
No lying, no fancy language.

1274
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:52,485
I don't use fancy language
when I'm balling somebody out.

1275
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,690
Or when you're spilling
water down a girl's neck.

1276
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:58,881
Oh, you big, clumsy cluck.

1277
01:08:01,585 --> 01:08:03,203
Now I know why you came to Indochina.

1278
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:04,934
You had me worried.

1279
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,688
Well, let me in on the secret.
I won't tell a soul.

1280
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:10,606
You wouldn't know a
soul if it wore a halo.

1281
01:08:11,303 --> 01:08:12,518
I'll tell you why I came.

1282
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,556
To count the 400 million Chinese.

1283
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:18,791
Well, I suppose it was to find you.

1284
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:22,596
Hey listen, I came here
to write news, not make it.

1285
01:08:23,112 --> 01:08:25,192
Stop squirming, Jonny. It's no use.

1286
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,964
You're stuck with me just as
much as I'm stuck with you.

1287
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:30,800
How much is that?

1288
01:08:31,902 --> 01:08:33,124
Well how far is up?

1289
01:08:34,032 --> 01:08:35,161
It's the works, Jonny.

1290
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:43,340
You know something?

1291
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:44,809
My nose itches.

1292
01:08:46,113 --> 01:08:47,901
Didn't that mean something
when I was a kid?

1293
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:49,982
Hmm .. it still does.

1294
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:54,015
When your nose itches, it means
you're going to kiss a fool.

1295
01:09:02,126 --> 01:09:04,320
Want to read this? Or do you trust me?

1296
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,577
Get your face organised, honey.

1297
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,641
Why don't you say something?

1298
01:09:38,944 --> 01:09:40,570
Well, maybe I shouldn't kick.

1299
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,015
We found her.

1300
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:44,213
I'd still rather have her safe than ..

1301
01:09:44,683 --> 01:09:45,828
Just have her.

1302
01:09:48,495 --> 01:09:51,068
What am I supposed to do now?
Hang around and catch her on the bounce?

1303
01:09:51,669 --> 01:09:52,504
Sure.

1304
01:09:52,795 --> 01:09:54,897
The higher she bounces the
easier she is to catch, huh?

1305
01:09:55,265 --> 01:09:57,000
You tell me, Jonny. You're the expert.

1306
01:09:57,607 --> 01:09:59,223
You always bounce them high, don't you.

1307
01:09:59,626 --> 01:10:01,343
You know that little bar on 51st Street?

1308
01:10:01,443 --> 01:10:03,996
The one with the saloon on one side
and the beer parlor on the other?

1309
01:10:04,502 --> 01:10:06,053
Yeah, I know the place.
- Good.

1310
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:07,866
Meet me there sometime.

1311
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:10,152
I don't get you.

1312
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:12,374
Yeah, sure you do.

1313
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:14,256
You had me right all along.

1314
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,919
This is the bounce, Junior.
The high bounce.

1315
01:10:17,612 --> 01:10:18,598
What about Paula?

1316
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:21,317
You were just kissing her
goodbye in there I suppose?

1317
01:10:21,462 --> 01:10:23,043
I always kiss goodbye. It's polite.

1318
01:10:23,424 --> 01:10:24,582
Not the way you did it.

1319
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:26,559
Now I get it.

1320
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:29,125
You finished the job you
started out to do, didn't you.

1321
01:10:29,436 --> 01:10:30,429
What job is that?

1322
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:32,384
You fix it so I never
have a chance with her.

1323
01:10:32,484 --> 01:10:33,954
Old "follow-through" Davis.

1324
01:10:37,331 --> 01:10:38,345
Goodbye, Junior.

1325
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:39,441
Wait a minute.

1326
01:10:40,809 --> 01:10:42,240
I got to kiss you goodbye.

1327
01:10:53,585 --> 01:10:56,200
And you forgot something else, Junior.
You forgot to say thanks.

1328
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:57,257
For what?

1329
01:10:57,372 --> 01:10:59,167
The knife between my
first and second ribs?

1330
01:10:59,396 --> 01:11:01,134
For the information
I'm about to give you.

1331
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,925
You and that babe in
there belong together.

1332
01:11:04,194 --> 01:11:05,283
Like mush and milk.

1333
01:11:06,551 --> 01:11:08,008
Yes, sir. She is the milk.

1334
01:11:08,786 --> 01:11:11,035
One hundred percent pure.
Suitable for young and old.

1335
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:13,916
You are the mush, Junior.

1336
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:20,414
Jonny.

1337
01:11:22,038 --> 01:11:23,530
It's no use, Jonny. It won't work.

1338
01:11:23,972 --> 01:11:26,217
If I needed any proof I got it
when I walked into that room.

1339
01:11:26,507 --> 01:11:27,150
What?

1340
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:29,950
Oh, that. Say, listen, kid.

1341
01:11:30,193 --> 01:11:32,896
People kiss the Blarney Stone every day
but they don't remember it for long.

1342
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:34,570
She'll remember you.

1343
01:11:34,897 --> 01:11:36,255
Until the next guy kisses her.

1344
01:11:36,465 --> 01:11:37,366
The right guy.

1345
01:11:38,137 --> 01:11:39,610
If you're smart, that will be you.

1346
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,578
Listen kid, you've got just
what that babe is looking for.

1347
01:11:42,747 --> 01:11:43,936
The "forever" set up.

1348
01:11:45,446 --> 01:11:48,288
I know. If I'm wrong I've
wasted years of research.

1349
01:11:51,424 --> 01:11:53,089
You're leaving, Mr Davis?
- Yes, Chang.

1350
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:54,854
Thanks for the use of the hall.
- What?

1351
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:56,190
Never mind.

1352
01:11:59,888 --> 01:12:01,275
A gentleman is waiting for you.

1353
01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:03,954
He is no gentleman,
but I'm glad he's waiting.

1354
01:12:04,806 --> 01:12:05,878
Well, how do I look?

1355
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:08,057
Pretty .. for a white woman.

1356
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,993
You now it is awful to want to
knock a man right on his ear and ..

1357
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:13,820
Not have all the weapons to do it with.

1358
01:12:24,137 --> 01:12:24,946
He's gone.

1359
01:12:28,315 --> 01:12:29,857
Well .. is she coming back?

1360
01:12:31,244 --> 01:12:32,087
He said not.

1361
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:40,226
Well, how do you like that.

1362
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:43,597
How do you like it?

1363
01:12:45,638 --> 01:12:47,304
And I threw myself at him again.

1364
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:50,551
Once more, he wasn't there to catch me.

1365
01:12:54,767 --> 01:12:56,887
Wouldn't you think I'd
get used to my bruises?

1366
01:12:59,387 --> 01:13:00,483
Now don't, honey.

1367
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:02,482
He's a funny guy.
- Funny?

1368
01:13:02,843 --> 01:13:03,915
Sure, he's funny.

1369
01:13:04,281 --> 01:13:06,450
He kills people. Kills them dead.

1370
01:13:08,197 --> 01:13:09,314
Only he is sweet too.

1371
01:13:10,028 --> 01:13:12,074
No more harm in him than a cobra.

1372
01:13:18,388 --> 01:13:19,052
Look.

1373
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:22,717
All that moisture will
wrinkle your suit.

1374
01:13:25,971 --> 01:13:26,729
You know.

1375
01:13:27,061 --> 01:13:29,641
A little while ago I was so excited
that I didn't have any mascara.

1376
01:13:31,226 --> 01:13:33,932
It's a good think I didn't, because
I would be an awful mess now.

1377
01:13:35,827 --> 01:13:36,477
Here.

1378
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:44,430
I don't believe it.

1379
01:13:45,433 --> 01:13:48,850
I just don't believe that you can
belong to the same family as that ..

1380
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:50,862
That ..

1381
01:14:29,659 --> 01:14:30,437
Yes, sir?

1382
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:33,377
Champagne in a beer glass and
lace it with Irish whiskey please.

1383
01:14:33,976 --> 01:14:34,734
Yes, sir.

1384
01:14:38,749 --> 01:14:39,957
I'm really intrigued.

1385
01:14:40,233 --> 01:14:42,464
What do you call that dreadful mixture?

1386
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,590
The scientists tell me
it's called an Irish Male.

1387
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:51,169
Spelled M-A-L-E I presume?

1388
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:53,948
It should be if it isn't.

1389
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:56,136
It sounds rather potent.

1390
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:57,422
No, not at all.

1391
01:14:57,682 --> 01:14:58,983
Light as a breath of spring.

1392
01:14:59,156 --> 01:15:01,282
Two quick ones and you
can hear the banshees wail.

1393
01:15:03,297 --> 01:15:05,789
Do you start drinking at noon every day?
- Of course not.

1394
01:15:06,151 --> 01:15:08,183
I start earlier on Saturdays.
- Why?

1395
01:15:08,431 --> 01:15:09,832
I'm thirstier on Saturdays.

1396
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,127
Odd. I'm always thirstier on Sundays.

1397
01:15:14,682 --> 01:15:16,169
What day is this?
- Sunday, sir.

1398
01:15:16,269 --> 01:15:17,268
What'll you have?

1399
01:15:17,368 --> 01:15:18,776
I'd like to try one of those ..

1400
01:15:19,178 --> 01:15:20,094
Irish Males.

1401
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:23,918
The lady will have an Irish Male.

1402
01:15:24,846 --> 01:15:27,211
Spelled M-A-I-L.

1403
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:33,143
You're wasting your time, honey.
I'm down to my last twenty bucks.

1404
01:15:33,801 --> 01:15:35,979
Well In my country we
have an old saying.

1405
01:15:36,318 --> 01:15:37,481
Money isn't everything.

1406
01:15:38,271 --> 01:15:39,209
Your country?

1407
01:15:39,904 --> 01:15:42,162
When I'm home my address is Park Avenue.

1408
01:15:42,749 --> 01:15:44,322
10-1 it was Brooklyn first.

1409
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:47,815
I haven't got it tattooed
on my any place have I?

1410
01:15:49,266 --> 01:15:51,473
Not in any place that shows.
- Then how did you peg me?

1411
01:15:51,717 --> 01:15:52,646
I'm a linguist.

1412
01:15:53,031 --> 01:15:54,975
If that means near-sighted
I'd go along with you.

1413
01:15:55,463 --> 01:15:57,336
You know, I've seen you
around here for a week.

1414
01:15:57,566 --> 01:15:59,041
But I'm darned if you've seen me.

1415
01:15:59,932 --> 01:16:01,369
I'm beginning to wonder why.

1416
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:03,012
Simple. You never looked.

1417
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,078
I'm looking now.

1418
01:16:06,887 --> 01:16:07,960
Like what you see?

1419
01:16:10,211 --> 01:16:10,960
Sure.

1420
01:16:11,573 --> 01:16:14,021
You're as pretty as a picture
in a fifty-cent magazine.

1421
01:16:14,746 --> 01:16:16,848
Then why the chill? I don't get it.

1422
01:16:17,644 --> 01:16:18,573
I don't either.

1423
01:16:19,494 --> 01:16:21,223
My other reflexes seem okay.

1424
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:24,781
Look, if being broke is slowing you
down, I know where you can get a job.

1425
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,375
Let me tell you something, babe.

1426
01:16:27,109 --> 01:16:29,297
For the first time in my life
I don't want to work either.

1427
01:16:30,095 --> 01:16:31,665
It must be the climate. Enervating.

1428
01:16:31,907 --> 01:16:33,000
Climate, my eye.

1429
01:16:33,353 --> 01:16:37,160
If you ask me, you carry a torch so
big they could use you for a lighthouse.

1430
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,004
That's my nose you're looking at.

1431
01:16:39,785 --> 01:16:44,084
Listen, when a man like you goes on a
four-star bender and then can't unbend.

1432
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,306
The reason usually wears a skirt.

1433
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:47,936
Oh sure.

1434
01:16:48,219 --> 01:16:51,263
Probably some right
little tight little bluenose.

1435
01:16:54,728 --> 01:16:56,231
What do you say we get out of here?

1436
01:16:57,386 --> 01:16:58,141
Why not?

1437
01:16:58,752 --> 01:17:01,092
I'll take a whack at
blowing out that torch.

1438
01:17:33,435 --> 01:17:35,435
How did you like Manila?
- I'll let you know late.

1439
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:38,318
In here, Miss.

1440
01:17:42,095 --> 01:17:43,476
But that is Mr Davis's room.

1441
01:17:43,813 --> 01:17:46,001
What a coincidence.
I knew a Mr Davis once.

1442
01:17:59,329 --> 01:18:00,522
Isn't this charming?

1443
01:18:00,939 --> 01:18:02,583
Now we can have some honeymoon bridge.

1444
01:18:04,141 --> 01:18:04,828
Oh?

1445
01:18:05,108 --> 01:18:06,438
Isn't the honeymoon over yet?

1446
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:09,261
How long has he been
in never-never land?

1447
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:10,986
Ever since he hit that bed.

1448
01:18:12,329 --> 01:18:14,763
I got all dressed up to watch him sleep.

1449
01:18:17,972 --> 01:18:19,101
Well, he looks intact.

1450
01:18:19,512 --> 01:18:20,184
He is.

1451
01:18:23,775 --> 01:18:24,904
My name is Paula Lane.

1452
01:18:25,146 --> 01:18:26,247
I'm glad to know you.

1453
01:18:29,718 --> 01:18:32,080
Right back at you, sister.
I'm Crystal McRegan.

1454
01:18:32,998 --> 01:18:34,926
And I ought to have my head examined.

1455
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:37,524
I've wasted the best 8 hours of my life.

1456
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,632
Getting him into this
helpless condition.

1457
01:18:40,261 --> 01:18:42,082
He's useless to man or beast.

1458
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,620
I knew him once, so maybe
I can work out something.

1459
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:49,509
Funny.

1460
01:18:50,715 --> 01:18:52,697
You don't look the way
I figured you at all.

1461
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:54,810
You're no bluenose.

1462
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:57,318
Well, so long.

1463
01:18:57,872 --> 01:18:59,330
I know when I'm outpointed.

1464
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:05,679
But before I go just for the fun of it.

1465
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:08,818
Let's see how it would have
been if we'd cut for him.

1466
01:19:09,219 --> 01:19:11,109
Okay, high card gets the pot.

1467
01:19:12,176 --> 01:19:12,963
A rum pot.

1468
01:19:13,284 --> 01:19:14,270
No, not rum.

1469
01:19:14,627 --> 01:19:16,208
Champagne and Irish whiskey.

1470
01:19:16,467 --> 01:19:18,984
A sweet light drink without authority.

1471
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,229
He said.

1472
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:23,315
Go ahead.

1473
01:19:24,867 --> 01:19:25,625
The Jack.

1474
01:19:26,397 --> 01:19:27,155
The King.

1475
01:19:28,566 --> 01:19:29,742
Well, I feel better.

1476
01:19:30,219 --> 01:19:31,439
Now that it's legal.

1477
01:19:33,946 --> 01:19:35,979
And say, if it's any comfort to you.

1478
01:19:36,289 --> 01:19:37,743
I didn't get anywhere with him.

1479
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:40,111
Struck out with the bases loaded.

1480
01:19:51,429 --> 01:19:53,401
I told you I needed some sleep.

1481
01:20:01,519 --> 01:20:02,877
Did you call for room service?

1482
01:20:08,026 --> 01:20:10,015
You must be something that
came to me in a dream.

1483
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,285
I am particular for what kind
of dreams I find myself in.

1484
01:20:18,575 --> 01:20:19,476
Where is Kirk?

1485
01:20:21,402 --> 01:20:22,760
He's coming on the next plane.

1486
01:20:23,411 --> 01:20:26,375
How about measuring you for a nice,
big, sizzling seltzer pick-me-up?

1487
01:20:27,017 --> 01:20:29,472
No, no. I couldn't stand the noise.

1488
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:32,859
Then we'll do the next best thing.
Take off your clothes.

1489
01:20:35,249 --> 01:20:36,464
And get under the shower.

1490
01:20:37,446 --> 01:20:39,171
I would rather go on with that dream.

1491
01:20:42,702 --> 01:20:44,003
And I'd rather you wouldn't.

1492
01:20:51,016 --> 01:20:52,733
Now, how about that shower?

1493
01:20:53,317 --> 01:20:54,761
Or are you afraid of getting wet?

1494
01:20:57,099 --> 01:20:58,630
How are you and Kirk hitting it off?

1495
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:59,917
On all twelve cylinders.

1496
01:21:00,317 --> 01:21:02,680
Now go and get yourself all dry
and then you can take me out ..

1497
01:21:02,977 --> 01:21:04,106
And get all wet again.

1498
01:21:04,451 --> 01:21:05,346
Take who out?

1499
01:21:06,648 --> 01:21:07,576
Take me out.

1500
01:21:12,038 --> 01:21:13,282
I'm sorry. I'm flat broke.

1501
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:16,989
Oh, no you're not. I've got that salary
you forgot to pick up in Hanoi.

1502
01:21:17,259 --> 01:21:18,581
Put it on the mantelpiece.

1503
01:21:29,786 --> 01:21:30,701
You do ..

1504
01:21:31,396 --> 01:21:32,468
Want to take me out?

1505
01:21:32,992 --> 01:21:33,790
Don't you?

1506
01:21:35,462 --> 01:21:37,208
Oh sure. Sure.

1507
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,352
How did you track me down anyway?

1508
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,820
Stafford's bloodhounds found you.

1509
01:21:57,501 --> 01:21:59,766
He cabled Kirk he wasn't
sore about that Kirsten story.

1510
01:22:00,565 --> 01:22:01,609
That's nice of him.

1511
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:03,760
Isn't it.

1512
01:22:04,959 --> 01:22:06,727
He asked Kirk to get
you back on the job.

1513
01:22:07,513 --> 01:22:09,051
He said to leave no stone unturned.

1514
01:22:11,307 --> 01:22:14,593
You can tell Papa you did fine with
all stones until you met Gibraltar.

1515
01:22:15,081 --> 01:22:15,867
That's me.

1516
01:22:16,851 --> 01:22:18,976
That's not why I'm
here in Manila, Jonny.

1517
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:21,982
I don't care whether you
go back to work of not.

1518
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:29,403
Honey, what are you trying to do,
work your way through college?

1519
01:22:29,926 --> 01:22:30,655
Kind of.

1520
01:22:31,371 --> 01:22:33,865
I just want to get you back on
your feet for the last round.

1521
01:22:34,564 --> 01:22:35,922
I want you in there, punching.

1522
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:37,762
At what?

1523
01:22:39,305 --> 01:22:40,423
I don't like set-ups.

1524
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:43,492
Don't you remember?
We've got a celebration coming to us.

1525
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:46,770
One we've postponed a couple of times.

1526
01:23:12,351 --> 01:23:14,253
I'm glad to hear you and
Kirk are doing alright.

1527
01:23:15,539 --> 01:23:16,224
Uhuh.

1528
01:23:23,153 --> 01:23:24,235
Yeah, that's fine.

1529
01:23:24,636 --> 01:23:25,913
What recipe did he use?

1530
01:23:26,571 --> 01:23:28,444
Not fair asking a cake how it's made.

1531
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:35,548
Some cakes should be thoroughly beaten.

1532
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,772
I am so glad.
- For what?

1533
01:23:45,171 --> 01:23:46,120
We stopped.

1534
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,428
It is time to go back
to the hotel isn't it?

1535
01:23:48,528 --> 01:23:50,191
What hotel?
- Your hotel.

1536
01:23:52,124 --> 01:23:53,540
I took a room right next to you.

1537
01:23:54,002 --> 01:23:55,245
Nice of me, huh?

1538
01:23:55,561 --> 01:23:56,847
No. Optimistic.

1539
01:24:01,673 --> 01:24:02,485
Goodnight.

1540
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:03,737
Goodnight.

1541
01:24:04,194 --> 01:24:04,880
Yes?

1542
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:07,929
I'm afraid you are the one
who is being optimistic.

1543
01:24:31,398 --> 01:24:32,995
Why don't you try some oil, Jonny?

1544
01:24:33,742 --> 01:24:35,150
Isn't that your speciality?

1545
01:24:36,352 --> 01:24:37,433
What's yours?

1546
01:24:38,314 --> 01:24:39,715
I know a good way to find out.

1547
01:24:41,253 --> 01:24:42,921
We must be thinking of the same one.

1548
01:24:44,636 --> 01:24:45,435
I wonder.

1549
01:24:46,233 --> 01:24:47,875
What I had in mind was you crawling.

1550
01:24:50,308 --> 01:24:51,695
Around the edge of the balcony.

1551
01:24:53,538 --> 01:24:55,813
Well, I was thinking of something
a little less athletic.

1552
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:57,369
But just as daring.

1553
01:24:58,829 --> 01:25:00,580
Of course, if you are
afraid of falling ..

1554
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,203
Don't worry.

1555
01:25:04,341 --> 01:25:05,975
I always land on my feet.

1556
01:25:07,749 --> 01:25:10,529
The first time I've had my hands on
bamboo since I gave up Mah-jong.

1557
01:25:10,867 --> 01:25:12,317
Really? What make it swell?

1558
01:25:13,402 --> 01:25:14,961
I got splinters under my fingernails.

1559
01:25:15,472 --> 01:25:17,594
You should wear gloves
when you play games.

1560
01:25:17,989 --> 01:25:18,782
I do.

1561
01:25:19,172 --> 01:25:21,274
And I know when to take them off.
And that's right now.

1562
01:25:22,045 --> 01:25:23,346
What goes with you and Kirk?

1563
01:25:24,122 --> 01:25:25,008
Same as ever.

1564
01:25:25,224 --> 01:25:28,129
He's the type of man that signs a
love letter "respectfully yours".

1565
01:25:29,011 --> 01:25:30,992
I didn't know he wrote them.
- He talks them.

1566
01:25:32,197 --> 01:25:33,215
He talks too much.

1567
01:25:34,023 --> 01:25:35,466
He doesn't even know how to kiss.

1568
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,998
I suppose he is learning now?

1569
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,469
Well. He practices enough.

1570
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:43,333
Let me show you what happens.

1571
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:45,298
You point at your mouth.

1572
01:25:46,505 --> 01:25:47,863
And then you aim at your ears.

1573
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:51,962
Of course, it is kind of nice in a way.

1574
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,445
Something like a puppy.

1575
01:25:54,665 --> 01:25:56,166
How would you want him to kiss you?

1576
01:25:57,473 --> 01:25:58,341
Like this.

1577
01:26:01,595 --> 01:26:02,346
Or this.

1578
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,390
So the kid kisses like a puppy, huh?

1579
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,886
Just be patient with him.
He'll be a full-grown dog.

1580
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,609
It runs in the family.

1581
01:26:14,485 --> 01:26:15,623
I thought you would.

1582
01:26:15,855 --> 01:26:17,814
I thought I could make you
cross your own brother.

1583
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,584
He's worth ten of you, a hundred of you.

1584
01:26:19,705 --> 01:26:21,001
How many?
- Two hundred.

1585
01:26:21,902 --> 01:26:24,023
You certainly look very
funny standing there.

1586
01:26:24,259 --> 01:26:25,160
Oh, funny huh?

1587
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,135
Very funny.

1588
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:27,614
But I can laugh ..

1589
01:26:27,714 --> 01:26:30,728
Because now I'm the one who can turn
around and walk away and not look back.

1590
01:26:31,405 --> 01:26:32,420
So long, Mr Davis.

1591
01:26:32,663 --> 01:26:34,113
Now I don't owe you a thing.

1592
01:27:10,683 --> 01:27:11,496
Paula.

1593
01:27:12,848 --> 01:27:13,634
No lights.

1594
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:15,913
I don't trust you even with
them on, Jonny Davis.

1595
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:19,991
Wrong Davis.

1596
01:27:20,632 --> 01:27:21,665
Kirk.
- Yeah.

1597
01:27:21,919 --> 01:27:23,100
And I said no lights.

1598
01:27:23,624 --> 01:27:24,810
I'm giving you a break.

1599
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:27,123
You probably got cold cream
smeared over your puss anyway.

1600
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:28,495
I don't get this at all.

1601
01:27:28,596 --> 01:27:30,984
Sorry to barge in. They let me
in Jonny's room. He wasn't in ..

1602
01:27:31,084 --> 01:27:32,997
You expect to find him here?
- Take it easy.

1603
01:27:34,555 --> 01:27:35,341
Hear that?

1604
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,762
Sure. That's just the army.
They always fly around.

1605
01:27:37,862 --> 01:27:39,758
Yeah. Only this time
it is the wrong army.

1606
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:42,409
Those plans have got the Rising
Sun painted all over their wings.

1607
01:27:43,176 --> 01:27:44,162
Read it and weep.

1608
01:27:44,294 --> 01:27:46,454
I was at The Chronicle office
downtown when this came in.

1609
01:27:46,782 --> 01:27:48,435
Japan just bombed Pearl Harbor.

1610
01:27:55,031 --> 01:27:56,757
[ Air-raid siren ]

1611
01:28:00,804 --> 01:28:02,322
[ Air-raid siren ]

1612
01:28:03,857 --> 01:28:05,829
Any more dope on Hawaii?
- None so far.

1613
01:28:05,929 --> 01:28:06,909
All I know is ..

1614
01:28:07,009 --> 01:28:09,798
Some of those little dickie-birds flew
in at breakfast time and laid some eggs.

1615
01:28:10,402 --> 01:28:12,381
Manila can expect some
of the same any minute.

1616
01:28:12,828 --> 01:28:15,579
Have you cabled The Chronicle?
- No. Censorship slapped on it.

1617
01:28:15,993 --> 01:28:17,726
I don't know how long
it is going to last.

1618
01:28:18,446 --> 01:28:20,953
I guess I won't have to alibi to
Stafford now for not finding Jonny.

1619
01:28:21,944 --> 01:28:23,589
I found him. But not for long.

1620
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:25,104
Know where he went?
- No.

1621
01:28:25,672 --> 01:28:27,794
At the moment, I didn't care
as long as it was away.

1622
01:28:29,348 --> 01:28:30,563
You're a bad liar, honey.

1623
01:28:31,157 --> 01:28:32,887
You're still stuck on
him as much as ever.

1624
01:28:34,932 --> 01:28:35,596
More.

1625
01:28:36,807 --> 01:28:38,644
But I hate the sight of him too.

1626
01:28:39,286 --> 01:28:40,072
And Jonny?

1627
01:28:40,507 --> 01:28:41,408
How about him?

1628
01:28:42,882 --> 01:28:45,890
Oh, I don't know. Does anybody
ever really know about Jonny?

1629
01:28:46,926 --> 01:28:49,247
I'm for you and you're for
Jonny and he's for himself.

1630
01:28:49,639 --> 01:28:50,997
A nice design for going crazy.

1631
01:28:51,536 --> 01:28:52,784
Yeah, the mystic maze.

1632
01:28:53,066 --> 01:28:54,542
Six ways in and no way out.

1633
01:28:59,787 --> 01:29:00,716
[ Door knocks ]

1634
01:29:07,902 --> 01:29:10,004
Come in out of the night air,
Junior. It's bad for you.

1635
01:29:10,109 --> 01:29:12,120
Hello, Jonny.
- Give me a hand with this, will you.

1636
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:15,402
You got the wrong room, Mr Davis.

1637
01:29:15,996 --> 01:29:16,931
How was Hanoi?

1638
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,335
Fine. How are you?

1639
01:29:18,512 --> 01:29:19,670
Up to my neck in a war.

1640
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,273
Where's your bags?
- In your room.

1641
01:29:21,373 --> 01:29:23,293
What are you doing?
- Packed?        - Yes.

1642
01:29:23,495 --> 01:29:25,968
Good, Leave them that way. You go
to Australia with towhead here.

1643
01:29:26,368 --> 01:29:27,687
The boat leaves in an hour.

1644
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:29,431
Listen, if I go to Australia ..

1645
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,994
It will be because I can't stay away
from kangaroos another minute.

1646
01:29:32,529 --> 01:29:34,231
Right now, I can take
them or leave them.

1647
01:29:34,331 --> 01:29:36,465
You'll take them. Here is
what you'll wear on the boat.

1648
01:29:37,779 --> 01:29:40,057
I'm up to my neck in the war
too. I'm not running out on it.

1649
01:29:40,157 --> 01:29:42,210
You're not running out.
The Chronicle is pushing you.

1650
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,285
Here's Stafford's cable.
- Who'll cover Manila?

1651
01:29:44,385 --> 01:29:47,491
I'll cover it like a dirty shirt.
- It took a war to get you back to work?

1652
01:29:47,892 --> 01:29:49,339
This beanie goes with that dress.

1653
01:29:49,939 --> 01:29:52,242
I wouldn't wear these together
if I were going anywhere.

1654
01:29:52,629 --> 01:29:53,651
Which I am not.

1655
01:29:56,939 --> 01:29:58,212
This will go with anything.

1656
01:29:58,366 --> 01:30:00,812
Before we don't leave I'd like to
tell you something about Paula.

1657
01:30:01,016 --> 01:30:02,575
I've heard it. Words and music.

1658
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:05,204
I need to pack her,
if I do say so myself.

1659
01:30:06,246 --> 01:30:08,520
Listen Jonny Davis, you're not
going to get me out of Manila.

1660
01:30:08,855 --> 01:30:11,217
Not me, it's The Chronicle.
Orders, get it? Orders.

1661
01:30:11,653 --> 01:30:13,476
That goes for you too, Junior.
- I quit.

1662
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:15,243
Nobody quits. Get your bags.

1663
01:30:16,054 --> 01:30:17,126
Okay, I'll get them.

1664
01:30:17,314 --> 01:30:19,159
You get dressed or I'll
dress you in the taxi.

1665
01:30:22,187 --> 01:30:25,362
Say, who does he think he is?
- He reminds me a little of Jonny Davis.

1666
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:28,038
Pushing us around. Are you
going to let him get away with it?

1667
01:30:28,409 --> 01:30:29,861
I'm going to let him think he is.

1668
01:30:30,193 --> 01:30:31,351
Never argue with Jonny.

1669
01:30:31,568 --> 01:30:33,642
Just listen to him while
he plays Mister Big.

1670
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:35,806
And even let him believe
that you agree with him.

1671
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:36,728
And.

1672
01:30:37,272 --> 01:30:38,545
Figure it out for yourself.

1673
01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:42,418
I think you got something there, Junior.

1674
01:30:50,046 --> 01:30:52,177
Well, how do you think I'll
look in a Red Cross uniform?

1675
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,744
They guys aren't going to
mind getting shot to find out.

1676
01:30:54,894 --> 01:30:56,081
One of them might be me.

1677
01:30:56,763 --> 01:30:58,058
I'm going to join the army.

1678
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:02,984
I hope Manila is still
there when we get back.

1679
01:31:03,147 --> 01:31:05,049
We'll be standing on that
wharf in half an hour.

1680
01:31:05,447 --> 01:31:07,844
I hope the trip back in the Pilot Boat
won't be too rough on you.

1681
01:31:08,527 --> 01:31:10,586
Not nearly as rough as
fighting it out with Jonny.

1682
01:32:00,661 --> 01:32:01,331
Well.

1683
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:02,975
Here you are. Sun Valley.

1684
01:32:03,201 --> 01:32:05,478
Thanks Slim. I'll send right
home and get my skis.

1685
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:08,704
Don't forget to strain the tadpoles out
of that water before you drink it.

1686
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,141
Me drink water?

1687
01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:12,595
That stuff ain't even fit
to wash my feet in.

1688
01:32:23,672 --> 01:32:24,835
Snap into it, Bill.

1689
01:32:27,802 --> 01:32:28,989
Looks like a direct hit.

1690
01:32:29,854 --> 01:32:31,581
Yeah, Right on the ridge.

1691
01:32:32,275 --> 01:32:33,880
Must have aimed at the cross.

1692
01:32:34,377 --> 01:32:35,851
Field Hospital Number 3, huh?

1693
01:32:36,104 --> 01:32:36,811
It was.

1694
01:32:37,776 --> 01:32:39,020
How many got out?
- None.

1695
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:41,034
Tie that wire off over there.

1696
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:44,397
A nice little human interest
story for the folks back home.

1697
01:32:44,579 --> 01:32:46,413
Make sure they get it.
What paper you with?

1698
01:32:46,513 --> 01:32:47,605
New York Chronicle.

1699
01:32:47,705 --> 01:32:50,081
I've heard of it. This is that
war it said we couldn't have.

1700
01:32:50,287 --> 01:32:51,880
Oh well, things are different now.

1701
01:32:52,227 --> 01:32:54,860
Pearl Harbor jumped Stafford and The
Chronicle right on the bandwagon.

1702
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:57,897
Of course I don't know what will happen
when the wagon hits the first bumps.

1703
01:33:00,983 --> 01:33:01,855
All set, sir.

1704
01:33:02,222 --> 01:33:03,808
Then get going, boys. Good luck.

1705
01:33:04,326 --> 01:33:05,484
Got it right here, sir.

1706
01:33:05,865 --> 01:33:06,623
Let's go.

1707
01:33:11,284 --> 01:33:12,042
Where to?

1708
01:33:12,392 --> 01:33:14,469
They'll tell you when they get back.
- From where?

1709
01:33:22,195 --> 01:33:22,858
Hey.

1710
01:33:23,543 --> 01:33:25,584
How about riding with you fellahs?
- No riders.

1711
01:33:25,858 --> 01:33:27,731
Don't tell me you want
us to carry you too?

1712
01:33:28,008 --> 01:33:29,736
Why, on the contrary. Here, allow me.

1713
01:33:30,252 --> 01:33:32,500
You bet. You bet we'll allow you.

1714
01:33:43,343 --> 01:33:45,457
That's dynamite. Don't stub your toe.

1715
01:33:47,612 --> 01:33:49,457
What makes you think
I didn't stub it already?

1716
01:33:57,764 --> 01:33:59,751
The army sure travels on its stomach.

1717
01:34:17,232 --> 01:34:19,392
Good work, Porto.
- Thank you, sir.

1718
01:34:21,326 --> 01:34:22,455
Give him a hand, boys.

1719
01:34:25,095 --> 01:34:26,437
Not a minute too soon.

1720
01:34:32,278 --> 01:34:34,066
My name is Davis, Lieutenant.
Correspondent.

1721
01:34:34,236 --> 01:34:36,086
I hitch-hiked a ride with the boys.
- Oh.

1722
01:34:42,198 --> 01:34:43,607
Quite a landing party.

1723
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:45,743
A correspondent, eh?

1724
01:34:46,221 --> 01:34:47,064
That's fine.

1725
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,638
We can duck your words.
Can you duck our bullets?

1726
01:34:50,888 --> 01:34:51,775
I can try.

1727
01:34:54,185 --> 01:34:55,013
Davis, huh?

1728
01:34:55,999 --> 01:34:57,670
Ain't one Davis around here enough?

1729
01:35:10,993 --> 01:35:13,324
Dish out the dynamite, Freddy.
Get the men busy on the cookies.

1730
01:35:13,655 --> 01:35:16,253
Yeah, we sure want the right
refreshments for our party.

1731
01:35:16,838 --> 01:35:18,514
We don't want the boys to go hungry.

1732
01:35:27,298 --> 01:35:28,857
You're a dead ringer for my brother.

1733
01:35:29,476 --> 01:35:30,663
Only he is in Australia.

1734
01:35:31,195 --> 01:35:32,256
How do you know?

1735
01:35:33,447 --> 01:35:34,786
I put him on a boat.

1736
01:35:35,002 --> 01:35:36,908
You should have stuck around.
He got off.

1737
01:35:37,668 --> 01:35:39,026
Anybody else get off with him?

1738
01:35:39,481 --> 01:35:41,183
Yeah. An unidentified blond.

1739
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:43,278
Where is she?
- Back there.

1740
01:35:43,645 --> 01:35:44,460
Back where?

1741
01:35:44,997 --> 01:35:46,394
A place called Sun Valley.

1742
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:49,114
Oh yeah. I know. I was there.

1743
01:35:50,049 --> 01:35:51,064
What is she doing?

1744
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:53,356
Probably holding
some lucky stiff's hand.

1745
01:35:53,938 --> 01:35:55,219
She joined the Red Cross.

1746
01:35:56,558 --> 01:35:57,807
Field Hospital Number 3?

1747
01:35:57,990 --> 01:36:00,476
That's right. Field Hospital Number 3.
How come you didn't see her?

1748
01:36:03,647 --> 01:36:04,644
I don't know.

1749
01:36:05,104 --> 01:36:05,947
I guess I ..

1750
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:07,771
Just missed her.

1751
01:36:08,634 --> 01:36:10,219
You missed me a couple of times too.

1752
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:13,324
The "forever" set-up. That will get her.
That's what you said.

1753
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,529
Why hold that against me?

1754
01:36:17,008 --> 01:36:19,145
I handed you a golden
blond on a silver platter.

1755
01:36:19,468 --> 01:36:21,482
Don't you know you can't
give people to each other?

1756
01:36:21,582 --> 01:36:23,284
You can't move them
around like checkers.

1757
01:36:23,666 --> 01:36:25,224
I never got within ten yards of her.

1758
01:36:25,324 --> 01:36:26,777
Alright. Let's park it.

1759
01:36:27,741 --> 01:36:29,082
Some things you can't park.

1760
01:36:29,684 --> 01:36:30,899
Take Paula, for instance.

1761
01:36:31,586 --> 01:36:33,937
The thing for you to do is to take
what you can while you can.

1762
01:36:34,037 --> 01:36:35,411
Alright. I said let's park it.

1763
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,306
For the duration.

1764
01:36:38,065 --> 01:36:41,340
Alright, come on, come on.
Help yourselves. Keep them going.

1765
01:36:41,887 --> 01:36:42,873
Keep making them.

1766
01:36:43,211 --> 01:36:44,598
Alright, make with the cookies.

1767
01:36:45,427 --> 01:36:46,816
You too, golden words.

1768
01:36:50,674 --> 01:36:52,060
Ever see these things before?

1769
01:36:52,298 --> 01:36:53,934
Yes, sure. Casey's cookies.

1770
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,969
I gave them a column last week.

1771
01:36:57,049 --> 01:36:58,460
Two parts hollow bamboo.

1772
01:36:58,843 --> 01:37:00,073
One part dynamite.

1773
01:37:00,955 --> 01:37:02,570
Garnished with a percussion cap.

1774
01:37:02,852 --> 01:37:05,465
Drop among buttered Japs
and it mixes them thoroughly.

1775
01:37:05,763 --> 01:37:08,054
The dirty little sons of .. heaven.

1776
01:37:28,363 --> 01:37:29,363
Alright, men.

1777
01:37:41,066 --> 01:37:42,339
We can take our pick, boys.

1778
01:37:42,653 --> 01:37:44,784
We can shoot the enemy out
of the water before he lands.

1779
01:37:44,899 --> 01:37:48,555
Or let him land, try to wipe him out and
capture that beautiful equipment he has.

1780
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:49,622
Let him land.

1781
01:37:49,722 --> 01:37:51,455
Sure. I hear they carry chocolate bars.

1782
01:37:51,709 --> 01:37:53,093
It is hardly necessary to add.

1783
01:37:53,418 --> 01:37:55,034
We are outnumbered.
- Ain't we always?

1784
01:37:55,249 --> 01:37:56,681
It is getting positively boring.

1785
01:37:56,897 --> 01:37:58,271
We'll make them yell uncle.

1786
01:37:58,371 --> 01:38:01,385
Here is the way I see it.
I want two men, carrying cookies.

1787
01:38:01,803 --> 01:38:05,354
To climb down the cliff and blast the
Japs as they concentrate on the beach.

1788
01:38:06,291 --> 01:38:07,935
They'll make for that canyon down there.

1789
01:38:08,357 --> 01:38:10,254
It is the only way to get
to or from the beach.

1790
01:38:11,098 --> 01:38:12,170
They'll make for it.

1791
01:38:12,347 --> 01:38:13,562
But they won't get there.

1792
01:38:13,759 --> 01:38:16,435
Because the rest of us will be at the
mouth of the canyon waiting for them.

1793
01:38:16,535 --> 01:38:17,855
Who has to toss the cookies?

1794
01:38:17,955 --> 01:38:19,862
Not you Purdy. I've seen you pitch.

1795
01:38:22,025 --> 01:38:23,147
You Porto for one.

1796
01:38:23,419 --> 01:38:24,270
Yes, sir.

1797
01:38:24,688 --> 01:38:25,957
How about me, Lieutenant?

1798
01:38:26,057 --> 01:38:27,900
I used to throw a javelin
for Brooklyn High.

1799
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,156
Alright. You, Davis.

1800
01:38:29,344 --> 01:38:30,102
Yes, sir.

1801
01:38:30,452 --> 01:38:32,268
The rest of you will
follow me to the canyon.

1802
01:38:32,683 --> 01:38:34,442
With the exception
of the visiting fireman.

1803
01:38:34,965 --> 01:38:36,889
And you Purdy, who
will stay in the foxhole.

1804
01:38:37,341 --> 01:38:39,003
Why me? Ain't this a democracy?

1805
01:38:39,322 --> 01:38:39,994
It is.

1806
01:38:40,223 --> 01:38:43,035
You and your machine gun are going to
shield the 2 democrats with the cookies.

1807
01:38:43,268 --> 01:38:45,056
Well, Mama and me
will be in there spitting.

1808
01:39:00,983 --> 01:39:02,043
Fix bayonets.

1809
01:39:07,597 --> 01:39:09,099
Porto. Davis.

1810
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:11,097
Wait five minutes and then start.

1811
01:39:13,334 --> 01:39:13,977
7:53?

1812
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:14,986
Right.

1813
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:18,254
Just in case you boys need
something to get you in the mood.

1814
01:39:18,526 --> 01:39:19,799
Sam brought some news back.

1815
01:39:20,451 --> 01:39:23,123
The Nippos bombed Field
Hospital Number 3 last night.

1816
01:39:23,912 --> 01:39:25,144
All hands lost.

1817
01:39:33,294 --> 01:39:34,411
Come on, democrats.

1818
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:37,071
And don't forget to
spell our names right.

1819
01:39:39,341 --> 01:39:40,127
Follow me.

1820
01:39:41,697 --> 01:39:43,467
Did you know about Number 3, Jonny?

1821
01:39:43,735 --> 01:39:44,721
Sure. I heard it.

1822
01:39:46,129 --> 01:39:47,430
I let her get off that boat.

1823
01:39:47,876 --> 01:39:49,292
I even put the idea in her head.

1824
01:39:50,298 --> 01:39:51,056
My fault.

1825
01:39:52,678 --> 01:39:54,122
Why didn't you tell me, Jonny?

1826
01:39:56,049 --> 01:39:59,346
I don't put anything in the paper until
I hear it twice and see it three times.

1827
01:40:00,439 --> 01:40:01,606
Here we go, pal.

1828
01:40:03,002 --> 01:40:03,927
Alright, Sam.

1829
01:40:05,655 --> 01:40:07,757
You didn't tell me because
you wanted to give me break.

1830
01:40:09,768 --> 01:40:11,407
I just don't believe it. That's all.

1831
01:40:14,627 --> 01:40:17,015
I can take it, Jonny.
Just like anybody else.

1832
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,872
I guess people can take
a lot when they have to.

1833
01:40:21,689 --> 01:40:22,876
You said something once.

1834
01:40:23,642 --> 01:40:25,118
It makes a lot of sense to me now.

1835
01:40:26,318 --> 01:40:28,691
You said history wouldn't let a
man stay in bed with his hat on.

1836
01:40:30,318 --> 01:40:31,247
You were right.

1837
01:40:31,783 --> 01:40:32,912
See you later, Senior.

1838
01:40:36,042 --> 01:40:38,249
Don't let Mr Moto think
too fast out there, kid.

1839
01:41:12,397 --> 01:41:14,299
Those kids are sure getting
dry behind the ears.

1840
01:41:14,886 --> 01:41:16,718
It must be this tropical sun.
- Yeah.

1841
01:41:23,848 --> 01:41:25,950
You'll get a better look from
down there, golden words.

1842
01:41:27,754 --> 01:41:29,439
Take good care of Mama.
- Uhuh.

1843
01:41:33,943 --> 01:41:35,244
There goes the first cookie.

1844
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:44,394
The last thing they said to me was
don't forget to spell the names right.

1845
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:46,912
I got them straight and I want
you to get them straight too.

1846
01:41:47,012 --> 01:41:48,800
Because here is some
of the things they did.

1847
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:50,004
Take Sam Porto.

1848
01:41:50,361 --> 01:41:51,719
Sam was a dentist from Manila.

1849
01:41:51,957 --> 01:41:53,527
Painless to everybody but the Japs.

1850
01:41:54,909 --> 01:41:57,334
He was a little guy with a great
big grin and a heart to match.

1851
01:41:58,415 --> 01:42:01,681
A party of Nippos were taking cover in
a cave 100 feet below him on the beach.

1852
01:42:02,089 --> 01:42:05,060
The only way Sam could get at them was
to blow the ground from under himself.

1853
01:42:05,626 --> 01:42:08,502
He must have known as he threw that last
dynamite stick that he was going to die.

1854
01:42:08,742 --> 01:42:10,072
But he threw it all the same.

1855
01:42:14,127 --> 01:42:16,079
That was Sam Porto and
don't forget the name.

1856
01:42:19,011 --> 01:42:20,918
Take Kirk Davis, ex-war correspondent.

1857
01:42:21,106 --> 01:42:24,621
He was halfway down a cliff stood on a
ledge not wide enough for his number 9s.

1858
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:27,595
He made a target that would
gladden the heart of a Jap gunner ..

1859
01:42:27,695 --> 01:42:30,501
But he was in a position to do plenty
of damage if they didn't see him first.

1860
01:42:30,704 --> 01:42:32,702
The Japs were setting up
house in another cave ..

1861
01:42:32,802 --> 01:42:34,947
Where they could rake the
beach with machine gun fire.

1862
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,566
Lieutenant Halls led his
men out of the canyon.

1863
01:42:41,013 --> 01:42:42,176
Don't forget the name.

1864
01:42:42,357 --> 01:42:44,545
Lieutenant Wade Halls West Point 1937.

1865
01:42:45,346 --> 01:42:49,179
By now the Japs had got the ticker going
and a Filipino scout, Manuel Ortega ..

1866
01:42:49,604 --> 01:42:52,052
Don't forget that name,
copped a full burst.

1867
01:42:58,934 --> 01:43:00,661
Soldier Davis couldn't reach that gun.

1868
01:43:00,947 --> 01:43:03,123
But he could reach that big
rock balanced above it.

1869
01:43:11,325 --> 01:43:13,225
He did Brooklyn High
proud with that throw.

1870
01:43:13,442 --> 01:43:15,722
As a javelin thrower he stepped
right into the limelight.

1871
01:43:16,086 --> 01:43:18,607
But the limelight doesn't pay off
when the other guy has got a gun.

1872
01:43:19,703 --> 01:43:21,295
A Jap plane came out of nowhere.

1873
01:43:25,756 --> 01:43:29,110
And turned soldier Davis into a gold
star on his High School service flag.

1874
01:43:29,911 --> 01:43:32,027
That was Kirk Davis.
Don't forget the name.

1875
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:36,531
Don't forget Sergeant Tom Purdy who used
to bend a gas hose in Butte Montana.

1876
01:43:37,539 --> 01:43:41,363
That same Jap plane dived on the foxhole
and shot the legs out from under Mama.

1877
01:43:47,224 --> 01:43:49,068
"Mama" was what he
called his machine gun.

1878
01:43:49,267 --> 01:43:52,511
I almost feel the Montana democrat would
rather have stopped the bullets himself.

1879
01:43:53,052 --> 01:43:54,821
He was as sore as a boiled owl.

1880
01:43:57,307 --> 01:43:59,687
Lieutenant Halls was coming on
again but so was the Jap plane.

1881
01:44:01,701 --> 01:44:04,403
Halls got one through the leg
and he hit the sand face down.

1882
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:08,290
Sergeant Purdy picked up his busted Mama
and mounted it against his own body.

1883
01:44:08,478 --> 01:44:10,487
Kicking like forty mules straight away.

1884
01:44:19,737 --> 01:44:22,707
That Jap flyer went hunting his
ancestors in the Bataan jungle.

1885
01:44:22,988 --> 01:44:24,804
But there wasn't much
left of Sergeant Purdy.

1886
01:44:25,219 --> 01:44:27,998
He only lived long enough to know
that he and Mama had done their job.

1887
01:44:28,585 --> 01:44:31,101
Sergeant Tom Purdy.
Don't forget the name.

1888
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:35,924
Halls still had one good leg and a
dozen hard guys alongside him.

1889
01:44:36,242 --> 01:44:37,629
He couldn't walk. He could hop.

1890
01:44:37,737 --> 01:44:39,296
But he couldn't talk. He could point.

1891
01:44:41,589 --> 01:44:44,127
Thanks to Porto and Davis
the Japs were out in the open.

1892
01:44:46,267 --> 01:44:49,984
Thanks to Tom Purdy, all they had to
worry about now was being outnumbered.

1893
01:44:58,605 --> 01:45:00,834
Those hard guys charged and
that little scuffle was over.

1894
01:45:01,218 --> 01:45:03,137
Not so fast, Mr Davis.
- I'm sorry, kid.

1895
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:17,289
The little scuffle was
over and it was won.

1896
01:45:17,389 --> 01:45:19,434
And it wasn't just a win.
It proved something bigger.

1897
01:45:21,661 --> 01:45:23,396
I'll catch up with
you later, Lieutenant.

1898
01:45:29,689 --> 01:45:31,868
Brown men and white men
fought and died together.

1899
01:45:32,381 --> 01:45:34,369
When they bled, their
blood was the same color.

1900
01:45:34,469 --> 01:45:35,742
And don't forget the names.

1901
01:45:38,186 --> 01:45:40,332
Lieutenant Wade Halls,
Sergeant Tom Purdy.

1902
01:45:41,451 --> 01:45:44,267
Privates Manuel Ortega,
Sam Porto and Kirk Davis.

1903
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:45,869
They lost their lives.

1904
01:45:46,851 --> 01:45:49,163
No that's wrong. They didn't
lose them, they gave them up.

1905
01:45:49,404 --> 01:45:50,995
And I ask you not to forget the names.

1906
01:45:51,777 --> 01:45:52,553
Jonny.

1907
01:46:01,329 --> 01:46:02,784
I heard you just now, Jonny.

1908
01:46:03,225 --> 01:46:03,884
Kirk?

1909
01:46:03,984 --> 01:46:06,700
Stop snivelling, towhead.
You don't cry for heroes.

1910
01:46:11,539 --> 01:46:13,360
Say, where do you keep
your rabbit's foot?

1911
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:15,531
I heard everybody in
Hospital Number 3 got it.

1912
01:46:17,395 --> 01:46:18,496
On one of the breaks.

1913
01:46:19,062 --> 01:46:20,420
I was coming back with some ..

1914
01:46:20,663 --> 01:46:21,821
Food and clothes and ..

1915
01:46:22,888 --> 01:46:24,802
Is this all, Mr Davis?
Shall I mark it ready?

1916
01:46:24,902 --> 01:46:27,564
No. More to come. But you'd better
get moving with what you've got.

1917
01:46:27,664 --> 01:46:29,480
The radio can't last much longer.
- Yes, sir.

1918
01:46:29,939 --> 01:46:31,984
Put in a fresh sheet, honey.
We'll write it together.

1919
01:46:38,069 --> 01:46:39,799
We won that little fight
with the cookies.

1920
01:46:40,284 --> 01:46:43,206
Now, we won't be winning any more that
you hear about on the Bataan peninsula.

1921
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:45,282
The big push is on.

1922
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:48,373
They're throwing the book at us.
0rders have come to evacuate.

1923
01:46:48,545 --> 01:46:50,247
Tomorrow morning the
headlines will read:

1924
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:52,297
"<i>BATAAN FALLS!</i>"

1925
01:46:53,287 --> 01:46:54,827
The headlines will be wrong though.

1926
01:46:54,927 --> 01:46:58,171
Because Bataan has not fallen. It has
stood for 94 days and it still stands.

1927
01:47:00,067 --> 01:47:02,856
The best delaying action of the war was
fought in an area the size of a county.

1928
01:47:03,339 --> 01:47:05,817
300,000 Japanese were
tied in knots long enough.

1929
01:47:05,917 --> 01:47:08,077
For the USA to get its Sunday
clothes off and go to work.

1930
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:09,444
Hold it, Jonny.

1931
01:47:12,248 --> 01:47:12,937
Okay.

1932
01:47:13,037 --> 01:47:15,192
If a handful of Americans
and Filipinos can do all that.

1933
01:47:16,275 --> 01:47:19,676
Living off rice and mule-meat,
fighting with bricks, bats and bolas.

1934
01:47:19,999 --> 01:47:21,557
Then Bataan still stands.

1935
01:47:22,938 --> 01:47:25,656
The battle of Bataan was lost. By Japan.

1936
01:47:27,415 --> 01:47:29,187
In case the Japanese
don't realize that ..

1937
01:47:29,287 --> 01:47:31,830
I've a message for them from the
men dead and living, of Bataan.

1938
01:47:32,476 --> 01:47:33,395
More to come.

1939
01:47:34,362 --> 01:47:36,850
That is a newspaper term and it
means the story isn't finished.

1940
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:39,163
And the punch line has
not been written yet.

1941
01:47:40,099 --> 01:47:41,479
Remember that, Tokyo.

1942
01:47:41,931 --> 01:47:42,995
More to come.

1943
01:47:57,985 --> 01:47:58,692
(Ro-S)

1943
01:47:59,305 --> 01:48:59,340
