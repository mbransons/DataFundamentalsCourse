1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,001


2
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,416
<i>There have been
many tales</i>

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,335
<i>of the great warrior, Mulan.</i>

4
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,675
<i>But, ancestors,
this one is mine.</i>

5
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,386
<i>Here she is.</i>

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,013
<i>A young shoot, all green...</i>

7
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,058
<i>unaware of the blade.</i>

8
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,062
<i>If you had such a daughter...</i>

9
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,191
<i>her chi, the boundless energy
of life itself...</i>

10
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,986
<i>speaking through
her every motion...</i>

11
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>could you tell her that
only a son could wield chi?</i>

12
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:19,496
<i>That a daughter would risk
shame, dishonor, exile?</i>

13
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,502
<i>Ancestors, I could not.</i>

14
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,196
This way.

15
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,616
That's the last one.

16
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,783
Gently.

17
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,787
Mulan! Forget the chicken!

18
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:02,998
It will come back!

19
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,047
No!

20
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,678
Tell me your sister
is not the cause of this.

21
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,974
Mulan!

22
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,018
Take control of yourself!

23
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,214
Mulan!
Listen very carefully.

24
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,675
No!

25
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,211
Mulan, what happened
when you fell off the roof?

26
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,131
It was like you were a bird.

27
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,799
Don't panic.

28
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,093
There's a spider
crawling in your hair.

29
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,512
You know
I'm afraid of spiders.

30
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,265
This is not one of
your tricks, is it, Mulan?

31
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,852
Don't worry,
if you hold very still...

32
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,146
I will squash it.

33
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,857
It is because I'm trying
to protect Mulan

34
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,941
that I say this.

35
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,026
Mulan is young.

36
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,153
She is still learning
how to control herself.

37
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,864
You make excuses for her.

38
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,535
You forget, Mulan is
a daughter, not a son.

39
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,788
A daughter brings honor
through marriage.

40
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,334
Any man would be fortunate to
marry either of our daughters.

41
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,627
Including Mulan.

42
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,671
I ask you, what man will want
to marry a girl

43
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,882
who flits around rooftops,
chasing chickens?

44
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,347
Xiu gives me no trouble.

45
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,184
The matchmaker will find
a good husband for her.

46
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,395
It is Mulan I worry about.

47
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,732
They'll call her a witch.

48
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,195
It's time you talked to her.

49
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,430
Do you know why the phoenix

50
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,474
sits at the entrance
of our shrine?

51
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,522
She is the emissary
for our ancestors.

52
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,148
But I broke her.

53
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,946
Some say the phoenix
is consumed by flame...

54
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,198
and emerges again.

55
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,869
I think she can survive
a broken wing.

56
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,956
Your chi is strong, Mulan.

57
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,044
But chi is for warriors...

58
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,297
not daughters.

59
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,341
Soon, you'll be
a young woman...

60
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,386
and it is time for you...

61
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,556
to hide your gift away.

62
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,600
To...

63
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,145
To silence its voice.

64
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,441
I say this to protect you.

65
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,028
That is my job.

66
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,658
Your job is to bring honor
to the family.

67
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,037
Do you think you can do that?

68
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,272
Rourans? It can't be.

69
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,317
Close the gates!

70
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,622
Take out the leader!

71
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,044
He's way too strong!

72
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,595
You. You'll do.

73
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,123
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

74
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,126
six of our northern garrisons
along the Silk Road...

75
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,628
have fallen
in a coordinated attack.

76
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,173
All trade has been disrupted.

77
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,049
If we allow this to continue,

78
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,177
it could be
the end of the kingdom.

79
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,761
And my citizens?

80
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,556
Slaughtered.

81
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,518
This soldier
is the only survivor.

82
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,980
I fear
more attacks will follow.

83
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,316
Who is responsible?

84
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,863
Rourans, Your Majesty.

85
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,241
Their leader calls himself
Böri Khan.

86
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,868
I killed Böri Khan.

87
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,077
It is his son.

88
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,038
He has united the tribes

89
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,998
and resurrected
the Rouran army.

90
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,667
If I may,
Your Imperial Majesty.

91
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,381
You may speak.

92
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,929
Böri Khan
fights alongside a woman.

93
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,264
Her chi is beyond imagining.

94
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,767
There is no place
for witches in this kingdom.

95
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,645
It is forbidden
to use the power of chi

96
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,188
in destructive ways.

97
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,731
And yet, it is her skill

98
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,816
that leads the Rouran army
to victory.

99
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,778
She has trained an elite force
of shadow warriors

100
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,154
to assist Böri Khan.

101
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,449
We're not afraid
of dark magic.

102
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,953
We'll destroy this Rouran army
and their witch.

103
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,456
Here's my decree.

104
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,709
We'll build a mighty army.

105
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,796
Every family
will supply one man.

106
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:15,092
We'll protect
our beloved people...

107
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,469
{\an8}and crush these murderers.

108
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,974
<i>Deploy the Imperial Army.</i>

109
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,311
<i>The dynasty
will not be threatened.</i>

110
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,894
So, you have news.

111
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,813
The emperor sends his army

112
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,315
to defend the Silk Road.

113
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,399
Good.

114
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,984
We will crush every garrison

115
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,486
until the Imperial Army
is on its knees.

116
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,488
And then...

117
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,534
the Imperial City
will be laid bare.

118
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,621
The emperor
will be mine to kill.

119
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,248
You have proved useful, witch.

120
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,833
Not witch.

121
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,794
Warrior.

122
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,966
I could tear you to pieces
before you blink.

123
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,551
But you won't.

124
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,181
Remember what you want...

125
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:48,393
a place where your powers
will not be vilified.

126
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,605
A place where you are accepted
for who you are.

127
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,192
You won't get what you want
without me.

128
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,991
When I found you
on a desert steppe

129
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,576
wandering alone...

130
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,203
you were exiled.

131
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,163
A scorned dog.

132
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,585
When I sit on the throne,
that dog will have a home.

133
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,049
We will finish
what we started.

134
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,635
And you will see to it

135
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,972
that nothing and no one
stands in my way.

136
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,127
Black Wind and I
rode alongside

137
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,962
two rabbits
running side by side.

138
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,506
I think one was a male,
one was a female.

139
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,425
But you know,
you can't really tell

140
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,051
when they're running
that fast.

141
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,263
When I go riding tomorrow,
I will try to find them again.

142
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,514
Maybe they'll still be there.

143
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,516
We have excellent news.

144
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,269
The matchmaker has found you
an auspicious match.

145
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,024
Yes, Mulan, it is decided.

146
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,654
Come and sit down.

147
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,456
It is what is best
for our family.

148
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,759
Yes.

149
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:48,847
It is best.

150
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,893
I will bring honor to us all.

151
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,207
I'm truly blessed
to be in the presence

152
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,126
of such enchanting women.

153
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,629
I have no doubt today will be
a momentous day for the Hua...

154
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,507
Never mind that.
We must be on time.

155
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,050
I'm starving.

156
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,844
I already told you,
you cannot eat.

157
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,053
It will ruin your makeup.

158
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,182
The fiercest winter storm
could not destroy this makeup.

159
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,019
Xiu, look at my face.
What am I feeling?

160
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,812
I have no idea.

161
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,314
Exactly.

162
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:24,067
This is my sad face.
This is my curious face.

163
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,153
And now I'm confused.

164
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:30,949
Quiet.

165
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,119
Composed.

166
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:36,997
Graceful.

167
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,917
Elegant.

168
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,212
Poised.

169
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,589
Polite.

170
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,385
These are the qualities...

171
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,430
we see in a good wife.

172
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,267
These are the qualities...

173
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,146
we see in Mulan.

174
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,984
When a wife
serves her husband...

175
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,989
...she must be silent.

176
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,410
She must be...

177
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,329
invisible.

178
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,707
She must be...

179
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,544
Is something wrong?

180
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:27,464
No, Madam Matchmaker.
Thank you.

181
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,636
It's ideal for the teapot...

182
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:38,684
to remain
in the center of the table.

183
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,644
Yes, I understand.

184
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,816
But I think the teapot
should remain where it is.

185
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,026
Move the teapot.

186
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,236
Girl!

187
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,830
Dishonor to the Hua family.

188
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,460
They have failed
to raise a good daughter.

189
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,657
Citizens!

190
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:22,829
Citizens, we are under attack
from Northern Invaders.

191
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,542
Our land is at war.

192
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,503
By edict
of His Imperial Majesty,

193
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,129
the Son of Heaven...

194
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,926
every family must contribute
one man to fight.

195
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,388
One man from every house.

196
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,724
Wáng family.

197
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,688
Chin family.

198
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,233
Dù family.

199
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,403
Hua family.

200
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,538
I am Hua Zhou.

201
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,415
I served the Imperial Army

202
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,042
in the last battle
against the Northern Invaders.

203
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,421
Have you no son
old enough to fight?

204
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,842
I am blessed
with two daughters.

205
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,136
I will fight.

206
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,560
No.

207
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,353
You will
only humiliate him further.

208
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,022
Are you all right?
Can I help you?

209
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,106
No.

210
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,660
Liu family.

211
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,123
Wei family.

212
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,000
<i>You're a war hero.</i>

213
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,631
You've already made
many great sacrifices.

214
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,049
Are you suggesting...

215
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:03,472
our family not comply
with the Imperial edict?

216
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,098
But how can you fight...

217
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:10,103
I am the father.

218
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,189
It is my place to bring honor

219
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,149
to our family
on the battlefield.

220
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,943
You are the daughter!

221
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,072
Learn your place.

222
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,666
We must be strong.

223
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,460
This time, he will not return.

224
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,707
It's beautiful.

225
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,375
Beautiful tool...

226
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,253
for terrible work.

227
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,677
The phoenix.

228
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,474
You remember?

229
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,607
She has followed me
into battle before,

230
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,651
and she will follow me now.

231
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:29,701
And she will tell our
ancestors I've been loyal...

232
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,912
brave, and true.

233
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,416
I wish I was as brave as you.

234
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,544
There is no courage
without fear.

235
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:40,295
But, Father...

236
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,756
You must be courageous, Mulan.

237
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,050
For your mother

238
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,302
and your sister.

239
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,850
For me.

240
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,699
It is my duty to fight.

241
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,035
My honor to sacrifice
for the emperor.

242
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,290
If I were your son,
you wouldn't have to.

243
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,756
I would change nothing
about my life.

244
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,096
We should all get some rest.

245
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,937
I'm leaving in the morning.

246
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:16,558
{\an8}"Loyal, brave, and true."

247
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:07,150
My sword.

248
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,570
My armor! It's gone!

249
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,030
Who would do such a thing?

250
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,033
The conscription scroll.

251
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:19,913
It was Mulan.

252
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,874
You must stop her.

253
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,709
The Northern Invaders
will kill her!

254
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,086
If I expose her lie,
our own people will kill her.

255
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,222
Ancestors,
honored phoenix...

256
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:41,226
ancestral guardian,
I beseech you...

257
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,938
watch over my daughter, Mulan.

258
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,362
She has made
a terrible mistake.

259
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:03,582
<i>I taught her too late
to know her place.</i>

260
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,418
I indulged her.

261
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,922
<i>She is innocent of the world.</i>

262
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,174
Of men.

263
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,385
<i>And the evils of war.</i>

264
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:21,016
<i>And now she's in great danger.</i>

265
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,980
Please, honored phoenix...

266
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,775
<i>protect her.</i>

267
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,871
Our last apple.

268
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,627
You need it more than I do.

269
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,588
We should be there by now.

270
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,050
Do you think we are lost?

271
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,721
The phoenix.

272
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:07,372
<i>There were men gathering
from all over the kingdom.</i>

273
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,626
<i>An alien
and savage tribe to her.</i>

274
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:17,966
<i>To hide amongst them, she knew
she must become one of them.</i>

275
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,891
I'm Cricket.

276
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,394
My mother says I was born
under an auspicious moon.

277
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,483
That is why my mother says
I'm a good luck charm.

278
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:37,986
Ow.

279
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,744
Need a hand, little man?

280
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,123
Insult me again,

281
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,333
and you'll taste
the tip of my blade.

282
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,044
- Lower your sword.
- Or what?

283
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,220
I'm your commanding officer.

284
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,056
Fighting will not be
tolerated. Am I clear?

285
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,391
Yes, Commander.

286
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,769
With your voice, soldier.

287
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,021
Yes, Commander.

288
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,197
What is your name?

289
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,409
Hua Jun, Commander.

290
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:27,786
Is this your family sword?

291
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,498
It belongs to my father,
Hua Zhou.

292
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:37,838
Fall in line.

293
00:30:58,859 --> 00:30:59,860
Sorry, Ling!

294
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,904
Yao, give it back!
It's not funny!

295
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,074
Po, catch!

296
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,330
I told you to line up
for showers.

297
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,665
- Showers?
- Showers.

298
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,167
You lot stink.

299
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,376
And I need a volunteer

300
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,503
- for night guard duty.
- Me!

301
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:21,465
I mean, I volunteer, sir.

302
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:21,793
Stealing.

303
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,630
Penalty, death.

304
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:29,176
Desertion. Penalty, death.

305
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:31,053
Bring women into camp

306
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,764
or consorting with women
in any way.

307
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:37,184
Penalty, death.

308
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,771
Dishonesty.
Penalty...

309
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:47,236
expulsion, disgrace.

310
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:49,905
Disgrace for you,
disgrace for your family...

311
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:55,035
disgrace for your village,
disgrace for your country.

312
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,329
We're going to make men

313
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,748
out of every single
one of you.

314
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:25,107
Ow.

315
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:32,906
Fire!

316
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,037
Only the strongest
will reach the summit.

317
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,291
It will take
everything you have.

318
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,963
Straighten out those arms.

319
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:50,674
Keep them up. Shoulder level.

320
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,386
Keep your mind strong.

321
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,848
Don't stop.

322
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,143
Is he crying?

323
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,534
Fire!

324
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:21,663
Fire!

325
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,966
Give that back!

326
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,026
Longwei!

327
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,278
Report to the barracks
immediately.

328
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:36,905
Immediately.

329
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:43,078
Dishonesty.
Penalty, expulsion.

330
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,248
<i>Disgrace.</i>

331
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,131
We were matched
28 days ago.

332
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,633
Her name is Li Li.

333
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,095
Her skin is white as milk.

334
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:03,390
Her fingers like the tender
white roots of a green onion.

335
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:04,766
Ling is a romantic!

336
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,768
Her eyes
are like morning dewdrops...

337
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,855
I like my women buxom.

338
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:12,065
With strong, wide hips.

339
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:14,693
I like kissing women
with cherry red lips.

340
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:15,819
I don't care
what she looks like.

341
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:18,155
- I agree.
- I care what she cooks like.

342
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,075
Tell us, Hua Jun.

343
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,785
What's your ideal woman?

344
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:30,209
My ideal woman is courageous.

345
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,085
- A courageous woman?
- Yes.

346
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,383
And she has a sense of humor.

347
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,428
- She's also smart.
- Smart?

348
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,763
Well, what does she look like?

349
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,139
That's not the point.

350
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:46,558
Courageous, funny, smart.

351
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,185
Hua Jun's not describing
a woman...

352
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:51,188
...he's describing me.

353
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:53,857
That's not you, Yao.
That's definitely not you.

354
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,486
Not you.

355
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,406
Not you.

356
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,119
Hua Jun.

357
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:08,914
Don't let them bother you.

358
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:11,041
Especially that donkey Yao.

359
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,341
Are you matched? Can I ask?

360
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:20,801
No.

361
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:24,429
I mean, yes. I was.

362
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,682
Almost.

363
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,809
Didn't work out.

364
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:31,645
Lucky you.

365
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,565
I mean, how do you
even begin to know

366
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:35,816
how to talk to a woman...

367
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:37,943
let alone be married to one?

368
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:44,283
Just talk to her like
you are talking to me now.

369
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,494
Yeah, I wish it was that easy.

370
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:53,834
What if she doesn't like me?

371
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:56,920
She will.

372
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,342
I mean,
I think she will, you know?

373
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:04,094
You never know with women.

374
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,854
You should really consider
skipping guard duty

375
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,189
and taking a shower.

376
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,566
You stink, my friend.

377
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:15,976
You idiot.

378
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,604
Now everyone sees it.

379
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,480
You must hide your chi!

380
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:22,482
Hua Jun!

381
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,651
Who knew?

382
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,111
What a killer!

383
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:30,991
You reek, soldier.

384
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,285
Have you even showered
once yet?

385
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,455
You smell bad.

386
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,081
Mm-hmm.

387
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:31,343
Hua Jun.

388
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,303
I'm glad I found you.

389
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,639
I see you're finally
getting clean.

390
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:37,599
The Fifth Battalion
thanks you.

391
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,144
I came here to be alone.

392
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:42,271
What was that today?

393
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:44,314
It was incredible.

394
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,028
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Why not?

395
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:57,744
I can't believe all this time

396
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,037
you've been keeping
your skill a secret.

397
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:00,789
What else
have you been hiding?

398
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,584
Nothing.

399
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,210
Leave me alone.

400
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:09,214
Hua Jun, we started off
on the wrong foot.

401
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,675
Can we be friends?

402
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,552
I'm not your friend.

403
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:18,056
Very well.

404
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:20,058
But you are my equal.

405
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:24,104
We fight together
against the same enemy.

406
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:26,481
I will do all I can
to protect the others.

407
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:31,820
You can turn your back
on me...

408
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:35,741
but when the time comes,
do not turn your back on them.

409
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,427
<i>I welcome the leaders</i>

410
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,638
<i>of the 12 Rouran tribes...</i>

411
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,848
<i>as we approach
the final victory.</i>

412
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:02,392
Soon the Imperial City
will be ours.

413
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,394
But we're relying on a witch.

414
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:06,104
Yes, a witch.

415
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,397
A witch
cannot be trusted!

416
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:09,525
She is no threat.

417
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,735
Hush! Enough!

418
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,363
Make no mistake...

419
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:18,075
the witch serves me
and therefore, all of us.

420
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,619
She knows who her master is.

421
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,126
Consider our future.

422
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,045
This, my friends...

423
00:44:30,212 --> 00:44:33,131
is just a small taste
of what is to come.

424
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,925
From the Imperial City ahead,

425
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:37,553
riches will flow
like a mighty river.

426
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,389
I don't care about riches.

427
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,731
How much gold
can a nomad carry?

428
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:57,531
Then, I will
give you revenge...

429
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,243
for the land we lost
to the empire.

430
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:03,829
For the shame of the last war.

431
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:05,873
For my father,
who the emperor killed.

432
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,751
If gold is not enough...

433
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:13,088
I will give you blood.

434
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,300
Sharpen your swords.

435
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:17,885
Our time has come.

436
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:23,223
Now I know.
I serve you.

437
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,684
I am the slave.

438
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:28,395
And you would
do well to remember it.

439
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:32,566
Over there, witch.
The next garrison.

440
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:35,360
Destroy it.

441
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,831
Hua Jun.

442
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,042
Report to Commander Tung.

443
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:10,521
Hua Jun, Commander.

444
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:12,314
Enter.

445
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,366
Hua Jun.

446
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,291
It seems you have been
hiding something.

447
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:35,838
- Commander...
- I sensed it

448
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,464
the moment I met you.

449
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:39,842
But now I'm sure.

450
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:44,471
You see,
I have a secret as well.

451
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:47,099
I know your father.

452
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:50,102
He was a great soldier.

453
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:51,436
In you, Hua Jun...

454
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,605
I see the shadow of his sword.

455
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:57,025
Perhaps this shadow
falls heavy on your shoulders.

456
00:46:57,776 --> 00:47:00,070
You can't allow your father's
legacy to hold you back.

457
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:02,823
You need to cultivate
your gift.

458
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,491
Sir.

459
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:06,743
Your chi is powerful, Hua Jun.

460
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:08,412
Why do you hide it?

461
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:18,338
I... I don't know.

462
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:33,854
<i>The chi pervades the universe</i>

463
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:35,480
<i>and all living things.</i>

464
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:38,567
<i>We are all born with it.</i>

465
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,490
<i>But only the most true will
connect deeply to his chi...</i>

466
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:47,492
<i>and become a great warrior.</i>

467
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,039
<i>Tranquil as a forest...</i>

468
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:54,082
<i>but on fire within.</i>

469
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,509
The Rouran enemy is vast.

470
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:06,762
<i>They are ruthless
and unpredictable.</i>

471
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:10,432
<i>Yet physical force</i>

472
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:12,684
<i>need not be met
with equal force.</i>

473
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:16,772
The warrior yields to force
and redirects it.

474
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:21,318
<i>Disadvantage can be turned
into an advantage.</i>

475
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:25,656
Four ounces
can move 1,000 pounds.

476
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,012
<i>The garrisons continue to fall</i>

477
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:36,597
<i>to the Northern Invaders.</i>

478
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:38,599
We have been called to war,

479
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:40,642
even though our training
is not finished.

480
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:42,186
We leave to defend

481
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:43,312
the Mountain-Steppe Garrison

482
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:44,855
against the Rouran invader.

483
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:48,775
Up until now, you've been
boys playing soldiers.

484
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:51,653
Today, you become men.

485
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,490
You will now take the oath
of the warrior...

486
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:58,493
pledging fidelity to
the three pillars of virtue.

487
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:01,038
The enemy possesses
none of these...

488
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,665
and therefore can be defeated.

489
00:52:03,832 --> 00:52:07,044
Remember this when you
meet him on the battlefield.

490
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:08,837
Draw sword!

491
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:13,800
- Loyal.
- Loyal!

492
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:15,469
- Brave.
- Brave!

493
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,180
- True.
- True!

494
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,186
Return swords!

495
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,981
In!

496
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:53,799
Commander Tung, it's Hua Jun.

497
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:54,967
You may enter.

498
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,768
Commander Tung,

499
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:06,770
there's something that weighs
heavily on my heart.

500
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:08,522
I need to confess it to you.

501
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:13,443
It has to do
with the three virtues.

502
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,280
There's no shame in being
fearful before battle.

503
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,868
In fact, it's a testament
to your honesty...

504
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,036
that you confess such doubt.

505
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,123
Yes, Commander.
But the other virtues...

506
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:27,624
Hua Jun.

507
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,961
You're a good man.

508
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:34,715
Perhaps one day
you could accompany me

509
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:36,300
to my village...

510
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,051
where I will introduce you
to my daughter.

511
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,889
And our village matchmaker,
of course.

512
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:49,104
Yes, Commander.
That's my great honor.

513
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,648
I look forward
to seeing your father's face

514
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,901
when you give him this news.

515
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:26,892
The Fourth Battalion.

516
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:34,107
This is the work of Böri Khan.

517
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:37,945
There's no one left.

518
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:12,020
The Mountain-Steppe
Garrison welcomes...

519
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:15,065
the Fifth Battalion of
His Majesty's Imperial Army.

520
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,946
Scouts at the gate!

521
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:33,000
Böri Khan assembles not
a half day's ride from here.

522
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:34,251
They prepare for battle.

523
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:35,502
We're greatly outnumbered.

524
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:36,837
Fortify for a siege!

525
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,715
No. He who moves first
controls the enemy.

526
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:43,677
We leave at first light.

527
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,683
Anything you want me
to tell your mothers

528
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:50,976
when you die?

529
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,854
That's not funny.

530
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:56,815
What's the matter? Scared?

531
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:58,901
No.

532
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:01,862
Who knows who will live
past tomorrow?

533
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:05,199
We may never see
each other again.

534
00:56:08,243 --> 00:56:10,162
My father once said...

535
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:13,040
"There is no courage
without fear."

536
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:14,208
So?

537
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,376
So this is natural.

538
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,003
Well, it doesn't feel natural.

539
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:33,143
Listen to me, all of you.

540
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,522
We will live.

541
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:40,859
I guarantee it.

542
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:44,404
Because I will protect you.

543
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:46,949
We'll protect each other.

544
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:49,034
We'll fight for each other.

545
00:56:59,545 --> 00:57:00,671
Except for you, Yao.

546
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:04,132
I might take the opportunity
to kill you myself.

547
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:28,967
They've left the garrison.

548
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,136
A bold move
that changes nothing.

549
00:58:31,303 --> 00:58:32,429
The plan continues.

550
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:34,765
Charge!

551
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:44,274
Spear men, open!

552
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:54,326
Archers, ready!

553
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:57,955
Raise!

554
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:30,028
Release!

555
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,836
The coward retreats!
Pursue them!

556
00:59:45,919 --> 00:59:47,713
Left flank! Charge!

557
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:58,385
You're a witch.

558
01:01:58,468 --> 01:01:59,553
Am I?

559
01:01:59,636 --> 01:02:01,638
And who are you?

560
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:05,976
I'm Hua Jun.

561
01:02:06,143 --> 01:02:08,687
Soldier in the emperor's
Imperial Army.

562
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:17,112
Liar.

563
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:22,284
Your deceit weakens you.

564
01:02:24,203 --> 01:02:26,330
It poisons your chi.

565
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:08,539
I ask again...

566
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:11,124
who are you?

567
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:12,918
I'm Hua Jun.

568
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:15,128
Soldier in the emperor's
Imperial Army!

569
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:16,922
Then you will die

570
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:18,841
pretending to be
something you're not.

571
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:47,578
<i>And Hua Jun did die.</i>

572
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:54,251
<i>For a lie
can only live so long.</i>

573
01:03:58,213 --> 01:03:59,798
<i>But Mulan...</i>

574
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:04,136
<i>Mulan lived.</i>

575
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,245
{\an8}"True."

576
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:37,831
Witch!

577
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:39,458
She's a witch!

578
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,060
Defensive position!

579
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,568
Don't run! We hold formation.

580
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:17,162
Now!

581
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:25,337
Fire!

582
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,052
No!

583
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:36,390
They're targeting us!
We're dead if we stay here!

584
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:17,973
Enemy on the ridge!
Turn around!

585
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:19,975
Fire! Fire!

586
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:26,648
Turn it around!

587
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:28,192
Move it! Move!

588
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:43,248
Fire!

589
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:33,298
Run!

590
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,523
Cricket!

591
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:59,074
Go! Go! Go!

592
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:07,916
Honghui!

593
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,171
Honghui!

594
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:37,714
Gather yourselves.

595
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,217
Find your comrades.

596
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:43,303
The enemy has been defeated.

597
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:46,890
Sergeant Qiang,
regroup the men.

598
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:48,684
Has anyone seen Hua Jun?

599
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:01,238
Have you seen Hua Jun?

600
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:08,495
Hua Jun?

601
01:12:30,142 --> 01:12:31,685
I'm Hua Mulan.

602
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,649
Forgive me.

603
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,158
He's a girl?

604
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:50,454
You are an imposter.

605
01:12:51,205 --> 01:12:52,706
You've betrayed the regiment.

606
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:56,627
You've brought disgrace
to the Hua family.

607
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:59,630
- Commander...
- Your deceit is my shame.

608
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:02,466
Commander,

609
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:04,426
what is the punishment
assigned to this imposter?

610
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:07,513
Expulsion.

611
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:14,019
I would rather be executed.

612
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:17,481
From this moment forward,

613
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:20,859
you are expelled from
the emperor's Imperial Army.

614
01:13:26,406 --> 01:13:28,617
If you show your face again...

615
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:32,829
your wish to be executed
will be granted.

616
01:14:16,081 --> 01:14:17,958
<i>You can never go home.</i>

617
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,587
<i>Your disgrace
is worse than death.</i>

618
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:37,477
I understand.

619
01:14:40,564 --> 01:14:45,402
I was a girl like you
when people turned on me.

620
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:53,368
You don't think
I longed for a noble path?

621
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:59,249
I've lived a life of exile.

622
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:04,963
No country,
no village, no family.

623
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:10,636
We are the same.

624
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:13,972
- We're not.
- We are.

625
01:15:14,932 --> 01:15:18,310
The more power I showed,
the more I was crushed.

626
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:20,854
Just like you.

627
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:25,526
You saved them today
and still they turned on you.

628
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,904
You are just at the beginning
of your power.

629
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:32,366
Merge your path with mine.

630
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,577
We will be stronger together.

631
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:42,501
You follow a coward.
A leader who runs from battle.

632
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:45,838
Böri Khan
did not run from battle.

633
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:49,925
That coward
will take the Imperial City...

634
01:15:50,092 --> 01:15:52,219
and your emperor will fall.

635
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:55,889
That can't happen.

636
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:58,642
But it happens even now.

637
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:05,107
Join me.

638
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:09,319
We will take our place
together.

639
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:19,288
I know my place.

640
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,749
And it is my duty...

641
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:27,254
to fight for the kingdom
and protect the emperor.

642
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,574
Commander Tung!

643
01:16:58,076 --> 01:16:59,244
What is the meaning of this?

644
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,288
Commander Tung,
we must ride to the emperor.

645
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:02,789
His life is in danger.

646
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:04,875
The emperor's life
has never been safer.

647
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:06,460
That's what Böri Khan
wants you to believe.

648
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:12,090
Please,
you have to listen to me.

649
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:14,885
Sergeant, hand me my sword.

650
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:22,768
Kill me if you must.
But first, listen.

651
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:26,480
The garrison attacks
were just a distraction.

652
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,983
Khan has our army focused
on the Silk Road...

653
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,610
so he can sneak
into the Imperial City

654
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,195
and kill the emperor.

655
01:17:34,446 --> 01:17:36,323
Böri Khan
is already far ahead.

656
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:38,450
The Imperial Army
can't stop him now.

657
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:43,038
But perhaps a small,
well-trained force could.

658
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:46,750
When employed correctly...

659
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:51,421
four ounces
can move 1,000 pounds.

660
01:17:54,508 --> 01:17:58,387
Only a foolish man listens to
someone whose very existence

661
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:59,888
is a lie.

662
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,647
You would believe Hua Jun.

663
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,315
Why do you not believe
Hua Mulan?

664
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:14,444
She risked everything by
revealing her true identity.

665
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,240
She's braver
than any man here.

666
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,828
And she's the best warrior
amongst us.

667
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:28,208
- I believe Hua Mulan.
- I believe Hua Mulan.

668
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,752
- I believe Hua Mulan.
- I believe Hua Mulan.

669
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:31,920
I believe Hua Mulan.

670
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,088
I believe Hua Mulan.

671
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:43,974
Hua Mulan...

672
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,227
your actions have brought
disgrace and dishonor

673
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:48,687
to this regiment...

674
01:18:48,854 --> 01:18:52,065
to this kingdom
and to your own family.

675
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:56,570
But your loyalty and bravery
are without question.

676
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:02,492
You will lead us as we ride
to the Imperial City.

677
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:07,539
Ready the horses.

678
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:28,662
Your Majesty, a word.
In private.

679
01:20:31,248 --> 01:20:34,376
Despite the Rouran army's
crushing defeat...

680
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:35,836
scouts have informed me

681
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:37,838
that Böri Khan
has infiltrated the city.

682
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:40,841
He assembles
at the New Palace.

683
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:43,343
He offers a duel.

684
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:45,095
Prepare my guards.

685
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:47,973
We ride
to the site immediately.

686
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:51,059
Your Majesty,
it is far too dangerous.

687
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:52,269
Silence!

688
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:54,521
My people
have suffered enough.

689
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,732
Now I must act.

690
01:20:56,899 --> 01:21:01,904
I will kill this Böri Khan
like I killed his father.

691
01:21:02,112 --> 01:21:03,780
With my own hands.

692
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:21,798
Assemble
all Imperial guardsmen

693
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:23,634
immediately in this square.

694
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:28,305
That includes every guard
on every tower and every gate.

695
01:21:28,472 --> 01:21:30,307
But who will protect the city?

696
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:34,353
You question the judgement
of His Majesty the Emperor?

697
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:38,857
Of course not, Chancellor.
I will see to it immediately.

698
01:22:02,881 --> 01:22:03,882
It's time.

699
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:19,648
The gates are open!

700
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:22,818
The streets are empty!
Why are there no guards?

701
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,341
Ambush!

702
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,093
Protect the emperor!

703
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:49,344
Clear her path!

704
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:52,598
Don't leave her side!
She must get through.

705
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:46,610
Surely you didn't
expect a fair fight?

706
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:50,155
How did you convince
my chancellor to betray me?

707
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:52,074
That was not your chancellor.

708
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:53,450
Now!

709
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:07,089
Join the others.
Take the city.

710
01:24:07,256 --> 01:24:09,716
Kill every
last Imperial soldier.

711
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:22,062
You need to find the emperor.

712
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:23,856
We'll hold them back.

713
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:26,275
Till next we meet, Honghui.

714
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:00,350
Go! Go!

715
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:02,603
Bolt the door.

716
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:05,606
Bolt the door.

717
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:32,341
Your Majesty, I'm Hua Mulan
from the Fifth Battalion.

718
01:25:32,508 --> 01:25:33,634
I've come to protect you.

719
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:36,136
Impossible.

720
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:45,896
A woman leading a man's army.

721
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:48,315
Where's the emperor?

722
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:57,491
You were right.

723
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:00,160
We are the same.

724
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:01,870
With one difference.

725
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:07,417
They accept you,
but they will never accept me.

726
01:26:07,584 --> 01:26:09,837
You told me
my journey was impossible.

727
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:14,716
Yet here I stand.

728
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,469
Proof that there is a place
for people like us.

729
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,429
No.

730
01:26:23,642 --> 01:26:25,352
It's too late for me.

731
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:32,359
You can still take
the noble path.

732
01:26:39,449 --> 01:26:41,076
It's not too late.

733
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:42,953
Please.

734
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:46,999
I need your help.

735
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:49,585
Where's the emperor?

736
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:48,769
They tell me
this palace is being built

737
01:27:48,852 --> 01:27:50,562
in honor of your father.

738
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:54,191
And in honor of my father...

739
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,237
this is where you will die.

740
01:28:00,822 --> 01:28:03,575
Or should I say "burn"?

741
01:28:05,869 --> 01:28:08,372
Who will come to save you,
Son of Heaven?

742
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:10,624
Where are the sons
of the empire?

743
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:12,876
I will tell you.

744
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:17,381
Fallen to our swords.
Pierced by our arrows.

745
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:21,885
Who will save you?

746
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:35,357
Why are you here?

747
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:38,777
The attack has met
a fierce resistance.

748
01:28:38,944 --> 01:28:40,571
- From who?
- A young woman...

749
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:42,531
from a small village.

750
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,408
A girl?

751
01:28:44,575 --> 01:28:46,410
A woman.

752
01:28:46,493 --> 01:28:47,536
A warrior.

753
01:28:50,956 --> 01:28:53,125
A woman leads the army.

754
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:57,129
And she's no scorned dog.

755
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:01,550
You led her here.

756
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:28,493
Take your place...

757
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,121
Mulan.

758
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:56,415
The girl who has come
to save the dynasty.

759
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:27,613
No!

760
01:31:44,421 --> 01:31:45,756
Rise up.

761
01:31:47,841 --> 01:31:49,843
You are a mighty warrior.

762
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:52,304
Rise up like a phoenix.

763
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:55,641
Fight for the kingdom
and its people.

764
01:34:39,596 --> 01:34:40,681
<i>Stand up, soldier.</i>

765
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:53,277
Tell me your name.

766
01:35:24,558 --> 01:35:27,686
Your Imperial Highness,
Hua Mulan.

767
01:35:41,491 --> 01:35:45,412
Hua Mulan, the people owe you
a debt of thanks.

768
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:48,373
I owe you my life.

769
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:52,836
In gratitude for your service
and dedication...

770
01:35:53,003 --> 01:35:55,297
I invite you
to take your place...

771
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:58,675
with our greatest
decorated warriors...

772
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:03,013
as an officer
in the Emperor's Guard.

773
01:36:05,015 --> 01:36:06,642
Your Majesty...

774
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:11,063
I'm deeply honored by this
immeasurable invitation...

775
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:14,149
but with humble apologies...

776
01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:17,778
I cannot accept it.

777
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:28,372
I left home
under cover of darkness...

778
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:31,500
and betrayed
my family's trust.

779
01:36:33,669 --> 01:36:36,880
I made choices I knew
would risk their dishonor.

780
01:36:38,382 --> 01:36:39,424
Since then...

781
01:36:41,051 --> 01:36:42,427
I have pledged an oath...

782
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:47,599
to be loyal, brave, and true.

783
01:36:51,395 --> 01:36:53,730
In order to fulfill
this oath...

784
01:36:54,731 --> 01:37:00,237
I must return home
and make amends to my family.

785
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:04,449
Very well, Hua Mulan.

786
01:37:08,662 --> 01:37:12,916
Devotion to family
is an essential virtue.

787
01:37:28,265 --> 01:37:29,266
You can't leave.

788
01:37:37,316 --> 01:37:39,151
The emperor
gives his permission...

789
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:40,611
but you do not?

790
01:37:43,197 --> 01:37:44,406
We've not yet said goodbye.

791
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:53,207
Goodbye, Honghui.

792
01:38:01,965 --> 01:38:03,675
You still won't take my hand?

793
01:38:21,902 --> 01:38:23,737
I will see you again,
Hua Mulan.

794
01:38:54,935 --> 01:38:55,936
Mulan has returned!

795
01:38:56,019 --> 01:38:57,563
Mulan!

796
01:38:59,857 --> 01:39:00,983
Mulan?

797
01:39:02,693 --> 01:39:03,694
Mother!

798
01:39:04,528 --> 01:39:05,529
Mulan!

799
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:49,364
There is so much
I have to ask you.

800
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:50,741
Tell me about you first.

801
01:39:50,866 --> 01:39:52,492
I... I am matched!

802
01:39:52,576 --> 01:39:53,702
What's he like?

803
01:39:53,785 --> 01:39:55,329
He's handsome, a little shy,

804
01:39:55,412 --> 01:39:56,413
but he's not afraid
of spiders.

805
01:39:56,496 --> 01:39:57,831
- Mulan!
- I'm so happy for you.

806
01:40:27,277 --> 01:40:29,154
Forgive me, Father.

807
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:35,118
I stole your horse...

808
01:40:35,244 --> 01:40:39,164
I stole your sword,
I stole your armor.

809
01:40:41,792 --> 01:40:44,711
And the sword... I lost it.

810
01:40:46,797 --> 01:40:48,507
The sword is gone.

811
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,344
Now I understand...

812
01:40:53,929 --> 01:40:56,223
how much that sword
means to you.

813
01:41:01,687 --> 01:41:06,316
It is my daughter
that means everything to me.

814
01:41:09,444 --> 01:41:13,615
And it is I should apologize.

815
01:41:16,952 --> 01:41:19,830
My foolish pride
drove you away.

816
01:41:31,466 --> 01:41:33,635
One warrior knows another.

817
01:41:35,637 --> 01:41:38,390
You were always there...

818
01:41:38,473 --> 01:41:41,393
yet I see you
for the first time.

819
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,637
Hello, old friend.

820
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:22,392
Tung Yong...

821
01:42:23,185 --> 01:42:26,605
I am honored to receive you
and the Emperor's Guard.

822
01:42:27,523 --> 01:42:30,567
But if you are here
to discipline Mulan...

823
01:42:31,318 --> 01:42:33,028
you have to get past me.

824
01:42:33,987 --> 01:42:35,989
I do not believe
that will be necessary.

825
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:40,536
Under order

826
01:42:40,619 --> 01:42:42,829
of His Imperial Majesty
the Emperor,

827
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:46,208
we present this gift
to Hua Mulan.

828
01:42:47,668 --> 01:42:49,503
She has saved the dynasty.

829
01:42:50,879 --> 01:42:53,382
The entire kingdom
is in her debt.

830
01:43:04,852 --> 01:43:06,228
She has brought honor

831
01:43:06,353 --> 01:43:08,272
to her ancestors...

832
01:43:08,438 --> 01:43:11,441
to her family,
to her village...

833
01:43:12,609 --> 01:43:14,361
and to her country.

834
01:43:14,528 --> 01:43:16,029
As befits a great warrior...

835
01:43:16,196 --> 01:43:17,906
the sword is marked
with the pillars of virtue.

836
01:43:18,782 --> 01:43:23,495
Loyal, brave, true.

837
01:43:30,711 --> 01:43:32,629
And what is this fourth virtue
I see?

838
01:43:32,796 --> 01:43:34,173
Read it aloud, Mulan.

839
01:43:35,841 --> 01:43:37,426
"Devotion to family."

840
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:40,512
You have brought honor
to us all.

841
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:41,889
The emperor urges you

842
01:43:41,972 --> 01:43:43,932
to reconsider his invitation

843
01:43:44,099 --> 01:43:46,518
to join our greatest
decorated warriors...

844
01:43:47,186 --> 01:43:49,771
as an officer
in the Emperor's Guard.

845
01:43:54,401 --> 01:43:56,361
He awaits your decision.

846
01:44:11,335 --> 01:44:14,129
<i>The green shoot
has grown up to the sky...</i>

847
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:17,549
<i>and her ancestors
celebrate her</i>

848
01:44:17,633 --> 01:44:19,343
<i>in the vault of the heavens.</i>

849
01:44:22,721 --> 01:44:24,806
<i>The girl became a soldier.</i>

850
01:44:25,557 --> 01:44:27,184
<i>The soldier became a leader.</i>

851
01:44:28,894 --> 01:44:30,646
<i>And the leader...</i>

852
01:44:31,605 --> 01:44:33,482
<i>became a legend.</i>

853
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:56,839
<i>War is not freedom</i>

854
01:44:56,922 --> 01:44:59,341
<i>Over my shoulder</i>

855
01:44:59,424 --> 01:45:02,636
<i>I see a clearer view</i>

856
01:45:04,471 --> 01:45:06,932
<i>All for my family</i>

857
01:45:07,015 --> 01:45:09,476
<i>Reason I'm breathing</i>

858
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,896
<i>Everything to lose</i>

859
01:45:14,106 --> 01:45:18,318
<i>Should I ask myself
in the water</i>

860
01:45:19,069 --> 01:45:22,739
<i>What a warrior would do?</i>

861
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:28,453
<i>Tell me underneath my armor</i>

862
01:45:29,204 --> 01:45:32,875
<i>Am I loyal, brave, and true?</i>

863
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:38,046
<i>Am I loyal, brave, and true?</i>

864
01:45:49,766 --> 01:45:52,269
<i>Losing is easy</i>

865
01:45:52,352 --> 01:45:54,813
<i>Winning takes bravery</i>

866
01:45:54,897 --> 01:45:58,192
<i>I am a tiger's fool</i>

867
01:45:59,776 --> 01:46:02,321
<i>Out in the open</i>

868
01:46:02,404 --> 01:46:04,781
<i>No one to save me</i>

869
01:46:04,865 --> 01:46:08,493
<i>The kindest of whispers
are cruel</i>

870
01:46:09,453 --> 01:46:13,749
{\an8}<i>Should I ask myself</i>
<i>in the water</i>

871
01:46:14,499 --> 01:46:18,128
{\an8}<i>What a warrior would do?</i>

872
01:46:19,588 --> 01:46:23,759
{\an8}<i>Tell me underneath my armor</i>

873
01:46:24,676 --> 01:46:28,472
{\an8}<i>Am I loyal, brave, and true?</i>

874
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:33,644
{\an8}<i>Am I loyal, brave, and true?</i>

875
01:46:33,727 --> 01:46:36,271
{\an8}<i>Cold is the morning</i>

876
01:46:36,355 --> 01:46:38,774
{\an8}<i>Warm is the dream</i>

877
01:46:38,857 --> 01:46:41,276
{\an8}<i>Chasing the answers</i>

878
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,946
{\an8}<i>'Til I can't sleep</i>

879
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:46,240
{\an8}<i>Will I be stronger</i>

880
01:46:46,323 --> 01:46:48,700
<i>Or will I be weak</i>

881
01:46:48,784 --> 01:46:52,871
<i>When you're not with me?</i>

882
01:46:54,915 --> 01:46:58,961
{\an8}<i>Who am I without my armor</i>

883
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,924
{\an8}<i>Standing in my father's shoes?</i>

884
01:47:05,008 --> 01:47:09,304
<i>All I know is that it's harder</i>

885
01:47:10,264 --> 01:47:15,853
<i>To be loyal, brave, and true</i>

886
01:47:31,493 --> 01:47:33,787
<i>Look at me</i>

887
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:36,331
<i>You may think you see</i>

888
01:47:36,415 --> 01:47:39,001
<i>Who I really am</i>

889
01:47:39,084 --> 01:47:41,587
<i>But you'll never know me</i>

890
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:43,964
<i>Every day</i>

891
01:47:44,047 --> 01:47:49,094
<i>It's as if I play a part</i>

892
01:47:49,178 --> 01:47:51,221
<i>Now I see</i>

893
01:47:51,305 --> 01:47:53,807
<i>If I wear a mask</i>

894
01:47:53,891 --> 01:47:56,518
<i>I can fool the world</i>

895
01:47:56,602 --> 01:48:01,315
<i>But I cannot fool my heart</i>

896
01:48:04,109 --> 01:48:08,947
<i>Who is that girl I see</i>

897
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:14,077
<i>Staring straight back at me?</i>

898
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:19,208
<i>When will my reflection show</i>

899
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:26,256
<i>Who I am inside?</i>

900
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,842
<i>I am now</i>

901
01:48:28,926 --> 01:48:34,014
<i>In a world
where I have to hide my heart</i>

902
01:48:34,097 --> 01:48:36,600
<i>And what I believe in</i>

903
01:48:36,683 --> 01:48:38,727
<i>But somehow</i>

904
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:43,982
<i>I will show the world
what's inside my heart</i>

905
01:48:44,066 --> 01:48:49,029
<i>And be loved for who I am</i>

906
01:48:51,657 --> 01:48:56,703
<i>Who is that girl I see</i>

907
01:48:56,787 --> 01:49:01,542
<i>Staring straight back at me?</i>

908
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:06,755
<i>Why is my reflection someone</i>

909
01:49:06,839 --> 01:49:11,051
<i>I don't know?</i>

910
01:49:11,718 --> 01:49:14,888
<i>Must I pretend</i>

911
01:49:14,972 --> 01:49:21,520
<i>That I'm someone else
for all time?</i>

912
01:49:21,603 --> 01:49:26,692
<i>When will my reflection show</i>

913
01:49:27,067 --> 01:49:31,113
<i>Who I am inside?</i>

914
01:49:31,196 --> 01:49:35,701
<i>There's a heart
that must be free</i>

915
01:49:35,784 --> 01:49:38,537
<i>To fly</i>

916
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:43,876
<i>That burns with a need to know</i>

917
01:49:43,959 --> 01:49:49,256
<i>The reason why</i>

918
01:49:49,339 --> 01:49:54,511
<i>Why must we all conceal</i>

919
01:49:54,636 --> 01:49:59,266
<i>What we think, how we feel?</i>

920
01:49:59,349 --> 01:50:03,979
<i>Must there be a secret me</i>

921
01:50:04,062 --> 01:50:09,193
<i>I'm forced to hide?</i>

922
01:50:09,276 --> 01:50:14,531
<i>I won't pretend that I'm</i>

923
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:19,203
<i>Someone else for all time</i>

924
01:50:19,286 --> 01:50:24,666
<i>When will my reflection show</i>

925
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:31,715
<i>Who I am inside?</i>

926
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:42,684
<i>When will my reflection show</i>

927
01:50:43,685 --> 01:50:50,651
<i>Who I am inside?</i>

928
01:51:08,418 --> 01:51:13,418
