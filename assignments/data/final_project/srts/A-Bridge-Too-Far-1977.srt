1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,755
It's hard to remember now,
but Europe was like this in 1944.

2
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,012
The Second World War
was in its fifth year...

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,515
...and still going Hitler's way.

4
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,226
German troops
controlled most of Europe.

5
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,231
D-Day changed all that.

6
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,528
D-Day: June 6, 1944...

7
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,907
...when the Allied forces, under
their commander General Eisenhower...

8
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,202
...landed on the northern
coast of France.

9
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,205
By July they were able
to begin their own offensive.

10
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,917
By August, Paris was liberated.

11
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,922
Everywhere the Germans retreated.

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,926
But with the Allied victories
came problems.

13
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,556
Supplies still had to be driven
from Normandy, over 400 miles away...

14
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,017
...and became dangerously short.

15
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,311
The Allied advance
began to come to a halt.

16
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,609
Another problem
facing Eisenhower was this:

17
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,070
His two most famous generals...
Patton, who was in the south...

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,784
...and Montgomery in the north...
disliked each other intensely.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,538
The longstanding rivalry
had never been more fierce.

20
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,000
There simply were not
enough supplies for both armies.

21
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,337
Each wanted to be the one
to defeat the Germans.

22
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,423
Each wanted to beat
the other to Berlin.

23
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,551
In September, 1944...

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,221
Montgomery devised
a new and spectacular plan...

25
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,390
...given the code name
"Market Garden."

26
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,811
Eisenhower, under great pressure
from his superiors...

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,313
...finally sided with Montgomery...

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,234
...and Operation Market Garden
became a reality.

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,323
The plan, like so many plans
in so many wars before it...

30
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,035
...was meant to end
the fighting by Christmas...

31
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,955
...and bring the boys back home.

32
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,763
What is that noise?

33
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,604
- Can I look out?
- No, they might shoot us.

34
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,238
The Germans have collapsed.

35
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,786
Then the war is over?

36
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,122
Soon.

37
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,708
But what is that noise?

38
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,587
Panic.

39
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,409
You may begin.

40
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,705
May I first be permitted to say,
and I think I speak for all of us...

41
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,792
...how pleased we are,
Field Marshal Von Rundstedt...

42
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,586
...that you have been reappointed
commander of our forces in the West.

43
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,797
Speeches are for
victory celebrations.

44
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,758
Let's get to the point.
Air power?

45
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,469
Air power, Field Marshal?

46
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,845
Briefly, please.

47
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:35,808
- Air power is minimal.
- Ammunition?

48
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,518
Also minimal.

49
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,770
Tanks... Troops...
Replacements?

50
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,480
- Minimal.
- Morale?

51
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,784
Nonexistent.

52
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,997
What do you think
we should do?

53
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,709
End the war, you fools.

54
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,921
- Why in the world are you laughing?
- Excuse us.

55
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,299
We have such confidence in you.

56
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,843
Everyone knows you have
never lost a battle.

57
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,181
I'm still young.
Give me time.

58
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,104
The first thing we must do...

59
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:26,483
...is to turn this rabble
into something like an army.

60
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,866
Anything at all on when
they plan to invade Holland?

61
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,620
They seem to have
paused in Belgium.

62
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,664
Most likely supply problems.

63
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,750
Otherwise we can't imagine why.

64
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,965
I think it's because
we're retreating...

65
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,510
...faster than they can advance.

66
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,335
How many vehicles
in the past hour?

67
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,796
Fifty-four.

68
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,674
And for the same hour yesterday?

69
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,968
Ninety-eight.

70
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,347
Last week your mother and I
could have captured Holland alone.

71
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,600
Already the panic has stopped.

72
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,479
It isn't over yet
and those idiots don't realize it.

73
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:49,108
- War takes time.
- Listen to the expert.

74
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,110
I was nine when they got here.

75
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:54,196
Next month I'll be 14.
I ought to know something.

76
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,120
Father, the Allies will come?

77
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,041
But when?

78
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,008
I've just got back to England
from Brussels...

79
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:18,179
...where I had a meeting this morning
with Field Marshal Montgomery.

80
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,556
There was an earlier one
with General Eisenhower.

81
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,642
They both feel, as I do...

82
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,437
...that when the Field Marshal's plan
has succeeded...

83
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,064
...we should be able
to end the war by Christmas...

84
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,233
...in less than 100 days.

85
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,363
Actually, the plan
is really very simple.

86
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,870
We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles,
and drop them behind enemy lines.

87
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,875
It'll be the largest
airborne operation ever mounted.

88
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,007
Quite frankly, this kind of thing's
never been attempted before.

89
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,720
- Where's this all going to take place?
- Holland.

90
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,723
- And when?
- I'm coming to that now.

91
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,059
Right.

92
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,024
The ground forces: 30 Corps, commanded
by General Horrocks, 20,000 vehicles.

93
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,611
And this, as you know,
is the German front line.

94
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:19,323
Now we're going to lay a carpet,
as it were, of airborne troops...

95
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,700
...over which 30th Corps can pass.

96
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,579
We shall seize the bridges...
it's all a question of bridges...

97
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,790
With thunderclap surprise...

98
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:30,626
...and hold them until
they can be secured.

99
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,047
Now first of all,
General Maxwell Taylor...

100
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,758
...Eindhoven.

101
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,679
You take and hold
the bridges there with 101 st.

102
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:46,767
General Gavin,
with your 82nd...

103
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,811
...you get Nijmegen.

104
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:50,813
You take and hold the bridges.

105
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,066
And Roy, you get the prize:
Arnhem.

106
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,402
Arnhem Bridge.

107
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,364
- And you hold it.
- For how long?

108
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,409
Monty assures me that 30 Corps...

109
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,955
...will do the 63 miles
in two days.

110
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,167
Sixty-three miles in two days.

111
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,211
- They oughta be able to handle that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

112
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,549
General Sosabowski, you go with
your Polish Brigade with Roy Urquhart.

113
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,259
I'm so sorry.

114
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,595
Roy...

115
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,432
...when you've secured
your bridge...

116
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,977
...and 30th Corps have got across it,
we can turn east...

117
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:33,814
...right into the industrial heart
of Germany... the Ruhr.

118
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,276
Once we control their factories,
there's not much they can do about it.

119
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:39,904
And that is the plan.

120
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,740
And we go next Sunday.

121
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,325
Seven days?

122
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:47,286
Why not?
The sooner we go, the better.

123
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:49,538
We've got them on the run.

124
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,794
Is something troubling you,
General Sosabowski?

125
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,923
- I've said nothing.
- Precisely.

126
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:01,759
Your silences are thunderous.

127
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,723
General Browning, I...

128
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:10,684
I am a Pole...

129
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,896
...considered by some
to be smart.

130
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,606
If that is so...

131
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:19,652
...it makes me member
of a true minority group.

132
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:23,114
Minority groups
are more comfortable in silence.

133
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,284
I should have thought the opposite
was true. But you do disapprove?

134
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:31,122
I am thrilled that your great Field
Marshal Montgomery has devised a plan.

135
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,458
I promise you, I'll be
properly ecstatic if it works.

136
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,501
When it works.

137
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:38,087
Of course.
When it works.

138
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:39,755
Thank you.

139
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,385
Well, now let's
get down to the details.

140
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,138
First we shall have to have...

141
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,307
From which direction will their
attack come, and who will command?

142
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,393
Montgomery or Patton?

143
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,147
- Model, what do you think?
- Patton.

144
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,316
He is their best.

145
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,861
Patton will lead the assault.

146
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:05,072
I would prefer Montgomery...

147
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,658
...but even Eisenhower
isn't that stupid.

148
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,831
Bittrich's panzer troops
need some rest...

149
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,626
...if they're to stop Patton.

150
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:22,006
We should pull them back
somewhere safe.

151
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:26,093
Safe, quiet, out of the way.
But where?

152
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,803
Arnhem?

153
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,644
Arnhem.

154
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,730
- I'll be in touch.
- That'll be fine.

155
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,319
Why the emergency meeting?

156
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:47,365
- Keeping abreast of the little changes.
- How big are the little changes?

157
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,826
I'll answer you with typical
British understatement: gigantic.

158
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,828
They can't get us
all in at once.

159
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,498
Too many men, too much equipment,
not enough planes.

160
00:15:55,665 --> 00:16:00,169
It's going to take three days to get the
men into Arnhem, Poles and the British.

161
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,338
- How about us?
- We'll be all right.

162
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:06,342
Aside from the fact that we'll parachute
in daylight, we have no worries.

163
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,219
Daylight?

164
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:12,014
- Has it ever been tried before?
- Not in a major drop.

165
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:15,559
- Think there might be a reason for that?
- Let's hope not.

166
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,561
- What do you think?
- It'll be all right.

167
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,648
It's a "no moon" period anyway.
We have to go in daylight.

168
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:23,484
Just so they get us over
the target area, half a mile away.

169
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,569
Three-quarters of a mile...
I'll settle for that.

170
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,239
I don't want to hear anything else.

171
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:32,034
- Is there anything else?
- Well, you're my Dutch advisor, Harry.

172
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,120
I forgot to tell you something?

173
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:36,956
Only that the Germans first tried
to take Nijmegen Bridge themselves...

174
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:40,376
...back in 1940,
and got slaughtered.

175
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,341
Go back!

176
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,595
Go back!

177
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,890
Do as I say!

178
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:58,394
But my friend lives
down the road.

179
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,773
It's my birthday
and she has a present for me.

180
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,402
Please let me through.

181
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:15,661
All right. Be quick.

182
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,716
Are you sure about the colors?

183
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:31,260
I'm sure, Father.
Believe me.

184
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,765
Model?

185
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:40,061
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?

186
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,397
The British will have
an explanation.

187
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,399
Did you pass on
the message about the tanks?

188
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,444
Of course. But Model is
something more important.

189
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:53,074
You're a good boy
and a wonderful spy.

190
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,660
Now go and help
your mother with supper.

191
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,416
- Sir?
- Yes, Fuller?

192
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,669
- We've got some information on tanks.
- What?

193
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,046
Dutch Underground reports
from the Arnhem area.

194
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,632
- Established their strength?
- No, sir, but I've got...

195
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,426
- Have they been identified?
- Not by our intelligence, sir.

196
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,929
So it's the same rumors
as before, right?

197
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:17,723
- I believe these rumors, sir.
- Why?

198
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,142
The general consensus of opinion
is that our opposition...

199
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,937
...will consist entirely of Hitler Youth
or old men on bicycles.

200
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,939
I don't really know why, sir.

201
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,483
Perhaps because no one
in Intelligence does.

202
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,403
I just want to be sure
our airborne carpet...

203
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,573
...consists of live troops,
not dead ones.

204
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,118
I know everybody thinks
I'm overanxious, sir...

205
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:40,454
...but I would like to order another
low-level reconnaissance of the area.

206
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,124
If that's all right
with you, sir.

207
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:46,836
Very well.

208
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:49,505
All right, Wilson.

209
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,257
Very well.

210
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:57,930
I wouldn't be too concerned
about what people think of you.

211
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:01,642
You happen to be somewhat
brighter than most of us.

212
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,895
Tends to make us nervous.

213
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:18,159
Naturally we'll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements, sir.

214
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,203
But please keep in mind...

215
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,539
...the one factor which is
crippling all our plans.

216
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:25,791
It may seem improbable to you...

217
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,836
...but we are desperately short
of transport aircraft.

218
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:30,129
I am aware of that.

219
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:33,841
I was surprised that nobody mentioned it
to Monty when he dreamed up this plan.

220
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,887
I need drop zones as close
as possible to the bridge.

221
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:40,014
This area's no use at all.

222
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:44,685
Can't have my chaps landing on chimney
tops, but this looks inviting here.

223
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,522
- What's the terrain like?
- Sorry, sir.

224
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:51,359
Our reports indicate that this terrain
is too soft for glider landings.

225
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:54,403
The nose digs in first on touchdown,
the thing goes ass over tip.

226
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,614
Total write-off.

227
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:58,282
All right.

228
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,493
- What about there?
- Afraid not, sir.

229
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,496
You see, after the drop,
when we bank for our return...

230
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,498
...we run into
a whole lot of flak...

231
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,501
...from this Jerry airfield
up here at Deelen.

232
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:11,420
Presumably you're intending
to let us land somewhere?

233
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,007
Oh, yes.
Hopefully, sir.

234
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:19,804
But as I was saying, we cannot afford
to lose a single aircraft.

235
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,806
That is the problem.

236
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:25,560
My problem is,
I don't just need drop zones.

237
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,813
I need drop zones
I can hold and defend.

238
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,399
The rest of my division arrives
with the second drop...

239
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,277
...and General Sosabowski's
Polish Brigade with the third.

240
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:37,989
I understand, sir, but we really
think we've found the right place.

241
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:41,534
It's large enough for your needs,
it's flat and firm.

242
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:44,537
- It's also easily defended.
- Where the hell is it?

243
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:47,874
Well, it's not actually
on this photograph.

244
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,209
It should be...
Excuse me, sir...

245
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:53,421
It would be about here,
I think.

246
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,217
That could be
ten miles from the bridge.

247
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:01,637
It's just under eight actually, sir,
if you'd like to have a look at this.

248
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,852
You see, the terrain
is easy to traverse.

249
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,689
All our information
substantiates that.

250
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,192
Yes, sir?

251
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:18,070
Just making sure
whose side you're on.

252
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:11,582
Now, a drop zone
eight miles from Arnhem Bridge...

253
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:14,043
...might be thought by some
to present problems.

254
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,129
My God, he can't mean it.

255
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:19,715
I'm afraid he does.
Must know what he's doing.

256
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:23,344
That's more than I know. Why should
he have a corner on the market?

257
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:27,432
...cannot under any stretch
of the imagination be considered ideal.

258
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:31,519
But the gliders will be bringing in
a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps...

259
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:34,730
...specially fitted
with twin Vickers machine guns.

260
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:38,276
The instant we land,
they will race ahead to the bridge...

261
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,944
...and hold it...

262
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:42,530
...until the other battalions
arrive on foot.

263
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:45,158
And they'll be quick enough
to secure both ends of Arnhem Bridge?

264
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,368
- Most certainly.
- Good.

265
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:51,456
My headquarters will be
in the center with 82nd.

266
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,125
Now, just you remember that
we're all totally interlocked.

267
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:56,252
This is a bottom-to-top operation.

268
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:59,672
101 st pass 30 Corps
on to 82nd.

269
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,092
82nd pass them on
to British Airborne.

270
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,970
If any one group fails,
it's total failure for us all.

271
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:12,310
All we need now
are three days of clear skies.

272
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:14,479
Thank you, gentlemen,
very much.

273
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:18,441
Only the weather
can stop us now.

274
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,902
<i>Weather! Cristos! </i>

275
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:29,118
What of the Germans?
Don't you think that since we know...

276
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,038
...that Arnhem is so crucial to their
safety, they might know that too?

277
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,581
Now look here.

278
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,376
The few troops
in the area are...

279
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:38,795
...second class.

280
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:40,922
They're not front-line caliber.

281
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,299
Not at all.
Do you understand?

282
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:47,178
You ought to have more faith
in Montgomery's intelligence reports.

283
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:50,014
He's done pretty well for us
in the last three or four years.

284
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:51,933
I will tell you
the extent of my faith.

285
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:56,020
I'm thinking of asking
for a letter from you...

286
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:58,981
...stating that I was forced
to act on your orders...

287
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:01,859
...in case my men are massacred.

288
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,570
I see.

289
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,825
Yes, I do see.

290
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:13,955
Do you wish such a letter?

291
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,253
Of course not.

292
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,132
In the case of massacre,
what difference would it make?

293
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:38,021
- You don't believe me, sir?
- Clearly not.

294
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:40,773
All right, boys, Naafi's up.
Take your break.

295
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:44,027
God Almighty!

296
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,904
Sorry about that, sir.
But what then?

297
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:49,198
I just don't believe these
damn radios are strong enough...

298
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:52,243
...to carry the eight miles
from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.

299
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,121
Don't happen to have
any cigarettes, do you, sir?

300
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:58,666
They're perfectly okay.
I've used them God knows how many times.

301
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,461
You've already told me that
God knows how many times.

302
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:04,839
Well, I didn't have any problems
with them in the desert.

303
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:07,633
Yes, I know,
but you see, Cole...

304
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,679
...what genuinely and truly has me more
than a bit disturbed is that Holland...

305
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:16,184
...being half underwater, is soggier
than most deserts you're apt to find.

306
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,854
Tends to have
a lot more trees.

307
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:22,857
- Any biscuits?
- Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

308
00:25:24,484 --> 00:25:26,736
Shouldn't you tell the general
if you're so certain about it, sir?

309
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:29,489
If I were,
believe me, I would.

310
00:25:29,697 --> 00:25:32,867
- What if they really don't work?
- What difference will it make?

311
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,536
The general will be on
the bridge himself by nightfall.

312
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:39,165
He won't have to make contact with
the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?

313
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:44,545
Well, if anyone
rocks the boat...

314
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:46,631
...it's not gonna be me.

315
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:54,639
The regular projector chap's at lunch,
sir. I'll have it in a moment.

316
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:58,351
You're doing splendidly, Fuller.
Don't worry. I don't need lunch.

317
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:02,438
Damn. Nearly there, sir.

318
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:05,608
It's really worth your time, sir.
Believe me.

319
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:08,528
There.

320
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:11,572
Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
Can't see any tanks.

321
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:15,493
Wait a moment, sir.
It's a lot clearer in the next picture.

322
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,495
If I can just...

323
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,623
Now.

324
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,211
- Next.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,588
I've had this one enlarged.

326
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:56,117
I shouldn't worry about them.

327
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:00,747
But, sir, you see
that they are tanks.

328
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:03,374
I doubt if they're
fully serviceable.

329
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,502
- Still got guns.
- So have we.

330
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:10,131
But, sir...

331
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:14,802
...if they weren't serviceable,
why would they try to conceal them?

332
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:17,639
Normal routine, Fuller.

333
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,099
But, sir, we keep getting reports
from the Dutch Underground.

334
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:24,479
I've read them!
And so has Field Marshal Montgomery.

335
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:26,814
Now look here.

336
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,943
There have been thousands of photographs
from this sortie and from the others.

337
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:33,947
- How many of them have shown tanks?
- Just these, sir.

338
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:36,449
And you seriously consider
asking us to cancel...

339
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:39,577
...the biggest operation
mounted since D-Day...

340
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:42,455
...because of three photographs?

341
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:48,336
No, sir.

342
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:51,631
Sixteen consecutive drops have been
cancelled in the last few months...

343
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:54,092
...for one reason or another.

344
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,844
But this time
the party's on...

345
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,180
...and no one is going
to call it off.

346
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,976
Is that fully understood?

347
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,562
Yes, sir.

348
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,253
Thank you, Waddy.

349
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:34,924
Thank you, gentlemen.

350
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:39,178
Do sit down, gentlemen.
Please sit down.

351
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,558
Look after these.

352
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:51,608
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

353
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:58,239
Gentlemen, this is a story
that you will tell your grandchildren...

354
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:00,325
...and mightily bored they'll be.

355
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:05,038
The plan is called
Operation Market Garden.

356
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:08,291
Market is the airborne element,
and Garden the ground forces...

357
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:09,834
That's us.

358
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:14,589
Now this is our position
on the Belgian border here.

359
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:19,177
Tomorrow, three airborne divisions
will begin landing in Holland...

360
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:22,514
Thirty-five thousand men
taking off from 24 airfields...

361
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,433
...in troop-carrying planes
or towed in gliders.

362
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,020
The American 101 st here...

363
00:29:29,187 --> 00:29:31,189
...around Eindhoven...

364
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:33,733
...the American 82nd here...

365
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,944
...south of Nijmegen...

366
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,614
...and our own 1 st Airborne boys
and a Polish brigade...

367
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:41,991
...here at Arnhem...

368
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:44,077
...sixty-four miles...

369
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:46,162
...behind enemy lines.

370
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:52,168
Now, their job
is to take and hold...

371
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:55,296
...all the bridges
in these three areas.

372
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:58,091
Our job is to punch a hole...

373
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:00,885
...through the German
front line here...

374
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:04,472
...and then drive like hell
up this road...

375
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:08,184
...linking up with each
airborne division on the way up.

376
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:13,189
Speed is the vital factor.

377
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:18,069
The plan is to reach Eindhoven
in two to three hours...

378
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:21,114
...and Arnhem in two to three days.

379
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:24,617
That, gentlemen,
is the prize:

380
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:26,786
The bridge over the Rhine...

381
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:30,081
...the last bridge
between us and Germany.

382
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:34,210
Kickoff will be at 1435 hours
tomorrow afternoon.

383
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:37,839
The Irish Guards, under the command of
Colonel Vandeleur, will take the lead.

384
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:40,758
- Christ, not us again.
- What do you say to that, Joe?

385
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:44,137
Delighted, sir.
Truly delighted.

386
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:46,639
I've selected you to lead us...

387
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:49,893
...not only because of your
extraordinary fighting ability...

388
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:51,895
...but also because...

389
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:54,731
...in the unlikely event
that the Germans ever get you...

390
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:58,443
...they'll assume from your attire that
they've captured a wretched peasant...

391
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,029
...and immediately
send you on your way.

392
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:07,452
Now, maintaining
the speed of our advance...

393
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:11,706
...will no doubt be tough going,
as it's a single highway.

394
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:13,374
But no matter what...

395
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:18,213
...we must reach those
1 st Airborne boys in 48 hours.

396
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:20,048
Now, gentlemen...

397
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:22,884
...I'm not saying that this
will be the easiest party...

398
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:25,094
...that we've ever attended...

399
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:27,889
...but I still wouldn't
miss it for the world.

400
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:31,142
I like to think of this...

401
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:34,604
...as one of those
American Western films.

402
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:38,316
The paratroops,
lacking substantial equipment...

403
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,318
...always short of food...

404
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:43,196
These are the
besieged homesteaders.

405
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:46,616
The Germans...
well, naturally they're the bad guys.

406
00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:48,535
And 30 Corps...

407
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:51,913
We, my friends,
are the cavalry...

408
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,707
...on the way to the rescue.

409
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:13,977
Do you want me
to pack that as well, sir?

410
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:17,063
No, thank you, Wicks.
I'll carry it.

411
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,400
You haven't forgotten
my golf clubs, have you?

412
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:23,528
They'll be coming later
in the staff car, sir.

413
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:25,405
And what about...

414
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,407
Sorry, sir?

415
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:29,784
What about my dinner jacket?

416
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,788
Are you sure you'll be
needing that, sir?

417
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:35,874
Well, let's hope so.

418
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,713
Why don't you quit that?

419
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,757
Chock-full of vitamins.

420
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,801
Here, Eddie.
Have a little strength.

421
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:54,100
Hey, where'd you put that?

422
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:57,270
- Damn it, Eddie, give it back.
- Right.

423
00:32:58,438 --> 00:33:00,148
There you are.

424
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:03,485
I wish you hadn't done that.

425
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:09,908
My problem is, I'm not totally crazy
about the prospect of dyin'.

426
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,951
So don't die.

427
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:15,622
Drinkin' that garbage
isn't gonna keep you alive.

428
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:18,124
What is?

429
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,047
- Not gettin' shot.
- And what can guarantee that?

430
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:26,674
Nothin', for sure.

431
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:33,431
- You will.
- I will what?

432
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,268
You tell me, Eddie.
You tell me I won't die.

433
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:40,397
All right, you won't die.

434
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:43,108
No, no. Guarantee me.

435
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:46,152
I want you to guarantee me
I won't die.

436
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:54,786
I guarantee you.

437
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,177
Come on.
Let's get some food in you.

438
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,597
I wasn't kidding.

439
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,856
Hey, Eddie,
were you kidding?

440
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:25,942
Major Fuller.

441
00:34:27,444 --> 00:34:30,989
My name is Sims.
Mind a bit of company?

442
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:34,200
Of course not, sir.

443
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:38,330
Busy times.

444
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,623
You must be exhausted.

445
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:46,254
Are you exhausted?

446
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:48,798
Who isn't?

447
00:34:50,216 --> 00:34:54,095
We've been getting reports
from a number of your friends.

448
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:58,224
They're worried about you.
They think perhaps you need a rest.

449
00:35:00,352 --> 00:35:03,772
We all need rest.
Why are you saying this to me?

450
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,610
Is it because
I rocked the boat?

451
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:14,366
I'm a doctor.
I'm only concerned with your health.

452
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:19,704
I think perhaps you ought
to take a bit of sick leave.

453
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:22,499
But why?

454
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,128
I'm not ill or anything.

455
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:32,050
I haven't done anything wrong.

456
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:35,303
Of course not.
You're just a little tired.

457
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:42,018
I am tired.

458
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:49,359
I think perhaps we might go.

459
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:52,737
Can't it be stopped?

460
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:01,621
I don't want
to be left behind, please.

461
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,000
It's out of my hands, laddie.

462
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:20,390
I didn't want to miss the party.

463
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:58,822
Move it, buddy.
That's the way.

464
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:21,636
Home, sweet home.

465
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:28,560
When you think we only had seven days to
get everything organized, it's quite a...

466
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:30,103
Boody miracle.

467
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,856
It took six months
to set up the D-Day drop...

468
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:35,525
...and that was only
half as big as this.

469
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:38,945
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

470
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:41,489
I'll feel even better
when we're in Holland.

471
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:45,327
Do you remember when I was
appointed to this command...

472
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:49,331
...I told you I had never jumped,
but thought I ought to give it a go?

473
00:38:49,497 --> 00:38:52,459
- Well, you did me a big favor.
- Really? What?

474
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:57,380
You said, "Roy, you're far too old for
that kind of thing, and much too large."

475
00:38:57,547 --> 00:38:59,758
Did I?
What was the favor?

476
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:03,470
Well, I didn't quite tell you
everything at the time...

477
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:07,807
...but I'm prone to airsickness.

478
00:39:08,016 --> 00:39:10,894
Good gracious.
What, every flight?

479
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,481
Well, we'll soon find out,
won't we?

480
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:47,013
Go on! Get that
goddamn jeep outta here!

481
00:41:55,016 --> 00:42:00,063
<i>Who would true valor see</i>

482
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:04,651
<i>Let him come hither</i>

483
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:09,781
<i>One here will constant be</i>

484
00:42:09,948 --> 00:42:14,035
<i>Come wind
Come weather</i>

485
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:19,624
<i>There's no discouragement</i>

486
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,494
Soon be home, Harry.

487
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:06,588
- Better than the desert, eh, sir?
- What was that?

488
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:08,632
Easier than walking, sir.

489
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:13,637
If you say so, Hancock.

490
00:43:27,984 --> 00:43:29,986
Yeah, fine, sir.

491
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:36,535
The artillery should be able to clear
the way very well. Your initial advance.

492
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:39,663
Yes, we'll move off as soon
as their barrage has got going.

493
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,500
- Yes, that's absolutely fine.
- Follow behind it as close as we can.

494
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:45,669
But you know...

495
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:48,922
...this isn't gonna be the pushover
that everybody seems to think it is.

496
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:51,633
No, I didn't think so.

497
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:54,970
Morning, Alan. Your sleeping beauties
know there's a war on, do they?

498
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:56,304
Absolutely, sir.

499
00:43:56,513 --> 00:43:59,558
Is it true that the Germans have put
more troops into the line ahead of us?

500
00:43:59,725 --> 00:44:03,145
Yes. They obviously don't intend
to just let us walk in the front door.

501
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:06,773
Hello, Bob! Hope that's not
my funeral they're going to.

502
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:09,860
And I'm still
desperately worried...

503
00:44:10,027 --> 00:44:12,070
...about having them throw
everything up this road.

504
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:15,198
But there's no alternative.
Morning, Tom.

505
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:18,160
So I've decided to run
the road like a railway.

506
00:44:18,326 --> 00:44:20,537
Nobody, repeat,
nobody will be allowed...

507
00:44:20,704 --> 00:44:23,665
...to put any vehicle on that road
without my permission.

508
00:44:23,832 --> 00:44:25,667
- Including me?
- Good luck to you!

509
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:29,546
You too!
Especially you, Joe.

510
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:31,298
Morning, Derek!

511
00:44:31,465 --> 00:44:33,925
Glad to see somebody
knows where we're going.

512
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:42,768
Time, Joe.
That's the killer.

513
00:44:42,934 --> 00:44:45,520
We can't afford
to drop behind schedule.

514
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,692
So for God's sake,
keep your tanks on the move.

515
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,745
Good God Almighty.

516
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,414
That's just the 101 st.

517
00:45:04,581 --> 00:45:07,501
The other two groups
are on the northern route.

518
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:10,921
H hour in 90 minutes.

519
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:13,590
- I'd better be going, sir.
- Right you are, Joe.

520
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:17,052
- Any last-minute changes, Bob?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:20,472
If the advance runs into difficulty, we
call in the Air Force with purple smoke.

522
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,392
First class.
And good luck, Joe!

523
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:25,102
Thank you, sir.

524
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:26,812
Think you'll be able
to manage it?

525
00:45:26,979 --> 00:45:30,399
I've got nothing else planned
for this afternoon.

526
00:46:38,383 --> 00:46:41,303
I told you you should have had
the bloody thing out.

527
00:46:58,445 --> 00:47:00,447
What the hell's that?

528
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:02,532
It's flak.

529
00:47:09,164 --> 00:47:10,707
General Bittrich!

530
00:47:10,874 --> 00:47:12,876
In here, Matthias.

531
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:29,726
Fantastic, isn't it?

532
00:47:29,893 --> 00:47:33,730
Just once to have
such power in my hands.

533
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,699
Red on.

534
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:18,228
Come on, move yourselves!

535
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:28,697
If there's no more opposition than this
on the road, we should be all right.

536
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:31,992
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

537
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:47,716
B Company, to me!

538
00:50:47,883 --> 00:50:50,594
A Company, over there!

539
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,990
Excuse the interruption,
Field Marshal, but...

540
00:51:12,157 --> 00:51:14,660
...British paratroopers
have landed...

541
00:51:15,536 --> 00:51:18,413
...three kilometers from here.

542
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,083
Why should they do that?

543
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:24,586
There is nothing
important here.

544
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:30,843
Me! I am important.

545
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:33,929
They must all be coming
just to capture me.

546
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:35,806
Call my chauffeur and car.

547
00:51:36,765 --> 00:51:39,393
Evacuate the headquarters.

548
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,228
And don't forget my cigars.

549
00:52:19,975 --> 00:52:21,018
General!

550
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:23,812
- You all right?
- Yeah.

551
00:52:57,137 --> 00:53:00,391
Okay, you guys,
gather your stuff and move!

552
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:14,905
- This is it, Jim.
- Okay, sir.

553
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:21,120
You okay?

554
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:23,205
Right! Let's go!

555
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:28,460
Then keep trying.

556
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:30,879
There must be someone there!

557
00:53:33,382 --> 00:53:36,468
My apologies.
I can get no sense from anybody.

558
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:39,138
They say thousands of troops
are dropping over Holland.

559
00:53:39,304 --> 00:53:42,641
- Yes, west of Arnhem.
- Right on top of Field Marshal Model.

560
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:45,853
I can't get through
to his headquarters.

561
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,064
A strong force has landed
south of Nijmegen.

562
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:52,484
Nijmegen?
They're after the bridge.

563
00:53:55,112 --> 00:53:58,824
That doesn't matter.

564
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:01,118
Perhaps they've landed
in the Field Marshal's soup.

565
00:54:02,494 --> 00:54:06,331
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Now listen.

566
00:54:06,498 --> 00:54:08,542
I'll take care of Arnhem.

567
00:54:08,709 --> 00:54:12,087
You get to Nijmegen
as fast as you can.

568
00:54:12,254 --> 00:54:13,505
Take anything that'll move...

569
00:54:13,714 --> 00:54:17,468
...every man that can walk,
and hold the bridge.

570
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:22,348
No. Field Marshal Model.

571
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:27,519
Nothing must cross it.
Is that clear?

572
00:54:27,686 --> 00:54:30,647
You must hold that bridge
under any circumstances.

573
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:33,525
- Understood?
- Clear.

574
00:54:33,817 --> 00:54:35,694
Ryan and Ross,
come with me.

575
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,656
Cover the right flank.

576
00:54:44,912 --> 00:54:46,789
How far away is headquarters?

577
00:54:46,955 --> 00:54:48,999
Half a mile.
Maybe more.

578
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:16,360
Brigadier Lathbury's
just left, sir.

579
00:55:16,568 --> 00:55:18,904
Johnny Frost and the 2nd Battalion
are on the river road.

580
00:55:19,071 --> 00:55:20,406
Good.

581
00:55:20,572 --> 00:55:23,534
Thank you, Baker. Any news of
Freddie Gough's jeep squadron?

582
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:25,786
- It's unconfirmed...
- It's rather bad luck, sir.

583
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:28,706
Considering how few gliders
we lost on the way in.

584
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:33,877
It appears that a lot of
the special jeeps failed to arrive...

585
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:36,505
...and those that did have been
badly shot up in an ambush.

586
00:55:36,672 --> 00:55:40,050
So no one's going to get
to Arnhem Bridge except on foot.

587
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:41,093
Splendid.

588
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:51,770
They must be from the lunatic asylum,
located on the far side of the wood.

589
00:55:52,688 --> 00:55:54,648
They escaped when
it was bombed this morning.

590
00:56:01,363 --> 00:56:03,782
Do you think they know
something we don't?

591
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:20,758
All guns, commence firing!

592
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:35,689
Right, get moving.
Get moving.

593
00:56:35,856 --> 00:56:37,316
Driver, advance.

594
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,888
Start the purple!

595
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:56,390
Start the purple!

596
00:59:56,557 --> 00:59:58,642
Take cover!

597
01:00:12,072 --> 01:00:14,533
- Loading!
- Fire!

598
01:01:56,927 --> 01:01:59,346
Get the wounded down the line.

599
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:05,519
Get that wreck off the road.

600
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:14,278
Joe, how the hell...

601
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:19,784
How the hell do they expect us
to keep to schedule on a road like this?

602
01:02:19,992 --> 01:02:22,161
You don't know the worst.

603
01:02:22,328 --> 01:02:24,914
- This bit we're on now...
- Yes?

604
01:02:26,665 --> 01:02:28,000
It's the wide part.

605
01:03:37,903 --> 01:03:40,823
Peter, the general's coming in.

606
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:43,325
- How's it going now?
- Not too well, sir.

607
01:03:43,534 --> 01:03:45,953
We haven't been able to make contact
with General Browning...

608
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,039
...30 Corps or England.

609
01:03:49,415 --> 01:03:51,375
So no one knows
we've arrived safely.

610
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:53,669
Not as far as we know, sir.

611
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,213
What about those VHF sets?

612
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:00,092
Well, sir, it appears the sets have
been delivered with the wrong crystals.

613
01:04:01,552 --> 01:04:04,680
- So they're quite useless?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid they are.

614
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:10,561
Are Brigadier Lathbury and Colonel Frost
aware of what happened...

615
01:04:10,728 --> 01:04:13,189
...to the special jeep squadron?
- Not as far as we know.

616
01:04:13,356 --> 01:04:16,817
At the moment we're unable to contact
any of the units moving into Arnhem.

617
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,572
Not a very satisfactory
state of affairs.

618
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:26,577
We can't quite understand it.
It's perfectly good equipment.

619
01:04:26,744 --> 01:04:28,829
Then for God's sake,
get it sorted out...

620
01:04:29,038 --> 01:04:31,916
...before we have a bloody disaster
on our hands.

621
01:04:43,177 --> 01:04:44,595
Sir.

622
01:04:47,515 --> 01:04:49,392
Hancock...

623
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:52,144
...I've got lunatics
laughing at me from the woods.

624
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:56,273
My original plan has been scuppered
now that the jeeps haven't arrived.

625
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,110
My communications
have completely broken down.

626
01:05:00,653 --> 01:05:03,155
Do you really believe
that any of that can be helped...

627
01:05:03,322 --> 01:05:05,241
...by a cup of tea?

628
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:08,828
Couldn't hurt, sir.

629
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:26,178
Forgive me for returning,
Field Marshal.

630
01:05:26,345 --> 01:05:28,055
I must press for permission...

631
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:30,599
...if it becomes necessary...

632
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:35,855
...to blow up the bridges
at Arnhem and Nijmegen.

633
01:05:36,022 --> 01:05:37,690
That is out of the question.

634
01:05:37,857 --> 01:05:40,192
Never.
Is that clear?

635
01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:42,194
We need them
for our counterattack.

636
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:44,989
Counterattack?
With what?

637
01:05:45,156 --> 01:05:48,034
Paratroopers cannot fight long.
They are too lightly equipped.

638
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,202
Isolated they are lost.

639
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:52,913
I have spoken
to Von Rundstedt.

640
01:05:53,122 --> 01:05:56,542
All reinforcements
come to us first.

641
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:59,795
Every hour we get stronger
and they grow weaker.

642
01:05:59,962 --> 01:06:04,425
- But if we blow the bridges...
- They don't want the bridges.

643
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:06,677
Do you really think
if they wanted the bridges...

644
01:06:06,844 --> 01:06:10,765
...they would have landed
12 kilometers away?

645
01:06:10,932 --> 01:06:12,808
It's ridiculous.

646
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:19,106
Thank you for the tea.

647
01:07:10,283 --> 01:07:12,368
Our lightning-like assault
on Arnhem Bridge...

648
01:07:12,535 --> 01:07:14,954
...is certainly a smashing success.

649
01:07:16,247 --> 01:07:19,083
I've an aversion to apples.
I'm so sorry.

650
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,794
I'm sure the Germans will
be thunderstruck with surprise.

651
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:24,880
- Are there many of you?
- Yes, there are thousands of us.

652
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:28,426
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

653
01:07:28,634 --> 01:07:30,970
Look here, this isn't
a victory parade.

654
01:07:31,178 --> 01:07:33,472
Come on, sir,
enjoy the moment.

655
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:35,474
I will enjoy the moment
when we reach the bridge...

656
01:07:35,641 --> 01:07:37,476
...and when we find the bridge intact.

657
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:39,979
It will be.
Things couldn't be going better.

658
01:07:40,146 --> 01:07:43,900
- Nothing's wrong.
- I know. That's exactly what is wrong.

659
01:08:37,495 --> 01:08:39,497
Jesus Christ!

660
01:09:00,518 --> 01:09:02,436
Stay down!

661
01:09:19,912 --> 01:09:21,706
Shit.

662
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:26,878
There's still no contact.

663
01:09:27,044 --> 01:09:29,172
Then keep at it.
I shall be back shortly.

664
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:31,841
Brigadier Lathbury can't have gone
that far. All right, Brown.

665
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:35,011
I'm sure we'll have them fixed
by the time you get back, sir.

666
01:09:41,434 --> 01:09:44,812
Can you get a message down
to 30th Corps on that dingus?

667
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:48,107
Yes, sir. We just got word
from the 82nd up ahead.

668
01:09:48,274 --> 01:09:50,568
They've captured the Grave Bridge
completely intact.

669
01:09:50,735 --> 01:09:52,653
That's terrific,
except 30th Corps...

670
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:55,490
...ain't about to reach
the goddamn intact Grave Bridge...

671
01:09:55,656 --> 01:09:58,618
...until the goddamn Son Bridge
gets fixed.

672
01:09:58,784 --> 01:10:00,912
Tell our British cousins
to hustle up some Bailey stuff.

673
01:10:01,746 --> 01:10:03,623
I'll meet 'em in Eindhoven
when they get there.

674
01:10:03,789 --> 01:10:07,460
Tell those schmucks to do this right and
have their Bailey stuff at the front.

675
01:10:07,627 --> 01:10:08,753
Got that?

676
01:10:09,754 --> 01:10:12,048
And be sure to say please.

677
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:25,394
Joe, I make it just over six miles
to Eindhoven.

678
01:10:25,603 --> 01:10:29,232
We won't make it tonight.
It'll be dark shortly.

679
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,319
Well, I hope to God the 101 st
can hang on till tomorrow.

680
01:10:33,486 --> 01:10:38,908
Giles, remember what the general said:
"We're the cavalry."

681
01:10:39,117 --> 01:10:42,745
It would be bad form
to arrive in advance of schedule.

682
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:47,083
In the nick of time
would do nicely.

683
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:52,463
These plans should have
been left in England.

684
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:53,840
They're top secret.

685
01:10:54,006 --> 01:10:56,509
And now we have all we need...

686
01:10:56,676 --> 01:11:00,596
Units, defense plans,
objectives...

687
01:11:00,763 --> 01:11:03,224
...and the schedule
for further drops.

688
01:11:03,391 --> 01:11:05,768
I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge
for demolition...

689
01:11:05,935 --> 01:11:08,396
...if I blow it up tonight.

690
01:11:08,563 --> 01:11:11,691
This Operation Market Garden
must fail.

691
01:11:11,858 --> 01:11:16,946
Why do all my generals
want to destroy my bridges?

692
01:11:17,113 --> 01:11:19,824
Come, Ludwig.
We'll have dinner.

693
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:22,827
Dinner?

694
01:11:22,994 --> 01:11:24,829
But what about these plans?

695
01:11:24,996 --> 01:11:27,498
These plans?
They are false.

696
01:11:28,499 --> 01:11:31,002
Just a trick.
We were supposed to find them.

697
01:11:31,169 --> 01:11:33,087
White wine or red?

698
01:11:39,135 --> 01:11:42,764
We're still getting nothing from Colonel
Frost's battalion on the river road.

699
01:11:42,972 --> 01:11:46,017
- Thank you, Cole.
- Dog-Charlie-Fox. Over.

700
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:48,436
Let's hope Johnny's meeting
less resistance than we are.

701
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:51,606
- We must break through to the bridge.
- We're completely blocked ahead of us.

702
01:11:51,814 --> 01:11:54,150
There's a good deal more resistance
than we've been led to expect.

703
01:11:54,317 --> 01:11:57,403
I must see for myself how he's doing.
All right, Cole.

704
01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:59,572
- What is their strength?
- I can't estimate yet.

705
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:02,867
Some Dutch Underground people were here
earlier trying to explain the situation.

706
01:12:03,034 --> 01:12:04,827
I'm not sure how much they know.

707
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:22,637
Stretcher bearer, bring that stretcher
over here to these men!

708
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:24,764
- What about Brown?
- They've both had it.

709
01:12:27,016 --> 01:12:29,394
Christ Almighty!
They've gone round behind us.

710
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,105
I think it might be safer
if you spent the night with us.

711
01:12:32,313 --> 01:12:35,817
- I've got to get back to H.Q.
- Yes, but alive, sir.

712
01:12:36,025 --> 01:12:39,112
If we can reach them,
there are some houses in that direction.

713
01:12:39,278 --> 01:12:42,782
We can get ourselves organized
and try and find out what's happening.

714
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:44,826
Pull him out!

715
01:12:44,992 --> 01:12:46,828
- Right.
- Sergeant Major.

716
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:46,763
Come on, lads.
Get a move on.

717
01:13:46,929 --> 01:13:48,848
- Something just occurred to me.
- What's that, sir?

718
01:13:49,015 --> 01:13:50,683
We're wearing the wrong camouflage.

719
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:54,479
It's all very well for the country,
but we won't fool anyone in the towns.

720
01:13:56,147 --> 01:13:58,066
Come on.

721
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:06,866
I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid we're
going to have to occupy your house.

722
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:11,871
- All right, chaps, we're in here.
- The house on the other side.

723
01:14:12,038 --> 01:14:14,165
- Section Two, over here.
- Dick.

724
01:14:14,374 --> 01:14:17,335
Now, take your men,
occupy that house across the road.

725
01:14:17,502 --> 01:14:19,545
Make sure you can cover the bridge
from your side.

726
01:14:19,712 --> 01:14:20,713
Sergeant, follow me.

727
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,925
Hello, Dog-Charlie-Fox.

728
01:14:28,012 --> 01:14:31,724
Rip down those curtains,
pile this furniture against the window.

729
01:14:34,977 --> 01:14:38,523
We've reached our objective.
What is your position? Over.

730
01:14:40,358 --> 01:14:41,359
There's nothing.

731
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:44,445
I can't contact Brigade
at all, sir.

732
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:46,572
Tried the other battalions?

733
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:49,242
Any luck?

734
01:14:49,409 --> 01:14:51,452
Keep trying.

735
01:14:53,746 --> 01:14:55,707
- Order them out.
- Please, Mother.

736
01:14:55,873 --> 01:14:58,251
- This is my house.
- Perhaps by tomorrow.

737
01:14:58,418 --> 01:15:00,086
Tomorrow?

738
01:15:00,253 --> 01:15:02,171
Yes, Mother.

739
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:24,444
Shall we have a go
at the far end now, sir?

740
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,864
"Having a go" is hardly
textbook terminology, Harry.

741
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:32,619
But you'll let us try, sir?

742
01:16:31,135 --> 01:16:32,762
Down! Take cover!

743
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:34,722
Cover fire! Quick!

744
01:16:39,143 --> 01:16:40,103
Smoke!

745
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:49,195
Come on, lads!

746
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,580
Come on. Keep going.

747
01:17:00,456 --> 01:17:02,375
Give us a hand.

748
01:17:08,881 --> 01:17:10,800
Fall back!

749
01:17:14,846 --> 01:17:16,890
Hurry.

750
01:17:33,197 --> 01:17:35,825
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

751
01:17:35,992 --> 01:17:38,328
We'll deal with them later...

752
01:17:38,494 --> 01:17:40,371
...when it gets dark.

753
01:18:00,683 --> 01:18:03,478
- Made it so far, Doddsie?
- Aye.

754
01:18:19,035 --> 01:18:21,496
Better hit that slit first time.

755
01:18:22,539 --> 01:18:26,626
Hey, Corp, I said you'd better
hit that slit first time or...

756
01:18:26,793 --> 01:18:28,253
I heard you, boyo.

757
01:18:28,419 --> 01:18:30,338
Oh, great.

758
01:18:31,381 --> 01:18:33,341
After you, Corp.

759
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:53,695
Come on.
Let's get on with it.

760
01:19:01,744 --> 01:19:03,037
Now!

761
01:19:04,956 --> 01:19:07,083
Now we're in trouble.
You bloody missed it!

762
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,419
You knocked my arm,
you clumsy bastard.

763
01:19:09,586 --> 01:19:11,963
Now we'll never get out of here.

764
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:19,179
We've hit an ammunition dump,
a bloody ammo dump. Shit!

765
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:52,337
Fool's courage.

766
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:26,830
She says you are much too noisy.

767
01:20:26,996 --> 01:20:29,916
She does realize there is something
of a war going on, doesn't she?

768
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:33,545
She has never liked noise.
She hates it.

769
01:20:34,879 --> 01:20:35,880
They're coming.

770
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:37,423
Excuse me.

771
01:20:41,427 --> 01:20:42,595
Many of them?

772
01:20:42,762 --> 01:20:46,391
Can't tell, sir.
We can only hear them at the moment.

773
01:21:48,995 --> 01:21:50,705
Hold your fire!

774
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:52,290
Hold your fire!

775
01:21:58,630 --> 01:21:59,589
Fire!

776
01:22:04,969 --> 01:22:07,430
Command. Wait for the command.

777
01:22:15,939 --> 01:22:18,983
Over there with it.
Look after that man.

778
01:22:19,192 --> 01:22:22,487
Open fire! Fire!

779
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:06,239
Keep firing. Come on.

780
01:24:24,317 --> 01:24:26,236
Cease firing.

781
01:24:42,085 --> 01:24:43,878
Sorry, ma'am.

782
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:48,341
Try and rustle up
some more bandages, will you?

783
01:24:49,759 --> 01:24:51,928
Lad, you'll be all right.
See you later.

784
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:56,558
Get him patched up, Doc.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

785
01:24:58,143 --> 01:25:00,103
- Wicks.
- Sir.

786
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:04,024
Right, off you go.

787
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:18,246
Get that bloody stretcher inside!

788
01:25:20,707 --> 01:25:22,417
All right. Here we go.

789
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,968
Good morning. Mr. Cornish
is straight through there.

790
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:34,054
Right. Thank you.

791
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:38,767
Hello, Dick.
It's all right. Sit down.

792
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:42,145
- You all right?
- Fine. It's only a flesh wound.

793
01:25:42,312 --> 01:25:44,773
- How are things?
- Not too bad, sir.

794
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:48,526
What is bad is this.

795
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:49,945
- Careful.
- Sorry.

796
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:53,573
We hold the north end of the bridge.
The Germans hold the south.

797
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,117
But now they probably control
most of the town...

798
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:58,203
...including the church tower.

799
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,205
What you're saying is
that we're surrounded.

800
01:26:00,372 --> 01:26:02,791
Yes, something like that.

801
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,626
- What else?
- Sir.

802
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:08,922
I was a bit surprised to find
Bittrich's panzer troops here, sir.

803
01:26:17,264 --> 01:26:20,809
Yes, well, surely you didn't believe
all that nonsense they told us.

804
01:26:20,976 --> 01:26:25,105
I mean, about the enemy being
made up of old men, children.

805
01:26:27,857 --> 01:26:29,276
We'll have to risk it.

806
01:26:29,442 --> 01:26:31,611
It's halfway through the morning,
and things aren't getting any better.

807
01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:34,072
- Sergeant, how is it?
- Sir.

808
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,740
We can't clear the streets.

809
01:26:35,907 --> 01:26:39,119
Enemy strength keeps increasing. It's
impossible to get through to the bridge.

810
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:40,954
Thanks, Sergeant.

811
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:44,791
It's imperative I get back to H.Q.
before the situation gets out of hand.

812
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,627
If it's all right with you, Cleminson
and I will come part of the way.

813
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:49,963
- All right, Jimmy?
- Let's move.

814
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:40,138
End house,
bottom window, sir.

815
01:27:44,476 --> 01:27:45,727
Cleminson, get over here.

816
01:27:48,855 --> 01:27:51,191
Hang on, Gerald.

817
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:56,363
In here. Come on.

818
01:27:59,533 --> 01:28:01,368
Can't you move your legs?

819
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:06,456
Must be the spine.
Can you help us?

820
01:28:06,623 --> 01:28:09,167
- How?
- Don't you know a doctor nearby?

821
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:11,294
We can take him to the hospital.

822
01:28:16,508 --> 01:28:18,969
You go. He will be fine.

823
01:28:19,177 --> 01:28:20,554
Go, sir.

824
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,763
You go.

825
01:28:55,755 --> 01:28:57,215
Go up.

826
01:29:20,322 --> 01:29:23,742
They're certainly at the back.
What's it like at the front?

827
01:29:30,373 --> 01:29:31,625
We're surrounded.

828
01:29:33,502 --> 01:29:34,920
Yes. Quite.

829
01:29:41,718 --> 01:29:44,471
I was rather expecting to see you
again, General Sosabowski.

830
01:29:44,638 --> 01:29:46,556
Do please sit down.

831
01:29:50,393 --> 01:29:53,730
The Polish drop has been cancelled
again. I would like an explanation.

832
01:29:53,897 --> 01:29:57,067
Well, I expect the fog has
a certain amount to do with it.

833
01:29:57,275 --> 01:29:59,861
I'm told there are aircraft flying
50 miles to the south.

834
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:02,739
Explain to me why my men and equipment
cannot be moved from here to there...

835
01:30:02,906 --> 01:30:04,199
...and then fly to Arnhem.

836
01:30:05,242 --> 01:30:07,285
That's a very reasonable question.

837
01:30:07,452 --> 01:30:11,373
I don't want to bother you with
a lot of meteorological mumbo jumbo...

838
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,959
...but the fact is, you see,
whether we like it or not...

839
01:30:14,126 --> 01:30:16,628
...fog... it moves.

840
01:30:16,795 --> 01:30:19,089
Of course it moves. Where?

841
01:30:19,297 --> 01:30:21,299
That's very difficult
to say, General.

842
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:24,094
It's very slippery stuff, fog.

843
01:30:24,261 --> 01:30:27,180
You think you've got it,
then it reverses itself...

844
01:30:27,347 --> 01:30:29,766
...and leaves you behind.

845
01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:33,061
Won't you please sit down?

846
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:35,397
What I'm trying to say, General...

847
01:30:35,605 --> 01:30:37,732
...is even if we move your troops
the 50 miles...

848
01:30:37,941 --> 01:30:40,193
I grant you,
now the sun is shining...

849
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,362
...the chances are that
by the time we get there...

850
01:30:42,529 --> 01:30:45,490
...the fog could quite easily
have preceded us.

851
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:48,994
- So we simply have to wait.
- And do nothing.

852
01:30:49,161 --> 01:30:51,329
I think that puts it rather well.

853
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:38,794
Hey, you! You Vandeleur?

854
01:31:40,003 --> 01:31:41,755
- Yeah.
- I'm Bobby Stout.

855
01:31:41,922 --> 01:31:43,173
How do you do?

856
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,842
Hell of a day, huh?
Look at 'em... wild.

857
01:31:46,009 --> 01:31:47,511
Have you ever been liberated?

858
01:31:47,677 --> 01:31:50,514
- I got divorced twice. Does that count?
- Yes, that counts.

859
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,183
Hey, that Bailey crap.
You got it amongst this stuff?

860
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:55,519
When you refer to Bailey crap...

861
01:31:55,685 --> 01:31:59,606
...I take it you mean that glorious
precision-made British-built bridge...

862
01:31:59,773 --> 01:32:01,733
...which is the envy
of the civilized world.

863
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:04,820
- Yeah.
- The trucks are down there somewhere.

864
01:32:05,028 --> 01:32:07,489
But how you're going to get them
through this crowd, I don't know.

865
01:32:07,656 --> 01:32:10,909
No problem. I got a side road
pegged out that'll avoid all this.

866
01:32:11,076 --> 01:32:13,495
- American ingenuity.
- Oh, really?

867
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:16,623
Actually I was born in Yugoslavia,
but what the hell.

868
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:18,166
Yes.

869
01:32:32,139 --> 01:32:34,141
Okay, I'll take it, sir.

870
01:32:38,937 --> 01:32:41,440
- Where the hell have you been?
- With some Dutch friends at Nijmegen.

871
01:32:41,606 --> 01:32:44,317
Look. This is why
we can't take the bridge.

872
01:32:44,484 --> 01:32:46,361
The Germans have moved in
S.S. panzer troops.

873
01:32:46,528 --> 01:32:48,321
You'd think they didn't want us
to get across or something.

874
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,282
They've sealed off the whole area.

875
01:32:50,449 --> 01:32:53,493
Here. You can see on this map.

876
01:32:54,536 --> 01:32:56,872
Every street leading to the bridge
is blocked.

877
01:32:57,039 --> 01:32:58,999
Every house around it is occupied.

878
01:32:59,166 --> 01:33:02,544
The Dutch Underground people say
it's just impossible to break through.

879
01:33:03,795 --> 01:33:05,714
They could be right.

880
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:12,888
- Where's the captain?
- Dead.

881
01:33:14,681 --> 01:33:16,850
I didn't ask you how he was.
I asked you where he was.

882
01:37:50,207 --> 01:37:53,418
Orderly, we're all out
of bandages over here.

883
01:38:26,076 --> 01:38:27,703
- Sir.
- Not now.

884
01:38:27,911 --> 01:38:29,997
- I'd like you to look at my captain.
- I'm sorry. Put him down.

885
01:38:42,426 --> 01:38:46,180
What in the name of hell
do you...

886
01:38:46,346 --> 01:38:50,350
- You told me to put him down.
- I'm in no mood for crapping around.

887
01:38:51,685 --> 01:38:53,937
If you don't look at him right now,
he's going to die.

888
01:38:54,104 --> 01:38:56,023
He's dead now.

889
01:38:58,275 --> 01:39:00,235
It'd mean a lot to me
if you'd check him out.

890
01:39:00,402 --> 01:39:03,572
Come on, Sergeant.
For Christ's sake, get him out of here.

891
01:39:10,913 --> 01:39:13,373
Would you look at him,
please, sir...

892
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:17,711
...right now...

893
01:39:17,878 --> 01:39:20,923
...or I'll blow
your fuckin' head off.

894
01:39:26,803 --> 01:39:28,263
Right now.

895
01:39:35,062 --> 01:39:37,105
I can give him a quick examination,
if you like.

896
01:39:37,272 --> 01:39:39,399
Thank you very much, sir.

897
01:39:51,787 --> 01:39:54,414
Son of a bitch.

898
01:39:54,581 --> 01:39:56,125
Orderly!

899
01:40:54,933 --> 01:40:57,936
Well, I got the bullet
out of his skull.

900
01:40:58,145 --> 01:41:01,273
- He's gonna live though, right?
- He's gonna have one hell of a headache.

901
01:41:08,655 --> 01:41:11,283
Guess you can turn me in now, sir.

902
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:14,119
That was a court-martial offense.
You understand that?

903
01:41:14,286 --> 01:41:17,247
- Yes, sir.
- Hope to hell it was worth it.

904
01:41:18,999 --> 01:41:21,585
Guess only time
will tell on that, sir.

905
01:41:21,752 --> 01:41:24,463
My response is strictly limited,
regardless of my personal preference.

906
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:26,423
- You understand that too?
- I do.

907
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:27,758
Like somebody cheating in school.

908
01:41:27,925 --> 01:41:31,095
Once word gets out that you can behave
any way you goddamn please...

909
01:41:31,261 --> 01:41:33,639
...discipline's gone,
forget about getting it back.

910
01:41:33,806 --> 01:41:36,892
So you're gonna have to be arrested,
over and out. Lieutenant Rafferty.

911
01:41:37,059 --> 01:41:38,769
Yes, sir, Colonel.

912
01:41:38,936 --> 01:41:42,022
Lieutenant Rafferty,
this is Sergeant... What's your name?

913
01:41:42,189 --> 01:41:43,857
Eddie Dohun.

914
01:41:44,024 --> 01:41:46,193
Sergeant Dohun pulled a gun on me
and threatened to kill me...

915
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,695
...unless I did precisely
what he ordered.

916
01:41:48,862 --> 01:41:50,697
- I want you to put him under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

917
01:41:50,864 --> 01:41:54,618
I want you to keep him there
for at least ten seconds.

918
01:41:55,994 --> 01:41:59,790
- I'm not all that sure I understand.
- Count to ten, Lieutenant, fast.

919
01:42:01,375 --> 01:42:03,752
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten. Like that?

920
01:42:03,919 --> 01:42:06,422
Thank you, Lieutenant.

921
01:42:10,175 --> 01:42:12,386
This is yours, I think.

922
01:42:13,512 --> 01:42:15,472
It sure looks like mine.

923
01:42:19,309 --> 01:42:22,187
You scared the shit out of me,
you stupid bastard.

924
01:42:22,354 --> 01:42:24,690
You did a fine job yourself,
if it makes you feel any better.

925
01:42:24,857 --> 01:42:26,859
Goddamn right it does.

926
01:42:27,025 --> 01:42:29,528
- Eddie?
- Sir.

927
01:42:29,695 --> 01:42:32,740
You wouldn't really
have killed me, would you?

928
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:40,289
Thank you, sir.

929
01:42:56,722 --> 01:43:00,017
Right!
Let's haul a little ass! Go!

930
01:43:13,238 --> 01:43:16,200
Hold! Hold!

931
01:43:29,213 --> 01:43:32,466
Move it. Come on, soldier,
you're not building a sand castle.

932
01:43:51,026 --> 01:43:53,654
Come on, boys.
Use your muscle.

933
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:55,739
Heave.

934
01:43:55,906 --> 01:43:57,783
Come on, heave!

935
01:43:58,993 --> 01:44:01,745
Unload quickly.

936
01:44:01,912 --> 01:44:05,082
- It's all right, sir.
- Come on, move yourself.

937
01:44:07,251 --> 01:44:09,211
We haven't got all day.

938
01:44:15,092 --> 01:44:16,927
Come on, push!

939
01:44:35,988 --> 01:44:38,324
Altogether, lift!

940
01:44:41,035 --> 01:44:45,372
Come on, soldier, pound it.
We've got a schedule to meet.

941
01:45:04,933 --> 01:45:07,102
Steady.

942
01:45:15,361 --> 01:45:16,779
Hold it.

943
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:22,910
- How much longer now?
- About another four hours, sir.

944
01:45:24,078 --> 01:45:25,162
Shit.

945
01:45:25,955 --> 01:45:29,583
Come on, boys.
We're not doing this for fun.

946
01:46:00,155 --> 01:46:02,533
- Hey, soldier, get over here.
- Yes, sir.

947
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:04,868
- Pull on this rope.
- Yes, sir.

948
01:46:05,035 --> 01:46:08,289
Didn't you ever build
a Bailey bridge before?

949
01:46:09,456 --> 01:46:11,875
Neither did I.

950
01:46:23,012 --> 01:46:25,723
Clear the way! Clear!

951
01:46:30,185 --> 01:46:32,104
We haven't got all day.

952
01:46:32,271 --> 01:46:34,565
Roll it, fellas!

953
01:46:34,732 --> 01:46:37,526
Right. Come on. All aboard.
Let's get moving again.

954
01:47:04,011 --> 01:47:06,263
- Thanks, fellas.
- Be seeing you.

955
01:47:12,561 --> 01:47:16,523
- What's wrong, sir?
- They're 36 hours behind schedule.

956
01:47:35,459 --> 01:47:37,002
Lieutenant.

957
01:47:37,169 --> 01:47:38,879
Sir.

958
01:47:39,046 --> 01:47:42,508
We'll be turning you over
to the 82nd now.

959
01:47:42,675 --> 01:47:45,010
They're good soldiers, the 82nd.

960
01:47:45,177 --> 01:47:47,721
Just be sure you keep your hand
on your wallet at all times.

961
01:47:47,888 --> 01:47:49,139
Yes, sir.

962
01:48:39,231 --> 01:48:41,192
They're here.

963
01:48:45,237 --> 01:48:47,990
It's 30 Corps.
They're here, chaps.

964
01:48:54,246 --> 01:48:58,083
You're late, you lazy bastard,
but we'll forgive you!

965
01:48:59,293 --> 01:49:00,878
That was gracious of me.

966
01:49:03,255 --> 01:49:06,592
Take cover!
Bring up the Piat.

967
01:49:07,676 --> 01:49:10,387
Make sure it's within range.

968
01:49:53,806 --> 01:49:56,642
Come on! You'll miss him.

969
01:50:25,754 --> 01:50:28,257
Right, lads! Go, go!

970
01:50:40,311 --> 01:50:41,812
Corporal!

971
01:50:41,979 --> 01:50:43,856
I need a jeep.
Well done, laddie.

972
01:50:44,023 --> 01:50:47,568
- We thought you were dead.
- I can assure you it was an error.

973
01:51:05,753 --> 01:51:07,463
That was the bleeding general.

974
01:51:08,672 --> 01:51:11,717
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

975
01:51:11,884 --> 01:51:14,345
Carry on, thank you.
Good morning, Baker.

976
01:51:14,512 --> 01:51:16,388
Good morning, James.

977
01:51:18,516 --> 01:51:23,062
Harry. Apologies for
my enforced absence. Dennis.

978
01:51:23,229 --> 01:51:25,189
- Sir.
- Lathbury's been put out of action.

979
01:51:25,356 --> 01:51:27,733
I'd like you to go into town,
take over the brigade.

980
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:29,944
- How soon can you leave?
- Right away.

981
01:51:30,152 --> 01:51:32,488
Pull them together and keep
pushing forward to the bridge.

982
01:51:32,696 --> 01:51:34,448
Did the rest of the division
arrive safely?

983
01:51:34,615 --> 01:51:36,617
Yes, but we've run into
all kinds of trouble.

984
01:51:36,784 --> 01:51:39,995
It would seem that we've landed
on top of two S.S. panzer divisions.

985
01:51:40,162 --> 01:51:41,122
Good God.

986
01:51:41,330 --> 01:51:43,290
As you can imagine,
it's hard to stop tanks...

987
01:51:43,457 --> 01:51:46,127
...with rifles and machine guns.
- Show me.

988
01:51:47,002 --> 01:51:48,921
You can see what we're up against.

989
01:51:49,088 --> 01:51:51,757
Johnny Frost and some of his chaps have
managed to get as far as the bridge.

990
01:51:51,924 --> 01:51:54,385
But the Germans are driving
down here towards the river...

991
01:51:54,552 --> 01:51:57,930
...and may even now
have cut them off completely.

992
01:51:58,097 --> 01:52:02,309
Now the entire division is here, we
should be able to break through to him.

993
01:52:02,476 --> 01:52:05,020
It certainly gives us
more of a chance.

994
01:52:05,187 --> 01:52:07,523
Sosabowski's Polish brigade
is due in at 12:00.

995
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:08,774
If it arrives.

996
01:52:08,941 --> 01:52:11,694
Yesterday's airlift was three hours late
due to fog in England.

997
01:52:11,861 --> 01:52:14,530
The gliders bringing the Poles'
equipment didn't arrive at all.

998
01:52:14,697 --> 01:52:18,159
- Now give me the good news.
- I'm afraid there isn't any, sir.

999
01:52:18,367 --> 01:52:20,202
As you can see,
we're more or less surrounded.

1000
01:52:20,369 --> 01:52:24,999
So far we're holding our own, but we're
desperately short of food, medicine...

1001
01:52:25,166 --> 01:52:27,293
...and above all, ammunition.

1002
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:29,545
- Are we getting our daily supply drop?
- Oh, yes.

1003
01:52:29,712 --> 01:52:32,590
The Royal Air Force
are flying in on schedule.

1004
01:52:32,757 --> 01:52:36,385
The trouble is, the Germans
have overrun the dropping zones.

1005
01:52:36,552 --> 01:52:39,597
- Don't our pilots know that?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

1006
01:52:39,764 --> 01:52:41,182
In heaven's name, why?

1007
01:52:41,348 --> 01:52:44,018
It's the radios, sir.

1008
01:52:45,811 --> 01:52:50,399
We still haven't been able to make
contact with anyone outside Arnhem.

1009
01:53:06,165 --> 01:53:08,042
Fools!

1010
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:10,378
Boody fools, this way!

1011
01:53:12,004 --> 01:53:13,923
We're over here!

1012
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:25,935
We're here!

1013
01:53:33,484 --> 01:53:35,736
- This way.
- Drop 'em over here.

1014
01:53:35,903 --> 01:53:38,739
What the hell are they doing?
They must be able to see us.

1015
01:53:38,906 --> 01:53:40,741
They can see us all right, laddie...

1016
01:53:40,908 --> 01:53:43,744
...but they're under orders
to ignore signals from the ground.

1017
01:53:43,911 --> 01:53:45,746
For all they know,
we could be Germans.

1018
01:53:45,913 --> 01:53:48,332
They're giving it all
to the bloody Germans.

1019
01:54:00,428 --> 01:54:01,887
Charles.

1020
01:54:05,433 --> 01:54:07,226
Poor bastard.

1021
01:54:07,393 --> 01:54:10,146
Oh, well, maybe tomorrow.

1022
01:54:23,617 --> 01:54:25,077
Here.

1023
01:54:32,043 --> 01:54:35,296
He'll never make it.
Those bleeding snipers will get him.

1024
01:54:36,714 --> 01:54:38,633
Come back!

1025
01:54:47,892 --> 01:54:49,602
Come on, Ginger mate.

1026
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:59,987
- He'll never lift it.
- Come on, mate!

1027
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,159
Bring it back, mate.
Come on.

1028
01:55:09,455 --> 01:55:11,707
Come on!

1029
01:55:15,753 --> 01:55:17,254
Run, laddie, run!

1030
01:55:24,929 --> 01:55:27,765
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1031
01:56:00,673 --> 01:56:03,384
Taxi!

1032
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:20,818
- Do you get all that?
- She wants somebody to call her a taxi.

1033
01:56:41,339 --> 01:56:42,506
Taxi.

1034
01:57:12,078 --> 01:57:14,330
- Doctor.
- Good evening, Kate.

1035
01:57:14,497 --> 01:57:18,876
May I introduce Mrs. Ter Horst,
Colonel Weaver.

1036
01:57:19,043 --> 01:57:22,463
Is your husband
not returned yet?

1037
01:57:22,672 --> 01:57:24,298
He should have been here by now.

1038
01:57:24,465 --> 01:57:28,010
He must be having difficulties
coming through the German lines.

1039
01:57:29,136 --> 01:57:31,264
Well, in that case...

1040
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:34,016
...we will have to ask you
for a decision.

1041
01:57:34,183 --> 01:57:37,061
Colonel Weaver
has a request to make.

1042
01:57:37,228 --> 01:57:39,605
What we've done is
we've set up...

1043
01:57:39,772 --> 01:57:43,651
...a defensive pocket,
more or less thumb-shaped...

1044
01:57:43,818 --> 01:57:45,736
...with the river as the base.

1045
01:57:45,903 --> 01:57:49,407
Mrs. Ter Horst speaks
surprisingly good English, Colonel.

1046
01:57:50,616 --> 01:57:52,910
Then you understand that we're
in quite a strong position...

1047
01:57:53,077 --> 01:57:55,997
...for holding out
until 30 Corps reaches us.

1048
01:57:56,163 --> 01:57:59,041
But we have to make
certain arrangements.

1049
01:58:00,501 --> 01:58:04,797
The words come through. I don't know
if I follow the military strategy.

1050
01:58:04,964 --> 01:58:08,134
We have the main hospital, of course,
but it is full to bursting.

1051
01:58:10,094 --> 01:58:13,472
Perhaps you understand
that we have great need...

1052
01:58:13,639 --> 01:58:15,558
...of additional space.

1053
01:58:22,481 --> 01:58:25,902
Our house would seem suitable.

1054
01:58:26,068 --> 01:58:28,362
It's just for the slightly wounded.

1055
01:58:28,529 --> 01:58:30,823
You know, we'll patch them up,
send them back... that sort of thing.

1056
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:34,911
I feel it will need
a little more than that.

1057
01:58:40,291 --> 01:58:41,834
We're wasting time. Come.

1058
01:58:42,001 --> 01:58:44,545
- Doctor.
- Thank you, Kate.

1059
01:58:44,754 --> 01:58:48,549
I will see you.
I will come back.

1060
01:58:51,511 --> 01:58:54,222
You come in. Let's see.

1061
01:58:56,432 --> 01:58:58,684
Please sit.
Come take this chair.

1062
01:59:01,437 --> 01:59:04,816
- Come over here with me, lads.
- Thanks very much.

1063
01:59:04,982 --> 01:59:06,901
Sit down.

1064
01:59:07,985 --> 01:59:09,946
Let me help you.

1065
01:59:21,457 --> 01:59:24,043
Oh, colonel,
the major wants you upstairs, sir.

1066
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:26,087
Okay. Thank you.

1067
01:59:29,257 --> 01:59:30,675
All right?

1068
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:39,642
Thank you.

1069
01:59:39,809 --> 01:59:42,311
Still in one piece, Dodds?

1070
01:59:42,478 --> 01:59:45,815
Good. All right, Potter?

1071
01:59:47,233 --> 01:59:49,110
That's far enough!

1072
01:59:49,277 --> 01:59:52,780
We can hear you from there.

1073
01:59:54,782 --> 01:59:57,702
Rather an interesting
development, sir.

1074
01:59:57,869 --> 02:00:03,166
My general says there is no point
in continuing this fighting.

1075
02:00:03,332 --> 02:00:06,544
He is willing to discuss
a surrender.

1076
02:00:10,673 --> 02:00:12,508
Tell him to go to hell.

1077
02:00:14,385 --> 02:00:18,306
We haven't the proper facilities
to take you all prisoner!

1078
02:00:18,473 --> 02:00:19,432
Sorry.

1079
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,100
What?

1080
02:00:21,309 --> 02:00:26,314
We'd like to, but we can't
accept your surrender.

1081
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,902
Was there anything else?

1082
02:00:39,577 --> 02:00:41,037
All right.

1083
02:01:04,769 --> 02:01:07,063
And now?

1084
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:09,649
Flatten Arnhem.

1085
02:02:52,919 --> 02:02:55,713
- Any movement at Nijmegen?
- None.

1086
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:57,340
No way of bLasting through
to the bridge?

1087
02:02:57,548 --> 02:03:01,010
I'd lose all my men for nothing. There's
God knows how many out there already.

1088
02:03:01,219 --> 02:03:02,387
You mean it's over?

1089
02:03:02,553 --> 02:03:04,972
I didn't say that, did I?

1090
02:03:05,139 --> 02:03:06,974
We've paid for that bridge,
and we're going to collect.

1091
02:03:07,141 --> 02:03:09,560
But to do it,
I need tank support.

1092
02:03:10,603 --> 02:03:12,230
You've got it, Jimmy.

1093
02:03:12,397 --> 02:03:15,733
The Grenadier Guards will be happy
to oblige. Is that all right, Alex?

1094
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:17,402
Absolutely.

1095
02:03:17,568 --> 02:03:19,946
It's not just tanks.
I need boats.

1096
02:03:20,113 --> 02:03:23,032
If 30 Corps were American, we would
have boats. Did you bring any?

1097
02:03:23,199 --> 02:03:26,077
- Mike?
- We might have a few about somewhere.

1098
02:03:26,244 --> 02:03:29,414
- Can you get them here by tonight?
- It won't be easy.

1099
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:32,250
We've got one road,
ten-mile traffic jams on it...

1100
02:03:32,417 --> 02:03:34,335
...and Germans throwing shells at us.

1101
02:03:34,502 --> 02:03:37,964
- I don't know quite what we can do...
- Except try. You can do that, can't you?

1102
02:03:39,465 --> 02:03:42,260
Thank you, gentlemen.
Now, look here.

1103
02:03:42,427 --> 02:03:44,429
About these boats...

1104
02:03:44,595 --> 02:03:47,432
What is your opinion?
How many?

1105
02:03:47,598 --> 02:03:51,394
The general's a bit scratchy today,
but it's nothing personal.

1106
02:03:51,561 --> 02:03:53,896
When we dropped on Sunday...

1107
02:03:54,063 --> 02:03:56,399
...I think he cracked his spine.

1108
02:04:05,575 --> 02:04:08,828
- How many boats have we got then?
- About six in each truck.

1109
02:04:22,717 --> 02:04:25,053
Where's Major Cook, soldier?

1110
02:04:26,346 --> 02:04:28,640
- I think over there, sir.
- Thank you.

1111
02:04:44,072 --> 02:04:45,698
Julian, where the hell are you?

1112
02:04:47,408 --> 02:04:48,785
Here, sir.

1113
02:04:53,831 --> 02:04:56,000
We're going to take
Nijmegen Bridge tonight.

1114
02:04:56,167 --> 02:05:00,088
- What's the best way to take a bridge?
- Both ends at once.

1115
02:05:00,964 --> 02:05:03,967
I'm sending two companies
across the river by boat.

1116
02:05:04,133 --> 02:05:06,803
I need a man with
very special qualities to lead.

1117
02:05:08,513 --> 02:05:09,681
Go on, sir.

1118
02:05:09,847 --> 02:05:14,060
He's got to be tough enough
and experienced enough to do it.

1119
02:05:14,227 --> 02:05:15,645
Plus one more thing.

1120
02:05:15,812 --> 02:05:18,022
He's gotta be dumb enough to do it.

1121
02:05:19,649 --> 02:05:21,234
Start getting ready.

1122
02:05:28,533 --> 02:05:30,076
What was all that about?

1123
02:05:31,077 --> 02:05:33,955
Well, someone's come up
with a real nightmare.

1124
02:05:39,585 --> 02:05:42,964
Come on! Keep moving!

1125
02:05:49,929 --> 02:05:52,140
We just got word from
the Dutch Resistance people at Arnhem.

1126
02:05:52,348 --> 02:05:54,976
- And?
- It's not going well for the British.

1127
02:05:55,184 --> 02:05:57,103
Their main force
never reached the bridge.

1128
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:59,314
Those that did are hanging on
by their fingernails.

1129
02:05:59,522 --> 02:06:01,816
- And General Urquhart?
- He's got his back to the river.

1130
02:06:02,025 --> 02:06:05,695
The Germans trapped his men in a pocket
and they're squeezing it smaller.

1131
02:06:05,862 --> 02:06:08,573
How long can he hold?

1132
02:06:09,991 --> 02:06:12,201
Where are those goddamn boats?

1133
02:06:28,676 --> 02:06:30,011
Just keep it clear.

1134
02:06:30,178 --> 02:06:32,138
Right.

1135
02:06:32,305 --> 02:06:34,724
They're no further
than we thought. Julian.

1136
02:06:34,891 --> 02:06:38,019
- Sir.
- There's been a change in plans.

1137
02:06:38,186 --> 02:06:40,104
We're gonna make the crossing
in daylight.

1138
02:06:41,773 --> 02:06:44,192
- Daylight.
- Traffic's all screwed up for miles.

1139
02:06:44,359 --> 02:06:46,110
By the time we're ready,
it'll be 0800.

1140
02:06:46,277 --> 02:06:49,072
- That's when we go.
- Fine.

1141
02:06:50,073 --> 02:06:52,659
I'd like to wait and go tomorrow night,
but the British can't hold.

1142
02:06:54,869 --> 02:06:57,247
Better by daylight.

1143
02:06:57,413 --> 02:06:59,791
Much.

1144
02:07:05,547 --> 02:07:08,091
- Any news of the boats?
- No. We're switching...

1145
02:07:08,258 --> 02:07:10,843
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

1146
02:07:11,052 --> 02:07:13,680
We're switching the start to 9:00
just to make sure.

1147
02:07:13,888 --> 02:07:16,140
You start laying smoke
just before we go.

1148
02:07:16,307 --> 02:07:18,393
Fine.

1149
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,812
They're going to get creamed
from the far embankment.

1150
02:07:20,979 --> 02:07:24,357
Your smoke screen's gonna be
their only protection.

1151
02:07:24,524 --> 02:07:26,943
Don't worry.
We'll cover you.

1152
02:07:28,194 --> 02:07:29,362
Please.

1153
02:07:39,581 --> 02:07:43,710
Okay, can I have
your attention, please?

1154
02:07:43,918 --> 02:07:47,714
I'm pleased to inform you that our 9:00
departure has been postponed till 10:00.

1155
02:07:47,881 --> 02:07:50,550
So you can all have
an extra hour's fun and relaxation.

1156
02:07:51,593 --> 02:07:52,635
- Major?
- Yes.

1157
02:07:52,802 --> 02:07:54,762
We got any more information
on those boats?

1158
02:07:54,929 --> 02:07:59,851
We're reliably informed that they float.
Outside of that, we don't know squat.

1159
02:08:00,018 --> 02:08:03,104
Not how many, not how heavy,
not how big.

1160
02:08:03,271 --> 02:08:07,692
We are sure that the river is wide
and that the current is strong.

1161
02:08:07,859 --> 02:08:11,571
As any more cheery information comes
my way, I'll be happy to pass it along.

1162
02:08:11,738 --> 02:08:14,741
In the meantime, just think of this
as on-the-job training.

1163
02:08:18,077 --> 02:08:20,914
What's the matter?
No sense of humor?

1164
02:08:22,332 --> 02:08:23,750
Goddamn it!

1165
02:08:25,627 --> 02:08:27,212
We go at noon.

1166
02:08:39,849 --> 02:08:42,685
Come on. Clear those roads!

1167
02:09:13,967 --> 02:09:18,888
You men are probably wondering
why I've called us here together.

1168
02:09:20,098 --> 02:09:23,059
I've reached a decision
that I'd like to share with you all.

1169
02:09:25,436 --> 02:09:27,939
I intend to go across
like George Washington...

1170
02:09:28,148 --> 02:09:30,275
...standing on the prow.

1171
02:09:30,441 --> 02:09:31,901
You guys can do the rowing.

1172
02:09:39,492 --> 02:09:42,829
- That's it! Move 'em out!
- Here we go!

1173
02:09:43,913 --> 02:09:45,832
Get up there, guys.

1174
02:09:53,006 --> 02:09:54,466
It's heavy.

1175
02:09:59,304 --> 02:10:00,346
What the...

1176
02:10:00,513 --> 02:10:03,975
What'd you expect, destroyers?
Come on, put it together. Unload 'em.

1177
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:10,398
Easy on them, guys.

1178
02:10:21,993 --> 02:10:24,788
- How many more?
- Get those sides up.

1179
02:10:24,954 --> 02:10:26,664
Fire!

1180
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:35,715
What else can you see
besides smoke?

1181
02:10:35,882 --> 02:10:39,344
Nothing yet, but they are
going to try a river assault.

1182
02:10:40,386 --> 02:10:41,763
It will fail.

1183
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:44,432
Of course it will fail, but...

1184
02:10:44,641 --> 02:10:47,519
...what do we do
if it doesn't?

1185
02:10:47,685 --> 02:10:50,188
I ask your permission
to blow up the bridge.

1186
02:10:50,355 --> 02:10:51,815
Out of the question.

1187
02:10:54,067 --> 02:10:56,945
I understand, Field Marshal.

1188
02:10:57,112 --> 02:11:01,324
They will not cross the river
and we will blow no bridges.

1189
02:11:01,491 --> 02:11:03,118
Have all demolition charges
been checked?

1190
02:11:03,284 --> 02:11:05,995
Yes, sir.
Everything is wired and ready.

1191
02:11:06,162 --> 02:11:08,915
Captain Krafft
is standing by as ordered.

1192
02:11:10,708 --> 02:11:13,670
The bridge will not
fall into enemy hands.

1193
02:11:14,754 --> 02:11:17,298
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross...

1194
02:11:18,758 --> 02:11:20,301
...I'll blow it sky-high.

1195
02:11:33,148 --> 02:11:36,317
- Let's get going!
- All right! Go, go, go!

1196
02:11:55,754 --> 02:11:57,630
Go on. Don't wait. Go.

1197
02:12:11,603 --> 02:12:13,563
Jump in, boys.

1198
02:12:19,819 --> 02:12:23,198
If you don't have an oar,
use your rifle butts, anything.

1199
02:12:23,406 --> 02:12:24,908
Row!

1200
02:12:47,722 --> 02:12:50,183
One, two.

1201
02:12:59,234 --> 02:13:02,112
The current's taking us down.
Stay to your right.

1202
02:13:08,993 --> 02:13:12,038
- Support fire ordered, sir.
- Right. Thank you.

1203
02:13:34,269 --> 02:13:35,562
Get down!

1204
02:13:48,074 --> 02:13:50,368
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1205
02:14:31,451 --> 02:14:34,829
We're drifting!
Pull to your left!

1206
02:14:34,996 --> 02:14:37,332
Pull!

1207
02:14:38,792 --> 02:14:41,252
Keep it going, boys.
Keep rowing.

1208
02:14:49,970 --> 02:14:51,054
Stay down.

1209
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:56,101
Come on, boys.

1210
02:15:04,859 --> 02:15:06,820
Thy will be done.

1211
02:15:18,999 --> 02:15:21,459
Come on. Let's go.

1212
02:15:21,668 --> 02:15:23,545
Let's go!

1213
02:15:39,185 --> 02:15:40,437
Snipers!

1214
02:15:53,533 --> 02:15:54,951
Help me.

1215
02:16:14,804 --> 02:16:16,306
Go up the side.

1216
02:16:25,941 --> 02:16:28,068
Second platoon!

1217
02:16:28,235 --> 02:16:30,737
- Can we make it through the tunnel?
- No way, sir.

1218
02:16:33,698 --> 02:16:35,200
Up the bank.

1219
02:16:49,881 --> 02:16:51,341
Cover.

1220
02:16:59,432 --> 02:17:01,393
Come on.

1221
02:17:45,604 --> 02:17:46,646
Sergeant.

1222
02:17:46,813 --> 02:17:49,608
Take four across, draw fire.
Harry and I'll go up the side.

1223
02:17:49,774 --> 02:17:51,026
You cover.

1224
02:17:51,193 --> 02:17:52,527
Go, go, go!

1225
02:17:58,825 --> 02:17:59,951
Come on.

1226
02:18:00,118 --> 02:18:01,745
Let's go!

1227
02:18:22,349 --> 02:18:23,642
Are you ready?

1228
02:18:23,808 --> 02:18:24,935
Yes, General.

1229
02:18:41,952 --> 02:18:43,829
Goddamn it.

1230
02:19:33,378 --> 02:19:36,631
My God, they're only
18 kilometers from Arnhem.

1231
02:19:37,716 --> 02:19:40,218
Who can stop them now?

1232
02:19:41,678 --> 02:19:43,847
No one.

1233
02:20:15,337 --> 02:20:17,214
Oh, hell.

1234
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:19,216
Any chance, Whitney?

1235
02:20:19,382 --> 02:20:21,384
No, sir, not unless we're relieved
in the next few hours.

1236
02:20:21,551 --> 02:20:23,386
Harry?

1237
02:20:23,553 --> 02:20:26,640
- Try and get him down to the cellar.
- Very good, sir.

1238
02:20:51,998 --> 02:20:53,667
It's working.

1239
02:20:53,834 --> 02:20:55,669
I'm through to H.Q.
Where's the colonel?

1240
02:20:55,836 --> 02:20:57,087
- Down below.
- Get him.

1241
02:20:57,254 --> 02:20:59,673
- Colonel Frost!
- What is it?

1242
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:01,716
Up top.

1243
02:21:04,636 --> 02:21:06,930
It's Headquarters, sir,
on the radio.

1244
02:21:07,097 --> 02:21:08,140
Coming.

1245
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:15,147
Sunray on set.
Pass your message. Over.

1246
02:21:15,313 --> 02:21:17,691
What's your situation, Johnny?
Over.

1247
02:21:17,858 --> 02:21:20,485
I hadn't expected
the pleasure, sir.

1248
02:21:20,694 --> 02:21:22,738
We are holding out.

1249
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:28,243
We need reinforcements
and above all, ammunition. Over.

1250
02:21:28,410 --> 02:21:31,163
I'm not sure if it's a case
of us coming for you...

1251
02:21:31,371 --> 02:21:33,582
...or you coming for us.

1252
02:21:33,749 --> 02:21:36,501
Well, we'll just wait
for 30 Corps then.

1253
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:38,378
That would probably be best.

1254
02:21:38,545 --> 02:21:41,173
Very reassuring
talking to you, sir.

1255
02:21:43,258 --> 02:21:45,677
I'm sorry, Johnny, getting stuck
on that bloody bridge...

1256
02:21:45,844 --> 02:21:48,138
...four days on your own.

1257
02:21:48,305 --> 02:21:49,556
Have you anything else for me?

1258
02:21:49,723 --> 02:21:53,560
No, sir. I'll give you a call
when our friends arrive. Over.

1259
02:21:53,727 --> 02:21:56,146
All right.

1260
02:21:56,313 --> 02:21:59,149
Good luck. Out.

1261
02:22:05,864 --> 02:22:08,200
- Sergeant Tomblin!
- Here, sir.

1262
02:22:08,408 --> 02:22:10,035
I'm coming over.

1263
02:22:13,038 --> 02:22:14,623
Sergeant Taylor!

1264
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:27,677
I don't understand.
Why aren't you moving?

1265
02:22:27,844 --> 02:22:29,304
What's the matter with you guys?

1266
02:22:29,471 --> 02:22:32,391
Those are British troops
at Arnhem.

1267
02:22:32,557 --> 02:22:34,559
They're hurt bad.

1268
02:22:34,726 --> 02:22:37,729
You're not gonna stop,
not now.

1269
02:22:37,896 --> 02:22:40,190
I'm sorry.
We have our orders.

1270
02:22:40,357 --> 02:22:42,859
We busted our asses getting here.
Half my men are killed.

1271
02:22:43,026 --> 02:22:45,696
You're just gonna stop...

1272
02:22:45,862 --> 02:22:48,490
...and drink tea?

1273
02:22:48,657 --> 02:22:50,951
We're now facing a completely
different situation.

1274
02:22:51,118 --> 02:22:54,913
We can't lead with tanks up that road.
Jerry'll pick us off like sitting ducks.

1275
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:58,750
Our infantry is fighting in Nijmegen.
When they get here, we'll move on.

1276
02:23:04,131 --> 02:23:06,717
For Christ's sake, must you
do everything by the book?

1277
02:23:06,883 --> 02:23:10,137
Our orders are to wait
for the infantry.

1278
02:23:10,303 --> 02:23:11,722
I'm sorry, but there it is.

1279
02:23:23,859 --> 02:23:26,236
It's Major Carlyle, sir.

1280
02:23:40,208 --> 02:23:42,210
All right. I'm all right.

1281
02:23:55,265 --> 02:23:58,018
Things are not so good, eh?

1282
02:24:03,899 --> 02:24:06,818
I've been meaning
to ask you something...

1283
02:24:06,985 --> 02:24:10,530
...and I haven't because I know
you were so anxious that I should...

1284
02:24:12,366 --> 02:24:15,202
...and I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1285
02:24:18,789 --> 02:24:22,709
Why the hell do you always carry
that bloody umbrella?

1286
02:24:24,419 --> 02:24:27,214
- Memory.
- What?

1287
02:24:27,381 --> 02:24:30,133
Bad memory.

1288
02:24:32,052 --> 02:24:35,222
Always forgot the password.

1289
02:24:38,475 --> 02:24:40,560
I knew no Jerry...

1290
02:24:40,727 --> 02:24:43,105
...would ever carry one.

1291
02:24:45,107 --> 02:24:48,277
I had...

1292
02:24:48,443 --> 02:24:52,322
...to prove I was an Englishman.

1293
02:25:19,182 --> 02:25:22,311
Get back!
Back into the houses.

1294
02:25:35,073 --> 02:25:37,826
30 Corps, please hurry.

1295
02:25:45,292 --> 02:25:47,878
- Nothing, sir.
- All right. Thank you, Corporal.

1296
02:25:48,045 --> 02:25:50,756
It's no use in any event.
Take my boot off, will you, Wicks?

1297
02:25:50,923 --> 02:25:53,467
Hello, 30 Corps.

1298
02:25:53,634 --> 02:25:56,094
Oh, God!

1299
02:26:01,058 --> 02:26:03,644
We're out of ammunition anyway.

1300
02:26:05,228 --> 02:26:07,940
Right. Off you go, Wicks.
Join the rest of the lads.

1301
02:26:08,106 --> 02:26:09,650
Try and get back
to the main force.

1302
02:26:09,858 --> 02:26:11,902
- What about you, sir?
- I'll be all right.

1303
02:26:12,945 --> 02:26:15,739
We just didn't make it
this time, did we?

1304
02:26:22,162 --> 02:26:25,666
Calling 30 Corps.
Come in, please.

1305
02:27:36,862 --> 02:27:38,989
My general says
please take it.

1306
02:27:39,156 --> 02:27:40,991
It's very good chocolate.

1307
02:27:41,158 --> 02:27:43,660
Your planes dropped it to us
yesterday.

1308
02:27:57,090 --> 02:27:58,342
English.

1309
02:28:11,772 --> 02:28:14,024
Action stations!

1310
02:28:14,191 --> 02:28:17,361
God bless
Field Marshal Montgomery.

1311
02:29:59,630 --> 02:30:05,511
Would five minutes
be too much?

1312
02:30:07,262 --> 02:30:09,181
Just five minutes respite.

1313
02:30:12,351 --> 02:30:15,437
Dear God...

1314
02:30:15,604 --> 02:30:17,981
...grant these young men...

1315
02:30:19,191 --> 02:30:22,611
...die in peace and quiet.

1316
02:30:45,634 --> 02:30:48,470
I'm sorry, lads,
but you're going to have to move.

1317
02:30:58,021 --> 02:30:59,440
Please.

1318
02:31:00,607 --> 02:31:03,277
Take my hand.

1319
02:31:05,863 --> 02:31:07,948
We're a bit late
with this one, mate.

1320
02:31:15,581 --> 02:31:19,251
"Surely He shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler...

1321
02:31:19,418 --> 02:31:23,213
...and from the noisome pestilence.

1322
02:31:23,380 --> 02:31:26,091
He shall cover thee
with His feathers...

1323
02:31:26,258 --> 02:31:29,011
...and under His wings
shalt thou trust.

1324
02:31:29,219 --> 02:31:32,514
His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler."

1325
02:31:51,658 --> 02:31:53,952
There you go. Head back.

1326
02:31:55,162 --> 02:31:57,623
You'll be all right now, chum.

1327
02:32:04,213 --> 02:32:06,840
Can it get worse?

1328
02:32:07,007 --> 02:32:10,135
Oh, yes, much worse.

1329
02:32:26,485 --> 02:32:29,029
Bring up the bulldozer.

1330
02:32:39,998 --> 02:32:41,917
Stretcher bearer!

1331
02:32:45,421 --> 02:32:46,547
Help me!

1332
02:32:48,090 --> 02:32:49,383
Stretcher.

1333
02:32:52,803 --> 02:32:55,264
Easy, now. Take it easy.

1334
02:32:56,515 --> 02:32:59,393
Morphia. I must have morphia.

1335
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:02,604
Morphia is only for
the people who are really hurt.

1336
02:33:02,771 --> 02:33:05,232
I thought I was really hurt.

1337
02:33:05,399 --> 02:33:07,276
Well, you're wrong.

1338
02:33:08,485 --> 02:33:11,613
I asked him to come over,
but Dr. Spaander does agree with me.

1339
02:33:11,780 --> 02:33:14,908
- We've got to do something about them.
- Yes, what? Good day, Doctor.

1340
02:33:15,075 --> 02:33:20,080
General Urquhart, we have no more space
and we have no more supplies.

1341
02:33:20,247 --> 02:33:22,499
And since a prisoner of war...

1342
02:33:22,666 --> 02:33:24,793
...has more chance
than no chance at all...

1343
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:27,254
I have a mind
to ask the Germans...

1344
02:33:27,421 --> 02:33:30,090
...to accept our wounded
into their hospitals...

1345
02:33:30,257 --> 02:33:33,010
...if we could arrange evacuation.

1346
02:33:33,177 --> 02:33:36,347
- Have I your permission to try?
- Certainly.

1347
02:33:36,513 --> 02:33:40,059
If Weaver agrees.
But I hardly think the Germans will.

1348
02:33:40,225 --> 02:33:44,480
Those are our guns out there.
That's 30 Corps.

1349
02:33:44,647 --> 02:33:47,941
I don't think my permission
is going to be your major problem.

1350
02:33:59,119 --> 02:34:01,080
I've come with a message
from General Urquhart.

1351
02:34:01,288 --> 02:34:03,165
How you manage that?

1352
02:34:03,332 --> 02:34:05,709
I swam the Rhine, sir.

1353
02:34:05,876 --> 02:34:08,879
I'm afraid the radios
are all up the spout.

1354
02:34:09,046 --> 02:34:12,716
The general asks if you'll
get your men across the river.

1355
02:34:12,883 --> 02:34:16,011
We've been holding out
for six days now.

1356
02:34:16,178 --> 02:34:18,847
Any help at all would be
of considerable assistance.

1357
02:34:19,932 --> 02:34:21,934
You swim back with reply?

1358
02:34:22,142 --> 02:34:23,310
Yes, sir.

1359
02:34:24,478 --> 02:34:27,106
Well, we can't swim...

1360
02:34:27,314 --> 02:34:29,566
...not with equipment.

1361
02:34:29,733 --> 02:34:32,403
We have small rubber boats,
that's all.

1362
02:34:32,569 --> 02:34:35,114
I'm afraid rubber dinghies
may be a bit flimsy for the Rhine, sir.

1363
02:34:35,322 --> 02:34:37,199
I agree.

1364
02:34:42,371 --> 02:34:44,999
Tell the general we're coming.

1365
02:34:45,165 --> 02:34:47,209
We're coming tonight.

1366
02:34:47,376 --> 02:34:49,295
Yes, sir.

1367
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:44,970
Not possible.

1368
02:37:45,137 --> 02:37:49,600
If you would just say yes,
it would be very possible.

1369
02:37:49,767 --> 02:37:53,020
Forgive me,
but there is a battle...

1370
02:37:53,187 --> 02:37:55,481
...and we are in the process
of winning it.

1371
02:37:56,690 --> 02:38:00,110
Winning and losing
is not our concern.

1372
02:38:00,277 --> 02:38:03,113
Living or dying is.

1373
02:38:04,865 --> 02:38:07,159
Cease fire...

1374
02:38:07,326 --> 02:38:10,412
...one more hour, two...

1375
02:38:10,621 --> 02:38:12,915
...just to evacuate our wounded.

1376
02:38:14,208 --> 02:38:18,921
Afterwards you can kill us
as much as you want to.

1377
02:38:24,802 --> 02:38:26,762
General Ludwig.

1378
02:39:07,928 --> 02:39:10,014
- Will you thank him, please?
- I just did.

1379
02:39:10,890 --> 02:39:13,267
Please, you can go.

1380
02:40:43,023 --> 02:40:44,984
How short are we? A mile?

1381
02:40:53,951 --> 02:40:57,830
Why don't we just try
to bash through?

1382
02:40:57,997 --> 02:41:00,499
For God's sake,
it must be worth it.

1383
02:41:00,708 --> 02:41:03,878
They're trying to force Urquhart
away from the river.

1384
02:41:05,129 --> 02:41:07,465
Now, once they do that...

1385
02:41:07,631 --> 02:41:11,469
...once they've got him surrounded,
he'll be annihilated.

1386
02:41:11,635 --> 02:41:13,679
Not in Monty's plan at all.

1387
02:41:15,014 --> 02:41:17,349
Have we replaced the boats
we lost at Nijmegen?

1388
02:41:19,143 --> 02:41:20,227
Yes.

1389
02:41:21,771 --> 02:41:23,230
Well?

1390
02:41:25,733 --> 02:41:27,234
Well, then?

1391
02:41:33,574 --> 02:41:36,744
Well, that's it then.
We're pulling them out.

1392
02:41:43,084 --> 02:41:45,044
It was Nijmegen.

1393
02:41:45,211 --> 02:41:49,673
It was the single road
getting to Nijmegen.

1394
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:52,051
No, it was after Nijmegen.

1395
02:41:56,138 --> 02:41:57,681
And the fog...

1396
02:41:57,890 --> 02:41:59,725
...in England.

1397
02:42:04,063 --> 02:42:06,732
It doesn't matter what it was.

1398
02:42:06,899 --> 02:42:09,777
When one man says to another,
"Today let's play the war game"...

1399
02:42:12,029 --> 02:42:13,948
...everybody dies.

1400
02:42:17,493 --> 02:42:18,911
"Withdraw"?

1401
02:42:21,664 --> 02:42:24,750
Two days, they said.
We've been here nine.

1402
02:42:26,252 --> 02:42:29,088
One bloody mile. You'd think
they could accomplish that.

1403
02:42:30,798 --> 02:42:33,217
- Hancock, here are another two.
- All right. Thank you.

1404
02:42:33,384 --> 02:42:35,720
They're the last two
I could find.

1405
02:42:35,886 --> 02:42:37,888
Charles?

1406
02:42:38,097 --> 02:42:40,975
We've been given
our marching orders.

1407
02:42:43,144 --> 02:42:46,230
If they discover we're leaving,
they'll go all out to destroy us.

1408
02:42:46,397 --> 02:42:48,566
So we must take every precaution.

1409
02:42:48,733 --> 02:42:51,402
I've designed this
like a collapsing bag.

1410
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:53,904
Macdonald here has agreed
to man the wireless...

1411
02:42:54,071 --> 02:42:56,073
...in order to give the Germans
something to listen to.

1412
02:42:56,240 --> 02:43:00,328
All the padres and medical staff
have volunteered to stay behind as well.

1413
02:43:00,494 --> 02:43:02,580
Now, the wounded
who are too bad to move...

1414
02:43:02,788 --> 02:43:05,082
...will replace the men firing...

1415
02:43:05,249 --> 02:43:07,835
...so our defense
will seem as before.

1416
02:43:08,002 --> 02:43:10,129
By the time the Germans
find out what's happening...

1417
02:43:10,296 --> 02:43:13,257
...we should all be safely
across the river.

1418
02:43:14,633 --> 02:43:17,428
- Pleasant journey.
- Thank you, sir.

1419
02:43:46,624 --> 02:43:49,460
- Are you all right, laddie?
- Thank you, sir.

1420
02:45:13,002 --> 02:45:16,464
I'm beginning to believe
we're actually going to make it, sir.

1421
02:45:16,672 --> 02:45:18,633
I thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.

1422
02:45:52,833 --> 02:45:54,835
Come on. Don't hang about.

1423
02:46:56,439 --> 02:46:59,025
General Browning will be down
right away, sir.

1424
02:47:05,281 --> 02:47:09,118
He wondered if you perhaps
might like to change.

1425
02:47:09,285 --> 02:47:11,871
- Change?
- Your clothes, sir.

1426
02:47:13,915 --> 02:47:15,875
No, thanks.

1427
02:47:31,849 --> 02:47:33,768
Hello, Roy.

1428
02:47:36,604 --> 02:47:37,688
How are you?

1429
02:47:39,607 --> 02:47:42,401
I'm not sure
that I'll know for a while.

1430
02:47:43,694 --> 02:47:45,571
But I'm sorry about
the way it worked out.

1431
02:47:47,865 --> 02:47:49,492
You did all you could.

1432
02:47:51,410 --> 02:47:54,080
Yes, but did everyone else?

1433
02:47:57,959 --> 02:48:00,002
They've got a bed for you upstairs,
if you want it.

1434
02:48:01,963 --> 02:48:04,423
I took 10,000 men into Arnhem.

1435
02:48:04,632 --> 02:48:06,884
I've come out with less than 2,000.

1436
02:48:07,051 --> 02:48:09,554
I don't feel much like sleeping.

1437
02:48:10,513 --> 02:48:11,973
Quite.

1438
02:48:14,517 --> 02:48:17,687
I've just been on to Monty.

1439
02:48:17,854 --> 02:48:20,022
He's very proud and pleased.

1440
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:23,234
- Pleased?
- Of course.

1441
02:48:24,944 --> 02:48:28,197
<i>He thinks Market Garden
was 90/ successful. </i>

1442
02:48:29,407 --> 02:48:32,118
But what do you think?

1443
02:48:33,995 --> 02:48:37,874
Well, as you know, I've always thought
we tried to go a bridge too far.

1444
02:49:09,405 --> 02:49:10,823
Mind his head.

1445
02:49:15,995 --> 02:49:17,622
Thanks, Taff.

1446
02:50:23,563 --> 02:50:28,901
