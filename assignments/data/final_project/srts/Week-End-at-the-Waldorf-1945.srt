1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,300
WEEK-END at the WALDORF

3
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,400
<i>Here is the Waldorf Astoria.</i>

4
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,700
<i>Big place, isn't it?</i>

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,320
<i>But it's home to me,
because I happen to live there.</i>

6
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,950
<i>In fact, you might read
my newspaper column:</i>

7
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,000
<i>"Randy Morton's New York ",</i>

8
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,100
<i>Of course, it's rather
widely syndicated.</i>

9
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>When this week-end
had started, Cassidy, the doorman</i>

10
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,300
<i>was on duty as usual,
and I must confess was rather nervously</i>

11
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,700
<i>strolling along with my Scotty Suzy.</i>

12
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,300
<i>Suzy was facing
a big crisis in her life.</i>

13
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,800
<i>She was about to be come a...
that is, she was expecting</i>

14
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,000
<i>Well, I'm sorry.</i>

15
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,200
<i>I don't know how this little character
ever landed in Park Avenue.</i>

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
<i>But anyway, it all started
with the arrival of</i>

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
<i>a young honeymoon couple
at the  hotel.</i>

18
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,100
<i>It was a Friday afternoon,
around tea time.</i>

19
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,900
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

20
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
I just need my shore legs.

21
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,500
Look Johnny,
that is David Cugat.

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,600
That must be
the "Wedgewood Room."

23
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,900
Oh, Johnny!

24
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Come on, honey,
we'll lose the bellboy.

25
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,100
I'm sorry, Mr. Morton, but there's
no listing for "Ackmy Cats and Dogs" Bideawee.

26
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,100
Are you sure you got
the name right - Ackmy?

27
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,800
That peculiar Lady Bush told me
she had three cats there.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,700
Excuse me, where's
the Irene Malvern shindig?

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,000
- Please ask the receptioner.
- Thank you very much.

30
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,250
It was Bideawee, I'm sure she said.

31
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,800
Pardon me, where's
the reception for Irene Malvern?

32
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,160
39th 4 Towers.
Please check for the Towers.

33
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm ready, sir.

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,100
- Ensign Wright and Mrs. Wright.
- Have you a reservation?

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,900
- I sent you a wire we arrive on Friday.
- Just a moment please.

36
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,560
She sneezed twice this morning.
I wonder if that means anything?

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,600
- In my experience, no.
- And she refused her biscuits at breakfast.

38
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,700
We have your telegram,
but unfortunately.
we have no accommodation

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,500
- You haven't?
- We telephoned around
and there is a room available...

40
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,300
...at a very nice little hotel...
- But we came to Waldorf.

41
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,800
- We'll only stay till Monday morning.
- I'm sorry..

42
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,200
We spent the whole night
on the day coach
not even in the same car.

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,800
I've always dreamt about
staying here..

44
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,960
About staying at Waldorf.

45
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,840
Just a minute.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,700
They are full, dear.
Maybe that other place...

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
I know but...

48
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,600
A honeymoon couple.
See the rice?

49
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
Perhaps they've just had
a Chinese dinner.

50
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,200
Any important messages for me?

51
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,100
- I'll be at my place
in Connecticut till Monday.
- Yes, Mr. Jessup.

52
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,500
See those bride and groom
trying to get a room?

53
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,640
When he said it's a honeymoon couple,
I made a rather funny crack.

54
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,700
How was it I said...

55
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,100
Something or other...

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,300
I'm sorry, sir.

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,300
We've decided to wait
until you do have a room.

58
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,500
Don't think I can make any promises.
I'll do my best.

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,200
We just can't go anyplace.
We just can't.

60
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
- Excuse me.
- Yes, Mr. Jessup.

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,600
- They can have my apartment
over the weekend.
- Very good, Mr. Jessup.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,200
- That's very nice of you, sir.
- Thank you very much.

63
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,200
How much is the apartment?
I mean, what's the rate?

64
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,400
Don't worry about that,
I keep it all the year round.

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,700
- That doesn't seem right somehow.
- That's all right.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,600
You see, I lost a boy about your age
in the South Pacific.

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,000
Mr. Jessup.  Mr. Martin Edley
would like to speak to you
on the house phone, sir.

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,100
I'll take it.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Hello, Edley.
What's on your mind?

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,300
I got a wire
from the  Bey of Aribajan.

71
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,800
His Highness will be arriving here
any minute now.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Get to the point, Edley,
I haven't much time.

73
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
You know what a deal
with Aribajan would mean?

74
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,000
I thought you would like
to go in with me?

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,200
I wouldn't.

76
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,300
Would you like me to read
the wire I got from him?

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,000
Stevens, give me that wire
in that drawer there.

78
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,100
Hold on a moment, please.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,900
Here it is.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Now listen...

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,400
Hello. Hello!

82
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,200
Hello, operator,
you cut me off.

83
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,800
Yes, Mr Edley,
I'll try to get Mr. Jessup back for you.

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,800
I'm sorry, Miss Malvern is not in.

85
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
Her secretary suggested
you send her scenario
to the studio.

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,800
I thought she was wonderful
in the 'Forgotten Angel'.

87
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,700
Yes, just a moment, please.

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Morton,
but the information has no listing

89
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
for the "Ackmy, Dogs
and Cats", Bideawee.

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,100
Are you sure you
have that name right?
What's that?

91
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Try Ackny?
Very well, Mr. Morton.

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,800
Just a moment, please.

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,100
Beverly Hills, California,
calling Miss Malvern.

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,500
Sorry,  Mr. Jessup has just left
for the  week-end.

95
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,500
Gone for the week-end.

96
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,500
The President
of the Volcanic Oil Co
can't be bothered

97
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,200
with as little as
a 100 million dollar deal.

98
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,200
He's a New-Yorker for you!
No vision, no enterprise.

99
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,600
- Just a staff shirt.
- Wasn't interested?

100
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,900
I wouldn't touch him
with a ten foot pole.

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,400
- I'm going ahead anyway.
- With what?

102
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,100
We'll tell the Bey
that we've got Jessup with us,

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,300
- ...that Gideon Oil is a subsidiary.
- That's dangerous.

104
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,800
- Who's gonna know?
- We have to work fast.

105
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Did you ever see me in action?

106
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,800
I am a self-made man.
How do you think I did it??

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,600
- I've been asked that question before.
- All right then, I'll tell you.

108
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,900
I've got vision, I've got enterprise.
Mr. Jessup has none.

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,900
But he's on his way out
and I am on my way in.

110
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Eh? Speaking.

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,400
Fine, we'll be right down.

112
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,000
Someone else is on his way in.
His Highness the Bey.

113
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,760
Great! Come on!

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,500
- Who is that?
- The Bey of Aribajan.

115
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,900
His Highness will be glad
to see you on Monday week.

116
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,600
My Board of Directors
meets this Monday.

117
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,900
I've got to present
a closed deal.

118
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,400
His Highness
has chosen to reconsider.

119
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
If Mr Edley will dine with him tonight?

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,500
Oh, that's great!

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,200
I'm certainly glad
you are here, Your Highness.

122
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
It's too bad you don't speak English,
but we're in business.

123
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,500
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Go on.

124
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,500
The first thing to do
is to put the proposition on paper.

125
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,360
Hello.

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,700
Can I have the public
stenographer's office, please?

127
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,200
It's  Martin  Edley,  39-E.
I want a secretary.

128
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,000
Send me that little blond
who was here yesterday.

129
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,300
Yes, Bunny something or other.

130
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,400
This way, sir.

131
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,900
Well, angel face.

132
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,500
- Come into my parlor.
- Yes, Mr. Spider.

133
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
Hello, Edley.

134
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,680
Shades of peace
and prosperity.

135
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,300
If it isn't my old friend
Martin X. Edley!

136
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
Chip Collyer.

137
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
- What are you doing back in N. York?
- How is life..

138
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,800
...in a penitentiary?

139
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,100
You wrote a lot of lies about me.
You know very well I was acquitted.

140
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,400
Yes, because I was
off to war.

141
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
Oh, sorry!
Hi.

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,700
I want you to meet
my esteemed managing editor, Mr. Johns.

143
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,320
This is Martin Edley.

144
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,900
If you remember
we raised a little action
with Gideon Oil in the good old days.

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
I knew nothing about that deal.

146
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm off to war again on Monday,
so whatever you are up to,
just relax.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,520
By the way,
are you up to anything?

148
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,300
I should have you
thrown out of this hotel.

149
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,080
Thinks back to good old days.

150
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,400
If I weren't bent on sleeping,
I'd look into that gentleman's activity.

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,700
Oh yeah!

152
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,800
- Pretty nice foxhole!
- Yep.

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,700
Eat, sleep, read, relax.
All yours till Monday
and the paper pays for the works.

154
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,300
I will sleep is all I want.

155
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
Just sleep.

156
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,100
Wow!
I hope I don't walk in my sleep.

157
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,920
Who's that? You said
you wouldn't tell anyone
I was here.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,700
- Now, I only want...
- Yes, I know you won't.

159
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,200
- Who is it?
- A waiter.

160
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
I thought you might
like something.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,600
- Come in.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,500
- Mr. Collyer.
- Hello, Emile.

163
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,100
- How do you do, sir?
- Glad to see you.

164
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
- Thank you.
- I haven't seen you since you..

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,300
...put me to bed
at he Publishers' Convention.

166
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,700
That's right.
February 15,  1939.

167
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,640
-Welcome back to America, Mr Collyer.
- Thank you.

168
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,500
Why, you've been away a long time.

169
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,900
I read your dispatches
from all over the world,

170
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,400
Spain, London,
France, Africa.

171
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,000
- Did you really?
- Yes, sir.

172
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,800
- Are you going to stay with us
for a while? - Just until Monday.

173
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,000
- Off so soon?
- That's Simon's idea, not mine.

174
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,960
What about a little drink, Chip?

175
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,920
Suits me.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,500
- Did you put that wine on ice?
- Yes sir, it's right here
in the pantry, sir.

177
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,400
I don't know...

178
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,300
...if I can wait for that wine or not.

179
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,200
Heads, I take my clothes off.
Tails, I sleep as is. Tails.

180
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,840
Attaboy, Chip. I want you fresh,
and raring to go.

181
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
Yep, I know.

182
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,800
Raring to go back there.

183
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,400
Hi.

184
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,800
Have you ever
seen man die...

185
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,200
...slowly..?

186
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,500
Now wait a minute.

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,400
Well, I have

188
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,000
wholesale.

189
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,000
Spain,

190
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,100
London, France,

191
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,300
Germany.

192
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,300
It ain't pretty.

193
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,100
Here we are, sir.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
- I am tired.
- I know.

195
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,000
You know they send flyers back
after so many missions.

196
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,700
Well, you had a rest,
two weeks.

197
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,200
Twelve banquets...
Thank you very much.

198
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Four lectures.
Newspaper publishers' conferences.

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,300
A cocktail party,
and one crap game in which I lost.

200
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,400
You'll feel all that better
after you have a little sleep.

201
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,300
You know, the man really needed it.

202
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
- Is there anything else, sir?
- No, I think that's all, Emile.
Thank you.

203
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,640
And don't bother coming back because
I'll be asleep in 5 minutes, or maybe less.

204
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,280
- Very well, sir.
- I'm gonna sleep for 48 hours.

205
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,400
I have to admit you're
getting a little stale.

206
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,100
That's why I brought you home
to give you a rest,

207
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,500
...to give you a fresh point of view.

208
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,300
Stale. I've gotten past the point
of being stale. I'm empty.

209
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,400
I don't see any more,
I don't feel.

210
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,100
Every word's an effort,
every word's tired.

211
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,500
You'll feel a lot different
once you get back to Europe again.

212
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,900
- Why don't you let me stay home?
- What for?

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,600
Look, you can get half a dozen
fresh kids..

214
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,700
...and get much more
out of any one of them.

215
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,700
- Have another drink.
- It won't do any good, I've tried it.

216
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,100
...but I'll have it.

217
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,300
You'll feel a whole lot better...

218
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,700
..after you have some sleep.

219
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,200
You want me to put out
a "Do not disturb" sign?

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,600
No, I'll take care of myself.
A carry my own.

221
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I hope you have a good rest,

222
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,600
...and pleasant dreams.

223
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
And I'll settle for nightmares.

224
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,000
By the way, do you want me
to wake you up on Monday morning?

225
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,400
Don't you come here before.

226
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
- Well, bye, Chip.
- Bye, Hi.

227
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,900
Hello.

228
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,000
Chip Collyer? This is  Randy Morton,
we met once, I think.

229
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,480
Anyway, Irene Malvern, a movie star,
is having a cocktail party here

230
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,900
...for the press
and her press agent
came up with a grand idea:

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,600
If you drop by,
so we could get her picture.

232
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,800
<i>You know, Miss Malvern between the man
from the war front, that's you,</i>

233
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,900
...and the man on the home front,
I was on the Air-Raid Board.
How do we meet?

234
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,900
This is General Martínez
de Esperanza speaking.

235
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,700
I know no you,
and I know no Miss Malvern.

236
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,000
So I'm very chilly to your suggestion.

237
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,300
Definitely,
not a good neighbor.

238
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,000
- What do you mean?
- Somebody gave a bum steer, that's all.

239
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,000
I told you Collyer
was not at the hotel.
Sorry, Steve.

240
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, it was an idea. Oh excuse me,
I've got to see Mr Burton.

241
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,000
I think she is mad about it.
All I asked was 15.000 dollars.

242
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,800
You are the luckiest producer
in the business, Burton.

243
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,500
I wish I had a star
like Irene.

244
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,600
No shenanigans, no nonsense,
no temper, no divorces.

245
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,900
- No relatives. Skilly.
- Yes, boss.

246
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,600
- Get around.
- Get around? Sure, boss.

247
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,100
I don't know, so if I don't
get there you'll understand.

248
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,100
Miss Malvern.

249
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,000
- I'm so glad
to get to New York.
- Thank you.

250
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,600
I shall read your book
first thing in the morning.
Did you inscribe it?

251
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,160
- Right there.
- How lovely.

252
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,500
I feel so stimulated.
New York really is so...

253
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,000
Excuse me.

254
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,800
This show is going on for 3 hours, she's got
to be fresh for tomorrow morning.

255
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
OK, boss.

256
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,700
Well, that's over.

257
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,400
You still got the opening of your picture
to go to tomorrow night.

258
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,400
Saturday. Then Sunday.
On Monday you leave.

259
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Four days on the train,
rest.

260
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,100
You don't have to start "Farewell,
my Darling" until...

261
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,400
...a week from tomorrow.

262
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,600
A week from tomorrow.

263
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,700
Tired?

264
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,600
No.

265
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,500
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.

266
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,360
You are not dated up?
How about dinner and a show?
I'll organize a small party

267
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,300
No.

268
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,100
- I thought you knew thousands of people in N.-Y.?
- I do.

269
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,200
- You don't want to see them?
- No.

270
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,300
Irene, I've never
seen you like this before.

271
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,800
I've never felt like this before.

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Now, come on! What's the matter?

273
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,200
Feeling low?
Say, maybe you're anemic.

274
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,900
Maybe you need a doctor.
Do you take vitamins?

275
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,800
By the tons.

276
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,200
Holy mackerel!
You are not in love?

277
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,300
Yes.

278
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Somebody I know?

279
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,100
- No.
- Some tramp?

280
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,100
- I resent that.
- I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry..

281
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,300
Naturally I thought it was a tramp
because you are so unhappy about it.

282
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,300
Well, he is not a tramp.
He's wonderful.

283
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,700
He's handsome,

284
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,200
...he's wise,

285
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,200
...strong, steady,

286
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,800
he's witty.

287
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,100
- He's charming, he's...
- Say, who is this guy?

288
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,200
He's as real as
everything else in my life.
He just doesn't exist.

289
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,400
And you got mad
because I called him a tramp.

290
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,800
Wouldn't you?

291
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,700
You're a funny girl.

292
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,700
Henry, would you like to see a present
from a fan?

293
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,500
The most appropriate present
I ever got.

294
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,300
The history of my life.
Put on one mask,

295
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,700
...take it off.
Put on another.

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Till you realize
that I've never lived,

297
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,600
...and nothing has ever
happened to me.

298
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,500
School,  theater,
pictures.

299
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,200
Other people get married,
have adventures,
bear children, live.

300
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,300
And Henry, it's beginning to show
right up there, on that screen.

301
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,120
Ridiculous.
Your life has brought you 2 million three...

302
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,200
All right.
File and forget.

303
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,700
Pardon, Miss Malvern.

304
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,500
Dr. Campbell is on his way up.

305
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,500
- Will you tell him to come in here?
- You called a doctor?

306
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,000
Good, he'll give you
some vitamin B
and you'll be a different woman.

307
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,900
Say, did I ever tell you what happened
to my wife last summer?

308
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,400
She was feeling kind of low,
you know.

309
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
She went around saying
I bored her, can you imagine?

310
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,500
No.

311
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,400
Bobby.

312
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,700
Hello, Taffy.

313
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,560
- Henry Burton, Dr. Campbell.
- Very glad.

314
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,300
Take care, doc,
she's a valuable property.

315
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,300
Say, what do you say
about  vitamin B for her?

316
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,100
I'm not here professionally,
besides, I'm a surgeon.

317
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,920
- You're not gonna cut her up?
- Run along, Henry.

318
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,840
He's known me
since I was a kid.

319
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,200
Just the same, you look her over
while you're here.

320
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh say, doctor, by the way.

321
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm inclined to have
a little pain right over here.

322
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,440
I had my appendix out last year.
What do you think it could be?

323
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,800
- Henry.
- All right, all right.

324
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,300
I'm gonna find out.

325
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,800
I've been to 6 doctors
and they tell me
I'm imagining things.

326
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
I haven't got
that much imagination.

327
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,500
You really should examine him, Bobby.

328
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,700
You'll probably find
he's made of celluloid,

329
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
just like me.

330
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,900
May I express
a professional opinion?

331
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,300
- Fire away.
- Take a rest.

332
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,100
Thank you, doctor.

333
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm going to take one.
4 days on the train.

334
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,100
A ride is not a rest.

335
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,200
Bobby.

336
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,800
Do you mind if I
don't go to your wedding tomorrow?

337
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,200
It's rather hard to explain,
it's just that...

338
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,000
I can't face people.

339
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,300
Of course,
if you don't want to come...

340
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,800
It isn't that, it's just that I...

341
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,400
It's when I...

342
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,700
I'm afraid,
I'll start crying and...

343
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,500
disgrace you.

344
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
I don't get this.

345
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,600
Neither do I.

346
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,600
It isn't that we were
ever in love.

347
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,000
After all those years at school
and you used to stick pins at me.

348
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,700
Because you had to
practice on somebody.

349
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,100
Now, listen, Taffy.

350
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,040
Bobby, I don't know
what's the matter with me.

351
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,720
I've never felt like this before.

352
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,500
You've been working too hard.

353
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,880
Look, I know how busy you always are.

354
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
But you just got to
come to this wedding.

355
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,700
You're the only glamour
I know.

356
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,300
If you just heard Cynthia's mother.

357
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,700
"My son-in-law, Dr Campbell,
is a very close friend of Irene Malvern.

358
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,800
As a matter of fact,
she came to the wedding.

359
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,600
She tells me
she cried real tears.

360
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,000
Doesn't use glycerin."

361
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,100
Never touched the filthy stuff.

362
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,900
- All right, I'll come.
- Good.

363
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,900
Oh glory be! Thanks a lot, Taffy.
See you tomorrow.

364
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,800
- Excuse me, Miss Malvern,
are you going out tonight?
- No, Anna.

365
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,300
- Is here something
I can do for you, Madam?
- No, thank you.

366
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,100
It's a beautiful evening, Madam.

367
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
Yes, it is.

368
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,700
Hello?

369
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,300
Miss Smith?

370
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,700
The public stenographer?

371
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,200
No, Miss Malvern
has changed her mind.

372
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
Thank you very much.

373
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,700
She changed her mind.

374
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,000
You know that's where
I'm going to be.

375
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,700
Sorry, I can't come to work today,
changed my mind.

376
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,100
Sorry, I can't pay
the rent today.

377
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,900
I've changed my mind.

378
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,600
Gee, what a life
she must lead!

379
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,900
She's got everything!

380
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,100
She can go anywhere,
do anything,

381
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,900
buy anything.

382
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,700
Stop drooling.

383
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,320
Well, I'd better take
these reports to Dr Campbell

384
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,700
before I start Mr. Edley's notes.

385
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,900
What did Mr. Edley have to say
this time?

386
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,800
He asked me if I knew
what a Park Avenue apartment cost.

387
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,400
- What did you say?
- I said, well, I wasn't a real estate agent.

388
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,700
- What did he say?
- He said "What are you doing tonight?"

389
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,700
Oh, I know the answer
to that one:

390
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,100
"I'm sorry, but
I'm working tonight."

391
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,600
- Say, Kate.
- Yes?

392
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,200
What does
a Park Avenue apartment cost?

393
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, I just wanted to know.

394
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,700
Public stenographer's office.

395
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,000
Dr. Campbell?

396
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
She's on her way
up to you right now.

397
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,900
Thank you.

398
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
You can finish dressing now, Hollis,
I'll be back in a moment.

399
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,500
OK, doc.

400
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,080
- Here's your reports, doctor.
- Fine.

401
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,200
- And your book.
- Would you have time
to take a letter for me?

402
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,300
Yes, sir.

403
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,800
I want this to go air-mail
special delivery.

404
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,100
To Colonel Ralph Whitaker.
W- H-I-T-A-K-E-R.

405
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,900
Walter Reed Hospital,
Washington DC. Dear Ralph:

406
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,400
Pursuant to your request, I have
again examined Captain James Hollis

407
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,700
- Captain James...
- Captain James Hollis.

408
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,500
and his X-ray plates.

409
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,400
I am flattered you wanted me
to confirm your findings,

410
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,800
and I must say
that I agree with them entirely.

411
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,900
When I was still in the army
attached to Halloween,

412
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,000
we had a somewhat similar case,
and as you remember,

413
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,300
we barely pulled
that boy through.

414
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,300
This one is in even
more hazardous risk.

415
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,600
Nevertheless,
the operation that you plan for Tuesday

416
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
can be a success, if...
underline "if"...

417
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,000
the patient
has the will to live.

418
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,100
But actually, his present
state of mind

419
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,000
leaves much to be desired.

420
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,800
Excuse me.

421
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,100
Doctor Campbell.

422
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,800
Hello, Cynthia.

423
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,600
I'm dictating a letter, darling.

424
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
Is she pretty?
I haven't the faintest idea.

425
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,900
Yes, very.

426
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,400
Yes, Irene's coming.
I had quite a time persuading her.

427
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,100
I don't know why.
I'm a bit worried about it,
as a matter of fact.

428
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,500
Yes, darling.

429
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's see, where were we?

430
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,300
Doc, I'm all ready.

431
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,600
Excuse me.

432
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,100
Put on the line, Doc,
what are my chances?

433
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, I'm not going to pretend
that a shrapnel fragment

434
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
in your heart,
is a minor operation.

435
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,200
But you are in awfully good hands.

436
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,000
Colonel Whitaker is first rate,
one of the best.

437
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,800
He's had a lot of success
with the new technique,
but he just wanted me to check.

438
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,600
Well, I'd just like to know
if this is to be
my last week-end, because

439
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,300
Well, I'd just like to know.

440
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,100
You have no family, have you?

441
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,500
No.

442
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,700
Haven't you any close friends?

443
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,600
Yes, my navigator.

444
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,500
But he's dead.

445
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,600
He didn't have to go up with me,
he'd done all his missions.

446
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,300
But I asked him to.

447
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,900
Come on, Doc, let's have it.

448
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,200
Hollis, you got an even chance, but...

449
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,040
but doctors
can't give you the will to live.

450
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,600
Well, I've got me the will
to have one win of a week-end.

451
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,500
I've got me a room here at the Waldorf
I've got a lot of flying pay.

452
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,400
I'd take it easy
if I were you.

453
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,500
Won't you, Doc?

454
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,200
- Thanks, Doc.
- Good luck.

455
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,000
Excuse me, sir.

456
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,600
One moment, please,
I would like to go up again.

457
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,000
I forgot something.

458
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,900
- Would you mind?
- No, go ahead. I've got time.

459
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,900
Thank you.

460
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,500
Lots of time.

461
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,700
Thank you.

462
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,300
- Anna.
- Yes, Madam?

463
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,200
I thought you'd gone.

464
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,280
Forgot to leave the key.

465
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,500
Well, you could've left it at the desk.

466
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
Well, I wanted to leave it
with you here.

467
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,800
So clumsy of me!

468
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Anna, what's the matter?

469
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,600
- I...
- Come here.

470
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,200
Yes, Madam.

471
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,300
- What's come on you, Anna?
- I've got something to tell you.

472
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Well, I shouldn't be
worrying you with this.

473
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,400
- I should be going to the police.
- The police?

474
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,000
But I can't do this to him.
I love him.

475
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,000
And I know he's been
making love to me
to get to you.

476
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,600
To your jewels.

477
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,700
Anna, will you please stop sniveling
and make sense?

478
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,800
He wanted me
to meet him tonight

479
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,000
and give him the key
so he could get
in your apartment.

480
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,300
He must have money,
a great deal of money by Monday.

481
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,800
Of course, the only sensible thing
is to call the police.

482
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,200
Oh, no!

483
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,600
Oh please, Madam,
I would rather die.

484
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,720
I've been with you for 5 years.

485
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,200
If you have any feeling for me...

486
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,200
Of course, Anna,
you know I'm fond of you.

487
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,400
It isn't as if he was just a thief.
It's only the big idea
took hold of him.

488
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,900
The jewels.

489
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,800
I tried to reason with him,
but it's like an obsession.

490
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
But if you talked to him...

491
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,200
You want me to talk to him?

492
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,300
Please, Madam.
He worships you.

493
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,240
He says you are his
favourite actress.

494
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
And yet he wants
to steal my jewels.

495
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,400
I know it isn't logical.

496
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,640
But if you talked to him
he would see that.

497
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,960
You are so convincing,
so charming.

498
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,160
He respects you.

499
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,000
And Madam,
if he would give up this idea,
we could be happy.

500
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,200
I am not pleading
just for him.

501
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,500
I'm pleasing for my life.

502
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,400
- Anna.
- Yes, Madam.

503
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,520
During the 5 years
you've been with me

504
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,440
you've seen me handle
a good many people.

505
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
I haven't been too stupid.

506
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,000
I've always said,
Madam is not only talented,

507
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,100
but with a marvelous brain
and such a good heart.

508
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,900
- You trust my judgment?
- But of course, Madam.

509
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,000
Then give the key
to your young man.

510
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,400
- Let him come tonight.
- You will see him?

511
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
In 10 minutes I'll know
whether he's worth saving.

512
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,400
But I can't receive him in this.

513
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,100
I've got to wear something severe,
something black.

514
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,500
Madam, he's very
fond of blue.

515
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,080
In that case
I shall wear black. This.

516
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,760
- Shall I help you dress Madam?
- No, never mind, Anna.

517
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,720
- Good night...
- I understand, you are spending
the night with your aunt?

518
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,900
Yes, but I was supposed
to give my man the key first.

519
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,800
Go ahead, and give it to him.

520
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,700
Yes. He said he would meet me
a little while somewhere in the lobby.

521
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,000
- Good night, Madam.
- Good night, Anna.

522
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,100
- Anna.
- Yes, Madam.

523
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,400
- You forgot the key.
- Ah, yes, Madam.

524
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

525
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,300
Would you please give me
the hotel police?

526
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,100
Yes, Miss Malvern.

527
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,500
- Blake.
- Yes.

528
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,900
Get up to Miss Malvern's apartment,
she'll tell you what it's all about.

529
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
- She doesn't want to talk
over the telephone.- OK.

530
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
- And report back here.
- Yes, sir.

531
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,300
Yes, sir?

532
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm Captain Hollis,
I'm up in 2318.

533
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,000
I know it sounds
kind of wacky to you,
but the fact is I've lost a song.

534
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,600
- You lost what?
- Song. Music.

535
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,400
I've lost it between
Dr. Campbell's apartment and my room.

536
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
Just a minute.

537
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,400
- Lost and found.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,300
Chief Jennings's talking.

539
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,000
There's a guest here
lost a song.

540
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,600
- A song?
- Yes, music.

541
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,300
Oh yes, the floor waiter found it
and he took it to Mr. Cugat.

542
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,200
- He did?
- Yes, sir.

543
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,520
Floor waiter found it.
Thought it was Xavier Cugat's.

544
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,200
He's always losing something.
We'll get it for you.

545
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,800
I wonder if Mr. Cugat will let me
try to get it myself?

546
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,700
- It's very important.
- OK.

547
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,000
- Thanks.
- The 11th floor, Room 1110.

548
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,300
All right.

549
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,200
- You're fired.
- Fired? I quit!

550
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,100
Excuse me.

551
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,000
And what do you want?

552
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm sorry to barge in
this way Mr. Cugat.

553
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,000
but I was told
you have some music
that belongs to me.

554
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,900
- Music?
- Yes, the floor waiter brought it
here by mistake.

555
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,500
Music? Sure I have music!

556
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,000
I have them by the pounds,
by the tons, by the inch

557
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,000
by the yards, by the miles.

558
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,400
What kind of music?

559
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,200
I have tangos, boleros,
sambas, congas,

560
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,500
bossas, fox-trots,

561
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,900
concertos, cantatas,
overtures.

562
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,100
It was a ballad.

563
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,780
A ballad! Look,
I'm a very very busy man.

564
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,000
I have problems, I have responsibilities.

565
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,900
Why do you annoy me,
why do you confuse me?

566
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,300
Mr. Cugat.
I  had some music manuscript.

567
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,240
I lost it.

568
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,720
The floor waiter picked it up
he brought it here.
He thought it was yours.

569
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,240
Well, I don't know anything about it.

570
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,700
I have enough problems
keeping track of my musicians,

571
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,640
without bothering about floor waiters.

572
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,160
I'm not a Maître d'Hotel.

573
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,600
- Do you mind if I look for it?
- Certainly, I mind.

574
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,880
You're a flier, not a composer,
why are you doing with music, anyway?

575
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,800
It doesn't happen to be mine.

576
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,200
It was written by a buddy of mine.
He was shot down over Formosa.

577
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,500
I want to send it to his mother.

578
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,960
It was all that was left of him
except a couple of snapshots.

579
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,880
- Now, do you mind
if I look for it?
- Mind?

580
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,200
Certainly not!
I'll look for it myself.

581
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,200
I'll turn this place upside down.

582
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,800
Why didn't you say
you were looking for some music

583
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,500
instead of talking about...

584
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,800
floor waiters?
What's this?

585
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,160
- That's it, that's it! What a relief!
- That's it?

586
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,500
"And there you are".
Nice title.

587
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,400
Now, let's see.

588
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,500
Not bad, not bad.

589
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,800
<i>You're never out</i>

590
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,700
<i> of my heart.</i>

591
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,100
Yes, pretty nice.

592
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,000
We liked it.

593
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,400
Certainly, we would like
anything out there.

594
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,500
Well.

595
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,400
- Has she got a radio?
- Who?

596
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,700
- This man's mother.
- Oh, I guess so.

597
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
We'll broadcast from 9 to 10
tomorrow night. Tell her to listen.

598
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,240
- You mean you'll play it?
- On the "Starlight Roof".

599
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
- Tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night?

600
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,520
I suppose you want me
to play it tonight?

601
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,280
We have to rehearse the new numbers,

602
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,300
you got to argue
with your musicians,

603
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,300
find them, humble them,
scream at them,

604
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,200
flatter them, curse them,
praise them, beat them.

605
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,500
If you think that you
put on a number
just like that

606
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,500
and seize it?

607
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,720
Did you see the girl
who just left here?

608
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,500
I've fired her!

609
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,100
Now I'm gonna take her back, she'll resign,
I'll accept, she'll refuse,

610
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,100
she'll come back, she'll go...
No, I can't play it tonight.

611
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,800
- What?
- Tomorrow night.

612
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,700
I'm sorry, Mr. Cugat.

613
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,500
I got time.

614
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,600
Lots of time.

615
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,500
- Mr. Collyer?
- No.

616
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,000
That's fine,
but this is your room,
you look like you.

617
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,640
- Are you a linguist?
- Yes, sir.

618
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,300
I took Spanish,
French, Italian in college.

619
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,720
How about English?

620
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,000
I speak English,
all my life.

621
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,800
How's your vision?

622
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,560
I just wear these to appear dignified.
I got 20/20 eyes.

623
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,800
Really?
Well, read those signs then.

624
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Do not disturb.

625
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,700
Non disturbate.

626
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,800
- I don't seem
to know those languages.
- What the heck do you want?

627
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,600
My name is  Oliver Webson,
the boss sent me down here
to cover the Edley story.

628
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,600
He said it I ran in any trouble
you'll help me out.

629
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,920
- Ah, he did?
- Yes, sir.

630
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,300
- So you are a reporter.
- Yes, sir.

631
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,900
Now I know what they mean
by the acute manpower shortage.

632
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,100
May I come in?

633
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,360
Yes, come on
and make it quick.

634
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,500
- Thank you.
- Now what is it?

635
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,700
The  Edley story, the boss said
you'd be interested.

636
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,500
What have you got so far?

637
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,200
You know, we got
a cable from Cairo

638
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,100
saying that the Bey of Aribajan
was going to lease out some oil.

639
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,600
The boss found out
that the Bey was staying
right here at the hotel.

640
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Furthermore, the boss found out

641
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,400
that Edley is negotiating
with the Bey.

642
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,000
- He is?
- Yes.

643
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,500
Boss says
it's a very bad thing for the country,

644
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,000
see, because this contract
starts after the war.

645
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,000
And the boss has got an idea
with all that Nazi and jap money...

646
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,760
That...

647
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,500
Well, I haven't got it
quite straight but,

648
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,000
anyway the boss says
it's a bad thing for the country.

649
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,900
Anything that Edley is in
is a bad thing for the country.

650
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,800
So far you've told me
what the boss has found out.

651
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,300
What did you find out?

652
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,100
Nothing.

653
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,600
What did you do?

654
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,100
Well, I've found
the Bey's suite.

655
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,600
Say, do you know
he's got a goat?

656
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,300
He drinks goat's milk.

657
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,100
- Did you see him?
- Oh, sure.

658
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,880
- The goat or the Bey?
- The goat.

659
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,300
Did you go to the Bey?

660
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,300
Well, the Bey sent word
he was tired.

661
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,500
- Did you try Edley?
- Said he wasn't in.

662
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,700
I see.

663
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,100
Say, could I have a drink?
I've had a tough day.

664
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,700
Sure, that won't dull
that keen edge

665
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,360
to that razor-like mind of yours.

666
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,500
Oh, no!

667
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,400
Well, so far you have tried
the conventional legitimate ways

668
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,040
of approaching the victim.
Now you've got to try the illegitimate.

669
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,800
- How?
- Edley won't tell you anything.

670
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,300
Concentrate on the Bey,
you've gotta see him.

671
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,000
- But how?
- Figure out a way.

672
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,800
Listen,

673
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,800
the Bey's suite's
right next to yours, see?

674
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,900
Now if I could figure out some way

675
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,700
to sneak out on the face terrace

676
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
from here..

677
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,800
Of course, that's not for jump.

678
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,300
You see? First you have to enter
the Bey's room,

679
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,400
but to get to the Bey's room,
I don't need the terrace.

680
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,760
Boy, you're hotter than
a  firecracker on the 5th of July.

681
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,400
Who is it?

682
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,500
Maid.

683
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,900
- I beg your pardon.
I just wanted only...
- Don't bother now.

684
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,800
Very well, I'll go to the next one
and come back later.

685
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,600
- Just a minute.
You might as well go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

686
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,600
-Where did you say
the Bey's rooms were?
- Next door, on the corner.

687
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,700
- The maid's heading there,
you heard her, didn't you?
- Yeah.

688
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,300
Suppose, you get in there.

689
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,500
- It's your chance
to sneak in that way.
- I can't do that.

690
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,400
- Why not?
- I'd feel silly.

691
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,000
Yes, of course you'd feel silly,
but you'll get there.

692
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,080
It isn't dignified.
Besides, I wouldn't fit.

693
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
Look, I'm bigger than you,
and I'd fit in there.

694
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,400
- I 'd like to see you try it.
- Well, I'll show you.

695
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,000
Then you pull them over like that.

696
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,440
You can't see me, can you?

697
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,400
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

698
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,400
Good night.

699
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,000
- Wait a minute.
- Yes, sir?

700
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't...

701
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,500
- Never mind.
- Yes, sir.

702
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,640
His Highness hasn't had time
to study the proposal,

703
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400
- It's a very serious and important matter.
- Yes, but you see, on the other hand...

704
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,700
What's that?

705
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,600
Any trouble?

706
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm the maid,
I was just trying to explain...

707
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,600
Ah, it's quite all right.
Thank you very much but....

708
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,720
His Highness is served entirely
by his own staff, you see.

709
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,000
- Oh! I'm sorry. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

710
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,100
Night maid,  Miss Malvern.

711
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,680
- What can I do? He wants
some time to think it over.

712
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,720
- I'd make a subcontract.

713
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
- I'll put it down in the morning.
- Maybe.

714
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,900
You just watch me.

715
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,300
It's very nice of you to come up.

716
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,800
- Sorry you wouldn't tell me
more about it, Miss Malvern.
- I'd rather not.

717
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,880
Anyhow, I'd see that these are going
in the safe in the main office.

718
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,400
- Thank you very much.
- And then I'll stay around.

719
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,400
- Good night.
- Good night.

720
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,700
- Good night, Miss Malvern.
- Good night.

721
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,900
- Good evening.
- Nice night, eh?

722
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,400
Well, now that you're here you...

723
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,400
you may as well come in.

724
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,900
I must say you

725
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,700
did it rather skillfully.

726
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,200
Well, well. Irene Malvern.

727
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
It's along way from Italy.

728
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,900
You know, you gave
a swell performance for me,

729
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,600
one night at Sovana.
Me and  5.000 GIs

730
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,100
The film broke a couple of times
but it was swell.

731
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,900
You'll never know
what you did to me that night.

732
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,800
What are you looking for?

733
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,200
- Cigarettes, but...
- There are some right there.
- Thank you.

734
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,480
I can explain this.

735
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,200
Anna has already explained

736
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,800
- Anna?
- Yes, Anna.

737
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,200
You took a mean advantage
of a poor devoted soul.

738
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,500
Did I?

739
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,880
Well...

740
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,800
Look.

741
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,700
I am a newspaper man,

742
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,240
and I wouldn't be
in this charming predicament

743
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,700
if I weren't half asleep.

744
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,300
Go on.

745
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,800
Well I was trying to...

746
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,760
show a silly cub
how to get a certain story.

747
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,900
The story I'd like
cut in incidentally.

748
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,400
Go on.

749
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,000
There it is. This, of course,
wasn't my destination.

750
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,600
When you came in,
I was

751
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,400
retreating
to shorten the line.

752
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,800
Go on.

753
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,000
It's been the communiqué.

754
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,400
You are not very clever now.

755
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,600
No,
I have my off moments,

756
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,100
and this is one.

757
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,480
Got a match?

758
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,300
- A lighter.
- Thank you.

759
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
Say, it's a handsome little piece.

760
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,500
- Now where were we?
- May I?

761
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

762
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,400
You just can't help
taking things, can you?

763
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,800
Look, Miss Malvern,
you've got me all wrong.

764
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,280
I know it's a bit complicated,
but if you pay attention
I'll diagram it for you.

765
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,400
Anna has already done that.

766
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, back to Anna again.

767
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,200
Yes,

768
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,320
she told me everything.

769
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,100
- She did?
- Yes.

770
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,000
I can better understand her now.

771
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,300
You can?

772
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,500
I do well understand it.

773
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,840
Have you any love her at all?

774
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,440
Over...

775
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,400
You know how it is.

776
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,080
She was only a means to an end, eh?

777
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,700
- Did she say that?
- Oh, not in those words.

778
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,600
As a matter of fact, she
didn't make very much sense.

779
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,000
She was hysterical.

780
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,500
And I can understand that, too.

781
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,440
After all, you have been
using your wiles on her
for some time now.

782
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,100
And why?

783
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,440
To get my jewels.

784
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,960
Oh I see.

785
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,600
Let me assure you
my jewels are downstairs,
in the vault.

786
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,900
Ah, in that case...

787
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,360
And furthermore,
let me assure you
that there's a detective

788
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,500
standing outside that door.

789
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,440
Perry Mason, Peter Wimsy,
o Sherlock Holmes?

790
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,900
Do you want to go to prison?

791
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,200
That's an experience
I've  never really had.

792
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,800
So you are sensations eager.
Is that it?

793
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,200
That's it.

794
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,200
If I wanted jewelry,

795
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,700
would I be sitting here
with one of the loveliest women in America

796
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,920
watching her green-flecked eyes

797
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,500
change from fear to scorn,

798
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,300
to anger, to pity?

799
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,800
Oh yes, I saw
some pity in those eyes.

800
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,240
And while we are on the subject,

801
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,500
if you don't mind my saying so,

802
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,920
that's the nicest hank of hair
I've seen in many a lonesome month.

803
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,120
And the nose

804
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,800
isn't bad either.

805
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,100
But do you know
what gets me? The voice.

806
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,800
There's music in it.

807
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,100
Poor Anna.

808
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,600
She never had a chance,
did she?

809
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,300
Not a chance.

810
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,900
- Anything else, sir?
- No, thanks.

811
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,500
Say, waiter.

812
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,700
- Did you ever make out a will?
- Can't say I have.

813
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,300
But I had and aunt who did.

814
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,000
Lived in a big house
in Brooklyn, with 20 cats.

815
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,100
Every month
she changed her will,

816
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,100
and every month the whole family
had to go out and hear her reading.

817
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,600
And in the end,

818
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,300
you know who got the money?

819
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,900
The cats.

820
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,000
How do you start?
I mean, how do you go about it?

821
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,100
Search me.

822
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,600
But I'll tell you who can
put you right on that.

823
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,900
The public stenographer
right here in the hotel.

824
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,200
- She is supposed to know everything.
- Thanks.

825
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,400
And maybe she will
have it notarized,
you know?

826
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,600
- By a notary public.
- OK.

827
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,900
Thank you, sir.

828
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,700
Listen to this:
"14 rooms, 5 baths,

829
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,300
solarium, terrace,

830
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,400
one of New York's most exclusive
Park Avenue residences.

831
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,700
14.000 dollars annually."

832
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,900
- What? No bowling alley?
- No.

833
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,500
- Good night.
- Good night.

834
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,300
Excuse me.

835
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,320
I wonder if you could tell me where

836
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,960
I can find a Notary Public?

837
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,200
Well, I am one.

838
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,000
You are?

839
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,040
I thought you'd be sort of a

840
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,300
older gent with glasses
and false teeth that click

841
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,900
and a black string tie.

842
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,800
He forecloses mortgages.

843
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,900
Notary Public can be the male or female
over 21, must be bonded,

844
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,600
must have stamp,

845
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,500
stamp pad
and must never
have the license run out.

846
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,200
Now have you any identification?

847
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,600
- My dog tag any good?
- Well..

848
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,700
I see you got one, too.

849
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,900
Bunny

850
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,100
Bunny.

851
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,600
A silly name, isn't it?
I was christened ...

852
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,600
Bernaradine, but I never could pronounce
the darned thing, and still can't.

853
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,600
When I was a kid,
they'd always ask me
"What's your name",

854
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,800
I would say: "My name is Bunny."

855
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,200
Say that again.

856
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,700
My name..

857
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,400
Now have you any identification

858
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,200
with a signature already on it?

859
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,000
Well you see, I need that
for my own protection.

860
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,000
Oh, let me see.

861
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,900
Something with my
picture on it, maybe.

862
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,900
Ah, yeah.

863
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,400
That's me,
Captain James Hollis.

864
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,400
Right, Captain James...

865
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,100
- Captain James Hollis?
- Yes.

866
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,400
They forgot to make me a general.
Just an oversight.

867
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,800
Now what would you like
to have motorized?

868
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,300
My will.

869
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,300
- A will?
- Yes.

870
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,400
- Well...
- There it is.

871
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,500
Is that it?

872
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,500
Sure, isn't that legal?

873
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,200
Well, it's legal,
but it isn't legible.

874
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,300
Besides, wills don't
have to be notarized.

875
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,400
- They don't?
- No.

876
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,900
All you need are
two witnesses.

877
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,100
You see? They sign there and...

878
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,000
you sign here.

879
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,000
Suppose, I copy it first.

880
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,300
You're pretty business-like, aren't you?

881
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,000
One has to be in my business.

882
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,800
That'd break your heart.

883
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,600
Now, let's see.

884
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,100
"I leave my Air Medal to..."

885
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,500
- What's the name?
- Mrs. Hannah Slacken.

886
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,300
- Of...
- Jasmond, California.
- I see.

887
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,600
- Relation?
- My landlady.

888
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,400
- "I leave my..." what is this?
- Uniforms.

889
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,700
to...

890
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,100
Cadet John Mickels.

891
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,700
- Address.
- Kittle Center. San Antonio.

892
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,400
I see. Relation?

893
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,180
No. Just a fellow
I went to school with.

894
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,000
One guy that always wrote to me.

895
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,300
"I leave my..."

896
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,300
I leave my motorcycle
to Harry Clark of

897
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,100
Jasmond, California,

898
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,000
to be held in trust for him
until he reaches the age of

899
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,280
60.

900
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,900
It's in Joe Bonny's garage.

901
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,300
He always wanted that cheer-up.

902
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,500
You want me to put all that in?

903
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,360
Yes, I guess so. Yeah!

904
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,200
Do you really think
he can wait 50 years
for that motorcycle?

905
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,300
Oh I don't know
what I'm doing.

906
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,120
The trouble with me is that
I wanted to get home for a year.

907
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,800
I get home...

908
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,400
Well, I have no.

909
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,400
I see.

910
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,000
I sold my gas-station
before I went to the air-force.

911
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,700
That was home to me.

912
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,100
- It was a really good station, too.
- Really?

913
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:30,900
Yes.

914
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,200
A dog, and a cat,
and some bees.

915
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,600
-Everybody in  Jasmond has bees.
- Bees!

916
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,000
They don't bother you,
once they get to know you.

917
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,100
Like people, eh?

918
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,100
Where are you from?

919
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,600
- You won't tell?
- No, promise.

920
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,900
Well, I was born in New York,
on 10th Avenue.

921
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,800
We called it "double Fifth".

922
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,000
I think I know
that street.

923
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,400
Well, you haven't missed anything,
it's no Park Avenue.

924
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,500
Mamma would say we'd move
some day but we didn't.

925
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,200
You like Park Avenue?

926
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,900
Well, I like what it means.

927
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,500
What does it mean?

928
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,000
That I'm on my way.

929
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,400
Where are you heading for?

930
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,000
As far away from double 5th
as I can get.

931
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,300
Look.

932
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,300
I've got a whole week-end,
and I don't know a soul.

933
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,800
What are you doing tonight?

934
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,200
Nothing. I was supposed to work.

935
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,400
A conference, you know.
But it was postponed
until tomorrow.

936
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Excuse me.

937
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,680
Public steno....

938
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,400
Yes, Mr. Edley.

939
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,900
Yes, I can come up.

940
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,900
At the Bey's apartment.

941
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,400
Very well.

942
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,600
I have this wrong,
the conference is on again.

943
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,900
What about tomorrow?
You don't have to work
on Saturday, too?

944
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,600
Not if I can help it.
Not on Saturday night.

945
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,000
I thought it was
a big night for me, too.

946
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,400
Even if I only went down
to the drug-store.

947
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,160
Look, you go about your schedule,
and I'll follow it.

948
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,100
- All right.
- It will be my last
Saturday night

949
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,200
in town.

950
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,300
The only thing is
we've got to be at the "Star Light Roof"
from 9 to 10.

951
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,600
- The "Star Light Roof"?
- Yeah, I've never been there.

952
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,900
Gee, neither have I.

953
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,100
- What about the will?
- Oh, we've got time for that.

954
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,300
Sure, lots of time.

955
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,700
- Then this is a date?
- Absolutely.

956
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,040
That's wonderful.

957
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,800
Do you like
crêpes Suzette?

958
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,300
What's that?
Sounds like a shirt.

959
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,600
That's French for pancakes.

960
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,300
We'll have them,
even if they are shirts.

961
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,500
- Well, see you tomorrow.
- OK.

962
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,100
- Hi, what's up?
- Routine.

963
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,100
But what made you a thief?

964
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,900
Oh, that's a long story.

965
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,300
Is it hereditary?

966
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,200
No, my father was a missionary.

967
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,700
- Oh, a good man!
- None better.

968
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,000
Eh...when did you
first...?

969
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,000
- Steal?
- Yes.

970
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,520
Well, let's not go into that.

971
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,900
Anyway, why are you taking
all this trouble over me?

972
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,720
You're a movie star.

973
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
You ought to be at El Morocco,
or some place,

974
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,600
getting yourself photographed,
danced with, engaged,
married, divorced.

975
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,100
Incidentally,
are you engaged,

976
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,000
married, divorced?

977
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,400
No, no, no.

978
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,700
How come?

979
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,000
I work.

980
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,200
That's something
I recommend to you - work.

981
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,920
The only thing in life.

982
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,100
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

983
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,200
Well, the only
satisfying thing.

984
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,400
I wouldn't say that either.

985
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,600
What else is there, then?

986
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,600
Well, there's... fishing.

987
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,500
You're a pretty lonely soul,
aren't you?

988
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,500
- What makes you say that?
- And frightened, too.

989
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,900
- Of you?
- Oh, no! Not of me.

990
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,200
Of life.

991
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,900
I'm not afraid
of anything or anybody.

992
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,100
I am.

993
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,300
Most people with any sense
are one time or other.

994
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,800
I don't understand you.

995
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,200
What is it
you're after anyway?

996
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,920
You've got looks, success,
a dizzy amount of it,
from what I can make out.

997
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,800
A hundred million women would
trample each other to pieces
to change places with you.

998
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,120
Yet, coming back to your eyes, which

999
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,400
certainly fascinate me,

1000
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,800
there's something missing.

1001
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,400
I am very happy.

1002
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,900
What's more, we are not here
to discuss me.

1003
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,100
I realize that's a subtle
form of flattery but ...

1004
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,800
I assure you,
I'm on to it.

1005
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,440
- I can't get around you, can I?
- Not very easily.

1006
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,500
All right. Show down.
I'm the parasite.

1007
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,000
Not a bad fellow.

1008
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,000
Good manners, gentleman.

1009
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,400
They call me the Baron.

1010
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,100
- Who's they?
- The gang.

1011
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,200
- You mean you work with a gang?
- Well, syndicate, if you prefer.

1012
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,700
Then this whole thing
has been carefully organized.

1013
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,900
Meticulously.

1014
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,700
What are you going
to tell the syndicate?

1015
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,500
If I should let you go.

1016
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,700
That I couldn't pull the job.
Met my intended victim

1017
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,440
she was beautiful, she was warm,
she was generous, sincere...

1018
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,000
I still had a little
spark of decency left, so

1019
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,700
I returned the necklace.

1020
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,300
What necklace?

1021
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,900
The  Grand Duke's.

1022
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,760
"Grand Hotel".

1023
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,200
That's straight out of the picture
"Grand Hotel".

1024
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,100
That's right, I am the Baron,
you are the ballerina,

1025
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,720
and we're off to see the wizard.

1026
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,100
How very amusing!

1027
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,100
Look.

1028
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,000
Do you still believe
I'm a jewel thief?

1029
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,200
But if you aren't
why did ask Anna for the key?

1030
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,300
Can't you guess?

1031
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,200
Why, that's the most
outrageous.

1032
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,000
- I think you'd better go.
- Sorry?

1033
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,000
Your necklace.

1034
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,700
You were quite right about me.

1035
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,900
But I'm not the same man
who came in here.

1036
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,900
Won't you believe that?

1037
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,300
Well..

1038
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:20,800
Wait.

1039
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,300
Do the police know you by sight?

1040
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,300
There's not a cop in New York
who doesn't.

1041
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,700
Wait here, then. I'll

1042
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,700
get rid of the detective.

1043
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,600
Lexington 20598.

1044
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,000
Mr. Johns, please.

1045
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
But I tell you,
you can go now.

1046
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,800
I'm sorry, Miss Malvern,
but the chief left strict orders
I wasn't to move away from this floor.

1047
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,000
- We are not taking any chances.
- I asked for you myself,

1048
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,800
and now I'm asking
you to leave.

1049
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,300
Well, Ma'am,
I 'm going off at midnight.

1050
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,520
Ah, that's good!

1051
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,000
But another man's relieving me,
and I will be back in the morning.

1052
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,500
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

1053
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,000
Don't tell me
I'm the only man who can...

1054
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,300
Listen, I'm through,
I tell you.

1055
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,600
Well. I was in \\\,
in the first place.

1056
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,100
I don't care
what's at stake.

1057
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,800
You can count me out, yes.

1058
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
That was the gang.

1059
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,500
Well, you're in.

1060
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,900
And now, good night.

1061
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,200
You can't go yet,
the detective won't budge an inch.

1062
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,100
I'm going to call the chief.

1063
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,300
Would you give me the chief
of protection service, please.

1064
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,900
Sorry, I'm such a bother.

1065
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,700
This is Miss Malvern.
Would you remove that detective?

1066
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,400
Oh, no.
He is very nice.

1067
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,400
It's just that
he's pacing up and down,

1068
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,300
it makes me very nervous.

1069
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,200
What did he say?

1070
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,200
Even if he does stop
pacing up and down

1071
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,500
it's just his being there.

1072
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,600
But after all, I' don't need
anyone to guard me.

1073
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,400
What's that?

1074
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,100
He's not there just to guard me,
he's guarding the Bey?

1075
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,400
What Bay?

1076
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,040
"Bay" is a body of water

1077
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,100
almost entirely
surrounded by land.

1078
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,700
Oh, I see.

1079
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,600
Thank you.

1080
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,700
Well...

1081
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,500
There's only one thing to do, ey?

1082
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,400
- What's that?
- Stay here.

1083
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,000
Here?

1084
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,600
I hate to impose
upon you, I realize

1085
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,040
that you hardly know me,
that you have no reason to trust me, however...

1086
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,300
- And where do you
propose to sleep?
- Right here

1087
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,400
In the living-room, of course.

1088
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,500
All I need is
a blanket or something.

1089
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Wait just a moment!

1090
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,100
Calm down, Miss Malvern!
You've done this before.

1091
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,700
- I have?
- In one of your pictures.

1092
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,600
- But that was acting.
- And this is real life, eh?

1093
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,600
That'll be fine.
A little cold,
but that's all right.

1094
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,900
- Do you mind?
- I certainly do.

1095
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,400
Very well, then.

1096
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,100
Call the police.

1097
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,500
Wait.

1098
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,300
All right, go ahead.

1099
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,100
So, Miss Malvern,
good night.

1100
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,300
You...

1101
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,900
didn't lock the door?

1102
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,640
There's no lock.

1103
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,200
Good night.

1104
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,300
What are you doing?

1105
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,000
I once walked in the sleep.

1106
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,000
<i>Saturday morning the sun rose
in its accustomed place.</i>

1107
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,900
<i>behind the Waldorf's towers.</i>

1108
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,900
<i>It's really quite a sight,
if you are not too sleepy
to appreciate it.</i>

1109
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,000
<i>Early morning in a big hotel
is quite a sight anyway.</i>

1110
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,700
<i>People cleaning windows
just as they do in New-York
or Kansas-City,</i>

1111
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,800
<i>except that the soap has a little
farther to fall.</i>

1112
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,000
<i>I don't know what the people
behind these windows are thinking.</i>

1113
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
<i>This Saturday morning
they aren't thinking anything at all,
most likely.</i>

1114
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,000
<i>But before long
they will all be struggling
out of bed</i>

1115
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,400
<i>peering out the seam of the day
is going to be like and</i>

1116
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,080
<i>and going right back to bed again.</i>

1117
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,880
<i>However some people
have to get up,
and  even the sidewalk</i>

1118
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,700
<i>comes in for its morning shampoo</i>

1119
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,900
<i>What appears to be a hockey team
ready for scrimmage is merely a crew</i>

1120
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,800
<i>touching up the mosaic floor.</i>

1121
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,900
<i> Waldorf's famous "Wheel of life".</i>

1122
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,000
<i>As in these big lobbies a little later
there'll be the hum of guests and music</i>

1123
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,800
<i>at this hour that hum is
from the dozens of cleaners,</i>

1124
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,800
<i>waxing machines and vacuums.</i>

1125
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,600
<i>The bell boys,</i>

1126
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,640
<i>moving a bit faster
than I, I must admit,</i>

1127
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,900
<i>are standing glove inspection.</i>

1128
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,200
<i>Not rehearsing tip maneuvers,
as you might think.</i>

1129
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,600
<i>Now one of the ledge filled out
the scheduled events for the day</i>

1130
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:29,600
<i>and not one word about Suzy's
checking out for the  Bideawee.</i>

1131
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,800
Good morning, Waldorf Astoria.

1132
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,100
It's 8:55.

1133
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,100
- Waldorf Astoria.
- Astoria Center.

1134
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,600
Room service? Just a moment, please.

1135
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,100
Room service.

1136
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,600
Mr. Edley would like
to have his breakfast
as soon as possible.

1137
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,100
Good morning,  Mrs Drew.

1138
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,800
Mr. Alex, maître d' hotel?
Just a minute please.

1139
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,700
But we talked over the event
yesterday with  Dr. Campbell.

1140
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,300
I know, Alex,

1141
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,300
but doctor Campbell
is a doctor, you see.

1142
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,600
I beg your pardon?

1143
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,600
You want me to put something
medical on the wedding cake?

1144
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:19,000
But Madam, the chef has already put
the flags of United Nations.

1145
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,200
Four Cupids, two Psyches.

1146
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,300
He's outdone himself.

1147
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,500
Well, what have you in mind?

1148
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,700
The Kansas City General Hospital?

1149
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,500
I make her the Kansas City Hospital,

1150
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,800
I'll go to the Kansas
City  Hospital!

1151
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,800
Thank you.

1152
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,500
I knew I could depend on you.

1153
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,700
- Mother.
- Just a moment, dear.

1154
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,300
Alex, will you meet me
in the "Jade Room" at 11 o'clock?

1155
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,500
I want to go over
the floral arrangements with you.

1156
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,500
Here's a wire from the singer
engaged for the wedding.

1157
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,700
She's down with bronchitis
and can't sing.

1158
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,300
Oh, what a nuisance!

1159
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,300
- Cynthia, where are you going?
- Out.

1160
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,301
What on earth for?

1161
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:00,900
Please, Mother dear.

1162
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm just going for a walk in the park.

1163
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,400
- Something I'd like to think about.
- Think?

1164
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,900
What is there to think about
on your wedding day?
Time enough afterwards.

1165
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,400
Afterwards may be too late.

1166
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,500
What am I going to do
about a singer?

1167
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,300
Hallo, will you get me
Mr. Randy Morton, please?

1168
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,700
Yes, Mrs  Drew, just a moment,.

1169
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,800
Miss Malvern? I'm afraid
I can't disturb her.

1170
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,200
Who's calling?

1171
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,200
Her maid? Very well.

1172
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,000
Hello?

1173
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:49,700
Madam, I'm sorry I troubled you
yesterday. It was so unnecessary.

1174
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,300
He has reformed.

1175
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,300
<i>He's here with me now.</i>

1176
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,040
Madam, I was so happy
last night when he decided

1177
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,800
not to go to your apartment.

1178
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,040
Oh that's fine, Anna.

1179
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,500
I'm very glad.

1180
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,800
Good-bye, Anna.

1181
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,400
What?

1182
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:47,100
CHIP COLLYER.
WAR CORRESPONDENT.

1183
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:29,500
Is there a Mr. Chip Collyer
registered here in the hotel?

1184
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,400
Yes, there is, Miss Malvern.

1185
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,000
Shall I ring him?

1186
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,700
Did you say no?

1187
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,400
Mr. Randy Morton?

1188
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,000
Sorry, his line is busy.

1189
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,800
I tell you, Mrs  Drew,

1190
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:43,200
I think your best possibility
is  Mme. Jalaska.

1191
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,600
After all, she was a great singer

1192
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,200
and she's right here
at the hotel.

1193
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,800
Not at all.
Very glad to help you.

1194
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:52,900
Good-bye.

1195
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,600
Time like this!

1196
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,700
Bideawee.

1197
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:00,800
Bideawee.

1198
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,200
How's Suzy?
How's Suzy?

1199
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,600
I thought you were the Bideawee home.

1200
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,000
I've been sitting up
the whole night waiting.

1201
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,900
Yes, Mr. Morton, I know.

1202
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:16,600
It's harder on the man
than it is on the dog.

1203
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,600
Good morning, sir.

1204
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,600
Good morning.

1205
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,200
Yes, I'll send her right off.

1206
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,100
Is there something I can do for you?

1207
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,000
As a matter of fact
I was looking...

1208
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

1209
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,700
- I just wanted to be sure
about tonight.
- Tonight's all right.

1210
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,600
Did you have fun last night?

1211
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:39,100
Yes, I went to the airport
watched the planes come in.

1212
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,100
Well, I just wanted
to be sure about tonight.

1213
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:46,800
It's gonna be something special
and I kinda like
to have you share with me.

1214
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,700
You know about that Cugat tonight?
Want to get you know.

1215
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,900
He's gonna broadcast the song
a friend of mine wrote.

1216
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:54,901
Really?

1217
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,100
- 9 o'clock all right?
- Yes.

1218
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,120
I'll take you up here or shall we meet
right at the Star Light Roof?

1219
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,200
- Star Light Roof.
- Righto.

1220
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,600
What happened to your grand plans?

1221
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,300
The Park Avenue apartment.

1222
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,700
Well you don't have to work
at it all the time.

1223
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,500
Public stenographer's office.

1224
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,600
Bunny?

1225
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,700
Oh, Mr. Edley!
I think she just stepped out.

1226
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,400
Stop protecting me.
Hang up.

1227
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,100
Good morning, Mr. Edley.

1228
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:29,200
Yes. Yes, I can come up.

1229
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,100
All right.

1230
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,400
Who said you don't have
to work at it all the time?

1231
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,700
- Miss Smith.
- Yes?

1232
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,600
You forgot your notebook.

1233
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,700
Are you up and respectable?

1234
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:56,800
Yes.

1235
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,960
Good morning.

1236
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,300
Good morning.

1237
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,000
You didn't have to do that,
you know.

1238
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,300
- Breakfast!
- Don't you think you ought to

1239
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,640
put the furniture back?

1240
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,500
What for? Breakfast?

1241
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,100
Before breakfast.

1242
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:17,600
Right.

1243
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,400
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

1244
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,000
Clear and crisp.

1245
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,160
The kind of a morning that

1246
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,400
sends a man on to his honest labors,
with a song on his lips,

1247
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,800
and a purpose in his heart.

1248
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,600
That is provided
he's had breakfast.

1249
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,000
Why don't you go out
and get yourself some breakfast?

1250
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,800
The detective. You forget
he's still there.

1251
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,200
As big as life.

1252
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,700
What's happened to your eyes?

1253
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,300
They are cold.

1254
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:46,000
Last night they were
filled with pity

1255
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,200
and understanding.

1256
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,700
That was last night.

1257
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,600
This morning came...

1258
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:54,240
what we in the Hollywood
call the dawn.

1259
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,700
Frankly,

1260
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,900
I'm terribly
disappointed in you.

1261
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,700
Well, what have I done?

1262
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,300
It's what you haven't done.

1263
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,100
In Hollywood, Baron,

1264
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,100
when a man says to a woman:

1265
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,100
"Darling, I'm going strait",

1266
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,800
when she wakes up,
he's off someplace
building a dam, or

1267
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,500
running a railroad,
o plugging up a flood.

1268
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,700
What have you done? I've slept.

1269
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,400
Frankly, I'm terribly
disappointed in you.

1270
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,360
- I'll reassure you just as soon
as I have my breakfast.

1271
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,360
- I expected more, from the Baron.

1272
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,200
Oh but wait till I've had my hot cakes.

1273
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,200
So prosaic.

1274
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,200
So un-heroic.

1275
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,100
Hot cakes!

1276
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,200
Irene.

1277
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,300
Yes, Baron.

1278
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,800
Sometimes a man gets himself

1279
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,500
into a situation and

1280
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,100
doesn't know how
to get out of it. Now...

1281
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,500
Very funny.

1282
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,000
I was..

1283
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,300
going to suggest
that you might get out of it

1284
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,600
by going through that door.

1285
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:55,300
I don't think
the detective is still there,

1286
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,700
day shift or night shift.
But if he is,

1287
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,400
I have a feeling that he might
tip his head and say:

1288
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,000
"Good morning, Mr. Collyer."

1289
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,200
And that's my cue to say:

1290
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,100
"Good-bye, Mr. Chip Collyer."

1291
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:15,300
Look.

1292
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:17,900
I apologize.

1293
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,720
I tried to tell you, but
you wanted me to be the Baron.

1294
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,300
Why not?
It was your way.

1295
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,100
The fact is for 10 years
I've been looking for you

1296
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,800
without even knowing it.

1297
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,300
When I saw you, well...
I had to stay.

1298
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,300
I...

1299
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,700
think you'd better go

1300
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,300
and get your hot cakes.

1301
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,300
- Who is it?
- It's  Cynthia.

1302
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,700
- Cynthia Drew. I must see you.
- Just a minute.

1303
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,900
- I'm in a hurry. You go
through the door of my bedroom.
- But where am I going to see you again?

1304
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,600
- What for?
- I can't leave like that.

1305
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,680
Just a minute, Miss Drew.
Will you please, go.

1306
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,100
Not until I've had my breakfast,
I'm too weak.

1307
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,900
All right, help yourself.
And I hope.

1308
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,500
Oh, hello.

1309
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,400
- May I come in?
- Of course, please do.

1310
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,700
I realize I should have
called first, but...

1311
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,400
I haven't had my sleep.

1312
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,500
No, it's quite all right.

1313
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,200
So you are Cynthia?

1314
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,800
- Bobby's told me so much about you.
- Has he?

1315
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:23,801
Yes.

1316
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,400
Come in.

1317
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,601
Come in.

1318
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,200
- Sit down, won't you.
- No, thank you, I'd rather stand.

1319
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,400
I really don't know
where to begin. I'm

1320
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,900
afraid I'm being terribly impulsive.

1321
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,300
And I've always been  impulsive.

1322
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,200
You see, I asked Bob to marry me.
I didn't wait for him to ask me.

1323
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,800
Why should you?

1324
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,200
You mustn't mind me. I've...

1325
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,600
been up all night,
all kinds of things racing through my mind.

1326
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,400
A bride is supposed to be nervous
just before the ceremony.

1327
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,200
At least, so I'm told.

1328
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,300
I'm not a bit nervous,
I'm quite calm.

1329
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,700
I've reason
just hoping I

1330
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,480
Bob mustn't make a mistake -
it would ruin

1331
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,900
his whole life.

1332
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,800
What would?

1333
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,000
Our marriage.

1334
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,300
If he doesn't love me.

1335
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,900
Calm now, sit down.

1336
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,500
You're tired.

1337
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,800
You haven't slept
and you're not yourself.

1338
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,000
It isn't that. You see,
I know about you and Bobby.

1339
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,000
- You know what?
- I know that he loves you.

1340
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,800
- What?
- And I know that you love him,
I just know it.

1341
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,000
Oh you're not serious,
you can't be!

1342
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,900
Why.. it is so ridiculous.

1343
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,100
What can I say to you?
How can I prove to you?

1344
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,560
You didn't even want
to come to the wedding,

1345
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,500
he had to persuade you.
Because deep down you felt
you were losing him forever.

1346
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,800
But I have just  seen so many people.

1347
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,600
- I couldn't face any more.
- It's not too late I...

1348
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:49,120
- I can postpone the wedding.
- You can't. You mustn't.

1349
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,600
I could say he'd been called away
for a very important operation.

1350
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:56,400
I'm calling it off, I must.
The only fair thing...

1351
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,300
- Wait.
- Yes?

1352
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:00,900
Suppose...

1353
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:04,000
- Suppose I told you...
- Yes?

1354
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,520
Suppose I told you
that I was in love
with someone else.

1355
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,800
I wouldn't believe you.

1356
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:14,400
Suppose I told you
that I was married secretly.

1357
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,900
I suppose now you'll
tell me he's overseas.

1358
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,600
Really Miss Malvern,
I don't want to say you're lying,

1359
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:21,300
You are not telling the truth.

1360
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,700
Just a minute,

1361
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,000
- Can you keep a secret?
- Why?

1362
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,000
Come along.

1363
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,300
Chip, darling.

1364
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:35,800
Precious.

1365
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,400
Cynthia, this is my husband.

1366
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:44,100
Precious, this is Cynthia Drew,
she's marrying  Bobby Campbell
this afternoon.

1367
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,200
You're Chip Collyer,
the war correspondent, aren't you?

1368
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,280
- Yes.
- I've heard you lecture the college class.

1369
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,800
and tell  them
the most fantastic stories,

1370
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,500
some of them true.

1371
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,500
Go ahead and
finish your breakfast, dear.

1372
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,700
Sorry, we're out
of the hot cakes.

1373
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,300
Bye, Mr. Collyer.

1374
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:07,900
You can just dry those tears
and make up that face,

1375
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,600
because you're going to be
a very very lovely bride,

1376
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,100
in a very happy way.

1377
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,880
And we'll just forget everything
that's just been said, shall we?

1378
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,800
Of course.
I'm so happy.

1379
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,600
Can you ever forgive me?

1380
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,300
- I'm so glad I came. Good-bye.
- Good-bye

1381
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,900
- See you at he wedding.
- Good-bye and good luck.

1382
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,720
You may go now.

1383
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,700
- What, precious?
- You came in rather handy.

1384
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:44,000
She had some idiotic notion
that I was in love with Bobby.

1385
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,900
She was going to call off the wedding
because of it.

1386
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,100
- I couldn't have that.
- Certainly not.

1387
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,100
When they return from their honeymoon
I'll explain. Do you mind it?

1388
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,300
No, precious.

1389
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,400
- I'm really not angry about last night.
- No?

1390
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,500
In a way, I suppose,
I am to blame.

1391
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,500
- I wouldn't say so.
- Good-bye.

1392
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,600
- Look, what about...?
- Lunch? I'm sorry but I'll be
terribly busy.

1393
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,800
- Then...
- I'm going to the wedding
later this afternoon.

1394
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,900
And my picture has its premiere
tonight.

1395
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,000
- I have a great many thing to do
before that.
- Yes, precious.

1396
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,300
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, precious.

1397
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,600
Good morning, Mr. Collyer.

1398
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:25,200
Good-bye, Mr. Chip Collyer.

1399
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,800
- Come in.

1400
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,900

Take it away, take it away.

1405
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,500
- Do you mind signing the check, Mr. Edley?
- Certainly, certainly.

1406
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,500
Thank you, sir.

1407
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,500
You're welcome.
Now let's see. Where were we?

1408
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,900
Confirming our verbal understanding
with His Highness the Bey,

1409
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,000
Gideon Oil agrees to supply
equipment enumerated below:

1410
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,300
- geologists, engineers...
- You know, Bunny?

1411
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,700
This deal we're working out
is one of the biggest deals
in the country,

1412
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:16,800
- in the world.
- I know.

1413
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,200
I want to transfer my headquarters
to New York.

1414
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,000
- I'm going to get myself
a swell apartment.
- You are?

1415
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,200
Of course I won't be here
all the time, just come and go,
you understand.

1416
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,900
Bunny, I'll need someone

1417
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,000
to take care of my private affairs:

1418
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,700
you know, entertain my friends,

1419
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,200
and business acquaintances.

1420
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,300
Someone easy to look at.

1421
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,900
Smart like you.

1422
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,300
Know what I mean?

1423
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,800
Yes, and no.

1424
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,700
Like a confidential secretary.

1425
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Oh, I see.

1426
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,700
What else would I have to do?

1427
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,200
Nothing.

1428
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,000
Absolutely nothing.

1429
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,100
And you start tonight.

1430
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:57,700
Tonight?

1431
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:01,500
Yes, His Highness the Bey is entertaining me
at the Roof tonight.

1432
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,800
And he's quite a fellow.

1433
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,300
He has diamonds that big.

1434
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:08,500
And he said to me,
it was translated:

1435
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,900
"Bring that pretty little girl along.

1436
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,800
That takes dictation."

1437
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,400
You made quite a hit
with him tonight, yes.

1438
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:19,100
Ah, did I?

1439
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,101
Yes.

1440
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,760
So I want you to dress up nice
and come along.

1441
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,800
Well, I really haven't
anything to wear.

1442
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,500
Oh, I can fix that.

1443
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,900
en The hotel.

1444
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,200
Well, the only thing is I...

1445
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,900
have a date tonight.

1446
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:38,400
Who with?

1447
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,500
Oh let me see,
where was I?

1448
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,700
- Gideon Oil...
- What does this date mean to you?

1449
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,400
Are you sweet on that guy?

1450
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,100
No.

1451
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,520
- I'm not sweet on anybody.
- Well, I don't get you.

1452
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,500
- Shall we go on?
- OK.

1453
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,800
I am a business man.
I made you an offer
and you turned it down.

1454
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,300
I didn't turn it down.

1455
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,900
I just can't make it.
Tonight.

1456
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:14,240
You  start tonight,
or you don't start at all.

1457
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,400
What will you say?

1458
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,720
Gideon Oil

1459
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,100
agrees to supply equipment

1460
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,400
enumerated below.

1461
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,000
I think I need a shave.

1462
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,800
Hello?

1463
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,400
Put me in he barber-shop, please.

1464
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,400
- That's the barber-shop.

1465
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,280
- Yes, Mr. Edley.
- Thank you.

1466
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,400
This way.

1467
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,300
All right, Joe.

1468
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:56,300
Make it quick, Joe.

1469
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,960
Say, where were you last night?

1470
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,200
A shave.

1471
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,700
- Make out?
- And...

1472
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,000
shine.

1473
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,600
- Shine!
- You didn't see him?

1474
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,900
And a massage.

1475
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,000
-Did you get a story?
- And...

1476
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,300
Let's have a manicure.

1477
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,500
Manicure?

1478
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:18,000
Please tell the fellow.
After all, I told the boss
you were taking over.

1479
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,700
I'm going to a wedding,
that's why I'm getting the works.

1480
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:22,500
What wedding?

1481
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,300
The Drew wedding, you know?
That very rich dame.

1482
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:26,700
You got an invitation to that one?

1483
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,500
Sure, here it is.

1484
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,700
Yes, this pretty special.

1485
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,100
Certainly.

1486
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,700
You're going back on the Edley story.
I'm coming to this wedding.

1487
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,100
Wait a minute.
What do I tell the boss?

1488
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,700
And hair.

1489
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,900
You're wanted
on the telephone, Mr Collyer.

1490
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:50,000
Hello, Mr. Collyer?

1491
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,800
This is Cynthia Drew.

1492
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,100
I've been trying
to get you everywhere.

1493
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:57,800
I've done something rather awful,
I told Mother about you and

1494
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,600
I was so happy,
I didn't stop to think

1495
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,300
She told my uncle,
he's here for the wedding,
you know.

1496
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,700
Did you tell anybody else?

1497
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,700
Well, I told Bobby,
Dr. Campbell, you know.

1498
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,400
Anybody else?

1499
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,800
Joe, she is my best friend.

1500
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,700
Anybody else?

1501
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,000
No, not a soul.

1502
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,500
Except, of course
I had to tell  Mildred,

1503
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,500
because Joe would have
told her anyway.

1504
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,700
- The "Jade Room" please.
- Yes, Miss Malvern.

1505
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:57,800
She is Irene Malvern.

1506
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,700
Randy, find  a seat for her
in a prominent place.

1507
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,300
I'm so glad she came!

1508
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,300
- Irene.
- Hello, Randy, how's Suzy?

1509
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,100
I have a good mind
never to speak to you again.

1510
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,000
- Why didn't you tell me
you were married?
- What?

1511
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,600
- And to Chip Collyer.
-Who told you that?

1512
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,100
Never mind,
but I've got to write the story.

1513
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,960
I can't explain now,
so just ignore it.

1514
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,400
I can't ignore it,
somebody's got to print it.

1515
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,520
- Is it true or isn't it?
-You want me yo deny it?

1516
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,200
Yes, certainly, deny it, deny it.

1517
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,600
- Right after the honeymoon.
- Right after the honeymoon.

1518
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,000
What did you say?

1519
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,600
I've saved your seat, dear.

1520
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,500
- You..
- Here comes Mrs  Drew.

1521
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:03,800
- You told Randy Morton.
- What?

1522
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:08,300
- That we were married.
- No. Never laid eyes on the fellow.

1523
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,100
Beautiful.

1524
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,700
We must have
a proper ceremony too.

1525
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,800
What?

1526
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,700
- We are married under the law.
- What law?

1527
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:36,000
- You introduced me as your husband.
- Well?

1528
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,800
- That makes me your common law husband.
- That's silly!

1529
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:48,100
- So you think yourself above the law?
- I never heard of such a thing.

1530
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:52,400
Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
Let your attorney now consult mine.

1531
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:55,600
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Here comes the bride.
Smile, precious.

1532
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,360
Attagirl!

1533
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,000
Let go my hand.

1534
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,300
Ready?

1535
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,500
Well.

1536
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,400
Congratulations.

1537
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,200
I know you two
will be very happy.

1538
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,400
I won't forget it
as long as I live.

1539
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,600
May I?

1540
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,000
It's not every day one gets to kiss
a movie star.

1541
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,600
That's right.

1542
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,700
- I've had about enough.
- Just one more. A loving couple.

1543
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,920
- I haven't come here to be openly pestered by you.
- Here's to bride and groom!

1544
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,040
Both brides, both grooms!

1545
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:37,100
Waldorf Tower entrance.

1546
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,900
Yes, sir. OK.

1547
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,100
Miss Malvern's car
to the  Park Avenue entrance.

1548
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,800
Miss Malvern's car
is at the Avenue entrance

1549
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,100
Tell her please,
she's in the "Circle Room".

1550
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:20,400
I want to thank you
for the thunderous reception
you've given my picture

1551
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:24,200
- You can't say thunderous, boss.
- Irene Malvern can say anything.

1552
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,600
This is going to be the biggest open
this town ever seen.

1553
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,400
How do you feel about "thunderous"?

1554
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,000
-What?
- You weren't listening.

1555
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Are you looking for somebody?

1556
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:36,500
No, no.

1557
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,700
I beg you pardon.

1558
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,000
Miss Malvern's car
is at the  Park Avenue entrance.

1559
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,800
"Grandball Room",
the elevator's to your right, sir.

1560
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,900
- Is there a special elevator
to the "Star Light Room"?
- Yes, sir. Right through there.

1561
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:07,901
Thank you.

1562
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,500
I...

1563
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,200
a little early.

1564
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,720
- I think I'd like
to order dinner in advance.
- Yes, sir.

1565
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,720
Lobster cocktail, to begin with?

1566
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,400
Sounds all right to me.
She'd like that.

1567
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,900
Vichyssoise?

1568
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,800
It's a cold soup,
very thick.

1569
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:38,900
Cream.

1570
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,100
Well, I guess you know your business.

1571
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,800
Now...

1572
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,800
something really elegant
for the main course.

1573
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,000
- Have you got pheasant?
- Yes, sir.

1574
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,000
Good.

1575
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,300
Ah, yes! And she likes...
What did she call it?

1576
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,300
Something like shirts - "crêpes suzettes".

1577
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:55,500
Yes, sir.

1578
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,800
And you might bring
some champagne now,
to get started.

1579
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,500
- Any preferences?
- No, I leave that up to you.

1580
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:03,700
Thank you, sir.

1581
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:07,800
- What a place you've got here!
- Yes, sir.

1582
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:09,200
What a place!

1583
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,840
Her name is Miss Smith,
mine's Hollis.

1584
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,480
In case she asks for me,
I don't want to get lost.

1585
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,100
I will be careful.

1586
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:20,900
- Captain Hollis.
- Yes.

1587
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,100
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

1588
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,200
Thank you, sir.

1589
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:36,500
<i>Forgive me but I can't possibly
meet you tonight.</i>

1590
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:39,000
<i> I'll explain tomorrow.
Bunny</i>

1591
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,300
Any answer, sir?

1592
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,400
No.

1593
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,100
No answer.

1594
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:29,500
Here we are, sir.

1595
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,400
Well chilled.

1596
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,500
- Take the other plate away.
- Sir?

1597
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,000
I'll be alone.

1598
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:38,400
Yes, sir.

1599
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,400
Might take away this with you, too.
Maybe your wife will like it.

1600
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,900
Thank you, sir.

1601
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,900
- Cigars?
- No, Thanks. I have some.

1602
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ken Carpenter speaking.

1603
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,400
from the famous "Star Light Roof"
in the Waldorf Astoria, New-York city

1604
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,100
We bring you Xavier Cugat,
his orchestra, his fire Juanita,

1605
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,100
who is back
with Cugat again.

1606
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,100
The Mexican Rhapsody based on

1607
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,500
Guadalajara.

1608
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,500
Well, Cuggy.

1609
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:20,400
It's a gay evening here
in the "Star Light Roof".

1610
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,600
Here's a large card,

1611
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:23,700
including many celebrities among the guests.

1612
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,800
And right at this moment
His Highness the Bey of Aribajan

1613
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:28,720
and his party are
being shown to a table

1614
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,400
directly opposite the band stand.

1615
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,000
And now on with our program
as Cuggy  tells you about his next number.

1616
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,300
Thank you, Ken.

1617
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,500
Signoras y signores, this is Xavier Cugat speaking.

1618
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,700
Continuing our program we're playing
for the first time in the air

1619
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:44,300
a new song entitled
"And there you are",

1620
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,080
written by lieutenant
Joseph Goodman

1621
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,680
of the Army Air forces.

1622
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,800
It's a beautiful song
and I'm sure you will like the way
Bob Graham sings it.

1623
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:06,560
<i>Though we're oceans apart</i>

1624
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:12,300
<i>You're never out of my heart</i>

1625
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:18,300
<i>I simply close my eyes,</i>

1626
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,700
<i>and there...</i>

1627
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,800
<i>...you are.</i>

1628
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:30,000
<i>There in the dawn...</i>

1629
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,400
<i>...early light</i>

1630
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,600
<i>and...</i>

1631
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:38,800
<i>...in the still of the night,</i>

1632
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:44,800
<i>I look behind the stars...</i>

1633
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,500
<i>and there...</i>

1634
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,300
<i>...you are.</i>

1635
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:54,100
<i>Whenever there's
a storm,</i>

1636
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,400
<i>I don't even hear the thunder</i>

1637
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,800
<i>My heart with love
is so aflame,</i>

1638
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:07,000
<i>I only hear each
little raindrop...</i>

1639
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:10,300
<i>...repeating...</i>

1640
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,700
<i>...your name.</i>

1641
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,640
<i>And when the long...</i>

1642
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,120
<i>...day is through,</i>

1643
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,840
<i>I long for you,</i>

1644
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,600
<i>only your.</i>

1645
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:36,960
<i>And I pretend you're there...</i>

1646
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,100
<i>and there...</i>

1647
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:43,200
<i>...you are...</i>

1648
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:13,000
May I have the pleasure of this dance?

1649
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,200
Will you give me your permission?

1650
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,200
Of course.

1651
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:21,700
Would you excuse me a moment, please?

1652
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,800
Stevens, why don't you
dance with Bunny?

1653
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:28,100
Shall we?

1654
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,100
No, thank you,
I feel a little...

1655
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,100
Did you get my note?

1656
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,600
Oh, yeah.

1657
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:01,300
I'm awfully sorry about tonight, but

1658
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:06,100
Mr. Edley insisted.
I tried to phone you.

1659
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:08,200
No, it's all right. I understand.

1660
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:10,400
Well...

1661
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:13,700
- Could I offer..
Wouldn't you like some wine?
- No.

1662
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:14,800
Thank you.

1663
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,400
Let's dance.

1664
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,000
Yes, sure, sure.

1665
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:26,500
You see, we have
Gideon Petroleum, we have Jessup...

1666
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:29,400
- You have to explain the name\\\.
- Ah, yes.

1667
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:37,300
Now if we take
Gideon Petroleum...

1668
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,400
...20 million  dollars.

1669
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:11,200
How about some fresh air?

1670
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:14,300
That's a noble idea.

1671
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:52,900
Gee, that's a lovely song.

1672
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,800
It was sure nice of Mr Cugat
to play it.

1673
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:58,160
You see, I wired Joe's mother
to listen in.

1674
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:00,100
He used to be a  professional musician.

1675
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,800
Ah, he was quite a guy.

1676
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:08,100
It must have been awful
for you sitting there
listening to it alone.

1677
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,400
Oh, no! No.

1678
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:14,100
You see, I couldn't come tonight,
I meant to.

1679
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,800
I wanted to very much.

1680
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,100
But...

1681
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:19,700
Yeah.

1682
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:23,600
- Would you like to sit down?
- No, thank you,

1683
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,300
...I have to get back in a minute.

1684
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,400
Mr. Edley is mad,
but I'll explain it to him.

1685
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:31,500
You see? He is very rich,

1686
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,300
he is in oil.

1687
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:35,300
And he likes me.

1688
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:37,400
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1689
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,500
He likes me very much.

1690
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:42,700
Is he gonna marry you?

1691
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:44,900
No.

1692
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:48,500
I'm going to be
his  confidential secretary,

1693
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:51,700
entertaining his friends
and business acquaintances.

1694
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,800
And you want that?

1695
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:58,000
Well, you know,
no matter what they tell you,

1696
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,400
You don't get offers
like that every day.

1697
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,760
I don't think it's so hot.

1698
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:05,500
Don't you?

1699
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:07,800
I do.

1700
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,100
Oh, Bunny, I know...

1701
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,000
I wish I had
a needle and a thread.

1702
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:16,000
OK, OK,
I'll shut up.

1703
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:19,300
Oh, no! That button's loose.

1704
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,000
Can you cook, too?

1705
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:27,500
No.

1706
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,300
-  I can.
- Really?

1707
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:34,900
If we were in Jasmond, I'd make
the best barbecue you ever had.

1708
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:38,600
And we'd eat it under stars,
big big chunky stars,

1709
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,100
not like these.

1710
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,300
It gets pretty hot
back there n the sun.

1711
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:47,500
Folks in Jasmond generally
do their cooking outdoors.

1712
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,300
Kitchens get so hot.

1713
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,600
No hotter in the kitchens
than in double 5th.

1714
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:59,100
Only when it gets too hot
we go to delicatessen

1715
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:02,600
and get some hot dogs,
and potato salad and a coke.

1716
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:07,100
And the cops open the hydrants,
and kids splash around,

1717
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,100
and the radios
go on all night,

1718
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:14,200
and the firemen sit outside
the firehouse in their undershirts.

1719
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:18,300
And then just when you think
you can grab some sleep,

1720
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,000
somebody starts a fight.

1721
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:25,600
And then you just
give up trying to sleep,

1722
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,700
and wait for morning.

1723
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:30,600
Some fun.

1724
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:34,000
And Edley is gonna make it
all different.

1725
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,500
Jasmond's different.

1726
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:44,900
- Well, when you get back there..
- If I get back there.

1727
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:46,900
Oh, but you will, Jimmy.

1728
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,200
You will, must,
you've got a good chance on Tuesday.

1729
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:52,480
Doctor Campbell wrote that
in his letter to Washington.

1730
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:55,280
What do you know about it?

1731
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:01,300
He dictated that letter to me.

1732
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,100
You were in the nest room.

1733
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,800
Jimmy, Jimmy,
promise me you'll try.

1734
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:09,900
Bunny, I need you.

1735
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,000
Jimmy, please, don't say that.

1736
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,400
I've got to look after myself.

1737
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,200
And you're making it
awfully difficult for me.

1738
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,100
Oh, excuse me.

1739
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:25,360
Mr. Edley was wondering
what happened to you.

1740
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,300
I'll be back in a second.

1741
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:29,600
OK.

1742
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,800
That's  Mr. Edley's man Friday.

1743
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:38,500
Well I...

1744
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:41,400
Bunny, don't go back,
you don't know what
you're letting yourself in for.

1745
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,800
Good night, Jimmy.

1746
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:49,600
And good luck on...

1747
01:45:50,101 --> 01:45:51,100
Tuesday.

1748
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,000
Oh Bunny!

1749
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:12,000
I'd better go back.

1750
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,700
Well, here we are.

1751
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:44,800
Look, honey, now that we've got a hit,
don't you think we ought to
have a little celebration?

1752
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,800
Come on over to the 21,
the whole gang's there.

1753
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:49,300
- Come on.
-You two go ahead.
I am tired.

1754
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,600
I'm going to take the war paint off
and go to bed.

1755
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:53,000
Well, maybe you're right. Good night, Irene.

1756
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:56,320
- Good night.
- Are you sure you'll sleep OK tonight?.

1757
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,600
- May I have my key please?\

1758
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,100
Your husband took the key
a few minutes ago, Miss Malvern.

1759
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,000
What?

1760
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,800
May I offer my congratulations?

1761
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,200
Oh, yes!

1762
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:15,900
Thank you.

1763
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,500
Hello, dear.
How did the picture go?

1764
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,200
Tell me all about it.

1765
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:46,800
You have a room
in this hotel, haven't you?

1766
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:48,700
One? I've got four.

1767
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:51,000
From the hall
first turn on the right.
Can't miss it.

1768
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:53,300
- Then you're not homeless.
- Oh hardly.

1769
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,700
Just witless.

1770
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,600
That's a matter of opinion.

1771
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:00,100
I'd really like to know
what goes on
in that mighty brain of yours.

1772
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,880
Ah, sweet mystery of life.

1773
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:05,600
What would lead a man
to take a lady's key

1774
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,880
and tell the clerk that
he's her husband.

1775
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,880
and then plump himself down
in her living-room.

1776
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,400
I'm just curious.
I'll probably never know but

1777
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:13,400
if you're not out of here in two minutes

1778
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,300
I'm going to call the authorities.

1779
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:16,800
That's just variety.

1780
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,080
"Dryden, Sims and  Corner".
I'm indebted to them for these.

1781
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:22,200
Well, according to Blackstone,

1782
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,400
and after all, he is the cornerstone
of our civilization,

1783
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:28,400
there's no doubt that we are
really legally married

1784
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:32,000
For right here... it says... in...

1785
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:34,100
"Ravendew versus Clancy,

1786
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:37,800
which engaged the attention
of  the Supreme Court
in September of 1896..."

1787
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,900
I don't want to hear about it.

1788
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:42,100
No, but this is one...
Excuse me.

1789
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:44,000
One that I did want you to hear.

1790
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:49,000
June 1904.
Rancon versus Hoover.

1791
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:51,280
Plain had admitted
he had presented Miss Hoover

1792
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,800
to various acquaintances
as his wife.

1793
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:56,500
The result:
Rancon died

1794
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:00,100
Miss Hoover collected a fortune
as his legal wife.

1795
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,880
Will you please, get
yourself and those books

1796
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,240
out of here?

1797
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,000
I insist on my rights.

1798
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,520
Your rights?

1799
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:09,100
As...

1800
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:11,600
your common law husband.

1801
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:16,200
Will you please go back to your apartments?

1802
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:18,000
Definitely, no.

1803
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,240
Will you see what it is, dear.

1804
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,600
I'm not in to anyone.

1805
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,250
That's right.
We don't want  to be disturbed,
do we, precious?

1806
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:31,440
Come over here
and sit down by me.

1807
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:35,200
- For the last time, will you go?
- Sorry, no.

1808
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:02,800
You still didn't have
to do that, you know.

1809
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:06,200
- And there's one thing
I must tell you.
- What?

1810
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:09,500
Mrs  Collyer,I will never
give you a divorce.

1811
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:28,100
<i>Early Sunday morning
in Park Avenue</i>

1812
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,500
<i>is just about
like Sunday morning everywhere.</i>

1813
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:34,200
<i>A New York policeman
can have just as little to do
as a village constable,</i>

1814
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:36,900
<i>only a little more space
to do it in.</i>

1815
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,900
<i>And a Waldorf cat can be just as philanderous
as a cat in a motel,</i>

1816
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,400
<i>and just as hungry.</i>

1817
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,500
<i>though he should have gone
to the  service entrance.</i>

1818
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,080
<i>The service entrance, incidentally, is
where you'll find my column</i>

1819
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,520
<i>being delivered in large bundles</i>

1820
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,960
<i>entirely surrounded by funny papers.</i>

1821
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:56,100
<i>Now comes the Waldorf
poodle parade,</i>

1822
01:50:56,100 --> 01:51:00,200
<i>in which this morning
poor little Suzy unfortunately
couldn't participate.</i>

1823
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:25,000
IRENE MALVERN MARRIED?

1824
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:29,100
Mr. Collyer!

1825
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,100
Mr. Collyer!

1826
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,900
- Mr. Collyer!
- Yes, take it easy.

1827
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,600
What do you think I've got?

1828
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:42,200
- Mumps.
- No, look at this.

1829
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,500
I see what appears to be
a table cloth.

1830
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,400
- What do you think of that?
- Waldorf?

1831
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,400
-From the Roof.
- With the spoons?

1832
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,500
No, you don't get it.
Look at this.

1833
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,300
Somebody doodled there.

1834
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,160
The Bey gave a party last night.

1835
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:59,100
So I thought:
"What would Mr. Collyer do?"

1836
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:02,400
I sneaked up there
and there was Edley
writing on this table cloth.

1837
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,500
And when they left
I thought:

1838
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:07,900
"What would Mr. Collyer do
with that table cloth?"
So, I stole it.

1839
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,800
Gideon. Jessup.

1840
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:12,500
20 million,  worldwide petroleum.

1841
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:15,280
That sounds like the setup.

1842
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,100
Call up Jessup.
See if he is in it.

1843
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:20,100
If he is you've got a big story,
if he isn't you've got a bigger story.

1844
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:21,680
Don't stand there,
get some clothes on

1845
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,520
and get down to the office
to write that yarn.

1846
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:26,000
Just a minute,
you haven't got your clothes on.

1847
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,900
- You want me to write the story?
- Of course, it's all yours.

1848
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:33,600
I've just read in the paper
that you got married.
Congratulations.

1849
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,300
- Thanks very much.
-  You are my idol.

1850
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:36,200
No.

1851
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:45,100
Eh! Your shirt is showing up.

1852
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:48,900
I can't wait, I've got a big story to write.
I mean...

1853
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:51,600
Where are the stairs?
I'll walk.

1854
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,800
You are on the 39th floor.

1855
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:56,100
I though I'd save time..

1856
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:17,800
Jimmy.

1857
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,600
Oh.

1858
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,100
Did you want to see me?

1859
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,520
I didn't know you are in.

1860
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,520
I didn't think you worked on Sundays.

1861
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:29,200
I was just finishing up. Come in.

1862
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,400
Was it a good party? Did you have fun?

1863
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,400
Sure.
I did a  rumba with the Bey,

1864
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:41,300
a two-step with Mr. Edley
and a waltz with somebody else.

1865
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:45,800
Cinderella was right back
on  10th avenue at midnight.

1866
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,500
With a headache.

1867
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:49,900
Did you want me to do something?

1868
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:52,000
No, it's...
Just this is for you.

1869
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,100
Just put it away.

1870
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,600
"Not to be opened until Tuesday".

1871
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,400
Why Tuesday?

1872
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:02,600
It just won't mean anything
to you until Tuesday.

1873
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:06,000
- That's my phone.
- If it's Mr. Edley...

1874
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:08,400
Probably, as I 'm supposed
to have lunch with him.

1875
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:11,200
No. No, don't answer it, please.

1876
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:12,900
Until Tuesday.

1877
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:15,440
But I'm a public stenographer here.

1878
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,440
And it's part of my job to answer my phone.

1879
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,700
I know, I know, but...

1880
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,300
I'd rather you wouldn't.

1881
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,700
I don't have to tell you this,
but...

1882
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,100
I've been thinking about you.

1883
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:34,600
Well, it's all there.
Very legal.

1884
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:37,600
It's my army insurance.

1885
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:43,300
But Jimmy!

1886
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:48,400
Well, I haven't got anybody
to leave it to anyway.

1887
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,400
If I don't come through on Tuesday,

1888
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:54,100
you can have
Park Avenue without Edley.

1889
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:57,500
You are...

1890
01:54:57,740 --> 01:54:58,900
You're beautiful,

1891
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,700
and you're smart.

1892
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:03,120
Why,  you can have your own agency

1893
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:05,120
be your own boss, you know?

1894
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:09,500
You can even go to college,
if you like, in style.

1895
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,920
Without Edley and his kind

1896
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:17,900
I don't have to say that,
but...

1897
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:20,000
All I'm asking you to do is...

1898
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,200
wait

1899
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:23,120
until Tuesday.

1900
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:26,200
Good-bye.

1901
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,000
Jimmy!

1902
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:56,000
Well, Mr. Collyer,
this seems to be all right,

1903
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:58,100
but even though it's signed,

1904
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:01,800
I wonder if you couldn't
change it just a little
as I suggested before?

1905
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:03,400
- How?
- Like this.

1906
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:06,100
Miss Malvern
and I are not married,

1907
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,700
we're just pals.

1908
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:10,720
No, she rides as she stands.

1909
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:13,300
Miss Malvern and I are not married,
we're not even pals.

1910
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:16,400
She obviously loathes me,
and that, gentlemen,

1911
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:18,720
in my opinion, is not a solid basis

1912
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,720
for a happy enduring marriage, so...

1913
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,900
Miss Malvern and I
are not married,

1914
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:24,800
we're not even pals.

1915
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:26,100
All right, all right.

1916
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:28,080
Gentlemen, I guess that's all.

1917
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:31,120
- Well, bon voyage.
- Thank you.

1918
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:34,720
There it is. Legal.

1919
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,800
"We're not even pals."

1920
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:41,300
- Was this his idea?
- He insisted on it.

1921
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,900
I argued with him for hours.

1922
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:46,300
- I guess he laughed.
- No.

1923
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:49,600
- Oh, was he angry?
- No.

1924
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:53,900
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

1925
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:56,600
He just said "This is my statement.
We took it down,
we consulted each other,

1926
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:59,000
recovered the important points,
and so we accepted it.

1927
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:01,100
You know, he is a nice fellow.

1928
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:03,520
What's nice about him?

1929
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,280
What do you want?
A complete psychoanalysis?

1930
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,280
He just struck me as being a nice fellow.

1931
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:09,840
Thank you very much.

1932
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:12,300
Sorry to have caused you
so much trouble.

1933
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:15,400
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- Sure, I know you're tired.

1934
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:17,300
But you're leaving tomorrow.

1935
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,900
Of course it's a good thing
we've got this in writing.

1936
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,700
But he wouldn't have
given you any trouble.

1937
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:25,520
Anyway he's going overseas
tomorrow morning.

1938
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:28,900
- He is?
- Yes. He called from the airport
while we were there.

1939
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:30,880
Your know...

1940
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,900
You ought to send him
a going-away present,

1941
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:35,120
like vitamin pills.
You know what conditions are.

1942
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:37,120
They need vitamin pills.

1943
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,400
Who knows?

1944
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:40,240
He may never come back.

1945
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:43,900
Why do you say that?

1946
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:47,520
You shouldn't say a thing like that!

1947
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:49,400
After all, he's
a war correspondent.

1948
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,080
Irene.

1949
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:55,500
- You're not stuck on this fellow?
- Certainly not.

1950
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:58,100
- You're sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

1951
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:00,200
That's great.
You had me worried there
for a minute.

1952
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:02,480
- There's nothing for you
to worry about.
I assure you.

1953
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,260
That's my Irene!

1954
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:06,100
I wouldn't want you to be
like the others,

1955
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:09,000
with husbands, with children,
with families, with complications.

1956
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:10,500
You're alone.

1957
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:13,400
You've got nobody to worry you,
nobody to worry about.

1958
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:15,840
You go up to the studio in the morning,
you play your scene.

1959
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,080
And you come back at night.

1960
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:19,400
The house is quiet,
it's peaceful.

1961
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:22,000
You have a nice dinner
and you go right to bed.

1962
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,540
You're alone.

1963
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:24,600
Perfect, isn't it?

1964
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:26,600
Perfect? It's ideal.

1965
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:28,560
You get up the next morning,
you go to the studio.

1966
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:29,440
You come back.

1967
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:33,100
You haven't got a husband to fight with,
no kids with measles,
no relatives.

1968
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:35,040
- You're alone.
- That's wonderful.

1969
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,040
If you feel like playing the radio,
you play it.

1970
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,940
You haven't got to worry about him.

1971
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:43,040
If you like reading, you read.
If you like sleeping, you sleep.
-Yes.

1972
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,200
If you ever want kids,
you adopt a couple of them.

1973
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:47,100
And you hire a nurse.
You don't even have to see them.

1974
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:51,000
I tell you, if I knew then
what I know now,
my life would be different too.

1975
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:53,600
And I'm not saying anything
against Mrs. Burton.

1976
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:55,000
Good-bye, Henry

1977
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:57,400
Believe me, Irene, there's nothing else

1978
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,120
in life but work.

1979
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:00,900
Oh yes, there is.

1980
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:04,700
- What, for instance?
- Well, there's ... fishing.

1981
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:07,000
Yes, sure.

1982
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:10,800
Say, I didn't know
you like fishing.

1983
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:15,280
I'm ringing Captain Hollis,
Miss Smith.

1984
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:17,300
He's still out?

1985
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:20,500
Please try again.

1986
01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:26,100
Are you sure
you're ringing the right room?

1987
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:28,200
I'm calling
Captain James Hollis.

1988
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:30,500
<i>I'm still ringing
Captain Hollis's room.</i>

1989
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:46,100
Yes.

1990
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:49,000
Excuse me, I believe
I left a pipe in the...

1991
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:50,800
and some books.

1992
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:53,520
- Yes, I was just going
to leave them for you.

1993
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,520
They are right here.

1994
01:59:58,620 --> 02:00:00,100
Is there anything else, Madam?

1995
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:02,700
- No, thank you, Anna. Good night.
- Good night.

1996
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,700
This...

1997
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:10,400
This is my lucky pipe,
I didn't want to leave it behind.

1998
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:12,080
I understand
you're going away?

1999
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:15,280
I tried.
I've started packing right now.

2000
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,280
I wonder what I have to do with these.

2001
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:21,280
They've 10 bucks pawn
in a little pawn shop\\

2002
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:23,600
I thought you got them
from your lawyers.

2003
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:28,000
You don't think any lawyer
in his right mind would
have me as a client?

2004
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:31,400
Any more than any woman
in her right mind would

2005
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:32,900
have me as a husband.

2006
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,720
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

2007
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:36,700
I'm sure many women would.

2008
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,900
Name them.

2009
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:41,800
- I can't say offhand.
-Think woman.

2010
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:43,900
I'm in the market
for a wife. I told you that.

2011
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:46,640
You won't have me,
you ought to know
a good second choice.

2012
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:48,000
Someone

2013
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:52,300
not as attractive as you are,
but, fairly attractive;

2014
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:56,240
not as warm hearted, but,
fairly warm hearted;

2015
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:59,100
Not as exciting, but

2016
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:02,320
fairly exciting.
Think.

2017
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:06,900
Well, I don't know many women,
except actresses.

2018
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:10,880
Nice thing about picture actresses, though,

2019
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,880
you can look them over on the screen
before you meet 'em.

2020
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,900
Who did you have in mind?

2021
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:20,200
Well, I have one or two stand-ins...

2022
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:21,201
No.

2023
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:24,300
No substitutes won't do.

2024
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:26,800
It's you or nobody.

2025
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:28,900
I can't have you,
so...

2026
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:32,200
well, it was just a crazy notion anyhow.

2027
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,700
Sort of a weekend mirage.

2028
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:38,000
Imagine two people like us

2029
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:39,400
getting together.

2030
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,300
Ridiculous, isn't it?

2031
02:01:41,580 --> 02:01:42,700
Ridiculous.

2032
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:46,500
Oil and water don't mix.

2033
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:49,400
Oil and water don't mix.

2034
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:51,800
Law of physics.

2035
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,700
Law of physics.

2036
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:56,100
Common sense.

2037
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:58,300
Common sense.

2038
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:00,100
East is East.

2039
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:02,500
West is West.

2040
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:05,200
Simple arithmetic.

2041
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:06,900
It doesn't add up.

2042
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:08,800
Doesn't...

2043
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:10,640
..add up.

2044
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:16,300
Good morning Waldorf.

2045
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:19,500
No, sir, it's not Tuesday,
it's Monday. I'm sorry.

2046
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,000
- Park Avenue entrance?
- Just a moment, please.

2047
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:24,900
- Good morning, Mr. Morton.
- Good morning.

2048
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:28,400
Good morning to these, too.

2049
02:02:28,860 --> 02:02:29,700
Look.

2050
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:31,500
Triplet.

2051
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,560
-Congratulations, Mr. Morton.

2052
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:39,100
And a very happy day for all.

2053
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,840
I think on occasions like this
it is customary

2054
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:43,280
- to dispense regards.
- Thank you, sir.

2055
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:44,720
For you, Harry? -Oh, thank you.

2056
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,400
To you, boy. - Thank you.

2057
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:47,700
Be very careful.

2058
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:49,600
Don't ...

2059
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,100
A nice weekend, Mr. Jessup?

2060
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:59,100
- Morning paper, sir?
- No, thank you,
I've seen the morning paper.

2061
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:02,000
Martin X. Edley involved.

2062
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:05,040
Government officials
defraud suspected.

2063
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:08,900
Let me see that again.

2064
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:11,600
It's that fellow, Collyer.

2065
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:13,500
I knew we would have
trouble with him.

2066
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:15,200
I'll fix him.

2067
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:33,000
but you're not leaving.
You can't.

2068
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:37,300
You don't believe this, do you?.
There isn't a word of truth in it!

2069
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:40,600
I tell you, Jessup
is behind me 100%.

2070
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:43,120
Sorry but His Highness
is leaving very shortly.

2071
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:44,800
But it's a pack of lies, lies.

2072
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:47,700
- Where's His Highness? Where's the Bey?
- In the solarium.

2073
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:51,900
Oh, Your Highness, I...

2074
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:55,100
- Hello, Edley.
- Jessup!

2075
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:56,900
That's the name.

2076
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:00,560
But Mr. Jessup,  I can explain all this.

2077
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,500
Explanations are not in order.

2078
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:04,500
I'm afraid you little scheme
just didn't work.

2079
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:06,700
His Highness is not signing with you.

2080
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,300
You'll be sorry.

2081
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:10,080
Go on, say that to him.

2082
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:13,240
- I could have made him rich.
- To tell you the truth, Mr. Edley,

2083
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:15,300
I am far too rich already.

2084
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:16,900
It worried me at times.

2085
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:18,500
He speaks English!

2086
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:21,700
Yes, hey tell me,
I speak it quite well for a foreigner.

2087
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:25,600
You see, Mr. Edley,
mine is a very sad life,
very dull.

2088
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:28,800
You have brightened it considerably,
I am very grateful.

2089
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:31,120
Thank you, Mr. Jessup.

2090
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:32,900
- I'll see you in Washington.
- Your Highness.

2091
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:37,200
He speaks English.

2092
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:39,400
So does the  FBI.

2093
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:50,500
- Here you are, sir.
Hope you enjoyed your weekend.
- Thank you.

2094
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:53,000
Oh boy!.

2095
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:56,100
- Could you get my bag, please? 2318.
- Yes, sir.

2096
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:57,300
I'll be in the lobby.

2097
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:19,300
- Good-bye, Chip, and good luck.
- Bye boss.
Thanks for everything.

2098
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:22,200
I told you  all you needed
was a good old-fashioned rest.

2099
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:27,500
Excuse me.

2100
02:05:30,740 --> 02:05:32,560
Pardon me. Did Captain Hollis come back?.

2101
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,020
I called. His phone doesn't answer.

2102
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:36,200
I think Captain Hollis
just this moment left.

2103
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:09,200
- Jimmy, I want to talk to you.
- Yes.

2104
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:10,000
I...

2105
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,100
Come over here.

2106
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:18,200
Jimmy, I can't make you do this.
I just can't.

2107
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:21,280
But I told you,
there was really nobody.

2108
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:22,200
I know.

2109
02:06:22,540 --> 02:06:24,500
That's why I'm going
to Washington with you.

2110
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:26,700
- If you let me.
- To Washington?

2111
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:29,900
Jimmy, you've got to pull through.

2112
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,400
Then when you are all
well and ready,

2113
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:34,400
we'll go to Jasmond together.

2114
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:36,800
- If you want me.
- To Jasmond?

2115
02:06:37,580 --> 02:06:39,300
I'm not afraid of bees.

2116
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:45,300
Pardon me, sir,
but the cab is waiting.

2117
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:46,500
Come on, Bunny.

2118
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:49,500
Hello, boss, it's Skilly.

2119
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:51,300
The car's at the Park Avenue entrance.

2120
02:06:51,740 --> 02:06:52,400
Fine.

2121
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:55,300
Skilly's got the car
on the Park Avenue side,
if you don't mind the mob.

2122
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:58,500
Mind them? I love them.
I love everybody.
I love the world.

2123
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,640
- That's OK.
- Madam, I don't seem to find
your cigarette lighter.

2124
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:03,800
- Never mind that, Anna.
- I see.

2125
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,200
Yeah?

2126
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:06,201
Yeah?

2127
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:09,500
Chip Collyer.
You don't want to talk to him.

2128
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:11,300
Give it to me, of course I do.

2129
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,700
Chip, darling.

2130
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:14,700
Oh I thought you'd gone.

2131
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,200
Oh, you are already at the airport?

2132
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:21,600
You're about to take off?

2133
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:25,200
All right.

2134
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:28,800
Henry, wait for me,
I'll be back
in just a few minutes.

2135
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:31,200
Henry, you've got to remind me
something very important.

2136
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:33,300
When I get back
I want to enlarge my house
on  Beverly Hills.

2137
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,200
He's got to have a study, no view.

2138
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,800
He 's very easily diverted.

2139
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,400
Oh Henry, couldn't I make
my next picture in London?

2140
02:07:39,540 --> 02:07:42,300
- I've got a date in London.
- Where are you going?

2141
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:44,300
To the roof.

2142
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:52,560
Chip!

2143
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:17,600
So as you can see, the Baron
got his necklace after all.

2144
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:21,280
That only goes to prove,
as I often say in my column:

2145
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:25,200
<i>anything can happen
on a week-end at the Waldorf.</i>

2145
02:08:26,305 --> 02:09:26,604
