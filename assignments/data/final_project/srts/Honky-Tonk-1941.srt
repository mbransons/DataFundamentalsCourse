1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,900
Come on, you keep movin'!

3
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,180
Throw eggs, they sure need more tar in a way.

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Get away!

5
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,450
We get enough
to tar an army of mules!

6
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,450
Smitty, How d'you like a beautiful saddle
I'm making for them?

7
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,750
Boys!
We got plenty of feathers.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,050
I stole the old
lady's best pillow.

9
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,900
This is hot enough to fry them alive.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,300
Come on, get them a shot!

11
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,550
You, take off them pants.

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,100
I tell you once again, my friend,
if you think my partner and I cheated you

13
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,800
are making the mistake of your life.

14
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,310
And yet I can stand here with my own gun
pointed at me,  and say

15
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,850
'To err is human,
to forgive divine.'

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,100
We hold no grudge.
We'll shake hands and then forget it.

17
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,350
You skinned us, now
we're gonna skin you.

18
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,900
In a different place.

19
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,350
I can see it's no use trying to fool
a bunch of smart folks like you.

20
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,750
You're right.
We cheated you something cruel
and we got this coming.

21
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,150
We're dead certain....
-Pardon.

22
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,250
Alright. What are we waiting for?

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,050
- Now peel off those pants.
- Now wait a minute.

24
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,100
Before we get those feather under clothes

25
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,250
there's something I'd like to do.

26
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,550
Something I must do
to square my conscience.

27
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,700
I want to make sure that my crooked tricks
are never pulled on you good people again.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm going to show you how they work.

29
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,990
I'm sure you'll never use them
them for personal gain.

30
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,500
No siree, but...

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,800
Now you, sir. You look like a man
who'd like to shine at party,

32
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,850
do a few tricks, isn't that so?

33
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,180
It might be fun
if I know how they are done.

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,350
You're right, dead right, mister.

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,100
- And here's a man
who looks like he can

36
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,100
catch all the tricks the first crack,  out of the bottle.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
Then we can trust them, boys?

38
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,600
If he keep that hammer back.

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,370
You will never regret it, gentlemen.
The  best investment you ever made.

40
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,800
Now if you could half pay,
I am about to disclose to you gentlemen,

41
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,800
all the hidden secrets,
secrets handed down in my family

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,300
from generation to generation.

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,200
Hurry up, or you'll be the last here in line.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,850
One thing you must know
before all else.

45
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,800
All confidence games are aimed to people
who want something for nothing.

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,950
Find out who they are

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,700
and your fortune is made. If...

48
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,800
- and here's the second rule of the game, gentlemen:

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,500
If your hand
is quicker than the eye...

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,700
now draw a bit closer, gents,

51
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,400
keep your attention on my two hands,

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,900
my two lily-white hands

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,300
Nothing up my sleeve,
and no sleeve to have anything up.

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,300
I have here 52
innocent-looking pieces of pasteboard.

55
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,550
I select three of them:
the king of spades,

56
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,350
the king of clubs and the ace of hearts.

57
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,350
But I forgot the spice of my little  game.

58
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,600
A hundred dollar bill.

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,450
my ill-gotten gain
which you so rightfully took from me.

60
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,900
- And which we will keep.
- Very well, we'll use another one.

61
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,100
the one which even now,
reposes behind my shell-like ear.

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,450
- But haven't you cleaned him?
- Well, I sure didn't wash behind his ears.

63
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,700
Do not blame my friend here-
being an honest man

64
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,950
he did not look for tricks.
Your attention, gents.

65
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,600
The game is simple,
the reward is great.

66
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,700
I place these 3 cards face downward on the board.

67
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,420
And the man who is sharp enough,
to guess which card is the ace of hearts

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,000
receives as his reward
this beautifully engraved momento.

69
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,700
Ah, filthy looker,
what crimes are committed in thy name!

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,300
And now gentlemen, for rule three:

71
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,850
a little hocus-pokus, note, that hypnotizes the suckers.

72
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,350
by which, of course,
I couldn't mean any of you, gentlemen.

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,300
Now watch closely, watch closely.

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,950
Take the ace of hearts and win
the riches of the Indies.

75
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,400
Now I'm sure there must be
a red-blooded sportsman among you

76
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,100
who wouldn't mind stepping forward
and a 10-dollar bill in his hand

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,000
he will get the privilege of picking
the magic ace of hearts

78
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,400
and receiving as his reward the hundred dollar bill.

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,900
Now step up here and see
whether the hand is quicker than the eye.

80
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,950
It's a cinch. That's the card there.

81
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,850
Ten dollars,  a mere beggar pal to prove it.

82
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,300
- If I'm right, do I get the seventy dollars?

83
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,150
Not only do you receive the cash award,
you receive the secret of the trick.

84
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,100
Golden knowledge.
Which of you were a lesser man
could rebuke a golden arm.

85
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,900
There.
Don't be your bad, my friends.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,300
The dishonest hand is quicker
than the honest eye.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,950
- This is this one, I've been watching close.
- Pay and play.

88
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,300
And now, my friends, the dithering dream
of all true gamblers.

89
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,350
A 10-to-1 payoff
on a sure thing.

90
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,100
Boy, this is my bet.

91
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Stand back, Peter, I was just reaching for my pocket.

92
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,750
Here.

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,620
- That convinces me.
- Then we can go? - Yes!

94
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes, out of town on a rail.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,450
Oh no, just a minute, my good friends.

96
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,300
I'm going to show you how it works.

97
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,600
Where the elusive ace of hearts reposes

98
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,250
and you will repent it because you have it.

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,650
And who has the ace of hearts
receives the  hundred dollar bill.

100
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,050
I've got it?
Where is it?

101
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
Now watch closely, gentlemen.
Watch closely.

102
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,650
If you would just give me
a little bit of room here, please.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
You'll be amazed
when I show you where it is.

104
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,550
You will be astounded.

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,050
You will regard it
as the miracle of the century.

106
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
Drop the guns.

107
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,430
Get out of here
while you're still wearing shoes.

108
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,550
Keep your hats on
when you say goodbye.

109
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,750
All right, hey, Rube.

110
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,050
Let's get out.

111
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,250
Look at him! Nothing like a peacock!

112
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,050
They almost made us
miss our train, Candy.

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,450
Who are you saying goodbye to?

114
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,150
My laundry.

115
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,400
I got shirts in every town
between here to Abeline.

116
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,450
I wanted to stay in this place
long enough to get my pants pressed.

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,050
Yeah, and we're going to, Sniper.

118
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,850
I'm tired of being run out
of somebody else's  town.

119
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,250
I'm gonna find me a town of my own.

120
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,100
I'm gonna be the gent who says
go or stay.

121
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,650
But I can't do it
with this thing growing out of my hands.

122
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,000
- Are you going to turn honest?
- I'm gonna turn smart.

123
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,660
It's getting us out of business.

124
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,500
Sniper, don't you ever want
to do anything better than

125
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,000
to play "Come on!' to the suckers?

126
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,650
There ain't anything better than

127
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,150
picking up that ace of hearts
and hear them suckers squeal.

128
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,900
Looks like they strike
the gold vein in Yellow Creek.

129
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,750
It will take years to
pay off the debts.

130
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,400
Look where you're going,
otherwise I'll tear your teeth.

131
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,000
Sorry.

132
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,550
Yellow Creek.

133
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,850
I'll get those ten.

134
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,650
- Your spin.
- Give me that ten-note.

135
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,300
- What are you playing, boys, poker?
- Why don't you sit down and find out?

136
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,300
Thanks, folks.
I don't mind if I do.

137
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,080
- Three Jacks.
- It's me.

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,850
Smells kind of good
for such an old trick.

139
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,900
I'm afraid you think
I dropped it on purpose.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,400
No, no,  of course not.
That's the last thing you'd do.

141
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,150
The last thing I'd do
would be speak to a strange man.

142
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,500
- No. You're overdoing it.
- Overdoing what?

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,750
The wide-eyed business.

144
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,700
I think a girl should keep her eyes open.
Wide open.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,650
Now let's see.
As I remember, it usually goes like this:

146
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,250
You were born and raised in
a little town in Vermont.

147
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,550
- Ohio, Nebraska or maybe New Jersey.
- Massachussetts.

148
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,550
- Boston, Mass.
- And your father is a doctor...

149
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,370
preacher or school teacher.
Well, anyway, he's poor, but honest.

150
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,450
My father happened to be a judge.
And he's very honest.

151
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,500
An honest judge.
Was there ever one who wasn't?

152
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,900
Now let's see. The family
meets reverses.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,600
The mortgage is foreclosed,
the mother dies of shame.

154
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,500
So the the poor little  daughter is
thrown out into the cold cold world.

155
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,300
And where does it go?
For the land of opportunities.

156
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,700
The Golden West.

157
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,650
But in the meantime she needs $ 10
to pay for her ticket.

158
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,210
You are lucky, honey.
I've got $ 10.

159
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,840
- Thank you.
- Take it, sister.

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,450
It just happens that I could use $ 10.
Right now.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,900
Honey, you astound me.

162
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,300
Thank you, and you, sir?

163
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,070
- Sure. Why not?
- Thank you.

164
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,800
There just one thing you've left out
of your pretty little story.

165
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,200
They always warn young ladies
about men who have clean hands

166
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,150
in a country where
the honest man works.

167
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,800
Idon'tknow who's
cheating this game

168
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,850
but if he does it again,
I'll shoot his beard off.

169
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,900
Perhaps.

170
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,750
Hello, gentlemen.

171
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,400
Father?

172
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,400
I hardly knew you.

173
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,050
It's been so long.

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,800
- Am I what you expected?
- I don't know what I expected.

175
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,970
But you're just what I'd hoped for.

176
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,430
Howdy?

177
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry, sir...

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,650
Hi! You remember me?
I'm Candy Johnson.

179
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,150
I'm afraid you have
the advantage of me, mister.

180
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,850
You bet.
I've got a wonderful memory.

181
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,000
Never forget a face,
never forget a place.

182
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,100
- How do we dodge town?
- Now see here, young man...

183
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,300
Do not be angry, dear.
It's just another crumby attempt

184
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,050
of Mr. Johnson
to get acquainted.

185
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,350
This is my father, Judge Cotton.

186
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,900
- Did you say Judge Cotton?
- That's right.

187
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,400
And as I said:
an honest judge.

188
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,900
And as I said:
was there ever one who wasn't?

189
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,750
It's easy to make mistakes.
We all do.

190
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,900
People who make mistakes
keep me in business.

191
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,740
You see, I'm justice of the peace here.

192
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,100
Oh, I see. I'm sorry
I mistook you for an old friend.

193
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,200
Come, my dear.
Supper is almost ready.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,900
I must get back to town.
I have an appointment with some folks.

195
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,260
Where could a couple of strangers
get a good steak, Judge?

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,330
The Plaza Saloon has
the best beef in town.

197
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,800
Thank you, Judge.
And good evening.

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
Good evening, Miss. Cotton.

199
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,400
This fellow Candy Johnson
bother you, my dear?

200
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,250
Not half as much as I
bothered him.

201
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,300
Man, man, be careful where you spit,
you might hit a sucker.

202
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,630
They are thicker than flies
in the butcher's shop.
Let's get started.

203
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,150
Dig in.

204
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,100
I told you we're going to use
a different kind of system.

205
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,300
Yes, sir.

206
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,950
The more I look around, the more I think
that maybe this is that town.

207
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,050
What town?

208
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,050
The town that  I ain't
gonna get run out of.

209
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,250
The judge is right. This place
sure got the best beef.

210
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,900
I'm gonna get me a honey.

211
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,900
If it ain't the Candy man.

212
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:09,900
Hi, Gold Dust .

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,380
- How did you know it's me?
- I recognized the brand.

214
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,900
Brad, take over, will you?

215
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,600
Where the devil have you been?
The strike's been on for three weeks.

216
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,550
I wanted to give the suckers time
to get the gold off the ground.

217
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,600
And from what I hear,  they can
pick it out with a knife and a fork.

218
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,800
It's right grown out of the grass root.

219
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,250
Are you interested in
signing a claim for yourself, Candy?

220
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,750
Sure, if it has nothing
to do with digging.

221
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,410
- Hello, Brazos.
- Your table is cooling off.

222
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,750
How did you know
that gent was behind you?

223
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,000
I have a lot of practice smelling up snakes.

224
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,800
Don't tell me this town has got
a sheriff that crawls on his belly?

225
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,850
He makes the rest of us do the crawling.
He owns this joint.

226
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,800
It looks like we can get
a gold mine without the calluses.

227
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,250
We get the calluses.
Make yourself at home, Candy man.

228
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,170
Like I've never been  away, honey.

229
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,050
A Burbon, please.

230
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,150
- Good evening, Judge.
-Hello, my boy, how are you?

231
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,950
I trust that that little farce I indulged in
down the depot did not disturb you?

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,650
No, no. Sarsparilla.

233
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,550
- Still on the water wagon, eh? - Yep.

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,150
And how's your drinking these days, Judge?

235
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,950
I'm kind of a little nervous tonight.

236
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,750
I hardly ever touch it anymore.

237
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,550
You never did,
except with your mouth.

238
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,000
My boy, I'm gonna put you
next to a good thing.

239
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,200
That's the place I like to be.

240
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,600
I got myself up a nice little rig here.

241
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,650
A pillar of society. Respectable.
I am Justice of the peace.

242
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,650
Collecting fines right and left.

243
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,950
How would you like
to get a cut in on it?

244
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,050
Tell that gift horse of yours to open his mouth,
I want to take a squint at his teeth.

245
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,850
Of course I had expected you'd
advance me a thousand, so just a ...

246
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,260
to show me your good faith. - No.

247
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,250
Those teeth need
too much filling.

248
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,850
A man is a fool to try to con you, Candy.

249
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Yeah. Especially a man who's got
all the earmarks of being out on a limb.

250
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,900
I am out on a limb and
a shaky one.

251
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,750
They are showing it off right now.

252
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,600
They are beginning to wonder where
those fines went to.

253
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,750
Sounds like it's time for you
to run out of town.

254
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,200
Past time.
But I can't leave just now.

255
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,400
You see, my daughter insisted on
joining me here.

256
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,550
I can't go, I can't stay.
I am caught.

257
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,800
How much would I have to dig up,

258
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,000
to keep that respectable photo of yours
from getting full of bullet holes?

259
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,400
- 400 or 500. Have you got it Candy?

260
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Not on me. But I will.

261
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,050
I demand to see those cards.
I suspect there's no ace of spades in the deck.

262
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,900
Wait a minute.
Something's always squawking.

263
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,600
Three aces ain't enough,
five are too many.

264
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,050
I ran my goose.
Is this the way this place is run?

265
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,400
Go and sell your eggs.
Get him out of here.

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,250
You never saw me before.

267
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,350
Sniper, stand by
to keep the flies off my back.

268
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,950
Seems to me if a man is worried about
the scartown of aces

269
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,840
the only thing a house can do
is spread the deck for him.

270
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,650
Easy, son. easy.

271
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,850
The house has no call but to be on the level.

272
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,700
They already have their percentage.

273
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,400
That's enough for
an honest gambler.

274
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,950
You're talking for me too, mister.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,450
He's talking for a lot of us.

276
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,450
- Light me.
- I don't carry matches.

277
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,150
Maybe you ought to.

278
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,050
You know what happens to
little boys playing with matches?

279
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,300
They do funny things
in the dark.

280
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,850
I'll make it easy for you.
Blackie, matches!

281
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,700
- Light me.
- It takes too many hands.

282
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,850
I keep mine where they
can do the most good.

283
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
You win.

284
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,300
I don't know these two dudes,

285
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,200
but I'm gonna see
that it stays a private fight.

286
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,800
- So simmer down.
- Thanks, whiskers.

287
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
But it ain't a private fight.

288
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,300
I talking for every man jack of you

289
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,100
who breaks his back all day
at honest work
and then comes in here at night

290
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,750
for a sociable game of cards.

291
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,800
Come here, sheriff.

292
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,800
I get too much lead in you lifebelt,
it may sink you.

293
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,630
Keep that pointed, whiskers, will you?

294
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,500
I know I had to shoot you
with your own gun.

295
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,950
But I'm gonna let you do it yourself.

296
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,450
We're gonna play a little game called
'Committing Suicide'.

297
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,550
- What are the rules?
- One of us shoots himself.

298
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,600
- The other?
- Laughs his sides off.

299
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,350
I'd like a good laugh.
Deal me a good hand.

300
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,000
I hold here one man size
portion of death.

301
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,800
I insert it in one of the 6
empty chambers of this gun.

302
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,750
I spin the cylinder, gentlemen, and
let the hammer fall where it may.

303
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,100
It may fire the first time the trigger is pulled...

304
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,550
or you may fire the last, or you may fire
anywhere in between.

305
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,700
Youdon'tknow, and I don't know.
But but we're gonna find out.

306
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,300
The  exciting way.

307
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,950
We toss for the privilege
of firing the first shot.

308
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,950
Heads or tails?

309
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,100
- Think carefully.
- Heads.

310
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,600
- The privilege is all yours.
- You're crazy, Brazos.

311
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,590
- All gamblers are crazy.
- I bet on the player.

312
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,300
You've got five chances out of six.

313
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,400
That's as good a bet
as a gambler ever have.

314
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,260
No, no. No peeking. Just...

315
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,700
Would you mind my asking
why you're doing this?

316
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,020
Because I believe in giving everybody
better than a square rule.

317
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,800
The odds are getting shorter.

318
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,950
You get three chances out of four.

319
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,110
Well, I'll make it two on a three for you.

320
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,100
It's an even money bet, now.

321
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,600
There are two pulls left.

322
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
And you go first.

323
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Go on, pick it up, it won't bite you.
Before you squeeze the trigger.

324
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,650
Come on, it's a clean honest deal,

325
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,200
the way any clean honest gambler
like you would  want it.

326
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,900
Come on, turn over the cards,
let's see the spots on them.

327
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,660
I would not do that if I were you.

328
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,350
First of all, you might end up
in front of a...

329
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,900
pack of indignant citizens,
waving a rope.

330
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,150
And second,  that could be the empty chamber.

331
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,000
and third, even if it wasn't
my bewhiskered friend here,

332
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,130
there would still be the last trick.

333
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,800
You can throw in your hand if you want to...

334
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,850
only it will cost you $ 5,000.

335
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,990
It's a  deal.

336
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,230
Blackie, get $ 5,000 out of the kitty.

337
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,780
Hand it to me, Blackie.
Come on, whiskers.

338
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,980
Let's go, Judge.

339
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,060
Think of the money you
could have saved.

340
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,200
Seems like old times when we did

341
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,600
most of our walking backwards.

342
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,010
Oh pardon me,
while I clean up my ears.

343
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,550
I saw you put a bullet in that gun.

344
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,800
You just thought you did.

345
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,000
It's the best trick I've
seen you do, Candy.

346
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,050
The hand is quicker than the eye.
Here's a souvenir for you.

347
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,900
When am I gonna get my cut
of our little joke, Candy?

348
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,200
Tomorrow. When you could see
to put it back where it belongs.

349
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,750
That money's too hard to get
without giving it away.

350
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,700
It is here.

351
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,500
REVEREND GENE VARNER

352
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:00,850
You sure picked a nice
respectable atmosphere, Judge.

353
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,700
You'd better mind your daughter,
before you get here like this, Judge.

354
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,750
- A very good evening to you, madam.
- Evening, Reverend.

355
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,400
-It's not my handle.
-No offense meant. I just believed in sign.

356
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,350
The late reverend was
Mrs. Varner's husband.

357
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,000
I only wish I was big enough
to fill his shoes.

358
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,050
With that gun in your hand,
you look  big enough

359
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,700
to fill almost anybody's shoes, Ma'm.

360
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,600
Come on in, Judge,
you've tired the young man.

361
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,250
Alongside of me, Madam,
this young man

362
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,800
is a teetotaler. - Hello, Papa.

363
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,550
My deepest apologies, my dear.

364
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,200
I'll help to get him to bed.

365
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,800
-You've done quite enough, Mr. Johnson. Come on!

366
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,650
Take you time tucking the man.

367
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,000
I won't move a muscle
until you get back.

368
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,800
Lisabeth and me are saying
good night, gents.

369
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,600
- See you in church.
- We ain't got a church in Yellow Creek.

370
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,350
- Only in Mose.
- Oh, heaven. That's too bad.

371
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,200
Could you use a church,
if you had one?

372
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,050
I'm no preacher.
Husband was, but I ain't.

373
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,350
I couldn't run no church.

374
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,900
How about the next best thing,
a mission maybe, eh?

375
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,950
If that be a decent place
for folks to go on Sunday anyway.

376
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,250
Sure.
Here's $ 1,500.

377
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,200
See that you have
one in jig time.

378
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,750
You're joking, mister?

379
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,850
I never joke with money in my hands.

380
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,850
You don't look to me like a man
would help the Lord

381
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,900
to beat the devil to .....

382
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,350
You can't tell by looking, honey.

383
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,250
You build a decent place for folks
to go on Sunday

384
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,100
and I build one for them on week days.

385
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,250
- What's that?
- A saloon where they can get good whiskey

386
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,810
and honest gambling. - Yes, Ma'm.

387
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,150
A place where every sucker
will get a square deal.

388
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,550
- You'll like our place.
- That's a mighty fine thing for you to do.

389
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,990
- You'll make your money's worth.
- I always do.

390
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,650
And remember, honey, it ain't
good manners to point.

391
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,450
- See you in the church.
- Oh, go on with you.

392
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,450
I'm young enough to
like that stuff

393
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,950
but too old to believe it.

394
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,250
Do not be so frisky
with this money.

395
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
- Next time, I...
- Come in and put that back.

396
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,200
- Oh Candy!
- You heard me. Put it back.

397
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,700
Okay, but I did not know
you really wanted her to keep it.

398
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,150
- Ma'm...
- What do you want?

399
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,400
- Nothing. I want to give you something.
- What?

400
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,200
My very best wishes, M'am.
My very best wishes.

401
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,440
That 'spellbinder' is still
downstairs waiting for you.

402
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,000
He is, is he?

403
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,750
Honey! Looks like you've
got your towel over a line.

404
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,800
If you mean I don't like
that 'spellbinder' you're right.

405
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,250
Funny, I do.
A guy like that reminds me
of a piece of side pork:

406
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,850
streak of fat, streak of lean,

407
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,900
streak of good, streak of mean.

408
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,100
Personally, I'm a vegetarian.

409
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,550
Don't look so disappointed, honey.
I'm still here.

410
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,850
Mr. Johnson, I've come down to tell you
that you're on the wrong side of town.

411
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,650
I think the two sides
are to get together.

412
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,600
I don't.

413
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,250
Stay away from me
and stay away from my father.

414
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,050
We've got nothing to do with you.

415
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,100
Wedon'tlike anything about you
and we have nothing in common.

416
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,750
I thought the judge
kind of liked me.

417
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,700
Unfortunately, my father
sees good in everyone.

418
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:28,150
He would not recognize a weasel,
even if it had stripes down its back.

419
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,750
-That's a skunk, honey.

420
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,700
-All I just hope is that I've made myself clear...

421
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,150
and that you understand me
as well as I understand you.

422
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
But you don't understand me, honey.

423
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,100
I know what I thought when
I took that first long look at you.

424
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,950
I'm afraid I do.

425
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,900
I thought, 'There's a highly
respectable spinster...

426
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,100
a real  blue-blooded lady'.

427
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,500
- Red blood, Mr. Johnson.
- From Boston?

428
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,100
Everybody in my family
had red blood.

429
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,800
By the time my great-grandfather
was through a Bunkerhill

430
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,700
he was running out of holes in his boots.

431
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,350
Fancy boots too, I bet.

432
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,150
They were good strong boots.
He made them himself.

433
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,150
You mean the boy was a shoemaker?

434
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,250
What is wrong with
being a shoemaker?

435
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,900
Not a thing, honey.

436
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,380
I'm just happy to know that
we're the same kind of people.

437
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,650
What makes you think
we're the same kind of people?

438
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,850
What makes you think we're not?

439
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,530
I want you to stay away from me,
Mr. Johnson.

440
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,700
No, you don't.

441
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,550
Whydon'tyou jump in
and get wet all over?

442
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,950
You'd feel better.

443
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,050
I was always  taught
to turn the other cheek.

444
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,050
Right here.

445
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,820
Well, what ails you?
What did that fool say to you?

446
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,850
- He kissed me.
- He what?

447
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,050
Four times.

448
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,160
Why did not you stop him after first one,
or the very latest the second?

449
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,100
I don't know.

450
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,650
I ought to spin him all over the road.

451
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,650
He thinks he can fool around my boarders
just because he gave me enough money

452
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,150
to build a church.

453
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,450
A church?

454
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,800
Well, maybe you were
right about him.

455
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,550
Maybe, honey, but remember,
you're a vegetarian.

456
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,920
Well, good night.

457
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,200
- Give me a joe, Frank.

458
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,950
- Seems you covered  all expenses last night.
Not bad 24 hours.

459
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,750
I'd trade her for
a cold egg and a case right now.

460
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,500
Hi, Candy.

461
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,800
The beard, Pearl, close.

462
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,470
Dude, we got a customer.

463
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,650
Kind of shaky, eh, Blackie?

464
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,050
As shaky as your job here.

465
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,750
I'm getting to feel quite at home.

466
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,300
All these familiar faces.

467
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,050
You come in for a shave?

468
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,840
We are giving them close today
for souvenirs.

469
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,450
Kind of flimsy.

470
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,450
An old match could do
a lot of good around here.

471
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,800
That's right.
It could burn the pants off
of a gent about your size.

472
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,100
I wouldn't count on it.
I'm fireproof.

473
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,850
Boss, you took that dude's business
and he didn't like it.

474
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,500
He's just yapping.

475
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,450
No, he isn't Candy,
he is not gonna take this land on.

476
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,550
Forget it, honey.

477
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,450
Get round boys like I told you.

478
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,600
Tell them I said it's Sunday school time.

479
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,150
Speaking of Sunday school,
I got a new hat

480
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,500
with no place to wear.

481
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,600
It's got violets on it, little shy violets
from Boston.

482
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,950
Go ahead, Pearl.

483
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,550
Get me ready  to atone for
last week sins.

484
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,800
If you can atone real hard
maybe it can take your next week' too.

485
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,300
My late husband, Reverend Varner,

486
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,200
would've liked this little house

487
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,500
he'd have done...

488
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,200
he'd  have done a lot of good here

489
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,800
and maybe we can, too.

490
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,550
It ain't a church yet, but it
wouldn't take much to make it one.

491
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,300
Only I'm bound to say
I never expected to see

492
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,850
some of these faces in a place like this.

493
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,480
not less than laying in a casket.

494
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,200
I hear a fellow named
Candy Johnson

495
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,700
opened up a different
kind of a place yesterday.

496
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,700
And he also chucked away the key
so there ain't gonna be any lock on its door.

497
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,450
Well I'm gonna run my outfit the same way.

498
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,650
The door will never be locked against you.

499
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Eh, let me ask you something.

500
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,500
How much are gonna charge
for a beer when you get this place going?

501
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,050
You've got the wrong idea, mister.
Everything we have is free of charge.

502
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,300
Maybe it's all it's worth.
We'll only get here a lot of gab.

503
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,250
-Shame!
-Maybe the guy's right.

504
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,450
Listen, mister. This is
no place to start a rubbish.

505
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,550
You be quiet or out you go.

506
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,750
All right, you get the floor.

507
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,500
Let's see what you have to say.

508
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,300
Speech!

509
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,550
They seem to want to listen to you, Mr Johnson.

510
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,750
And it ain't a bad idea seen as
how you made this place possible.

511
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,750
Speak up!

512
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,600
Speech! Speech!

513
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,780
All right, mister. I did not think
I had anything to say.

514
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,800
But since I've been looking at you
I believe I've got a lot.

515
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,220
Why don't you come up here
where it's  comfortable.

516
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,350
Oh Ma'am, if you came to my place,
I wouldn't get behind the bar, would you?

517
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,800
Ladies and gents, I'm
going to give you the goods

518
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,700
When I 'm talking, I always like to
have something in my hands.

519
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,810
- How do you do? Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

520
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,050
I'm going to give you
the goods on the onriest citizen

521
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,800
west of the Mississippi, folks.
It's Mr. John Barleycorn.

522
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,800
I used to think I could give old John
a big casino

523
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,300
and still beat him.

524
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,700
But he knew me better
than I knew myself.

525
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,100
You see, I like the stuff.

526
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,550
After the first drink
I couldn't help taking the second.

527
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,850
After the second
I reached for the third.

528
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,300
And after the third
I just kept on reaching without counting.

529
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,000
I went loco.
When I woke up,
I found trouble

530
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,400
sitting on the bed post
waiting for me.

531
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,400
If you'd  like my home remedy
to keep from taking this first drink

532
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,500
here it is, folk. Candy.

533
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,250
Outside  of a woman's lips
it's sweetest thing on earth.

534
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,300
Good for the nerves.

535
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,150
Steadies the hand and
clears the eye.

536
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,550
May I ask you something?
Why are you talking against liquor?

537
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,000
You sell it, don't you?

538
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,950
I'm glad you asked
that question, my friend.

539
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,100
A long time ago I found out
that no matter what I said

540
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,400
I could not stop some men from drinking.

541
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,800
The same as I couldn't
stop them from gambling.

542
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,600
So I figured they'd
better have honest gambling

543
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,600
and good liquor.

544
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,350
That's why I opened
the Square Deal saloon.

545
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,700
The only place you can be sure
they cut the cards

546
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,050
and not the liquor.

547
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,150
But one honest saloon and
a mission isn't enough

548
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,600
to a smooth running town.

549
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,050
What you ought to have
is a school for your kids.

550
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,200
Yes, and a fire engine to use

551
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,200
when the kids try
to burn it up.

552
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,500
Mr. Johnson, I'm very glad

553
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,350
that you asked
to walk home with me.

554
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,720
Thank you, Miss. Cotton.
I'm very glad you accepted.

555
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,450
I think there is something
I should tell you.

556
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,450
I'm almost sure
that I've misjudged you.

557
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Well, if you're not
in too much of a hurry

558
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,000
I'll do my best
to make you real sure.

559
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,650
I never did like
to walk too fast.

560
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,750
You know, I'm beginning to get
a lot better line on you, too, honey.

561
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,200
It's a beautiful night, isn't it Mr Johnson?

562
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:13,927
Yes. And it's not getting any worse.

563
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,100
Have you any idea
what a girl like you

564
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,750
can do to a gent like me?

565
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,350
I 'd like to know.
Tell me.

566
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,100
I've seen women
I looked at quicker

567
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,600
but never one I looked at longer.

568
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,210
That's a good start.
Go on.

569
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,100
You're a runt.

570
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
I could put you
in my vest pocket

571
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,050
and lose you in the small change.

572
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,150
And me now. I've always
gone for women

573
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,300
with something too of my kind
that could stand up

574
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,700
and slug it out with me,
toe to toe.

575
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,250
- You slug me just by looking at me.
- I'm sorry.

576
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,200
- But I'm not sorry. - Yeah.

577
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,750
And your eyes, they are green,
and that always means hard
to get along with.

578
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,750
That's not true.
I have a wonderful disposition.

579
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,200
- And you've got brains,
that ain't womanly.

580
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,400
That's a lie,
I have no brain in my head.

581
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,700
You have a full set
of Boston principles

582
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,500
which you are about as easy
on a man, as a hair-shirt.

583
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:17,450
Can you tell me something?
Why do I keep coming back for more?

584
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,900
You've told me why.
Very sweetly.

585
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,650
What?
Say that again slow.

586
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,450
I know 'sweet' is a funny
word to use about you.

587
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,450
But you are.

588
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,350
I take it back, honey. I wouldn't
have you an inch taller.

589
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,680
Look, I think it's time that
I went in house.

590
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,100
I never saw a girl so willing
to  let it go at talk.

591
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,750
Talk?

592
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,900
I thought it was your specialty,
Mr Johnson.

593
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,000
A very nice talk too,
as far as it went.

594
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Yes, but a man has got
to stop talking some time.

595
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,250
Not until he said
some very important things.

596
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,950
Well, good night, Mr. Johnson.

597
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,000
- Hey, wait!
- Good night.

598
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,400
How can you sleep in here, Candy,
with that mess out there?

599
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,950
Tinkle of the cash-register
soothes my dream.

600
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,950
Judge, I recommend
you have to do now...

601
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,650
is to grab  Kendall and Adam.

602
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,400
Kendall and Adam.
They are good men.

603
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,300
We can use them
round election time.

604
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,800
I hear they're gone right over there,
what can I promise them here?

605
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,250
You tell them no matter
what they're getting over there

606
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,100
is chicken feed compared to what
their take will be around here.

607
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,800
OK, Candy.
I'm as good as there.

608
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,350
And Judge?
Ride the water wagon over there.

609
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,100
I'll try my best.
I took the pledge.

610
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:52,550
That new Farrow dealer.
I thought he was crooked, took...

611
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,100
You couldn't wait to send
for  Kendall and Adams?

612
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,100
That's right.

613
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
It isn't them you can't wait for.

614
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
-No?
-No.

615
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,100
You're all set to take over every asset
in town, except one.

616
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,050
If you don't take that one over
it's gonna take you.

617
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,100
I've never thought that a woman
could upset you, Candy man.

618
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,860
- How do you know it's a woman?
- Because I'm a woman.

619
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,100
Well, I guess it's time
to open that door and...

620
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,850
and when you go out this time
I'm gonna lock it.

621
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,300
OK, honey. But leave
the key under the mat.

622
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,500
I'm gonna throw the key away.

623
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,100
When a gent like you gets
married, he gets good and married.

624
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,200
A gent like me don't get married.

625
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,700
Then a gent like you don't take over
that asset.

626
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,850
To keep a man get the dinner ready

627
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,300
as soon as a man is caught.

628
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,100
- Anybody home?
- Come in, whoever it is

629
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,500
and wash your hands and feet.

630
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,750
Well, come in, honey, come in.

631
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,350
Thanks.

632
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,050
- Hello! - Good afternoon.

633
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,700
That depends on the way
you are sitting

634
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,200
and what cards you hold.

635
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,150
Well, then I'd say it's
a very  good-afternoon.

636
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,650
Sit down, won't you.

637
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,700
I don't suppose you've got
any whiskey around.

638
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,750
Maybe I have, honey.

639
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,900
That drink has not been cut
since that snipe last night.

640
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,700
Mrs. Varnes is teaching me
how to cook...

641
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,800
Western style.

642
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,600
Here the water takes three times
to come to a boil.

643
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,800
That's only true
of a cooking, honey.

644
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:53,700
You know, I'm like Candy: when I talk, I like
to have something in my hands.

645
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Yes sir, Candy man sure can talk.

646
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,200
A great salesman.

647
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,500
The only trouble is
he's selling just one thing:

648
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,500
Candy Johnson.

649
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:07,000
I'll say this one though:
he don't hand out any guarantees.

650
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,700
How can you say that?
He has a sign right over his door:

651
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,300
''The Square Deal''.

652
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,900
He's got a different sign on his chest.
One that tells the truth.

653
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,100
But it's in smaller letters.

654
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,600
You seem to have read this sign yourself.

655
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,900
Would  you mind telling me
what it says?

656
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,000
With the greatest pleasure.
Honey, it says:

657
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,300
- I'm not the kind of a gent
that stays put,

658
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,650
some day, I'm gonna point myself at that door '

659
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,500
and keep right on going. ''

660
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,740
And believe me, sister.
He is a man of his word.

661
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,650
Well, it's time for me to say
I've got something to do upstairs.

662
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,850
But you ain't.
So long, ladies.

663
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,950
If you need a referee, holler.

664
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,200
Just what are you trying to say?

665
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,400
Something that you won't have
sense enough to know.

666
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,500
Candy Johnson is not the marrying kind.

667
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,850
My aunt Sara used to say
that when a man says
he isn't the marrying type

668
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,000
it only meant that
he wasn't married yet.

669
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,490
Maybe in Boston, but this
is Yellow Creek, Nevada.

670
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,970
You know, I think you came here
because you're jealous.

671
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,950
You want more? Right now I've got
20 bucks to snatch you both of it

672
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,500
Why should I believe
anything you say?

673
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,700
I guess you shouldn't but

674
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,200
you don't really think that Candy man
has a wedding ring all picked out, do you?

675
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,350
Why shouldn't I?
What else would he be picking out?

676
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,450
A fancy room in a fancy hotel, honey.

677
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,300
And he won't be renting it
by the month either.

678
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,700
Being a rat
thirsty work.

679
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,400
-Hello, honey.
-Good evening.

680
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,360
I like this country.

681
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,700
This depends on
where you are sitting
and what cards you hold.

682
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,450
-Doesn't it?
-What?

683
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,800
Candy, I'm glad you're here.

684
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,950
I'm sure I couldn't have slept
at night without seeing him.

685
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,400
You know, I haven't been sleeping so good myself.

686
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,850
The quicker we get something settled

687
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,800
the quicker we'll both get some rest.

688
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,150
Every time I look at you
it hits me again

689
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,700
you're  prettier than a little white
kitten, with a blue ribbon on it.

690
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,400
Candy, you know,
I've been thinking this evening.

691
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,800
I do a lot of thinking .

692
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,950
About courtship.
Boston courtship.

693
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,900
They are never shorter than a year and
sometimes they go on for 3 or 4.

694
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,600
Say me, I haven't got
that much time, honey.

695
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,400
You hustle upstairs and pack yourself a bag.
We're going to Sacramento tonight.

696
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:01,000
And when you're packing that bag
don't put any wrong ideas into it.

697
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,350
Such as?

698
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,950
Well, I'm a citizen like this.

699
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,400
I like to know
that every door works both ways.

700
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,950
When I walk in, I gotta
know that I can walk out.

701
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,650
You do wear a sign
on your chest, don't you?
- What?

702
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,130
Nothing.

703
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,550
Look. Suppose I don't
go to Sacramento.

704
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,050
Well, I 'm gonna get you out of my mind

705
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,450
if I have to hire a man with a gun

706
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
to keep me away from  you.

707
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,750
I told you what to
leave out of that bag.

708
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,700
Now I'll tell you what
to put into it.

709
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:39,250
- Anything with ribbons on it.
- Anything you say, Candy.

710
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,060
Do you know why?

711
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,840
I've got a rough idea,
but I'd like you to hear you say it.

712
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,700
Because a gent like you
can do anything to a girl like me.

713
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,300
Anything

714
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,250
You'll knock them dead
in Sacramento, honey.

715
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,750
First of all, I'm gonna get you
a whole floor at the Sierra Palace.

716
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,800
A fancy room in a fancy hotel.

717
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,900
We'll buy all the town.

718
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,650
I've been aching to dress you
like you ought to be:

719
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,300
Plenty of plumes, black lace stockings

720
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,350
and a whole handful of diamonds in your hair.

721
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,950
A handful of diamonds in my hair.

722
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,400
What girl could want
more than that?

723
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,660
Let's drink to that.

724
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,450
Here we are.

725
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,950
This is Mrs. Varner's special remedy
for sprains and bruises.

726
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,300
- I forgot, you can't drink.
- I can, but don't.

727
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,700
I did so want to drink
to the diamonds and plumes.

728
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,350
But...

729
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,100
This will do. You know,
you must be used to it by now.

730
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,150
But I can fill it with
something much stronger, like milk.

731
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,350
Well well. Come on, Candy.

732
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,700
I understand it's not okay
to let anyone to drink alone.

733
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,300
You're making me look
like a sucker from Boston.

734
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,350
No, you're from Yellow Creek.
It's good for the nerves...

735
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,650
steadies the hand and clears the eye.

736
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:57,550
Candy, you're not just trying
to impress me, are you?

737
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,950
Like a little boy
walking on his hands?

738
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,200
Here's to the girl from Bostonl.

739
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,500
And here's to the gent from Yellow Creek,
and to the diamonds and the flumes.

740
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,150
Come on, honey. Let's get going.

741
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,600
Oh no, wait. We mustn't forget
the black lace stockings.

742
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,400
Candy, this is  the second drink.
Do you really think you should?

743
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,150
-Here's to you and me.
-And to the black lace stockings.

744
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:39,650
Candy Johnson, what's
your real name, Candy?

745
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,650
I guess I know you
well enough to tell you,

746
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,560
but you don't know me
well enough to laugh.

747
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:53,360
It's Jederiah. Jederiah Johnson.

748
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,700
Well, I know you well enough to smile.

749
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,350
Here's to knocking them
dead in Sacramento.

750
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,450
With a gent like you.

751
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:17,520
And here's to the Sierra Palace,
with a girl like you.

752
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,750
Candy, that's your third drink.

753
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:24,350
You don't want to wake up and find
trouble sitting on the bedpost

754
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,060
do you?

755
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,250
Who are you?

756
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,500
Trouble?

757
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,950
- What?

758
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,150
Don't you remember?

759
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,100
You always find it sitting on the bed-post
after you've been drinking.

760
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,050
How did we get to Sacramento, honey?

761
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,670
We didn't.
This is my room.

762
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,800
It looks like you.
Everything in its right place.

763
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,250
Including me.

764
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
I've got a compliment for you:

765
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,150
You are prettier this morning
than you were last night.

766
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,200
And I have a compliment for you:

767
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,150
you were much prettier last night
than you are this morning.

768
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,200
Candy, do you kiss with
your eyes open or closed?

769
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,500
Open, honey.
I don't want to miss anything.

770
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,000
That's fine. Because I wouldn't
want you to miss anything.

771
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,590
- Did I miss something?
- That depends on how much you remember.

772
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,600
I don't know.

773
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,450
Men can do a lot of things
they don't remember.

774
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,150
That depends on how
intoxicated he was.

775
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,450
What I want to know is
how d' you feel about me
this morning?

776
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,200
Exactly as I felt about you last night.

777
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,250
- What about breakfast?
-I've had mine.

778
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,300
Maybe I'll walk to him.

779
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,200
If you're looking for a door, it's that
thing over there with a knob on it.

780
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,200
And it works both ways.

781
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,450
What a shame!

782
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,850
We had so much fun
building it last night.

783
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,450
You were so happy.

784
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,450
-Happy? How was I  happy?
-You were singing.

785
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,020
- Did I sing good? - Well,

786
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,350
I did not care for the voice,
but the sermon was beautiful.

787
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,650
That's good! After the third drink
I don't  usually sing hymns.

788
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:02,200
It wasn't  a hymn, Candy.
It was "Here comes the bride''.

789
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,050
Where did you get that?

790
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,850
You had difficulty finding
the proper finger.

791
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,100
You felt it should go on my thumb.

792
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,100
- Good morning, Mrs. Johnson.
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.

793
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,100
You sure went to a lot of trouble last night
to make it Mister and Mistress.

794
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,200
Oh no. The only trouble I had
was with Mrs. Varner.

795
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,200
She did not want to get
the town clerk perform the ceremony.

796
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,250
But you were quite agreeable.
After the third drink.

797
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,150
Yes, you sure went to a lot of trouble.

798
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,250
How did you know it wouldn't be
Mr. and Mrs. in Sacramento, too?

799
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,190
Don't start talking.

800
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,600
Maybe I got conned into this
marriage, and maybe I didn't.

801
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,250
But, anyway, we're married.

802
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,050
No. Stop talking.

803
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,100
I've heard that all brides are nervous.

804
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,850
I'm not nervous!

805
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,700
Too bad we did not have
those long Boston courtships.

806
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,350
In 3 or 4 years now, you'd have been
as cool as as a cucumber.

807
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,000
We are going to have
one of those long Boston courtships.

808
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,750
The only difference is that it
starts after the wedding.

809
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,250
I'm going to have respect
from you, Candy Johnson.

810
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,650
That ain't why you married me, honey.

811
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,400
You are going to change.

812
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,350
You didn't go to all that trouble
just to reform me, did you?

813
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,050
Maybe I did.

814
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,310
All right.

815
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:52,200
I'll reform during the day.

816
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:59,400
It'll make me busy until
almost 9:00 p.m tonight.

817
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,410
No ribbons.

818
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,100
Bring me a gallon of
coffee, 4 eggs and bacon.

819
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,550
- Send the coffee first.
- Sure, boss.

820
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,000
Sniper, take my hand.

821
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,550
Watch this beard, boys, it's alive.

822
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,630
- What are you playing, boy?
Poker?

823
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,370
Right. Hurry up with  groceries.

824
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,950
Well, you walked in here like a fellow
who took over all the assets up here.

825
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,300
You look like a fellow who got took.

826
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,000
Look harder, honey.

827
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,150
When was the last time
I got took?

828
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,050
We married last night.

829
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,620
- Two, isn't it?
-Yes. Thank you.

830
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,530
Well, I've heard of fellows
being sent to jail, I...

831
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,050
never heard of them breaking in.

832
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,300
That depends on the fellow.

833
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,100
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

834
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,100
Here comes your father-in-law.
I think I'll leave that up to him.

835
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,700
Hey, Judge.

836
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,990
Come in
I want to talk to you.

837
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,030
Oh, coming.

838
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,300
You two ought to  have a lot
to say to each other.

839
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,450
Hello, Candy. Well. I got everything fixed.

840
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,450
Kendall and Adams will be
on tap tomorrow. - Fine.

841
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,100
You can see how dry
that water wagon was.

842
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,500
Have one on the house.

843
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,500
Even in my prime
I never drank before breakfast.

844
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,450
Sit down.

845
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,900
I really ought to go right
home to  Elisabeth.

846
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,700
I'm getting her out of this town, Candy.

847
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,750
I'm sending her back
to Boston this week.

848
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,550
I don't think she will go, Judge.

849
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,750
I'll insist on it.
This is no place for her.

850
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,540
- Here, have some breakfast.
-Thank you.

851
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:27,350
This is the first time you ever
pressed a drink on me. Why?

852
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,050
I want to drink to your retirement.

853
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,950
When a man reaches your age,

854
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,600
being Justice of the peace
is enough for him to worry about.

855
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,350
Now when you get your cut
you won't do anything for it.

856
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:45,500
Only a sucker expects to get
something for nothing. Why?

857
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,940
Well, put it down
to  family sentiment.

858
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,880
Elisabeth and me were
married last night.

859
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,550
You...

860
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,100
I don't know why I
carry the thing.

861
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,100
I couldn't even shoot a dog.

862
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,810
Here. Have your drink.

863
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:28,320
I'm gonna hate you
as long as I live.

864
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,450
Hello, Judge.
You have a good trip?

865
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,950
-Is Elisabeth upstairs?
-Yeah.

866
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,900
-Elisabeth, your Pa is here.
- I'm coming down.

867
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,800
Sit down, Judge.
I'll pour you a cup of coffee.

868
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,200
I got some on the back of the stove that
will grow hair on your teeth.

869
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,150
Hello, Papa.

870
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,750
Well my dear...

871
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,600
I understand you've just made
the biggest mistake of your life.

872
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,230
You know about Candy?

873
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,700
I'm sorry you had to hear about it
from somebody else.

874
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,830
Come sit down.

875
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,450
I'm going to tell you something
that I should have

876
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,450
told you a long time ago.

877
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:32,350
Candy Johnson is a cheat,
and a liar and a thief.

878
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,950
Please, Papa, don't.

879
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,400
Maybe there's something
wrong with Candy,

880
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,950
Maybe I know there is

881
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,300
but he'll  change.
I know he will.

882
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,350
Your mother tried to change me, Elisabeth.

883
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,650
She was still trying
the day he died.

884
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Don't you believe
people can change?

885
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,700
Not people like Candy Johnson.

886
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,000
I know because we are both cut
from the same piece of shaley cloth.

887
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,000
I hoped I'd never have
to tell you this.

888
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,050
It will catch you between the eyes.

889
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,950
And maybe that's what you need.

890
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:17,500
I'm a cheap crook
with a respectable front.

891
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,200
I was born that way
and I'll die that way.

892
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,350
Looking after myself, no matter
what it costs anyone else.

893
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,700
And so will Candy. He'll never
do anything but hurt you.

894
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,350
We'll never change,
except for the worse.

895
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,950
I wish Mother could
have heard you just now.

896
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,600
She'd know that she did not fail.

897
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:43,350
I weren't just looking after yourself,
you were trying to help me.

898
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,000
No matter what it cost you.

899
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,750
I'm afraid you're just
like your mother.

900
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,850
What's going on in here?
Anything I should know?

901
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,700
Elisabeth has been telling me
how make

902
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,050
a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

903
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,750
We're going to be proud
of Candy some day, Papa.

904
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,150
Judge, everybody's kid's got
to grow up and get married some day.

905
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,950
But not to Candy Johnson.

906
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,850
She will never change him
and if he changes her...

907
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,150
I'll ...

908
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,950
You're wrong about him, Judge.

909
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,200
Most folks think ////
to go around.

910
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,850
I thought that handkerchief was pretty keen.

911
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,250
I haven't got my key, Mrs. Varner.
Where is Mrs. Johnson?

912
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,400
Up there.

913
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,700
Not going your path.

914
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,300
Right about this time I thought
what a handsome corpse you'd make.

915
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,150
Don't say that, honey.
I've got a lot to live for.

916
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,400
Take it easy and
you'll  live longer.

917
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,100
-Who's that?
-It's me. Jederiah.

918
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,700
What do you want?

919
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:23,290
I said, what do you want?
What are you doing out there?

920
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,600
At the moment I'm trying
to cook up an answer.

921
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,450
It shouldn't be very
difficult for you, Mr Johnson.

922
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,250
I don't feel like talking now, honey.

923
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,250
Besides, this is a public place out here.

924
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,900
That's very unfortunate

925
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,400
because this is one time
that I really feel like listening.

926
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,200
Besides, this is a very
private place in here.

927
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,200
Say, couldn't you hear me a lot better

928
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,200
if we got  all this wood out
from in between us?

929
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Well, so far you haven't said
very much. I hear you perfectly.

930
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,700
Maybe you were right, about
that Boston courtship stuff, honey.

931
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,700
Now you're beginning to say something.

932
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,900
You were right. A girl
ought to have a breathing spell...

933
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,150
to find out about the gent
she's going to marry.

934
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,800
But you know more
about me than most folk.

935
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,200
Now, for instance, you know
my real handle.

936
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,850
Go on, Mr. Johnson.

937
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,600
Well, I was born in Chatanooga.

938
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,900
I like this courtship, Mr Johnson.

939
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:28,400
It wasn't always ''Mr. Johnson".
They used to call me just plain Fatty.

940
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,300
I got the name Fatty
my first day at school.

941
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,800
Did you like school, Candy?
Did you get good marks?

942
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,940
I didn't go to school very long.

943
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:41,620
Why? Did you have to stop
to go to work?

944
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,800
Yes, that was it.
I had to help out at home.

945
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,850
Even after I ran away, I always
sent something home every week.

946
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,550
How old were you then, Candy?

947
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:58,130
16. But I was big
for my age.

948
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,130
How big were you?

949
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,750
Big enough to let me get by.
Can I come in now, honey?

950
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,700
Try sitting down
peeking through the keyhole.

951
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,050
Did you always get by, Candy?

952
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:17,600
Yes, but just getting by did not
satisfy me for long.

953
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,150
It had to be better than getting by.

954
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,550
I never was one to stand outside
scratching on doors.

955
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,200
I don't know what
I'm doing here now.

956
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,700
This courtship is over.

957
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,200
If you keep knocking on
the door, this marriage is over.

958
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,850
I've been listening to you, Candy Johnson,
and that's always a mistake.

959
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,750
Courtship! A fine idea of courtship  you have.

960
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:38,300
Who cares
if you ran away from home?

961
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,300
Who cares if they used to call you Fatty?

962
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,750
What a woman wants
to know about a man

963
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,200
is that he has decent honorable emotions.

964
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,550
I've got decent honorable emotions.

965
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,950
Stop scratching on that door.
You can't come in!

966
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,700
I just came in to say good night, Mrs. Johnson.

967
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,150
And you can forget about that key.

968
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,350
What would you need a key for?

969
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,750
Candy! Candy Johnson,
you come right back here.

970
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:22,250
Boss! Boss! Me fix
a wedding cake for you.

971
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:24,250
Thanks, Ching, you eat it.

972
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,850
Slow down, it's
past your bed time, honey?

973
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,150
Maybe he couldn't sleep
without the tinkle of the cash-register.

974
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,100
How would you like to come
to my wedding ceremony?

975
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,350
Will bride be up there?

976
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:35,400
No. She asked me
to get somebody to take her place.

977
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,000
All right.

978
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,650
Take a couple of steaks and a
bottle of beer for the lady.

979
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,450
Yes, boss.

980
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:46,050
I sure like a man
who can order a good meal.

981
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,700
Hi,  sweetheart.

982
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,710
Excuse me.
Where's Mr. Johnson, please?

983
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,550
-He's in there.
-Thank you.

984
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:15,100
- I'm sorry, Candy is out, Ma'am.
- I know he isn't.

985
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,500
- He's busy.
- He'll be busier.

986
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,200
Go away!

987
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,350
Get away from that door!

988
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:39,000
Well, I'm glad I did not
have to break it down.

989
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,600
Two of us are having a little wedding supper.

990
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:46,200
Why don't you make it a crowd?

991
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,000
I certainly will.

992
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,500
Order me a steak, too.
Oh, and a bottle of beer.

993
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,850
Are you sure you'd
like our steak, honey?

994
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:57,450
You know, we eat them rare
and that isn't not Boston style.

995
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,400
My great grandfather used to eat them raw.
On the hooks.

996
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:04,150
He'd never cut time in Nevada,
our cows wouldn't stand still for it.

997
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,300
You don't know
her ancestors, my dear.

998
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,450
The old boy probably took
the horns in one hand and tail in the other

999
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,250
and  began to eat it
like a mere corn.

1000
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,000
- What about your ancestors?
-They didn't eat beef.

1001
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
They ruffled them.

1002
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,900
In-law trouble already?

1003
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:19,450
Only with the relations
on my husband's side.

1004
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,650
Candy isn't any relation of mine,
he's just a friend.

1005
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,350
An old friend.

1006
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,650
I'm sure you can't be
such an old friend, my dear.

1007
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,300
You hardly know anything about him.

1008
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,100
Maybe. But if I told
all I know...

1009
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,650
he'd be in jail.
-And so would you, honey.

1010
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,040
- Then of course, you know
where he was born.
Sure. El Paso.

1011
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,379
- Chatanooga, my dear.
- El Paso.

1012
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,550
I suppose you know
ran away from home.
In Chatanooga.

1013
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,400
He did not run away,
they kicked him out of
El Paso.

1014
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,100
Either way, it was St. Louis.

1015
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,900
I'm sure, they couldn't have '
kicked him out.

1016
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,900
He was such a nice little boy.

1017
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,550
In case you don't know,
they called him Fatty.

1018
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,400
In case you don't know,
they called him Little Stinky.

1019
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,410
- Fatty.
- Believe me, Little Stinky.

1020
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,200
- What did they call you?
-You want the truth?

1021
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,900
They called me Big Stinky.

1022
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:29,100
Well, Candy man, thank you
for the beef steak.

1023
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,750
The next time I go
to a wedding supper

1024
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,850
I'll get me a husband first.

1025
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,470
Why did you tell her
the truth and lied to me?

1026
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,950
It's not my fault if I can't
slug it out with you toe to toe.

1027
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,100
I didn't want to be born in Boston.
It just happened.

1028
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,800
And I can't help
about that green in my eyes.

1029
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,400
I am just as good-looking as she is,
and I have just as good a figure.

1030
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,750
Maybe even better.
I can walk like she does.

1031
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,200
If that's what you want.

1032
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:05,600
I can smoke and I can drink.

1033
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,450
What else can you do?

1034
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:15,070
I haven't had much practice, but...

1035
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,570
but I can kiss a man.

1036
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,950
Practice.

1037
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:36,730
- I want to go home, Candy.
- You are home.

1038
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:26,100
- Don't tell me that's Trouble, Candy.
You married Trouble, honey.

1039
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,600
Come here and kiss me, Trouble.

1040
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,650
Will you be there
in the morning when I wake up?

1041
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:38,950
- If that's how you want it.
- That's how I want it

1042
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,050
till I stop waking up.

1043
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,800
Why worry about
the next 50 years?

1044
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:45,400
We're here now, aren't we?

1045
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:50,050
I am worried, Candy.
This gun, must you wear it?

1046
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:53,350
Black isn't becoming
to  brides, honey.

1047
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:57,600
Please, Candy, leave
the belt home today.

1048
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,900
- Please.
- You \\\.

1049
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:08,700
That's him. For 100 bucks
he stole by poker that night.

1050
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:12,400
Look, he hasn't got his gun.
You don't have to wait for dark.

1051
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,600
Go after him now. Pick a fight with him,
say he cheated you.

1052
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,950
No sir, I don't shoot an unarmed men.

1053
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,850
I got a prejudice
against getting myself lynched.

1054
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,900
What are you talking about?

1055
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,500
You don't know
if he hasn't  got a gun, do you?

1056
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,900
Get going.

1057
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,200
They are nice and fancy.
Do you think they are big enough?

1058
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,300
You nothing about feet,
and even less about women.

1059
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,350
Always ask whether the shoes
are small enough.

1060
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,150
Hey, Johnson!

1061
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,250
They've cheated me in your joint.

1062
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,200
They took my weak side.

1063
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,550
I'm glad to listen you
squawk, Mister.

1064
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,900
I'm trough squawking.

1065
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,900
Gun, Mister.

1066
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,550
I got nothing against you,
you got nothing against me...

1067
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,000
that can't be ironed out.

1068
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,600
I'm giving you every chance.
Draw!

1069
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,140
Wait a minute, I've got my wife here.

1070
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,600
Candy, are you all right?

1071
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,250
This is the first time
I couldn't talk my way out.

1072
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,950
Oh Candy, and I wanted you
to leave your gun at home.

1073
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,750
That's all right, honey.
I did leave the belt at home.

1074
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,630
Dead as a door-nail.

1075
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,300
The man was killed in cold blood.
Here's the killer.

1076
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,150
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What would you suggest, Sheriff?

1077
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,050
If nobody thinks his feet
are too close to the ground

1078
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,250
I'm putting him in jail.

1079
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,200
So I can be shot
while escaping, eh?

1080
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,850
It was self-defense.
It was self-defense.

1081
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,000
It was murder.

1082
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:38,900
The lady is right.
I saw the whole thing.

1083
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,520
Who else saw?

1084
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:41,600
- I saw.
- I saw.

1085
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,050
The dude pointed his '46 gun,

1086
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:45,450
and the big fellow here
just naturally beat him to the draw.

1087
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:48,150
You ought to never open your mouth,
except to eat.

1088
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,600
Friends, I appreciate
your clearing me.

1089
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,400
But what's happens to me
isn't important.

1090
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:55,200
It's what happens to this town.

1091
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:58,900
- There's a man lying dead in the wool.
- You killed him.

1092
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,900
I'll take your gun.

1093
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,750
This man could've been me,
it could've been you.

1094
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:02,750
Any of us.

1095
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:05,150
If Yellow Creek's ever
going to amount to anything, folks,

1096
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,300
we'd better make it safe
for a man to go out

1097
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,750
and get himself a breath of fresh air

1098
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,550
without getting into a shooting scrape.

1099
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,050
A man's gotta carry a gun

1100
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,900
in a town where there's
no law or order.

1101
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,850
No law and order, eh?

1102
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:18,350
You ever stopped to figure out
why you haven't got it?

1103
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:21,150
- Who elected this gent sheriff any way?

1104
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:23,500
- I elected myself, unanimously.

1105
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:26,100
He just pinned on a star and
started giving orders.

1106
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:28,150
Do you still want him to
go on giving orders?

1107
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:30,140
No!

1108
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,300
Brazos, sounds like
you've just been fired.

1109
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,600
I always listen to the voice of the people

1110
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,950
even when I know
they are making a mistake.

1111
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:44,500
Mr. Johnson, what do you figure
we ought to do with the star?

1112
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,200
Find a cleaner vest,
to pin it on.

1113
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,500
- I don't see any spots on yours.
- Sure, pin it on Candy!

1114
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,550
-Good idea.

1115
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,100
Nice and shiny, isn't it?

1116
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,800
I've got just one official act to perform.

1117
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:59,500
Brazos, I'm serving notice on you right now

1118
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,200
that you're through
running wild in Yellow Creek.

1119
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,500
I see your lips moving, but I
haven't heard a word you said.

1120
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,650
- I can talk louder.
-Not loud enough.

1121
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,150
Keep that until you find
the right man to wear it.

1122
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,350
And there's only one way to find him.
And that's by a fair and square election.

1123
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,550
Mr Johnson, you've got some good ideas.

1124
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,850
It's about  time this town
got some self respect.

1125
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:22,200
Sure. run it like a town:
town hall, mayor and everything.

1126
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,550
Come on!

1127
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,200
Citizens need a new library.

1128
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,450
Start bringing/// tomorrow, Joe.

1129
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,200
And I suppose raise
the taxes again the day after.

1130
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,150
I'm not telling you
what to do, Mayor,

1131
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,800
as long as my cut is big enough.

1132
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,150
- How much do you want for this one?

1133
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,650
Price-tag is in all of them.

1134
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,720
- Who is it?
- Kendall.

1135
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,300
Hi, fellows.

1136
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,550
Hello, Mr. District Attorney.
You're late.

1137
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,900
Hey, Sniper, how about them ear-bobs?

1138
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:27,200
Is that what's in that case there?

1139
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,550
Brazos, we've got every roulette
we have in town

1140
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:32,950
on a 15% basis, is that right?
- That's right.

1141
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:36,350
Heist to the 20.
I don't like these, no flash.

1142
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,000
And what do we get put of this heist?

1143
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,550
Your regular cut, and that's three
times that you made in your old days.

1144
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,250
Still only knee-high
to what you're making.

1145
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,990
You like this town, don't you, Brazos?

1146
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,850
- Staying around, ain't I?
- I let you stay.

1147
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,760
Don't make me change my mind about it.

1148
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,750
Say, Candy, I got some bees today.

1149
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,450
Those stock-keepers in 200 blocks

1150
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:01,600
they can't pay the rent we want
and stay in business.

1151
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,950
Sure they can. Ask Brazos.
He's the landlord.

1152
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,850
All they got to do is
raise the price of the beans.

1153
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,150
I'll take this.
This is the biggest one they've got.

1154
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,050
All right, boys. Next board
meeting on Tuesday.

1155
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:16,000
And go out careful. We
don't need to advertise.

1156
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,250
Tell them to make these
in red, white and blue...

1157
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,300
4th July is coming.

1158
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,150
Candy, you'd better ease up on the citizens,

1159
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,850
or they'll be throwing stones
in your windows.

1160
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,900
In whose window? I don't know
there were people who are sore at me.

1161
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,250
That's why I hired them.
For them do the talking.

1162
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,950
Maybe they can't talk fast enough.

1163
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,200
We'll shift them for
another kind of gents who can.

1164
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,900
Candy, the Judge is going to spoil
your whole setup in this town.

1165
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,800
He's talking.

1166
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,500
Nobody listens to the old drunk.

1167
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,150
You know different.
If it was anybody else
you'd shut him up.

1168
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,550
I'll have a little chat with him.

1169
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,850
You'd better do it pretty quick.
He keeps talking and talking.

1170
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,900
He's out  to get you.
What's eating him, anyway?

1171
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,600
- You're his son-in-law.

1172
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,600
That's what he got against me.

1173
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:05,500
-How are you coming, honey?
-Fine, darling.

1174
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,050
I'm almost finished dressing.

1175
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:11,350
Black lace stockings
diamonds in your hair-

1176
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:13,980
that's what I promised you
and that's what you got.

1177
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:15,550
-Everything but the plumes.

1178
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,550
- Let's have a look at you.

1179
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,850
Some upset! You'll knock
the governor out tonight.

1180
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,650
But Candy, this isn't my dress.

1181
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,450
You mean to say you're gonna
cover all that up?

1182
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:31,700
Partly, anyway.
With a most beautiful dress in the world.

1183
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,300
I won't  like it
half so good.

1184
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:36,800
But Candy, most husbands
would object to their wives

1185
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,700
wearing so little.

1186
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,210
But most husbands don't
have a girl like you to show off.

1187
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,150
Think of it, darling.

1188
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,500
Tonight we're entertaining
a governor, two senators

1189
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,500
and I don't know how many millionaires.

1190
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,850
- Aren't you nervous?
- Oh sure, honey, real nervous.

1191
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,300
Soothe me

1192
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,020
Oh, Candy.

1193
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,900
Coffee in the drawing room, ladies.

1194
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,850
Now, gentlemen, don't be too
long with your cigars.

1195
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,100
- I'm depending on you, Governor.
- Count on me, Mrs. Johnson.

1196
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,500
This is quite a charming house, Mrs Johnson.

1197
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,900
You certainly brought
civilization to the wilderness.

1198
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,650
By wilderness do you mean
Yellow Creek or my husband?

1199
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,400
I always wanted to know what
they drew in the drawing room.

1200
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:18,850
Pictures or girls?

1201
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:22,220
What are you smoking, Governor? Have a cigar!

1202
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:23,450
- Thank you.

1203
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,750
Candy, tell me, are you going
to let us in

1204
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,100
on the Windfall mining stock beer?

1205
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,200
Good evening, gentlemen.

1206
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:35,150
I'm sorry, I'm a little
late to dinner, Candy...

1207
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:38,550
but I see I'm just in time
to have a drink...

1208
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:40,150
with your gang.

1209
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:44,150
- Judge Cotton, I don't believe
you've met Governor Wilson.

1210
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,750
- How do you do, sir?
-Judge Cotton. Retired.

1211
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,500
Yes, I may be a retired judge

1212
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,350
but I'm a practicing drunkard.

1213
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:57,450
Well, Judge, since we are drinking,

1214
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:00,000
I would like to propose a toast
to your son-in-law.

1215
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:03,600
Candy Johnson, Nevada's coming man of the hour.

1216
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:07,250
I can toast any man
with his own brandy and...

1217
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,250
the older the brandy,
the better the toast.

1218
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,750
To my respected son-in-law.

1219
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,850
The man who runs Yellow Creek

1220
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,250
like a set of toy trains.

1221
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:21,050
The man who arrived
here with one shirt...

1222
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:25,100
and a million words, and now
the people have all the words...

1223
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,650
and hes got
every shirt in town.

1224
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,400
That's right, Judge.

1225
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,550
But those shirts are
getting a little small for me.

1226
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:35,150
Come on now, you can do
better than that.

1227
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:38,250
Yes, yes,  I can.

1228
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,450
- To a room full of suckers. - Suckers?

1229
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:44,700
Yes, gentlemen, don't you
know what a sucker is?

1230
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,900
A sucker is anyone who
listens to Candy Johnson.

1231
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,000
Please, papa.

1232
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,450
Well, goodnight, gentlemen.
Sleep well.

1233
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:01,150
May you dream of fat
little angels, playing on harps...

1234
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,700
that look like dollar signs.

1235
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,360
Good night, Judge, and thank you.

1236
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,250
Gentlemen, the Judge just saved me
a lot of time...

1237
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:15,950
that's why I let him rip.

1238
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:19,750
He dragged something out of
the table, we all ought to see.

1239
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,300
Let's take a look at it.

1240
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,450
I do run this town, gents.

1241
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:24,650
You knew that when you came here,

1242
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:24,800
if you hadn't known it
you'd  stay away.
You knew that when you came here,

1243
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,550
if you hadn't known it
you'd  stay away.

1244
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,350
You are ready to pay for anything
that I can do for you

1245
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:32,150
and I could do plenty,
and you can pay plenty.

1246
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,050
So we are to get along.
Right?

1247
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:39,750
Gentlemen, as I was saying,
to Candy Johnson,

1248
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:42,300
Nevada's coming man of the hour.

1249
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,300
Make it Man of the Year, will you, governor?

1250
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,300
An hour sounds kind of temporary.

1251
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:57,950
I finally got Pap to bed.
Did he spoil anything for you?

1252
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,200
No.

1253
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,150
You're sweet not to be angry.

1254
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,200
Promise this dance to anybody?
-Well, yes, to my husband.

1255
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,700
Do you think he'll
mind if I cut him out?

1256
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:11,600
- I don't know, he's a little  jealous.
- He is a lot jealous.

1257
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,950
Whenever I get hold of you
I forget we are married.

1258
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:20,500
Candy, I don't think
you'll ever feel married.

1259
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:23,700
If you keep on looking
like you do  I won't.

1260
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,300
Hello, Jim. Are you going
to be ready with lunch?

1261
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,750
Oh yes, Ma'am, we're all ready,

1262
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,800
but I'm afraid, Mr. Johnson
is going to be late today.

1263
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,200
Oh no, Jim. Mr. Johnson is never late.

1264
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:41,200
Anybody out of town?
Hello honey.

1265
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,250
Hello, Jim.

1266
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,200
I came to a very serious
decision today.

1267
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,000
What, Candy?

1268
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,650
I'm not gonna work anymore
in the mornings .

1269
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:49,100
Miss you too much.

1270
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,950
I like to have you miss me.

1271
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,400
You know, I never can figure it out.

1272
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,850
whether you are prettier
by lamp light or by day light.

1273
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,100
Candy, did you mean what
you said last night?

1274
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:06,300
That depends on what you're remembering.

1275
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:09,400
Well, I mean about
not ever wanting to feel married.

1276
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,950
Who does?

1277
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,400
If you don't mind, I'd like to.
For special reasons.

1278
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,250
Well, go on, honey. Feel married.

1279
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,950
You're not so good at making coffee,
but I am not complaining.

1280
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,300
I'm afraid that
you're going to have

1281
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,300
to start feeling married, too.

1282
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:29,300
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah? Who's going to make me?

1283
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:32,900
A very tough customer.

1284
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,850
Your daughter or your son,
as the case may be.

1285
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,750
I saw Dr. Otis this morning.

1286
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:52,500
I'm a ring tail dagger.

1287
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,100
Then it doesn't make you
feel too married?

1288
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,900
Feel too...

1289
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,850
Look, honey, you shouldn't
be on your feet.

1290
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,300
Candy, put me down!

1291
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,400
Candy, I'm so happy.

1292
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:10,400
I was scared. I was scared to death

1293
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,750
that you'd start looking for that door. - What door?

1294
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,500
From now on, this
house hasn't got any doors.

1295
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,600
We're climbing up a chimney,
like Santa Claus.

1296
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,100
I'm moving downtown, Elisabeth.

1297
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,900
I never should've come
to this house in the first place.

1298
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,100
Come in, Judge, put down that bag.

1299
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:30,350
You'd better start acting
like a grandfather.

1300
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,110
A grandfather?

1301
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:37,650
Liz, hat does a grandfather
do first?

1302
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,650
First, he swells up like a toad

1303
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,200
and then he offers his congratulations.
-Why?

1304
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,300
- Why not?

1305
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:45,400
I've tried to believe
that I did not know

1306
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,300
what's been going on
in this town, Elisabeth.

1307
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:50,150
What buys dresses like this
and a house like this.

1308
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,600
What's making all the honest
respectable citizens

1309
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,200
of Yellow Creek talk about taking...

1310
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,300
the law in their own hands.

1311
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,200
Forget it, Judge.
They're just a lot of suckers

1312
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,350
talking to more suckers.

1313
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:00,350
Haven't you something
to say to that, Elisabeth?

1314
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,250
Papa, I don't question
Candy's methods.

1315
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:05,650
I see his results
and I like them.

1316
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,150
So we'll just stop talking
about that, eh, Judge?

1317
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,600
You're gonna change him, you said.

1318
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,000
You haven't changed him,
he's changed you.

1319
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:19,150
Wait a minute, Judge.
You sound like
you don't like the change.

1320
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,400
What's wrong with her
wearing dresses like this?

1321
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,850
What's wrong with
living in a house like this?

1322
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,000
What's wrong with her
being happy with me?

1323
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:27,850
If you cared about anything
but yourself, you'd know.

1324
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,600
You'd know that her only chance
is to get away from you.

1325
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,050
Anything I like, I don't let
get away from me.

1326
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:39,400
I tried to kill you once.
I should have done it.

1327
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:42,930
Papa!

1328
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:50,000
He'll come back. Honey,
what do we call him?

1329
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,700
-Who?
-The new Johnson.

1330
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:58,150
Well, what do you think of
Jederiah for a name?

1331
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,750
It wouldn't  be polite
to tell a lady.

1332
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:02,850
What say we call him
after the Judge, eh?

1333
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,750
All right.

1334
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:11,200
- Good evening.
- Where's your boss?

1335
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,250
Mr. Johnson is dressing for dinner.

1336
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,100
Tell him to slip on
a kimono and come down.

1337
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,100
Will you wait in the drawing room, gents.

1338
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,990
It's all like you said, Brazos.

1339
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,050
Candy picked the right end
of this business for himself.

1340
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,600
- A nice soft end.
- Sure he did.

1341
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,050
You boys have a lot on your side.

1342
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,500
Hello, Candy.

1343
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,550
What we had think divided up so
that we get all our business

1344
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:39,750
downtown, gents?

1345
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:41,600
This is so ripe
it won't keep.

1346
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,900
Oh, well, then sit down
and unload it.

1347
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,750
I wouldn't want you boys to carry
anything around that will spoil on you.

1348
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,950
We hear the Judge
got an awful belly ache

1349
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,600
last night
right in front of the governor.

1350
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,850
And the boys here feel we ought to
put him out of his misery.

1351
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,850
The boys are kind of taking
the bit in their teeth,

1352
01:21:58,850 --> 01:21:59,850
aren't they, Brazos?

1353
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,400
Listen, we got to do
something about the Judge.

1354
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,800
We gotta keep him from going
to that big meeting at the old mission

1355
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:05,950
tomorrow afternoon.

1356
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:07,950
There's even talk
of having a grand jury.

1357
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,800
The Judge will be there,
make quite a speech

1358
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:10,900
at Wells grocery store.

1359
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:12,900
He'll give them
some names, and facts and figures.

1360
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:16,050
And the boys don't like
to be talked about
behind their back, Candy.

1361
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:20,200
I'll send him out of town in the morning.

1362
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,600
He'll be on the one o'clock train.

1363
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:25,100
He's been put on trains before,
but he always had a round trip ticket.

1364
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,100
But not this time.

1365
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:29,300
This time, I know, Candy will send him
so far, he'll get lost.

1366
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,400
He won't get lost,
if he stays away.

1367
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,300
Only if he comes back.

1368
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:36,050
I tried to talk them out of it
till I was blue in the face.

1369
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:37,050
But that's how they feel.

1370
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,850
Must have been a becoming color.
Too bad I couldn't have seen you.

1371
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:46,250
Brazos. We don't want the boys
to go away all mixed up, do we?

1372
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,200
We don't want them to
get the idea

1373
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,050
that anything they said
is responsible for the Judge leaving.

1374
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:53,800
I'm sending him, not the boys.

1375
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:56,150
And I didn't need them
to remind me.

1376
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:58,500
Do you think we've got
that  straight, Brazos?

1377
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,850
Oh sure, boss.
Straight as a string.

1378
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,850
The only thing the boys
were worried about was

1379
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,200
you might be a little sentimental
about your family.

1380
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,540
Me, I wasn't worried at all.

1381
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,600
What lie are you gonna
tell Elisabeth?

1382
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:15,300
I'll tell her that you got the edge
to move again.

1383
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,650
When you get settled
in Chicago, drop her a line.

1384
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,000
And if you need money,
let me know.

1385
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:23,560
- Where will you be?
- Right here in Yellow Creek.

1386
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:25,830
Hanging from what tree?

1387
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,500
Listen, Judge, why don't you stop
trying to save people

1388
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:30,250
who don't need to be saved?

1389
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,250
So long!

1390
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,550
I'll have Elisabeth take
the kid back for a visit.

1391
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:45,800
Judge, you're stopping the train.

1392
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,800
I know, I'm going back, Fred.

1393
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,000
I've got to see the town
about that dog.

1394
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:52,450
I'm in favor of
hanging a rope right now.

1395
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,000
- Let's wring their necks.
- That never settled anything.

1396
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,100
We've got the Judge on our side,

1397
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,450
and he's got the lowdown
on everything they've done.

1398
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:01,200
I can't figure out
why he did it.

1399
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,800
But it has got ....
facts, figures and dates.

1400
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:05,850
We won't get
any justice in this town.

1401
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:07,350
Then we'll go to the governor.

1402
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:10,250
- I ain't so sure of him.
- Then we'll go higher up.

1403
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,800
And we'll keep on going
until somebody listens to us.

1404
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:16,300
Everybody in Yellow Creek got a right
to speak his own piece.

1405
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,650
Glad you feel that way
about it, honey.

1406
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,650
As I'm ready to speak mine.

1407
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:24,050
We'd sooner listen to the Judge.

1408
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,750
Your guest of honor
sends his regrets, folks,

1409
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,450
and asks that I take over.

1410
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,850
I understand that you people
feel there's a squawk coming.

1411
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,450
-Yeah! - A large one..

1412
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:35,250
When the Judge gets through talking

1413
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,000
the grand jury will  hear the mile away.

1414
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,850
You don't seem to get the point, Mr Wells.

1415
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:41,300
The Judge is through talking,
but I am not.

1416
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,300
I don't like
to blow my horn, folks,

1417
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,750
But seems to me as though
I have to remind you
of a few things.

1418
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,950
Haven't you forgotten that
I built the first thing

1419
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:51,550
that looked like a church
in this town?

1420
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,850
I built the first school?

1421
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
The first Fire House?

1422
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,450
Don't let him
round up.

1423
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:57,600
Or he'll have us nod
like Christmas tigers.

1424
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:00,300
I can prove that out of every dollar
collected for taxes

1425
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,300
40 cents have gone
for public improvements.

1426
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,800
And we can prove
60 cents goes to you.

1427
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,850
I don't like a talk like that.

1428
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,650
I'm going to let you
try out your proof
or pull in your horns.

1429
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:14,750
Maybe I can try out that proof, Candy.

1430
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:17,050
I'm sorry, I'm late, folks.

1431
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,050
-What happened?
-Brazos killed the judge.

1432
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,650
Papa!

1433
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:58,750
Phil, call Dr. Otis.

1434
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:01,570
Come on, boy, give me a hand.
Let's take her into the house.

1435
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,050
- Where's the hot water?
- How is she?

1436
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,400
I can't say yet, Mr Johnson.
Dr. Otis will tell you himself.

1437
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,950
That charlatan is taking his time there.

1438
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,800
Don't worry, Candy man.

1439
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,700
Women don't get hurt so easy.

1440
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,450
Drop them down, and they rise up again.

1441
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,700
- This Otis, is he a good doctor?
- Sure. The best in Yellow Creek.

1442
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,100
He's the only one in Yellow Creek.
To me he's the worst, too

1443
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:38,710
Will you go inside and
help the nurse, please.

1444
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,450
Well?

1445
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:45,350
I'm sorry, sir, but your wife
isn't going to have that child.

1446
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,750
Mr. Johnson, I must tell you
I' m afraid for your wife, too.

1447
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,400
- What?
- I'll operate, but-

1448
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:17,240
Operate? What are you talking about?

1449
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:19,400
It's a long chance.
You've got to understand that.

1450
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:22,700
I'll try, but I cannot
give you much hope.

1451
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,600
Any hope, really.

1452
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,150
Don't tell me
my wife is going to die.

1453
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:33,250
I don't like talk like that.

1454
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:36,200
Take hold of yourself, man,
I'm doing my best.

1455
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,500
- But I'm only human.
- I am not.

1456
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,050
And if you don't pull her through
I'll prove it to you.

1457
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:45,650
I swear that, Otis.
By your life.

1458
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,400
I'm trying everything I know.

1459
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:51,200
You heard me.

1460
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:13,970
Well, the doctor finished, Candy, but...

1461
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:17,350
we are not going
to know anything much
for a couple of hours.

1462
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,450
She's still under the drug.

1463
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:48,600
Candy, through my fault Papa's dead.

1464
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,450
Poor papa.

1465
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:56,900
He was only trying to help me.

1466
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,750
You'd better not talk now, honey.

1467
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:07,750
Papa, he didn't understand that
I couldn't leave you.

1468
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:13,400
No matter what you do.

1469
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:30,080
I should believe you.
But I never will.

1470
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:37,500
I should not think about it.
I should not think...

1471
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:48,300
Some day, some day
I really won't care

1472
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,740
I'll be like you.

1473
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:58,010
I'll  lie, cheat,
and steal, too.

1474
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,370
The drug is still effective.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

1475
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,850
- How is she?
- We don't know yet.

1476
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,400
I got to talk to Candy.
We're heading for trouble.

1477
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:48,400
- Not now, Sniper.
- This is serious, honey.

1478
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,260
It' s a shooting problem. Candy!

1479
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,300
People are holding meetings
all over this town.

1480
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,800
Borrough and Fare Wells
to lead them.

1481
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:55,650
If they're gonna to get you
and your buds out of Yellow Creek

1482
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:56,750
they are obliged to do it.

1483
01:30:56,950 --> 01:31:00,600
Brazos and the boys grabbed the guns
made a hold-up in the city hall

1484
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:03,750
And if you don't tell them
what to do, it's gonna be Brazos.

1485
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,100
Candy, you'd better listen to him.

1486
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,950
And the Judge getting himself killed
that way,

1487
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:08,300
He toughed off the whole thing.

1488
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:10,000
He should have stayed
on that train.

1489
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,250
I'll tell you why he came back.

1490
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:16,050
He thought I wasn't
any good for Elisabeth.

1491
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:18,200
He told me her only chance
was to get away from me.

1492
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,450
He believed that.

1493
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:22,100
He believed it so much
he got himself killed for it.

1494
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,950
That's believing.

1495
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,300
Candy, you've been wearing
that carpet out for hours.

1496
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,500
Why don't you try to rest?

1497
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:49,600
Well, Mr. Johnson,
your wife is resting quietly.

1498
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,900
She's going to be all right.

1499
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:01,250
Thanks, doc.
Write your own ticket

1500
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,600
for anything you want from me.

1501
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,050
At the moment, I think I'll ask the cook
for a cup of coffee.

1502
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:15,700
Gold Dust ...

1503
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,350
This will tell Elisabeth
where everything is.

1504
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,850
Give it to her some time.

1505
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:25,100
Here's the key to the strongbox.

1506
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:27,150
Tell her there's
enough cash in it to last

1507
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:28,800
for 50 years in Yellow Creek.

1508
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:30,850
And a 100 years in Boston.

1509
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:33,550
You're taking a fine time
to walk out.

1510
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,500
I should have done that a long while back.

1511
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,900
Not unless you're no good for her
like the Judge said.

1512
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,100
I've got a different reason.

1513
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:41,700
Her speed is
some sucker working in a grocer store

1514
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,830
anything around with ten cans.
That's for her.

1515
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:45,500
I've just found it out.

1516
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,450
Your wife is asking for you,
Mr. Johnson.

1517
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,500
Tell her I've gone

1518
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,250
Never mind.

1519
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:19,330
Here, here.

1520
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:30,850
Did the doctor tell you, Candy?

1521
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:35,540
Sure, honey, he said
you're going to be fine.

1522
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,000
I lost your baby.

1523
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:48,750
But you didn't get lost yourself.
That's what counts.

1524
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,900
At first I didn't think
you wanted that baby, Candy.

1525
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,170
Then you was so happy.

1526
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:05,600
- We'll have another one.

1527
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,000
You're going to have
everything you want to have.

1528
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:11,500
A nice clean world,
all dressed up in a white shirt

1529
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,500
with its face washed.

1530
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,750
I like the one I have.

1531
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,850
- No, you just  got kind of used to it.

1532
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:22,850
- I couldn't live without it.

1533
01:34:25,650 --> 01:34:27,550
You  better get some sleep now.

1534
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:32,950
I want to stay awake and
think about my husband.

1535
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:35,950
The doc says you've got
to have some to rest.

1536
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:42,820
Then I could sleep
and dream about him.

1537
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,400
How about a kiss?

1538
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,200
Could you make it a little bigger?

1539
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:57,150
This will have to do me a long time.

1540
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,600
For any time away from you
is a long time.

1541
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,000
That's just came.

1542
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Got another message from Sniper.

1543
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:31,650
People are putting up barricades
outside city hall.

1544
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:33,950
They are getting early
to blow the place apart.

1545
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:39,050
My pal, the governor,
wants to know do I need

1546
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:41,200
militia, to put the citizens
back in their suckers.

1547
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:42,150
- And do you?

1548
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:44,100
- I take it, we've got
enough killing already

1549
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:45,850
if I still got my voice.

1550
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,800
And just to make sure
that I get a chance

1551
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,800
to use it
I'll take this along.

1552
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,650
Good bye, Gold Dust.
Don't take any wooden suckers.

1553
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:02,700
So long... Big Stinky.

1554
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:11,000
All right, stand by, everybody.
We're gonna start this little fracas.

1555
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:14,250
- You women keep in the background.
- Women shouldn't be here anyway.

1556
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:17,050
It can't keep them out.
Dan, we're all ready.

1557
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:18,250
Let's unravel some cartridges.

1558
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,850
Take it easy,don't rush it out.

1559
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,850
Give them a chance to get out and surrender.

1560
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:24,400
Hey you inside there!

1561
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,900
The city hall belongs to this town.

1562
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:30,550
Get out of there, or
we'll start shooting.

1563
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:33,300
You better not try it.
We've got the law on our side.

1564
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:35,840
Come on, boys, watch those windows.

1565
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:38,350
That's Candy Johnson.
What's he doing here?

1566
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:39,550
What do you want?

1567
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:41,250
- Where do you think
you're going?

1568
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,550
- You do not think I belong here, do you?"

1569
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:45,550
No, I don't. Go in there
with your friends.

1570
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:48,200
You and the rest of you got
5 minutes to get out of town.

1571
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,500
If you go with your hands up
and your pockets empty.

1572
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:52,750
But we want Brazos
for killing the Judge.

1573
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,600
You are bucking duly elected officers
of the town government.

1574
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,700
We're just voting you all out.
The fast way.

1575
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,600
The governor does not like it that way.

1576
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:03,250
He sent me a telegram, he wants to know
if I need the militia...

1577
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:04,750
to teach you folks some manners.

1578
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:07,500
No use talking, Candy.
We won't hear you last today.

1579
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:09,700
We are in our right,
that's why we gonna lick you

1580
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:11,250
and no one's gonna stop us.

1581
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,400
The bigger the herd,
the easier the stampede.

1582
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:17,450
One side, suckers.

1583
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,900
Next time you talk
to "suckers",  say 'please'.

1584
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,200
Get them up.

1585
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,550
Candy, these folks came in
with the support of Brazos.

1586
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,000
He is right.

1587
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,850
The boys think
you're a little late,

1588
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:40,150
a little too late to fit in on this game.

1589
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,600
- Still trying to play boss.
-I'm boss.

1590
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:47,050
We're changing places.

1591
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:48,750
I get that the high horse
you've been riding

1592
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,150
and you'll get a little slug of lead.

1593
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,550
But first you gonna do some crawling.

1594
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,550
Light me.

1595
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:58,400
I told you once
I don't carry matches.

1596
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:03,560
There's plenty matches.
Light.

1597
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:21,650
Better try light in Western style,
with thumb nail,

1598
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:23,900
if you can keep your fingers from shaking.

1599
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:32,300
Three tries, and you're out, Candy man.

1600
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,150
This time, you better try light 
on the seat of your pants,

1601
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:36,700
sucker style.

1602
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:43,140
Come on, sucker, reach for
he seat of your pants.

1603
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:57,250
Drop it, Candy.

1604
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:00,600
Your accounts with
Brazos is your business.

1605
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:01,800
What will happen
to us is up to us.

1606
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,000
If we don't give in to the town, 
the town will get us.

1607
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,500
We've got the law on our side,
but there's a mob out there.

1608
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,550
They're gonna shoot us.

1609
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:11,000
You heard the boys.
Where do you stand?

1610
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:13,850
Wait a minute, you've just seen
a little family feud.

1611
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:16,050
After what happened to the Judge
you can understand that.

1612
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:18,950
But you, boys?
That's different.

1613
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:21,150
Who put you in office?
Who gave you your jobs?

1614
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:22,950
Where do you think I stand?

1615
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,100
There was a time when I wouldn't
have agreed with you.

1616
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:26,800
I'd have gone out
trying to talk those rabbits

1617
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,450
back into the grounds
and started running.

1618
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:30,600
But I'm still talking to the suckers.
And I'm through running.

1619
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:33,550
Hot lead - that's the only answer
to any questions they can ask.

1620
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:34,700
Just as it is spoken.

1621
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:35,950
We'll show them 
the holes of our  guns

1622
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:36,950
and they will tell them what to do.

1623
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:38,850
If they don't do it
the excitement starts.

1624
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,600
When gents like us
get into anything

1625
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,350
they have to play off and
show the other side.

1626
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:43,750
as well as dough in a sack.

1627
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,450
Come on, get to those windows.

1628
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:47,050
Let's limber up your trigger fingers.

1629
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:48,800
When we polish up a town
full of citizens

1630
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,700
we'll be famous.

1631
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:51,050
This isn't a real fight.

1632
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:53,450
I can promise you some fireworks
when the militia gets here.

1633
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,100
-Militia?
-Did you say the militia will come?

1634
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:57,100
Sure, the state militia.

1635
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,800
They will come charged with cannons,

1636
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,800
and we'll have some nice shiny
bronze buttons to shoot at.

1637
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:02,850
-10 on a trooper and 16 on an officer.

1638
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:03,950
- What's the militia is coming here for?

1639
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:05,250
I thought the governor
was a friend of yours.

1640
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:07,350
Sure. He is a friend of the end.

1641
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:09,350
And the end is when we start shooting.

1642
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:10,200
He sent me a telegram.

1643
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,700
Said he was sending up this uniform
to set us back on our boozy.

1644
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:13,900
But there's a mob there.

1645
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:15,700
Why doesn't the governor
send the troops on to them?

1646
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,450
Because he's got a yellow belly.

1647
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:19,100
He knows that
once we start shooting

1648
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,550
that won't be a mob anymore.

1649
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,100
That will be a lot of dead suckers
smelling off a respectable.

1650
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:25,050
Come on, boys,
who wants the honor

1651
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:26,700
of shooting the first one on the ground?

1652
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,050
What about you, Adams? 
 Come on!

1653
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,550
We got all the money
in Yellow Creek,

1654
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:31,700
we got every public office

1655
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,000
and we got the law tied
like a rodeo stag.

1656
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:36,900
Say, when I got all that,
I hang on and reach out for more.

1657
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:39,450
Either that or stick our tails between
our legs and start running.

1658
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,400
I'm through running. I've been
run out of too many towns.

1659
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:45,840
So I got me a town of my own.
And this is it - my town.

1660
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:46,650
Your town?

1661
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:48,500
I will not fight them
to fill your pockets.

1662
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:50,850
He's right, Candy.
Those troops can massacre us.

1663
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,700
Maybe they can 
and maybe they will.

1664
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:54,650
But what a fight we'll put up
before we lose!

1665
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:56,550
We not gonna run out
the back way 

1666
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,500
just because it's not guarded.

1667
01:40:57,550 --> 01:40:58,300
Not us!

1668
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:00,450
We're gonna make it a scrap
every step of the way.

1669
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,050
until the last one of us
grabs his belly and

1670
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:03,200
and falls with his face in the dirt.

1671
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:05,100
I ain't too proud
to go the back way.

1672
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:06,950
- How about you, boys? - Me neither!

1673
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,750
Hey, wait a minute.
Come back you devils!
Adams, come here.

1674
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:12,650
You have no more 
to lose than I do

1675
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,550
except for the brains and
a couple of gallons of blood.

1676
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:16,800
Come back, you yellow snouts!

1677
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:27,900
Light me.

1678
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,600
You're getting more like Brazos
 every minute.

1679
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,600
I ought to be dead
to be like Brazos.

1680
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:36,150
You are dead in Yellow Creek.

1681
01:41:36,150 --> 01:41:37,950
You've just given the town
back to those suckers.

1682
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,400
You are crazy. My brave army
just ran out on me.

1683
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,100
Ran like dogs on fire.

1684
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:43,800
You mean you ran them out yourself?

1685
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,200
Candy, that was the best
con speech I've ever heard in my life.

1686
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,600
- What do you mean: con speech?
I just only tried to get them interested.

1687
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:53,850
All right, move in, it's vacant.

1688
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,750
Vacant?  What about 
that gang of cut-throats?

1689
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:59,350
Here they come.
Looks like old times.

1690
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:01,400
-Where are they?
- Where's the rest of that gang?

1691
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,750
- They went out the back way.
That's right, Dan, they're gone.

1692
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:06,350
-What about Brazos?
- He's got a hole drilled in him.

1693
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,050
They can hang him up on a nail.

1694
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,300
One side, suckers.

1695
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:13,300
Please.

1696
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,200
I hope this train is
headed for Cheyenne.

1697
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,500
- What about our laundry?
- Forget it

1698
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,150
It's a little frayed
around the edges, anyway.

1699
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:30,400
- I'm kind of sorry to see him go.
-Why?

1700
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,450
Never mind, I wouldn't know
what I mean anyhow.

1701
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:36,050
- Why? 
- Because you ain't a female!

1702
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,800
What's that you're playing, boys?
Poker?

1703
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:48,250
Why don't you sit down 
and find out?

1704
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,150
Thanks.
I don't mind if I do.

1705
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:56,550
Pardon me.

1706
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,200
Sniper!

1707
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,650
I could not be more gladder to see you

1708
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:05,650
as if you are the fat sucker
 from Iowa.

1709
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:09,900
Sniper, I've never told you this,
but you're a beautiful man.

1710
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:11,950
Candy's up upstairs.
Room 206.

1711
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:13,900
The first turn on the left.
At the head  of the stairs.

1712
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:16,850
You're smart and I like
you taste in postcards, too.

1713
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:20,300
- Where are you going?
- Room 206.

1714
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,900
The first turn on the left.

1715
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:28,610
And Mrs.

1716
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,950
Come in!

1717
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,200
It's bad luck to say goodbye
twice to the same person.

1718
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:57,500
So don't say it.

1719
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:59,550
You said it once and
you didn't mean it.

1720
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,000
You're a liar, Mr. Johnson.

1721
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:06,000
I don't want any more talk.
I don't know what you mean

1722
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,250
when you say you came here
because I've  changed.

1723
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,750
- Yes, Candy. - I haven't changed.

1724
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:11,800
And you're here
because you're crazy about me.

1725
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:12,800
Yes, Candy.

1726
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:15,500
You like me the way I was
and the way I always will be.

1727
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:17,400
You wouldn't change
a hair of my head.

1728
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:18,900
No, Candy man.

1729
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:23,100
Now for understanding it
so well, what do I get?

1729
01:44:24,305 --> 01:45:24,674
