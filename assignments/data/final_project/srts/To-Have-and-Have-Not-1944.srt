1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:36,119
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Capt. Morgan.

3
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,098
- What can I do for you today?
- Same thing as yesterday.

4
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:42,301
You and your client wish to make
a temporary exit from the port?

5
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:43,903
That is right.

6
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,552
- Name?
- Harry Morgan.

7
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,915
- Nationality?
- Eskimo.

8
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,990
- What?
- American.

9
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:59,084
- Name of ship?
- Queen Conch, Key West, Florida.

10
00:01:59,184 --> 00:02:02,321
We're going fishing, like we've done
every day for over two weeks.

11
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:06,525
We'll be back tonight, and I don't think
we'll go more than 30 miles offshore.

12
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,104
Five francs, please.

13
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:10,262
One more thing.

14
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:13,799
You will go nowhere near the vicinity
of territorial waters...

15
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,970
Sainte-Lucie, or Dominique.

16
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:17,937
- Is that a new order?
- Yes.

17
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,740
The decree was issued last night
by his Excellency, Admiral Robert...

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,343
Governor General
of the French West Indies.

19
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,145
Good for him.

20
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,282
- Why, any complaints?
- No.

21
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,673
Hello, Harry. How's everything?

22
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,574
That feels good.

23
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,909
- Did you bring me a drink?
- Horatio's bringing it.

24
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,218
You're my pal, Harry.
We sure got them this morning.

25
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,216
- We got them every morning.
- Not last Thursday.

26
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:40,263
That's right, I forgot.
You're right, Eddie.

27
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,688
Here's Horatio. Give him a hand, will you?

28
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:45,224
- Good morning, mon Capitaine.
- Good morning.

29
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:48,430
- Did you get the bait?
- Yes, sir. Plenty of it.

30
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:56,201
- That guard took a bottle of our beer.
- Mr. Johnson can afford it.

31
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:58,440
- Harry, can I have....
- Just one.

32
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,908
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.

33
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,377
- Are we going out?
- That's up to you.

34
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:07,312
What sort of a day will it be?

35
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:10,349
I don't know.
Just about like yesterday. Only better.

36
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,089
- Let's go out, then.
- Okay. Hop aboard.

37
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:16,799
- Stand by to cast off.
- All right, mon Capitaine.

38
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,092
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yeah?

39
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,294
- I got to get some gas.
- All right.

40
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,203
I'll need money for that.

41
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,071
How much?

42
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,834
28 cents a gallon. 40 gallons.

43
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,107
That'll be $11 .20.

44
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:32,438
There's $15.

45
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,241
- I'll get you some change at the gas dock.
- Put it against what I owe you.

46
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,752
Let her go.

47
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,532
Watch it, Johnson.

48
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,738
There's your strike.

49
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,702
Put on a little more drag. Not too much.

50
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,638
You'll have to sock him.
He's gonna jump, anyway.

51
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:43,015
Hit him again. Hit him three or four times.
Stick it into him.

52
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,952
Better get the other teaser in.

53
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,287
I got him!

54
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,264
Ease up on that drag.

55
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:58,524
He's gone.

56
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,764
He's not. Ease up on that drag. Quick.

57
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,977
If he wants to go, let him go.

58
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,475
- He's gone.
- No, he's hooked good.

59
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,577
- He sure is.
- Reel him in.

60
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,220
No. I'm sure he's gone.

61
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:25,323
I'll tell you when he's gone.
Reel in fast.

62
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,026
- He's gone now.
- Yes, sir, he's gone now.

63
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:37,262
- He isn't. Turn around and chase him.
- Reel in that line.

64
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:40,232
- I can still feel him pull.
- That's the weight of the line.

65
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,735
- You're crazy. I can hardly reel it in.
- Maybe he's dead.

66
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:46,577
Maybe. But he's still jumping out there.

67
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,618
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying, Mr. Johnson.

68
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:02,321
- Can't you put bait on like that, Captain?
- Sure I can.

69
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,624
- Why carry this fellow to do it?
- When the big fish run, you'll see.

70
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,025
What's the idea?

71
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,861
He can do it faster than I can.

72
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,101
A dollar a day
seems like an unnecessary expense to me.

73
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,033
He's necessary. Aren't you, Horatio?

74
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,476
I hope so.

75
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,775
Can't Eddie do it?

76
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:20,906
No, he can't.

77
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,207
What's the matter?

78
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,082
He just lost a fish.

79
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,084
Mr. Johnson, you're unlucky.

80
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:29,982
Would it be all right if I...

81
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,756
- In the icebox. Just take one.
- Thanks.

82
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,857
I don't see why
you want that rummy around.

83
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,058
Eddie was a good man on a boat
before he got to be a rummy.

84
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,326
He's no good now.

85
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,303
Start her going ahead.

86
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:45,697
- Is he related to you or something?
- No.

87
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:49,438
- What do you look after him for?
- He thinks he's looking after me.

88
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:52,446
All right, let her run.

89
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,224
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yeah?

90
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,154
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

91
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:12,291
Look, it might interest you to know
I not only bought the beer...

92
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,694
- but I put a deposit on the bottles.
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

93
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,496
- A dead what?
- A dead honeybee.

94
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,731
I was never bit by any kind of a bee.

95
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,800
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

96
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,609
In that case, I'll just finish my nap.
Thanks for the beer.

97
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,075
Watch that line.

98
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,620
That's enough for one day.

99
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:45,557
- What happened?
- Nothing. You just lost a rod and reel.

100
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:49,127
You had the drag screwed tight.
When the fish struck, you couldn't hold it.

101
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,530
If you had the harness
buckled down to the reel...

102
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,899
that fish would have taken you
along with him.

103
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,302
You're just unlucky, Mr. Johnson.
Now, maybe you're lucky with women.

104
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:01,239
- What do you say if we go out tonight?
- I'll lucky you, you dirty rummy.

105
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,875
- Are you a good swimmer?
- I've taken all I'm gonna take.

106
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:06,278
Me, too. Be careful
you don't slip out of my hands.

107
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:09,018
Take it easy.
This guy owes you for 16 days.

108
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,655
Fifteen.

109
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,760
You talk too much, Eddie.

110
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,498
I know it, Harry.

111
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,001
Okay, forget it.

112
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,121
What about tomorrow?

113
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,990
I don't think so.
I'm fed up with this kind of fishing.

114
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,726
I can see how you would be.
Slack that off a little.

115
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:57,963
You fish for 16 days,
hook a couple of fish any good fisherman...

116
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:00,165
would give his life to tie into,
and lose both.

117
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:03,368
- You're just unlucky. I never seen no one...
- Shut up, Eddie.

118
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,637
You said 16 days. I only owe you for 15.

119
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:08,407
No. With today it's 16.
Then there's the rod and reel.

120
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,276
- The tackle's your risk.
- Not when you lose it like you did.

121
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:13,545
I paid to rent it every day.
It's your risk.

122
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,481
If you ran a hired car over a cliff,
you'd have to pay for it.

123
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:19,985
- Not if he was in it. That's a good one.
- That's good, Eddie.

124
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,220
You lost the outfit through carelessness.

125
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,822
It cost me $275.

126
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:28,060
I won't charge you for the line, 'cause
a fish so big could've taken it all anyway.

127
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,700
And there's 16 days at $35 a day,
that's $560.

128
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,874
No, it's $560, Eddie.

129
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,036
You got a little credit,
so that'll be $825 altogether.

130
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,844
That's what you owe me,
and that's what I want.

131
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,910
I haven't got that much with me.
I'll go to the bank in the morning.

132
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,512
- That'll be all right?
- I guess it'll have to be.

133
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,448
- Let's go have a drink.
- Good idea...

134
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,550
- Stay here and lock up.
- Sure you don't...

135
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,856
No, Eddie.

136
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:59,224
Look there. I thought everybody
took their flag in after 6:00.

137
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,860
- Most of them do.
- That's Vichy for you.

138
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,633
It's their flag.

139
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,198
See you later.

140
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,747
Gentlemen, may I have your names?

141
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,049
What for?

142
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,152
I heard this gentleman
make a disparaging reference to Vichy.

143
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,554
I never said anything about Vichy, did I?

144
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:31,723
I don't know,
I wasn't paying much attention.

145
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:33,925
- Your names, please.
- Look, we're Americans....

146
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:37,529
His name's Johnson. My name's Morgan.
We're living at the Marquis Hotel.

147
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,040
That do you?

148
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:51,212
Yes, sir?

149
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:53,011
- What's yours?
- Bourbon.

150
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,852
Bourbon. And a rum for me.

151
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:57,883
- Gentlemen, what luck today?
- Not so good, Frenchy.

152
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:01,820
- We lost the biggest fish I ever saw.
- Maybe tomorrow you hook him again.

153
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,722
Not me. I'm through. This is my last day.

154
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:05,690
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

155
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,235
Here's to you.

156
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:13,031
I'm gonna clean up.

157
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,734
- That was $800 and....
- $25.

158
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,404
$825.

159
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,638
- Johnson.
- Yeah?

160
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,373
What time tomorrow morning?

161
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:24,342
After I get to the bank.
Say around 10:30 or 11:00?

162
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,422
I'll be waiting for you.

163
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:31,325
- Any trouble, Harry?
- No, Frenchy.

164
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:34,327
- Then you are free after today?
- Yeah. Why?

165
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:38,495
There were some people in here today.
They wanted to hire your boat.

166
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,228
- Fishermen?
- No. Some friends of friends of mine.

167
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,604
Not a chance.

168
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,470
- The key, monsieur.
- Thank you.

169
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,372
Please listen to me, Harry.

170
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:56,875
They only want to use your boat
for one night.

171
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,577
- They'll pay you well.
- For what?

172
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,380
I'd like to oblige, but I can't afford
to get mixed up in local politics.

173
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,983
I would not speak if it weren't important.

174
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:09,026
Please, can I go with you to your room?

175
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,827
Sure. Come ahead.

176
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:35,721
Anybody got a match?

177
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:58,809
Thanks.

178
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:03,642
Who's that?

179
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:07,155
She came in this afternoon.
The plane from the south.

180
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:12,091
Now look, Frenchy, about that other thing.

181
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:17,022
I know where you stand
and what your sympathies are.

182
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,758
It's all right for you,
but I don't want any part of it.

183
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,694
If I'm caught fooling with you fellas,
my goose'll be cooked.

184
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,263
Probably lose my boat, too.
I ain't that interested.

185
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:27,465
But they are coming to see you tonight.

186
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:30,637
You better get word to them.
They'll just be wasting their time.

187
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,874
Sorry. I'll see you later.

188
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,916
Take over.

189
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,816
Bravo!

190
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:37,862
I tried to reach those fellows,
but I can't get in contact with them.

191
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,764
Who? The ones who wanted to hire my boat?

192
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:43,468
It's dangerous enough for them
to come at all, but to come for nothing...

193
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:46,845
I didn't ask to see them.
You better head them off.

194
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,108
- Hello.
- Let's have it.

195
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,844
- What do you want?
- Johnson's wallet.

196
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,946
- What?
- Come on.

197
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,352
What are you talking about?

198
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:32,787
Mister, what's got into you?

199
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,873
What do you think you're gonna do?

200
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,609
I'm gonna get that wallet, Slim.

201
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,670
I'd rather you wouldn't call me Slim.

202
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,273
I'm a little too skinny to take it kindly.

203
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,715
Quit the baby talk.

204
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,056
Which is it?

205
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:04,755
You know, Steve,
I wouldn't put it past you.

206
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:09,354
I didn't know you were a hotel detective.

207
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,530
Johnson's my client.

208
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:15,168
He doesn't speak so well of you.

209
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:16,896
He's still my client.

210
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:20,698
Pick on somebody to steal from
that doesn't owe me money.

211
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,201
He dropped it and I picked it up.

212
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:25,637
You were gonna give it back to him,
of course?

213
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,683
No, I wasn't.

214
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,142
- I don't like him.
- That's a pretty good reason.

215
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:33,878
Besides, I need boat fare
to get out of Martinique.

216
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,079
Another good reason...

217
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:38,160
but you'll have to get it
from somebody else.

218
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,022
- How do you like that?
- Find anything?

219
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:46,397
About $60 in cash
and about $1,400 in travelers checks.

220
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,359
Do you expect more?

221
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,769
That bird owed me $825.

222
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:53,097
"I haven't got that much on me," he says.

223
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:56,467
"I'll have to go to the bank
and pay you off tomorrow," he says.

224
00:18:56,567 --> 00:19:00,805
And all the time he's got a reservation
on a plane leaving tomorrow at daylight.

225
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:03,112
So he was gonna skip out on you.

226
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,785
Your client.

227
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:08,346
- Good thing you didn't give it back to him.
- Then I did you a favor.

228
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,882
That's right.
But if I hadn't stopped you...

229
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,151
you'd have gotten away
with the whole works.

230
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:15,891
After all, I am entitled to something.

231
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,423
Don't you think so, Slim?

232
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,468
What do you think is fair?

233
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,002
I'll leave that to you.

234
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:29,111
What would you say to....

235
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,977
Please, Harry.
I told them, but they insisted...

236
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,979
It is not Gerard's fault, Mr. Morgan.

237
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,184
Come in and close the door.

238
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,684
You know,
I told Frenchy I wasn't interested.

239
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:48,991
I know. But close the door, please.

240
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,392
I'm very sorry to intrude this way...

241
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,530
- but this is of great importance and we...
- One moment.

242
00:19:58,429 --> 00:19:59,965
I'd better go.

243
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,670
- See you later.
- Stick around. We're not through yet.

244
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,172
It's all right to talk
in front of her, isn't it?

245
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,907
- Go ahead.
- But it's no good.

246
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,409
- If you'd listen...
- No use.

247
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:14,212
- You're taking a chance coming here.
- We're not afraid.

248
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,981
I am. I'm sorry, I can't and won't do it.

249
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:18,816
We'll give you 2,500 francs.

250
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,586
- That's only $50 in American money.
- It is more to us.

251
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:25,456
It is only a little voyage
to a place about 40 kilometers from here.

252
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:28,259
- We'd give you more money, but we can't.
- It's all we have.

253
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,862
Don't make me feel bad.
I tell you true, I can't do it.

254
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:34,298
Afterwards, when things are changed,
it would mean a good deal to you.

255
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:35,433
Yes, I know.

256
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:39,070
Mr. Morgan, I thought all Americans
were friendly to our side.

257
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,874
They are. But there's a rumor
that they put fellas on Devil's Island...

258
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:45,743
for doing what you're doing.
I'm not that friendly to anybody.

259
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,945
But they wouldn't do that to an American.

260
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:50,025
Do you really think that?

261
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:53,020
- Who's that?
- It's me, Harry.

262
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,421
It's all right.

263
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,624
- Hi, Harry? How you been keeping?
- Hello, Eddie.

264
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:02,093
- I wanted to talk to you about...
- Could we continue...

265
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:04,996
Who are you? Who are these guys, Harry?

266
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,497
Eddie's a friend of mine.

267
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:08,599
He was hanging around the dock
after you left.

268
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,702
You have a good memory for one who drinks.

269
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,705
Drinking don't bother my memory.
If it did I wouldn't drink.

270
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,540
I couldn't. You see...

271
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,484
I'd forget how good it was.
Then where would I be?

272
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:22,280
- I'd start drinking water again.
- Maybe you'd forget about water, too.

273
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,724
No, I wouldn't. I see too much of it.

274
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:30,399
Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

275
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:33,999
I've no memory of ever being bit
by any kind of bee.

276
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:36,133
Were you?

277
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,263
You're all right.
You and Harry's the only ones that...

278
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,133
- Don't forget Frenchy.
- Right. You, Harry and Frenchy.

279
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:45,269
You got to be careful of dead bees
if you go around barefooted.

280
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,773
If you step on them, they can sting
just as bad as if they was alive.

281
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:52,116
Especially if they was kind of mad
when they got killed.

282
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:56,916
- I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.
- You have? Why don't you bite them back?

283
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:00,456
That's what Harry always says.

284
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,690
But I ain't got no stinger.

285
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,361
- Does he always talk so much?
- Always.

286
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:10,230
- What do you want to see me about?
- Oh, yeah, Harry....

287
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:14,398
I guess I forgot.

288
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:18,071
That's all right. I'll see you
down at the dock later tonight.

289
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,238
Say, Harry, could you....

290
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,185
Thanks. You're all right. So long.

291
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,646
Sorry. We could stay at this all night
and the answer would still be the same.

292
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:32,183
I don't care who runs France
or Martinique, or who wants to run it.

293
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:34,388
You'll have to get somebody else.

294
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,722
Come on, Slim.
We still got some unfinished business.

295
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:38,823
Good night.

296
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:42,530
Make yourselves at home, boys.
Cigarettes are on the table over there.

297
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:50,501
I want to see Johnson's face
when you give it back to him.

298
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,944
All right.

299
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:14,392
Where've you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

300
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:16,561
You're a fine one,
running off with my girl.

301
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,630
She's got something
she wants to give you. Go ahead, Slim.

302
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,471
Here's your wallet.

303
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:26,204
- How did you get it?
- I stole it.

304
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:30,308
That's a fine thing.
What are you gonna do about it?

305
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,685
The question is,
what are you going to do about it?

306
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:36,347
You'd better look it over
and see if it's all there.

307
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:37,915
It's all right, I'm sure.

308
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:41,292
No, you check it over.
She might want a receipt for it.

309
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,690
- It's all right. There's nothing missing.
- You sure?

310
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,291
Yeah. Now, young lady, I...

311
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:50,133
You better count those travelers checks.

312
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:54,833
- I know. There's $1,400.
- But you had to go to the bank tomorrow.

313
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:58,069
What's the time on that plane ticket
you got there?

314
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,273
6:30.

315
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:02,311
In the morning.
And the bank opens at 10:00.

316
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:13,117
- I don't like him any better than you do.
- I was going to...

317
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:16,621
You were going to sign some
of those traveler's checks, weren't you?

318
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,860
- Yeah. Sure.
- Emil, you got a pen handy?

319
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:35,579
- $825.
- Yeah.

320
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:39,087
Stay where you are!

321
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:53,966
- Stay where you are.
- I think I'm sitting on someone's cigarette.

322
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:25,656
- This is awful.
- Did they get them all?

323
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:28,862
One got away, at least.
I think it was Beauclere.

324
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,628
Look, Harry, this is bad.

325
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,997
But no one but me knows
that you two saw them.

326
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:34,999
And Eddie, but he won't remember.

327
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:39,236
When the police come, you know nothing.
Do you realize, mademoiselle?

328
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:41,282
Don't be a fool. Stay inside.

329
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:58,690
Monsieur Gerard!

330
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,610
Cut it out, Cricket.

331
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:23,614
He couldn't write any faster
than he could duck.

332
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:26,695
Another minute
and these checks would have been good.

333
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:40,900
Stay right where you are and keep quiet!
Stay right where you are.

334
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,977
- Who's that?
- Sûreté Nationale.

335
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:51,786
Gestapo?

336
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:54,723
Lot of them, isn't there?

337
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:12,963
- What happened to this man?
- A stray bullet.

338
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,965
His name is Johnson, an American.

339
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:17,909
- Unfortunate. Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

340
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:24,084
Call attention.

341
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,210
Your attention, everyone.

342
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:31,593
All this is regrettable,
but there is no cause for alarm.

343
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:35,352
We are only interested in those persons...

344
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:38,524
who have broken the rules
laid down for their behavior.

345
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,231
We shall pick out certain individuals.

346
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,006
Those we do not designate
will leave immediately.

347
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:52,510
This place will then remain closed
for tonight.

348
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,573
This man.

349
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:58,175
You.

350
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,585
And mademoiselle.

351
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,628
Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

352
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:11,662
Come with me, please.

353
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:27,938
I tell you, I didn't know those men.
They came in for a drink. That's all I know.

354
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:30,474
- You say you never saw these men before?
- No.

355
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:33,277
What are your sympathies, Monsieur Gerard?

356
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:34,445
I am for France.

357
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:37,151
That is well. Try to remain so.

358
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,529
Let us suggest to Monsieur Gerard...

359
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:45,365
that the next time suspicious characters
enter his place...

360
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:47,463
that he notify us.

361
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:51,601
In that way he may prevent bloodshed
at his doorstep.

362
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:52,997
I run a public place.

363
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,432
How am I to know who is suspicious
and who is not?

364
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:58,836
- I think you will know. Good night.
- That is all. You may go.

365
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:01,305
- Got all of them?
- Beauclere and Emil got away.

366
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,474
- How?
- Jumped off the wagon, ran up an alley.

367
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:05,709
- Search all the places on your list.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:09,450
- Continue.
- Did you know these men?

369
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:10,614
I didn't.

370
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:13,184
- You did not see them at all in the café?
- Right.

371
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,519
What was your connection
with the dead man?

372
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:19,023
- He rented my boat to fish from.
- You mean he had rented it.

373
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:22,693
The tickets in his wallet show
he was to leave Martinique at daylight.

374
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:25,273
There was no money on him
or in his wallet.

375
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:28,168
Only some American travelers checks.

376
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,509
Was that customary with him?

377
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:31,969
There was $60 in it.

378
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,871
- What happened to it?
- I took it.

379
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,815
- Why?
- Because he owed me $825.

380
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:40,251
So at least you had no reason to kill him,
did you?

381
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:44,615
- So it would seem.
- But unfortunately for you, someone did.

382
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,457
As a result of which,
you took it on yourself...

383
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:49,797
to collect a part of the debt.

384
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,298
- That's right.
- You have this money now?

385
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:53,696
If you please.

386
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:07,538
If you please, Capitaine.

387
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,173
This is mine.

388
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:11,048
How do we know that?

389
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,020
Thank you. Do not be concerned.

390
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,749
This money is impounded
by a government which, like your own...

391
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:20,658
is at peace with the world.

392
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:25,261
If your claim is just,
it will be discharged.

393
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:29,066
Mademoiselle. That is all for you.

394
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:36,371
"Browning, Marie. American, age 22."

395
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,636
How long have you been in Fort de France?

396
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,604
I arrived by plane this afternoon.

397
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:43,014
- Residence?
- Hotel Marquis.

398
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:44,708
Where do you come from?

399
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:46,377
Trinidad. Port of Spain.

400
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,946
And before that, from where, mademoiselle?

401
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:52,316
- From home, perhaps?
- No. From Brazil, Rio.

402
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,362
- Alone?
- Yes.

403
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:57,858
- Why did you get off here?
- To buy a new hat.

404
00:30:57,988 --> 00:30:59,089
Why?

405
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,601
To buy a new... hat.

406
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:05,197
Read the label.
Maybe you'll believe me then.

407
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:08,299
I never doubted you, mademoiselle.

408
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,970
It is only your tone
that was objectionable.

409
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,143
I'll ask you again.

410
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,606
Why did you get off here?

411
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:18,375
I didn't have money enough
to go any further.

412
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:21,612
That's better. Where were you
when the shooting occurred?

413
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,480
- I was...
- You don't have to answer.

414
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,282
- Shut up, you.
- Don't answer it.

415
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:28,085
- I told you to shut up.
- Go ahead. Slap me.

416
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,754
Come, Capitaine. This is not a brawl.

417
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,856
We wish to get
to the bottom of this affair.

418
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,025
You'll never do it
by slapping people around.

419
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,927
That's bad luck.

420
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:38,506
We shall see.

421
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:43,408
If we need to question you further,
you will be available at the hotel?

422
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:47,805
I don't know how I'm gonna go any place
when you got my passport and money.

423
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,545
Your passport will be returned to you.

424
00:31:50,707 --> 00:31:52,176
As for the money...

425
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:56,452
if it is yours,
that will arrange itself in good time.

426
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:01,785
Do you suggest I see the American Consul
and have him help you arrange it?

427
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:03,990
That is your privilege.

428
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:07,766
By the way, what are your sympathies?

429
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:10,260
- Minding my own business.
- May I...

430
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,364
I don't need any advice
about continuing to do it, either.

431
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,172
- Good night, Capitaine.
- Let's get out of this.

432
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,921
Say, I don't understand all this.
After all, I just got here.

433
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:32,349
You landed right in the middle
of a small war.

434
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:33,617
What's it all about?

435
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:37,255
The boys we just left joined with Vichy.
You know what that is?

436
00:32:37,387 --> 00:32:40,157
- Vaguely.
- They've got the Navy behind them.

437
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:42,426
- You saw that carrier in the harbor?
- Yeah.

438
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:46,096
The other fellas they were shooting at,
they're the Free French.

439
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:49,700
- You know what they are?
- It's not getting any clearer.

440
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,870
Most of the people on the island,
the natives, are patriots.

441
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,146
They're for de Gaulle, but so far they
haven't been able to do much about it.

442
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:00,778
- Are we in trouble?
- No, Eddie.

443
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,747
- I seen them pick you up and was scared...
- Everything's okay.

444
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:05,482
Go back and get some sleep.

445
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:07,684
I'd have got you out. You know me.

446
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:10,254
I know you, Eddie.
You go on back to the boat.

447
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,822
- Harry, could you...
- No.

448
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:14,425
- But...
- No more tonight, Eddie. Beat it.

449
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,073
- I could use a drink myself.
- We can get one in here.

450
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:04,041
What do you wish to drink, sir?

451
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:05,313
What'll it....

452
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:09,420
We're just looking around.

453
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:11,749
Change your mind?

454
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:14,051
No money. Those guys cleaned me out.

455
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,425
I forgot, too.

456
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:18,227
Maybe I can do something.

457
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:21,202
This has been a long day, and I'm thirsty.

458
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,539
Picked him out yet?

459
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,030
You don't mind, do you?

460
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,306
If you're thirsty, go ahead.
If I get tired of waiting I'll be at the hotel.

461
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:33,005
All right.

462
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,117
May I?

463
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:49,653
Thanks.

464
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,121
Hello.

465
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:27,060
Come on in.

466
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,940
- You're sore, aren't you?
- Why should I be?

467
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,848
- I didn't behave very well, did I?
- You did all right.

468
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:43,440
You got the bottle, didn't you?

469
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,510
- You're sore, aren't you?
- Get this straight. I don't give...

470
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,279
I know. You don't give a whoop what I do.

471
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:53,384
But when I do it you get sore.
After all, you told me to, you know.

472
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,788
- I told you?
- You said go ahead, didn't you?

473
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,335
That's right. I guess I did.
You were pretty good at it, too.

474
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:03,294
Thanks.

475
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,929
- Would you rather I wouldn't?
- Wouldn't what?

476
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:07,531
Do things like that.

477
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,441
- Why ask me?
- I'd like to know.

478
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,171
- Of all the screwy...
- All right. I won't do it anymore.

479
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:16,173
- I didn't ask...
- I know you didn't.

480
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:19,379
Don't worry.
I'm not giving up anything I care about.

481
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:23,080
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel, anyway.

482
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,093
Men like that. They're all a bunch of....

483
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:31,562
I'm a fine one to talk.
The pot calling the kettle.

484
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:35,466
How long have you been away from home?

485
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:38,539
- This is about the time for it, isn't it?
- Time for what?

486
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:41,708
The story of my life.
Where do you want me to begin?

487
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,937
I got a pretty fair idea already.

488
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,005
- Who told you?
- You did.

489
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:49,139
- That slap in the face you took.
- What about it?

490
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,812
You hardly blinked an eye.
It takes a lot of practice to do that.

491
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:56,220
Yeah, I know a lot about you, Slim.

492
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:59,923
The next time I get slapped
I better do something about it.

493
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,219
- You forgot your drink.
- I don't want it.

494
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,060
- Who's sore now?
- I am.

495
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:26,481
- Who is it?
- It's me.

496
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,946
The door's unlocked.

497
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:33,222
- You forgot your bottle.
- I said I didn't want it.

498
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:38,060
You are sore, aren't you?

499
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,791
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer me.

500
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,793
I said you're sore, aren't you?

501
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,295
Look, I'm tired
and I want to get some sleep.

502
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:48,308
That's not a bad idea.
What made you so mad?

503
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:52,675
- I've been mad ever since I met you.
- Most people are.

504
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:56,339
One look and you decided
just what you wanted to think about me.

505
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,942
You were.... What's the use?

506
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:01,416
Go ahead. Keep on going.

507
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:04,086
You don't know me, Steve.

508
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:07,092
It doesn't work.

509
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,157
I brought that bottle up here
to make you feel cheap.

510
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,162
That didn't work either.

511
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,335
Instead, I'm the one who feels cheap.

512
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:21,369
I've never felt that way before.

513
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:26,073
I wanted....

514
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:30,218
I thought that maybe....

515
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:42,787
Go on. Get out of here
before I make a complete fool of myself.

516
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,637
How long have you been away from home?

517
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:55,308
It's none of....

518
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,144
About six months.

519
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:00,640
Going back?

520
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:03,716
- How?
- What are you gonna do here?

521
00:39:04,774 --> 00:39:07,186
I don't know. Get a job, maybe.

522
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:11,491
Jobs are hard to get.
I don't think you'd like it here anyway.

523
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,030
Remind you of somebody, Steve?

524
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:21,333
This is brand new to me. I like it.

525
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,195
Would you go back if you could?

526
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:26,166
I'd walk...

527
00:39:28,164 --> 00:39:30,201
if it wasn't for all that water.

528
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:50,292
Quit worrying, kid.
You'll get back all right.

529
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,250
- What the....
- Here's that bottle again.

530
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:22,562
It's getting to be quite
a problem, isn't it?

531
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,025
- You want a drink?
- No.

532
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,459
I thought you were tired and going to bed.

533
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,163
I know. I thought so, too.
You gave me something to think about.

534
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:36,333
- You said you might be able to help me.
- That's right.

535
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,435
But how can you do that if....

536
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,739
Are you gonna take that job with those
men that were up here with Frenchy?

537
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,275
Yeah, if I can find what's left of them.

538
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:49,152
I flew over Devil's Island.
It doesn't look like a high-class resort.

539
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:52,249
- That's what I heard.
- I don't want to be the cause...

540
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:56,559
Don't get the idea I'm doing this
just to help you. I need money, too.

541
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:04,394
Won't Frenchy help you out
without you having to do that?

542
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:06,098
I don't want his help.

543
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,434
Don't do it, will you, Steve?

544
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:11,478
- Look, didn't you ask me...
- Don't do it.

545
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:15,640
Why don't you take this bottle
and go to bed?

546
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,818
Here. Can you can use this?

547
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:22,182
I thought you said you were broke.

548
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:26,292
You're good. You're awful good.

549
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,260
"I'd walk home
if it wasn't for all that water."

550
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:37,771
- Who was the girl, Steve?
- Who was what girl?

551
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,931
The one who left you
with such a high opinion of women.

552
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,033
She must have been quite a gal.

553
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,169
You think I lied to you about this,
don't you?

554
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,538
It just happens there's about $30 here.

555
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:51,341
Not enough for boat fare
or any other kind of fare.

556
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,377
Just enough to be able to say "no"
if I feel like it.

557
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:56,889
And you can have it if you want it.

558
00:41:58,548 --> 00:41:59,925
I'm sorry, Slim.

559
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:04,154
But I still say you're awful good
and I wouldn't...

560
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:07,824
I forgot. You wouldn't take anything
from anybody, would you?

561
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,164
That's right.

562
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:11,938
You know, Steve...

563
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:16,604
you're not very hard to figure.
Only at times.

564
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:20,337
Sometimes I know exactly
what you're going to say.

565
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,748
Most of the time. The other times....

566
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:29,787
The other times you're just a stinker.

567
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:39,723
- What did you do that for?
- I've been wondering whether I'd like it.

568
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,325
What's the decision?

569
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,469
I don't know yet.

570
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,203
It's even better when you help.

571
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,585
Sure you won't change your mind
about this?

572
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,447
This belongs to me, and so do my lips.
I don't see any difference.

573
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:05,548
I do.

574
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:07,517
Okay.

575
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:11,688
You know you don't have to act with me.

576
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:14,924
You don't have to say anything
and you don't have to do anything.

577
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,230
Not a thing.

578
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,903
Maybe just whistle.

579
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:26,536
You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?

580
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,480
You just put your lips together and blow.

581
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:54,237
Here, chick.

582
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,276
You keep watching.

583
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,112
It's all right. They have gone.

584
00:44:12,313 --> 00:44:13,383
Go on.

585
00:44:14,315 --> 00:44:17,151
You come along the lee shore of Anguilla
from the south.

586
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:18,987
About three kilometers from the point.

587
00:44:19,087 --> 00:44:22,125
- There's a little cove and a jetty?
- You know it, then.

588
00:44:22,423 --> 00:44:24,592
- The signal's been arranged?
- Emil can show you.

589
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:26,194
- Emil's not gonna be there.
- Why?

590
00:44:26,294 --> 00:44:28,672
I'm doing this my way. I'm going alone.

591
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:31,466
What are the signals?

592
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:34,736
You flash a light to the shore.
They will answer it with two lights.

593
00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:37,739
One held above the other.
There'll be two people to bring back.

594
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,607
- How'll I know them?
- We've never seen them.

595
00:44:39,707 --> 00:44:42,010
We know the name of one only.
Paul de Bursac.

596
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,313
That's good enough.
How about landing them back here?

597
00:44:45,413 --> 00:44:47,282
Do you know Cape Sainte-Pierre?

598
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:51,085
- A boat can meet you offshore there.
- You be on that boat, Frenchy.

599
00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:53,688
I'll get out of here around noon.
Supposedly fishing.

600
00:44:53,788 --> 00:44:57,191
With luck and no patrol boats,
I'll be back in Sainte-Pierre at midnight.

601
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,761
I won't be burning any lights,
so keep a sharp lookout.

602
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:01,465
One thing, Mr. Morgan.

603
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:05,366
Last night you very definitely refused
to have anything to do with us.

604
00:45:05,466 --> 00:45:07,135
Why have you changed your mind?

605
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:09,537
I need the money now. Last night I didn't.

606
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:12,674
- If you knew what this means to us....
- I don't want to know.

607
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:14,309
I'm glad you're on our side.

608
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:16,252
I'm not. I'm getting paid.

609
00:45:16,944 --> 00:45:19,720
And by the way, I'd like that money now.

610
00:45:20,915 --> 00:45:24,419
If I were you, I do not think
I would trust Mr. Morgan.

611
00:45:27,755 --> 00:45:29,223
Did a doctor look at his leg?

612
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:32,293
No. They are watching all doctors
who are friendly to us.

613
00:45:32,393 --> 00:45:34,896
- Miss the bone?
- As far as I can tell.

614
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:36,964
He's lucky.
Why did you put a pillow under it?

615
00:45:37,064 --> 00:45:39,267
- Why not?
- It doesn't hurt so much that way.

616
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,336
It'll have to hurt,
you'll have to take it...

617
00:45:41,436 --> 00:45:44,272
unless you want to take a chance
of gangrene setting in.

618
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:45,773
All right, I'll take that.

619
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:47,250
Are you a doctor?

620
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:50,646
No. But I've handled
quite a lot of gunshot wounds.

621
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:52,914
You can trust me now.

622
00:45:53,014 --> 00:45:54,391
Good luck, Harry.

623
00:45:57,018 --> 00:45:58,326
It's all right.

624
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:11,837
- More café, mademoiselle?
- Please.

625
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:21,209
- What is that you're playing?
- Did you say something?

626
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:22,910
What's the name of that tune?

627
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:26,685
It hasn't got any name yet.
I've just been fooling with the lyrics.

628
00:46:26,848 --> 00:46:29,617
They're not so hot, either.
Would you like to hear them?

629
00:46:29,717 --> 00:46:30,752
Sure.

630
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:16,167
So it goes.

631
00:47:17,198 --> 00:47:19,400
- That's about as far as it goes.
- I like it.

632
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,776
Yes. If I could get the right lyrics.

633
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:34,715
- Good morning, Cricket.
- Morning, Harry.

634
00:47:34,815 --> 00:47:36,250
- Good morning, Slim.
- Hello.

635
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,820
- How did you sleep?
- The best in a long time.

636
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,560
- Have some coffee?
- No, thanks. I've had mine.

637
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:44,425
You were up early. What were you doing?

638
00:47:44,525 --> 00:47:48,196
I was getting you a ticket on the plane
this afternoon. It leaves at 4:00.

639
00:47:48,296 --> 00:47:50,276
- Can you make it?
- Sure.

640
00:47:52,033 --> 00:47:53,979
You took that job, didn't you?

641
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:57,972
See, I figured this way
you wouldn't get your feet wet.

642
00:47:58,072 --> 00:47:59,574
Yeah. That's right.

643
00:47:59,674 --> 00:48:02,154
- That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
- Sure.

644
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:03,514
I just....

645
00:48:06,547 --> 00:48:09,994
- You want me to go, don't you?
- Yes, I want you to go.

646
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:12,496
Okay, Steve.

647
00:48:12,887 --> 00:48:14,989
Help her get on that plane,
will you, Cricket?

648
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:16,524
I sure will, Harry.

649
00:48:16,624 --> 00:48:20,663
I'm gonna be pretty busy from now on,
so I probably won't see you again.

650
00:48:21,195 --> 00:48:23,164
- If I ever get up your way...
- Yeah. Do that.

651
00:48:23,264 --> 00:48:26,677
I'll leave my address with Frenchy
so you can find me.

652
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:30,007
Maybe I'll know how to whistle by then.

653
00:48:30,471 --> 00:48:32,781
- So long, Slim.
- So long, Steve.

654
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:43,360
Well, it was nice while it lasted.

655
00:48:44,085 --> 00:48:46,190
Maybe it's better this way, Slim.

656
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:47,794
I don't know.

657
00:48:48,723 --> 00:48:51,602
You haven't known him very long.
He's a funny guy.

658
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,378
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- Fine. I told you to stay at the hotel.

659
00:49:10,478 --> 00:49:12,947
- I knew you was going out.
- Who told you that?

660
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:15,616
You can't fool me, Harry.
I knew it just as plain.

661
00:49:15,716 --> 00:49:18,452
- Say, could I have a little...
- You're not going.

662
00:49:18,552 --> 00:49:22,022
Could I have a little one,
just enough to fill a hen's ear?

663
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,458
- Come on, Eddie. Get off.
- What's the matter?

664
00:49:24,558 --> 00:49:28,005
There's no sense in getting plugged at me.
Take it easy. You got...

665
00:49:38,773 --> 00:49:40,241
I wouldn't do that to you.

666
00:49:40,341 --> 00:49:43,444
You're right, you wouldn't.
I'm not gonna carry you, that's all.

667
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:46,614
- What did you have to hit me for?
- So you'd believe me.

668
00:49:46,714 --> 00:49:49,317
- You ain't treating me square.
- Who do you treat square?

669
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:52,553
You'd double-cross your own mother.
You told me so yourself.

670
00:49:52,653 --> 00:49:54,132
I was only kidding.

671
00:50:02,963 --> 00:50:05,637
Thanks, Harry. I knew you was my pal.

672
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,472
- But why won't you carry me?
- Because I don't want you.

673
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:12,206
You know, you're just plugged.

674
00:50:12,306 --> 00:50:15,515
Never mind, old pal,
you'll be glad to see me yet.

675
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:43,113
All right. Come out of there.

676
00:50:45,106 --> 00:50:47,086
It's only me, Harry.

677
00:50:48,242 --> 00:50:49,877
How did you get back on board?

678
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:51,946
I went up the street for some bottles.

679
00:50:52,046 --> 00:50:54,582
Then I sneaked in
while you was working on the engine.

680
00:50:54,682 --> 00:50:56,717
- I knew you'd carry me.
- Carry you, nothing.

681
00:50:56,817 --> 00:50:59,387
If I thought you could swim back
I'd dump you overboard.

682
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:02,657
You're a joker. We've got to stick together
when we're in trouble.

683
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:06,899
- How do you know I'm in trouble?
- You can't fool me. I always know.

684
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,496
Where we going, Harry?

685
00:51:08,596 --> 00:51:10,398
What would you do if somebody shot at you?

686
00:51:10,498 --> 00:51:12,136
Shot at me? With a gun?

687
00:51:14,435 --> 00:51:17,678
- Who's gonna shoot at me?
- If you're lucky, nobody.

688
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,242
Where we going? What're we gonna do?

689
00:51:21,342 --> 00:51:24,111
I'll tell you when the time comes.
Get out some tackle.

690
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:25,952
Aren't you glad you came?

691
00:51:26,914 --> 00:51:28,018
No.

692
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:43,708
- Here. Put this on. It's getting cold.
- I'm all right, Harry.

693
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:54,615
Say, what's going on?

694
00:51:55,543 --> 00:51:57,648
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

695
00:51:58,112 --> 00:52:01,286
Yes, there is, too.
What's all the darn guns for?

696
00:52:02,149 --> 00:52:04,218
In case we run into a shark or something.

697
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:05,922
A shark? At night?

698
00:52:07,888 --> 00:52:10,891
Or something?
What do you mean, "or something"?

699
00:52:10,991 --> 00:52:13,127
- Watch your course.
- What's the matter?

700
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:16,163
We're going on a job.
I'll tell you what to do when it's time.

701
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:17,298
A job?

702
00:52:18,332 --> 00:52:21,074
What kind of a job?
What do you expect me to do?

703
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:22,803
Do you know how to handle this?

704
00:52:22,903 --> 00:52:25,740
Of course I know how.
Everybody knows how to handle a gun.

705
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,310
All you do is work the lever
and pull the trigger. You know I know that.

706
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:33,358
Such foolish questions.
Do I know how to handle a gun.

707
00:52:38,586 --> 00:52:42,056
- What do I got to work a gun for?
- I just wondered if you could.

708
00:52:42,156 --> 00:52:43,357
You know I can.

709
00:52:43,457 --> 00:52:46,700
Harry, sometimes you act stupid.
Just plain stupid.

710
00:52:46,894 --> 00:52:50,774
Sometimes I think you don't pay
no attention to nothing I say.

711
00:52:55,603 --> 00:52:57,571
Is it gonna be that bad, Harry?

712
00:52:57,671 --> 00:53:00,811
I don't know yet.
It all depends on how lucky we are.

713
00:53:06,513 --> 00:53:08,582
That's why you didn't want to carry me.

714
00:53:08,682 --> 00:53:12,630
I knew there was some other reason.
You wasn't mad at me at all.

715
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:19,393
You was afraid I'd get hurt.
You was thinking of me.

716
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:21,234
Watch your course, Eddie.

717
00:53:22,096 --> 00:53:25,976
I feel better now, Harry.
I'll be all right. You'll see.

718
00:53:36,744 --> 00:53:40,021
What's the matter?
What are you looking at me like that for?

719
00:53:41,181 --> 00:53:42,650
What are you laughing at?

720
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,419
Just a joke that neither one of us
knows the answer to.

721
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:46,554
What joke?

722
00:53:46,654 --> 00:53:48,589
Whether you're gonna hold together or not.

723
00:53:48,689 --> 00:53:51,727
Don't say that, Harry.
I'm a good man. You know I am.

724
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:55,835
You are, but you're going
all over the ocean. Stay on your course.

725
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,768
Why do you always....

726
00:54:01,001 --> 00:54:04,039
Could I have just one?
I don't want to get the shakes.

727
00:54:04,505 --> 00:54:07,575
Make it a short one.
I want you rum-brave, not useless.

728
00:54:07,675 --> 00:54:09,018
Thanks, Harry.

729
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,505
What's the matter, Harry?

730
00:54:49,383 --> 00:54:53,297
- Who's that? What are we going to do?
- Pick up a couple of guys.

731
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:57,057
Here's what I want you to do.
Take this gun and get back in the stern.

732
00:54:57,157 --> 00:55:00,027
If there's any trouble, start shooting.
But don't shoot me.

733
00:55:00,127 --> 00:55:02,863
Supposing something happens to you?
What do I do then?

734
00:55:02,963 --> 00:55:06,137
How do I know?
You invited yourself on this trip, not me.

735
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,174
All right, get back there.

736
00:55:34,795 --> 00:55:37,164
My name's Harry Morgan. Beauclere sent me.

737
00:55:37,264 --> 00:55:38,709
Get that light out of my face.

738
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,937
- What happened to Beauclere?
- He ran into a little trouble.

739
00:55:43,037 --> 00:55:44,948
- What's your name?
- De Bursac.

740
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:48,015
That's the name. It's all right, Eddie.

741
00:55:48,642 --> 00:55:49,950
Come on aboard.

742
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:52,880
Wait a minute.
He didn't say anything about a woman.

743
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,416
Permit me.
This is my wife, Madame de Bursac.

744
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:56,884
How do you do?

745
00:55:56,984 --> 00:55:59,021
What do you want to bring a....

746
00:56:02,923 --> 00:56:05,836
It's your funeral. Let's get out of here.

747
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:26,784
All right, Eddie. You can relax now.

748
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:30,654
Don't unload. We're not home yet.

749
00:56:31,218 --> 00:56:33,892
If she gets cold,
you can put her down in the cabin.

750
00:56:35,355 --> 00:56:37,266
Mr. Morgan, just who are you?

751
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:41,628
I own this boat. Beauclere's paying me
to get you people back to Martinique.

752
00:56:41,728 --> 00:56:44,299
You're not one of us.
You're not on our side.

753
00:56:44,765 --> 00:56:46,200
I don't understand.

754
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,969
I don't understand
what kind of a war you're fighting...

755
00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:52,373
lugging your wives with you.
Don't you get enough of them at home?

756
00:56:52,473 --> 00:56:54,742
- You say you're being paid for this.
- That's right.

757
00:56:54,842 --> 00:56:57,544
Then I suggest you stop talking
and take us to Martinique.

758
00:56:57,644 --> 00:56:59,920
That's where we're heading right now.

759
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:31,419
- What's the matter, Harry?
- Keep quiet.

760
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:34,920
I thought I saw something out there.

761
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:38,521
Listen.

762
00:57:44,324 --> 00:57:46,060
- What is it?
- I don't know.

763
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,367
Shut up. You hear that?

764
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:51,134
Is it the patrol boat?

765
00:57:51,498 --> 00:57:55,446
Don't you know those engines?
Sounds like she's off there.

766
00:57:59,706 --> 00:58:02,309
Stand by that wheel.
Wait a minute. Give me that gun.

767
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:04,344
You can't fight them guys, Harry.

768
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:05,813
What's the matter with you?

769
00:58:05,913 --> 00:58:08,082
You ought to be telling me
how good you are.

770
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:10,662
I can do it. What do you want me to do?

771
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:15,122
If we're lucky, nothing. If we're not,
hook her up and get away from here fast.

772
00:58:15,222 --> 00:58:18,225
- What does this mean, Mr. Morgan?
- Trouble, if they see us.

773
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:20,828
- What can we do?
- You can't do anything.

774
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:23,768
Just get down on the deck, flat,
and stay there.

775
00:58:23,964 --> 00:58:25,499
But I don't know what good it'll do.

776
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,569
- If you try to resist, we will be killed.
- Shut up, both of you.

777
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:30,410
Get down on the deck, flat.

778
00:58:30,704 --> 00:58:33,116
You save France. I want to save my boat.

779
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:36,252
Hook her up, Eddie. Let's go.

780
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:40,685
Don't shoot!

781
00:59:01,168 --> 00:59:02,647
We got lucky again.

782
00:59:04,705 --> 00:59:08,517
Ease her off and put her on 160
and then get that first-aid kit.

783
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,385
That's not so bad.

784
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:21,221
You wouldn't have that
if you weren't so anxious to give up.

785
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:22,923
Please help me get him on the seat.

786
00:59:23,023 --> 00:59:25,559
Leave him. I don't want him
bleeding over my cushion.

787
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:28,401
- Here you are, Harry.
- You can have a drink now.

788
00:59:28,562 --> 00:59:29,836
Thanks, Harry.

789
00:59:31,231 --> 00:59:32,972
Help me off with his coat.

790
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:36,142
Easy now, boy.

791
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:51,251
All right. Get ready.

792
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:53,754
The man in that boat
will take you on from here.

793
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:55,656
But I don't understand.

794
00:59:55,756 --> 00:59:58,458
Some people spent a lot of time
figuring this thing out.

795
00:59:58,558 --> 01:00:00,731
They know more about it than we do.

796
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:13,716
This is de Bursac.

797
01:00:14,107 --> 01:00:17,110
He's the other guy
I was supposed to pick up. His wife.

798
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,146
- My name is Gerard.
- How do you do?

799
01:00:19,246 --> 01:00:22,015
- Easy with him. He's been shot up a little.
- What happened?

800
01:00:22,115 --> 01:00:24,925
We ran into a patrol boat.
They'll tell you about it.

801
01:00:27,988 --> 01:00:30,757
I'll cruise around
and give you a chance to get ashore.

802
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:32,530
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

803
01:00:51,278 --> 01:00:53,053
Good evening, Mama.

804
01:01:01,088 --> 01:01:04,535
- I thought you said she pulled out.
- I thought she did.

805
01:01:20,374 --> 01:01:21,614
Hello, Steve.

806
01:01:22,142 --> 01:01:23,744
You were going to put her on a plane.

807
01:01:23,844 --> 01:01:27,014
- What's the matter? Didn't it go?
- It went. But I decided not to.

808
01:01:27,114 --> 01:01:30,250
You did? I went to a lot of trouble
to get you out of here.

809
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,261
- That's why I didn't go.
- Yeah.

810
01:01:33,653 --> 01:01:36,930
You dames.
A guy goes out and breaks his neck to....

811
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:39,726
I might have expected it.

812
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:44,498
You're not sore, are you?

813
01:01:44,598 --> 01:01:47,768
- It'd be all right...
- I got a refund on that ticket. Here.

814
01:01:47,868 --> 01:01:50,037
That's gonna help a lot.
You better hang onto it.

815
01:01:50,137 --> 01:01:51,872
- We can use...
- She'll buy it for you.

816
01:01:51,972 --> 01:01:54,041
- Nothing but beer for him.
- I'll remember.

817
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:56,143
We'll be all right. I've got a job.

818
01:01:56,243 --> 01:01:59,656
- Doing what?
- Frenchy seems to think I can sing.

819
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:01,325
It's his place.

820
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:03,884
Sometimes you make me so mad I could...

821
01:02:03,984 --> 01:02:05,152
You could do what?

822
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:06,754
Harry, I need your help.

823
01:02:06,987 --> 01:02:08,330
What is it now?

824
01:02:09,222 --> 01:02:10,590
That's all right. Go ahead.

825
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,626
That man is very badly wounded, Harry.

826
01:02:12,726 --> 01:02:15,762
I looked at him. The bullet hit the gunnel,
it was almost spent.

827
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:18,565
- All you got to do is take it out.
- Could you do it?

828
01:02:18,665 --> 01:02:22,135
Me? I'm hotter than any doctor.
They would have recognized my boat.

829
01:02:22,235 --> 01:02:23,403
They'll be on my tail soon.

830
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:26,506
- All I got to do is walk out of here.
- You don't have to go out.

831
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:29,177
- You didn't bring them here?
- In the cellar.

832
01:02:29,709 --> 01:02:32,746
Why didn't you put them
in a goldfish bowl and be done with it?

833
01:02:32,846 --> 01:02:36,316
We had to do something.
They're watching every road out of town.

834
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:38,752
See what you got yourself into
by sticking around?

835
01:02:38,852 --> 01:02:40,420
I'm ready to go any time you are.

836
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,660
- Please, Harry, will you do it?
- Not a chance, Frenchy.

837
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:47,327
Your bill here at the hotel,
being overdue...

838
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:50,533
amounts to 6,356 francs.

839
01:02:50,897 --> 01:02:52,599
She's right, Eddie.

840
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:54,701
You really keep the books, don't you?

841
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:58,840
We'll be glad to dismiss the whole matter
if you will do this for us.

842
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:02,042
- Throw her bill in, too?
- Sure thing.

843
01:03:02,142 --> 01:03:05,180
- All I got to do is take the bullet out...
- That's all.

844
01:03:06,012 --> 01:03:09,349
You almost had me figured right, Mama,
except for one thing.

845
01:03:09,449 --> 01:03:10,851
I'll still owe you that bill.

846
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:12,652
Up in my room you'll find a medical kit.

847
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:14,855
It's gray, this big,
has the boat's name on it.

848
01:03:14,955 --> 01:03:16,901
- Bring it to the cellar.
- Sure.

849
01:03:17,023 --> 01:03:19,092
Here's the key. Bring some hot water, too.

850
01:03:19,192 --> 01:03:20,569
This way, Harry.

851
01:03:23,964 --> 01:03:24,965
Can I help?

852
01:03:25,065 --> 01:03:27,834
Just stay out of sight.
If you run across the police...

853
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:31,347
- don't forget what I told you to tell them.
- What was that, Harry?

854
01:03:32,472 --> 01:03:34,383
Just stay out of sight, Eddie.

855
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:36,079
I remember.

856
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:02,702
What do you want here?

857
01:04:02,802 --> 01:04:05,071
I'll tell you. I was sort of invited.
He asked me.

858
01:04:05,171 --> 01:04:06,506
- You're not a doctor.
- No.

859
01:04:06,606 --> 01:04:08,375
- Where's the doctor?
- Please, be patient.

860
01:04:08,475 --> 01:04:10,844
I have been patient.
How do I know you know anything?

861
01:04:10,944 --> 01:04:13,083
- You don't.
- Wait a minute.

862
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:30,864
How long has he been unconscious?

863
01:04:30,964 --> 01:04:32,443
Just a few minutes.

864
01:04:45,478 --> 01:04:48,014
He's got some fever
and his pulse is a little low.

865
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:50,183
He'll be all right
when we get the bullet out.

866
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:53,353
- Don't touch him. Do you hear?
- That's okay. I'm not getting paid.

867
01:04:53,453 --> 01:04:55,856
She doesn't know what she's saying.
She's not herself.

868
01:04:55,956 --> 01:04:58,334
- Who is she?
- Harry, you promised.

869
01:04:59,326 --> 01:05:02,395
You want to help your husband, don't you?
Then use your head.

870
01:05:02,495 --> 01:05:04,798
We can't get a doctor
without giving the show away.

871
01:05:04,898 --> 01:05:07,567
Besides, he's got as good a chance
with me as anybody.

872
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:09,135
I'm not going to let you do it.

873
01:05:09,235 --> 01:05:11,238
Why not?
He's no different from anybody else.

874
01:05:11,338 --> 01:05:15,047
Just a little sicker, that's all.
It means he's not worth so much.

875
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:21,248
You can have another crack at me later on.

876
01:05:21,348 --> 01:05:22,749
- Hello, Slim.
- Hello.

877
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:24,317
Miss Browning, Madame de Bursac.

878
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:27,020
Don't get tough with Slim.
She's apt to slap you back.

879
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,532
That's what you said you'd do, wasn't it?

880
01:05:29,723 --> 01:05:31,430
Bring the water in here.

881
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:33,593
- Wait a minute....
- He's trying to help you.

882
01:05:33,693 --> 01:05:36,765
- Who are you?
- Nobody. Just another volunteer.

883
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:42,873
- Where do you want this water?
- In that basin.

884
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:45,316
- Is it hot?
- Boiling.

885
01:05:47,674 --> 01:05:50,985
All right, then. Pour some of this in it.
And drop these in.

886
01:05:54,014 --> 01:05:57,325
- Get out of here. You may not like this.
- I'll be all right.

887
01:05:59,052 --> 01:06:00,360
Then take this.

888
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:02,923
- What is it?
- Chloroform.

889
01:06:03,023 --> 01:06:05,892
Get over by his head.
If he comes to while I'm probing...

890
01:06:05,992 --> 01:06:09,269
pour some of it on a hunk of cotton
and give him a whiff of it.

891
01:06:09,863 --> 01:06:11,968
Don't open it till I tell you to.

892
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,311
Take out about four of those.

893
01:06:19,873 --> 01:06:23,377
George, bring that lamp a little closer
so I can see what I'm doing.

894
01:06:31,718 --> 01:06:32,890
That's good.

895
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:38,428
All right, Slim.

896
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,071
Hold that a minute.

897
01:06:51,171 --> 01:06:52,445
Easy, boy.

898
01:06:53,273 --> 01:06:55,508
All right, open that can
and give him some.

899
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:58,282
George, see if you can hold his head down.

900
01:06:58,445 --> 01:06:59,856
Come on, hurry up.

901
01:07:01,948 --> 01:07:05,327
That's fine. Don't worry about her.
Pick up that can.

902
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:09,865
- Any of it left?
- I think there's enough.

903
01:07:13,827 --> 01:07:17,240
Wait a minute, I don't think we'll need it.
He's out, too.

904
01:07:18,364 --> 01:07:20,571
Bring that lamp down a little lower.

905
01:07:22,035 --> 01:07:24,242
Frenchy, bring that basin over here.

906
01:07:27,774 --> 01:07:31,312
And fan some of those fumes away,
will you, or we'll all be out.

907
01:07:46,126 --> 01:07:49,039
There you are, Frenchy,
there's your bullet.

908
01:07:49,763 --> 01:07:52,465
I told you it was spent.
It would have smashed the bone.

909
01:07:52,565 --> 01:07:54,545
All right, I don't need that.

910
01:08:09,682 --> 01:08:13,220
All right, you finish bandaging it up.
Adhesive tape in the box.

911
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,963
I got to get nursie out of here,
or she never will come to.

912
01:08:29,536 --> 01:08:32,073
What are you trying to do,
guess her weight?

913
01:08:32,505 --> 01:08:34,416
She's heftier than you think.

914
01:08:40,413 --> 01:08:43,883
- You'd better loosen her clothes.
- You've been doing all right.

915
01:08:47,587 --> 01:08:50,090
Maybe you'd better look after her husband.

916
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,998
- He's not gonna run out on me.
- Neither is she.

917
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,573
Is it all right
if I give her a little whiff of this?

918
01:09:19,485 --> 01:09:21,294
You're with us again.

919
01:09:22,188 --> 01:09:24,395
You were lucky. You passed out.

920
01:09:25,892 --> 01:09:27,827
What happened? We must....

921
01:09:27,927 --> 01:09:31,932
We'll talk about that in the morning.
See if you can get some sleep.

922
01:09:33,132 --> 01:09:34,236
Thanks.

923
01:09:51,618 --> 01:09:54,687
Why did you ever come along with him
on a trip like this?

924
01:09:54,787 --> 01:09:58,701
I love him. I want to be with him.

925
01:10:00,193 --> 01:10:03,402
- That's a reason.
- There's another reason.

926
01:10:04,397 --> 01:10:06,877
They told me to come, our people did.

927
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:14,574
They said no man was much good
if he left someone behind in France...

928
01:10:14,674 --> 01:10:17,086
for the Germans to find and hold.

929
01:10:19,312 --> 01:10:22,982
- That makes sense.
- I told them I'd only be in the way...

930
01:10:23,082 --> 01:10:26,291
that I could do no good,
that I was afraid.

931
01:10:28,922 --> 01:10:32,893
But the worst of it is that it's been
so hard for him to have me along...

932
01:10:35,028 --> 01:10:38,976
because I've made him that way, too.
Now he's afraid.

933
01:10:42,068 --> 01:10:43,843
He didn't invent it.

934
01:10:44,537 --> 01:10:46,642
- Invent what?
- Being afraid.

935
01:10:49,809 --> 01:10:51,288
Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

936
01:11:08,695 --> 01:11:10,333
The fever's gone.

937
01:11:12,498 --> 01:11:14,603
Do you....

938
01:11:14,934 --> 01:11:17,574
I'm no doctor,
but he looks pretty good to me.

939
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:22,619
If he wakes up,
give him another one of these pills.

940
01:11:37,657 --> 01:11:41,332
- Mr. Morgan, I....
- You're not gonna faint again?

941
01:11:42,228 --> 01:11:46,904
No, I'm just having a hard time
trying to say something.

942
01:11:47,033 --> 01:11:49,513
Go ahead, say it. I'm not gonna bite you.

943
01:11:50,703 --> 01:11:53,343
If it hadn't been for you,
Paul might have....

944
01:11:54,741 --> 01:11:56,509
I'm sorry for the way I've acted.

945
01:11:56,609 --> 01:12:00,489
You're not sorry at all, you're just sorry
you made a fool of yourself.

946
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:02,792
I have, haven't I?

947
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:09,132
You don't make me angry when you say that.

948
01:12:09,889 --> 01:12:13,268
I don't think I'll ever be angry again
with anything you say.

949
01:12:14,327 --> 01:12:16,529
Another screwy dame. Now, how can you....

950
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:20,600
Good morning. I hate to break this up,
but I've brought some breakfast.

951
01:12:22,702 --> 01:12:24,671
- Good morning.
- How's your patient?

952
01:12:24,771 --> 01:12:27,573
- He'll be all right...
- Or haven't you looked lately?

953
01:12:27,673 --> 01:12:31,143
He'll be all right.
I'll be back this evening.

954
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:34,280
- If you need me before then, call me.
- I will.

955
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,816
Yes, and I hope you have everything
you need here.

956
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:38,551
The eggs may be a little hardboiled...

957
01:12:38,651 --> 01:12:42,258
- That's all right, I like them that way.
- You're lucky. Isn't she?

958
01:12:48,694 --> 01:12:51,265
I'm gonna get some sleep,
I'll see you later.

959
01:12:55,601 --> 01:12:56,807
Thanks.

960
01:12:58,204 --> 01:13:00,912
- What do you want?
- I could use a match.

961
01:13:09,849 --> 01:13:12,853
Thanks. Now I need a cigarette.

962
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:27,033
Here, I can do that. Come on, let me help.

963
01:13:27,133 --> 01:13:30,671
When I get ready to take my shoes off,
I'll take them off myself.

964
01:13:32,004 --> 01:13:33,176
All right.

965
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,645
- Want something to eat?
- No.

966
01:13:37,677 --> 01:13:40,980
- Just a little breakfast?
- All I want to do is get some sleep.

967
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,890
It's a good idea. I can help you there.

968
01:13:44,851 --> 01:13:48,697
- Now where are you going?
- I'm going to fix you a nice hot bath.

969
01:13:49,122 --> 01:13:50,857
It'll make you sleep better.

970
01:13:50,957 --> 01:13:54,660
I don't want you to take my shoes off,
I don't want you to get me breakfast...

971
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,696
I don't want you to draw me a hot bath...

972
01:13:56,796 --> 01:13:59,866
- I don't want you to...
- Isn't there anything I can do, Steve?

973
01:13:59,966 --> 01:14:02,502
- Yes, get the...
- You know, Mr. Morgan...

974
01:14:02,602 --> 01:14:05,171
you don't make me angry when you say that.

975
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:08,980
I don't think I'll ever be angry again
at anything you say.

976
01:14:12,812 --> 01:14:15,481
How am I doing, Steve,
does it work the second time?

977
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:18,721
You've been wanting
to do something for me, haven't you?

978
01:14:25,057 --> 01:14:26,593
Walk around me.

979
01:14:27,293 --> 01:14:29,773
Go ahead, walk around me, clear around.

980
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:43,812
- Did you find anything?
- No.

981
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:49,589
No, Steve. There are no strings
tied to you, not yet.

982
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:05,737
I like that...

983
01:15:10,136 --> 01:15:11,672
except for the beard.

984
01:15:13,372 --> 01:15:15,249
Why don't you shave...

985
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,146
and we'll try it again.

986
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,652
- Later, Frenchy.
- Harry, wait.

987
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:29,489
Renard, the Inspector, is downstairs.
You better come down.

988
01:15:29,589 --> 01:15:32,331
- I can't do that, I got to shave.
- He's got Eddie.

989
01:15:33,559 --> 01:15:35,928
He's giving him drinks
and asking him questions.

990
01:15:36,028 --> 01:15:37,735
I was afraid of that.

991
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:40,733
Good thing you didn't get me in that tub.

992
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:44,670
Look out for those strings, Steve.
You're liable to trip and break your neck.

993
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:48,650
- Strings? I didn't see any strings.
- They just don't show, Frenchy.

994
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:53,079
You ought to have seen that fish.

995
01:15:53,179 --> 01:15:55,314
It must have weighed 900
if it weighed a pound.

996
01:15:55,414 --> 01:15:58,217
It was the biggest marlin you ever seen
in all your born days.

997
01:15:58,317 --> 01:15:59,986
You know, a marlin is a swordfish.

998
01:16:00,086 --> 01:16:03,089
- Good morning, Capitaine.
- Hello, Harry. How's everything?

999
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:04,757
- Fine.
- Won't you join us?

1000
01:16:04,857 --> 01:16:07,126
It's a little early
for this kind of a party.

1001
01:16:07,226 --> 01:16:08,327
Continue, Mr. Eddie.

1002
01:16:08,427 --> 01:16:10,329
Did you hear that? He called me mister.

1003
01:16:10,429 --> 01:16:12,136
Say, you're all right.

1004
01:16:12,565 --> 01:16:15,368
- Was you ever bit by a...
- No, he never was, Eddie.

1005
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:17,136
Go on with what you were saying.

1006
01:16:17,236 --> 01:16:20,740
I was just telling him about the big one
we hooked onto last night.

1007
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,443
Sir, that fish was so big
that me and Harry could hardly budge him.

1008
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:27,180
We pumped on him
until we was all wore out, didn't we?

1009
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,782
That's right, Eddie.

1010
01:16:29,081 --> 01:16:31,584
It was after dark
and we was still playing him.

1011
01:16:31,684 --> 01:16:35,928
He must have weighed at least 1,000 easy.

1012
01:16:37,123 --> 01:16:41,128
Every time Mr. Eddie takes a drink,
this fabulous fish grows larger.

1013
01:16:41,327 --> 01:16:43,898
He must have started
with a pretty small one.

1014
01:16:44,797 --> 01:16:47,200
How did you finally manage
to land such a leviathan?

1015
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,901
We didn't, didn't he tell you?

1016
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:51,604
- We ran into a German submarine.
- A German submarine?

1017
01:16:51,704 --> 01:16:54,140
Whatever it was,
it turned its light on and fired.

1018
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,175
- I didn't wait to find out.
- I do not think...

1019
01:16:56,275 --> 01:16:58,544
You know,
you can't be too careful these days.

1020
01:16:58,644 --> 01:17:01,647
I do not think anybody
could give a more logical explanation...

1021
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:04,990
for refusing to obey the challenge
of our patrol boat.

1022
01:17:05,518 --> 01:17:07,954
Not to speak of shooting out
their searchlight.

1023
01:17:08,054 --> 01:17:09,288
- Patrol boat?
- Yes.

1024
01:17:09,388 --> 01:17:11,157
That's what it was. You were right, Eddie.

1025
01:17:11,257 --> 01:17:13,226
I'm a good man in the dark, always was.

1026
01:17:13,326 --> 01:17:16,629
Funny, he kept saying it was a patrol boat,
but I wouldn't believe him.

1027
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:20,006
There is one thing that is not clear
to me, Capt. Morgan.

1028
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:21,434
What's that?

1029
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:25,209
Why does a professional fisherman
go fishing for his own amusement?

1030
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:30,550
Don't you ever ask any questions?
Don't you ever talk?

1031
01:17:31,977 --> 01:17:34,380
No, I guess you don't.
What were you saying?

1032
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,553
Does a professional fisherman
go fishing for his own amusement?

1033
01:17:39,151 --> 01:17:41,387
He does if he likes it,
and we do, don't we?

1034
01:17:41,487 --> 01:17:43,522
Yeah, remember in Key West when we went...

1035
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:47,293
- We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
- It was the Fourth of July...

1036
01:17:47,393 --> 01:17:49,729
I was just saying,
Key West, the Fourth of July...

1037
01:17:49,829 --> 01:17:51,664
three years ago at 8:00. I got that in.

1038
01:17:51,764 --> 01:17:53,966
- What about your passengers?
- It was 7:00.

1039
01:17:54,066 --> 01:17:56,469
You oughtn't to burn up at him,
you fed him the rum.

1040
01:17:56,569 --> 01:17:59,205
- What about your two passengers?
- What passengers?

1041
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:01,107
The ones you brought from Anguilla.

1042
01:18:01,207 --> 01:18:03,442
He was waiting on the dock
when we came in.

1043
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:05,344
You think I got them ashore in my sleeve?

1044
01:18:05,444 --> 01:18:08,147
You could have landed them anywhere
on our coastline.

1045
01:18:08,247 --> 01:18:09,649
Right, I could've at that.

1046
01:18:09,749 --> 01:18:13,458
- Would $500 refresh your memory?
- My memory's pretty good.

1047
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:17,056
I remember that you're the guy
who lifted my passport and my money.

1048
01:18:17,156 --> 01:18:20,860
Would your memory become any better if
your passport and money were returned?

1049
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,429
Does that include the $825
Johnson owed me?

1050
01:18:23,529 --> 01:18:26,135
- Why not?
- And the $500 you just mentioned?

1051
01:18:26,599 --> 01:18:28,901
You drive a hard bargain,
Capitaine Morgan.

1052
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:31,837
That's no bargain.
If these people are so important...

1053
01:18:31,937 --> 01:18:35,875
- they're gonna be pretty hard to find.
- Not for a man of your resourcefulness.

1054
01:18:35,975 --> 01:18:38,421
Think it over and let me hear from you.

1055
01:18:50,489 --> 01:18:52,591
- Did you hear all of that?
- Most of it.

1056
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:54,466
Bee lips went away pretty mad.

1057
01:18:54,927 --> 01:18:57,296
When he cools off, though,
he's gonna start thinking.

1058
01:18:57,396 --> 01:18:59,732
He thinks now that you will turn them in.

1059
01:18:59,832 --> 01:19:03,169
- Isn't that what you want him to think?
- What will happen then?

1060
01:19:03,269 --> 01:19:05,638
- He hasn't searched this hotel yet, has he?
- Not yet.

1061
01:19:05,738 --> 01:19:06,772
There's your answer.

1062
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:08,708
He doesn't want them, but the whole setup.

1063
01:19:08,808 --> 01:19:11,210
- What shall we do?
- It's not we, it's you.

1064
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:14,513
You can't do anything until that fella
gets strong enough to move.

1065
01:19:14,613 --> 01:19:16,786
Until then, you're probably safe.

1066
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:18,451
Better get rid of this.

1067
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:20,386
- Bring us some breakfast.
- Sure.

1068
01:19:20,486 --> 01:19:23,389
- I thought you didn't want any breakfast.
- I didn't then.

1069
01:19:23,489 --> 01:19:26,258
- What were you saying, Eddie?
- I've been figuring.

1070
01:19:26,358 --> 01:19:30,465
Them guys don't think that I'm wise,
but they was trying to get me drunk.

1071
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,403
They don't know me, do they, Harry?

1072
01:19:36,268 --> 01:19:38,270
I think they're trying
to find out something.

1073
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:39,438
What do you suppose it is?

1074
01:19:39,538 --> 01:19:41,707
- Don't you know?
- I ain't got no idea.

1075
01:19:41,807 --> 01:19:44,377
That's a good way to leave it.
You got the hiccups.

1076
01:19:44,477 --> 01:19:46,812
Have I, Harry? Yeah, I never noticed.

1077
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:49,715
- You better take a drink of water.
- What, water?

1078
01:19:49,815 --> 01:19:52,618
- That's a good idea, Slim.
- No, not that.

1079
01:19:52,718 --> 01:19:55,028
- It'll do you good.
- I'll be all right.

1080
01:19:56,722 --> 01:19:58,290
- Eddie.
- Yeah, Harry?

1081
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:00,726
Keep out of sight
and stay away from the police.

1082
01:20:00,826 --> 01:20:03,829
They won't believe
that story you told a second time.

1083
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:05,738
What story was that, Harry?

1084
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:08,643
Keep out of sight.

1085
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:06,552
Seen Eddie around?

1086
01:22:06,652 --> 01:22:09,531
No, sir, Mr. Morgan,
I've not seen him all evening.

1087
01:22:09,822 --> 01:22:11,199
Where's Frenchy?

1088
01:22:49,061 --> 01:22:52,167
I'm going to work. Do you like it?

1089
01:22:52,398 --> 01:22:54,733
You won't have to sing much
in that outfit.

1090
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:57,536
- You know, sometimes you make me...
- That's why I do it.

1091
01:22:57,636 --> 01:23:00,673
- Haven't seen Eddie, have you?
- No, not since noon, why?

1092
01:23:00,773 --> 01:23:02,775
He left the boat and hasn't come back.

1093
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:05,253
- Is there anything wrong?
- I don't know.

1094
01:23:05,678 --> 01:23:08,314
Don't look now,
but over there at the second table...

1095
01:23:08,414 --> 01:23:11,417
there's a guy with a mustache.
I think he's following me.

1096
01:23:11,517 --> 01:23:14,396
Keep an eye on him, will you?
I'm going downstairs.

1097
01:23:15,054 --> 01:23:17,289
Stick around awhile, she's going to sing.

1098
01:23:17,389 --> 01:23:19,491
- I'll be right back.
- Give her my love.

1099
01:23:19,591 --> 01:23:21,969
I'd give her my own if she had that on.

1100
01:23:22,428 --> 01:23:25,030
Here's the rest of the lyrics, Slim.
How do you feel?

1101
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:28,043
- I could use a drink, Cricket.
- Sure, come on.

1102
01:23:30,002 --> 01:23:32,710
- What will you have, Slim?
- Scotch and soda.

1103
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:34,276
Same.

1104
01:23:45,217 --> 01:23:47,386
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Capt. Morgan.

1105
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:50,289
- How are you feeling?
- Much better. I'm very grateful to you.

1106
01:23:50,389 --> 01:23:52,892
Forget it. Let me have a look at this.

1107
01:23:55,794 --> 01:23:57,535
- There's no bleeding.
- No.

1108
01:23:59,098 --> 01:24:00,899
- Does that hurt?
- Very little.

1109
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:04,269
My only trouble is when I'm eating.
I'm awkward with my left hand.

1110
01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:08,240
We'll see if we can have you shot
in the other arm next time.

1111
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,217
You won't need me anymore.

1112
01:24:11,643 --> 01:24:12,978
Frenchy, I'm pulling out.

1113
01:24:13,078 --> 01:24:14,446
- When?
- Soon as I find Eddie.

1114
01:24:14,546 --> 01:24:16,081
- Is your friend missing?
- Yeah.

1115
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,149
What happened?

1116
01:24:17,249 --> 01:24:19,585
I don't know,
he left the dock and hasn't been back.

1117
01:24:19,685 --> 01:24:22,588
- Usually does what I tell him.
- I'm sorry if anything happened.

1118
01:24:22,688 --> 01:24:25,691
- I won't know until I find him.
- Couldn't you leave him here?

1119
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:27,593
I don't think Eddie would like that.

1120
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:29,328
Frenchy, as soon as I'm gone...

1121
01:24:29,428 --> 01:24:31,830
Renard will move in
and turn this place upside down...

1122
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:35,134
so you better start figuring
how and where you're gonna move him.

1123
01:24:35,234 --> 01:24:38,771
- Wouldn't it be best if we went with you?
- Why do you want to go?

1124
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:42,708
I'm still trying to get out of the jam
I got into bringing you here.

1125
01:24:42,808 --> 01:24:44,543
Why'd you come here in the first place?

1126
01:24:44,643 --> 01:24:47,546
I know why she came, she told me,
but why did you?

1127
01:24:47,646 --> 01:24:49,515
Have you heard of Pierre Villemars?

1128
01:24:49,615 --> 01:24:53,529
Pierre Villemars? Yeah, I read a headline.
He was quite a guy.

1129
01:24:53,819 --> 01:24:56,055
- Vichy got him. He's dead, isn't he?
- No.

1130
01:24:56,155 --> 01:24:58,924
He's on Devil's Island.
They sent me here to get him...

1131
01:24:59,024 --> 01:25:00,926
to bring him back here to Martinique.

1132
01:25:01,026 --> 01:25:03,929
He's a man whom people
who are persecuted and oppressed...

1133
01:25:04,029 --> 01:25:05,838
will believe in and follow.

1134
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,712
Just how are you gonna get him away?

1135
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:14,106
You don't think much of me, Capt. Morgan.

1136
01:25:14,206 --> 01:25:17,643
You're wondering why they've chosen me
for this mission.

1137
01:25:17,743 --> 01:25:19,154
I wonder, too.

1138
01:25:19,578 --> 01:25:22,218
As you know, I'm not a brave man.

1139
01:25:24,049 --> 01:25:26,586
On the contrary, I'm always frightened.

1140
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,723
I wish I could borrow your nature
for a while, Captain.

1141
01:25:30,823 --> 01:25:33,125
When you meet danger,
you never think of anything...

1142
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:35,364
except how you will circumvent it.

1143
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:39,201
The word failure
does not even exist for you, while I....

1144
01:25:41,466 --> 01:25:44,504
I think always, "Suppose I fail"...

1145
01:25:45,671 --> 01:25:47,412
and then I am frightened.

1146
01:25:47,673 --> 01:25:50,709
Yeah, I can easily see how
it wouldn't take much courage...

1147
01:25:50,809 --> 01:25:53,178
to get a notorious patriot
off Devil's Island.

1148
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:57,850
But just for professional reasons,
I'd like to know how you're gonna do it.

1149
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:59,554
We will find a way.

1150
01:25:59,885 --> 01:26:02,764
It might fail, and if it does...

1151
01:26:02,988 --> 01:26:06,231
and I am still alive...

1152
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:10,932
I will try to pass on my information,
my mission, to someone else.

1153
01:26:11,496 --> 01:26:14,033
Perhaps to a better man,
who does not fail.

1154
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:16,711
Because there is always someone else.

1155
01:26:18,537 --> 01:26:20,806
That is the mistake
the Germans always make...

1156
01:26:20,906 --> 01:26:22,943
with people they try to destroy.

1157
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:26,921
There will be always someone else.

1158
01:26:29,848 --> 01:26:32,451
Originally, we planned
to do everything from here.

1159
01:26:32,551 --> 01:26:35,930
But then, because of my own clumsiness,
it was impossible.

1160
01:26:36,555 --> 01:26:39,126
And that's the reason
we have to go with you.

1161
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:42,427
I couldn't get you on the dock,
there's a man there watching...

1162
01:26:42,527 --> 01:26:44,696
there's one upstairs, they're everywhere.

1163
01:26:44,796 --> 01:26:47,900
- How would I get you through the streets?
- How will you go?

1164
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,668
They're watching me to find you.

1165
01:26:49,768 --> 01:26:53,038
As long as I haven't got you along,
I can at least get on the boat.

1166
01:26:53,138 --> 01:26:55,941
There'll be a fog,
and the tide will turn after midnight.

1167
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:58,410
I can cut loose,
drift out beyond the breakwater...

1168
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,251
before I start my engines.

1169
01:27:01,046 --> 01:27:03,282
I'll still have trouble enough,
even without you.

1170
01:27:03,382 --> 01:27:05,692
- But, Harry...
- Capt. Morgan is right.

1171
01:27:07,419 --> 01:27:09,296
This is not his fight yet.

1172
01:27:10,055 --> 01:27:14,561
Some day I hope it may be,
because we could use him.

1173
01:27:16,094 --> 01:27:17,963
You have done enough for us already.

1174
01:27:18,063 --> 01:27:21,875
Gerard told me of your refusing
Renard's offer to give us up.

1175
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:25,007
How do you know I won't do it yet?

1176
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:27,950
There are many things a man will do...

1177
01:27:28,273 --> 01:27:32,779
but betrayal for a price
is not one of yours.

1178
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:37,057
Good luck.

1179
01:27:38,116 --> 01:27:40,352
- I hope you find your friend.
- Thanks.

1180
01:27:40,452 --> 01:27:42,159
Goodbye, and thanks.

1181
01:27:47,292 --> 01:27:50,295
Frenchy, I got a few things
to talk to you about before I blow.

1182
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,875
Then I'll be up in a little while, Harry.

1183
01:27:57,302 --> 01:27:58,713
Any sign of Eddie?

1184
01:27:59,604 --> 01:28:02,641
- Your friend's still sitting at his table.
- I know.

1185
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:05,410
- What's the matter, Steve?
- I don't know.

1186
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:08,046
I think the whole thing's gonna blow up,
it's too quiet.

1187
01:28:08,146 --> 01:28:10,315
- What will you do?
- We'll leave tonight...

1188
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:12,017
as soon as I find Eddie.

1189
01:28:12,117 --> 01:28:15,394
We're leaving here for good,
the three of us.

1190
01:28:16,321 --> 01:28:18,590
Wait, I want you to know
what you're getting into.

1191
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:20,759
It'll be rough, I'm broke.
If we get out...

1192
01:28:20,859 --> 01:28:23,462
it'll be with a few hundred gallons
of gas and a few francs.

1193
01:28:23,562 --> 01:28:25,864
Just enough to get us
to Port-au-Prince maybe.

1194
01:28:25,964 --> 01:28:27,568
I've never been there.

1195
01:28:28,066 --> 01:28:31,604
I don't know when you'll get back home.
It could be a long time.

1196
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:34,645
It could be forever,
or are you afraid of that?

1197
01:28:35,374 --> 01:28:38,981
I'm hard to get, Steve.
All you have to do is ask me.

1198
01:28:40,278 --> 01:28:42,485
How long will it take you to pack?

1199
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:46,562
There's a lot of people around here,
save it.

1200
01:28:49,588 --> 01:28:52,831
We won't shove off till midnight.
Go ahead and go to work.

1201
01:28:57,696 --> 01:29:00,799
- All set, Slim?
- Sure, but don't make it sad, Cricket.

1202
01:29:00,899 --> 01:29:04,102
- I don't feel that way.
- You don't look that way, either. Let's go.

1203
01:29:04,202 --> 01:29:05,772
Top note, boys.

1204
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:50,742
Madame de Bursac wants to see you.

1205
01:30:50,842 --> 01:30:53,545
- Look, Frenchy, that's all over.
- She's up in your room.

1206
01:30:53,645 --> 01:30:54,846
Why did you....

1207
01:30:54,946 --> 01:30:57,358
Please, Harry, that's all I will ask.

1208
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:00,062
Thanks, Harry.

1209
01:31:04,689 --> 01:31:06,825
You shouldn't have come, it's too risky.

1210
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,093
I told you I can't take you.

1211
01:31:08,193 --> 01:31:11,897
I didn't come up for that.
You've already done too much for us...

1212
01:31:11,997 --> 01:31:14,599
but there's just one other favor
I'd like to ask.

1213
01:31:14,699 --> 01:31:16,501
I want you to take these.

1214
01:31:16,601 --> 01:31:19,271
They were my grandmother's,
and her mother's before that.

1215
01:31:19,371 --> 01:31:23,108
She gave them to me when I got married.
They're all I've got left.

1216
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:26,545
I want you to take them out of here
and save them till we can...

1217
01:31:26,645 --> 01:31:28,547
Suppose they get me before I get out?

1218
01:31:28,647 --> 01:31:31,821
Then throw them overboard,
at least they won't have them.

1219
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,086
Suppose you never come for them?

1220
01:31:34,186 --> 01:31:37,089
Then let it be a part payment
for all you've done for us.

1221
01:31:37,189 --> 01:31:38,600
Please, won't you?

1222
01:31:39,224 --> 01:31:41,893
Steve, Renard just came in,
he's on his way up.

1223
01:31:41,993 --> 01:31:44,132
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.

1224
01:31:45,997 --> 01:31:49,734
All right, you take these,
both of you get in there and keep quiet.

1225
01:31:49,834 --> 01:31:52,370
As soon as I get rid of him,
take her back to the cellar.

1226
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:53,574
All right.

1227
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:05,859
Good evening, may we come in?

1228
01:32:10,822 --> 01:32:12,233
Good evening.

1229
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:14,698
No, I never carry them.

1230
01:32:16,561 --> 01:32:17,596
What's on your mind?

1231
01:32:17,696 --> 01:32:20,232
The whereabouts of the two people
we are searching for.

1232
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:22,000
- You haven't found them yet?
- No.

1233
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:25,737
But since morning, through our sources,
we've learned their names...

1234
01:32:25,837 --> 01:32:29,441
Monsieurand Madame de Bursac.
That is correct, is it not?

1235
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:32,579
- How would I know that?
- I thought perhaps....

1236
01:32:35,247 --> 01:32:36,658
Very nice perfume.

1237
01:32:38,316 --> 01:32:40,353
- You like that?
- Yes.

1238
01:32:41,653 --> 01:32:44,395
So do I. All right, Slim, come out.

1239
01:32:48,426 --> 01:32:51,168
- You've met the boys.
- Good evening.

1240
01:32:51,396 --> 01:32:55,139
Mademoiselle. Now we are all here.

1241
01:32:55,667 --> 01:32:59,877
Except your friend, Mr. Eddie,
as he likes to be called.

1242
01:33:04,609 --> 01:33:06,247
- So you got him.
- Yes.

1243
01:33:06,444 --> 01:33:08,513
Now we lack only the two missing persons.

1244
01:33:08,613 --> 01:33:09,848
What're you gonna do with him?

1245
01:33:09,948 --> 01:33:13,521
If you will not give us
the information we want, perhaps he will.

1246
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:16,555
Before we made the mistake
of giving him liquor...

1247
01:33:16,655 --> 01:33:18,190
this time we will withhold it.

1248
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:20,292
- You know what that'll do to him?
- I think so.

1249
01:33:20,392 --> 01:33:23,795
- He couldn't stand it, he'd crack up.
- You could easily prevent that.

1250
01:33:23,895 --> 01:33:25,306
Yeah, I can.

1251
01:33:26,965 --> 01:33:28,467
You got a cigarette?

1252
01:33:30,268 --> 01:33:33,738
- Can't you make him talk?
- When necessary.

1253
01:33:36,174 --> 01:33:38,484
You'll find some in that drawer, Slim.

1254
01:33:39,844 --> 01:33:44,020
You could save Mr. Eddie a great deal of,
shall we say, discomfort?

1255
01:33:46,785 --> 01:33:50,323
And me a lot of time,
if you will tell us where these people are.

1256
01:33:57,662 --> 01:33:59,497
How much were you going to give me?

1257
01:33:59,597 --> 01:34:01,199
More than what's mine already?

1258
01:34:01,299 --> 01:34:04,906
I do not think now
I will have to pay anybody anything.

1259
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,044
You're probably right.

1260
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:14,587
- I haven't got a match.
- Don't go any....

1261
01:34:16,247 --> 01:34:18,693
All right, go on, get them up. Go on.

1262
01:34:19,551 --> 01:34:21,786
Pull your guns, go ahead.

1263
01:34:21,886 --> 01:34:24,696
Get them out. Go ahead and try it!

1264
01:34:27,258 --> 01:34:29,327
- You're gonna get it, anyway.
- Don't.

1265
01:34:29,427 --> 01:34:31,363
You've been pushing me around long enough.

1266
01:34:31,463 --> 01:34:35,033
You were gonna drive Eddie nuts.
Picking on a poor old rummy that never....

1267
01:34:35,133 --> 01:34:37,841
Slapping girls around.
That's right, go for it!

1268
01:34:38,737 --> 01:34:40,648
Your boy needs company.

1269
01:34:48,279 --> 01:34:51,817
Look at that, ain't that silly?

1270
01:34:54,819 --> 01:34:56,856
That's how close you came.

1271
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:00,563
All right, Frenchy, get their guns.

1272
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:13,449
Here you are.

1273
01:35:19,177 --> 01:35:22,124
Now get over on that couch.
Go ahead, step over him.

1274
01:35:25,884 --> 01:35:27,158
Sit down.

1275
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:32,766
All right, come on out.

1276
01:35:35,727 --> 01:35:38,063
That's one of them,
the other one's in the cellar.

1277
01:35:38,163 --> 01:35:39,698
Take her down, get some help.

1278
01:35:39,798 --> 01:35:42,467
Have them ready to leave on the boat,
then come back here.

1279
01:35:42,567 --> 01:35:44,869
Slim, you pack.
We'll leave as soon as we get Eddie.

1280
01:35:44,969 --> 01:35:46,004
Okay, Steve.

1281
01:35:46,104 --> 01:35:48,106
- Just how do you think you...
- Shut up.

1282
01:35:48,206 --> 01:35:51,119
You want to know
how I'm gonna get him out?

1283
01:35:51,776 --> 01:35:54,045
That broke as easy as you will.

1284
01:35:54,145 --> 01:35:55,580
There's a phone in the hall.

1285
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,249
You're gonna tell someone to let him go,
send him here.

1286
01:35:58,349 --> 01:36:00,351
Yes, you are, one of you.

1287
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,700
I haven't forgotten you.

1288
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:09,194
You'll both take a beating
till someone uses that phone.

1289
01:36:09,294 --> 01:36:11,596
So one of you
is gonna take a beating for nothing.

1290
01:36:11,696 --> 01:36:15,576
I don't care which one it is.
I'll start with you.

1291
01:36:17,669 --> 01:36:20,115
You will release him immediately.

1292
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:25,683
- Tell him you'll explain later.
- I will explain it later.

1293
01:36:26,044 --> 01:36:29,781
Tell him to send him back to the hotel
and do nothing else till you get there.

1294
01:36:29,881 --> 01:36:34,159
Send him back here to the hotel
and do nothing until you hear from us.

1295
01:36:37,889 --> 01:36:41,268
All right, inside.
You've got some harbor passes to fill out.

1296
01:36:44,462 --> 01:36:46,942
And now Paul and Madame de Bursac.

1297
01:36:50,368 --> 01:36:52,405
I'll be right with you, Frenchy.

1298
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:05,017
- They're all yours now.
- Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

1299
01:37:06,251 --> 01:37:07,485
They are all ready.

1300
01:37:07,585 --> 01:37:09,721
These will get them past the guard
and on the boat.

1301
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:11,389
Where will you take them?

1302
01:37:11,489 --> 01:37:13,158
- Maybe Devil's Island.
- What?

1303
01:37:13,258 --> 01:37:15,894
Might even get Villemars off,
wasn't that what you wanted?

1304
01:37:15,994 --> 01:37:19,203
Very much. Why are you doing this, Harry?

1305
01:37:20,832 --> 01:37:22,311
I don't know.

1306
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,937
Maybe because I like you,
maybe because I don't like them.

1307
01:37:26,037 --> 01:37:28,506
I'm glad you are on our side, Harry.

1308
01:37:28,606 --> 01:37:30,381
No kissing, Frenchy.

1309
01:37:31,209 --> 01:37:34,846
- You'll have to take care of those guys.
- We will give you plenty of time.

1310
01:37:34,946 --> 01:37:37,682
If you let them go,
they'll come back and burn this place.

1311
01:37:37,782 --> 01:37:39,884
Let them, it will be a very small fire.

1312
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:44,122
When Villemars comes back,
it'll be our turn. We'll start a bigger one.

1313
01:37:44,222 --> 01:37:45,758
Meet you on the boat.

1314
01:37:46,891 --> 01:37:48,460
One minute, please.

1315
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,699
That's all right, let him through.

1316
01:37:54,032 --> 01:37:56,935
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- It's all right now.

1317
01:37:57,035 --> 01:37:59,743
You look glad to see me.
You know a funny thing...

1318
01:38:00,238 --> 01:38:02,740
Don't know what they wanted,
but they wouldn't give me...

1319
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:05,944
I'll get you one down on the boat.
We're leaving, Eddie.

1320
01:38:06,044 --> 01:38:07,812
- Ready, Slim?
- In a minute, Steve.

1321
01:38:07,912 --> 01:38:09,347
Close that, will you?

1322
01:38:09,447 --> 01:38:12,884
- Say, what is this, is she going with us?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

1323
01:38:12,984 --> 01:38:15,157
Harry, you mean.... What's she got....

1324
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:19,031
- Who are you?
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

1325
01:38:20,325 --> 01:38:21,559
- Was you?
- Yeah.

1326
01:38:21,659 --> 01:38:23,495
You got to be careful of dead bees.

1327
01:38:23,595 --> 01:38:25,597
They can sting you just as bad
as live ones.

1328
01:38:25,697 --> 01:38:28,433
Especially if they was kind of mad
when they got killed.

1329
01:38:28,533 --> 01:38:30,368
I feel like I was talking to myself.

1330
01:38:30,468 --> 01:38:33,039
I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.

1331
01:38:34,005 --> 01:38:37,919
- Why don't you bite them back?
- I would. Only I haven't got a stinger.

1332
01:38:39,877 --> 01:38:43,448
I remember you. You're all right.
She can come, it's okay with me.

1333
01:38:43,548 --> 01:38:45,250
I'll have both of you to take care of.

1334
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:48,386
That's right, Eddie.
You can begin by grabbing these bags.

1335
01:38:48,486 --> 01:38:49,988
Come on, Slim.

1336
01:39:08,906 --> 01:39:11,209
Do I have time to say goodbye to Cricket?

1337
01:39:11,309 --> 01:39:12,754
Sure, go ahead.

1338
01:39:20,952 --> 01:39:22,520
- I came to say goodbye.
- What?

1339
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:25,323
We're leaving now. Thanks for everything.

1340
01:39:25,423 --> 01:39:28,836
- Hey, Slim. Are you still happy?
- What do you think?
