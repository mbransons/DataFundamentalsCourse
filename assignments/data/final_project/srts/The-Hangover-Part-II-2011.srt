Daddy, please! You're not helping!

17
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,070
I looked into his eyes.
Not the eyes of a man.

18
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,510
The eyes of a coward.

- Bill!
- Tracy!

22
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,510
- I'm sorry!
- Where the hell are you?

23
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,070
It happened again!

24
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,710
Don't say that, please!

25
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,150
No this time we really fucked up.

26
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,910
Seriously! What is wrong with you three?

27
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,950
So much Trace, I don't even know
where to begin.

28
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,470
<i>Oh god! How bad?</i>

29
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,990
- Like, no wedding bad?
- Yeah...

30
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,590
a little worse than that.

THE HANGOVER PART II

32
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,350
ONE WEEK EARLIER

33
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,990
Uh, huh.

34
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,910
- You really need to floss more.
- Fuck that! That's why I come here.

35
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,110
- Then you should come more than once every two years!
- Why? So you can bleed me of all my money?

36
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,630
I never charge you a dime, Phil!

37
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,630
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous?
- Ah, you don't actually.

38
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,230
Come on! Just one hit!

39
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,790
Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?

40
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,950
Yeah, actually. You're getting married
in Thailand.

41
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,630
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph.
That's two grand right there.

42
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,590
Then my mother in laws watching the kids. So
now she's got this whole new thing over my head.

43
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,630
Plus, takes five days to get there.

44
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,110
It's a 16 hour flight. And it's beautiful
when you get there.

45
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,510
- Whatever, it's a hassle!
- It is kinda far.

46
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,950
Lauren's been there a week and she's
still jet lagged.

47
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,550
But it's where her parents are from and
it means a lot to them.

48
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,870
Who gives a shit about her parents!
Her dad hates you!

49
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,470
He doesn't hate me! He's just never
spoken to me...

50
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,030
...I think it's a cultural thing.

51
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,790
Why can't you just get married in Vegas like
you did the last time. It's so much easier.

52
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,550
Why can't you just be excited for me?

53
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,830
This is my wedding!

54
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,350
- You're really happy, huh?
- I really am.

55
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,630
Alright...

56
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,270
...I'm happy too.

57
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,950
- Thank you!
- Gonna be fun.

58
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,270
Phil. Put the prescription pad back.

59
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,390
- Thank you. You know that's a felony right?
- Fuck you, man!

60
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,550
- Was this right up against your scrotum?
- Yep.

61
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,430
- Oh my god, I just realized.
- What?

62
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,550
- I forgot to renew my passport!
- Oh no...

63
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,550
Good thing I did it last week. It's in
the kitchen drawer.

64
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,710
- You're the best!
- Hey! We're a team!

65
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,150
You're a good guy. Like a really good guy!

66
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,630
Thank you!

67
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,870
- So I know you're not gonna get mad.
- Mad? What, mad at what?

68
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,310
Alan found out that we're going to
Thailand for Stu's wedding.

69
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,790
- So?
- So he's heart broken Doug. You guys are like his family!

70
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,710
No. Your family is like his family.

71
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,750
All Alan talks about is the three of you.

72
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,750
- And that weekend.
- Wait a second...

73
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,070
- Is he the one who keeps calling and hanging up?
- He does that when he's upset.

74
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,630
He doesn't understand why he's not invited.

75
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,150
Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.

76
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,230
For me...

77
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,310
No fucking way! Absolutely not!

78
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,230
Come on Stu, it's killing him.

79
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,110
Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.

80
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,910
I get it. I really do. It's just, you know what...

81
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,070
Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.

82
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,910
I consider Alan to be insane.

83
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,270
Stu, throw him a bone! We've already said he's got to
pay for everything he eats and everything he breaks.

84
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,310
You know what. We should see if we can squeeze
the old man to cover the bachelor party.

85
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,390
- That's good.
- I'm glad you brought that up.

86
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,790
- Because... this is the bachelor party!
- What?

87
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,870
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, it's my bachelor brunch!

88
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,030
Go crazy. Get some chocolate chip pancakes... a
lap dance from the waitress...

89
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,670
That's bullshit! You can't just skip
out of a bachelor party, Stu.

90
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,350
You see that? That's orange juice with
a napkin on top.

91
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,030
Do you know why? So nobody will refuse me.

92
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,870
Why I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe
at a bachelor party?

93
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,710
- C'mon Stu. Don't you think you're over reacting?
- No, I don't.

94
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,310
I'm still putting the pieces of my broken
psyche back together.

95
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,950
And you know what the glue is? Lauren!
I'm not doing anything to screw that up.

96
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,110
- Oh, please. You wouldn't even be with her if it wasn't for us.
- Oh, this'll be good.

97
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,750
Stu, think about it!

98
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,790
You ended up ditching Melissa, and two years later
you met your true soul mate.

99
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,990
You take Vegas out of that equation, you
would have married a cunt.

100
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,990
Oh that's ok. I'm allowed to say it. It's
a bachelor party.

101
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,510
Drink up everybody.

102
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,390
Oh wait, there's no alcohol! I forgot
we're at a fuckin IHOP!

103
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,550
Well it's my decision and it's final, so...
how bout a toast?

104
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,910
This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.

105
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,390
- C'mon Phil, where you going?
- Doug, Doug, I just don't get it!

106
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,390
He's getting married in Thailand! That's
great for him, but what about us?

107
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,950
You're selfish! Come on, sweetheart...

108
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,750
Shame on you!

109
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,910
Don't worry Stu. I will stand up for you
no matter what.

110
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,110
Thank you.

111
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,390
But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing.

112
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,670
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means...

113
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,110
Alan's been waiting for the invite ever
since he got word of the wedding.

114
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,470
- I'm sure he has.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,590
Been standing outside by the mailbox every day.

116
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,110
- Well that's tough.
- Yeah.

117
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,590
I uh, I'm not sure he ever left Vegas.

118
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,910
He really needs this.

119
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,310
What?

120
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,830
Sweetie, papa! You have visitors!
Go in slowly.

121
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,550
Give him a chance to acclimate.

122
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,310
- Hey, Alan!
- Hey, guys! Hey, Phil!

123
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,150
Hey, bud!

124
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,110
- You guys wanna come in?
- Sure. Absolutely.

125
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,350
- Hey.
- Hey.

126
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,790
- Hey, Stu!
- Ok. See you on the court in half...

127
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,670
- Pretty cool room, Alan!
- Thanks, Phil! My dad pays my rent.

128
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,310
Alan, what the fuck! You were supposed
to delete these!

129
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,150
You made a promise!

130
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

131
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,750
What the hell? I'm not cool with this
at all. You can't have these.

132
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,550
Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.

133
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,950
- A total violation of trust!
- Mother I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here!

134
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,710
<i>I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.</i>

135
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,630
- I can't believe you guys stopped by. This is really cool.
- Wait a second!

136
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,110
- Al, is that Mr. Chow?
- Yeah. We still keep in touch.

137
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,150
Stu!

138
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,550
Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?

139
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,470
He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.

140
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,990
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.

141
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,390
He's actually quite charming.

142
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,430
- Alan, he's a criminal.
- Excuse me, boys!

143
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,230
- Hi, Linda!
- Hi, Dougie!

144
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,550
I guess we don't do desert anymore. I
didn't get that memo.

145
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,550
I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

146
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,950
Would a cupcake kill you?

147
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,950
- You know, I don't think this was a good idea.
- Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

148
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,910
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

149
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,710
- Well only if you're not busy.
- Stu!

150
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,190
Well maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.

151
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,950
Nope. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend.

152
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,990
Are you really being serious, Stu?
You're inviting me?

153
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,030
Yeah why not? It's gonna be fun, right?

154
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,430
- Phil, are you going?
- Of course!

155
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,270
Then it will be fun.

156
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,630
What the fuck are you doing, man?

157
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,230
It's my immunizations. It's the last day
I can do it.

158
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,510
That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

159
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,150
I'm a nurse. Just not registered.

160
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,630
Stu, look at this!
I bought this cause I thought of you!

161
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,670
- Hey, there he is!
- Hey, Stu!

162
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,910
- Teddy! What's up? How are ya?
- Hey Stu.

163
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,270
- Alright. Who's this guy, Stu?
- This is Teddy. Lauren's little brother.

164
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,190
Goes to Stanford. Pre-med. This is
Phil, Alan and Doug.

165
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,550
Hey, nice to meet you, man!

166
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,710
Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

167
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,070
- He's 17. Kind of a genius.
- Actually, I'm 16.

168
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,470
I'm not a genius. My dad just had me take
the entrance exams early.

169
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,750
Because you're a genius.

170
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,870
- So what are you, a doctor?
- No, not yet. I'm premed.

171
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,230
- Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?
- Yeah.

172
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,590
- Well, he turned out to be a gay.
- Alan.

173
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,550
It's true, I read it in Teen People.

174
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,870
Right, ok... well I'm gonna grab a book or something
for the plane. You guys want anything?

175
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,110
- No, thanks. I'm good.
- I would actually love a small water.

176
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,470
Cool.

177
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,390
- What's the matter with you. He's 16 years old.
- Yeah, Alan. Take it easy!

178
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,470
I'm a little confused. Is he here just to
see us off or what. How does this work?

179
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,070
- How does what work?
- Is that person coming to the wedding?

180
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,630
Yes Alan. My brides little brother is
coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?

181
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,110
Well, it's the first time I've heard of it.
You could have paged me.

182
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,830
Don't over react. It's gonna be fine.

183
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,230
- Hey. Mind if I sit?
- Wolf pack only. Find another chair.

184
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,230
- There's no wolfpack, Alan. C'mon.
- It's no problem. I'll find...

185
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,550
- Teddy, don't be ridiculous! You're sitting here!
- Careful, that's a Louis...

186
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,510
That is a Louis Vuitton!

187
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,750
- That's a nice neck roll!
- Thanks! You can use it if you want.

188
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,350
Ok.

189
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,310
<i>The Downeaster 'Alexa'" by Billy Joel playing</i>

190
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,590
Baby!

191
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,510
This is so absolutely beautiful!
Thank you much!

192
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,830
Of course.

193
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,590
Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited.
Pretty soon you'll have 2 doctors in the family.

194
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,070
You have to realize that in my country we
don't consider dentists to be real doctors.

195
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,110
Dad...

196
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,710
Ok.

197
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,630
Anyway I have to go and talk to Teddy
about his cello performance tonight.

198
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,510
Ouch!

199
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,190
I'm so sorry...

200
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,870
Your dad's kind of obsessed with your
brother, isn't he?

201
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,470
Teddy is my dad's prize possession. It's
always been that way.

202
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,470
He'll warm up, I promise! Okay?

203
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,550
You can just fax it over to me. I'll
pick it up at the concierge.

204
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,510
Thanks, papa! Bye bye!

205
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,510
That was my dad. I'm a stay at home son.

206
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,070
We were discussing your wedding gift.
He's sparing no expense.

207
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,710
Oh... That's so unnecessary.

208
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,550
I've been meaning to ask someone. I
notice this is a fishing village.

209
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,550
Is there a Long John Silver's on
the island?

210
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,470
You know. No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.

211
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,310
But, we are actually serving some
great fresh seafood.

212
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,910
- Better than Long John's?
- Yes.

213
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,030
- I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening.
- You too. Ok.

214
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,870
All right!

215
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,830
Thank you, Teddy!

216
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,870
The hands of a brilliant musician!

217
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,510
And one day, a great surgeon.

218
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,630
I admit it...

219
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,510
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

220
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,830
He seemed unattractive. He lacked
intelligence and imagination.

221
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,270
He was missing the spark you look for
in a man.

222
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,310
But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

223
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,870
It reminded me of my sweet brother,
Chai Yo.

224
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,870
For those who do not know, Chai Yo is learning
the sailboat and lives in a group home.

225
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,070
But Chai Yo loves "khao" .

226
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:51,750
And that's when I realized, Stu is "khao".

227
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,430
What is "khao"?

228
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,310
"Khao" is soft white rice in luke warm water.

229
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,590
It has no taste.

230
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,670
We feed it to small baby and uh, very
old people.

231
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,910
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

232
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:14,870
The world needs "khao", just as the
world needs people like Stu.

233
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,070
To my sweet daughter and Stu!
Congratulations!

234
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,550
Cheers!

235
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,950
And now I believe that Teddy has
something to say.

236
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,990
Sit down! I got this.
Sit down, boy!

237
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,470
That was a.. a great speech, sir!

238
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,990
I like the comparison between
Stu and rice.

239
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,510
I've also prepared a few words.

240
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,270
Hey everybody. Here's some fun facts.

241
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,750
The population in Thailand is 63 million people.

242
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,390
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

243
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,150
It's chief exports are textiles, footwear
and rice.

244
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,990
Each year approximately 13,000 people are
killed in car accidents in Thailand.

245
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,950
- The climate in Thailand...
- Alan!

246
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,790
- Why don't you skip to the last card there, buddy.
- Okay. Sorry!

247
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,470
None of you know Stu like I do.

248
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,070
Not you... not you... not you...

249
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,790
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

250
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,830
No one!

251
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,470
I can't even tell you what we've been
through cause we made a pact.

252
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,830
More important than blood.

253
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,870
What I can tell you is this. This is
not Stu's first marriage.

254
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,110
There was a whore in Las Vegas
a couple of years ago.

255
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,950
Sit down...

256
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,590
- Enough! He'll get over it!
- Okay. Thanks, Phil!

257
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,030
In your face!

258
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,470
Well that was exactly as painful as I
expected it to be.

259
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,910
Sorry...

260
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,790
- Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing?
- HaHa. Very funny!

261
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,230
Be nice, Phil! He's extra sensitive tonight.

262
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,390
Get over it! He's your father in law. He's
supposed to hate you.

263
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,950
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

264
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,590
You know... I'm really exhausted. We're
just gonna go upstairs and crash.

265
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,830
C'mon, I just spoke with the manager. He's
gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.

266
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,590
That sounds fun!

267
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,750
- Nyah... I'm good.
- He's tired!

268
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,790
Stu, one drink with your friends who
came all this way.

269
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,870
- I just wanna hang out with you!
- Oh c'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.

270
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,030
Take Teddy with you. He never gets to
have any fun.

271
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,550
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

272
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,350
- Alright. One drink!
- Perfect.

273
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,270
- See you later.
- Have fun!

274
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,310
- You have the key?
- Yep, got it right here!

275
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,710
I'll see you in 20 minutes!

276
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,830
My uncle Roger said that he once saw
an albino polar bear.

277
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,470
Really? Polar bears are white.
How would he know if it's an albino?

278
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,510
This one was black.

279
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,550
Did you ever think maybe it was
just a black bear?

280
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,910
Whatever...

281
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,230
Ok. Here we go. American beer.

282
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,310
- Sealed bottle!
- Thank you. Alright!

283
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,910
- I'm not really old enough to drink.
- Yeah, it's illegal.

284
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,310
Would be a shame if somebody reported you.

285
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,510
Nobody's reporting anybody.
It's fine Teddy. Have a little fun.

286
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,870
Careful!

287
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,790
What is this? Instant marshmallows?
Nice touch!

288
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,870
- That was Alan's idea.
- Good thinking, Al!

289
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,470
You know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu!
This place is paradise.

290
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,710
Not bad, right?

291
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,270
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm actually jealous of you.

292
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,670
- I mean, Lauren is an angel.
- Yeah, she really is amazing.

293
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,110
Wow, you guys are sweet.

294
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,310
Not big breasts on her. But still, solid
rack for an Asian.

295
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,230
- Sorry, Teddy, but it's true.
- That's ok.

296
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,390
That is just wildly inappropriate.

297
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:26,310
And yet... I'm really glad you're here.
All you guys. Even you Alan.

298
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,550
It means a lot that you made the trip.
Thank you.

299
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,110
- Wouldn't have missed it buddy.
- Great!

300
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,470
Now. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?

301
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,630
Alright. Toast! C'mon stand up guys.

302
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,070
Come over here, Alan!

303
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,230
To Lauren and Stu!

304
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,070
- You did it, buddy.
- Sure did.

305
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,190
Cheers!

306
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,310
What the hell...

307
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,430
What?

308
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,670
Phil...

309
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,310
I think it happened again.

310
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,310
- Alan, what the fuck did you do?
- I didn't do anything. I swear to god.

311
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,670
Your hair is gone.

312
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,150
No, no... up.

313
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,710
Where the fuck are we?

314
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,710
Phil, I'm scared.

315
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,510
Stu, c'mon get up! We got a situation.

316
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,790
- Oh, holy shit!
- Where are we?

317
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:19,310
- Oh my god, Alan. Your head.
- No your head!

318
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,350
- Is it bald?
- Stu, you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be ok.

319
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,110
- Why? Was it my teeth?
- Nope, it's not your teeth.

320
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,630
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

321
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,390
Can you see the bottom?

322
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,030
Oh my god! What the fu...ck

323
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,230
That's good. Why don't you try to wash it off.

324
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,590
It's not coming off. This is a real tattoo!

325
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,790
- Alan, what did you do! Did you Roofie me?
- I didn't do anything!

326
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,190
Stu, he swore to god!

327
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,030
What happened?

328
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,350
Get it off of me!

329
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,430
- What the hell?
- It's a monkey.

330
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,030
What a cute little mask. Hi little monkey.

331
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,430
Alan...

332
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:19,310
Phone! Alan, go find the phone!

333
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,590
I got it!

334
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,750
- Doug, where the hell are you?
- I'm at breakfast. By the pool.

335
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,830
- You guys coming down or what?
- Oh Jesus. Thank god. Doug's fine.

336
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,870
- Stu, Doug's fine. He's at the resort.
- Why aren't we at the resort.

337
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,430
What's going on? Where are you guys?

338
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,350
I do not know, man! We woke up
in some shit hole room in some city.

339
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,870
- Oh god. What city?
- I don't know, Doug!

340
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,510
Fuckin Asia-town.

341
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,550
<i>- I do not know, I told you.
- Where are we?</i>

342
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,310
- Hey Stu.
- What?

343
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,790
Check this out.

344
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,390
Ever seen anything like this?

345
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,350
- What is that?
- Careful. Might be a spiders nest.

346
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,870
I've tangled with those before.

347
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,870
I don't get it man. We each had one beer
last night, right? I mean you too!

348
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,390
- Yeah but I left early, remember?
- I don't remember shit!

349
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,310
Tracy wasn't feeling well. She came
down to get me.

350
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,350
- Wait and second. Is Teddy with you guys?
- Teddy? What? What are you talking about?

351
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,030
He wasn't in his room. They've been
looking for him all morning.

352
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,910
- Teddy went to Stanford, right?
- Yeah. Why?

353
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,750
Fuck!

354
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,230
- I just found his finger!
- What?

355
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,630
- I just found his fucking finger, Doug!
- Phil, what is going on?

356
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,830
Alright. Alright, alright... this is
what we're gonna do.

357
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,030
You tell the girls that we woke up early and went
on a fishing trip, ok. And that's where we are.

358
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,070
- Right.
- Right, stay by the phone!

359
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,110
Shit!

360
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,550
Uh, we got a little bit of a problem.

361
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,270
What is that?

362
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,630
We don't know.

363
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,670
- Is it a worm?
- It's a mushroom.

364
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,070
Yeah, shiitake.

365
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,590
Monkey, taste it! Is it shiitake?

366
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,990
- He can't understand you.
- He just did.

367
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,270
- Why is he pulling on it?
- He's probably hungry.

368
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,750
Wait a second. Is that...

369
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,590
What the fuck man. Tell that gay monkey
to leave my shit alone.

370
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,910
Chow?

371
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,790
You're fucking crazy.

372
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:48,510
It's so fucking light in here!
Alan, grab me my sunglasses!

373
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:53,390
- It's great to see you, Leslie!
- Nice to see you too my little popo.

374
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,310
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

375
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,790
Alan called me a few days ago and
invited me to the wedding.

376
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,990
- Excuse me?
- What, he's my plus one.

377
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,590
You don't have plus one. It's $200 a plate.

378
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,630
Guys, guys. Just focus, ok.
Chow, what happened?

379
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,110
You guys texted me, said you're fucked
up and looking to party.

380
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,190
I picked you up on my boat and I brought
you here to Bangkok.

381
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,790
But we had a sick night, bitches!

382
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:27,710
Wait a second Chow,  we're in Bangkok?

383
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,910
Holler, city of squalor.

384
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,590
- Do you know how I got this tattoo?
- Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!

385
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,630
Come on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.

386
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,630
What's the monkey holding?

387
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,990
- That's a finger!
- Stu, I got some bad news.

388
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:51,430
Teddy was with us last night.
That's his finger.

389
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,910
- Teddy's dead?
- Teddy's not dead! He partied with us all night!

390
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,550
- Well then where is he?
- Don't you remember anything?

391
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,830
- No!
- No, nothing, Chow.

392
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,910
Ok I explain it all, ok?

393
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,750
Just let me do one bump, get my head straight.
Come to papa.

394
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,150
That's a big...

395
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:24,230
You ready for craziest fucking story ever...

396
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,030
Chow!

397
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,070
Hey Chow, you okay?

398
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,230
You gotta be kidding me.

399
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,630
Fuck, he's dead!

400
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,270
- Help!
- Stu!

401
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,190
- Help!
- Stu, shut up!

402
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,990
- Call an ambulance!
- Shut up! He's dead!

403
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,790
Look if someone comes and finds a dead
body and a pile of cocaine...

404
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,190
We're gonna spend the rest of our fucking
lives in a Thai prison.

405
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,470
Alan! Please don't cry!

406
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,550
Alright. Alright. I just need a second to
figure this out.

407
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,110
ICE MACHINE LOCATED ON 15TH FLOOR.

408
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,790
Look, this is the worst idea, ever.

409
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,590
What the fuck is this place?

410
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,230
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand. Its
population is 12 million people...

411
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,870
Alan, will you help!

412
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,750
- The elevator!
- I'll get the button!

413
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,190
- What the fuck is the deal with this monkey?
- That monkey gets it!

414
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,150
- Come on!
- Fuck no!

415
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:24,070
The powers out. We gotta take the stairs.

416
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,430
- Oh fuck!
- Come on!

417
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,430
Here it is!

418
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,270
Feet first. I've done this before.

419
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,350
Careful!

420
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,550
- Stu!
- What?

421
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,230
- We still have to find Teddy!
- Oh god.

422
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,710
The roof!

423
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:23,670
Teddy!

424
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,750
- You guys see him?
- No!

425
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,910
He's not here.

426
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,510
I can't believe this is happening again.

427
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,670
Ok, look. We'll handle this. You get
back there.

428
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,110
You tell them that Alan and I got drunk
with him, we're still partying.

429
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:04,070
- You gotta go get married!
- No! Not going back without Teddy!

430
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,990
He's Lauren's little brother. He's lost,
he's injured.

431
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:14,350
If I fuck this up, I lose everything.

432
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,230
Ok.

433
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,750
Alright.

434
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,950
- Alan, check your pockets!
- What?

435
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,750
You know the drill. C'mon there might
be clues.

436
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,470
- Check your phones! Numbers, texts.
- That's a good idea!

437
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,430
- I got nothing. Fuck!
- I got an text from Chow.

438
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,150
- What time?
- Uh, 10 o'clock last night.

439
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:41,270
- What's it say?
- "On my way, Niggahs"

440
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,390
Oh, Niggahs... ok... hip hop.

441
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,070
We are so... fucked!

442
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:56,150
Hey Phil! Look who's back!

443
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,350
We gotta get you out of the sun. You're
too hot.

444
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,550
Phil, I really think we should go to
the American Consulate.

445
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,870
For what? To report a dead body we shoved
into an ice machine?

446
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,030
What are we gonna do? Keep walking around
in circles? Cause that's real productive.

447
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,550
You know I'm trying to figure this thing
out here and your attitude is not helping.

448
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,630
I'm sorry. It's a 100 degrees and we
don't have a plan.

449
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,910
And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas.

450
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,630
-What, it's a bag of Fanta!
- Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?

451
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,670
I don't know!

452
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,630
Well then stop yelling at me like it's my fuckin fault.

453
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,150
It is your fault!

454
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,470
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

455
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,670
Shit! Shut up! It's Doug! Talk to me!

456
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,150
I just got off the phone with Bangkok PD.
They've got him. He's ok.

457
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,230
Oh thank god! Doug found him.

458
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,990
- What happened?
- He got arrested.

459
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,670
- Arrested? For what?
- Disorderly conduct.

460
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,830
- Seriously?
- Yeah! He's ok though.

461
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,310
They'll release him to you. No questions
asked. No one has to know.

462
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:54,030
He's at the Ratra Wang police station.

463
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,150
Ok. I'll call you when we get there.

464
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,550
Teddy's in jail, but he's fine. We
gotta get a cab.

465
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,590
- Ok!
- Alright!

466
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,470
- Yes, I have his paperwork here.
- Okay.

467
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,350
- He has been treated.
- Sounds good.

468
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,630
We're good. They've processed him for
release.

469
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,910
They put him in the drunk tank. He's fine.

470
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,630
Sixteen years old and spent a night in
jail. Can you imagine?

471
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,910
Haha! We love to party.

472
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,950
Here we go!

473
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,710
- Wait who's this fuckin guy?
- Teddy Sisay.

474
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,910
No, no, no, no. That's the wrong guy! Sir!

475
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,430
Excuse me.. I'm sorry. Officer. You brought
the wrong guy. That's not Teddy!

476
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,350
Of course it is!
We have his ID's and everything!

477
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,350
These were in his pocket
when we made the arrest.

478
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,310
They were in his pocket?

479
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:54,150
Excuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?

480
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,470
Hello?

481
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,750
Teddy doesn't speak. We tried English,
Thai, Chinese... Nothing.

482
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,470
Let me ask you something.

483
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:08,190
Does he look like he works out at Bally
Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

484
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:14,430
Look. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot
analyze everything.

485
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,550
- What do you expect us to do with this guy?
- Not my problem!

486
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:25,150
Hey guys, I think he knows us. Hi. Hello.

487
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:32,110
You know where our friend is, Teddy?
He's missing!

488
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,750
- Stu, forget it. The guys worthless.
- He knows something!

489
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,590
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

490
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:44,430
Maybe he just doesn't understand. I'll
act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.

491
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,910
- Two words.
- Is it a movie?

492
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,510
This is not for you, Alan!

493
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:56,990
- American teenager... in Asia.
- Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.

494
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,670
It's easy cause you're talking to him.

495
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,310
Stu, it's a waste of time! Just leave
this fucking guy here.

496
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:07,190
Here's something. There are 500 thousand
monks living in Thailand.

497
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:13,470
It is not uncommon for some monks to take
a vow of silence, at the age of eight.

498
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,550
There you go.

499
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,270
- Anything else in that envelope?
- Nah, it's empty.

500
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:23,830
Woah, hang on. A drink card from White
Lion bar in Bangkok?

501
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,910
Worth a shot.

502
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,350
Jesus christ! Is this the right street?

503
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,710
That's what it says.

504
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:44,190
- Whoa! This is the White Lion!
- What the fuck happened here?

505
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,710
Holy shit!

506
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,710
<i>(yelling in Thai)</i>

507
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,790
- Let's...
- We should probably...

508
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,630
That's ok.

509
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,750
What the fuck is going on here?

510
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:09,230
- Whoa, guys. Check it out!
- Holy shit! Stu, look!

511
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:15,230
That's my face. Go, go go!
Nice work, Alan!

512
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,750
- Hello?
- Be with you in a minute!

513
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,470
- Excuse me.
- Oh, look who it is!

514
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,150
- So what do ya think?
- What, I'm sorry?

515
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:35,390
- The tattoo. You love it?
- Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

516
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,190
- No refunds. Get the fuck out!
- Wait a second!

517
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,750
Read the sign!

518
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,270
NO REFUNDS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

519
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,870
We don't want any refunds. We just have
a couple of questions.

520
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,910
We're trying to figure out what went
down last night.

521
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,510
What went down? Take a look at what you
did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.

522
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,350
- We did that?
- You don't remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?

523
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:59,630
- Starting a full on fuckin riot?
- Sir, we don't remember anything.

524
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,670
Oh boy...

525
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,350
Check this out!

526
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,710
Oh shit!

527
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,150
<i>Fuck the Police!</i>

528
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,950
There's Teddy! He was with us!

529
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,310
Jesus christ!

530
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:45,030
That's when the cops arrived and started
cracking skulls.

531
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,830
I took you guys and hid you in the
shop here.

532
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:52,070
Then you decided to get a tattoo.
You cried like a little bitch.

533
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,270
This kid is fucking nine years old. He's
got balls twice your size.

534
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,990
- Show him your balls, Nao!
- No, no, no. That's ok.

535
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,550
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy.
Have you seen him?

536
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,670
Not since last night. Why? What happened?

537
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,270
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister
tomorrow and we kinda lost him.

538
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,670
- Oh well. Then fuck it!
- What do you mean, fuck it?

539
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,190
Bangkok has him now and she'll never
let him go.

540
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,310
- You hear that, huh? Is this what you
wanted? You happy now?

541
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,750
You're wasting your time. These monks
take their vow shit seriously.

542
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:29,830
Look at this. That's the sign of the Chang
Mai Monastery, just outside of town.

543
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,990
Maybe somebody over there can get him
to talk.

544
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,990
- Ok, can we just go over this one
more time? You got the beer from...

545
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,990
- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case.
- Right.

546
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,550
- But, who gave it to you?
- The bartender.

547
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,710
And then you brought em out and
I  opened them.

548
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,190
Yeah and Doug had one and he was fine
so it's not the beer.

549
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,590
- So what the hell happened?
- I have no idea!

550
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,910
Hey guys. Check it out. He's got a
Chinese boner.

551
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,070
Alan, come on! Cut it out!

552
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:08,630
- That is so wrong!
- Don't stop monkey, keep doing it.

553
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:23,110
When a monkey nibbles on a penis
it's funny in any language!

554
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,350
Keep doing it!

555
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,430
Alright, thank you!

556
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,910
Bye Shannon! Bye Little Wayne!

557
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,150
Wow! So beautiful!

558
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,790
What is this, a PF Chang's?

559
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,870
Ah, they're meditating.

560
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,070
- Such a peaceful people!
- Yeah.

561
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,870
- Knock, knock! Hello!
- Alan! Show some respect!

562
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,910
- Don't get up guys.
- We brought one of your guys back.

563
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,750
He's really funny. He's really nice
and cool.

564
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,190
Hi, how you doing. You the one in charge?

565
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,630
- Excuse me... ow... Wait!
- Stop it! Calm down!

566
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,550
Hold on. It's because we're talking.

567
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,270
God damn it! Oh! Stop!

568
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,190
Wait it's me!

569
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,990
Oh I get it.

570
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,670
No talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...

571
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,390
Ok.

572
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,710
Late last night, you climbed the walls
of our monastery.

573
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:16,550
Shouting out questions about love, marriage
and the meaning of life.

574
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,430
Poor brother Han was meditating alone
in the garden.

575
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,590
- And you took him.
- Oh my god!

576
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,350
- We kidnapped a monk.
- We live an alternative life style.

577
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:34,510
We are so sorry about that, but we weren't
ourselves last night.

578
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:40,550
Yep, things kinda spun outta control a little
bit. But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

579
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,710
Can you find out if he knows where our
friend is?

580
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,030
Brother Han took a vow of silence many
years ago.

581
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,110
It would be useless to try.

582
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,190
Well maybe he can write down what happened,
on a piece of paper?

583
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,230
Actually Phil, that would be cheating.
Isn't that right, Grand Wizard.

584
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,150
- Alan!
- I'm afraid fatty is right.

585
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,070
See?... What?

586
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,910
None of us will ever know what brother
Han knows.

587
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:09,150
Oh, alright. Well, so much for holy people.
Bunch of bald assholes. C'mon, let's go.

588
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,190
Hey you know what! FYI! You may want to
put some signs up that say no talking...

589
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,430
- ...before you unleash your dragon.
- Yeah, that was a little rough.

590
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,510
And "your welcome" for bringing him
back safe.

591
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,350
- You know we found him in the drunk tank.
- Yeah well we did take him in the first place.

592
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,110
- C'mon guys, let's go.
- Wait!

593
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:31,590
The Buddha teach, every memory lives
somewhere deep within.

594
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:36,310
Perhaps you should bring your question
to the Garden of Meditation.

595
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:39,390
- Did you understand a word he just said?
- Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.

596
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,030
He said something about the Garden of
Meditation?

597
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,630
No, he said he's farting because of
his medication.

598
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,950
I get that.

599
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:55,750
It's a waste of time. I don't remember
anything. Do you?

600
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:00,950
No. I got nothing. Alan?

601
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,750
Alan!

602
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,550
<i>"Every memory lives somewhere deep within"</i>

603
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,070
<i>- Sweetie.
- What?</i>

604
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,670
<i>You have visitors.</i>

605
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,670
<i>- Hey, Alan!
- Hey, guys!</i>

606
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,590
<i>- Hey, Phil.
- Hey buddy!</i>

607
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,430
<i>Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.</i>

608
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,190
<i>- Is this true, Stuart?
- Yeah, why not. It'll be fun.</i>

609
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,470
<i>Fuck!</i>

610
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,110
<i>- For Lauren and Stu!
- Cheers!</i>

611
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,670
<i>- Chow!
- We had a sick night bitches!</i>

612
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:37,430
<i>Alan, what the fuck!</i>

613
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,470
<i>Is that person coming to the wedding?</i>

614
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,990
<i>- There is no wolfpack.
- Alan, Alan, don't do that!</i>

615
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,630
<i>And finally...</i>

616
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,990
<i>The three best friends anyone could have.</i>

617
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,910
<i>Fuck the Police!</i>

618
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,590
I know where to go.

619
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,230
- What do you think, Alan?
- This is the place.

620
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,230
C'mon. Let's go.

621
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,670
I don't remember any of this!

622
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,230
- Yeah Alan, you sure this is the place?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

623
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,910
Rose! Harmony!

624
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,750
Is he coming or what? I've been waiting
all day for him.

625
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,990
- I'm sorry. Waiting for who?
- Chow, that dick ass fuck!

626
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:52,350
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothings wrong.

627
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:57,390
Ok, good. Look at this. Look what I
bring for him. Check it out, huh.

628
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,830
- No, no!
- $ 6,000 American.

629
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,030
Wow looks so real!

630
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,510
Sorry!

631
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:14,910
- Alan, what the fuck!
- It's ok. The gun, it's very sensitive.

632
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,310
Everybody ok?

633
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:22,990
Ok, then get the fuck back to work!
Come on. Music, please!

634
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,150
Where is my 6,000 dollars?

635
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,790
6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow's deal. We
got nothing to do with that.

636
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,790
Un-fucking believable.

637
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,430
This guy, if he backs out again, the
shits gonna catch up with him.

638
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,150
He's made a lot of enemies in this town,
and now they're gonna be your enemies.

639
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,550
That's not fair!

640
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,030
Ok listen. We're just looking for a
little kid.

641
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,910
- 2,000 dollars.
- What!

642
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,670
I don't know, maybe more. How young you
want this kid to be?

643
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:53,270
No, no! Sorry, you misunderstood. We're
looking for our friend... 16 years old.

644
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,110
- Teddy.
- Teddy?

645
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:57,430
- Yeah he was here with you guys last night.
- He was?

646
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,030
Do you know if he left with us?

647
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:01,670
I don't know. You were in the corner all
night with Kimmy.

648
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,350
- I didn't see you leave.
- Kimmy?

649
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,630
- Is she here?
- Yes, she's in the back. She just came for her shit.

650
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,990
Go and talk to her.

651
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,750
Alright, listen. I'm sorry about everything
that happened.

652
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,150
Listen to me, ok? Pay attention to what
I'm going to talk to you know.

653
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:17,110
When you see Chow, you tell him Samir
says "Hello".

654
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:17,950
Okay!

655
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:22,550
But do it like that, ok! "Hello" like
threatening. Like, ironic.

656
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,950
- "Hellooo"
- Okay!

657
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,950
Go away! Go away!

658
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,350
??

659
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,910
Of course I remember him. He was buying
shots for everyone.

660
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,470
Nice kid! His parents must be so proud.

661
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:43,910
You have no idea.

662
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:46,550
Ok, so do you remember if he left with us?

663
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,270
Yeah, you were all leaving together, but
you almost forgot this one right here.

664
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,350
Right, super star?

665
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:57,470
This one was following me around like a
little puppy dog. All night.

666
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,510
Saying he'd fallen in love with me. Asked
me to marry him.

667
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,590
Classic Stu!

668
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,110
- We didn't get married, did we?
- Course not!

669
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,550
We just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.

670
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,110
- What happens in the Chardonnay room?
- Let's just stay on task.

671
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:19,270
I danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.

672
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,830
- Fuck!
- It's ok. You're not married yet.

673
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,670
- No big deal.
- It's cheating!

674
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,510
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.

675
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,630
It's a violation of my moral code.

676
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:33,950
Don't be sad. Stu you loved it. You were
crying, saying how special it was.

677
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,710
- Wait! I'm sorry. He was crying?
- What a baby. He was crying.

678
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:42,110
You should have seen him. He was so
sexy. The way he moved around.

679
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,070
I had to ask him to slow down so I didn't
drop my load too quick.

680
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:52,390
- Load? What load?
- Oh, you know... My sperms.

681
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:57,070
I think your English is off. You're talking
about my sperm!

682
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:01,110
- Where would your sperm come from?
- From my balls!

683
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,550
- Hold on! Back up!
- Wait... Are you...

684
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,710
Hey. You're in Bangkok, sweetie.

685
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,110
- There's a reason they don't call it "Bang-cunt".
- Oh!

686
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,910
- Oh god!
- Wow.

687
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,750
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

688
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:28,150
Come on, Stu, it was beautiful. We climaxed
at the same time.

689
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,510
How's that work?

690
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,270
Shoot my load into you. Shoot your load
on the floor.

691
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:37,710
- Ok!
- You ruined me. Ruined bottom.

692
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,950
Oh god!

693
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:52,510
- Stu! It's not the end of the world.
- Sorry, but I'm so confused.

694
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,510
I made love to a man... with boobies.

695
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,270
Listen. I promise you no ones ever gonna
find out about this.

696
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:01,990
But we found out about it.

697
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,230
And then we forget. That's what we do!

698
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:07,550
I do so much fucked up shit. And I just
forget about it.

699
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,710
- Yeah?
- Yeah! Just forget! It goes away!

700
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,230
That might be harder to go away, but in
time it'll happen.

701
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:18,990
I certainly do. Just gonna forget about it.

702
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,990
- Never happened.
- Great!

703
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,110
Phone! Phone! Who is it? Answer!

704
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,390
Lauren's dad. He just reminded me...

705
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,150
- Answer it!
- I can't.

706
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:31,870
What! He might know something about Teddy.
C'mon we still have a shot here.

707
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:35,390
Get your head back into the fucking game, Stu!

708
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,070
Hello?

709
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,310
<i>Who takes an all day fishing trip the
day before a wedding?</i>

710
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:49,150
- Yeah, I guess that is kinda stupid.
- Put Teddy on the phone.

711
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,190
<i>- Teddy's seasick actually.
- Seasick?</i>

712
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:59,350
- Teddy's been a Maritime cadet since he was nine.
- That's weird, cause he's puking everywhere.

713
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:02,230
I'm gonna tell you something that you do
not know.

714
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,790
- I don't like you.
- Yeah,I knew that already.

715
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,590
<i>If my daughter chooses you,
that's her problem.</i>

716
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,230
This is ??.
Hey it's Phil Winnick!

717
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:12,110
Listen, I apologize. We've been reelin
in some crazy Marlin and I just wanna say...

718
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,550
Phil!

719
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,110
- Jesus!
- Phil!

720
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,870
Fuck me!

721
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:21,950
- Give us back our monkey!
- What monkey? Get your own monkey!

722
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,630
Come on, you asshole, the fucking monkey!

723
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,350
Come on!

724
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,670
Anytime, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us!

725
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:29,790
This is our monkey!

726
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,990
No one's getting shot over a fucking monkey!

727
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,710
Hand him over, now!

728
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,430
God, I've never given him no monkeys.

729
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,350
No, no ...

730
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,790
Hey Phil, check it out. He's got a banana
on his helmet. He's the real deal.

731
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,030
What the fuck's happening?

732
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,910
Hold on! How did this happen? Do you
know where our friend is?

733
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:53,430
<i>- Yeah. Sixteen years old. Asian kid.
- (says something in Russian?)</i>

734
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,910
No, I don't understand what you said! No, I
didn't understand!

735
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,510
What'd he say?

736
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,550
He said fuck you and your questions!

737
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:06,470
- Oh, my arm!
- Philip, are you okay?

738
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,070
Oh I got shot! Fuck! Fuck this!

739
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,510
It's alright, Phil! It's alright!

740
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,830
We'll figure this out and get the monkey
back, I promise.

741
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,710
Who gives a fuck about the monkey!

742
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:24,630
- What the fuck is going on?
- Stu, am I gonna be ok? You're a doctor.

743
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,390
I don't know, let me look!

744
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:29,590
What?

745
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,030
Don't look at it!

746
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,430
Stuart Price! Get your ass back over here!

747
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,110
- You got shot!
- I know!

748
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:55,510
- Whoa, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

749
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:00,390
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm.
Eight stitches.

750
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,830
Only cost six dollars. How is that even
possible?

751
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,830
How's any of this even possible?

752
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:12,630
If I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.

753
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,390
What are we gonna do?

754
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,870
I'm sorry guys. This wasn't part of the plan.

755
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:30,190
- What plan, Alan?
- I've said too much already.

756
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,470
Alan! What plan?

757
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,750
- It's all Teddy's fault.
- What are you talking about, Alan?

758
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,030
Why is he even here? He's not part of
the wolf pack!

759
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:51,830
- Alan, what did you do?
- It's not my fault!

760
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:54,790
Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.

761
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,070
- What bag?
- The marshmallows.

762
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,870
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

763
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,550
But it was dark and it was hard to keep
track.

764
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,870
And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't
tell which was which.

765
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:07,710
- It was mayhem!
- What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?

766
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,670
Alan, what did you do?

767
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,710
Isn't it obvious?

768
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,870
I spiked them with muscle relaxers. And
plus my ADHD medication.

769
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,870
- What?
- You drugged us again?!

770
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:22,750
Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy for a
little while so we could finally enjoy the weekend.

771
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:27,110
Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that
you didn't do anything!

772
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,910
Alan, you swore to god!

773
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,830
I just wanted things to stay the same.

774
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,390
Like at my face! You ruined my life!

775
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,030
You're not my friend!

776
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,670
Don't say that, Phil! You're serious?
Even in America?

777
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,510
- Yes!
- Oh God! Don't say that, Phil!

778
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:46,470
- Don't start crying, Alan!
- You're the bearded devil!

779
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,430
You liked it! You smiled at me when I
handed you the bag with marshmallows.

780
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,430
Because I like marshmallows, you
fucking psycho!

781
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,790
Hey! Whoa! Hold on!

782
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:58,430
Enough!

783
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:01,390
- Why, Alan? Why?
- Stu!

784
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,750
Because we're the three best
friends, remember?

785
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,870
Remember?

786
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,430
Stu, that's enough...

787
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,990
Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta
stick together.

788
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:23,110
- Alan, what's that written on your belly?
- What? Huh?

789
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,430
Lebua Hotel, Saturday six pm.

790
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,270
- You write that?
- No!

791
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,190
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

792
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,590
What about England, Phil? Will we still
be friends there?

793
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:40,470
Alan, I already told you. It was in the heat of the
moment. We're still friends. All over the world.

794
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,230
- Even Great Britain?
- Yeah.

795
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,030
What about you, Stu?

796
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,590
We'll see.

797
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,910
Gentlemen, follow me.

798
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,430
Here you go.

799
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:14,750
Well. About time! Sit down.

800
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,230
Come on, sit.

801
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,830
Wow, you guys look like shit.

802
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:24,030
- Uh, do we know you?
- Hey!

803
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,310
Take off your fuckin hat. You're in a
restaurant for christs sake. C'mon.

804
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:35,550
Ok, listen. We have no clue what's
going on here.

805
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:39,350
You know, they sell a Plum whiskey here,
it's fuckin unreal.

806
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:46,790
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up! Oh, I'm
sorry. You guys already got fucked up, didn't you.

807
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:53,510
- Uh, listen, I'm a little confused. How did you...
- You know what? I am a little fuckin confused!

808
00:59:53,630 --> 01:00:00,230
Where's Chow? With the fuckin account
code and the fuckin password!

809
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:10,950
We don't know anything about any codes. We're
just trying to find our friend.

810
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:17,670
- Teddy?
- Yes! Teddy! Have you seen?

811
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:22,710
Hmm, let's see...

812
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,550
There's Teddy!

813
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:29,670
Holy shit! It's from last night.

814
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:34,190
- Who are you?
- I'm a businessman.

815
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,430
And I've invested a large chunk of capital
in your friend Chow.

816
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,350
And in return, he was supposed to transfer
my profits electronically.

817
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,590
About five fuckin minutes ago.

818
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:50,070
So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.

819
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,990
- Oh my god! Is he okay?
- Oh my god, I wasn't done talking.

820
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,070
You tell Chow, that we are having breakfast
on the roof of this hotel...

821
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,590
...tomorrow morning at eight am.

822
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,630
Or if he makes the transfer, you will
get Teddy.

823
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,190
If not well then hey, you know...
it's Bangkok.

824
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,830
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

825
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,990
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

826
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,990
Alan leave the hat.

827
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,630
Atta boy.

828
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:40,950
We're fucked! Chow's dead. What do we do now?

829
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,390
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow, Stu.
This whole things about a fucking bank account.

830
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:49,230
Let's just go back to the hotel. We'll
search Chow's body.

831
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,870
Hopefully the password's in his
wallet or something.

832
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,790
- And what if it isn't?
- He's gonna kill Teddy.

833
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:58,510
Just relax. We have until 8am tomorrow
to figure it out.

834
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:06,510
First the monkey and now my hat. How
much worse can this day get.

835
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,150
Jesus christ!

836
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:29,190
<i>Well we're livin here in Alan town. And
he's drivin our lives into the ground.</i>

837
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:34,070
<i>When we woke up we were wasted and drunk.</i>

838
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:39,670
<i>Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk.</i>

839
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:46,390
<i>I was happy, and my life was good.</i>

840
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:51,270
<i>Getting married like a dentist should.</i>

841
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,830
<i>Roasting marshmallows on a stick.</i>

842
01:02:54,990 --> 01:03:01,070
<i>I got fucked in the ass... by a girl
with a dick.</i>

843
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,830
Oh yeah, remember that.

844
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:10,430
<i>And we're livin in Alan town.</i>

845
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,230
There's water everywhere.

846
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,830
Yeah it's cause it melted, Stu. The
fuckin powers out.

847
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,630
With an inadequate electrical grid,
serving millions of people

848
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,870
Bangkok experiences 1500 power
outages per year.

849
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,870
Seriously, Alan. That's enough!

850
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,390
Out of the way!

851
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:34,870
We got it.

852
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:41,950
Oh my god!

853
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:46,110
Chow, calm down!

854
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,910
- You put the chill on me?
- No, no!

855
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:53,070
It's okay.

856
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,310
Relax!

857
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:07,470
It's just us. Breathe!

858
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:08,750
It was so cold.

859
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:11,070
- We're gonna warm you up.
- I was so cold!

860
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:15,790
- You did good, buddy. You did good.
- I did good.

861
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,270
Feelin better?

862
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:26,070
- Alright, you warm enough?
- I don't know.

863
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:28,030
Come feel my bowels and tell me.

864
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,910
I've been locked in a fuckin ice box
all day!

865
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,910
Hey Alan, if you want my sunglasses...

866
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:36,950
...just ask Chow. You don't have to kill me.

867
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:40,910
Chow, nobody killed you. You were already
dead. You didn't have a pulse.

868
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,870
Oh, you never do blow before?

869
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:45,110
Sometimes your heart stop... start
up again.

870
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:48,550
- Read a book!
- Look I'm sorry. We're having a bad day.

871
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:52,150
Oh, you're having a bad day! Did you die?

872
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,510
- I got shot!
- But did you die?

873
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:58,990
Chow, some guy told us that you got
a bank code or something...

874
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,110
...and if we don't bring it to him first
think in the morning...

875
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:03,830
...he's gonna kill Teddy.

876
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:09,990
Who, Kingsley? He harmless. Don't worry.
I got the bank codes.

877
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:15,670
Great! Alright, we gotta meet him at 8am.
Who is that fuckin guy, anyway?

878
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:19,110
- An investor in my business.
- Yeah, what business is that?

879
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,670
It's called "not your business" ok!

880
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:25,590
- Oh, where's the monkey?
- The monkey...

881
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:29,550
Yeah I put the account number and
password in his vest. Where is he?

882
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:35,670
- Why would you do that?
- Safe keeping, pretty boy.

883
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:42,870
I got a lotta heat on my ass. I got
FBI, Bangkok PD, Interpol, MSNBC...

884
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:45,310
That little monkey snorting coke with me
all night...

885
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:48,270
Jerkin me off while I watched Stu make
fuckin lady boy.

886
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:52,190
- He not going anywhere.
- We don't have the monkey, Chow.

887
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:55,030
Oh, some Russian thugs took him from us.

888
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:57,110
Oh you fucking guys!

889
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,550
Okay. No problem. We just have to get
him back.

890
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:04,870
- From where?
- From the same place we took him from.

891
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,710
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

892
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:42,790
Every night, monkey drug mule.

893
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,470
He take coke to buyer...

894
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:53,150
And deliver cash to dealer. He
middle man.

895
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,950
Dealer never handle drug directly.

896
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:58,150
He clean.

897
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:04,070
- That's terrible.
- Not terrible. What he talking about. Fucking genius.

898
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,270
You ever see monkey go to jail?

899
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:12,350
We just take the monkey for deal, he come
close, we take his vest. That's that.

900
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:17,190
- We get some blow too, you know... bump.
- No, no more bumps, Chow.

901
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:21,030
This is ridiculous.

902
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:26,070
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle. Shake your
monkey.

903
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:38,750
Alright, here we go.

904
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:40,190
Come on!

905
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,270
How did we wind up with the monkey
last night anyway?

906
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,510
I needed some blow and Alan thought
he was cute...

907
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:50,870
...so we stole him!

908
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:04,070
So stupid!

909
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,550
Stu, ready to grab vest?

910
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:10,150
- Okay. I just grab it?
- Yeah, just do it. Just do it.

911
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,950
- Hey, little monkey.
- Alan, be quiet.

912
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,870
- Fuck!
- We gotta go, right now!

913
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,070
- Pull that fuckin monkey in!
- I'm trying!

914
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,430
Shit!

915
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:35,030
- Get that monkey in here, Stu!
- He won't let go!

916
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,070
Stu, get back in the car! Right now!

917
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:40,630
I'm trying! Slow down!

918
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,550
He's so strong!

919
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,630
Let go you fuckin monkey!

920
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,430
- Look out!
- Oh shit! Tight squeeze!

921
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:01,630
I got him!

922
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:08,150
- Where's the code, Chow?
- Check his little vest.

923
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:13,710
- Got it, Alan?
- Yes, I got a .

924
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:17,070
- Slow down Chow!
- Hold on, J-Birds.

925
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,030
Holy Shit!

926
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,390
Don't worry. I got this shit!

927
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,030
Pig!

928
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:34,430
Oh, my word.

929
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:35,950
Sorry, Stu! My bad!

930
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:42,750
Oh, shit!

931
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:45,030
Get down!

932
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,790
What the fuck!

933
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,430
Oh no! He shot the monkey!

934
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:53,190
They shot the monkey.

935
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:55,030
I'm at my wits end.

936
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,510
He's coming back around.

937
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,350
Look out!

938
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,790
- Holy fuck!
- Oh no...

939
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,350
- Everyone alright?
- Yeah.

940
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:31,990
I have such an erection right now!

941
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,550
Are you for real?

942
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,950
They're gonna take good care of you
here, ok.

943
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:57,710
What's that?

944
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:04,750
Oh, yeah. Cigarettes. Got em right here.
Here you go.

945
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:10,230
Right here.

946
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:16,070
Deep breathe. Good.

947
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,630
Soak it in.

948
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:23,070
Breathe the smoke into your tiny
little lungs. There you go.

949
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:26,670
It's funny. I've never been much of a
smoker, but...

950
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:30,030
Boy does it look cool on you.

951
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,910
Alan, c'mon! Let's go!

952
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:37,750
I'll miss you, monkey.

953
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:42,670
I wish monkeys could Skype.

954
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:45,950
Maybe one day...

955
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:55,750
Come on! Get in!

956
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:32,390
Are you guys seriously this calm?

957
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,030
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

958
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:36,950
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

959
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,670
You ever do anything that doesn't end
up in a standoff, Chow?

960
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,910
I'm an international criminal. It always
ends like this.

961
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,710
I met my wife at one of these things.

962
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:49,710
- You got a wife?
- Yeah, we married 15 years.

963
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:52,310
What, I not good looking enough for woman?

964
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:55,030
No, that's cool.

965
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:57,670
Let's do this!

966
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,470
- Welcome to the Tower Club.
- Blah blah blah, who cares.

967
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:04,270
Stop! Chow crossing.

968
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:10,790
- Hey, Kingsley!
- Well, well.

969
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,670
Propecia looking nice!

970
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:14,710
You been hitting the gym?

971
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,990
Yes I am actually. Thank you for
noticing, Chow.

972
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,990
Hey, guys. Have a seat.

973
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:24,070
- Where's Teddy?
- He's waiting downstairs in my car.

974
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,390
Send him up when the transfer is complete.

975
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:29,230
Tell you what. Give me extra 50 grand, you
keep Teddy.

976
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:31,950
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

977
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:36,830
- Chow.. Chow...
- Could we move this along!

978
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:41,270
Alan, account number. Come on, come on.

979
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:51,030
8-1-4, K as in knife, 2-3-9-8.

980
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:54,910
- Password?
- "baloney1"

981
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:56,910
Your password is "baloney1" ?

982
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:59,790
Well it used to be just "baloney" but
now they make you add number.

983
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,910
Fuckin annoying.

984
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,190
- And it's that easy.
- Ta dah!

985
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,510
Oh look. You sunk my battleship.

986
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:25,910
- Great, now can we please have Teddy?
- Yeah. Bring him up.

987
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:30,070
See. We go to your wedding. We have fun. I
bust a nut.

988
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:32,150
We did it, Stu. It's over!

989
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:43,870
This is Bangkok police! Everybody down!

990
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,070
Oh, nuts!

991
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:50,310
Kingsley, you're fucking Five-O?

992
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:51,750
Gotcha, Leslie!

993
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,030
Get him outta here.

994
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:54,510
Go! Just do it! Go!

995
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:00,870
How the fuck...

996
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:06,070
Samir, you fucked me over six grand?
You camel jockey!

997
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,470
You spit on me?

998
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:15,590
Six grand this time, eight grand last time.
It's not the money, man, it's the principle!

999
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,510
Principle? Nigga, please! We both dead inside.

1000
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:20,910
Call me nigga... don't call me "nigga"!

1001
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:23,750
- Put em in, motherfucker!
- He's an asshole, man.

1002
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,470
You guys ok?

1003
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:29,670
- What the fucks going on?
- Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

1004
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:31,030
- You're a cop?
- Yes.

1005
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,950
This sting operation has been in place
for weeks.

1006
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:36,190
When Samir told us that your friend
was lost...

1007
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:40,830
We took advantage of that information.
I'm sorry.

1008
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:45,990
- So can Teddy come out of the car now?
- No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fuckin car!

1009
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,910
They don't have him. They never had him.

1010
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:52,430
They just needed us to bring them Chow.
They used Teddy as bait.

1011
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:56,710
- Do you have any leads at all?
- No. We've checked everywhere.

1012
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:58,750
No one has seen him. I'm sorry.

1013
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:04,510
If you haven't found him by now, I'm afraid
Bangkok has him.

1014
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,190
Why do people keep saying that?

1015
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:17,230
Stu... It's time.

1016
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:23,670
Alan...

1017
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:28,950
-I'm sorry.
- Don't say that. Please.

1018
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:33,150
- No this time we really fucked up.
- Oh god! How bad?

1019
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,270
<i>Like, no wedding bad?</i>

1020
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:38,750
Yeah... a little worse than that!

1021
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:08,030
Ok, how about this? He fell off
the fishing boat and drowned.

1022
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,750
No.

1023
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:15,150
Ok, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.

1024
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:18,950
- Alan!
- Not a good time, Phil. Kinda busy!

1025
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,830
How many people get run over here?

1026
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:24,150
- Over 1200 a year, Phil.
- Perfect!

1027
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:27,430
His body was too mangled to recover.
Case closed.

1028
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:30,630
Can I get more ice, please?

1029
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:33,270
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

1030
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:40,710
- Stu, do you want this or not?
- Look at what I've done, Phil. What I do.

1031
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:48,270
I have a weakness for prostitutes. All
kinds, apparently.

1032
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:57,030
- I have a demon in me!
- So what?

1033
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,430
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.

1034
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,390
Just let her live her life without me.

1035
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,670
Stu!

1036
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:07,950
I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm
never coming back.

1037
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:10,350
Gettin off the hamster wheel.

1038
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:15,350
Gonna stay here in Bangkok.
I think I belong here.

1039
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:18,390
Open up a little dentists office.

1040
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,710
Deep cleanings, with a happy ending.

1041
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,110
You sure about this?

1042
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:36,750
Hey, what the crud!

1043
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:39,630
Powers out, Alan.

1044
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:44,910
- Phil!
- Doug.

1045
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,390
- I need answers, man.
- I know...

1046
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:49,270
Doug, who are you talking to?

1047
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,230
- What?
- Give me the phone!

1048
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,470
Lauren, no! That's a private...

1049
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:52,630
Who is this?

1050
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:56,030
- Lauren?
- Phil? Tell me what's going on, right now!

1051
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:58,110
We lost your little brother.

1052
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:01,270
- What?
- Bangkok has him now.

1053
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,110
You gotta take the stairs.

1054
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,150
You're in Bangkok?

1055
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,030
Ooh, that's a finger!

1056
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:20,470
Put Stu on the phone!

1057
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:24,710
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages
per year.

1058
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:26,990
<i>Stu really doesn't want to talk to anybody.</i>

1059
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,030
<i>- Water everywhere. Powers out.</i>

1060
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,430
<i>Come on, Stu, use that big Jewish brain</i>

1061
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:36,790
Phil! Give me the phone!

1062
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,670
- It's Lauren! I got it! I'm handling it!
- I know.!

1063
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,510
- Give me the fuckin...
- I can handle it, Stu!

1064
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:42,070
She's gonna break your heart!

1065
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,510
Honey, sweetheart, it's me! I'm so sorry!

1066
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:48,270
Stu? What the hell is going on? What does he
mean you lost Teddy?

1067
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:53,070
What? Is that what Phil said?
No no no. We misplaced, Teddy.

1068
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:55,750
But we're all good now. We heading back to the
hotel. We're gonna see you soon!

1069
01:19:57,110 --> 01:20:01,910
I love you so much! And I gotta go, but
I'll see you soon. Bye.

1070
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:05,990
Stu!

1071
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:10,910
- Stu!
- God!

1072
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,550
Taxi!

1073
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,950
Come on, Alan!

1074
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,910
Hey, you mind filling us in!

1075
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,470
Ok, now when we woke up, the power was out.

1076
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,790
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1077
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:28,910
- In a pool of water.
- But it didn't start out as water.

1078
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:30,630
No, it was ice.

1079
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,270
Exactly! Teddy got ice from the machine...

1080
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:34,910
...came back to the room. Put his finger
on ice and fell asleep.

1081
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:35,870
Now what do you do if you wake up...

1082
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:38,510
...and you find your finger floating in
a bowl of melted ice?

1083
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:41,950
I'd get more ice, Stu... on the 15th
fuckin floor!

1084
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:45,070
Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

1085
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:50,230
- Holy shit! Of course!
- He's at the ice machine.

1086
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,390
Alan, no!

1087
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,750
It's on ten!

1088
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,470
- Sir, is the elevator stuck?
- ??.

1089
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:00,910
- C'mon!
- Go, go, go!

1090
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:07,270
Hey, Teddy!

1091
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,630
Look out, look out!

1092
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:19,670
- Teddy!
- You're ok!

1093
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:23,510
Teddy, you okay? You ok, man?

1094
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:27,150
- Where am I?
- You're in an elevator, in the middle of Bangkok.

1095
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,430
But we're gonna get you outta here. It's
gonna be fine.

1096
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:32,830
Hey Stu, nice tattoo.

1097
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,110
Thanks, man.

1098
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,670
Alright, let's do this! C'mon, c'mon!

1099
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:44,870
Tell him we found him.
Yeah, I know. But we're on our way. Ok, bye!

1100
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:50,230
Alright, guests are arriving, people starting
to ask questions, but we can still pull this off!

1101
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:52,990
- How?
- I don't know, with a taxi?

1102
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:54,470
- Chow's speed boat.
- What?

1103
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:56,790
Last think I remember, was getting off
Chow's speed boat.

1104
01:21:56,910 --> 01:22:00,230
- Chow has a speed boat?
- "The Perfect Life".

1105
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:02,550
C'mon!

1106
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:07,750
Stu, get that back line.

1107
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:11,110
Good jump, Phil!

1108
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:14,790
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1109
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:18,790
- You sure you know how to drive this thing?

1110
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:20,470
Please, I was raised in a yacht club. I
know what I'm doing.

1111
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:44,870
You know where we're going?

1112
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:47,670
Leave it to the Captain!

1113
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:49,630
Oh fuck you, Alan!

1114
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:54,030
Do you know where we're going, Captain?

1115
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,030
Affirmative cadet!
We're going south.

1116
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:00,750
- We're in the Gulf of Thailand.
- Good.

1117
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:23,990
Hey! You okay?

1118
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,710
- Feeling a little better.
- Alright!

1119
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:33,430
Listen Teddy. I'm really sorry! We didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

1120
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:43,070
It's funny. I can't remember anything
But... when I woke up, I was kinda happy.

1121
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:45,270
Yeah!

1122
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:50,390
By the way... Do you have any idea
where my finger is?

1123
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:52,750
Yeah, we gave it to a drug dealing
monkey.

1124
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:57,710
Bangkok...

1125
01:23:58,190 --> 01:24:01,790
Yeah, right... fuckin Bangkok!

1126
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:17,230
I apologize. There will be no wedding!

1127
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,270
He is on his way. He will be here...

1128
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:23,550
Please, if you will all move to the bar.
We are going to clear this area.

1129
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:25,350
Please!

1130
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:30,430
<i>I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.</i>

1131
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,510
Look! There they are!

1132
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:41,590
Stu!

1133
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:50,230
- Alan, there's no dock.
- Just hang on!

1134
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:52,990
- Alan, it's not funny! Turn the boat!
- Hang on!

1135
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:55,190
- Is that Alan driving the boat?
- What?

1136
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:58,390
Uh, we should probably move back a little bit.

1137
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,710
Oh my god!

1138
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,830
Turn the boat!

1139
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:05,310
Everyone back up a little bit here.

1140
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:07,270
Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

1141
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:26,350
Hi! Hi everybody!

1142
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:32,790
Came in a little hotter than we planned.
I'm sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1143
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,790
Totally fixable. A little bit of sod, it'll
be fine.

1144
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,630
- Baby!
- Oh my god!

1145
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:39,630
I'm so happy to see you!

1146
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:45,270
- Teddy! Teddy here.
- Hi, Dad!

1147
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:48,110
- You alright?
- Yeah, ok.

1148
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,350
- Your hand!
- I know.

1149
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:54,510
We had an accident. I'm ok.

1150
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:57,670
This is your fault!

1151
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:02,510
- Dad.
- He's right. I have not been completely honest.

1152
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:04,030
- Stu? Don't do this.
-Yeah?

1153
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,790
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1154
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:11,150
You said I'm a joke.Well I'm not.

1155
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:18,950
I'm not some weird, milky, ricy, watery
that you feed to infants and old people, ok!

1156
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:22,830
Maybe I would be if you added some
cayenne pepper!

1157
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,070
I wish I was a boring dentist...

1158
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:29,230
...who had a boring life and boring friends...

1159
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:31,070
... but I don't and I'm not.

1160
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:33,990
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1161
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:37,510
It's not weird. It's pretty cool
actually. No membership fees.

1162
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:39,990
I've had enough of this. Come here.

1163
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:44,150
Whoa! Here's the deal man.

1164
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:48,070
- I got a dark side!

1165
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:50,070
There's a demon in me!

1166
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:52,870
It's true, he has semen in him.

1167
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:54,750
I said demon.

1168
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:59,510
- But you also have semen in you, remember?
- Not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1169
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:07,150
The point is, this demon takes me to
some pretty weird places.

1170
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:10,190
We lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.

1171
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:14,870
But that same demon took us to
hell and back to find him.

1172
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:17,350
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1173
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:20,070
Now that's pretty fuckin cool if you ask me!

1174
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:28,910
I love your daughter, and I'm
gonna marry her.

1175
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:31,270
- Unless you have any problem with that?
- I'm good.

1176
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:37,710
But all that said, it would actually mean
a great deal to both of us...

1177
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,990
...if we could just get your mother fucking
blessing!

1178
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:58,590
Hey, Alan...

1179
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:03,550
- That looks pretty cool shaved.
- Thanks, Phil.

1180
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:05,750
You should shave your head too.

1181
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:09,390
- Why would I do that?
- Well than we would look exactly alike.

1182
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:23,790
- Take good care of my daughter, Stu.
- I will.

1183
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,470
I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with
the boat.

1184
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:36,070
Just happy you're here.

1185
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:42,630
And don't worry about the tattoo. I'm gonna
have it lasered as soon as we're home in LA.

1186
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:46,710
- That's ok. I can get used to it.
- Really?

1187
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:51,550
But for now, let's switch sides?

1188
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:54,070
- Yeah, ok.
- Thank you.

1189
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:56,710
Much better.

1190
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:01,830
Dear family and friends. On behalf of Stu and Lauren...

1191
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:06,030
...I welcome all of you, to this
marriage celebration.

1192
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,470
We are here today to...

1193
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:04,750
Hey buddy. Can you hold on for a second.

1194
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:06,430
Thank you.

1195
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,230
Hello? Hi everyone!

1196
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:20,110
My name's Alan Garner.

1197
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:26,390
I want to thank the Asiatic people for
allowing us in your land.

1198
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:31,790
I wanted to say that, um, I'm really
happy to be here...

1199
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:35,910
...and I have a wedding gift to present
to Lauren and Stu.

1200
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:39,590
And um, a lot of thought has gone into this...

1201
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:44,190
...and I hope that you appreciate it as
much as I did, or going to.

1202
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:45,790
Okay, guys!

1203
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:04,270
Oh, fuck!

1204
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:25,830
Alan!

1205
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:29,910
What the fuck?

1206
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:33,390
- So what do ya think?
- That's insane! How did you do that?

1207
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:35,110
My dad had to make a lot of calls.

1208
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:38,550
I told Mike that you gotta do it. It's
for my third best friend.

1209
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:43,150
Alan, it's amazing!
I love it! Thank you so much!

1210
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:45,950
We only have him for tonight. We don't
have him permanently.

1211
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:48,830
Understood!

1212
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:07,590
<i>- You do a lot of public speaking, Alan?
- I barely ??</i>

1213
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:12,750
Mike, you were great. It's true, that
was incredible.

1214
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:15,470
Thanks, guys. That means a lot, really!

1215
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,990
By the way, you really need to remove that
fuckin tattoo from your face!

1216
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:20,910
Yeah! On it!

1217
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,710
Sorry about the last minute change up
to the performance, Mike.

1218
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:27,430
- Don't worry, Alan.
- What are you talking about?

1219
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:30,150
Well he was originally supposed to sing
"Burning Up" by the Jonas Brothers...

1220
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,310
...but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.

1221
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:35,390
Hey guys. You're not gonna believe this.

1222
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:37,510
- Is that your phone?
- Yeah.

1223
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:39,710
How come you never tried calling us?

1224
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:41,470
It's been dead for two days.

1225
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,910
But I recharged it and found all
these photos.

1226
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:45,150
What?

1227
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,350
- Shit!
- Yeah, some of it's pretty messed up.

1228
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:49,910
- Awesome, let's check em out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1229
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,790
No one needs to see this stuff!

1230
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:54,550
C'mon man! I'm Mike Tyson. I've seen everything!

1231
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:57,350
<i>- It'll be fine.
- (mumbles something)</i>

1232
01:32:58,230 --> 01:33:02,750
- Alright, we look at it once.
- And then we delete them. It's gonna be ok.

1233
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:05,470
- Oh, ooh!
- Mother fucker!
