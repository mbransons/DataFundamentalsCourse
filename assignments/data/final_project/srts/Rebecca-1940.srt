a dark and tortured jungle grew.</i>

<i>Nature had come into her own

<i>Manderley.</i>

<i>Like all dreamers, I was allowed
to pass through my memory.</i>

<i>Spanning the years like a bridge.</i>

11
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:29,625
<i>Back to that summer in Monte Carlo
when I knew nothing and had no prospects.</i>

12
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,125
Did you say eight?

13
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,625
- [driver] <i>Huit.</i>
- Yes.

- [driver] <i>Merci. Au revoir.
- Au revoir.</i>

[woman] <i>I can see
the girl I was so clearly,</i>

<i>even if I no longer recognize her.</i>

17
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,666
<i>And I wonder what my life
would have been without Mrs. Van Hopper.</i>

18
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,000
<i>Without that job.</i>

19
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,916
<i>Funny to think
that the course of my existence</i>

20

<i>If it wasn't for her,
I would never have gone to Manderley...</i>

22
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,500
<i>and would never have met you.</i>

23
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,666
Mrs. Van Hopper.

24
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,083
[Mrs. Van Hopper] What kept you?

25
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,833
I'm sorry. I had to wait
for a package at the post office. I...

26
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,571
I believe it's from your nephew.

27
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,458
Oh, photographs of his honeymoon
with that ghastly girl, I imagine.

28
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,541
Open it.

29
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,625
- Get a table downstairs for lunch.
- Yes. One o'clock as usual?

30
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,208
- Now. I've just seen Maxim de Winter.
- Oh, right.

31
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,000
Still heartbroken, by the look of it.

32
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,666
He's a friend of yours?

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,000
Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley.

34
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,125
- One of the finest homes in England.
- Oh, yes.

35
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,833
His wife died last year.
He's in dire need of company.

36
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,625
- Have the <i>maître d'</i> seat him next to me.
- Oh.

37
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,875
You'll have to tip.

38
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,833
Honestly, with everything
I'm teaching you,

39
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:17,956
you ought to be paying me.

40
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,875
- Thank you, Mrs. Van Hopper.
- Stupid girl.

<i>- Bonjour.

Ah! Madam Van Hopper's usual table?

00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,416
Oh, yes, thank you. <i>Merci.</i>

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,750
Oh, no. Um...

46
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,750
Wait, sorry. She was wondering
if a Mr. de Winter could sit with her.

00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,875
<i>- Monsieur </i>Maxim de Winter?
<i>- Oui.</i>

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,416
It is the choice of Mr. de Winter
where he wishes to be seated.

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,958
Oh, yes, of course.

<i>Merci.</i>

51
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,375
[stammers] So sorry. Is that not enough?
Um, here. I've got more.

52
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,958
- Oh!
- [coins clink]

53
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,000
God, I'm so sorry, <i>monsieur.</i>

[sighs] Just one moment.

55
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,625
Don't do it.
I've heard he's a terrible bore.

56
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,958
- Excuse me?
- This de Winter chap.

57
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,041
Thank you.

<i>"Des huîtres, une douzaine."</i>

61
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:34,041
Maxim de Winter. Well, I never.
I had no idea you were in Monte.

62
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,875
You must join us.

63
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:40,208
Edie Van Hopper.
I think you remember my nephew. Billy?

64
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,833
You met him at Blenheim last fall.
Billy Whitney. He's about my height.

65
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,375
He's got sandy hair
and he's got a bit of a lazy eye.

66
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,416
I can't imagine how I could've forgotten.
Do give my regards to Billy.

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,625
Oh, would you know?

68
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,041
He's married,
and to the most enchanting girl.

69
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,309
- Is he?
- He sent photographs.

70
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,958
I'll show you. Come here.
The wedding was divine.

71
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,125
I believe you,
but I prefer to lunch alone.

72
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,458
- Good day, Miss Van Hopper.
- Oh, no.

73
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:08,083
What? We're not related. She's staff.

74
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,125
Well, I mean,
I guess you could call her my ward.

75
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,333
Hmm, I see. Now, if you'll excuse me.

76
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,666
Darling, fetch those photographs.
Mr. de Winter would love to see them.

77
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,708
No, please. Don't trouble yourself.

78
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,166
- It's unnecessary.
- No trouble at all!

79
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,291
Not at all. Go along. Quickly.
No, no. She'll be down in a jiffy.

80
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,666
[women laughing]

81
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,458
[Mrs. Van Hopper]
This is my favorite part.

82
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,583
I asked her to get the photographs,

83
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:50,625
and she darts from the table,
and then she's gone. Doesn't come back.

84
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,250
I thought, "Oh, God, don't tell me
she started sketching."

85
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,625
- [all laughing]
- Oh, no, she's an artist.

86
00:05:56,375 --> 00:06:01,416
Anyway, she comes running back down,
reeking of cheap rose water.

87
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,166
<i>I mean, the smell of it!</i>

88
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,250
Show me an eligible bachelor

89
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:16,291
and I will show you a room full of women
acting like they've lost their minds.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's too late.

91
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,791
- Sorry.
- Never mind, sit down.

92
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,041
Related. I mean, imagine.

93
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:28,041
I loved the Manderley ball.
It was just so glamorous.

94
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,250
I suppose
that's all stopped since the tragedy.

95
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,000
Such a shocking thing that happened.

96
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,791
- How do you explain it?
- [woman 1] Awful.

97
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,791
- [woman 2] He adored her!
- [woman 3] Mmm.

98
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,000
His Rebecca.

99
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,416
[Mademoiselle] Morning, Mrs. Van Hopper.

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,875
[groaning]

101
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,541
- Mrs. Van Hopper?
- [groans]

102
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,708
Are you all right?

103
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,291
[Mrs. Van Hopper incoherently] I'm sick.
I'm sick.

104
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,958
I'm... I was sick all night.

105
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,875
- Call the... call the <i>medecin.</i>
- Okay.

106
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,416
- Call them right now. The doctor.
- All right.

107
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,083
Where is the bucket? Where's the bucket?

108
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,625
- I'll get the bucket! Here, I've got it.
- [vomits]

109
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,541
You are waiting for <i>madame?</i>

110
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,583
Oh, no. She's unwell.
The doctor told her to rest.

111
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,041
So, it's just me today.

112
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,500
It is not possible.
The terrace is for guests only.

113
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,083
But I'm a lady's companion... really?

114
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,875
Yes, it is not for staff.

115
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,291
<i>Monsieur?</i> The young lady will be
joining me. Set another place, please.

117
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,801
[in English] No, please.
I couldn't possibly.

118
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,250
It's absolutely fine.

119
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,958
- We needn't talk unless we feel like it.
- Oh.

120
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,208
You... you didn't have to do that.

121
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,458
My motives were entirely selfish.

122
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,375
This is yesterday's paper.
I've already read it.

123
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,416
Thank you. It's very kind.

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,166
- So, what is it you do for...
- I'm what's called "a lady's companion."

125
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,708
If a lady has to pay for company,
that says something about the lady.

126
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,235
[maître d'] May I take your order?

127
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,500
<i>Des huîtres, une douzaine.</i>

128
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,958
For breakfast?

129
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,375
You heard her. <i>Et encore du café.</i>

130
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,833
<i>Bien, Monsieur de Winter. Mademoiselle.</i>

131
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,291
If it's not rude, why her?

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,875
You would make an excellent
companion for any number of people.

133
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,333
I've always wanted to travel,
so there's that, and £90 a year.

134
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,875
I know that's not very much to you,
but it's a lot to me.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,208
I suppose you can
set a price on loneliness.

136
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,291
It's odd, isn't it?
Some people seem perfectly happy alone

137
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,833
while others just need someone
to pass the time with. Doesn't matter who.

138
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,916
Which are you?

139
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,833
Well, my parents are dead, so...
I'm used to being alone.

140
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:03,916
Ah.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
Here comes your breakfast.

<i>Et voilà. Une douzaine d'huîtres.</i>

- I've always wanted to try them, so...
- [chuckles]

144
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,708
Try them before they get warm.

145

[laughter]

147
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,416
Thank you so much.
I've never spoken so much in my life.

148
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,976
- It was very impressive.
- [chuckles]

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,458
- And I'm sorry about the oysters, too. I...
- No, that was fine.

150
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,541
Thank you very much. I...

151
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,458
I haven't enjoyed myself
like that for quite a long time.

[Mrs. Van Hopper] Hello?

154
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,583
- [groaning]
- [knocking at door]

155
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,708
- A note from the front desk.
- <i>Merci.</i> Madame's indisposed.

156
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,831
- I'll take it to her.
- It's for you,<i> mademoiselle.</i>

157
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,541
<i>Merci.</i>

158
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,375
[Mrs. Van Hopper] What do they want?

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Um...

160
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,875
It was just the front desk, they were...

161
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,916
<i>wondering how you are.</i>

162
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,208
[Maxim] So how did you escape?

163
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,458
I said I had a tennis lesson.
She's been on at me to improve my game.

164
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,541
Sneaky.

165
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,791
- So where do you want to go?
- Anywhere is fine.

166
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,041
[Maxim] There must be
somewhere you want to see.

167
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,666
[Mademoiselle] Well, it's quite far.

168
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,291
[Maxim] Good. I could use the fresh air.

169
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,791
[Mademoiselle] Is this
a 3.5-liter Bentley?

170
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,125
[Maxim] It is.
How do you know so much about cars?

171
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,291
[Mademoiselle] Oh, my father,
he loved them.

172
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,458
[Maxim] If I may ask,
when did your parents pass away?

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,750
Two winters ago. Influenza.

174
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,958
Well, my mother
died of influenza, and my...

175
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,916
father died just four days later.

176
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,708
Do you think a person
could die of a broken heart?

177
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:46,208
- That was thoughtless of me. I'm sorry.
- No.

178
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,476
- [car honking]
- [Mademoiselle shrieks]

179
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,208
- [exhales]
- It's all right.

180
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,666
All part of the plan.

181
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,375
[chuckles]

182
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,541
EXOTIC GARDEN
PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING

183
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,000
[Mademoiselle] <i>There's a cactus,
it's native to Mexico,</i>

184
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,833
<i>and it grows to 65 feet tall.</i>

185
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,708
It lives for 200 years,
but it doesn't flower until it's 70.

186
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,125
[chuckles] Where do you learn this stuff?

187
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,833
I read about it.
Everything I know is from books.

188
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:27,291
I haven't really experienced anything yet.
I plan to before I'm old.

189
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,583
Look!

190
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,250
Have you been here before?

191
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,083
Years ago. On my honeymoon.

192
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,541
- How did your wife...
- Please... let's not.

193
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,541
[Mademoiselle] Mr. de Winter.

194
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,375
- Go on.
- Oh, no. I couldn't.

195
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,250
Yes. Yes, you can.
You know how, don't you?

196
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,875
Um, well, yes, I...

197
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,416
Well, good.
As long as you didn't learn from a book.

198
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,708
- [honks]
- [Mademoiselle chuckles]

199
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,666
Will you tell me about Manderley?
I hear it's beautiful.

200
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,666
It is. Yeah. Manderley,
it's more than a house. It's my life.

201
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,791
It's been passed from father to son
and father to son for centuries.

202
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,791
Until now, anyway.

203
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,250
You see, if I die without an heir,
it goes to my sister.

204
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:27,166
And her sons are nice boys,
but they're just not de Winters.

205
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,416
- [Maxim exhales]
- [Mademoiselle chuckles]

206
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,375
There we go.

207
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,083
Well, thank you
for getting us home safely.

208
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,750
Don't forget your things.

209
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,250
Sir, give us a hand?

210
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,041
This is what I need from you.

211
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,125
Would you grab that bag
and just lift at the same time?

212
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,333
One, two, three.

213
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,666
Put that back, please.

214
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,625
Yes, of course. I'm sorry. I...

215
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,625
Leave the keys with the valet. Good night.

216
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,583
[Mademoiselle] Good night.

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,291
[Mrs. Van Hopper weakly] Hello.

218
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,500
The nurse left an hour ago.

219
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,125
[stammers] The tennis coach only had
a late session free...

220
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,666
and I was practicing my serve.

221
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,291
A tennis lesson in the dark?

222
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,291
Yes.

223
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,708
[softly] Rebecca from Max.
Max from Rebecca.

224
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,708
You stupid girl.
Why would I look at his personal book?

225
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,208
[patrons chatting indistinctly]

226
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,500
For you. From <i>Monsieur</i> de Winter.

227
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,750
[Mademoiselle gasps] <i>Pour moi? Merci.</i>

228
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,875
- I'm off.
- [Mrs. Van Hopper] What have you got on?

229
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,541
I can see right through it.

230
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,500
Oh.

231
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,416
- You wearing any undergarments?
- Yes, of course.

232
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,125
I'm trying to paint beautiful houses.

233
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:07,583
Actually, you don't need
your tennis racket. All right.

234
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,250
[man] <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

235
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
<i>Merci.</i>

236
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,750
- [Mademoiselle] <i>What are you doing?</i>
- [Maxim] <i>Oh, you'll see.</i>

237
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,708
Imagine if you could
bottle a memory like scent.

238
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,833
Then, whenever you wanted,
you could open it.

239
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,458
It'd be like
living the moment all over again.

240
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,583
And what particular moments
in your young life would you bottle?

241
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,333
This week. Now. Every minute of it.

242
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,708
Never forget it.

243
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,041
And any memories you didn't want,
you could simply throw away.

244
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,958
[Mademoiselle] "Come for a drive."

245
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,250
"Lunch at the Cap."

246
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,125
The beach.

247
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,250
[Maxim] But I love the coast down here.

248
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,875
It's so beautiful.

249
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,916
Oh, there we go!

250
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,458
What are you looking at?

251
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,750
- Um, well, it's...
- Let me see.

252
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,625
I wouldn't if I were you.

253
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,958
No...
Well, it's just as well you're not...

254
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,875
- [gasps] Sorry.
- That's all right.

255
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,291
[Mademoiselle] Come on.
Let's go for a swim.

256
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,833
[chuckling] Come on. Come on!

257
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,125
- [shouts] Come in!
- No!

258
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,541
- [Mademoiselle] Why not?
- I don't want to!

259
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,185
[Mademoiselle] What are you afraid of?

260
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,458
It's too cold. No, it's freezing.

261
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,291
[Mademoiselle] No, it's not.
It's lovely!

262
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,958
[Maxim] I can feel it. It's freezing cold!

263
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,666
- You come here!
- No. I'm gonna drink all the champagne.

264
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,083
[Mademoiselle] I don't care!

265
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,416
[Maxim] God! Look
at what you're making me do.

266
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,416
[Mademoiselle laughs]

267
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,291
[soft piano music playing]

268
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,583
Oh, you're up.

269
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,708
I, um...

270
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,458
[stammering] I'm so glad
you're feeling better. Where's the nurse?

271
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,500
Dismissed.

272
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,125
Took a swim, I see. After tennis?

273
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,458
Yes.

274
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,625
Well, go on. Dry your hair. Chop-chop.

275
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,083
Are we going down for dinner?

276
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,666
I am.

277
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,250
You can see the concierge about
booking us on the early train tomorrow.

278
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,125
And you can set about packing.

279
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,291
Um, tomorrow?

280
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,875
Billy is sailing for New York on Saturday.
We can catch the same boat.

281
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sick to death of Europe.

282
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,541
[laughs]

283
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,583
Don't look at me like a drowned rat.

284
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,791
You'll get used to New York fast enough.

285
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,875
Plenty of boys and excitement.

286
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,333
All in your own class.

287
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,000
[sobbing]

288
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,791
[Mrs. Van Hopper] Did you
really think people wouldn't talk?

289
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,333
Oh, you're best out of it. Everyone knows
he nearly lost his mind after she died.

290
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,083
It was all too sudden and tragic.

291
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,291
[crying]

292
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,208
[Mrs. Van Hopper] Do you
honestly think he is in love with you?

293
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,166
<i>It was a distraction, dear. That's it.</i>

294
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,208
<i>We'll go away. We'll go to New York.</i>

295
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,458
<i>You'll find your way.</i>

296
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,000
You'll forget all about it.

297
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,291
Trust me, you will forget all about it.

298
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,625
[sniffling]

299
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,041
[knocking at door]

300
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,250
[Maxim] Just a moment.

301
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,041
[Mademoiselle breathing heavily]

302
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,875
Mrs. Van Hopper is leaving
and I have to go, too.

303
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,958
- [Maxim] What are you talking about?
- Now. Today.

304
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,166
I just wanted to say goodbye.

305
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,083
Why haven't you told me before?

306
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,083
Because she only decided it last night.

307
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:05,041
And we're going to Paris with...
to meet her nephew.

308
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,125
Then we go to Cherbourg
to sail to New York.

309
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:11,166
All right. Listen, you mustn't cry.
Just give me a moment to think.

310
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,250
I...

311
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,791
I can't stay long.
She's expecting me downstairs.

312
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,708
Come with me.

313
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:23,791
What?

314
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,416
To Manderley.

315
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,875
What? As your secretary?

316
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,833
No. No.

317
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,375
As my wife.

318
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,583
I'm asking you
to marry me, you little fool.

319
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,541
I can't come to Manderley.

320
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,791
Yes, you can.
You said you wanted to see the world.

321
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,958
Manderley is the best part of it.

322
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,916
Of course she's down there.
Where else is she?

323
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,750
I've got to leave
in 20 minutes to catch the train.

324
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,900
- I'll tell her.
- Do we have to go?

325
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,250
Yes, we do.
I'm actually looking forward to this.

326
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,958
That's exactly what I'm waiting for.

327
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,333
Now, don't worry.

328
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,833
- [knocking at door]
- [scoffs]

329
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,041
Who is this now?

330
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,208
[laughing] This is the most wonderful news
I've ever heard in my life!

331
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,142
Wait till I tell my friends,
I can't believe it!

332
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,291
What are the plans?
I must know everything.

333
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,291
The plans are settled.

334
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,291
We'll marry here,
and honeymoon in Europe.

335
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,375
And then home to Manderley.

336
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,875
Oh, my goodness. Have you ever heard
of anything more romantic?

337
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,208
- "Home to Manderley."
- Mmm.

338
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,411
[chuckling] Oh, my goodness.
It's out of a fairy tale.

339
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:43,875
All right. I'll go and make sure
your bags don't end up on the train.

340
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,375
- [Mrs. Van Hopper] Ah! Do hurry.
- You'll be fine.

341
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:50,166
[Mrs. Van Hopper chuckling] Yes, go along.
We have lots to talk about.

342
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,666
[door closes]

343
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,291
Well, goodness gracious,
don't you work quickly?

344
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,708
Have you been doing things you shouldn't?

345
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,875
- I don't know what you mean.
- [chuckles]

346
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,500
Well, you don't have a family,
luckily, to explain it to.

347
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,083
I wash my hands of it.

348
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,833
Gonna have your work cut out for you
at Manderley.

349
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,875
And, frankly,
I don't think you're up to it.

350
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,625
- I can learn.
- Let me tell you something, honey.

351
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:24,416
When you trap a man between your legs,
they don't stick around for long.

352
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,083
Goodbye, Mrs. Van Hopper.

353
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:33,250
He's only marrying you
because he doesn't want to go on living

354
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,416
in that big old house with her ghost!

355
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,833
I don't believe in ghosts.

356
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,458

[Maxim] Oh, God.
I hate it when they do this.

367
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,750
So much for keeping things quiet.

368
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,166
You know how she is, sir.

369
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,041
There's a way
things are done at Manderley.

370
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,615
[Maxim] Darling, this is Frith.

371
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:03,083
- [Mrs. de Winter] Hello.
- [Frith grunts]

372
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,000
[Maxim] Let's do things
properly, shall we? There we go.

373
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,708
- What are you doing?
- What? You don't like that?

374
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,625
- Up you go.
- [Mrs. de Winter shrieks]

377

[Mrs. de Winter] Max, put me down.

378
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,625
[kissing]

379
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,776
[Mrs. de Winter clears throat] Oh.

380
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,666
Mrs. Danvers.

381
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,208
Welcome to Manderley.

382
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,333
Hello. It's a pleasure. Oh!

383
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,458
- Thank you. Thank you.
- [Mrs. Danvers] Tea is ready.

384
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:12,000
[Maxim] Danvers runs the house. Don't
worry, she's not as scary as she seems.

385
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,375
[Mrs. de Winter]
Oh, Maxim, it's wonderful!

386
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,375
[barking]

387
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,541
Stop that.

388
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,583
There he is. The wanderer returns.
Good to see you, Max.

389
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,625
- And you, Frank.
- How was the trip?

390
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,791
Was rather eventful, as it turns out.

391
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,166
- Frank Crawley, Mrs. de Winter.
- It's a pleasure.

392
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,500
Thank you. Hello.

393
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,291
[Maxim] Frank's the estate manager.

394
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,935
The place would fall apart without him.

395
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,250
Ah, no, no. He exaggerates.
Ignore him. [chuckles softly]

396
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:45,500
I hate to be a bore,
but I urgently need a few signatures.

397
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,083
I'll have him back to you in a jiffy.

398
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,500
- Shall we?
- Yes.

399
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,916
Oh, uh...

400
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,625
Danvers, show Mrs. de Winter the house.
Can you?

401
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,375
Oh, that's all right. I'll wait.

402
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:02,708
No, don't be silly.
Go on. I'll catch you up.

403
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,166
[sighs]

404
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,958
[Mrs. Danvers] The estate has been
in the family for over 300 years.

405
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,875
It was originally a gift from Henry VIII.

406
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,541
[Mrs. de Winter] Extraordinary.

407
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,642
[Mrs. Danvers] If there are guests,
you may use the drawing room.

408
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,583
Don't forget to tell Frith
to light the fires,

409
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:35,375
but generally, Mr. de Winter prefers
to take his coffee here in the library.

410
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:41,041
Glad you're here, Mrs. Danvers.
I'll never remember all this.

411
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49,500
Oh, I'm sure you won't disappoint him,
madam, if that's your concern.

412
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,916
<i>The de Winter family
dates back to the Tudors.</i>

413
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,666
[Mrs. de Winter] And, um, who's that?

414
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:59,791
[chuckles] That's Caroline de Winter.
Mr. de Winter's great aunt.

415
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,355
[Mrs. de Winter] She's very striking.

416
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:05,666
Yes, and one of the first women
to qualify as a doctor in England.

417
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,875
It's one of his favorites.

418
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,388
[Mrs. de Winter]
Where does everyone sleep?

419
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:16,041
Maids in the attic, men below stairs,
as in your other houses, I presume.

420
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,083
Never even seen a house like this.

421
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,083
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd been a lady's maid.

422
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,583
The master bedroom
is now in the east wing.

423
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,208
[clears throat]

424
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,291
What a... pretty pattern.

425
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:53,291
This is Clarice. She'll look after you
until your maid gets here.

426
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:57,333
I don't have a maid,
but I'm sure I'll manage without one.

427
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,708
Well, I think you'll find you need one.

428
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,500
Perhaps Clarice could take the position.

429
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:09,500
Oh! You can't see the sea from here.

430
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,958
No, you can't.

431
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,166
Should Mr. de Winter
ask for his old wardrobe,

432
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,500
I'm afraid you must tell him
it wouldn't fit here.

433
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,583
The rooms in this wing are much smaller.

434
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,416
This wasn't his bedroom before?

435
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,083
Oh, no. No. Mrs. de Winter's rooms
were in the west wing.

436
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:33,458
Well, it's a lovely room.
Much too nice to stand empty.

437
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,500
The guest rooms
are never empty for very long.

438
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,625
We entertained a lot
when the late Mrs. de Winter was alive.

439
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
The Manderley ball was quite an event.

440
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,208
I'll leave you with Clarice.

441
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,500
[Mrs. de Winter] <i>Ask me a question.</i>

442
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,041
[Maxim] <i>What sort of question?</i>

443
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,166
[Mrs. de Winter sighs] <i>Anything.</i>

444
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,041
<i>I have no secrets from you.</i>

445
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,708
<i>Don't you think that's how it should be
now that we're married?</i>

446
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,916
[Maxim] <i>All marriages have their secrets.</i>

447
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:26,333
You can talk to me about her...
if you want.

448
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,208
Good night, darling.

449
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,166
- [Mrs. de Winter grunts]
- [faint clattering]

450
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:25,666
[wind whistling]

451
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,458
[grunts]

452
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,541
[breathing rapidly]

453
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,750
[footsteps falling]

454
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,125
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim?

455
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,958
- [Mrs. Danvers] Leave him.
- [yelps]

456
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,125
It's dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.

457
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,458
And nothing to worry about,
but the stables will need reroofing

458
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,500
because the tiles are spoiled...

459
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,791
[Maxim] Hmm.

460
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,833
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning.

461
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,708
- [Maxim] Sleep well?
- Yes, not bad.

462
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Come.

463
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,833
- How are you settling in?
- Very well, thank you.

464
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,041
Good. Good.

465
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:14,583
I'll... [clears throat]
see you up there, shall I?

466
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,583
- Won't be a sec.
- Mrs. de Winter.

467
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:17,666
Oh, Mr. Crawley.

468
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,000
Frank. It's Frank.

469
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,535
I should have got up earlier.

470
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,500
- We could have had breakfast together.
- Oh, that's all right.

471
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,500
Did you know you sleepwalk?

472
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,708
Enjoy your breakfast.

473
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,375
[servants giggling]

474
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,500
[dog barking]

475
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,041
- [Mrs. de Winter] Jasper!
- [barking]

476
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Where are you going? Jasper!

477
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,083
[whispers] Jasper, where have you gone?

478
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,416
- [shatters]
- [gasps]

479
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:20,375
[dog growls softly]

480
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,000
[exclaims] Ow!

481
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,333
[indistinct chatter]

482
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,125
I'm sorry to disturb you all...

483
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,916
Clarice, have you seen Mr. de Winter?

484
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,458
Do you have a plaster?
I've cut my hand.

485
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:06,583
[Clarice] Let me see.

486
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:09,500
- Really, it's nothing. I'm fine.
- Oh, my. One moment.

487
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:14,916
Since you're here, madam, may I have
your approval for today's menus?

488
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,083
[clears throat] Oh.

489
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,750
Yes. Good.
Very suitable. Very nice indeed.

490
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:23,916
- And the sauce for the roast veal?
- Yes, that looks excellent.

491
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,541
No, but I've left it blank, you see?

492
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,750
Mrs. de Winter was
most particular about her sauces.

493
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Right. Well, um...

494
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:35,958
Uh...

495
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,333
We'll have whatever Mrs. de Winter
would have had.

496
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,416
Very well, madam.

497
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,166
- There we go.
- Thank you very much.

498
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,416
[door opens]

499
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,541
[Maxim] Is everything all right, darling?

500
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:26,583
I was thinking of... ordering some
new undergarments from London.

501
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,916
Something lacy and a nightgown.

502
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:36,375
When have I ever complained
about what you wear?

503
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:48,041
[Mrs. de Winter] This is nice, isn't it?
Just us.

504
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,750
It's almost like
we're back on our honeymoon.

505
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:57,291
Oh, I miss it. Don't you?
Driving, the exploring, little cafes?

506
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,041
[sighs] Seeing some funny old hotel
and just staying there.

507
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,125
[Maxim] That's not real life, darling.

508
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:05,791
[barking]

509
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,083
- [shouts] Jasper! Jasper!
- I'll get him.

510
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,958
[Maxim] No, just leave him.
He'll find his own way back.

511
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:12,791
It's so steep. What if he falls?

512
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,166
I said leave him!

513
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:18,833
[Mrs. de Winter] Jasper!

514
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:21,583
Jasper!

515
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:24,875
Jasper, come here!

516
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,583
Jasper!

517
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:32,666
[barks]

518
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,750
Jasper!

519
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:46,333
Jasper, come out of there.

520
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,708
[door creaks]

521
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,125
[Jasper growling faintly]

522
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,166
Jasper, come here.

523
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,250
[growls]

524
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,291
All right, get something to tie you with.

525
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,625
[growls]

526
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,958
[barks]

527
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,041
Hello?

528
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,583
- There's nothing here, silly. Hey!
- [barks]

529
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:18,791
I'm...

530
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,708
I didn't realize that anyone lived here.

531
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:24,791
No, I don't, do I?
Live up in the keeper's cottage.

532
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,750
I've been digging
for shells since forenoon.

533
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,458
Oh, you've been digging for shells? Huh?

534
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,291
Um...

535
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,041
No. I just, I...

536
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,541
I needed something to tie my dog with.
I'll be out of your way.

537
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,541
- He ain't yourn.
- Oh, no.

538
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,166
- He's Mr. de Winter's dog.
- No.

539
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,875
That's her dog.

540
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,833
She don't come here no more.

541
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,458
She... she gone into the sea, ain't she?

542
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,416
She drowned.

543
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,250
You ain't like her.

544
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:07,875
Yes. Come on, Jasper.

545
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:11,208
I never said nothin', did I?

546
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,125
Come on, Jasper. Come on.

547
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,125
I know why you didn't want
to come down here.

548
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,041
How am I supposed to know?

549
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:36,166
How am I supposed to know anything
if you don't tell me?

550
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,791
- [Maxim] That's supposed to be locked.
- Someone was in there.

551
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:43,041
[Maxim] Probably just the keeper's son,
Ben. He's harmless enough.

552
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,291
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim, I...

553
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,208
[thunder rumbling]

554
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,541
[indistinct laughter]

555
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,875
[Beatrice] Oh, God!

556
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,267
- [Mrs. de Winter] That's in Italy.
- [Beatrice] There he is.

557
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:17,875
[Mrs. de Winter] Oh, yes.
That was just after the wedding.

558
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,708
What a nice plain frock.

559
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:26,375
Look, Max was right.
You're not at all what I expected.

560
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,500
And you're looking better, old man.

561
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,708
Not so drawn.

562
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,458
- Please.
- Bosh!

563
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:35,750
Everyone knows you were
a perfect wreck six months ago.

564
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:39,541
Here, Granny, have you seen these?

565
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:41,666
- Look, aren't they lovely?
- [Granny] Ah.

566
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,458
[Beatrice] Goodness! Yes.

567
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,666
[Mrs. de Winter] So,
these were from our wedding.

568
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,958
[Beatrice] What's all this
I hear about you not hunting?

569
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,333
Oh, no, I'm afraid I don't ride.

570
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,625
Oh, but you must!
Or you'll miss out on all the fun.

571
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,166
Come and stay. I can teach you.

572
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,041
Finest horsewoman in the county.

573
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,708
Do dry up, Giles.

574
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:03,416
It might shock my sister
that not everyone shares her idea of fun.

575
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,125
Whatever her idea of fun,
she certainly deserves to have some.

576
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:11,375
Well, actually, I've been
thinking I might revive the ball.

577
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,500
- [Giles] Huh.
- Oh!

578
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,666
Hmm, what a marvelous idea.

579
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,291
That's not something we discussed.

580
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,333
[Beatrice] Oh,
don't be so damn miserable.

581
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,333
You used to love it.

582
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,458
You can hold it
in honor of your new bride.

583
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,541
Fine.

584
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,875
Well, that's settled, then.

585
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,708
- To our new hostess.
- Yeah. To our new hostess.

586
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,000
Are you staying at Manderley, dear?

587
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:46,456
[Beatrice] She lives here.

588
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,166
- [Giles] Remember, Granny?
- [Beatrice] Granny, we introduced you.

589
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,166
She's Maxim's wife.

590
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,666
[chuckling] No, she is not.

591
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:57,708
[chuckling]

592
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,333
[chuckling] She's not Maxim's wife.

593
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:10,041
[chuckling] What a silly notion.

594
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:15,250
Uh, well, it's...
good news about the ball, uh...

595
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,541
It's been far too long.

596
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,583
I don't remember you.

597
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,958
Oh, no, I...

598
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,916
[loudly] We haven't met before.

599
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:29,625
- Maxim, who is this child?
- Ow!

600
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,500
- [Giles] Oh, Christ.
- [Maxim] All right, let's get Granny home.

601
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,750
[Granny] What have
you done with Rebecca?

602
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,541
- [Beatrice] Leave it.
- No, I've got it!

603
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,465
[Granny] I want to see Rebecca.
Leave me alone!

604
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,166
[Giles] She just gets a little...
it's the time of day, and the weather...

605
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,053
- [Beatrice] Oh, my! Get her in the car.
- [Granny] I just want to...

606
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,666
[Giles] You go and talk to her.

607
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,750
Let's get in the car, Granny. Come on.

608
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,958
[Clarice] This is from the flower room.
I hope that's all right.

609
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,761
- [Mrs. de Winter] Thank you.
- I apologize.

610
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:59,166
I'd forgotten how fond
our grandmother was of Rebecca.

611
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,333
I'm fine.

612
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:03,708
She was just
one of those bloody annoying people.

613
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:09,666
Irresistible to everybody. The men, women,
children, animals. [chuckles]

614
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,583
Us mere mortals couldn't hope to compete.

615
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:23,375
[engine starts]

616
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,041
[thunder rumbling]

617
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,375
- [Frith] Sir.
- [Maxim] Why is he crying?

618
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,666
[Frith] Sir, one of the porcelain pieces
is missing from the morning room,

619
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,083
and now Danvers
is calling for the boy's dismissal.

620
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,446
- But it wasn't...
- Which piece?

621
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,541
We're not sure, sir.

622
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:56,416
Danvers!

623
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,000
- Is everything all right?
- [Maxim] Yes, it's fine.

624
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,708
Something's just gone missing
from the morning room.

625
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,833
- Danvers!
- What is it? What's gone missing?

626
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:10,541
What makes you think Robert took it?

627
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,583
The Dresden is extremely valuable, sir.

628
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,017
- But it wasn't me!
- [Mrs. Danvers] That piece is worth £100.

629
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:19,001
- [Frith] Sir, I find it most unlikely...
- [Mrs. Danvers] Then who, Frith?

630
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:23,000
The between maid isn't allowed
in the morning room. I do it.

631
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,750
When Mrs. de Winter
was alive, we did it together.

632
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:27,833
- [Maxim] All Frith is saying...
- It was me.

633
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,916
I broke it. It broke.

634
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,083
It was an accident. It fell.

635
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,958
Well, there we go.

636
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:46,208
Robert, you're off the hook.

637
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,416
[sniffles]

638
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,041
Where are the pieces, madam?

639
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,958
In the bureau drawer at the back.

640
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,916
Send them to London.
See if anything can be done.

641
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,200
[Mrs. Danvers] Certainly, sir.

642
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,625
And may I suggest,
should anything like this happen again,

643
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,500
that Mrs. de Winter tell me herself.

644
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:09,708
[Maxim] If we're all quite finished?

645
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
[sobs]

646
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,958
[exclaims angrily]

647
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:23,791
[dog barking]

648
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,708
[grunts]

649
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,375
[footsteps approaching]

650
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:07,375
Oh, Frank.

651
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,166
Mrs. de Winter.

652
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,625
I thought you'd
gone up to London with Max.

653
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:14,416
He's in London?

654
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,833
Yeah. Taking care of some paperwork.

655
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,458
He asked me to put a padlock on.
I nearly locked you in.

656
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:24,166
It's a shame.

657
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,500
This place going to ruin.

658
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:32,458
Well... no boat now.

659
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,583
Max doesn't like to sail.

660
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,416
Ben said she drowned.

661
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,166
I'm sorry. I assumed you knew.

662
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,333
- No.
- Ah, it's...

663
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:04,416
It was brutal weather.

664
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:08,125
Even for her. She was an excellent sailor.

665
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,083
The boat went down.

666
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,000
They never recovered it.

667
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:17,833
She washed up
in Edgcumbe some... two months later.

668
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:21,416
Two months? My God!

669
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:23,791
Poor Maxim.

670
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,916
Drove him down there myself
to identify the body.

671
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:33,375
You know, you really
mustn't dwell on the past.

672
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,958
You're so good for Max.
He's a changed man.

673
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,666
She must have been so afraid.

674
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,666
Out there alone.

675
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,666
She wasn't afraid of anything.

676
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:57,083
Can I ask you something, Frank?
And promise to tell me the truth.

677
00:53:57,166 --> 00:54:00,750
[chuckles] Hardly fair.
Don't know what you're gonna ask me.

678
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,166
Was Rebecca very beautiful?

679
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,375
Yes.

680
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,083
Yes, I suppose she was...

681
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:18,416
the most beautiful
creature I ever saw in my life.

682
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,666
[dramatic music playing]

683
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,375
- [perfume spritzes]
- [inhales]

684
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:16,205
- [Mrs. Danvers] It is beautiful, isn't it?
- [gasps]

685
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,833
I keep it just the way it was.

686
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,625
It's as if she'd just
gone out for a while.

687
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:26,041
You startled me.

688
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,541
This was her favorite.

689
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,458
I laid it out for her that night.

690
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:44,041
Go on, hold it.

691
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:46,625
Touch it.

692
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:56,583
She wouldn't have a lady's maid, you know.
"I don't want anyone but you, Danny."

693
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,666
Do you see how tall she was?

694
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:08,458
Hmm. She could wear
anything with a figure like hers.

695
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,875
I'd brush her hair for her every evening.

696
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,625
"Come on, Danny, hair drill," she'd say.

697
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,750
I'd stand behind her...

698
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:28,291
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

699
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,916
That great mass of dark hair.

700
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,750
He joined in.

701
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:42,541
He loved to do that for her.

702
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,583
They'd be dressing for dinner,
guests waiting downstairs.

703
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:50,500
"Harder, Max, harder!" [laughs]

704
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,833
And he'd roar with laughter.

705
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:56,791
He was always laughing back then.

706
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,250
Does he brush your hair?

707
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,791
No.

708
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:14,791
Mrs. Danvers, does Mr. de Winter
ask you to keep the room like this?

709
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:16,291
He doesn't have to.

710
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,750
She's still here.

711
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,833
Can you feel her?

712
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:26,833
I wonder what she's thinking about you.

713
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:31,416
Taking her husband and... using her name.

714
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:36,750
- I'm sure she'd want him to be happy.
- Happy?

715
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,541
No, he'll never be happy.

716
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,541
She was the love of his life.

717
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:05,916
- [footsteps falling]
- [muttering]

718
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,250
[gasping]

719
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,250
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim?

720
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:19,708
- [vines rustling]
- [Mrs. de Winter yelps]

721
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:31,625
[grunts]

722
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,958
Good morning, madam.

723
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:38,333
- [breathing heavily]
- Oh, dear! You've been scratchin'.

724
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
[whimpers]

725
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,000
[exhales heavily]

726
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:04,041
[dogs barking]

727
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:17,750
[Favell] Have we missed ya?

728
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:25,541
Hello! You must be the new Mrs. de Winter.

729
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:27,916
Uh, I think there's been a mistake.

730
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,291
- Mr. de Winter's in London.
- He's left you on your own?

731
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:34,541
Isn't he afraid some bounder
might come and carry you off?

732
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,458
I'm Jack Favell. How do you do?

733
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,291
[laughs nervously]

734
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,208
Um...

735
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,250
Well, did you want to leave your card?

736
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,500
- And too polite to tell me to bugger off.
- [scoffs]

737
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:50,000
You are a sweetheart.

738
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,791
Not to worry.
I just popped by to see Danny.

739
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:54,625
She's invited me for tea.

740
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:58,583
- I'm horribly early, though.
- Mrs. Danvers?

741
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:01,416
That's why I thought
I'd better hover around out here,

742
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,791
otherwise I might
get a smack on the wrist.

743
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:07,166
[horse neighing]

744
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,416
Mr. Favell? Where are you going?

745
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,708
- [horse neighing]
- [Favell] Charlie, come on.

746
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:17,684
- Excuse me, Mr. Favell!
- [Charlie] Coming, sir.

747
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:18,708
[horse neighing]

748
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:20,958
Phillippa! Come on in, Charlie.

749
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:23,833
- [Charlie] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stand down.
- [neighing]

750
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,416
- [Favell] Easy, Starlight.
- Steady.

751
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,916
[Favell chuckling] You've too much energy.
They've been neglecting you.

752
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,041
That's not a surprise.

753
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,583
Rebecca was the only one
who could handle you, wasn't she, old boy?

754
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,666
Yes.

755
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,458
You knew Rebecca?

756
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,000
She's my cousin. Was.

757
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,583
[Charlie] That's it.

758
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,875
Let's take one of the horses
out for a turn.

759
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,791
Oh, no. I really... I don't know how.

760
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:53,833
Well, I can teach you.
Or have you something better to be doing?

761
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,666
- How do I...
- On three, swing your leg over.

762
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,184
- Ready?
- [Mrs. de Winter] Do you...

763
01:00:58,208 --> 01:00:59,541
[Favell] One, two, three.

764
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,208
[grunts]

765
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:04,375
- Can you give me a stirrup? All right.
- All right.

766
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,541
[gasps] Are you...

767
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:10,375
- We won't go too fast. [clicks tongue]
- [horse snorts]

768
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:16,791
[Favell] That's it.

769
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,875
How do you feel?

770
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,000
- Right, now you take the reins.
- Oh, all right.

771
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,166
- Be nice and loose.
- Yeah.

772
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,791
And low. That's it.

773
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:33,791
- Got it.
- Right here on your lap.

774
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:37,625
Now, very important. Squeeze the thighs.

You're gonna be
wickedly sore this evening.

777
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:46,125
- Now just move with me. Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

778

Has Max ever talked to you
about the accident?

782
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:01,541
And he never mentioned
Rebecca's trip to London that day?

783
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:03,833
No.

784
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:07,083
No, he won't speak of it at all.

785
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,666
So, you don't know if he saw her
when she got back that night,

786
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,583
before she took the boat out?

787

No.

788

[Favell] Hmm.

789
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,333
There's something she wanted to tell me.

790
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,791
Something very important.

791
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,750
And not knowing what it was...

794

I'm not doing
my roguish image any good, am I?

795
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:53,458
You should come back and ask Maxim.

796
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:54,958
Well, I would.

797
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,250
But I'm afraid I'm a little bit banned
from visiting.

798
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,166
In fact, it's best if you don't mention
my being here at all today.

799
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,750
I... I thought you were friends.

800
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:09,750
Not really, no.

801
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:16,875
And I would hate for either one of us

802
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,708
to be on the receiving end
of that famous temper of his.

803

Jack Favell.

810
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,458
You asked him for tea,

811

has banned him from the property.

There must be some mistake, madam.

813
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:23,958
I haven't seen Mr. Favell for over a year.

814
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:56,625
[Maxim] Hello, Frith.

815
01:04:56,708 --> 01:05:00,166
[Frith whispers] Hello, sir. Mr. Favell
has made an unannounced visit.

816
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:07,001
[Mrs. de Winter] <i>I don't care
what she told Frith!</i>

[shakily] <i>Mr. Favell told me
that she invited him here.</i>

818
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:13,750
And I suppose Mrs. Danvers forced you
to go riding with him, did she?

819
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,166
No, I can explain!

820

- Explain what?
- I was going to tell you, I was.

821
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:21,541
Want to tell me how you
dragged him down to the boathouse?

822
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:26,166
Parade your
fancy new night clothes for him?

823

[crying] How could you even think that?

824
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:33,250
I'd never have let him on the property
if I'd known it would upset you, Maxim.

Please. I love you.

Oh, do you?

Mrs. Danvers invited him here.

I've come to give you your notice.

834
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,875
Has Mr. de Winter agreed to this?

835
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,333
The decision is mine.

836
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:36,958
[Mrs. Danvers] You see...

837
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,500
I looked after Rebecca
when she was a little girl.

838
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,333
We came here together
when she was first married.

839
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:49,750
I was her friend.

840
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:54,083
Someone to share her secrets.

841
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,583
Bond like that can't be broke.

842
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:02,541
Can't be replaced.
I was wrong to expect that from you.

843
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:09,166
Well, you'll find another house.

No.

We women, we can either marry
or go into service,

847

and I'm too old for either.

848

Well, we'll make sure
that you're provided for.

849
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,375
Oh, it's not about money. It's...

850
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:32,916
This wasn't a job for me.
Rebecca was my life.

851
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:37,541
Yes.

852

I'm sorry if I failed you.

hoped that you'd help me.

not picked out what to wear yet, and...

Had to get it moved.

- No, no, for this.
- [laughing]

934

But I wear it every year, mate.

935
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,958
All right. Finally. Hey, here she comes.

[drum roll stops]

937

[laughs nervously]

939

Is this some kind of joke?

940
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:42,750
Of course not.
It's the painting. I thought...

941
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:43,875
[Maxim] Go and change.

942
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,791
What is it? What have I...

943
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,750
Go and change now.

944
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,125
I don't understand.

945
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:56,333
- What have I done wrong?
- I said now!

I'm sorry. Please, madam, I never knew.

949
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:15,750
It was Mrs. Danvers' idea.

950
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:27,250
Rebecca wore this before, didn't she?

951
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:33,291
[crying] Mrs. Danvers said he'd be
so pleased and you'd be so pleased.

952
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:41,625
Hold that.

953
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:47,041
- That's most unfortunate.
- It was uncanny, wasn't it?

[sighs]

955
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:58,291
- No, I can't.
- Oh, bosh! Darling, you have to.

956
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:00,166
No.

957

It's not as bad as all that.

958
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:08,333
You don't understand, I can't.
Not after this. Not after what I've done.

959
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:10,250
How were you to know?

960
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:14,333
Now, wash your face, and I'll find you
something to wear, all right?

961
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:16,666
[voice breaking] I should've known.

962
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,875
- I should never have worn it.
- Pull yourself together.

963
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:22,625
You can sit up here all night
feeling sorry for yourself,

964
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:26,750
or you can come downstairs with me
and have a good old laugh about it, hmm?

965

His face...

966
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,291
He wouldn't have spoken like that to her.

967
01:16:41,541 --> 01:16:45,541
You're very different people,
and that's nothing to be ashamed of.

968
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:49,125
- Okay.
- Come on.

- Oh, yes.

This'll do.

972

I'll be all right.

Good show.

- Yes.

- Yes.

- [chuckles] Yes.
- Oh, never mind.

982
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:52,958
You look lovely,

983
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:56,083
and far more comfortable
than I am in this ridiculous getup.

984
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:58,291
Oh, don't be silly, darling.
You look divine.

985
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:02,458
- Maxim, I...
- This whole idea was a mistake.

01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,666
Her boat was damaged.

1088
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:12,000
I damaged it.

1089
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:14,916
Deliberately.

1090
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Oh, Maxim.

1091
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:22,291
You didn't know her.

1092
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:24,791
Nobody did.

1093
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:30,208
She told me on our honeymoon
how it would be.

1094
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,875
How she would keep her flat in London.

1095
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:36,958
Her parade of men. Even her own cousin.

1096
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:38,916
Please, Maxim!

1097
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:43,500
She relished it. Playing the part.

1098
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:48,125
The perfect wife,
knowing that I would never divorce her.

1099
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,791
'Cause you loved her.

1100
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:55,291
I hated her.

1101
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:59,333
Hated her cruelty.

1102
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,750
I hated my cowardice.

1103
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:09,041
Knowing that I wouldn't divorce her.
Knowing I could never do that to our name.

1104
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:17,750
How did she die?

1105
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,833
When she came back from London,

1106
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:22,458
she told me
she was expecting a visit from Favell.

1107
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:25,416
When I got here, she was alone.

1108
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,208
She looked different. She was pale.

1109
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:30,416
She'd seen a doctor in London.

1110
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:36,041
She said, "Imagine if I had a child, Max.
You could never prove it wasn't yours."

1111
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:39,041
See, it wasn't enough
for her to take my pride.

1112
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:43,833
She wanted to take
my name, my home, everything.

1113
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:48,166
And she said, "Go on, Max, do it."

1114
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:52,041
"All you have to do is
pull the trigger and you'll be free."

1115
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:55,375
Please.

1116
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:07,250
[breathing heavily]

1117
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:20,791
Bullet went straight through her.

1118
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:24,208
She didn't fall right away.
She just stood there.

1119
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,208
So calm.

1120
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:28,916
Almost relieved.

1121
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,583
And then she was gone.

1122
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:39,750
All this time
I thought you still loved Rebecca.

1123
01:29:50,916 --> 01:29:51,916
[gasps softly]

1124
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:06,041
Why didn't you tell me?

1125
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,250
I couldn't.

1126
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:20,458
I was so afraid I'd have lost you.

1127
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:25,833
Go to the police, tell them everything.

1128
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:30,291
You didn't know. Nothing'll happen to you.

1129
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:36,583
I understand
if you want nothing more to do with me.

1130
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:39,166
That's your choice.

1131
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:48,000
You made a mistake...
identifying the body.

1132
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It was the grief, the trauma.

1133
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:55,125
Nobody knows but us.
Nobody will ever know.

1134
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:59,083
No, she hasn't won, Maxim.

1135
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:01,000
She hasn't won.

1136
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,000
We won't let her.

1137
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:26,583
You don't have to speak to them.

1138
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:29,333
[man] <i>All stand
for the Right Honorable James Crouch.</i>

1139
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:32,833
[reporters clamoring]

1140
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,500
[Frank] Stand back.

1141
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:37,125
[coroner] <i>Order! Settle down.</i>

1142
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,458
<i>This is the... Sit down, sir.</i>

1143
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,875
<i>This is the coroner's inquest</i>

1144
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:45,000
<i>into the discovery
of the body of Rebecca de Winter.</i>

1145
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:48,250
<i>This is not
currently a criminal proceeding.</i>

1146
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:51,416
We are here
only to ascertain how Mrs. de Winter died.

1147
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:55,833
The court will now hear from
Detective Welch of the Kerrith police.

1148
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:57,625
Detective Welch.

1149
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:02,958
The body
Mr. de Winter identified last year...

1150
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,083
was not his wife.

1151
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,958
In fact, Rebecca de Winter's body
was recovered from the cabin of her boat.

1152
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,000
That troubled me.

1153
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:15,458
As did the nature
of the damage to the vessel.

1154
01:32:15,541 --> 01:32:17,291
And what was that nature?

1155
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:19,666
We found four holes below the waterline

1156
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:22,291
consistent with those
made by a ship's gaff.

1157
01:32:23,458 --> 01:32:25,333
- Or spike.
- Suggesting what?

1158
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:27,125
That the boat was deliberately scuttled.

1159
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,708
[indistinct murmuring]

1160
01:32:28,791 --> 01:32:31,166
In my opinion, Mr. Coroner,

1161
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:34,041
this inquest can return
one of only two verdicts.

1162
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:38,541
Suicide or unlawful killing.

1163
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:47,291
[coroner] <i>Your wife made a trip
to London the day she died.</i>

1164
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,250
It's time.

1165
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:52,833
In your statement to the police,
you say your wife seemed

1166
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:55,958
"preoccupied and unhappy"
when she returned.

1167
01:32:56,666 --> 01:32:58,833
Don't be defensive.
Answer their questions calmly.

1168
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,250
[coroner] What was the purpose
of her trip?

1169
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,041
No idea.

1170
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:05,750
[coroner] Was it normal for your wife

1171
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:08,291
not to discuss such matters
with her husband?

1172
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:10,666
Are you implying
there were problems in my marriage?

1173
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:14,000
I'm trying to understand
how you apparently failed

1174
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:16,208
to recognize your own wife last year.

1175
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:19,125
She'd been two months at sea.
She drifted 20 miles.

1176
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,583
She was bloated, decomposing,

1177
01:33:20,666 --> 01:33:23,333
her arms ripped off, `
and there was nothing left of her face.

1178
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:24,416
[audience clamoring]

1179
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:27,291
- [coroner] Order! Order!
- [banging gavel]

1180
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:34,208
[Maxim] <i>I was arrogant and stupid.</i>

1181
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:38,375
- I lost my nerve.
- [Mrs. de Winter] No, you were passionate.

1182
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,166
They'll believe it.

1183
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:43,583
Who else knows she saw a doctor in London?

1184
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:48,333
You, me, and the doctor.

1185
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:51,875
They're not likely
to find any physical evidence.

1186
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,541
Not after so long at sea.

1187
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,666
The doctor is all they have.

1188
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:08,333
I did tell Mr. Favell
he wasn't welcome, but he insisted.

1189
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:10,625
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

1190
01:34:12,916 --> 01:34:14,625
What the hell do you want?

1191
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:20,166
Another whiskey and soda would be nice.

1192
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:23,041
It's about Rebecca,

1193
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:25,166
so you might want
to send your wife off to bed.

1194
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:28,083
I'm not going anywhere.
I know all about you and Rebecca.

1195
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:29,791
Oh, really?

1196
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:32,708
You know all about that, do you?

1197
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,833
You were close, Favell.

1198
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:37,833
If I'd caught you here
that night with her...

1199
01:34:37,916 --> 01:34:39,208
He was never here that night.

1200
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:40,625
But she did invite me.

1201
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,500
And that's the point.

1202
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:48,500
Suicide or foul play,
that's what the chap said, wasn't it?

1203
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:52,666
Now, inviting someone over...

1204
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:55,666
doesn't really sound like
the sort of thing one would do

1205
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:58,375
if one was planning to end it all,
does it?

1206
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:03,208
And that's what's been
driving me mad this last year.

1207
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:06,708
But it's beginning to make sense.

1208
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:12,250
She finally decided to leave you.
Is that why you killed her?

1209
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:17,416
You've no proof.
It's your word against mine.

1210
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,500
No.

1211
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:23,208
It's your word against Rebecca's.

1212
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:27,833
"Come to Manders when you get this.

1213
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:29,750
I've something to tell you

1214
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:33,791
and I want to see you
as soon as possible. Rebecca."

1215
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,208
[Mrs. de Winter] Let me see.

1216
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:39,476
- [Maxim] Get out of my house.
- Don't rise to it, Maxim.

1217
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,541
[chuckling] Yes. Don't rise to it, Max.

1218
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:45,416
I only came by to thank you, really.

1219
01:35:46,291 --> 01:35:49,125
You've been so generous over the years,

1220
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:51,916
sharing your wife
with so many of us chaps.

1221
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:56,416
Actually, I wondered
if I might try my luck with the new one.

1222
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:01,541
[Favell] There's that temper
I told you about.

1223
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:03,958
How much do you want?

1224
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:08,750
She's cleverer than she looks, this one,
isn't she?

1225
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:12,208
Seems to be a spot of blood.

1226
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,250
Oh, dearie me.

1227
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:18,750
[groans]

1228
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:22,333
She's right, though.

1229
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:25,333
I'm not a rich man, Max.

1230
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:28,916
Well, I'm too fond of gambling for that,

1231
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,125
but I do have a certain lifestyle
that I've come to enjoy.

1232
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:37,958
I imagine I could get by on around...

1233
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:42,250
£10,000 for the note

1234
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:45,416
and my silence
when I take the stand tomorrow.

1235
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,125
This is blackmail.

1236
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:49,583
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

1237
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:52,041
[Favell chuckles] Yeah. Call the police.

1238
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:56,000
Might even put us in the same cell.

1239
01:36:57,583 --> 01:36:58,666
Not for long, though.

1240
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:02,000
I imagine you're looking
at the noose, Maxim.

1241
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:11,458
[coroner] At Inspector Welch's request,

1242
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:14,125
there's a change
to this morning's proceedings.

1243
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:15,791
We shall now hear

1244
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:19,125
from the de Winters' housekeeper,
Mrs. Danvers.

1245
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,958
[Welch] Safe to say
not much occurs at Manderley

1246
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:31,625
without your knowledge
or say-so, would I be right?

1247
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:34,791
I ensure the smooth running of the house.

1248
01:37:35,375 --> 01:37:37,083
[Welch] Which is how
you came to be aware

1249
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:40,166
of the late Mrs. de Winter's
relationship with Mr. Favell.

1250
01:37:41,041 --> 01:37:43,375
[Mrs. Danvers] Well, I was
aware they were, um, intimate.

1251
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:45,541
But my lady's
private affairs were her own.

1252
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,916
[Welch] So they should be.

1253
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,166
But since
these circumstances are far from normal,

1254
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:52,666
perhaps you'd share with the court
what you told me last night.

1255
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:56,375
I learned of a note
addressed to Mr. Favell.

1256
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:59,875
I urged him to share that note with you.

1257
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:04,000
A note Mr. de Winter
seemed keen to keep from this court.

1258
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:05,083
[Mrs. Danvers] Yes.

1259
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:10,750
The note was inviting Mr. Favell
to join Mrs. de Winter at the house...

1260
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,666
the night my lady died.

1261
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:19,500
Mr. de Winter offered money
in exchange for that note.

1262
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,666
[Welch] The note
was from Rebecca de Winter.

1263
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:22,750
[Mrs. Danvers] It was.

1264
01:38:23,416 --> 01:38:26,208
She wrote
she had urgent news to share with him.

1265
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:32,250
And how much was Mr. Favell offered?

1266
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:34,458
£10,000.

1267
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:36,333
[audience murmuring]

1268
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,250
[Welch] A check...

1269
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:47,458
written by Mr. de Winter...
in exchange for the note.

1270
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:49,458
Where does it say that?
All you have is a check.

1271
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:52,061
- Nothing to say what it's for.
- [coroner] Order! Madam, order.

1272
01:38:53,083 --> 01:38:58,291
Mrs. Danvers, do you think it's likely
Rebecca de Winter drowned herself?

1273
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:00,791
[Mrs. Danvers] No, sir. I do not.

1274
01:39:00,875 --> 01:39:04,166
In the weeks, uh, leading up to her death,

1275
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:09,666
she had become
fatigued and was feeling sick.

1276
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:14,541
And she asked me
to let out the waistband in her trousers.

1277
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:17,291
Her belly was growing.

1278
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:24,750
Mrs. de Winter went to London
the day she died. Did she say why?

1279
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:26,416
- [Mrs. Danvers] No.
- Odd.

1280
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,708
It must've been something deeply personal
for her to have kept that from me.

1281
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:32,291
Like, say, an appointment with her doctor.

1282
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:35,333
Not her family doctor,
as you might expect, but someone discreet.

1283
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,500
Away from prying eyes

1284
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:42,000
as if news of her condition
was something she wished to keep private.

1285
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:47,333
A wish to share
only with her lover, Jack Favell.

1286
01:39:48,166 --> 01:39:52,000
You murdering bastard.
[loudly] You're a murdering bastard!

1287
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:54,583
With my child! I hope they hang you.

1288
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:57,250
I hope they hang you!
You murdered Rebecca!

1289
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:58,833
Only two possible verdicts.

1290
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:02,708
I hope you agree, sir,
that there's no motive at all for suicide.

1291
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:05,583
But a clear one for murder.

1292
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:09,625
[coroner] This inquest is suspended
pending a criminal investigation.

1293
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:12,166
Ladies and gentlemen, court is adjourned.

1294
01:40:13,416 --> 01:40:14,916
Nobody's above the law.

1295
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:18,458
[Maxim] Get your hands off me! Get off!

1296
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:19,833
[Welch] Mrs. Danvers.

1297
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:22,125
Say nothing. They can't prove anything.

1298
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:24,291
I want her appointment books,
diaries, address books,

1299
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:25,916
household finances, everything.

1300
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,041
She saw that doctor sometime
and she paid him.

1301
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:32,875
Roe, start placing calls
to women specialists in London.

1302
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:34,333
[crowd clamoring]

1303
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:05,541
[Mrs. Danvers] No. No.

1304
01:41:12,416 --> 01:41:15,541
[Frank] I'm sorry, do you have
permission to search this place?

1305
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:27,208
[tires screech]

1306
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:36,250
Mrs. de Winter?

1307
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:37,708
- Oh, Frank!
- What?

1308
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,791
I need her checks, her bank statements.

1309
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:42,208
Anything that has
the name and address of her doctor.

1310
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:45,000
Right. Here it is. I know what you need.

1311
01:41:47,375 --> 01:41:49,583
- I need a doctor.
- You need her doctor? There.

1312
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,500
[Mrs. de Winter] That must be it.

1313
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,620
[Mrs. Danvers] Shame on you.

1314
01:41:57,125 --> 01:41:59,625
Shame on you for taking his side.

1315
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:02,250
I'm not taking anyone's side,
Mrs. Danvers. I...

1316
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:06,916
And you, Frank.
Licking Mr. de Winter's boots by day,

1317
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,708
and pawing at the cottage door at night.

1318
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,958
Sobbing like a schoolboy.

1319
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:15,125
She despised you all.

1320
01:42:16,208 --> 01:42:19,041
The men in London,
the men at the Manderley parties.

1321
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:22,250
You were nothing but playthings for her.

1322
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:26,833
And why shouldn't a woman amuse herself?

1323
01:42:30,458 --> 01:42:34,708
She lived her life
as she pleased, my Rebecca.

1324
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:40,458
No wonder a man had to kill her.

1325
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,400
[Mrs. de Winter] It must have hurt.

1326
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:49,583
Knowing your only friend in the world
took a secret like that to her grave.

1327
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:54,833
Pack your bags, Mrs. Danvers.

1328
01:42:55,875 --> 01:42:57,708
I expect you gone by nightfall.

1329
01:43:59,791 --> 01:44:01,250
[honking]

1330
01:44:09,166 --> 01:44:10,416
[gasps]

1331
01:44:20,041 --> 01:44:22,041
[bell tolling]

1332
01:44:44,875 --> 01:44:47,916
- Miss?
- Terribly sorry, I've left my purse.

1333
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,750
[butler] Who was it you saw, Miss?

1334
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:51,666
[Mrs. de Winter] Dr. John Baker.

1335
01:44:58,166 --> 01:44:59,333
Thank you.

1336
01:45:02,791 --> 01:45:04,166
[knocking at door]

1337
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:06,875
[butler] Wait there.

1338
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:18,861
- [butler] Dr. Baker, sir.
- [Dr. Baker] Good evening, Tas.

1339
01:45:23,541 --> 01:45:24,625
"Danvers."

1340
01:45:26,125 --> 01:45:27,125
[door opens]

1341
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:39,166
[Dr. Baker] I see so many patients.

1342
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:43,750
I can't remember her.

1343
01:45:43,833 --> 01:45:46,666
[Welch] Maybe it'll
come back when you see her file.

1344
01:45:51,208 --> 01:45:54,375
[Dr. Baker] It would have been more
convenient to read the file to begin with.

1345
01:45:57,416 --> 01:45:59,458
We'll do what we can to help.

1346
01:45:59,541 --> 01:46:02,208
Oh, no. This is not as it should be.

1347
01:46:04,166 --> 01:46:05,416
Where's she gone now?

1348
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
[Dr. Baker] Who?

1349
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:10,125
[butler] The young woman who was here.

1350
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,666
It's not here.

1351
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:17,041
I'll have a word with my secretary.

1352
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:22,875
[Dr. Baker] It's possible
she misplaced it.

1353
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:27,708
This girl. Is there any way
she could get out of here?

1354
01:46:34,416 --> 01:46:35,416
[door opens]

1355
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,875
- [door creaking]
- [Mrs. de Winter inhales sharply]

1356
01:46:58,458 --> 01:47:01,416
I read it, that's all.
I haven't changed a word Dr. Baker wrote.

1357
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:05,416
Rebecca Danvers.
Yes, now I remember. Terrible thing.

1358
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:08,333
That wasn't her real name.
And she wasn't pregnant.

1359
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,208
Then why would she use a false name?

1360
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:12,666
Why would she come all the way to London

1361
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,083
to make an appointment with you
and not her family doctor?

1362
01:47:15,166 --> 01:47:18,208
Perhaps she wanted
to spare her family the news.

1363
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:19,958
That the baby wasn't her husband's?

1364
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:24,041
Inspector, I am not
that kind of women's specialist.

1365
01:47:24,125 --> 01:47:28,375
I'm not an obstetrician.
My field is oncology.

1366
01:47:28,458 --> 01:47:31,833
I treat cancers
of the reproductive system.

1367
01:47:31,916 --> 01:47:34,416
The bloating, the fatigue.
They're common symptoms.

1368
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:37,333
She had cancer.

1369
01:47:39,666 --> 01:47:41,333
There's her news for Jack Favell.

1370
01:47:41,416 --> 01:47:43,791
That doesn't prove she killed herself.

1371
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:46,166
She wouldn't have wanted to suffer.

1372
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:48,375
Yes, she told me as much.

1373
01:47:49,125 --> 01:47:51,750
She was very advanced
by the time she was symptomatic.

1374
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:53,250
Saw her first in April,

1375
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:56,583
by May, it was clear
she was too far gone for treatment.

1376
01:47:56,666 --> 01:48:00,500
She only had weeks
and the pain would have been considerable.

1377
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:03,000
How did she do it?

1378
01:48:05,583 --> 01:48:07,916
She took out her boat and scuttled it.

1379
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:10,625
She drowned herself.

1380
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:16,875
[latch drawing]

1381
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,875
[keys jingling]

1382
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:20,041
[lock turning]

1383
01:48:53,458 --> 01:48:55,125
Stroke of luck for you there, Max.

1384
01:49:04,791 --> 01:49:06,375
I bet you think you've won, don't you?

1385
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:11,125
Well, maybe the law can't get you.
I still can.

1386
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:14,916
Is there anything else you want to say?

1387
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:17,483
If there is, you better say it now.

1388
01:49:31,666 --> 01:49:33,875
Do you know what I hate her for most?

1389
01:49:35,458 --> 01:49:37,291
It's what she's taken from you.

1390
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:42,750
It's gone forever. That funny, young,
lost look I loved so much.

1391
01:49:44,458 --> 01:49:46,291
You're not that person anymore.

1392
01:49:46,916 --> 01:49:48,458
Don't hate her for that.

1393
01:50:32,916 --> 01:50:35,958
What's that burning?
Oh, my God, that's Manderley.

[Frith] Come on! Get away from there.

1396
01:50:46,208 --> 01:50:49,041
Get off the lawn! Go! Come on!

1397
01:50:50,791 --> 01:50:52,751
[Maxim] Get off the lawn!
Frith, get off the lawn!

1398
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:54,625
How many people are inside?
Is everyone out?

1399
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:58,083
- [Frith] I don't know, sir.
- You all right? What happened, Clarice?

1400
01:50:58,166 --> 01:50:59,250
I saw her.

1401
01:50:59,333 --> 01:51:01,333
[Mrs. de Winter] What do you mean?
Who did you see?

1402
01:51:01,375 --> 01:51:02,791
[Clarice] Mrs. Danvers.

1403
01:51:02,875 --> 01:51:06,000
[Maxim] Help her! Where are the hoses?

1404
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:10,291
- Where is she?
- She went to the boat house.

01:52:18,958 --> 01:52:21,125
[Mrs. de Winter] Mrs. Danvers! Please!

1410
01:52:22,583 --> 01:52:23,750
Please come away.

1411
01:52:25,041 --> 01:52:27,041
You asked for my help. Here it is.

1412
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:29,500
Mrs. Danvers, please.

1413
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,833
He killed the only person I loved.

1414
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:36,000
I can't let you have Manderley.

1415
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:38,875
It was ours, you see.

1416
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,208
You don't have to do this.

1417
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:46,750
I know you'll stand by him.
But you'll never know happiness.

1418
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:51,291
Yes, I will.

[Mrs. de Winter] <i>Last night,
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.</i>

1423
01:53:58,458 --> 01:54:01,208
<i>I dreamt of Mrs. Danvers and of Rebecca.</i>

1424
01:54:05,833 --> 01:54:10,416
<i>But this morning I woke up
and left the dead behind.</i>

01:54:12,833 --> 01:54:16,958
<i>And as I sit before the mirror
in our stuffy little room in Cairo,</i>

1426
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:22,000
<i>just another stop
on our quest to find a real home,</i>

<i>I can see the woman I am now.</i>

1428
01:54:28,416 --> 01:54:31,250
<i>And I know
that I have made the right decision...</i>

1429
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:37,625
<i>to save the one thing
worth walking through flames for.</i>

<i>Love.</i>
