00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,318
Crazy as a bull bat.

314
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,672
But he's a heap more dog
than I ever had him figured for.

(BIRDS TWITTERING)

317
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,165
Just listen to those
songbirds this mornin'...

318
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,983
Singin' their heads off.

319

(SIGHS)

320
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,171
It's like the year
your Papa and I settled here.

321
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,966
We meant to build over
at the Salt Licks settlement

322
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,819
where it would've been safer
from the Indians, but...

323
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:52,433
That last day, we camped by the spring.

324
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,644
And the bee myrtle was in blossom

325
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,840
and full of singin' birds, like now.

326
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,551
And it was all so pretty,
I just couldn't go on.

327
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:07,389
And I said to your Papa,
"Jim, this is it.

328
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,634
"This is home."

329
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,642
Hello, the house!

330
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,459
It's Bud Searcy and Lisbeth, too.

331
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,278
You might know he'd land
right at mealtime.

332
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,425
Howdy, Miss Coates. Howdy do?
Howdy, boy. How's everybody?

333
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,510
- Hello, Mr. Searcy.
- Slide down, child.

334
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,553
Hello, Lisbeth.

335
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,264
Just dropped over to see
if there's anything I could do.

336
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,726
Travis, take this pony to the corn crib
and strip the saddle gear off him.

337
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,771
- TRAVIS: Yes, Mr. Searcy.
- Might feed him a bit of corn

338
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,481
while you're at it, boy.

339
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,857
Won't you come and set a while?

340
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,652
Well, I believe I will shade
up for a spell, Miss Coates.

341
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,029
Come on, Lisbeth. Hot, ain't it?

342
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,199
We don't get some rain pretty soon,
this country's gonna burn up bad.

343
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,077
Corn crop ain't gonna be worth nothin'
more than a whirlwind nubbins.

344
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:57,648
Some folks'll be scrapin' the bottom of
their meal barrels come wintertime.

345
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,002
This here's hanged too long.

346
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,420
Lisbeth, honey, run down to the spring

347
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,069
and fetch your poor old pappy
a bucket of fresh water.

348
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,260
I'll tell you, Miss Coates... (SIGHS)

349
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,055
It's a heavy responsibility
ridin' herd on the settlement

350
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,224
while the menfolks is gone.

351
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,184
Wears a man right down to a frazzle.

352
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,560
But I ain't complainin', though.

353
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,834
I was chose for this job
and I'll get her done.

354
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,153
I, uh, kinda figured to head up
that cow drive to Kansas myself.

355
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,572
But when man after man
called me all spoke private like...

356
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,907
Beggin' me to stay behind,

357
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,760
look after you womenfolks
and the young ones, I seen my duty.

358
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,538
Knowed I was bein' called on
for a bigger job.

359
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,748
Jim said you were gonna protect us all.

360
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,960
Mighty lucky thing I done it, too.
Know what happened the other day?

361
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,294
That fool kid of Jed Simpson's

362
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,171
shot at a bunch of javelina hogs
and wounded one of 'em.

363
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,092
Set it too squealin'. Ha! Be dogged
that the rest of them didn't tree that boy.

364
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,412
Kept him up there too till I happened
along and seed what a pickle he was in.

365
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:57,391
Of course I couldn't chase
them pesky javelinas off.

366
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,978
But I did go tell that boy's Mama where
he was, so she could rest easy

367
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,173
till the varmints left out
and give him a chance to climb down.

368
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,612
Yep. Lookin' out after you womenfolks

369
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,431
and the young ones
sure keeps a man a-hoppin' around.

370
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,368
Biggest bother I've had, though, lately

371
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,620
is the thievin' what's been
goin' on at Salt Licks.

372
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,913
(CHUCKLES)

373
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,625
Meat stole out of smoke houses.
Hen's nests gettin' robbed.

374
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,795
- Mama, I'm hung...
- Hush, baby. Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

375
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,257
Womenfolks losin' bread what they
set out in their windows to cool.

376
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,802
- Sounds like some varmint.
- There ain't no varmint that clever, boy.

377
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,845
Mama, I'm hungry.

378
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,346
- When we gonna ea...
- Arliss.

379
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,349
I told you, don't butt in.
Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

380
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,293
(CHUCKLES)
That's all right, Miss Coates.

381
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,665
Ain't nothin' like a little old boy
to know when it's time to eat.

382
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,279
Well, I guess it is gettin'
on toward dinnertime.

383
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,657
Travis, will you go down to the corn
patch and pick us some roastin' ears?

384
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:59,432
Now, just a minute, Miss Coates.
That boy need help to tote all that corn.

385
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,438
Yes, sir.

386
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,646
(CHUCKLES)
Lisbeth, go along with Travis.

387
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,440
Be sure you pick out ears
what is sweet and juicy.

388
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,064
Why, coons been in this corn!
Them thievin' rascals!

389
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,650
You'll have to take to
doggin' 'em overnight.

390
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,485
I got me just the dog for it.

391
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,259
Old Yeller will wipe up the ground
with them pesky varmints.

392
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,200
You think he can't do it?

393
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,578
Oh, no. It... It ain't that. Uh...

394
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,182
Well, I didn't wanna
tell you at the house, but...

395
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,064
It was him what done it.

396
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,729
What done what?

397
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:54,033
What stole all them eggs
and bread and meat and stuff.

398
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,573
You mean Old Yeller?

399
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,621
I seen him suck a batch of eggs.

400
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,206
Seen him swipe a pan of
Grandma's corn bread too.

401
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,998
- But I ain't gonna tell.
- I bet you do.

402
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,649
No, I won't.

403
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,219
Wasn't goin' to even before
I knowed he was your dog.

404
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,717
How come?

405
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,307
Because Miss Priss is gonna have pups.

406
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,309
Your dog'll be their papa.

407
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,514
And I wouldn't want him
to get shot for stealin'.

408
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,632
Just an old arrowhead I picked up.

409
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,985
Comanche, Papa said.

410
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,701
Well, you can have it.

411
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,043
I won't never, never tell.

412
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,938
When you git right down to hogs,
just about the best eatin' there is alive.

413
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,025
And I reckon just about the meanest
critter alive go after his meat.

414
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,485
Cut you 14 different ways
before you can get fixed to rot.

415
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,862
They scare me to death.

416
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,385
Always dread the time when Jim
comes to do the markin'.

417
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:03,619
Yep, hogs is bad, mighty bad. I had me
an uncle once down in east Texas,

418
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,455
tangled a bad hog, he did.
Got cut all to pieces.

419
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,852
Kill him?

420
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,126
Kill him? Why, it killed him
deader than a doornail.

421
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,504
Mr. Searcy, I roped me a rabbit once.

422
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,732
Arliss, be quiet. Mr. Searcy's talkin'.

423
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,118
Well, I did. A mean old bitin' one.

424
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,804
(LAUGHING)

425
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:27,000
Well now, boy, that's really
doin' some ropin'. (CHUCKLING)

426
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,396
You know, speakin' of ropin', I always
done my hog work from up a tree.

427
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,748
Heap safer that way.

428
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,046
How can you work hogs from a tree?

429
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,153
Why, it's strict as a whistle, boy.

430
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,906
Pick you out a tree with a low
hanging limb, but still out of hog reach.

431
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,325
Get your dog to rally
them hogs around the tree.

432
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,099
Reach down your loop,
pull up your pig and go to work on him.

433
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,431
By golly!
That sounds like it might work.

434
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,457
Work? Why, of course it works!

435
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,835
Them old hogs can fuss and charge
around all they please, but up a tree

436
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,108
you're as safe as at home in bed.

437
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:10,477
Travis, boy, you go fetch my pony,
and we'll be pullin' out for home.

438
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,501
I've got a powerful lot to do
before supper time.

439
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,862
(LOUD SIGH)

440
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,431
It was right neighborly like
of you to feed us, Miss Coates.

441
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,535
Now, don't you fret yourself at all
while your man's gone.

442
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:30,372
We'll be lookin' in on you again before
you know it. Bye, boy. Bye, Miss Coates.

443
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,019
TRAVIS: Bye, Lisbeth.

444
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,813
Bye.

445
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,990
No wonder they don't want him
on no cow drive.

446
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,636
By the time he finished eatin' and visitin'
with everyone this side of Abilene,

447
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,514
them cows would be dead of old age.

448
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,058
Mama, Lisbeth says it's Old Yeller

449
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,228
what's been doin'
all that stealin' out in Salt Licks.

450
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,272
Claimed she catched him at it.

451
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,692
Why, the old rogue.
We'll have to break him of that,

452
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,403
or else everyone
in Salt Licks'll be mad at us.

453
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,614
Somebody'll shoot him! Yeller!

454
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,763
- (CHICKENS CLUCKING)
- Come here!

455
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,639
You old rascal. You been stealin'!

456
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,584
Maybe we better
take to pennin' him overnight.

457
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,503
I reckon we won't
have to bother for a while.

458
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:23,008
Listen! I'm gonna keep you
so dang busted busy

459
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,531
you won't have time to go off prowlin'!

and I want him bad.

Didn't tell your Mama this.
Didn't want to fret her.

603

But there's a plague of hydrophobia
in these parts.

00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:31,400

a fox and a skunk that had it.

606
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,074
I wanted to warn you
not to take any chances.

607
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,515
Well, I don't know if I could tell
if a critter's got the sickness.

608
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,725
You can't hardly tell at first.

609
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,329
Not until they get to the point
of slobberin' and staggerin' around.

610
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,753
You see a critter in that fix,
you know for sure.

611
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,653
But you wanna watch
for others that ain't that far along.

612
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,114
Now you take a bobcat and a fox...

613
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,908
You know they'll run
if they get the chance.

614
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,036
But when one don't run,
or maybe makes fight at you,

01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,952
- Fits of temper?
- Of course not!

771
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,955
Well, you better keep a close watch
on them. Liable to show up at any time.

772
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,499
Recollect had me an uncle once
down in east Texas.

773
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,293
Got mad dog bit, he did.

774
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,296
Knowed he was bound to die.
Chained himself to a sweet gum tree.

775
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:50,797
Stayed right there
till sickness took ahold.

776
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,049
Mr. Searcy, please.

777
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,717
But it's the gospel truth, Miss Coates!

778
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,427
He went to snarlin' and snappin'
at everything in sight.

779
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,970
He run at his woman
and young 'uns, tryin' to bite 'em.

780
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,244
He'd have done it too
if that chain hadn't held him back.

781
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,577
Stayed right there
till he died of the slobberin' fits.

782
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:04,978
They buried him
under that sweet gum tree...

783
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,522
Mr. Searcy, that's enough!
Not another word!

784
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,919
Biggest, nicest funeral you ever did...

785
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,697
What do you mean,
tellin' an ugly story like that

786
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,324
to a boy who's just been hog cut?

787
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,410
Now, Miss Coates, I was just
tryin' to give a word of warnin'.

788
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,579
Reckon if I can't be
of no more help around here,

789
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,997
I'll be makin' tracks for home.

790
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,833
Help. There are plenty of ways
a man could help around here.

791
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,086
Huh? By doin' what, Miss Coates?

792
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,630
Like hitchin' up the mule
and gatherin' in the corn crop

793
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,674
before the deer eat it up,
or the blowin' rain rot it in the field!

794
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,511
Now, don't you fret yourself
at all about that corn crop, Miss Coates.

795
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,534
I'll be glad to take care
of that. Lisbeth?

796
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,890
Yes, Papa?

797
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,226
Lisbeth, honey, Miss Coates here,
she's in kind of a bind.

798
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,769
Ain't got her corn in the crib yet.

799
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,522
Figured I'll leave you behind
to help her with the job.

800
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:52,484
Mr. Searcy, Lisbeth's nothin'
but a little girl.

801
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,569
Yeah, well, she ain't much for size,

802
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,696
but she's just like her old pappy...
Stout and willin'!

804
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:04,538
Now, don't you forget, Miss Coates.
If there's any other thing I can do for you,

805
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,082
don't you be bashful about tellin' me.

806
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:09,150
I'm on call day or night.

I do believe you are cooler.

810
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,867
Mama, don't let
what Mr. Searcy said bother you.

811
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,219
I'm gonna be all right!

812
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,396
I'm sure you will be.

813
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:50,250
I know, Mama. Mama, I know.

814
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,586
I got a good look at them hogs.

815

She's been actin' flighty lately,
like she was scared of her own shadow.

And this mornin' she wouldn't
let her calf suckle neither.

823
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,455
I think, maybe,
she's got a bit of pea vine.

No, Mama, it can't be pea vine.

- Lucky you had Old Yeller.

It was lucky for us, son,

And he saved mine and Arliss'! We can't!

01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:11,597
There's no hope for him now, Travis.

925
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,668
He's sufferin'.
You know we've got to do it.

- I know, Mama.

01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:59,184
Hiya, boy.
Ain't them injuns scalped you yet?

935
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,753
- Papa, what'd you bring me?
- I brought you somethin', all right.

936
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:08,527
Just hold your potatoes
while I go kiss your Mama.

Jim! Oh, Jim!

938
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,201
What'd you bring me home, Papa?
Where is it?

939

- (JINGLING)
- Hear this, Katie? Money. Cash money.

940
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:33,005
First we've had since the war.

941

That ain't all.

942
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,411
- What?
- I got that dress.

943
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,413
- Prettiest thing you ever seen.
- Oh!

944
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,331
And a fancy pair of shoes to go with it.

945
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,584
- Gee-whiz!
- Put it on, son.

All right, Chief. Let's hit the warpath.

(WHOOPING) Come on, boy!

Oh, Jim!

951
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,381
It's lovely.

952
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,053
I been achin' to see it on you.

953
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,791
Where's Travis?

954
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:29,545
I wanna get a look at his face
when he sees the horse I brung him.

955
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,114
Him and Lisbeth Searcy
are over at North Hill...

956
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,405
Burying Old Yeller.

957
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,737
JIM: Old Yeller?

958
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,739
KATIE: Come in the house
and I'll tell you about it.

959
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,181
Travis?

960
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:08,084
If you could just come
to like the pup...

961
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,420
He... He's part Old Yeller.

962
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,693
He may be part Old Yeller,

963
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,238
but he ain't Old Yeller.

964
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:52,152
Your mama told me about the dog.

965
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,066
Come sit down, son.

966
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,728
That was rough, son.

967
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,440
As rough a thing as
I ever heard tell of.

968
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:17,570
But I'm mighty proud
of how my boy stood up to it.

969
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,014
Couldn't ask no more of a grown man.

970
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:25,807
Thing to do now is... Try and forget it.

971
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,038
Go on bein' a man.

972
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:31,859
How, Pa? How you gonna
forget somethin' like that?

973
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,355
I guess I don't quite mean that.

974
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:39,300
Reckon it's not a thing you can forget.

975
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,324
Maybe not even a thing you wanna forget.

976
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,955
What I'm tryin' to say is...

977
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,706
- Life's like that sometimes.
- Like what?

978
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,134
Well.

979
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:02,781
Now and then, for no good
reason a man can figure out,

980
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:06,660
life will just haul off
and knock him flat.

981
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,061
Slam him again' the ground so hard
it seems like all his insides is busted.

982
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,502
But it's not all like that.

983
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,570
A lot of it's mighty fine.

984
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:22,509
And you can't afford to waste
the good part frettin' about the bad.

985
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,987
That makes it all bad.

986
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,390
You understand
what I'm trying to get at?

987
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,163
Yes, sir.

988
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,836
It's just that...

989
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:36,124
Yeah, sure, I know.

990
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:41,046
Sayin' it's one thing
and feelin' it's another.

991
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,532
But I'll tell you a trick
that's sometimes a big help.

992
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,618
You start lookin' around
for somethin' good

993
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,436
to take the place of the bad.

994
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,435
As a general rule, you can find it.

995
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:03,442
- Brought you that horse I promised.
- Yes, sir.

996
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:07,846
I reckon you ain't in no shape
to take pleasure in him yet.

997
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,598
No, sir.

998
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,767
We'll just keep him a while.

999
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,311
Maybe you'll come to
feel different later on.

1000
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,397
Your mama was fixin' supper
when I left the house.

1001
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:20,252
Might hurt her feelings
if we're not there on time to eat it.

Don't look like to me he's hardly
