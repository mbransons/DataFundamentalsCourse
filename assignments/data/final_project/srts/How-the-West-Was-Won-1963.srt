1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:30,200


2
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,502
<i>The 1860s was a decade...</i>

3
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,139
<i>...in which one of the most
terrible civil wars in history...</i>

4
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,969
<i>...was to begin and end.</i>

5
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,237
<i>But far from the bloody fields
of Gettysburg and Shiloh...</i>

6
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,973
<i>...changes which were
to alter forever...</i>

7
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,982
<i>...the face of the American West
had already begun.</i>

8
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,620
<i>Telegraphs were spinning
a web of voices...</i>

9
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,380
<i>...across the Great Plains.</i>

10
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,547
<i>And railroads were pushing steel fingers...</i>

11
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,488
<i>...into the heart of the wilderness.</i>

12
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,094
<i>Along their rights of way,
new trails were being broken.</i>

13
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,527
<i>New towns were born overnight.</i>

14
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,862
<i>And settlers by the tens
of thousands poured westward...</i>

15
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,265
<i>...and began putting plows to the land...</i>

16
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,906
<i>...the Indian considered his birthright.</i>

17
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,065
<i>The inevitable happened.</i>

18
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,508
<i>Two totally divergent cultures,
Indian and white...</i>

19
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,580
<i>...met on a collision course.</i>

20
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,582
<i>The white man demanded
his Manifest Destiny...</i>

21
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,585
<i>...the right to take the land he wanted.</i>

22
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,088
<i>And the Army began
the subjugation of the red man...</i>

23
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,489
<i>...with a savagery that
plunged this nation...</i>

24
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,027
<i>...into a series of Indian wars...</i>

25
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,928
<i>...that were to last more
than a quarter of a century.</i>

26
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,236
How many would you say?

27
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,936
Oh, about 30 of them.

28
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,240
I'll ride on down,
tell them you're coming in to talk.

29
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,144
I didn't come here to talk.

30
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,979
Form skirmish lines!

31
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,121
What do you think you're doing?

32
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,280
My orders are to attack.

33
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,482
I don't give a damn
what your orders are, colonel.

34
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,184
There's no need for a fight here.

35
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,841
Those Arapaho down there
are starving.

36
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,956
Besides, they've got women
and children with them.

37
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,458
Nothing they can do but surrender.

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,500
My orders from General Connor are explicit.

39
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,603
I'm not to accept surrender on any terms.

40
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,262
And I'm to kill every hostile
over the age of 12.

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,465
You lied to me, Caine.

42
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,007
I didn't have any choice.

43
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,337
I was told you wouldn't guide us
if you knew my orders.

44
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,878
- Sergeant...
- Caine...

45
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,211
...you give the order for a massacre,
I'll gut you belly to brisket.

46
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,408
Arrest this man!

47
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,191
Knock him down!

48
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,553
Kill him, sir?

49
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,456
Shoot!

50
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,836
Bugler!

51
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,553
Fire at will!

52
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,413
Cut them off from the horses!

53
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,747
Take no prisoners!

54
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,986
Sergeant? Somebody on foot
approaching main gate.

55
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,816
Here.

56
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,756
They haven't had a thing
to eat in two days.

57
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,190
Feed them.

58
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,454
Feed them!

59
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,568
Caine's outfit come in here?

60
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,260
Only the wounded, sir.

61
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,928
Caine?

62
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,006
He was among the wounded.

63
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,559
You can't...

64
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,168
Where's Colonel Caine?

65
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,707
Zeb?

66
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:15,279
I want that butcher's scalp.
Where is he?

67
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,282
He took an arrow in the throat
in that Arapaho raid.

68
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,044
He's dead, Zeb.

69
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:38,163
<i>Deserters, often for reasons</i>
<i>totally unrelated to cowardice...</i>

70
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,601
<i>...have plagued armies since wars began.</i>

71
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,333
<i>And American armies have been no exception.</i>

72
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,034
<i>During the Civil War
there were 200,000 deserters...</i>

73
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,180
<i>...from Union forces alone...</i>

74
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,510
<i>...and more than 76,000 were hunted down.</i>

75
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,652
<i>For the most part, provost marshals...</i>

76
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,515
<i>...who continued to search
for runaways after the war ended...</i>

77
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,884
<i>...were decent and dedicated men.</i>

78
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:04,291
<i>But for a few, the hunt was often
the prelude to a kill.</i>

79
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,658
Micah Sloane?

80
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,891
Who are you?

81
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,559
You've got a bad memory, Sloane.

82
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,672
Maybe you'd remember better
if I was still in uniform.

83
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,831
Captain Grey!

84
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,601
Drop the gun belt.

85
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,776
You gonna kill me?

86
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,546
I'd sooner see you hang...

87
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,283
...but it'll save me time
if I bury you here.

88
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,586
It's up to you.

89
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,661
Mind if I get my hat and coat?

90
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,392
Get them.

91
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,289
Uncle Zeb!

92
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,391
Hey, about time somebody's
stirring around here.

93
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,618
Sun's been up over an hour.

94
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,455
Uncle Zeb.

95
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,873
We've been expecting you ever
since we heard the war was over.

96
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,559
Ow. Easy there, Luke.

97
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,602
I got a few stitches ain't healed up yet.

98
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,104
What happened?

99
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,243
Oh, it's a long story.
How long you been back?

100
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,378
Last time I was here,
you were still on the run.

101
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,309
Eh, nobody's come looking for me...

102
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,813
...so Ma figured it was all right
for me to come home.

103
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,212
How long you been back?

104
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,182
Oh, a couple months now, I guess.

105
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,948
Well, I'd still keep an eye peeled.

106
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,147
How's your Ma?

107
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,690
Eh, she's still working on the principle...

108
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,055
...that idleness is a mortal sin.

109
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,662
Well, it looks like it's paid off.

110
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,271
Things are looking good around here.

111
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,457
Yeah. Hey, wait here a second,
will you, Uncle Zeb?

112
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,693
Sure.

113
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,336
Yeah, I'll go fetch her.

114
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,869
Hey, Ma? There's something
out here you ought to see.

115
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,568
I'm busy, Luke.

116
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,304
Well, Ma, you should see this.

117
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,743
In a minute.

118
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,076
All right.

119
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,481
I just thought you'd like to know
there's a bear in your vegetable garden.

120
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,985
Bear?

121
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,428
Zeb!

122
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,597
Katie.

123
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,289
Oh, Zeb, how are you?

124
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,626
Oh, fine, fine, Kate.

125
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:56,961
You look tired.

126
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,003
Well, I had a long ride
from Fort Kearny, you know...

127
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,696
...a few stops along the way...

128
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,865
...saloons and sporting houses and such.

129
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,171
I bet they know you by sight
and first name in every one.

130
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,042
Say, I think it's good
for you living out here.

131
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,447
You know, if I'd said that a while ago,
it'd have caused a hell of a ruckus.

132
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,419
Zeb, you mind your language
while you're here.

133
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,385
- Uncle Zeb!
- Uncle Zeb!

134
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,617
Uncle Zeb!

135
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,694
How are you?

136
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,261
All right now, your Uncle Zeb's
had a long trip, and he's tired.

137
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,678
Now, go inside and get dressed.

138
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,364
- We'll talk later.
- He just got here.

139
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,134
There's so much to talk about. Come on.

140
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,674
We'll talk later, girls.

141
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,277
Josh. Go ahead.

142
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,970
Okay, Ma.

143
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,913
Oh, Kate, you've... You've brought
this place a long ways.

144
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,780
Is something wrong, Zeb? Are you hurt?

145
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,945
Oh, nothing. Nothing particular.

146
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,249
Zeb?

147
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,415
I got shot in a skirmish, Kate.

148
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,685
Where?

149
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,328
Oh, at the Black River.

150
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,465
Army surgeon got a bullet out of me.
The stitches just ain't healed.

151
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,534
You rode all the way from Fort Kearny
in that condition?

152
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,798
The Army and I ain't exactly seeing
eye-to-eye these days, Kate.

153
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,170
I've had about all their hospitality
I can stand.

154
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,038
You come on in, Zeb.

155
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,976
You're gonna eat, and then
you're gonna rest. Come on.

156
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,082
Oh, sounds good.

157
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,309
Still bossy. Ha, ha, ha!

158
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,648
Never seen kids with that kind of grit.

159
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,689
Had to walk more than 60 miles...

160
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,023
...a lot of it through snow,
because the only way to the fort...

161
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,596
...was over the high passes.

162
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,996
It was freezing at night.

163
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:41,037
The last two days they didn't even have
nothing to eat.

164
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,174
But not one of them quit.

165
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,310
Babies cried some...

166
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,638
...because we had nothing at all
to feed them.

167
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:53,615
But the others, there wasn't
a one of them that even whined.

168
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,346
What'll happen to the children, Uncle Zeb?

169
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:03,155
Well, I reckon they'll take them
on some Indian reservation, honey.

170
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,194
What kind of man can give an order...

171
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,924
...to kill everyone over the age of 12?

172
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,229
A man called Brigadier
General Patrick E. Connor.

173
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,235
How do they expect the children to survive?

174
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,464
Near as I can figure, they didn't.

175
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,802
Makes you ashamed to be a white man.

176
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,445
Now the Indians,
they done things differently.

177
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,705
Now, they...
They used to fight each other...

178
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,975
...and have wars long before any of us
ever come into this country...

179
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,982
...but they did it by rules of honor.

180
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,348
Scalping was honor?

181
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:34,856
Well, there was a couple northern tribes
used to do ritual scalping...

182
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,655
...but it took the white man
to teach the Indian...

183
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,298
...how to make scalping a way of life.

184
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,560
We should realize
how fortunate we are.

185
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,229
I think we should give thanks.

186
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,375
Jessie.

187
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,042
Our father who art in heaven...

188
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,738
...we thank thee
from the bottom of our hearts...

189
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,907
...for bringing us all together
this day in peace and love.

190
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,382
Amen.

191
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,453
Amen.

192
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,186
Mama?

193
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,057
Mama, you always said
that when Uncle Zeb and Luke got back...

194
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,960
...we'd all go on to Oregon.

195
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,203
Well, we didn't leave
Virginia to settle here.

196
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,809
It was your father's dream
to go on to Oregon.

197
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,639
Laura's right, Ma.

198
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,247
You always said when the family
got together again we'd go.

199
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,311
It sure looks like we're together.

200
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,388
Well, Zeb?

201
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,526
Well, Oregon's still a long ways off...

202
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,251
...and the hardest part's ahead of us.

203
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,056
It's always been a long way off.

204
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,063
Is it gonna get any easier later on?

205
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,064
No.

206
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,600
It ain't gonna get no easier.

207
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,761
And like Josh here says...

208
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,339
...we are all together.

209
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,339
Then we're going?

210
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,144
Kate?

211
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,444
Oregon.

212
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,450
Oregon!

213
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:19,290
Sixty-two, 63, 64, 65 cents.

214
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,490
You drive a hard bargain, Mrs. Macahan.

215
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,635
You've got yourself two fine sows, Mr.
Jones...

216
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,963
...and a healthy litter
and another due any day now.

217
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,662
When do you figure to pull out?

218
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,273
Soon.

219
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,068
I wish you all the best.

220
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,835
Thank you, Mr. Jones.

221
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,469
Thank you, boys.
Have a safe trip.

222
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,121
Well, how much did you get?

223
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,452
$11.65

224
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,788
Ma, you're a hallelujah.

225
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,954
We're gonna need every penny of it.

226
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,063
Hey, Ma?

227
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,033
Looks like you got
another customer.

228
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,913
Good morning, ma'am.

229
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,275
Morning.

230
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,974
- You must be Mrs. Macahan.
- I am.

231
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,746
Nice day, isn't it?

232
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,118
Twenty-two years old, a little over 6 feet,
light brown hair...

233
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,488
You'd be Luke Macahan.
Drop the gun belt, boy.

234
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,288
What do you think you're doing?

235
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,057
I'm sorry to inform you, ma'am,
but your son's under arrest...

236
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,325
...for desertion from
the United States Army.

237
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,163
Now, this is our land,
and you're trespassing.

238
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,497
I want you off of it.

239
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:38,166
Battle of Shiloh, April 7, 1862.

240
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,140
Name's Grey.

241
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,974
Captain Grey.

242
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,515
I'm a representative of the United States
provost marshal's office.

243
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,880
Drop the gun belt, boy.

244
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,989
I told you, boy, drop it.

245
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,969
Now let's get something
straight, son.

246
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,401
I'm gonna take you to trial.

247
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,370
If you give me any trouble...

248
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,031
...I'll bury you.

249
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,871
Speaking of burials, mister...

250
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,876
...one twitch and it'll be yours.

251
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,709
Whoever you are...

252
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,511
...you're interfering with the law.

253
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,154
Name's Zebulon Macahan...

254
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,847
...uncle to him.

255
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,322
You move that scatter gun,
I'll empty that saddle.

256
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,018
Aiding a deserter's
a criminal offense, Macahan.

257
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,596
Now are you gonna
step down or eat dirt?

258
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,596
Now, Zeb,
you're not helping Luke.

259
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,632
Kate, I know this man.
He's built himself...

260
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,464
...a reputation as a bounty hunter.

261
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,299
He's no better than a hired killer.

262
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,442
Drop the gun.

263
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,475
Now step down.

264
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,381
This side.

265
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,186
Get rid of the gun belt.

266
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,128
I'm gonna say it
once more, Macahan...

267
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,559
...just so we're clear.

268
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,666
You're interfering with an officer...

269
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,359
...of the United States Army
in the execution of his duty.

270
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,197
Mister, I ain't got no words...

271
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,738
...to tell you my opinion
of the United States Army...

272
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,637
...and everything it stands for
right now, including you.

273
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,675
You better talk to him, lady.

274
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,007
Right now your son's
facing prison.

275
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,308
If this goes any further,
it could be the hangman.

276
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,576
Zeb?

277
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,879
If you let Luke ride out
with this man, Kate...

278
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,249
...you'll never see him alive again.

279
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,891
Now, town's that way 15 miles, mister.

280
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,527
Start walking.

281
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,923
And if I don't?

282
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,427
I'll drop you right there.

283
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,498
You'll hang, Macahan.

284
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,227
You've got till the count of three. One.

285
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,167
Zeb, you can't. He's the law.

286
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,499
Two.

287
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,834
Zeb.

288
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,805
- Three.
- Zeb!

289
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,278
Don't! Uncle Zeb, don't!

290
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,511
Don't!

291
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,588
Put that knife away.

292
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,781
Do you hear me?
Put it away.

293
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,619
I won't let you kill a man
on my place.

294
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,921
Now get out of here,
Mr. Grey.

295
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,496
Just be thankful you're still alive.

296
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,599
Now, go on.

297
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,768
There'll be another time, Macahan.

298
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,764
Let go of me, boy.

299
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,846
You're a fool, Kate.

300
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,210
You were really
gonna kill that man.

301
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,783
Damn right I was.

302
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,312
Well, did you think
I'd stand by...

303
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,785
...while you cut a man
to pieces?

304
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,675
What you've done
is let that man get away...

305
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,486
...so he's got another chance
to come back and kill your son.

306
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,059
Think he's gonna quit?

307
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,889
The man's a killer.
He's gotta be stopped.

308
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,031
Even if he's
an officer of the law?

309
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,291
It don't matter.

310
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,401
You think Luke was gonna
give up without a fight?

311
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,332
I don't know what
Luke would have done.

312
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,766
And neither do you.

313
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,201
The hell I don't!

314
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,309
He's a Macahan, ain't he?

315
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,117
You leaving, Luke?

316
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,817
Yes, sir.

317
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,826
Thought I'd wait till dark
just in case.

318
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,625
Makes sense.
I don't figure Grey will be back...

319
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,461
...till that arm of his
gets patched up...

320
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,102
...but you never know.

321
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,870
The sooner you get out
of this country...

322
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,836
...the safer you're gonna be.

323
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,340
Here.

324
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,639
I'd like to ride
along with you, Luke...

325
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,679
...but I figure I'm better off
to stay here...

326
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,646
...and look after your ma
and the kids...

327
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,877
...especially after what happened.

328
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,816
Yeah.

329
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,184
Well, I can take care
of myself, Uncle Zeb.

330
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,589
You can if you know
what you're up against, boy.

331
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,490
Sit.

332
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,264
Luke, that man Grey's
a real bloodhound.

333
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,102
He's gonna stay on your trail
till hell freezes over.

334
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,301
There's only one way
you can stay ahead of him.

335
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,275
That's to get up
into the high country...

336
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,005
...and keep moving.

337
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,809
That way you'll keep
ahead of him...

338
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,214
...till I can figure out a way
to get out of this.

339
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,218
How long you figure
that's gonna take?

340
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,357
Well, I don't know...

341
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,151
...but you can't
keep running forever.

342
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,793
As long as you're running...

343
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,156
...your ma ain't gonna budge
off this homestead.

344
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,256
No. No, thanks. I ain't
much of a drinking man.

345
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,500
Then you ain't no Macahan, boy.

346
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,299
I never acquired a taste for it.

347
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,965
Don't say that. Why, your pa
would roll over in his grave...

348
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,508
...to hear you talking
like that.

349
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,168
Your grandpa too.

350
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,041
Why, either one of them...

351
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,682
...could've drunk me
under the table.

352
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,044
Pa?

353
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,446
Sure.

354
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,383
Luke, your pa...
before he married your ma...

355
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,456
...why, he was the biggest
hell-raiser in seven counties.

356
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,593
He used to take me with him.

357
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,694
I was only a 14, 15 year old.

358
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,388
Why, your grandpa,
he used to thump on him regular

359
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,396
...for leading me astray.

360
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,762
Hard to picture pa
as a hell-raiser.

361
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:08,702
Well, he was a lot of things
to a lot of people, Luke.

362
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,172
A good brother to me...

363
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,369
...a good father
to you and the kids...

364
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,344
...a good husband to Kate.

365
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,749
Gotta ask you something, boy.

366
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,391
Your ma...

367
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,686
She told me you were
with Tim when he died.

368
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,227
She didn't say
how you found him.

369
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,130
It was an accident.

370
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,293
<i>I was in Tennessee
looking for him...</i>

371
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,132
<i>...when the Battle of Shiloh
started.</i>

372
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,806
<i>Some Yankees who were
trapped behind Rebel lines...</i>

373
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,275
<i>...grabbed me and put me
in a uniform.</i>

374
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,281
I got no stake in this war.

375
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,648
It's a hell of a place
to be a neutral.

376
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,881
What's your name?

377
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,821
Macahan.
Luke Macahan.

378
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,154
You believe in slavery, Macahan?

379
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,696
No, sir, but l...

380
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,267
That no longer makes you
a neutral for the time being.

381
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,165
I don't believe in war either.

382
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,862
Neither do I.

383
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,668
About, uh...

384
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,810
...Billing's size,
wouldn't you say, sergeant?

385
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,838
<i>I fought most of that day...</i>

386
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,575
<i>...and all of the next.</i>

387
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,743
<i>And I was wounded.</i>

388
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,822
<i>I stumbled into a field hospital.</i>

389
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,197
<i>A hospital.</i>

390
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,731
<i>There weren't any doctors
or any medicine...</i>

391
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,426
<i>...just a lot of men
all shot to pieces...</i>

392
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,936
<i>...and a few rolls of bandages.</i>

393
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,065
<i>I don't know
how long I'd been there...</i>

394
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,041
<i>...when I saw them bringing in
another man.</i>

395
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,691
Pa?

396
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,868
Pa?

397
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,936
Pa.

398
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,576
Pa.

399
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,983
Pa.

400
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,214
Pa.

401
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,291
What are you doing here?

402
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,096
I come to find you, Pa.

403
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,174
What?

404
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,411
Your mother?

405
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,139
Your mother?

406
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,307
She's fine, Pa.

407
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,181
She's fine.

408
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,913
Everybody's fine.

409
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,397
He's dead, boy.

410
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,257
<i>I buried him there under a tree.</i>

411
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,760
<i>And I walked away from the war.</i>

412
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,429
<i>That's why Grey is after me.</i>

413
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,439
That's a damn fool way
for a good man to die.

414
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:07,237
I thank you
for telling me, Luke.

415
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,711
The Army had no cause sending
anybody after you.

416
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,874
You didn't volunteer,
and you wasn't recruited.

417
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,917
You were shanghaied
into the uniform...

418
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,918
...of a dead man.

419
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,760
Your ma was wrong keeping me
from killing that bloodsucker.

420
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,364
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about what you said...

421
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:31,901
...about having to kill anyone
that comes looking for you.

422
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,766
When does it stop, Uncle Zeb?

423
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,907
I mean, if you'd
have killed Grey...

424
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,940
...they'd only send
somebody else,

425
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,873
Maybe somebody harder than Grey.

426
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,377
Luke, they don't come
no harder than Grey.

427
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,209
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

428
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,181
You gotta learn that, boy,
if you want to stay alive.

429
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,344
Now you think you've been
running from the law...

430
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,819
...these last three years.

431
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,457
Well, after what's
happened today...

432
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,093
...it's gonna be a lot worse.

433
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,354
You're in for a hard,
Ionesome time...

434
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,964
...but if you've got the stuff
in you I think you have...

435
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,726
...you're gonna make out.

436
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,596
Yes, sir.

437
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,944
Luke.

438
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,138
You know, it won't be all bad.

439
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,180
You're gonna be riding
the high country.

440
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,510
If you're lucky, you're gonna
get to taste something...

441
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,177
...few men have ever known.

442
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,049
We used to call it
the shining times.

443
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,884
Shining times?

444
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,298
It's kind of hard to explain...

445
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,290
...but when it happens to you,
you'll know it.

446
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,985
You won't ever be
the same again.

447
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,063
You'll ride for days
alone up there...

448
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,564
...in country that's so big
it'll scare you.

449
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,565
And all of a sudden
some morning...

450
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,227
...at the top of the rise
there it'll be...

451
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,933
...a mountain or a valley
or a meadow...

452
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,839
...no white man's
ever seen before.

453
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,606
You'll feel the breath
catching in your throat.

454
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,240
The mountains are holding you
in the palm of their hand.

455
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,751
The melting snows
are dropping waterfalls...

456
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,479
...into lakes
that are so blue...

457
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,647
...it'll make your eyes ache
just to look at them.

458
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,349
Flowers...

459
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,985
...wild and thick,
moving to the pines.

460
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,758
You'll know you're part
of something so overpowering...

461
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,628
...there ain't no words
to describe it.

462
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,565
You felt all that?

463
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,796
Ain't a mountain man alive
ain't felt that...

464
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,634
...more than once, boy.

465
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,902
Hell, that's what keeps all of us
coming back to high lonesome.

466
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,182
Luke, one more thing.

467
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,215
Don't trust nobody.

468
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,580
You've got a price
on your head now.

469
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,722
You're gonna find out
what some people will do...

470
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,949
...for a few dollars.

471
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,986
Keep your powder dry.

472
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,915
It's aawul quiet in here.

473
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,587
Jessie, it's not the time.

474
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,992
Go on, Jessie.

475
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,562
I think it's just what
we need right now.

476
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,873
I'm sorry, Ma.

477
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,602
You know I don't want to go.

478
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,942
Luke, I don't want you to go,
any of us.

479
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:14,482
Ma, don't you understand?
I don't have any choice.

480
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,586
Uncle Zeb is right
about that provost marshal.

481
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,187
He's gonna come back.

482
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,382
And when he does,
Uncle Zeb is gonna kill him...

483
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,220
...or I will.

484
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,986
You will?

485
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,223
It's become so easy to talk
about killing, hasn't it?

486
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,162
Luke?

487
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,029
Are you ready to kill a man?

488
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,797
If it means staying alive,
Ma, yes.

489
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,408
It's different out here.

490
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,172
It's not like it was
back in Virginia.

491
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,077
You're talking just like
your Uncle Zeb.

492
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,808
No.

493
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,016
No, it's something I learned
back there in Missouri...

494
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,454
...when those men tried lynching me
for stealing a horse that I didn't steal.

495
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,890
Well, the difference is you
weren't trying to kill a man.

496
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,498
No, Ma, you're wrong.
I was trying.

497
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,998
I was just so scared
and stiff I missed.

498
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,780
Ma, don't make this any harder
than it already is.

499
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,717
I just can't stay here without
making everything worse.

500
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,857
You know that.

501
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,484
Whew. Oh, it sure is hot,
ain't it?

502
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,092
What do you say we
just put this up for a while...

503
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,888
...and head on down to the swimming
hole and cool off a little?

504
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,930
Ma would have our scalps if we
went off without finishing this.

505
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,068
Besides,
I don't think any of us...

506
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,362
...feel very much like swimming,
Uncle Zeb.

507
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,908
You know,
when it gets hot like this...

508
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,738
...it sure reminds me
of the high country in the fall...

509
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,040
...with the snow sitting down
through the...

510
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,046
Through the trees.

511
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,378
I remember one time
up in Montana.

512
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,750
Well, it was Indian summer...

513
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:35,620
...and we had this early freeze.
Froze real hard.

514
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,886
You girls listening?

515
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,860
You see, we had this
sudden freeze real fast.

516
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,966
There was a little lake
outside there...

517
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,294
...a little lake, and it was
covered over with ducks...

518
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,904
...that had been resting there
overnight on their way south.

519
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,097
Well, I seen them ducks,
and I says to myself:

520
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,471
"Zeb, you're gonna have yourself
a roast duck breakfast."

521
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,044
Well, I aimed and fired.

522
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,239
You wouldn't believe
what happened.

523
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,815
What happened?

524
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,611
Well, them ducks,
they took off...

525
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,651
...took the whole lake
with them.

526
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,345
They took the lake with them?

527
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:09,323
Why, sure, honey. See,
that cold spell come on so fast...

528
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,690
...that it just froze that lake
solid around them ducks' feet.

529
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,228
And when they lifted off...

530
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,662
...they pulled that lake
clean out of the ground...

531
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,302
...and they flew it
to the next county.

532
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,228
Kate, this has got to stop.

533
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,059
I haven't even seen a smile
out of anybody in three days.

534
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,825
Smile? You expect
us to be happy...

535
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,993
...while Luke is out there
running for his life?

536
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,570
Woman, we're not helping
Luke any...

537
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,745
...by going around here
feeling sorry for ourselves.

538
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,033
We gotta do something.

539
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,506
What do you expect us to do?

540
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,077
We can pack up and start heading
for Oregon like we planned.

541
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,238
Why, it's not good for the rest of these
kids to sit around here rotting...

542
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,096
...just because their brother's
on the run.

543
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,131
I told you before, Zeb,
and I'll tell you again.

544
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,426
We are not moving. As painful
as it is for us out here...

545
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,009
...we're staying in case
Luke needs us.

546
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,251
Woman, you are the stubbornest
human being I ever met.

547
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,950
Now what gives you the right
to come here...

548
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,220
...and tell us what we ought to do?

549
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,836
What have you done
for this family...

550
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,037
...since you brought us here
from Virginia? Nothing.

551
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,606
You've been up
in the high country...

552
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,448
...smoking the peace pipe
with the Indians.

553
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,843
We've been breaking our backs
trying to make a life here.

554
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,245
At least you got one thing
straight. I ain't no farmer...

555
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,136
...any more than my brother
Timothy was.

556
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,505
You kept him chained to a plow
every day of his life...

557
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,739
...for 20 years when you knew
he was dying to come west.

558
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,816
How dare you tell me
how Timothy felt.

559
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,919
You haven't the faintest idea
of what goes on...

560
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,578
...between a decent man and woman
who really love each other.

561
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,189
Have you ever
really loved a woman?

562
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,915
All you know is animal lust...

563
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,856
...on a buffalo robe with some
Indian squaw.

564
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,461
Let me tell you something, lady.

565
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,030
There's a lot more animal lust
in all of us, including you...

566
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,962
...than you'd like to admit.

567
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,325
Ma!

568
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,224
Ma. Ma.

569
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,659
Whoa.

570
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,472
Uncle Zeb's in the barn.
He's saddling up.

571
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,032
He says he's leaving.

572
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,965
Well, we can survive without
your Uncle Zeb.

573
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,866
No, he says he's gonna
try and find Luke...

574
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,564
...and bring him back here.

575
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,006
Finish plowing, Laura.

576
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,684
I don't understand, Zeb.

577
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,982
Luke would be in danger
if you brought him back here.

578
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,625
Kate, Luke's life is gonna
be in danger wherever he is...

579
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,385
...as long as Grey's after him...

580
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,051
...except maybe
for a while right now.

581
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,254
Now?

582
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,921
In the beginning
a man on the run...

583
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,431
...can always keep ahead
of the man that's trailing him.

584
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,833
The problem is sooner or later
every man gets tired of running.

585
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,064
It may take a few weeks,
may take months.

586
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,368
When it happens,
he gets careless.

587
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,307
That's what Grey is counting on.
He's gonna stay on Luke's trail...

588
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,037
...and he'll catch up to him.

589
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,977
Luke will fight him,
and Grey will kill him.

590
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,674
What can we do?

591
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,512
There's only one thing
we can do.

592
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:23,983
I tried to tell you earlier...

593
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,115
...but we got to grinding
on each other so hard...

594
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,315
...I couldn't get it out.

595
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,288
I gotta get Luke
and bring him back here...

596
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,100
...so we can all go on
to Oregon together.

597
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,628
- Can you find him?
- I can find him.

598
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,426
I know a few tricks to keep Grey
a week or so behind us.

599
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,534
By the time he gets here,
we'll be gone.

600
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:42,331
What if Grey catches up
to us on the trail?

601
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,940
I just hope this time
you'll stay out of the way.

602
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,576
So we're back to that.

603
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,735
Kill or be killed?
Is that right?

604
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,938
Any of us is capable
of killing, Kate...

605
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,106
...if it's a matter of survival.

606
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,013
Even you.

607
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,814
If killing would save the life
of one of your children...

608
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,182
...you'd kill.

609
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,823
You're wrong, Zeb.

610
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,458
There are other ways.

611
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,595
Lady, one of these days you're
liable to find out different.

612
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,344
<i>In the wake
of the Pilgrims...</i>

613
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,556
<i>...who crossed an ocean
and settled a wilderness...</i>

614
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,243
<i>...in search of religious freedom...</i>

615
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,752
<i>...came dozens of other
religious orders:</i>

616
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,652
<i>Quakers and Shakers,
Bryanites and Dunkers...</i>

617
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,292
<i>...Calvinists and Huguenots...</i>

618
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,519
<i>...all seeking sanctuary.</i>

619
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,028
<i>It is one of the tragic ironies
of our history...</i>

620
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,530
<i>...that these gentle
and peaceful folk...</i>

621
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,896
<i>...merely because
they were different...</i>

622
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,561
<i>...frequently found
not the freedom they sought...</i>

623
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,105
<i>...but a persecution
as ugly and relentless...</i>

624
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,936
<i>...as any they had known...</i>

625
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,045
<i>...in the countries from which
they had fled.</i>

626
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,578
Hey, boys...

627
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,410
...we got us a passel of blackbirds
this time. Just look at them.

628
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,984
Uncle Jacob.

629
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:07,214
Whoo! Hey, will you look
at what we got here.

630
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,985
Come on, woman. Somebody else
I want you to meet.

631
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,930
Now, ain't nobody
gonna hurt you.

632
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,795
No, Joshua.

633
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,334
We must not.

634
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,438
I don't want to be among you.

635
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,903
Among me?

636
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,632
She knows nothing of men.

637
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,141
Well, sure she don't,
living with the likes of you.

638
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,576
Now, you got any hair
under that bonnet?

639
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,080
Oh, I'd sure like to see it.

640
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,615
It is not permitted...

641
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,913
...for a woman in public
to display her hair.

642
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,316
You shut your face!

643
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,550
You gonna take off that bonnet
or do I have to take it off for you?

644
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,193
I cannot.

645
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,022
Well, I can.

646
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,161
Take away your hands.

647
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,462
You heard him.

648
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,935
Now undo it.
Undo it.

649
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,034
Do not make her do this.

650
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,373
You say anything else, I'm
gonna shoot you in the mouth!

651
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:07,313
My father has told you
it is not permitted.

652
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,078
Why, sure it is.
Let me show you, girl.

653
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,448
Let me show you.

654
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:12,953
Please! Please, no!

655
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,097
Come on up here
and take my hat off.

656
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,131
I'll take your head off if you
don't get out of here, mister!

657
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,642
Well, you're talking yourself
into a big mistake.

658
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,374
Now get on them ponies
and get out of here.

659
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,444
Get!

660
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,519
Get the girl on the wagon, sir.

661
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,134
Now, drop those guns.
Drop them!

662
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,875
And get out of here.

663
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,239
Well, what about Willy?

664
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,176
He'll never miss you.

665
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,373
Now, get out of here!

666
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,555
He is dead.

667
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,455
We must take the body into town
and deliver it to the sheriff.

668
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:01,325
You must come with us
and tell what happened.

669
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,726
I can't.

670
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,334
I don't understand.

671
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,629
Tell the sheriff what you saw.

672
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,602
For sure he's not
going to blame you.

673
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,867
You can kill a man
and just ride on?

674
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,908
I have to.

675
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,047
I'm sorry.

676
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,085
Erika...

677
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,458
...you and your brother
go back to the bruderhof.

678
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,160
We'll take care of this.

679
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,838
Yes, father.

680
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,638
God with you, father.

681
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,901
God with you, child.

682
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,172
Got him!

683
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,208
I blowed him clean off his horse!

684
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,608
Let's get out of here
before somebody comes.

685
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,530
Erika, it's him!

686
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,697
No, Joshua, stay here.

687
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,681
What has happened?

688
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,325
Those boys I ran off...

689
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,226
I should have figured
on their saddle guns.

690
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,454
You could be bleeding to death.

691
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,034
Look...

692
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,300
...I want you to do
something for me.

693
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,067
My name is Macahan...

694
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,973
...Luke Macahan.

695
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,738
My Ma's name is Kate.

696
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,776
She lives...

697
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,383
...near Sharp's Town,
on the Platte.

698
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,555
Get a message to her...

699
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,584
...and tell her what happened.

700
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,792
If I'm dead...

701
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,363
Please, do not talk anymore.

702
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,127
I will see to it if need be.

703
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,367
But first, I'm taking you
to the Bruderhof.

704
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,836
Figure that to be
a waste of time, miss.

705
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,273
That is up to God, not you.

706
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,706
Joshua, help me!

707
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,791
Bishop Benjamin!
Father Elias!

708
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,601
Someone help me, please!

709
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,565
Mother Tice!

710
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,501
Erika, who is this man?

711
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,671
I found him on the road, Bishop.

712
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,072
He's called Macahan.

713
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,941
He has been gunshot.

714
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,944
We are bound to help him.

715
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,582
It is our law.

716
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,682
Erika, fetch Mother Tice.

717
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,224
Have her bring pliers
for a bullet.

718
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,361
Take him inside.

719
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:33,866
He has no bullet,
it has passed through.

720
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,902
But he has lost much blood.

721
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,399
I cannot say that he will live.

722
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,042
We will pray God that he does.

723
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,272
You will care for him,
Mother Tice?

724
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,004
All that I am able, child.

725
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,481
But I'm in the middle of midwife
for Mrs. Brand, poor thing.

726
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,749
I will tend him.

727
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,323
Erika, you are unmarried.
How will it look?

728
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,594
It be fine, Mother Tice.

729
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,559
It be just fine.

730
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,928
You mean you never stayed
to see if he was dead?!

731
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,731
Well, there was somebody
coming, Pa!

732
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,964
We was afraid they'd see us!

733
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,507
How do I know you ain't
telling a lie about shooting him?

734
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,838
How do I know you didn't tuck
your tails 'tweenst your legs...

735
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,140
...run like a scared dog
after he killed your brother?

736
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,806
Well, Pa, I swear on Willy's grave
I hit him square.

737
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,349
I knocked him clean
off his horse!

738
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,817
- Now, ain't that right, Jake?
- Ah, it's true, Pa.

739
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,683
He was lying right there
in the dirt.

740
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,324
Then where's his body?

741
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:29,754
Uh, well...

742
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,689
...eh, somebody must've took it, Pa.

743
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,193
"Somebody must've took it, Pa!"

744
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,591
Who?!
The sheriff ain't got it!

745
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,062
Nobody's seen it!

746
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,463
Maybe somebody around here
collects corpses...

747
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,569
...stacks them around his house
like cordwood.

748
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,034
You reckon that's it, Charlie?

749
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,672
You reckon that's it, Charlie?

750
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,569
No, Pa, no!

751
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,006
I'll tell you why you didn't
find him.

752
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,009
Because he ain't dead,
that's why.

753
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,843
Somebody must have
some reason for hiding him.

754
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,008
Wait a minute.

755
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,280
Them blackbirds. Them blackbirds
the ones that found him!

756
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,253
No, that can't be, Pa.

757
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:04,326
It was them that brought
Willy's body in to the sheriff.

758
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,520
They'd have said something
if they found that other fella.

759
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,358
Yeah, he's right, Pa.

760
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,501
You know how they are
about shooting and such.

761
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,568
Hell, they didn't even raise
a frown when...

762
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,762
...when we were teasing that girl!

763
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,166
Now...

764
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,345
...if that's the truth,
there's only one thing left...

765
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,710
...he's hurt and he's crawled off
somewhere to lick his wounds.

766
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:30,614
If he's hurt as bad as you think he is,
he ain't gone far, neither.

767
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,482
Now, I want him found!

768
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:36,490
I want y'all boys to go search
every cabin, every gully...

769
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,393
...every shack until you find
the man that killed your brother!

770
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,930
Well, we'll find him, Pa!
Yeah!

771
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,227
If he's dead, I wanna know it!

772
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,735
But if he's alive...

773
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,340
...wouldn't that be pretty?

774
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,361
I never figured hell for angels.

775
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,598
Maybe I'm not dead.

776
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,870
But you'll be fine.
Just fine.

777
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,381
Considering I never expected
to wake up at all, I guess I must be.

778
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,817
For two days we did not think
you would live.

779
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,049
But the last two days,
you've slept like a lamb.

780
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,250
I've been out for four days?

781
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,191
On Thursday you were among us
for a few minutes...

782
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,992
...and took some soup from
Mother Tice.

783
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,634
You do not remember?

784
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,860
Heh, no.

785
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,165
But I remember you.

786
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,437
My name is Erika...

787
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,844
...but you must call me
Miss Hanks.

788
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,816
Yes, Miss Hanks.

789
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,251
I will get you some food.

790
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:21,957
Where's my gun?

791
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,690
I do not know.
There was only this.

792
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,068
Those men find out I'm not dead,
they're gonna come looking for me.

793
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,266
- They will not come here.
- Why not?

794
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,104
This is the Bruderhof.

795
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,540
The what?

796
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,408
The bruderhof.

797
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,073
Except it is not really
a bruderhof yet.

798
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,684
Just a town where no one lived...

799
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,878
...and we stopped here because
many of our people were ill.

800
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,856
Are you gonna stay here?

801
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,358
It has not yet been decided.

802
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,123
But we are building a church.

803
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:58,734
And if we stay, we must also
build a wall to keep the world out.

804
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,132
It is the way of the Simonites.

805
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,966
Simonites?
That what you're called?

806
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,938
Yes, after Simon Peter.

807
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,840
You have read the New Testament?

808
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:14,211
My ma used to read the Bible
to us every night.

809
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,511
Mr. Macahan, the Elders...

810
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,745
How did you know my name?

811
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,048
When I found you...

812
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,090
...you asked that the word of your
death be sent to your mother.

813
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,083
Did you?

814
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:30,765
No. You did not die, praise God.

815
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,732
Praise God.

816
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,701
What were you saying about
the Elders?

817
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,433
The Elders held a council...

818
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,406
...try and decide if a man
of violence...

819
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,307
...should be allowed to
remain among us.

820
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,041
L... I'm not a man of violence.

821
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,015
You killed a man.

822
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,984
Yeah, for trying to kill me.

823
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,784
And I'd do it again
if it came to it.

824
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,859
You do not understand.

825
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:02,089
It is not important why you shot,
only that you did.

826
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,063
We do not hold with violence
in any form.

827
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:08,136
We do not fight.
We do not resist.

828
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,795
No matter what?

829
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,304
No matter what.

830
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,601
You mean those two Simonite
men on the road...

831
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,644
My father Elam,
and my Uncle Jacob.

832
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,179
Your father and your uncle?

833
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,682
You mean they would have
stood by and let those men...

834
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,183
...have their way with you?

835
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,912
Yes.

836
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,547
Well, how do you feel
about that?

837
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,387
I agree with them.

838
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:37,193
But how could any man
stand by and let that happen?

839
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,301
It is our way.

840
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,336
God's law is our law.

841
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,268
Scripture tells us:

842
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:48,070
"And if any man sue thee
at the law, and take thy coat...

843
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,974
...let him have thy cloak, also."

844
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:54,048
We take God at his word,
Mr. Macahan.

845
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,777
You take God at your peril,
Miss Hanks.

846
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:00,684
A man could do much worse.

847
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,882
Why, if everyone thought that way...

848
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:06,028
...well, there wouldn't be anyone
around to keep law and order.

849
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,823
If everyone practiced that...

850
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:11,694
...there would be no need
for anyone to keep law and order.

851
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,170
You haven't told me
what the Elders decided.

852
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,904
What everyone knew
they would decide in the beginning.

853
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,014
You will remain here
until you are better...

854
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,173
...and then you must leave.

855
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:32,947
Well, I sure hope they let you
look after me until that happens.

856
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:36,058
It is my hope, too,
Mr. Macahan.

857
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:47,860
<i>Generations of Americans...</i>

858
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:50,870
...<i>have viewed the Indian</i>
<i>as either the noble Red Man...</i>

859
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,270
<i>...a pure and innocent
child of nature...</i>

860
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,469
...<i>as uncomplicated as the</i>
<i>wilderness in which he lived...</i>

861
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,978
<i>...or as a half-naked
and barbaric savage...</i>

862
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,310
<i>...whose cruelty knew no bounds.</i>

863
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,315
<i>Neither concept is true.</i>

864
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,784
<i>The Indian,
like any man or nation...</i>

865
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,219
<i>...was a mixture of many qualities.</i>

866
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:11,417
<i>Before his lands were usurped
and his people decimated...</i>

867
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,687
<i>...he was a loyal friend
to the white man.</i>

868
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,127
<i>The Pilgrims survived a winter
of starvation...</i>

869
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,290
<i>...thanks to the kindness
of the Indian.</i>

870
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:22,097
<i>And Lewis and Clark, dying,
were rescued by the Nez Perce...</i>

871
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,571
<i>...but just as the white man dealt
in deceit with the Indian...</i>

872
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,836
<i>...so not every overture of apparent
friendship by the Indian...</i>

873
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:34,973
<i>...toward the settler could be
taken at face value.</i>

874
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,277
Pretty lady...

875
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,750
...we come to water our horses.

876
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,355
You're always welcome
to our water.

877
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,993
Where is your man, pretty lady?

878
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,193
He's out hunting, chief.

879
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,133
Strange, I never see your man.

880
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,002
He's... gone most of the time.

881
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,609
He does not like to farm, huh?

882
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,804
He's very much like the Shoshone,
he's a hunter.

883
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:10,817
It is not good to leave a woman and
young ones alone in this country.

884
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,512
You need a man, pretty lady.

885
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,385
The Arapaho are near.

886
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,118
We cannot watch over you always.

887
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,058
We are not the eagle in the sky.

888
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,165
You need a man.

889
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:29,800
This is Mountain-Is-Long.

890
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:33,807
Good fighter. Good hunter.
Good man. All man.

891
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,238
Why, I know, Chief, but l...

892
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,572
Ride for pretty lady. Ride!

893
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:39,576
Hyah!

894
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,950
Hyah!

895
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,116
Yah! Yah!

896
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:20,855
See! Good fighter! Good man!
Plenty babies! Good!

897
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,986
I know, chief. But I told you,
I have a man.

898
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,594
Macahan? Macahan good.

899
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,698
Macahan fine, good, smart.

900
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,494
But not man for woman!

901
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:35,137
His home is there.

902
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,932
He not stay long in house.

903
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,233
Oh, not Zeb.

904
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,400
Another long knife.

905
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,570
A warrior.
A very good warrior.

906
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,580
Where is this good warrior,
pretty lady?

907
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,550
He's... He's on his way now.
Any day.

908
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,712
Next sun.

909
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,358
Maybe two suns.

910
00:59:56,526 --> 01:00:01,828
We go hunt now.
Come back, see this long knife.

911
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,660
Goodbye pretty lady.
Pretty girls.

912
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:22,046
Mother,
do you think he believed you?

913
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,218
Do you?

914
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,946
I don't know.
I had to say something.

915
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,386
He's a very determined man.

916
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:29,616
I don't know.

917
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,228
That mountain-Is-Long
looked strong as a fort.

918
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,057
And plenty babies!

919
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,704
A kid!

920
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,509
Boy, you know how close you come
to getting your throat slit?

921
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,345
What the hell
is the matter with you?

922
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,747
I'm... I'm sorry, mister.

923
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,960
I was chasing a deer
and I thought your horse was...

924
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,953
Well, you damned near killed
my horse!

925
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,560
Not to mention me!
You near shot off the best part of me!

926
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:41,390
I didn't mean to, mister.
It was an accident.

927
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:51,238
I ain't done with you yet!
Now don't budge until I am!

928
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,068
Oh, easy boy.

929
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,536
Easy, now.

930
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,713
He pulled a tendon.

931
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,446
He'll ride again,
but it's gonna be a day or two.

932
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:10,889
You're lucky, boy.

933
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,789
If I had to put him
out of his misery...

934
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,260
...I'd be tempted to do the same
for you.

935
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,422
What were you doing
skulking around here anyway?

936
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,364
Any questions to be asked,
I'll do the asking.

937
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,902
- You live around here?
- Why?

938
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,870
Because I need somewhere
to tend to my animal.

939
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,670
Not to mention myself.

940
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,939
Come on, get up
and start walking. Come on.

941
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:42,354
What's your name, boy?

942
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,255
Give me an answer
before you get tromped.

943
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,056
Macahan.

944
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,825
<i>Cowboy, range war, gunfighter.</i>

945
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,969
<i>The words were almost unknown to
the settlers of the northern plains...</i>

946
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,401
<i>...where the great cattle
drives up the good night...</i>

947
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:59,541
<i>...and the Chisholm Trails
had not yet begun.</i>

948
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:03,270
<i>But from time to time, a strange
and unique breed of men...</i>

949
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,641
<i>...who lived and died by the gun...</i>

950
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:09,342
<i>...drifted north out of the vast
plains of Texas.</i>

951
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,352
Now, get a move on,
we ain't got all day.

952
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:17,618
Josh is forever promising catfish.

953
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,785
Next time he cooks
his own breakfast.

954
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,658
How can you eat those things,
Jessie?

955
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,322
They're so ugly.

956
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,866
Out here you appreciate
what you get, Laura.

957
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,368
Well, it's not for me, Jessie.

958
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,404
I was born a female...

959
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,702
...a feminine girl, and that's
what I am to stay!

960
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,607
Slopping pigs, and uh,
eating catfish...

961
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,975
...and staying bent over
a hot stove all day...

962
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,878
It's just not for me.

963
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,848
That's what you're willing
to settle for.

964
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,853
Laura, I want the same things
you want.

965
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:51,389
But they're just gonna have to wait.

966
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:02,467
Besides, doesn't look as though you
have much choice, does it?

967
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,015
Jessie! Jessie, bring the rifle.

968
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,983
It's Josh!

969
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,258
Mister, I wanna know
why my son's on foot...

970
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,960
...and you're poking him like sheep.

971
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:38,470
You tell her, boy.
And tell her straight.

972
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:43,044
I lost all the hide I can stand to
your family's marksmanship.

973
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,236
Well, Josh?

974
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:47,541
I was tracking a deer
and it went into some trees.

975
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,617
I saw something moving and...

976
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:50,945
...I thought it was the deer.

977
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,715
You mean you came close
to shooting this man?

978
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,155
He done a might better
than come close, ma'am.

979
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,988
Shouldn't have been messing around
there anyway, Ma.

980
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:01,527
It was a mistake, and I'm sorry.

981
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,824
He just knocked a little bark
off me is all.

982
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,558
It's my horse, though.
It come up lame.

983
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,703
Put the horses in the barn, Josh.

984
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,428
Wait a minute, Ma.

985
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,835
- I don't trust him.
- Why?

986
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,033
Coming here, he asked
too many questions.

987
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,178
I didn't mean no harm, ma'am.

988
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:22,545
If I did, that boy'd be
back there gathering ants.

989
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,481
Sorry about the rifle.

990
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,282
Don't ever apologize about
doing the sensible thing, ma'am.

991
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,185
Anderson's the name.

992
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,620
What are you gawking at?

993
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,317
That man, he's handsome.

994
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:35,430
I apologize for Josh.
He's a good boy.

995
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,226
Well, if you say so.
He's your son.

996
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:40,130
Did he say he nicked you?

997
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,964
Well, the first shot
just blew a kiss.

998
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,935
But the second one did sting some.

999
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,734
Well, maybe I could put
some, ah...

1000
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,501
...salve where the bullet hit you.

1001
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,478
I'm afraid I'd have to know
you some better...

1002
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,240
...before I could ask you
to do that.

1003
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,213
Well... The medicine's in the house.

1004
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:56,817
You can put it on.

1005
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,922
You're welcome to spend the day,
Mr. Anderson.

1006
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,529
I mean it's plain your horse isn't
ready to travel.

1007
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:11,826
Either are you.

1008
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,095
Thank you, ma'am.

1009
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,432
Evening, Louie.
Well, I see you got fed.

1010
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,404
Liver! I hate liver!

1011
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:03,651
They know I hate liver, sheriff.
They do it on purpose.

1012
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:10,054
Well, Louie, maybe it's just their way
of trying to keep you out of here.

1013
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,456
You know, you spend more time
in this place than I do.

1014
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:15,756
The very reason you ought to
treat me better.

1015
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:18,764
This is cruel and
unusual punishment.

1016
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:20,993
Come on, Louie.

1017
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:31,376
Oh! I forgot!

1018
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,606
Somebody was looking for you.
A friend of yours.

1019
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,944
Who?

1020
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,988
He told me his name and I forget...

1021
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:43,751
...big fella, nine feet tall.

1022
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:46,554
All dressed up in
buckskin with fringes on it.

1023
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:47,991
Yeah, Zeb Macahan.

1024
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:50,132
Yeah! Yeah, that's it.
That's the one.

1025
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:53,530
Biggest man I ever seen.
Been looking for you since noon...

1026
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,226
...said it was important.

1027
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,598
Well, where is he?

1028
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:04,537
That's terrible. I never heard
anything like that in my whole life.

1029
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,341
Well, uh, if I'm lying,
I'm dying.

1030
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:10,212
Now old Mormon Jake,
you know he got to the bend...

1031
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:13,082
...at the trail and he turned around,
figuring how lucky he was...

1032
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,882
...to still have his head,
you know...

1033
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:17,082
...and he looked back and there's
that old bear...

1034
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,920
...standing in the middle
of the trail...

1035
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,187
...and he was grinning from
ear to ear...

1036
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:24,799
...and he's waving at old Jake
like that to come forward.

1037
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:29,370
Come on, bartender. This is a
honest-to God Arapaho scalp.

1038
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:32,632
Took no more than a month ago when
we wiped out them hostiles at Black River.

1039
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,605
You know, old Jake,
he always figured that...

1040
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:39,271
...the bear had done fell
plumb in love with him.

1041
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,313
Oh, Zeb, let's you and me
get out of here...

1042
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,452
...and go someplace where
we can be alone, huh?

1043
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,086
Well, now,
that sounds good, Delilah.

1044
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:47,347
But what about these other
pretty ladies here?

1045
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,151
Oh, that's okay, honey,
we'll just all come with you.

1046
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:51,985
Sounds good.

1047
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,755
Bartender, this Arapaho scalp...

1048
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:58,957
...is worth four bottles,
but we're gonna offer it to you two.

1049
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,966
Sergeant, I'm gonna tell you again...

1050
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,105
...we don't deal in no scalps.

1051
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:06,264
And them that does is the...

1052
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,103
Is what, bartender?

1053
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:10,302
Is dead!

1054
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:18,114
Well, well, if it ain't the
Indian lover, Mr. Macahan.

1055
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,687
We thought we took care of you
at the Black River.

1056
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,623
Did you take that scalp?

1057
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,525
Why not? It were not good
to the woman I got it from.

1058
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,241
I wanted that colonel's scalp,
mister...

1059
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:16,707
...but I'm gonna heap the Arapaho...

1060
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:20,172
...but I reckon yours will do.

1061
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,748
Ah!

1062
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:31,092
Sorry, Zeb.
I just couldn't let you do that.

1063
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:52,309
Mama, why don't you ask
Mr. Anderson to be your man?

1064
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,176
What?

1065
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,318
The man you told Claw about.

1066
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:59,648
Maybe if Mr. Anderson were just
to stay here a couple of days...

1067
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:03,053
I couldn't ask a stranger
to do something like that.

1068
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,022
Laura could.

1069
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,560
She thinks he's handsome.

1070
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,499
Now, listen, girls...

1071
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:15,467
...I don't want anyone telling Mr.
Anderson about Claw and his braves.

1072
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,003
Remember that.

1073
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,471
Josh, tell Mr. Anderson
supper's on the table.

1074
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:23,805
Ma, I think you're making...

1075
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,970
Josh.

1076
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,812
Yes, ma'am.

1077
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,390
Mrs. Macahan...

1078
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:11,617
...I haven't eaten anything
like this since...

1079
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,126
...well, I can't remember how long.

1080
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:17,997
Salt pork and refried beans...

1081
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,931
...that's about as close to
real food as I ever get.

1082
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:24,300
I'm glad you enjoyed it,
Mr. Anderson.

1083
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:28,603
Mr. Anderson,
where are you from?

1084
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:32,144
No place in particular,
I move around a lot.

1085
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:34,179
What kind of work do you do?

1086
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,376
Most anything that comes to mind.

1087
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:41,319
Meat hunting
and uh, prospecting.

1088
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:47,258
I'll even punch a cow
or wrangle a horse if I have to.

1089
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:50,990
The fact is, this is about as
peaceable an evening as I've had.

1090
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,568
And pleasant too.

1091
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,396
Real pleasant.

1092
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,769
And...

1093
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,740
...hard as it is to say...

1094
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,012
...I best be pushing on.

1095
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:08,809
Oh, well, Josh says your horses
aren't ready to travel yet.

1096
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,612
You're in no condition to travel,
either.

1097
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,856
I can't really argue with you there,
ma'am, but...

1098
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,050
...I've already stayed on
longer than I should.

1099
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,526
You're welcome to the barn,
Mr. Anderson.

1100
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:30,737
I apologized for Josh's bad manners.

1101
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,204
Oh, that's all right, ma'am.
He's just prideful.

1102
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,071
Boy without a pride
ain't worth a damn. I mean... -

1103
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,270
We get the meaning, Mr. Anderson.

1104
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,184
Clear the table, girls.
I'll show Mr. Anderson the barn.

1105
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:46,549
Ma, maybe I should fetch
Mr. Anderson a blanket.

1106
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,852
Oh, l... I'll do that, Laura.

1107
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:57,422
If I had known all this was gonna
come my way...

1108
01:13:57,599 --> 01:14:01,865
...just for getting creased by a little
old bullet, I'd have volunteered.

1109
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,617
It's a beautiful night.

1110
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,022
You know...

1111
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:30,427
...I spent a good deal a time
sleeping under the sky.

1112
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:34,558
It's funny, you never seem to
notice the stars when you're alone.

1113
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,261
I know.

1114
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:45,245
Mrs. Macahan.
Who's Claw?

1115
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,214
How do you know about Claw?

1116
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:53,548
Well, there's been a lot a mysterious
whispering going on between your girls.

1117
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:57,756
Claw's a Shoshone chief,
and he's a very good friend.

1118
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,560
He feels I need a man
to protect me...

1119
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:03,493
...and he's dead set on me
marrying one of his braves.

1120
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:09,128
Well, Mrs. Macahan, I don't want to
throw a spook into you...

1121
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:13,468
...but that chief might be
interested in your welfare.

1122
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:17,173
On the other hand, he might just be
trying to go one up on the Arapaho.

1123
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,711
The Arapaho?

1124
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,248
Yeah, Arapaho consider this
their land.

1125
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:25,944
But if the Shoshone could get one
of their braves in here permanent...

1126
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:29,056
...that would give them a good
foothold in Arapaho territory.

1127
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:32,159
I'd just be mighty careful
if I were you.

1128
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:46,330
You know, I'd like to stay on here
for, a couple of days.

1129
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,172
It's just not for the cooking.

1130
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:52,739
I'd like to, but I can't.

1131
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,983
You're on the run, aren't you?

1132
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,912
I might just be
in an aawul big hurry.

1133
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:04,115
I know the look.
My oldest son, Luke, is on the run.

1134
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,921
He has a look he never had before.

1135
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,687
Well, that's the look you get.

1136
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,636
I keep running into men
that like to shoot guns.

1137
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:22,237
And, sometimes, people get hurt.

1138
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:25,811
Why you telling this to me?

1139
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,877
I just want you to know how bad
it is before you I kiss you.

1140
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:46,127
I've been a widow for three years,
Mr. Anderson.

1141
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:51,431
I'm not about to take on just
any man passing through.

1142
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:55,138
I never apologize for doing
the sensible thing.

1143
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:01,682
Good night, Mr. Anderson.

1144
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,841
Good night, ma'am.

1145
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:09,147
Sleep sound.

1146
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,118
Aren't you ever going to sleep?

1147
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,553
Maybe not.

1148
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:45,090
At least not till he's gone.

1149
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,955
You're still fretting about that.

1150
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:50,326
He's a stranger, Jessie! And we don't
know anything about him.

1151
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:56,463
You invite him in here, you feed
him, you laugh at all his jokes.

1152
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,469
It was because of you
he had to lay over.

1153
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,200
I'm surprised he didn't invite himself
to sleep in the house...

1154
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,434
...instead of the barn!

1155
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,908
He seems all right to me.

1156
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,048
The fact is, it's been kind of nice
having him around.

1157
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,410
Haven't seen Laura get that
fluttery in a long time.

1158
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,449
Did you see the way
he was looking at Ma?

1159
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,087
And the way Ma was looking at him?

1160
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,984
Well, what's so wrong with that?

1161
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,489
It's hard on Ma here!
It can get lonely.

1162
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,752
Mr. Anderson's just passing through.

1163
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,863
There's no reason why Ma can't
enjoy him being here.

1164
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:25,465
It's been good seeing her laugh.

1165
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:28,933
She hasn't laughed like that
since Pa.

1166
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,732
She has it coming to her, Josh...

1167
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:34,171
...so you just quit your meddling.

1168
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,796
Mr. Macahan, you should not
be about.

1169
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:58,557
Your stitches are not healed.

1170
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,760
Aw, I just got tired
of lying in that bed.

1171
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,165
It's a lot nicer out here.

1172
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:05,805
But it is too soon.

1173
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:07,532
You are stubborn, Mr. Macahan.

1174
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,143
Hey, why don't you call me Luke?

1175
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:11,836
It is not permitted.

1176
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,311
Well, what do you permit
around here?

1177
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:15,507
Whatever is plain.

1178
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,478
Well, then, they ought not
to permit you...

1179
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:21,849
...because you sure aren't plain.

1180
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,719
Please, Mr. Macahan,
you must not speak so.

1181
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,861
Well you believe in truth, don't you?

1182
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,121
That's just the plain truth.

1183
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,727
If you were strong enough
to come here by yourself...

1184
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:38,600
...I think before long you will be
well enough to leave.

1185
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,800
Yeah, I guess so. Though the thought
don't pleasure me none.

1186
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:43,274
Why not?

1187
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,846
Well, you know, the more I see
of you people, the more I think...

1188
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,283
...maybe you got the right idea
about things.

1189
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,352
We live quietly and with God.

1190
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:54,182
There's nothing wrong with that.

1191
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:57,621
A man could do worse
than spend a lifetime here.

1192
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,988
Some would tire of it.

1193
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:01,789
Naw, I wouldn't.

1194
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,932
I grew up on a farm,
not too different from this.

1195
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,068
It's the only peace
and quiet I ever knew.

1196
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,429
Why did you leave?

1197
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,538
Well, we decided to come West...

1198
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:13,003
...the war...

1199
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:18,012
<i>Always afraid we'd get caught up in it.</i>

1200
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,513
<i>We were bound for Oregon when it hit.</i>

1201
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:25,642
<i>Seven weeks out of Virginia
we were in the Nebraska Territory...</i>

1202
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,155
<i>...we ran into a detachment
of cavalry.</i>

1203
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,657
Major Anderson, out of Fort Randall.

1204
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,229
Zeb Macahan, major.
This here's my kin.

1205
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:39,629
Zeb Macahan? Weren't you scouting
for Colonel Hyatt at Fort Laramie?

1206
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:42,235
What you doing this far east?

1207
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:44,531
Well, I was about to ask
you the same thing.

1208
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,197
We were ordered back
to join General McDowell.

1209
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,708
War's broke. Full force.
Where you coming from?

1210
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:52,176
Virginie.

1211
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:53,974
I reckon you left just in time.

1212
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,049
Why do you say that, major?

1213
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:59,512
Union forces have crossed through
Maryland to Virginia.

1214
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,316
General McDowell's at Manassas
with 30,000 men.

1215
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:06,085
General Beauregard with 20,000
coming up from the South.

1216
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,126
Bull Run in the middle.

1217
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,854
Bull Run?

1218
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:15,196
It's where we come from.
We got family back there.

1219
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:19,636
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, good luck to you.

1220
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:22,641
- Macahan.
- So long, major.

1221
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,680
<i>I guess after the major left...</i>

1222
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:34,080
<i>...we were all thinking
the same thing.</i>

1223
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:40,593
<i>We just couldn't leave the folks
back there in the middle of a battlefield.</i>

1224
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:42,354
You going back.

1225
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:47,226
Laura, fetch me a sack
full of hardtack and dried beef.

1226
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:51,236
- But...
- Go on now, girl, fetch it.

1227
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:52,771
- Josh!
- Yes, sir.

1228
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:56,001
Fetch me some ammunition.

1229
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:59,078
Tim, I'll be the one going back.
You stay here with the family.

1230
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:02,739
This is hard country, Zeb.
You can buck it.

1231
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,614
Comes that they'll be needing
you more than me.

1232
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:08,312
Long way to go if you expect to beat
the rebel troops.

1233
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,424
I reckon I can make it
in three weeks.

1234
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,719
Seven hundred miles, Tim,
to Bull Run.

1235
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,623
I'm going, Zeb.

1236
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:20,767
What about the folks?
What if they still won't leave?

1237
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,335
Figure that when I get to it.

1238
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,439
Pa. Good luck.

1239
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,837
Zeb said he'd go back.
And you have a family here.

1240
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,307
What happens to the children if you
don't ever come back?

1241
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:31,809
Please, let Zeb go.

1242
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,174
It's you I'm thinking of.

1243
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,645
You stand a better chance out here
with Zeb than with me.

1244
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:37,808
- Timothy!
- Now, Kate, listen to me.

1245
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,224
Kate, out here I'm a tenderfoot.

1246
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,518
Zeb can find game and water.

1247
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:48,993
He can read when a storm's
brewing, he knows the Indians.

1248
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:50,324
I don't know any of that.

1249
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:54,493
Out here all alone I could...
I could get all of us killed.

1250
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,800
Now Zeb's the one
that's got to stay.

1251
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,675
You can understand that, can't you?

1252
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:07,373
Here, Pa.

1253
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:10,211
<i>I remember my sister</i>
<i>bringing him food...</i>

1254
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:13,786
<i>...and him giving half of it back
cause we were short of rations.</i>

1255
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:15,445
Pa, that's not near enough.

1256
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,181
Laura, I'll make out.

1257
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,953
Take care of them, Zeb.
I'll find you wherever you are.

1258
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:22,096
We'll be here.

1259
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:24,288
We're not gonna go on
another foot without you.

1260
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,457
Next Spring we'll go on
to Oregon together.

1261
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,932
Kate, you can't stay here.

1262
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:32,267
He's right, Kate. We can't stay out
here for the winter.

1263
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,736
Tim, I figure we're about
ten days from the Platte.

1264
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,468
No, we'll go on there
and wait for you.

1265
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:40,978
There's a town there. There's supposed
to be a telegraph coming in.

1266
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,639
We'll leave word.

1267
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:45,782
They'll be all right.

1268
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,885
We'll be waiting for you, Pa.

1269
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,352
<i>It was the last time any
of us, except me...</i>

1270
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:24,151
<i>...was to see Pa alive.</i>

1271
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:26,759
<i>Yankees put him in uniform and...</i>

1272
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:30,227
<i>...I found him by accident,
dying of wounds at Shiloh.</i>

1273
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:33,730
It is so hard to lose a parent.

1274
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:37,533
I remember how I felt
when my mother died.

1275
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:43,036
We must accept, Mr. Macahan...

1276
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,576
...we are all God's servants.

1277
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:48,512
God sure found a fine servant
when he picked you.

1278
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:51,844
I'm pleased you think me worthy.

1279
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,818
You're much more than worthy, Erika.

1280
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:04,724
The bell... I must go now.

1281
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:21,714
Glad to see you moving, Zeb.

1282
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,908
I was afraid
I might have hit you too hard.

1283
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:28,078
Oh... That you that hit me, huh?

1284
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:31,692
Heh, heh. Well, you didn't
give me a whole lot of choice.

1285
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,556
Look to me like you was about
to kill that sergeant.

1286
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,857
Well... Oh...

1287
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:43,231
I gotta admit I was...
I was trying. Where's he at?

1288
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:47,067
He's on his way to the Fort Hospital.
You broke his jaw in three places.

1289
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,906
How long you gonna keep me
locked up?

1290
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:51,943
Ha! You ain't no prisoner, Zeb.

1291
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:53,580
Bartender told me what happened.

1292
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:54,806
Oh...

1293
01:25:56,518 --> 01:26:00,716
Not even no lectures
on disturbing the peace?

1294
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:03,255
No, I think I'll leave that
up to the Army.

1295
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,324
They're outside waiting for you.

1296
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:09,725
Oh, now look, Ephraim,
before I talk to them...

1297
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,297
...I gotta ask you something.

1298
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:14,765
I'm looking for a young fella,
he's a boy about 23.

1299
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:18,201
Good looking fella, about six foot.
I lost his trail here about...

1300
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:19,397
...about 20 mile out.

1301
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:21,439
I thought maybe
you might've seen him.

1302
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,338
Real fast with a gun?

1303
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:24,511
Fast enough.

1304
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,909
Wouldn't also be a deserter
from the Army, would he?

1305
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:28,139
Why?

1306
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,784
Well, because an Army provost
marshal was here this morning.

1307
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:33,386
He's looking too.

1308
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:35,785
Where'd this here provost marshal
head for?

1309
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:39,620
He's on his way to a Simonite
village out the Old Post Road.

1310
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:41,159
What for?

1311
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:43,593
Well, because a boy
answering the description...

1312
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:47,565
...that both of you gave me
shot a man on that road ten days ago.

1313
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:48,929
Did he kill him?

1314
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:52,038
Yeah. Yeah, he was trying to protect
a Simonite girl...

1315
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:55,199
...who was being roughed up
by a bunch of hooligans.

1316
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:59,312
Do you think the boy could be
out at this here Simonite village?

1317
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,880
So unlikely I didn't even look.

1318
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,141
Where's my horse?

1319
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:04,945
Right outside.

1320
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,284
Thanks, Ephraim.

1321
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,446
Any time at all, Zeb.

1322
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:16,721
You Zeb Macahan?

1323
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:17,898
That's right.

1324
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,660
You're a dangerous man, Macahan.

1325
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,963
I've got four troopers who swear
to the fact you tried to kill them.

1326
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:27,164
Yeah, and they was trying to trade
an Indian scalp for whiskey.

1327
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:28,809
A woman's at that.

1328
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,639
Gonna try to arrest me, lieutenant,
you better get on with it.

1329
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:33,906
I'm not here to press charges,
Macahan.

1330
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,915
Do you know a mountain man
called Cully Madigan?

1331
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,848
Cully Madigan? Why?

1332
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,214
As of last week...

1333
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:44,654
...Madigan had killed and scalped
over two dozen Arikara braves.

1334
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:48,461
I don't believe you.

1335
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,564
You can believe what you like,
Macahan.

1336
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:53,360
But I got 50 crack troopers
camped outside of town.

1337
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:55,434
And I've got order to find Madigan.

1338
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:58,197
- And what are you gonna do then?
- I'll hang him.

1339
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:01,536
Well, I don't think Cully Madigan's
been killing Arikara.

1340
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:04,075
But I'll tell you something,
lieutenant, if he has...

1341
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:07,009
...he ain't been doing it
without a damn good reason.

1342
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:08,409
Then he is a friend of yours.

1343
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:10,073
He's more than a friend.

1344
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:14,187
When I picked him up, he didn't know
a beaver plew from a possum tail.

1345
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:15,652
Then maybe we could work a deal.

1346
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,085
Meaning?

1347
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:19,249
I'll find Madigan, Mr. Macahan...

1348
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,486
...but it might take me a while.

1349
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:23,790
In the meantime,
if he keeps on killing...

1350
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,627
...we might have an Indian war
on our hands.

1351
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,234
Get to the point, boy.

1352
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,893
The point is, he's your friend.

1353
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:33,507
If you find him before I do,
you might save some lives...

1354
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:36,109
...and keep Madigan from the gallows.

1355
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:38,871
Son, there ain't a man alive's gonna
bring Cully Madigan in...

1356
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:40,708
...if he don't wanna come.

1357
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:42,315
But you could stop the killing.

1358
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:45,543
All right, if I did,
would you call off the search?

1359
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,484
I'm not sure I can.
I have my orders.

1360
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:50,214
Then forget the whole thing.

1361
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:57,665
Just to keep the record straight,
I'm gonna tell you something else.

1362
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,663
You may get Cully
eventually, lieutenant...

1363
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,632
...but before you do,
he'll kill more of your soldier boys...

1364
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:03,964
...than he has Arikara.

1365
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:07,130
All right, Macahan,
you have my word.

1366
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:10,937
Now, do I have yours?
You'll go after Madigan immediately?

1367
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:12,442
No, you don't.

1368
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:15,776
All you got is my word I'll get
to it as quick as I can.

1369
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:19,181
I got urgent business gotta be
took care of first.

1370
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:34,399
Luke!
What is a provost marshal?

1371
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:36,833
He's a kind of a law officer
for the Army. Why?

1372
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:40,337
Because there is a provost marshal
here and he's looking for you.

1373
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:42,271
Ah, Erika, let him take me.

1374
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:43,963
I've caused you
enough trouble already.

1375
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:47,275
No. He is a violent man
and he has guns and...

1376
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:50,679
We must hide you quickly!
Now, come with me.

1377
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,012
Oh.

1378
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:11,163
The shooting took place almost
two weeks ago...

1379
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:12,738
...on the road to town.

1380
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,065
Why would you believe
that he was here?

1381
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,404
Because he protected
one of your women.

1382
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,045
I think you might be protecting him.

1383
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,113
Bu the killed a man.

1384
01:30:21,816 --> 01:30:25,912
If you know of our laws, you would
know that they're against violence.

1385
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,582
Could we have among us a man
who had killed another?

1386
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:31,987
Maybe not, brother.
But I'll look myself.

1387
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,155
Take the horse, boy.

1388
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:37,995
Now, stand out of the way...

1389
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:41,761
...or we may have some of that
violence you're so dead set against.

1390
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,845
Over there.

1391
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,885
Why does this provost marshal
look for you?

1392
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:44,095
I ran away from the Army because I...

1393
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:45,960
...I couldn't stand the killing.

1394
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:49,296
You left the war
because you could not kill?

1395
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:54,407
Oh, Luke, I have great hopes for you.

1396
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:51,831
That horse belong
to the provost marshal, son?

1397
01:32:51,999 --> 01:32:55,992
- Yes, sir.
- And the man he's looking for, is he here?

1398
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,336
It is not permitted to say.

1399
