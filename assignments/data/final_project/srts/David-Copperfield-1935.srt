<i>(BETSEY) What.?
(DR CHILLIP) The baby is a boy.</i>

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:13,205
A boy? A boy!

<i>(DAN) You're most welcome,

Let's always be friends, Emily.</i>

<i>(YOUNG EMILY) I'd like that,

<i>(STEERFORTH) Stings, don't it.?
(YOUNG DAVID) A bit.</i>

11
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,636
You're as fresh as a daisy.
My name is Steerforth, by the way.

12
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,501
There's no need to "sir" me.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,074
<i>(CREAKLE) It grieves me to tell you
that your mother is very ill</i>

14
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,713
<i>She is very dangerously ill</i>

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,975
In fact, she's dead.

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,713
<i>(PEGGOTTY)
Listen to me, my darling boy.</i>

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,518
<i>Don't lose heart, and never forget
how much your Peggotty loves you.</i>

18
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:05,064
<i>(MICAWBER) I am convinced
that you will, in short, go far.</i>

19
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:10,065
To Copperfield.
Not just a lodger - a friend.

20
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,032
I never will forget you.

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,133
<i>(BETSEY) You broke her heart,
then punished the boy,</i>

22
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:19,573
because of your own guilt!

23
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:26,949
Oh, Mr Dick. You'll consider yourself
joint guardian with me of this boy.

24
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,849
<i>I think perhaps
he should take the name Trotwood.</i>

25
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,550
<i>(MR DICK) Trotwood Copperfield.!
(BETSEY) Trotwood Copperfield.!</i>

26
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:37,253
Perhaps you'll be
a partner in Wickfield's business one day.

27
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,625
Oh, no, Master Copperfield.
Ambition ain't for me.

28
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,069
<i>A person like myself
had better not aspire.</i>

29
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,002
Do not concern yourself.
I will look after him.

30

They're beautiful flowers,
Mr Copperfield.

Come. Join us.

Trotwood!

66
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,851
Agnes! How wonderful
to receive your invitation.

67
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,691
We see you so rarely these days.

68
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:29,096
My dear sister, I've so much
to tell you about what I've been doing.

69
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,333
Uriah. How are you?

70
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:38,705
Much obliged for your condescension
to an 'umble person, Master Copperfield.

71
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:46,011
Take no notice of me. I am invisible.

72
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,621
Things have changed
since you left, Trotwood.

73
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,282
Papa is to make Uriah his partner.

74
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,386
- But he's not to be trusted!
- Uriah has made himself indispensable.

75
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,564
I have a good mind to...

76
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,998
Promise me you'll do nothing
to offend Uriah.

77
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,368
You fell in love on the spot.

78
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,239
More than that.
I completely and utterly adore her.

79
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,436
But what about you, Agnes?

80
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,049
Have you no admirers
to tell me about?

81
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,210
Of course not.
I have no time for anything like that.

82
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,083
Have you seen
the new play at Covent Garden?

83
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,382

You don't remember me.
David Copperfield.

00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,000
My God! Little Copperfield!

87
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,695
- I'm overjoyed to see you.
- You haven't changed a bit, Daisy.

88
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,532
This is Miss Wickfield, an old friend.

89
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,270
Delighted. You have the prettiest girl
in the place on your arm, Daisy.

90
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,312
Why do you call him "Daisy"?

91
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,348
Merely a nickname from school
You don't mind, do you, Daisy?

92
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,814
Not in the least.

93
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,352
I'm staying at my mother's.
You must call on me.

94
00:05:55,555 --> 00:06:00,652
I want to know what you've been doing.
I feel as though you're my property.

95
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,491
Of all people! What luck.

96
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,100
Sometimes it is wiser
to leave the past alone.

97
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,099
Perhaps you shouldn't go to see him.

98
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,434
Why not? He's the best friend
I ever had in the world.

99
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,886
Going home, Master Copperfield?

100
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,219
Indeed, Uriah. Perhaps you would care
to join me for some coffee?

101
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,657
<i>Oh, really, Master...
I mean MisterCopperfield.</i>

102
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,994
I'm sure you wouldn't want
a 'umble person like me in your house.

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,498
I wouldn't ask you if I didn't.

104
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,668
Do you remember saying to me once

105
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:53,336
that perhaps I should become a partner
in Mr Wickfield's business one day?

106
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,446
What a prophet you have
shown yourself, Mr Copperfield.

107
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,980
I don't suppose
I really thought it likely.

108
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,752
Oh, who would have?

109
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,791
But the 'umblest persons
may be the instruments of good.

110
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:13,422
Mr Wickfield is the worthiest of men,
but, oh, how imprudent he has been.

111
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:17,432
- Has he been imprudent?
- If anyone else had been in my place,

112
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,764
Mr Wickfield would have been
under his thumb by now.

113
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:25,069
Without me, there would have been
loss and disgrace,

114
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,008
and Mr Wickfield knows it.

115
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,415
Did you think Miss Agnes
looked very beautiful tonight?

116
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,023
I thought her looking
as she always does,

117
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,387
superior to everyone around her.

118
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,229
Thank you.
Thank you very much for that.

119
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,593
Why should you thank me?

120
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,258
You will not think the worse
of my 'umbleness

121
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,339
if I make you a little confidence,
Mr Copperfield?

122
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,737
Of course not.

123
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,642
The image of Miss Agnes
has been in my breast for years.

124
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,839
Oh, with what pure affection
do I love the ground she walks on!

125
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,017
Does she know of these feelings?

126
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,644
Oh, no! Oh, dear, no!

127
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:14,759
You see, I'm just emerging
from my lowly station,

128
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,762
but I rest my hope
on my usefulness to her father.

129
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,902
She's so much attached to him,
she may come, on his account,

130
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,233
to be kind to me.

131
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,603
If you'll keep my secret
and not go against me with my Agnes,

132
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,680
I will take it as a particular favour.

133
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,646
You wouldn't wish
to make unpleasantness.

134
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,620
Who knows what
the consequences might be?

135

(CLOCK STRIKES)

136
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,924
Dear me. One o'clock.

137
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,525
My boarding house
will be locked by now.

138
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,930
<i>Dear Agnes.</i>

139
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,668
<i>Too loving and good
for anyone I could think of.</i>

140
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:09,543
<i>Was it possible she was reserved
to be the wife of such a wretch as this.?</i>

141
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,648
You walk at a somewhat
lively pace, Mr Copperfield.

142
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,224
I wouldn't want you
to miss your coach.

143
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,021
I'll be back with the law
next time, Micawber!

144
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,095
Mr Micawber!

145
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,835
Open up, it's Copperfield!

146
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,838
Mr Micawber! It's David Copperfield!

147
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,106
(MICAWBER) Is it possible?

148
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,410
Have I again the pleasure of beholding

149
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,919
the infant scourge
of the pawnbroking profession?

150
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,856
Come in, come in.

151
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,789
Mr Heep.

00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,795
Any friend of Copperfield's
is a friend of Wilkins Micawber.

153
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,566
(MICAWBER) My dear!
There is a gentleman here

154
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,835
who wishes to be presented to you!

155
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,475
Copperfield, come to renew
his acquaintance with you, my love.

156
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,084
Lord, can it really be?

157
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,709
Oh, what happy memories
of my youth!

158
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,355
Oh, here!

159
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,491
Oh, I...

160
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,654
You may perhaps have surmised

161
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,233
that Mrs Micawber is in a state of health
which renders it not improbable

162
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,995
that there will be soon be
an addition to the infantine group.

163
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,833
In short, she is expecting.

164
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,804
It is a happy event,

165
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:47,242
though one that strains Mr Micawber's
already depleted resources.

166
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,678
But I know that he will,
as always, rise to the challenge.

167
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,184
We must celebrate.
Will you come to dinner next week?

168
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,380
Oh! A noble and generous proposition.

169
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,822
<i>If I had listened to Agnes's advice,</i>

170
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,057
<i>if I had never taken up
Steerforth's invitation,</i>

171
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,000
<i>many honest lives would have
continued untouched by tragedy.</i>

172
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:16,268
<i>But I was blind to her wisdom then,
as I was blind to so many things,</i>

173
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,636
<i>and it was with
nothing but joy in my heart</i>

174
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,508
<i>that I went to visit my old friend
at the house he shared with his mother</i>

175
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,216
<i>and her companion, Rosa Dartle.</i>

176
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,420
James has told you he is
an Oxford man now, Mr Copperfield?

177
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,959
I am sure he will make you proud
and take a high degree.

178
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,996
My dear Daisy, I doubt whether
I shall bother to take a degree at all

179
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,066
Don't torment me, James.
You know you will

180
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,828
There is no better mind
in the whole college.

181
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,633
You must forgive Mother.
She is quite horribly vain about me.

182
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,240
But you give her
every reason to be, do you not?

183
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,177
We hardly see you, and surely that
can only be because you work so hard?

184
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:02,247
Ah, good, the claret.
Daisy, this is Littimer, my manservant.

185
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,049
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance, sir.

186
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,125
I trust I find you well tonight.

187
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,319
Very well, thank you.

188
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,598
How will you spend
your holiday, Mr Copperfield?

189
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,860
I intend to visit my old nurse.
I haven't seen her in years.

190
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,733
Her brother lives in a boat
on Yarmouth Sands.

191
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,932
You remember him. He and his
nephew visited me at Creakle's once.

192
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,307
I think I have some recollection.
Rustic types, weren't they?

193
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,971
Their home is a magical place.
You really ought to see it.

194
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,209
Ought I? Well, why not?

195
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,750
I have nothing else very pressing.
I'll come with you.

196
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,616
- Do you mean it?
- Certainly!

197
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,622
It might be amusing
to mix with that sort of people.

198
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,162
But do tell me. "That sort of people".

199
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,697
Are they really animals and clods
and beings of another order?

200
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,664
- I would so like to know.
- They're not as sensitive as we are.

201
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,635
I dare say
they are wonderfully virtuous,

202
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,766
but their natures are very coarse.

203
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,435
Their delicacy is not to be
shocked or hurt very easily.

204
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,448
Really? It's so consoling to find
that when they suffer, they don't feel!

205
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:11,717
Sometimes I have been quite uneasy
for "that sort of people".

206
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,827
But now I shalljust dismiss
the idea of them altogether.

207
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,055
(HARP BEING PLAYED)

208
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,538
I was fascinated by Miss Dartle,

209
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:32,733
and the strange hold
she had over Steerforth.

210
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,014
Don't stop, Rosa.

211
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,866
You haven't played for me in years.

212
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:32,228
Come, Rosa. From now on
we shall love each other very much.

213
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,470
- What happened?
- You have to be careful with Rosa.

214
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,708
She is always dangerous.

215
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,250
Have you noticed
that remarkable scar on her lip?

216
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,354
Of course.

217
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,492
I did that.

218
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,390
I was a young boy
and she exasperated me,

219
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,225
so I threw a hammer at her.

220
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:06,028
What a promising young angel
I must have been!

221
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:25,187
This is delightful, Daisy.
Just the tonic for a weary soul

222
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,989
(DAVID) I don't believe you are
half as jaded as you say.

223
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:33,097
I don't believe you can possibly be
as honest and good as you pretend.

224
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,428
Not compared to you, at any rate.

225
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,833
I'll see you back at the inn when
you've grown tired of being cried over.

226
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,686
Does Mr Barkis still
go over to Blunderstone, ma'am?

227
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,952
He do, but he's bad abed
with the rheumatics.

228
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,563
I want to see an old house.

229
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,027
The Rookery, I think it's called.

230
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,836
My darling boy!

231
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,066
Peggotty!

232
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,841
It's better than a pint of liniment
to see you again, Master Davy.

233
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,051
What was the name
I wrote up in the cart, sir?

234
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,020
We had some grave talks
on that matter, didn't we?

235
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,386
I was willing a long time.

236
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,257
A long time, Mr Barkis.

237
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,331
I don't regret it.

238
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:47,996
C.P. Barkis is the usefullest
and the best of women.

239
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,768
All the praise that anyone
could give C.P. Barkis

240
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,037
she deserves, and more.

241
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,412
I'm a poor man, sir.

242
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,485
And I am sorry to hear it.

243
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,951
Very poor indeed.

244
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,457
Old clothes.

245
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:13,826
I wish it was full of money,
but it ain't. It's old clothes.

246
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,464
I understand.

247
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,567
Barkis has grown
a little nearer with time.

248
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:45,186
<i>I remembered Mr Peggoty's boat
as a quiet, homely place,</i>

249
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,389
<i>but as Steerforth and I approached,</i>

250
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:51,299
<i>it soon became clear
that this was no ordinary night.</i>

251
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,700
(SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER
FROM INSIDE)

252
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,435
(DAN) This is the happiest day
of my life!

253
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,772
Master Davy, it's Master Davy!

254
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,673
(HAM) Master Davy!
(DAN) Davy boy!

255
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:11,087
Mr Peggotty, this is Steerforth,
an old friend from school

256
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,659
- You don't look a day older.
- Good to see you after so long.

257
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,422
Why that you two
should come to this here roof

258
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,862
tonight of all nights of my life.

259
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,035
What do you think, then?
What do you think?

260
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,864
Only that this girl,
who I brought up from a baby,

261
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,374
and loved better than a daughter,
only that she's going to be married!

262
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,638
Emily!
(DAN LAUGHS)

263
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,314
My warmest congratulations.

264
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,111
And who is the lucky fellow?

265
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:46,591
- Ham!
- Who else but Ham?

266
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,390
Two years past, he asked her
and she comes to me

267
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,723
and says she couldn't have him.

268
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,866
"Him that I've known so intimately
all my life," she says.

269
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,594
"And loved like a brother,
I can never have him."

270
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,862
And that was the end of it.

271
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,908
Until tonight, when he comes crying out
to me alljoyful, "She'll be my wife!"

272
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,809
And she says, "Yes, uncle. I've
changed me mind, if you please."

273
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,782
If I please!

274
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,785
I'd lay down my life for Emily.

275
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,051
She's all to me that ever I can want.

276
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:26,856
There ain't a gentlemen in all the land,
nor yet sailing upon the sea,

277
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,559
that can love his lady
more than I love her.

278
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,293
Ham.

279
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,072
I give you joy. May you always
be as happy as you are tonight.

280
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,174
<i>(STEERFORTH) He's
a chuckle-headed type for the girl</i>

281
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,475
You're not with
Miss Dartle now, Steerforth.

282
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,950
I could see for myself
how much you liked him.

283
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,057
You see clean through me, Daisy.
I am defenceless against you.

284
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,400
Thank you.

285
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,981
Emily!

286
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,795
I'm not good enough for Ham.
I'm cross and changeable with him

287
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,729
when he is never so to me.

288
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,564
Why am I so often harsh when all
I should think of is making him happy?

289
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,504
You do make him happy.
Anyone can see that.

290
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,974
It would have been better
if he'd found someone else.

291
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,203
Ham would rather die
than be with anyone but you.

292
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,074
Don't say that!

293
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,408
I'm not worthy of him!

294
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,019
I should be a hundred times
more thankful for his goodness.

295
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:33,853
I should feel what a blessed thing it is
to be the wife of a good man

296
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,687
and to lead a peaceful life.

297
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:40,696
Once you are married, all these
worries and fears will fall away.

298
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,008
- What do you think of her, Daisy?
- She's handsome enough. Why?

299
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,312
I've just bought her.

300
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:06,049
- But you might never come back.
- I don't know about that.

301
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,784
I find I've taken a fancy to the place.

302
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,861
She must be newly-rigged, though.

303
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,487
I'm leaving Littimer behind
to see it done.

304
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,863
I've decided to give her
a new name - "The Little Em'ly".

305
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,817
(DAVID) All she ever wanted
was to love and be loved in return.

306
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:38,412
Think on the happy times, Davy.
Not what came after.

307
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,859
<i>I felt many emotions
as I lingered by my mother's grave,</i>

308
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,829
<i>but it was the thought of Dora
that stirred me from my melancholy.</i>

309
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:52,926
<i>Reflecting on the past, I knew with
certainty that my future lay with her</i>

310
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:57,073
<i>and that I could not rest
until I had declared myself.</i>

311
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,280
If your poor mother
could see you now,

312
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,978
she'd be that vain her pretty head
would be completely turned.

313
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:22,033
Goodbye, Peggotty. When I come back,
I'll have important news for you.

314
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,897
- What news?
- I'm going to be married.

315
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,538
Only the lady in question
doesn't know it yet.

316
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,938
- Who is she?
- Dora. Her name's Dora!

317
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,544
My darling boy!

318
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,045
(COACHMAN) Go on!

319
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,525
Steerforth?

320
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:59,433
I wish to God I had had a judicious father
these last twenty years.

321
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,466
I wish with all my soul
I had been better guided.

322
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,306
I wish I could guide myself better.

323
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,778
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, Daisy, nothing.

324
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,521
I am bad company for myself
sometimes, that is all

325
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,056
If anything should ever separate us,

326
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:25,687
you must promise me
that you'll think of me at my best.

327
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,856
- Will you do that?
- Why should we ever be separated?

328
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,398
Just promise me, can't you?

329
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,063
Remember me at my best.

330
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,207
<i>Never more would I
touch his hand in friendship,</i>

331
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,912
<i>never more hear his laughter or feel
the warmth of his companionship.</i>

332
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:56,418
<i>May God forgive you, Steerforth.
I cannot.</i>

333
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,636
My dear Copperfield!

334
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,867
This is luxurious.

335
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:17,713
A way of life which reminds me
of a period when I was myself a bachelor.

336
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,284
Happy days, now, alas, gone forever.

337
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,752
- Micawber! Have I deserved this?
- Deserved what?

338
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,653
- You wish that we had never married.
- My love!

339
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,624
This is my reward, Mr Copperfield!

340
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,822
- I who will never desert him!
- Forgive me, Emma!

341
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,731
I am a wife and mother,
and I swear I never will desert him.

342
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,862
My dear, no one is urging you
to do anything of the sort, least of all me.

343
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:46,009
- You don't regret our nuptial vows, then?
- Impossible! Unthinkable!

344
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,805
Oh...

345
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,805
- Sit down, my dear.
- Yes.

346
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,543
Ah! Shall I do the honours,
Copperfield?

347
00:25:56,288 --> 00:26:00,588
Are you aware, Mr Copperfield,
that we are shortly to leave the metropolis

348
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,285
to cast our lot among strangers?

349
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:07,022
In short, Copperfield,
something has at last turned up.

350
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,392
Where?

351
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,762
I have recently
entered into arrangements

352
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:16,907
by virtue of which
I stand pledged and contracted

353
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:21,078
as a confidential clerk
to a mutual friend.

354
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,644
Heep.

355
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,443
A man of remarkable
shrewdness and perspicacity.

356
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,951
I am convinced
Micawber will flourish in a situation

357
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,023
so suited to his fertile resources.

358
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,528
I am sure he will be a judge,
or even a chancellor, one day.

359
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,301
To Copperfield,
the companion of my youth.

360
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:48,337
And to Heep, my friend and protector.

361
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,501
<i>The time had come to know my fate.</i>

362
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,409
<i>I called on Dora at the first opportunity.</i>

363
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,642
<i>Happiness or misery
was now the question,</i>

364
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,084
<i>and only she
could give the answer to it.</i>

365
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,314
Be quiet, you naughty boy!

366
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,822
I came here today to tell you...

367
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,791
Jip! Quiet, please!

368
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,458
- I came here today to tell you...
- Jip, come back here! Bad boy!

369
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,493
Mr Copperfield!

370
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:28,138
I came here today
to tell you that I love you.

371
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,311
I have loved you
since the first moment I saw you

372
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,677
and I will always love you.

373
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,720
- We hardly know each other!
- One minute was enough.

374
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,426
I love you, Dora.

375
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,619
With all my heart.

376
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,299
Forgive me.

377
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,029
I shall go now.

378
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,333
Please don't.

379
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,343
Dora...

380
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:16,018
Aunt! Mr Dick!

381
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,054
I'm ruined.

382
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,530
Betsey Trotwood - I don't mean
your sister, Trot, but myself -

383
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:31,731
had a certain property and
for years that property did pretty well

384
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,102
and returned good interest.

385
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,641
But her man of business,

386
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,616
being no longer the man
of business he once was,

387
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,722
she took it into her head
to remove it from his hands

388
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,015
and invest it for herself.

389
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:52,456
First, she lost it in the mining way.

390
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,225
Then she lost it
in the shipping and banking way.

391
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,734
And finally, she lost the lot.

392
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,166
And the least said about it,
soonest mended.

393
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,571
- Is Mr Wickfield to blame for this?
- The blame is entirely my own.

394
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:12,048
Well, the cottage is let
at 70 pounds per annum,

395
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,217
which is all which we have to live on.

396
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,983
So here we are, my dear Trot.

397
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:23,060
And you haven't a penny in the world!
What do you have to say to that?

398
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,253
You know I've often
thought about writing.

399
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,522
Mm?

400
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:30,156
I could work in the mornings
before I go to Doctor's Commons.

401
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:36,036
- And I have 100 pounds a year.
- Which you should keep for yourself.

402
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:41,078
- We must meet our reverses boldly.
- Boldly!

403
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,713
Boldly. And not suffer them
to frighten us.

404
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:51,215
We shall act the play out
and live misfortune down!

405
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,085
- A beggar? Love a beggar?
- I am now a beggar.

406
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,859
How can you be such a silly thing
and sit there telling stories?

407
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:07,061
- I'll make Jip bite you.
- This must be our secret for now.

408
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,696
I cannot speak to Mr Spenlow
about our engagement

409
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,536
until I've begun to make my fortune.

410
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:16,374
A secret engagement?
How romantic, Doady!

411
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,241
When we are married,

412
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,647
if our income is to be small,
we must try to be practical

413
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,619
Please don't be practical
because it frightens me so.

414
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,157
If you will sometimes
look at your papa's housekeeping

415
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,053
and perhaps study cookery...

416
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:33,197
You are determined
to frighten me out of my wits!

417
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:37,765
With perseverance and strength
of character, we can bear anything.

418
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,871
But I haven't got
any strength. Have I, Jip?

419
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,573
Oh, do kiss Jip
and stop being so disagreeable.

420
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,509
Jip will have to wait his turn.

421
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,051
I will feel happier when I've spoken
to Mr Wickfield about our situation.

422
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,919
And no doubt you will be
glad of an excuse to see Agnes.

423
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:05,392
I can't feel comfortable until I know
her opinion of my engagement to Dora.

424
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,626
Oh. So you imagine yourself
in love, do you?

425
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,234
Imagine?

426
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:14,064
Yes, I suppose you think
you were made for each other,

427
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,536
and are to go through
a children's party kind of life

428
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,667
like two pretty pieces of confectionary!

429
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,107
Blind, Trot, blind!

430
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:28,311
We are young and inexperienced,
I know, but we love one another truly.

431
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,081
And she's neither silly
nor light-headed, I suppose?

432
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,780
Dora is fascinating
and sweet and beautiful

433
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,493
Blind, Trot, blind.

434
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,263
<i>Returning to Canterbury,</i>

435
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:49,372
<i>I felt Agnes's gentle influence
reaching out to me.</i>

436
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:53,238
<i>It seemed to pervade
even the city in which she dwelt.</i>

437
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,938
<i>Yet as I approached
Mr Wickfield's house,</i>

438
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,641
<i>my happiness gave way
to a growing sense of dread</i>

439
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,183
<i>about what I might find within.</i>

440
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,322
(DOOR BEING CLOSED)

441
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,454
This is a bad business of your aunt.

442
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,396
I came here to discover
if anything might be done.

443
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,027
Nothing, Mr Copperfield,
nothing at all

444
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,265
It's all gone
and no one is to blame but herself.

445
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:29,004
She has been very reckless.
Isn't that right, Mr Wickfield?

446
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,081
Quite right.

447
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:36,819
You'll stay with us, Trotwood,
while you remain in Canterbury?

448
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:42,618
Uriah is a great relief to me.

449
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:48,992
It's a load of my mind
to have such a partner.

450
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,907
My dear Copperfield!

451
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,381
So how do you like the law,
Mr Micawber?

452
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,645
It is a great pursuit, sir.

453
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,984
To a man of higher imaginative powers
such as myself,

454
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:17,527
it is perhaps over-reliant on detail

455
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:23,667
A mind is not at liberty to soar
to any exalted forms of expression.

456
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,133
Still, it is a great pursuit.

457
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,340
Do you see much of Mr Wickfield?

458
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,943
Mr Wickfield is a man
of very excellent qualities...

459
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,542
...but he is, in short, obsolete.

460
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:41,173
I am afraid his partner
seeks to make him so.

461
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,411
My dear Copperfield.

462
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,423
I am here in the capacity
of confidence and trust.

463
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,724
The discussion of some topics,
even with Mrs Micawber herself,

464
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,958
is incompatible with the functions
now devolving upon me.

465
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,194
Do not ask, 'umble as I am,

466
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:04,033
to speak of the affairs
of my friend Heep.

00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,592
(FOOTSTEPS)

468
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:35,300
Wouldn't you say my Ury
is quite the gentleman these days, sir?

469
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,771
Indeed, Mrs Heep.

470
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,806
(WHISPERING)
How long has she been living here?

471
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,145
- Months.
- Does she never leave you alone?

472
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,253
It is certainly difficult
to avoid her company.

473
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:58,956
My dear sister.
I have missed you so much lately.

474
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,657
I wanted to talk to you
about Dora.

475
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,627
We are to be married.

476
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,670
She is the most wonderful girl
in the world

477
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,865
and I know that you
will come to love her as well as I do.

478
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,842
How could I not love anyone
who thinks so much of you?

479
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:19,075
Promise not to abandon me
when I become an old, married man.

480
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,377
You know how I rely on you.

481
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,678
It is Dora you must rely on now.

482
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,780
Of course.

483
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:32,555
I will always be
your devoted friend and sister, Trot.

484
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,860
Wherever our separate paths
may lead us, you may rely on that.

485
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,467
(AGNES) Shall we retire, Mrs Heep?

486
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,814
Father, go to bed soon.

487
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,830
I'll give you a toast, gentlemen.

488
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,234
To the divinest of her sex.

489
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,445
I'm a 'umble individual
to give you her health,

490
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,514
but I do admire, no, adore her.

491
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,845
Choose some other toast, Uriah.

492
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:31,486
Agnes Wickfield,
the divinest of her sex.

493
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,884
Who else can propose it
if not the man who would be her husband?

494
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,329
Never! Never!

495
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,593
Have you gone mad, Wickfield?

496
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,959
I have as good a right to her
as any other man.

497
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,900
I have a better right
than any other man.

498
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,678
Look at my torturer.

499
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:59,405
Always at my elbow,
whispering his venom.

500
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,882
In my house, in my business...

501
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,080
Like a millstone around my neck,
bringing me to my ruin!

502
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,191
Take care, Wickfield!

503
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,727
Without me you would have
no house or business, nor reputation.

504
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:15,660
(WICKFIELD WAILS)
Your safety is in my hands, remember?

505
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,003
Oh, what have I come to, Trotwood?

506
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,175
My weak indulgence has ruined me.

507
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:31,004
God knows what I have done
in my misery of oblivion!

508
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:56,367
Have you ever picked a pear
before it was ripe, Mr Copperfield?

509
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,065
What?

510
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,041
I did that when
I spoke of Miss Agnes.

511
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,149
But the pear will ripen yet.

512
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,853
I can wait.

513
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:21,592
There must be two parties
to a quarrel, Copperfield.

514
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,459
And I won't be one.

515
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:41,576
- Father is quite recovered.
- Is there nothing that can be done?

516
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:46,246
His first words when he woke
were to send apologies to Uriah.

517
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,086
- He is more in his power than ever.
- Promise me one thing.

518
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:54,321
Promise me you will never sacrifice
yourself to a mistaken sense of duty.

519
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,559
Agnes, you can't be
considering marriage to that...

520
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,633
...reptile!

521
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,967
Goodbye, Trotwood.

522
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,282
<i>My return to London
was tormented by thoughts</i>

523

<i>of the fate that lay in wait for Agnes.</i>

524

and the final success of his scheming.</i>

525
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,260
<i>It was with a heavy heart
that I made my way</i>

526
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,226
<i>to Mr Spenlow's office
at the Doctor's Commons,</i>

527
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,664
<i>only to find that
a further catastrophe awaited.</i>

528
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:35,429
You have abused my confidence and
committed a dishonourable action!

529
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,270
- I love Dora to such an extent...
- Miss Spenlow, if you please!

530
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:43,976
And I beg that you won't
speak to me of love or engagements.

531
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:48,042
My daughter is not
to be thrown away on a clerk!

532
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,621
Now let there be
an end to this nonsense.

533
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:55,317
Take these letters away
and throw them on the fire.

534
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:59,120
You must forget her, Mr Copperfield!

535
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,639
<i>Soon after this disastrous encounter,</i>

536
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:20,944
<i>a letter arrived from Peggotty informing
me that Barkis was in a very poor way</i>

537

<i>and she feared he would soon
be making his final journey.</i>

538
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,086
<i>I resolved to go
to Yarmouth immediately,</i>

539
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,354
<i>though not before attending
to the matter closest to my heart.</i>

540
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,031
I'll never give Dora up

541
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,261
and the sooner Mr Spenlow
knows that, the better.

542
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,229
I'll see him this morning
on my way down.

543
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,321
Mr Spenlow?

544
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,060
Mr Spenlow?

545

<i>Mr Spenlow's death from a heart
seizure threw everything into confusion.</i>

<i>I was desperate to see Dora,</i>

547
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,982
<i>but she blamed her attachment to me
for her papa's untimely end.</i>

548
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,283
She cannot see you, Mr Copperfield.

549
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:39,752
The floodgates of sorrow are open
and her grief is not to be assuaged.

550
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:43,628
If I could just send her a note
or a token of my sympathy...

- How is he, Peggotty?
- He is fading fast.

This is kind of you, Master Davy.

555
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,992
Uncommon kind.

00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:19,793
Barkis, my dear. Here's Master Davy,
who brought us together!

557
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,531
Old clothes!

558
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,343

He's going out with the tide.

560

No better woman anywhere.

564
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,527
Barkis is willing.

565
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:59,897
I have looked over Mr Barkis's will
and opened the box.

566
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:05,607
- There was over 3,000 pounds inside.
- 3,000?!

567
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,836
He leaves the interest
on 1,000 to Mr Peggotty

568
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,710
and the rest goes to you.

How should I spend it without you?
Don't I want you now more than ever?

and now I'm told so!

00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,275
My duty here is done.

607
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,386
I'm going to seek my niece.
That's my duty now.

608
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,188
Why do you come here.
What do you want of me?

609
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,230
I want to know if he will do
as he promised and marry her.

610
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,959
Impossible.

611
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,004
A marriage to someone
so far below him

612
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:33,303
would destroy his career and
ruin his prospects. It will never happen.

613
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,441
If there is any other compensation...

614
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:44,087
You offer me money as compensation
for my niece's disgrace and ruin?

615
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,290
What compensation can you make for
opening a pit between me and my son?

616
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,755
What is your love to mine?
What is your separation to ours?

617
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:54,293
My son has been
the object of my life.

618
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:58,562
My every thought has been devoted
to him, his every wish indulged.

619
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,963
And now he takes up
with a miserable beggar girl

620
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,936
and repays my devotion
with deception.

621
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,675
You speak of your injury?

622
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:11,780
I come here with no hope,
and I take none away.

623
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,742
Good day, ma'am.

624
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,480
You do well to bring him here!

625
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,786
He's deeply injured,
though you don't seem to know it.

626
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:26,386
I would have his house torn down
and see her branded on the face!

627
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,022
If I could hunt her
to the grave, I would do it.

628
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,232
Chances are they're
in foreign parts by now.

629
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,239
The sooner I go,
the quicker I'll find them.

630
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,276
You know where I may be reached.

631
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,211
Look out for yourself, old girl

632
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:51,114
I've got my garden and a little money
now, Dan. Don't worry about me.

633
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,347
If any hurt should come to me,

634
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:58,859
remember the last words I left for
my child were "love" and "forgiveness".

635
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,171
(DOOR BEING CLOSED)
Aunt!

636
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,213
You remember Peggotty?

637
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,875
For the love of God, don't call her
by that South Sea island name!

638
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:26,352
She married, didn't she?
What is your name now, Pegg...?

639
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,717
Barkis, ma'am.

640
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,756
You see, that's human.

641
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:34,487
It sounds less as if
you needed a missionary.

642
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,424
We are older than we were, I see.

643
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:44,230
How are you, Barkis?
I am heartily sorry for your loss.

644
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,211
Thank you, ma'am. I'm quite well

645
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,042
Oh, yes! Yes, Mr Dick.

646
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,956
It came from Doctor's Commons
while you were away, Trot.

647
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,151
The firm has collapsed
with heavy debts.

648
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:10,264
Mr Spenlow was bankrupt.
There is nothing left.

649
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,432
Does this mean
Miss Spenlow is destitute?

650
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,002
- I must go to her.
- Oh, Trot!

651
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,230
Oh, Mr Dick!

652
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,374
Shh... That's all right.

653
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,183
It's all right.

654
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,615
I shall take care of you now.

655
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,415
You are still mine, aren't you, Dora?

656
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,688
Of course I am!

657
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:41,295
It's just that I am so frightened!

658
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,925
There's no need to be afraid.

659
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,161
But we have nothing!

660
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,704
We have everything.

661
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,487
<i>I took with fear
and trembling to authorship.</i>

662
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,629
<i>I wrote a little something
and sent it to a magazine.</i>

663
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,264
<i>It was published.</i>

664
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:18,367
<i>I wrote more and quickly began
to make a steady income,</i>

665
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:22,233
<i>enough for Dora and I
to contemplate the future with optimism.</i>

666
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,406
(COACHMAN) Whoa!

667
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,251
I have forgotten what relation
Agnes is to you, Doady.

668
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:40,947
No blood relation, but we were
brought up like brother and sister.

669
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,560
Dora.

670
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,604
Agnes is so warm and kind.

671
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,899
I was quite frightened of her before,

672
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:00,634
but now I feel so calm
and peaceful in her company.

673
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,678
I wonder that you
ever fell in love with me.

674
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,407
How could I see you
and not love you?

675
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,384
Don't you think that if I had been
her friend a long time ago,

676
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,511
I might perhaps
have been more clever?

677
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,287
You would prefer me
if I was, wouldn't you?

678
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:20,395
- What nonsense!
- Is it, Doady? Are you sure?

679
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,739
<i>And so we were married.</i>

680
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,216
<i>The bridesmaids were gone
and the celebrations were over,</i>

681
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,812
<i>and Dora and I
were left alone at last.</i>

682
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,657
Are you happy now, you foolish boy?

683
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:11,408
But Doady, what shall I do with this?

684
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,381
Jump, Jip.

685
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,984
My love, do you think Mary Anne
has any idea of time?

686
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,520
- Why, Doady?
- Dinner should be at five. It is now six.

687
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:24,388
<i>I doubt whether two young birds could
have known less about keeping house</i>

688
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:28,429
<i>than I and my pretty wife did, for the
same thing happened again and again.</i>

689
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,896
- Don't!
- Why not?

690
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:33,662
- She looks so tired, poor thing.
- Tired? She's drunk!

691
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,898
But she has so many children,
who are a great trial to her.

692
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,609
- Would you carve, Mr Micawber?
- No, no, no.

693
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:52,887
<i>My pride at hosting
our first dinner together knew no limits,</i>

694
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:57,255
<i>but alas, the outcome was not
the triumph I had anticipated.</i>

695
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,430
Mutton should always be rare.

696
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,134
Perhaps we should start
with the oysters.

697
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:16,678
I'm afraid there's something the matter
with them. They don't seem right.

698
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,874
There's nothing wrong.

699
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,316
Capital oysters, in fact.
Only, they have never been opened.

700
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:30,420
All that is required
for a delightful repast is an oyster knife.

701
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,925
(MICAWBER) No? No matter.

702
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:42,230
How does Micawber
seem to you, Mr Copperfield?

703
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:44,306
A little subdued, perhaps.

704
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:48,437
He is entirely reserved.
He is secret.

705
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,910
He has become severe
to his children

706
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,209
and even looks with an eye of coldness
on the unoffending little stranger

707
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,342
recently added to our familial circle.

708
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,612
It's hard to bear.

709
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,988
Mr Micawber is not the same
since he fell in with Uriah Heep!

<i>(BETSEY) You must have
patience with her, Trot.</i>

716

Just a few words here and there.

717
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,674
Teach her
a little firmness, you mean?

718
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,707
Don't ask me such a thing, Trot.

719
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,712
The outcome would only be failure,

720
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,283
misery for Dora,

<i>but the happiness I had once
anticipated for myself eluded me,</i>

<i>and there was always
something wanting.</i>

<i>I had no equal partner

<i>Yet my decision
to adapt myself to Dora</i>

<i>made our second year
much happier than our first,</i>

might yet be complete.</i>

<i>But already, dark clouds
had begun to gather around us.</i>

You may go up now. She's resting.

732
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,258
She might still have a child one day?

Your wife is very weak,

When I can run about again,
I shall make Jip race with me.

Oh, poor Jip!

How strange that he should be old.
Even little Jip.

740
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:44,321
Let Jip have his rest.
I'll give you another dog to race with.

Oh, I couldn't have any other dog.

You are not so old, Jip, are you,
that you'll leave your mistress yet?

We may still keep each other
company a little longer.

If she were ever to leave him, London
is where she'd come to lose herself.

751
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,032
These are the places

If you need me, sir,
send word here.

755
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:49,121
Many a time in me sleep,
I heard her cry out, "Uncle!"

756

And fall like death before me.

757

Many a time I raised her up
and whispered to her,

758
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:02,799
"Emily, my dear.
I am come for to bring forgiveness,

759
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:05,065
"and to take you home."

760
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,839
I sent for you because there is news.

761
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:17,418
She has run away.
Tell him what you know.

762
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:21,581
Mr Steerforth and myself have been
abroad with the young woman

763
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:25,285
ever since she left Yarmouth
under his protection.

764
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,588
She was much admired
wherever we went.

765
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:32,631
The whole thing lasted longer
than anyone might have expected,

766
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,966
but, at last, Mr Steerforth grew restless

767
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:40,371
and charged me with breaking the news
to the young woman that he was gone.

768
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,680
Mr Steerforth proposed
that the young woman should marry

769
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:49,910
a very respectable person who was
fully prepared to overlook the past.

770
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,385
- You!
- Her conduct was surprisingly bad.

771
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,158
- She showed no gratitude at all
- Get him out of here.

772
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:01,195
This low girl he picked
out of the tide mud may be dead.

773
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:05,529
If not, it is in both our interests
that she be found.

774
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,465
She must not be allowed
to prey on him again.

775
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,367
You wrong her most grievously.

776
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,201
Is he informed of everything, Rosa?

777
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:17,243
Then there is nothing else
to detain you here, Mr Copperfield.

some reputation as a writer now.

I find my name
connected with a little praise.

780
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:30,721
It is a pity you have no mother.
She would have been proud of you.

781
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:43,370
Do you mind if I say
something very, very silly?

01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:47,341

783
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,837

Go to the inn in Buckingham Street
and ask for a Mr Peggotty.

Which, in truth, Heep took out himself
with a forged signature.

01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,974
Ever since, he has
used this supposed criminal act

No, my son will be 'umble,

01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,175
Where is my property?

899
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:09,114
Blame Mr Wickfield
for mishandling it, would you?

900

Your money is quite safe, Aunt.

902

I only took her money
to ruin you, Copperfield.

903
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:27,667
I have always hated you.

904
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,070
You've always been against me
and my love for Agnes.

905

Love?

906
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,839

01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,487
I shall return post-haste
with the forces of the law.

911
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:56,664
- Shall I go now?
- Post-haste, Mr Dick.

912
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,463
Running is futile.

913
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,937
You have nowhere to go.

914
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,011
I shall send for my family immediately.

915
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,847
The veil that has long been interposed
between Mrs Micawber and myself

916
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:21,046
is now withdrawn.

917
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,384
And my children
and the author of their being

918
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,528
can once more meet on equal terms.

919
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:34,625
Mr Micawber. It seems
you are in need of a fresh start.

920
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,065
Indeed, madam.

921
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,741
I wonder if you have ever

922
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:44,536
turned your mind to emigration?

923
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,771
It was the dream of my youth.

924
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,539
Why not go now?

925
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:52,743
Capital, madam, or rather
the lack of it, is the issue.

926
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:56,322
You have done us a great service.

927
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:59,288
What if we were to find you
the capital in return?

928
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,857
I could not take it as a gift.

929
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:11,262
But if a sufficient sum could be
advanced at five per cent per annum...

930
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,067
It shall be done in any way you wish.

931
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,644
One question arises.

932
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,483
Are the circumstance of the country such
that a man of Micawber's abilities

933
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:25,279
would have a fair chance
of rising in the social scale?

934
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:29,549
I will not say, "Might he aspire
to be Governor?" at present...

935
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:34,025
- There is no better opening anywhere.
- No better.

936
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,425
No better.

937
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:41,068
Then it is evident that Australia
is the legitimate sphere of action for him!

938
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,111
<i>Passage was booked
for the Micawbers</i>

939
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,011
<i>and suddenly it was time
to say farewell</i>

940
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,444
(DAVID) Mr Micawber?

941
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,611
You look very well equipped,
Mr Micawber.

942
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:05,159
We have abandoned the luxuries
of the old country, Copperfield.

943
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,353
Forest dwellers such as ourselves

944
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:11,863
cannot expect to participate in
the refinements of the land of the free.

945
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:15,435
I am sure there are towns
of some description in Australia,

946
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,869
but I feel it wise to be prepared.

947
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,974
- Wilkins Micawber?
- Yes.

948
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,904
I have a warrant for your arrest

949
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:25,773
on a matter of non-payment
of certain outstanding bills.

950
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:28,575
All hope is extinguished!

951
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,581
Convey my family to the workhouse

952
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:33,448
and forget that a being
such as I ever lived.

953
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:38,253
- We shall never leave without you!
- What is the value of the bills?

954
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:40,688
Nine pounds,
nineteen shillings and sixpence.

955
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,863
Ha! A mere trifle.

956
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:59,210
(MICAWBER) A noble gesture, ma'am,
that will be repaid, with interest.

957
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,210
Thank you, ma'am.

958
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:07,346
Copperfield. The time has come
for us to take our leave.

959
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:11,687
- There will be no speeches on my part.
- I don't believe a word of it.

960
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:15,557
I say, there will be
no speeches from me.

961
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,564
Only, in short...

962
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,998
...farewell, old friend.

963
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,104
God go with you, Mr Micawber.

964
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,369
God go with all of you.

965
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,278
(MICAWBER) Come on, we must board.

966
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,818
(MR DICK) Bye!

967
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:42,887
- Bye.
- Bye.

968
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,252
Bye. Bye.

969
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,485
Bye-bye!

970
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:50,190
Thank you!

971
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:56,731
<i>Mr Micawber and his family
were not alone on their journey that day.</i>

972
01:17:56,872 --> 01:18:00,740
<i>The time had also come
to say goodbye to other old friends.</i>

973
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:05,245
<i>Fearful for Emily's health, Peggotty
insisted that the news of Ham's death</i>

974
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:08,815
<i>should be kept from her
until she was stronger.</i>

975
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,779
We'll start a new life together.

976
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,044
It is so good to see you well again.

977
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:18,891
When you gave Ham my letter,
did he say anything?

978
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,061
His love is with you always.

979
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:25,058
And forgiveness?
Did he send forgiveness?

980
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,200
With all his heart.

981
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,838
I did ask this one to come with us,

982
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,702
but you see, she's that fond of you
and your, Master Davy,

983
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,809
that it wouldn't be
hardly fair to let her go.

984
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:39,175
I told him straight out,
"My place is here now, Davy."

985
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:41,373
(STEWARD) Passengers on board!

986
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,884
(WAILING)

987
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:58,465
Will I ever see my little boy again?

988
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:07,103
Be 'umble, Ury, as you always was!

989
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,881
I was dreaming a moment ago.

990
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:56,518
I thought we were in the park again.

991
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:00,588
Walking together arm in arm.

992
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,965
It was so pleasant.

993
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,936
I am quite sad to wake up.

994
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:14,740
Don't be sad. We'll go there again soon.

995
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,341
Doady, dear.

996
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:26,446
I am afraid
I was too young to be married.

997
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:28,818
Don't say such things.

998
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:33,551
I was such a silly little creature.

999
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,864
I think it might have been better

1000
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:45,269
if we had only loved each other
as boy and girl, and then forgotten it.

1001
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:50,768
I don't think I was fit to be a wife.

1002
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:54,712
- As fit as I to be a husband.
- Perhaps.

1003
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,578
But you are clever...

1004
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:04,385
...and I never was, and never could be.

1005
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:07,658
We have been happy, Dora.

1006
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:10,228
Very happy.

1007
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:16,797
But as the years went on,
you would have wearied of your little wife.

1008
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,367
I would have tried,
and disappointed you.

1009
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:27,412
And you might not have been
able to love me half so well as now.

1010
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:32,646
Do not speak to me so.
Every word seems a reproach.

1011
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:35,881
I love you too much
for reproachful words.

1012
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:42,993
It's the only merit I have,
except being pretty.

1013
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,625
Oh, how my poor boy cries.

1014
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:56,309
Will you ask Agnes
to come up, Doady?

1015
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:02,374
I want to speak to her quite alone.

1016
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:20,032
Don't cry, Doady.
It is better as it is.

1017
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:46,050
Not tonight, Jip. Not tonight.

1018
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:46,944
<i>I went as far away as I could,
not knowing, even then,</i>

1019
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:50,751
<i>how great the shock was
that I had to bear.</i>

1020
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:54,326
<i>A long and gloomy night
gathered about me,</i>

1021
01:23:54,529 --> 01:24:00,627
<i>haunted by the ghosts of many hopes,
many errors, many sorrows and regrets.</i>

1022
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,864
<i>Agnes wrote to me often.</i>

1023
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,999
<i>She gave me no advice,
she urged no duty on me.</i>

1024
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:12,204
<i>She only told me
what her trust in me was,</i>

1025
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:16,977
<i>how a nature such as mine
would turn affliction to good.</i>

1026
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:26,458
<i>But I mourned for Dora, taken so
young from the world she loved.</i>

1027
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:31,258
<i>For Steerforth, who might have won
the love and admiration of thousands</i>

1028
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:34,197
<i>as all those years ago
he had won mine.</i>

1029
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:40,001
<i>And for broken- hearted Ham, who
found peace at last in the stormy sea.</i>

1030
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:50,608
<i>I worked early and late, patiently and
hard, until my first book was finished.</i>

1031
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:55,951
<i>It was published and was successful
I began another immediately.</i>

1032
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,799
<i>Three years passed in this way.</i>

1033
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:11,895
<i>I might have gone on the same forever,
but one day I looked up from my work</i>

1034
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:14,974
<i>and suddenly I knew
it was time to return.</i>

1035
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:19,579
<i>It was as though I could hear
a voice calling me home.</i>

1036
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:21,647
<i>Agnes's voice.</i>

1037
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,417
Thank you, Peggotty.

1038
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,115
What will you do now, Trot?

1039
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,420
I thought I might ride over
to Canterbury tomorrow.

1040
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:38,430
- Is Mr Wickfield well.
- A better man in all respects.

1041
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:40,431
A reclaimed man.

1042
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:45,062
- And Agnes?
- As good and beautiful as always.

1043
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,275
Has she any admirers?

1044
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:51,742
Dozens.

1045
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,141
D-d-dozens.

1046
01:25:56,417 --> 01:26:01,548
- But is anyone worthy of her?
- I suspect she has an attachment.

1047
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:08,821
I think she is going to be married.

1048
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,024
<i>(AGNES) Will you go away again.?</i>

1049
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:17,900
<i>(DAVID) Perhaps. There is
little enough to hold me here.</i>

1050
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,500
You have a secret.
Let me share it.

1051
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:26,579
- A secret?
- There is someone close to your heart.

1052
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:30,013
My aunt told me. Confide in me.

1053
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:35,848
Let me be your friend and brother
in this as in so many other things.

1054
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,695
- What have I done?
- I am not myself.

1055
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:43,659
Don't speak to me now.
We'll talk later.

1056
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:45,959
If you have a burden,
let me lighten it.

1057
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:47,795
I must go.

1058
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:51,997
If you have a lover, you can tell me.

1059
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:56,042
The attachment I have is not
a new one. It is not what you suppose.

1060
01:26:56,277 --> 01:27:01,044
I cannot reveal it! It has long been mine
and must remain mine.

1061
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,445
Agnes...

1062
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:09,051
You love me?

1063
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,990
I have loved you all my life.

1064
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:19,059
- For God's sake, let me go.
- What have I ever been without you?

1065
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,531
- You mean as a sister?
- No.

1066
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:25,366
Much more than that.

1067
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:32,275
I went away loving you,
I stayed away loving you,

1068
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:36,713
and I have returned home loving you.

1069
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:03,837
Do you remember how Dora
sent for me the night that she died?

1070
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:08,512
She made me
promise something to her.

1071
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:10,548
What was it?

1072
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:17,516
She told me that only I could occupy
this empty space in your heart.

(CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER)

1074
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:48,881
Trotwood! We have a visitor.

1075
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:03,196
(DAN LAUGHS)

1076
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,670
Maybe things were a little hard at first,

1077
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,539
but what with sheep farming
and one thing and another,

1078
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:12,873
we are as well to do as well could be.

1079
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:15,447
And Emily?

1080
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:18,449
She might have married
any number of times.

1081
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:22,817
"But Uncle," she says to me,
"that's gone forever."

1082
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,356
That's my Emily.

1083
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:31,362
There's happy news of someone else
you might recall, sir.

1084
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:40,269
"Mr Wilkins Micawber,
magistrate, writer, famed public orator,

1085
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:43,944
"and manager of
the Port Middlebay Bank,

1086

this Thursday last.

1087
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:52,685
"Far be it from us to follow
our distinguished townsman

1088
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:58,884
"through the smoothly-flowing periods of
his polished and highly ornate address!"

1089
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:03,224
...and the Lord Chancellor
turned to me and said,

1090
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:08,267
"By God, Micawber, you're right.
The law must be changed."

1091
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:10,199
(LAUGHTER)

1092
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:12,806
"It was a masterpiece of eloquence,

1093
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:18,206
"and those passages in which he traced
his own brilliantly successful career,

1094
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,372
"with particular emphasis
on the importance

1095

"of avoiding
pecuniary liabilities at all costs,

1096
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:29,514
"brought a tear
to the manliest eye present."

1097
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:36,196
I would like to introduce you to
the greatest person I have ever known.

1098
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:38,832
My lovely wife, Emma.

<i>And so my story
draws to its close.</i>

1102
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:58,775
There was a night much like this
many years ago, Trot.

1103
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,118
<i>Except perhaps for one more item
that demands to be recorded.</i>

1104

<i>Our first two children had been boys.</i>

1105

It's a girl
