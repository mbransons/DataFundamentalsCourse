1
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,000
Riggs, you sure we're on
the right street?

2
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,800
We must be getting warm.

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,440
- You see anything?
- Where? I don't see anything.

4
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,920
This must be the place.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,400
Holy shit!

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,120
What the hell is that?

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,080
Jesus!

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Who's this joker?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,800
I don't know.
A spokesman for the NRA.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Regular asshole.

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,200
What do we do now?

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,080
Run him over.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,680
What if he shoots us with that rifle?

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,760
- He hasn't yet. Maybe he won't.
- What if he does?

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,880
Don't be a Don't-Bee.
Be a Do-Bee. Be positive.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,960
Positive?

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,360
- Run him over.
- Glad you see things my way.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,800
I hope he doesn't turn.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,040
He won't. We'll creep up on him
so he won't notice.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,800
Will him not to turn.
Power of positive thinking.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,600
Don't turn.
Will him with me.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,520
Don't turn around.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,880
I need you.
Don't turn around!

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,760
Just believe!

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,880
Don't turn around!

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,040
We're better than him.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,240
We're better!

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
He's turning.

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,320
They just bounce off him!

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,920
I saw! We're in trouble!

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,080
Shit! I'll draw his fire.
You run for cover.

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,800
No, I'll draw his fire.
You run for cover.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,480
Are you crazy?! You got
a wife, kids. I got less to lose!

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,480
Get out of here!

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm not supposed to tell you,
but Lorna's pregnant.

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,920
What'd you say?

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,520
You'll be a father!

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,240
She was afraid to tell you.
She was afraid you'd get angry.

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
You never talked about children?

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,960
- Shit!
- A baby.

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,200
There's something I'm not
supposed to tell you too.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,720
Rianne's pregnant. You're going
to be a grandfather.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Rianne's what?!

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,720
Rianne can't be pregnant.

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,800
She's not married.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
I don't think she intended
to get that way.

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,280
They asking me to be a granddaddy?

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,040
Here's what we'll do.
Take your clothes off!

49
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
What for?

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,400
Okay, you run.

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,720
Flame-O sees you in your undies.

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,840
It distracts him,
then I shoot.

53
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
- Shoot what?
- The valve on that napalm tank!

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,880
Before he shoots me?

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
- Maybe.
- Maybe?!

56
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Is he black?

57
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,720
Too much armor on.
I can't tell!

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,800
No! Not him!
The father of the baby!

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,040
Please let him be black!

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,800
Get going! Here he comes!

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,080
Are those hearts?

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,520
Not now, Riggs.
Just hit the damn valve!

63
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,040
Also, flap and make noises
like a bird.

64
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,960
Flap my arms? Why?

65
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,360
Lt'll distract him more.
I need him to turn.

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,880
- On 2!
- We always go on 3.

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
No time for 3. 2!

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,880
- What about 1?
- Okay. 1, 2, go!

69
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
I don't want to die in my underwear!

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
Why are you waiting?
Shoot the bastard!

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,080
Riggs, you think
that bird thing helped?

72
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,080
I just wanted to see if you'd do it.

73
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,000
Cute shorts.

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
Go spit!

75
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,920
I'll buy you a doughnut.

76
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,360
Don't hug me when I'm naked.

77
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
You're ashamed of your butt?

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
He's a lively one.

79
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
That shark hurts my boat,
I take it out on you, Leo.

80
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,120
- I didn't mean to catch it.
- Why do you want to keep it?

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,120
Yeah, why keep a shark?

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,040
The teeth'll look great on a wall.

83
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,600
They got to stop snapping first.

84
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,360
Maybe he'll fall asleep.

85
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
Converse with him.
He'll nod off.

86
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,760
- He don't look tired.
- Chewing on Leo will wear him out.

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,200
Sharks eat their own kind?

88
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,800
Stop it!
I'm in stitches!

89
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,240
Okay, where's my bag?

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,640
Starboard side aft.

91
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,800
Starboard, that's left, right?

92
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,800
No, port's left.
Starboard's right.

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,520
Right, yeah. Right side aft.
Got it!

94
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,800
- Whatever.
- Check both sides.

95
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,040
Careful!
He's behind you, shark!

96
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,480
Maybe we should throw him overboard.

97
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,640
Throw them both overboard.

98
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,920
No witnesses.
We'd probably get away with it.

99
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
You too?

100
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,640
I kept my nose out of it...

101
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
...but you and Lorna.

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,800
You're having a baby,
you're living together.

103
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,160
You're not marrying.

104
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Why, does that violate your
family values system?

105
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,680
I'm just trying to understand.

106
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,240
Rianne's not married either.

107
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,640
That's hitting below the belt.

108
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,800
You know, when I was married...

109
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
...it was good. You know.

110
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,000
You put the ring on.
You make the commitment.

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,600
You do all the...

112
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,440
She's dead because I'm a cop.

113
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,920
She's dead because I'm a cop
and I...

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,400
I don't wear the ring anymore...

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,200
...but I look, and it's still there.

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,000
I still feel it.

117
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,960
It's like I'm not
finished with that yet.

118
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,360
I can't explain it.
Is that bullshit?

119
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,800
No. It's not finished.

120
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,400
It's not finished.

121
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,680
Okay, you did say "aft"?

122
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,520
A-F-T. Aft!

123
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,120
That's a fucking word?

124
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,760
In the back on the right side, Leo!

125
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
Why didn't you say that
to begin with, Roger?!

126
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,680
People get around boats and water,
everything becomes nautical!

127
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,200
"Astern! Avast, you landlubbers!

128
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,480
Man the bilge pump!"

129
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,440
Pump your fucking ass!

130
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,800
All right, all right!

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,440
No problem, no problem!

132
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,320
What's Lorna say about it?

133
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,360
She doesn't like nautical terms either.

134
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
We haven't discussed it.
That's pretty messed up.

135
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,520
The baby's due in days and you
haven't talked about marrying?

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,880
No.

137
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,200
I haven't done it at all.

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,040
Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?

139
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,480
I want Leo to shoot...

140
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,520
No, Leo!

141
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,000
What?!

142
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
- What's the deal?!
- You're shooting a gun on my boat!

143
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,560
I'm not shooting your boat,
I'm shooting Jaws.

144
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,480
Nobody's killing it
just to have its teeth!

145
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,800
You're grumpy since you
learned you'll be a grandpa.

146
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,400
Get off of me, will you?

147
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
Don't fool around!

148
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,640
Some piece of hardware!
Got a permit?

149
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,800
Of course!
I'm a P.I. Now.

150
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,200
A gumshoe! You get in
ugly situations. I got guns!

151
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,240
You are an ugly situation.

152
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,440
You don't deserve this.
You're not safe.

153
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,880
Smart move, Riggs.

154
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
Shit!

155
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,080
Hard right!

156
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,320
You hear shots?

157
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Coast Guard, this is <i>Code 7.</i>

158
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,680
We're in L.A. Harbor.

159
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,400
We got an 07.

160
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,080
They're getting away!

161
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,200
Who was it? Do we know?

162
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,280
No, no, I'll drive!

163
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,640
- Want me to help?
- Get out of here!

164
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,080
This your gun?

165
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,840
Yeah, want laser surgery?

166
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
You could blind somebody!

167
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,760
Coast Guard, this is <i>Code 7,</i>
<i>in pursuit of freighter.</i>

168
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Heading north.

169
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,080
Awaiting instructions. Over.

170
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,920
<i>Code 7,</i>
<i>maintain your present course.</i>

171
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,840
<i>We have a cutter en route.</i>

172
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,760
Why you slowing down?

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,960
We'll hang here.
Coast Guard'll be here soon.

174
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,440
- What do we do now?
- Show them our badges.

175
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
LAPD!

176
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,000
LAPD!

177
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,960
Los Angeles Police Department!

178
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,080
We heard gunfire!
The Coast Guard's on the...

179
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Coast Guard!
Freighter's on fire!

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,840
- Let's board them.
- What are you talking about?!

181
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,000
Fire on the freighter!

182
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,640
Okay, I'm upside.
Now what do you do?

183
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,720
They're getting away.
Get me up there!

184
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,880
Hell of a fishing trip!

185
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Shut up and keep your head down!

186
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
LAPD!

187
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,280
Stop where you are!
Hold it right there!

188
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,040
He's got it! He's got it!

189
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
What'd he say?

190
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,720
Watch his back!

191
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,960
You didn't say you'd shoot!

192
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,200
Tie it up!

193
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
Pull it up!

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Great!

195
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,840
I said keep the boat closer!

196
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,880
Why listen to Leo?

197
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,880
Shit!

198
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,920
You all right, Riggs?!

199
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Look!

200
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,240
Shit!

201
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
Jump! Jump!

202
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,400
Where are you?

203
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,480
My boat! My new boat!

204
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,080
- The shark.
- What about the shark?

205
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,600
Shark!

206
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
Don't leave me!

207
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Come on!

208
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,320
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

209
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,520
You'll make it!

210
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,720
This is all I got left.

211
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,040
Four sets of papers, totally genuine.

212
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,080
They'll get in the country
and can stay forever.

213
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,040
U.S. Citizens.

214
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,200
Ask them to vote the incumbent party.

215
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,960
Help me keep my State Department job.

216
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
Bloody marvelous!

217
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,360
They red-flag Asian visas.
Those were hard to slip through.

218
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,160
The ship's been impounded.

219
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,280
What about the family?

220
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,480
We don't know yet.

221
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,240
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

222
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,960
Something wrong?

223
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,840
A small delivery problem, Mr. Proody.

224
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
Goodbye.

225
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
Leave!

226
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,560
I'll find them.

227
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,160
Now.

228
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,640
Coast Guard interdicts
about one a month.

229
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,080
Pretty raggedy-looking.

230
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,880
Six weeks locked in a hole
with one toilet.

231
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,440
Rice and some fish to eat.
Lousy deal for 35 grand a head.

232
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,960
Where'd they get that kind of money?

233
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,160
Didn't. Got to work it off from
the snakeheads, the smugglers.

234
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,920
- They sell them as cheap labor.
- Sell them?

235
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,920
Like slaves.

236
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,440
These must be the lucky ones.

237
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,520
They'll claim asylum. Say they were
persecuted, like everybody else.

238
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,240
We'll send them packing.
Cost you and me a fortune.

239
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,800
What happened to,
"Bring me your tired, your poor...

240
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,440
...your wretched masses,
yearning to be free"?

241
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,720
Now it reads, "No vacancies."

242
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,400
I guess your parents
were Native Americans.

243
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,840
They pop one every boatload.

244
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,040
Shows the rest what'll happen
if they run off.

245
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,840
He's nobody's slave now.

246
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,200
Don't coddle them, move them!

247
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,760
I see this barrel coming down.

248
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,320
Murtaugh didn't see it,
so I push him.

249
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,240
I knock him over.
We're in the water.

250
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,040
I pull because he can't swim.
I got to save him.

251
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,840
There's that kid.
What's his name? Bissel?

252
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,360
- It's a food.
- Burger!

253
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,080
No, Biscuits or something.

254
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,000
He always kisses my ass,
gives me coffee and shit.

255
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,360
Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh.
What are you doing here?

256
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,200
- That's a long story.
- You're all wet!

257
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,080
- You need a blanket?
- I'm fine.

258
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,880
- Somebody get this man a blanket now!
- Yes, sir!

259
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,720
- Get this body out of here.
- What do we got here?

260
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
Step back, step back.

261
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,680
Shit!

262
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,120
He's dead.
He's fucking dead!

263
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,640
- Shit!
- What?

264
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,360
This is how he wanted
to come to America?

265
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,200
Was he in the killing section?

266
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
This guy's been shot four times!

267
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,000
At close range, like he was executed!

268
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,360
He was executed.

269
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,360
By the crew.

270
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,120
People get killed left, right
and center in this town!

271
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Now we import victims?

272
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,480
Gangbangers kill each other,
no problem!

273
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,080
One of us gets shot,
occupational hazard!

274
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,480
But just a normal guy?
What did he ever do to anybody?!

275
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
- That ain't right.
- Easy, Biscuits.

276
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,720
You'll get an ulcer.
Settle down.

277
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,880
Blanket!

278
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,680
Sorry, Blankets.

279
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,160
Sorry, I'm losing my head.

280
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,320
I hate to see bad things
happen to good folk.

281
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,560
We'd stick around, Butler,
but you're in charge so...

282
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,680
You should take this, it's free.
You're all wet.

283
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,040
- Get some vapor rub on your chest.
- All right, Boogers.

284
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,560
Hey, get them out of here!

285
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,840
Get them out of here!

286
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,240
He takes the job kind of personally.

287
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,880
Yeah, he's pretty serious, I'd say.
Overzealous.

288
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,480
Jealous of who?

289
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,400
- I don't know. Who?
- You said he was jealous.

290
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,840
You just said...

291
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
I said he was zealous.
Full of zeal.

292
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,160
He's loud too.

293
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,960
- He's loud!
- What?

294
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,200
We better get up
before the sun's up.

295
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,800
I got something in the lifeboat.

296
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,800
That's okay,
I'll catch a squad ride.

297
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,320
I'm sorry about your boat.

298
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,600
- I'm sorry.
- Shit!

299
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,480
Suddenly, a big fucking shark comes...
Can I say that?

300
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,920
You can say it, but we can't air it.

301
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,800
So this big darn shark comes along...

302
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,080
My <i>Code 7.</i>

303
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
- You were coming home last night.
- I'm sorry.

304
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,080
I had some bad Chinese.

305
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
You look a little banged up.

306
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,760
You look a little knocked up.

307
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,440
Are you okay?

308
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,880
You sure?

309
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,600
Easy, tiger!
There he goes again.

310
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,440
There she goes again.

311
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,680
You okay?

312
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,520
I'm better than Roger.
His boat sank.

313
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,800
- Boat sank?
- I had something to do with it.

314
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,360
No! No grease!

315
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,600
- Have some cookies.
- What happened?

316
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,280
Gunfights, explosions, sharks.
The usual.

317
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,600
Here, boy.

318
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
Thanks.

319
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,480
You were fishing.
Does trouble go looking for you?

320
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,640
It seems to know pretty much
where I am most of the time.

321
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,280
You finished the nursery.

322
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,600
Yeah, I did.

323
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,560
It's good for a girl or boy.
Cute, huh?

324
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,200
It's a dogfest!
Did you get the whole 101?

325
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,200
I know. I got a little
carried away with puppies.

326
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,240
Kid'll probably hate dogs.

327
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,240
You know, Lorna, we never
ever talked about marriage.

328
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
I figured you didn't want that.

329
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,040
You want to get married?

330
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,080
Well, no.

331
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,720
Me neither.

332
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,160
Breakfast?

333
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,240
<i>Serve and Protect.</i>

334
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,240
Since when do you read this smut?

335
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,080
It's not smut, it's Ebony Clark.
Trish gave it to me.

336
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,240
"Every fiber in his being
desired her.

337
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,360
He devoured her with his eyes."

338
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,640
Can we try this thing
on page 196 sometime?

339
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,800
There's a good one on 168.
Maybe later.

340
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,160
Nothing comes between
a pregnant lady and a meal.

341
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,000
Have I ever
"made your womanhood reach peaks...

342
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,200
...to rival the Himalayas"?

343
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,880
- Foothills of Malibu, maybe.
- Not even a Teton?

344
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,480
- I don't think so.
- Thanks.

345
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,160
I thought I'd at least
rate the Rockies.

346
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,040
You know I'm kidding.

347
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,160
- You say that to make me feel better.
- No, I don't.

348
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,280
You know I'm playing.

349
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,040
I've been to plenty of
mountaintops with you.

350
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,360
It's just that I'm hungry.

351
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,600
When you have that kid,
we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens.

352
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,120
- I brought you a doughnut.
- Police food!

353
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,520
How did you know?

354
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,800
I dropped by Internal Affairs yesterday.

355
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,280
How's the rat squad?

356
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,240
- I picked up something good.
- Some cheese?

357
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,040
I.A. Got an anonymous tip.

358
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,440
The person said Roger's on the take.

359
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,760
No, he's not.

360
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,120
I know! It's probably
some jerk he put away.

361
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,400
But with new boats
and putting 2 kids through college...

362
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,440
...I thought you ought to know.

363
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,440
I actually tried to
persuade him to take money.

364
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,840
Stop it, Riggs!
I can't hear that! Nothing!

365
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,240
I won't say anything anymore.
I'm kidding.

366
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,160
- That's awful.
- I'm kidding.

367
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,960
Don't tell him I said it.
With his problems...

368
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,520
...he'll blow his top.
Just don't say anything.

369
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,640
What do you mean?

370
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,320
Like what?

371
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,920
- In general, problems.
- You mean something specific.

372
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,080
I got a nose for these things. What?

373
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,600
You're pushing me.
I don't want you to go there.

374
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,880
Get it off your chest.
You'll feel better.

375
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,400
I won't leave you alone
till you tell me.

376
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Tell me.

377
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,360
I'll tell you!
Pregnancy destroyed my brain cells!

378
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,880
What? What?

379
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,760
I'm drooling. What?

380
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,400
Promise me you'll never
say a word about this ever.

381
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,240
- I swear, I swear.
- Right hand!

382
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,880
I swear I won't, ever.

383
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,520
I promise. What?

384
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,360
You know how Roger is
about his daughter dating cops.

385
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,920
He'd kill them. So?

386
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,240
Rianne married one, her baby's father.
She's afraid to tell Roger.

387
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,760
They met, fell in love.
She got pregnant, they got hitched.

388
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,840
Nobody's telling Roger?

389
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,320
After the baby's born.

390
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,680
It's a package deal?
Take it or leave it?

391
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,040
- Does Trish know?
- She knows.

392
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,800
She doesn't know you know.
But Trish knows.

393
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,480
Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead
son-in-law?

394
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
- Who?
- Sergeant Lee Butters.

395
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,920
This just gets better!
No wonder he sucks up to Rog.

396
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,960
Brings him apples,
blankets, coffee...

397
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,840
Not a word.
I'm telling you, nothing!

398
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,000
I won't tell. He'd shoot me
just for being the messenger.

399
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,480
He's my best friend. It'd be wrong
to mess with him. I won't.

400
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,000
Promise.

401
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,440
We don't have to discuss boys' names.
We're having a girl.

402
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,440
Okay. Piadora.

403
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,160
I like Piadora. That's sweet.

404
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,640
I love that name.

405
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,440
We're talking kids' names.
Has Rianne picked any out?

406
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,920
We don't want to double up.

407
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,440
Oscar for the boy,
Loreen if it's a girl.

408
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,440
I like Lee Butter.
Better! I like it better.

409
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,800
- Don't get me started.
- I like those names.

410
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,640
Captain wants to see us.

411
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,520
Trish'll be right down.
Have fun shopping for the baby.

412
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,840
Bye-bye, honey.

413
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,200
Who had the sleepover?

414
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
Just airing out camping gear.

415
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,640
- We're out of here.
- Something smells good.

416
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Really good!

417
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,680
Trish has food on the stove.
We're out of here.

418
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,800
That smells like Chinese food.

419
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,800
Chinese food?

420
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,800
She's into Chinese cooking.

421
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
I got to taste this.

422
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,000
- I love Chinese food.
- Hold it! Please!

423
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
Please!

424
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,200
There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.

425
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,400
I saw him.

426
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,240
A couple of Chinese people.

427
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,240
Actually a whole family.

428
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,520
Large family.

429
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,360
Hey, guys!

430
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,120
- It does smell good.
- Great!

431
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,160
They hid in the lifeboat.

432
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,560
I had to do something.

433
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,800
- So you brought them home.
- It took two trips.

434
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,480
- Really?
- They fit in the station wagon?

435
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.

436
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,120
He's head of the family.
Speaks English.

437
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,800
Hong, this is my partner,
Martin Riggs, and Lorna.

438
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,320
Wife?

439
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,520
Can we speak?

440
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,040
Lorna, this is the best breakfast.

441
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm hungry. I'd love some.

442
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,600
This is illegal.
As in, "against the law."

443
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,480
You'll bring a shitstorm
down on you.

444
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,400
Just hold on!
Just wait a frigging minute!

445
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,440
The way I see it,
those are slave ships out there.

446
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,600
And I'm freeing slaves...

447
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,320
...like no one did for my ancestors.

448
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,880
It's my chance to do something
and do it right.

449
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
Why didn't you say so?
This won't be boring.

450
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,080
Need any help?

451
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,040
Where is he?

452
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,040
What this time,
food or money?

453
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,520
- Food and money.
- Money.

454
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,520
I see you more
than when you lived here.

455
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,600
We're independent now.

456
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,800
What's the money for?

457
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,640
- Hookers, drugs...
- Contraceptives.

458
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,480
Can you believe how
they talk to me?

459
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,720
It costs more to go to school now.

460
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,600
I get the tuition bills.
And the grades too!

461
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,520
This is a down payment
on a future ass-chewing.

462
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,080
Get out and go to school.

463
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,200
I see the tuition.

464
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,840
I want to see some grades!
I want more cluck for my buck.

465
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,480
Thanks for the money.

466
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm tired.

467
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,120
Me, I can't win.

468
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Boy!

469
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,360
Did we get a raise
and nobody told me?

470
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,600
I got to get to the bank.

471
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,440
How can you when you're taken
to the cleaners all the time?

472
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,000
Hey, guys.

473
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,680
Hey, Trish!

474
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,680
- Both the kids leave?
- Yes. And we're broke.

475
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Is Lorna here?

476
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,800
She's in the kitchen,
on her third breakfast.

477
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,840
I remember those days.

478
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,480
- I'm sorry!
- I love it when you do that.

479
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,640
You look terrific.

480
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,400
Wait till she tries raising
that baby by herself.

481
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,720
I'll be fine.

482
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,480
Move back in and Grandpa'll
be up nights with the baby.

483
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Better than her
marrying the wrong guy.

484
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,480
A cop or something.

485
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
True.

486
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,080
Come on, guys.
See you.

487
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,080
I should say goodbye.

488
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,640
Hurry up!

489
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,680
Stuffing your face!

490
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,320
Stop kissing me.
Try that.

491
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
Stay away from my girl.

492
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm not joking.
Stay away from my girl.

493
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,440
- Joking!
- Got the baby beeper?

494
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
- I know.
- It's your fault.

495
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,600
It's your fault.
All the chicken shit.

496
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,760
Flapping all over the place.

497
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,000
All right, everybody!

498
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,080
It's been a year almost.
This shit ain't funny no more!

499
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,360
- Enough is enough!
- Please! Enough!

500
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
I'm the one that gets it in the neck.

501
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,320
Can we exercise maturity?

502
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,960
If I find who's doing this,
I'll kick his ass.

503
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,360
I catch that asshole who
put my picture up, that's it!

504
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,640
- Cut their balls off.
- Captain.

505
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,080
I look out expecting
to see all the old faces.

506
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,520
Instead, I see kids
whose names I barely remember.

507
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,680
Will you sit down?
We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.

508
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Speak for yourself.

509
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,040
We're making way for the new police:

510
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,720
Guys with guns and psychology degrees,
like Butters out there.

511
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,000
Biter has a psychology degree?

512
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,840
- More like a psycho degree.
- Times have got to change.

513
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,760
I once got shot by a hot-rodder
with a zip gun.

514
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,560
That's how far back I go.

515
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,600
You wanted to see us?

516
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,400
Some things don't change.

517
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,360
- Here we go.
- The department lost its insurance.

518
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,320
All the damage you've done,
they can't get a new one...

519
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,920
...while you two still run around.

520
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,400
They can't fire you either.

521
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,360
So, they're promoting you.

522
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,480
- Lieutenant!
- There's no open lieutenant spots.

523
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,400
So the chief used his special privilege,
making you captains.

524
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,440
- Better.
- Captain!

525
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,480
Time was when this would send me over
the falls. I'm getting old.

526
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
What do we do now?

527
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,680
Captain shit!

528
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,120
- Hang out.
- Take long lunches.

529
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,480
Yell, "Riggs, Murtaugh,
I'm the captain."

530
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,200
"Chief's shitting bricks!"

531
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,240
You finished?

532
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,600
Can you stay out of trouble?

533
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,080
Absolutely.

534
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,720
- Captain Riggs!
- Captain Murtaugh!

535
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,200
You want your badges?
Let me see those sergeant badges.

536
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,560
Throw them over here.

537
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,000
This is the most painful
experience of my life.

538
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,800
- Now get out!
- Thank you, Captain.

539
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,120
Thank you, Captain.

540
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,280
Enough with the "Captain" shit!
Get out of here!

541
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,280
After you, Captain, I insist!
"O Captain! My Captain!"

542
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,840
- Captains outrageous!
- News travels fast.

543
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Get a break from real police work.
Play golf, tennis...

544
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,280
<i>They got brown rings</i>
<i>Around their noses</i>

545
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,120
Now that you're captains,
come up in the chopper.

546
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
- Not for me.
- I'll take a rain check.

547
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,440
- Lf you change your mind, call us.
- He's down-to-earth.

548
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm sorry.

549
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,920
Can we knock this off?
This is your captain speaking.

550
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,040
The man's got feelings, you know?

551
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,720
Congratulations.
Look at you!

552
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,560
Captain Murtaugh.

553
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,720
I don't know how to say this,
but you really inspire me.

554
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,720
Keep it up.

555
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,200
How's it going, Burton?

556
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,000
- It's Butters, Captain.
- I'll remember that.

557
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,880
- Kid really likes you.
- I wish he'd cut it out.

558
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,600
He likes me?

559
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,880
Likes me?

560
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,240
You don't think he likes me...

561
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,640
...likes me like that?

562
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,480
It's the police,
not the military.

563
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,720
The millennium's upon us.

564
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,440
The captain said:
"New people, new department."

565
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
Dr. Woods?

566
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,400
Captain Riggs.

567
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,280
- Don't run.
- I'm in a rush.

568
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,760
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it this time?

569
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,200
Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?

570
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,880
- Or did you cook up something new?
- I'm sorry about all that.

571
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
I want your advice.
I was thinking of...

572
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
- Thinking?
- Marriage.

573
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,880
Marriage?! The "M" word?

574
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,640
Does "confidentiality" mean anything?

575
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,080
That's funny.

576
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,960
You know what'd happen?
We'd go in my office...

577
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
...and you know what you'd tell me?

578
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,400
You'd tell me something like, "Doc...

579
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,680
...I want to marry Murtaugh."

580
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,400
Or your mother.
Or Nelson Mandela!

581
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,800
Nelson Mandela?!

582
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,480
Something to ridicule me, Riggs.

583
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,160
Something to get a rise out of me.

584
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,800
Listen carefully!

585
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,240
I'm... not... stupid!

586
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
And my time is reserved...

587
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,240
...for police officers with
real needs and real problems.

588
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,880
Have you got that?!

589
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,440
- Have you?!
- Ask me again?

590
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,440
No. And you know what?

591
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,360
I don't like you.

592
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,680
Stephanie?

593
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,160
I can't go out with you.
I'm in a relationship.

594
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,600
I think you need to see someone.

595
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,080
You'll find someone to love you.

596
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,040
Not in this department.
But stop bothering me!

597
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,360
You're disgusting!

598
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,120
What's the matter with you people?!

599
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,440
What's shaking?

600
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,560
- Captain Riggs.
- Captain Murtaugh.

601
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,240
Turn around and do that.
We're captains.

602
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
Heard you were up to your ass
in Chinese.

603
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,760
The taller ones come up to the navel.

604
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,120
Big enough to kick your ass.
What can I do for you?

605
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,720
One of the ship's crew shot an illegal,
apparently under orders...

606
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,640
...and we'd dearly like to know
who's smuggling Chinese.

607
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,480
We're pretty sure the big boss
is Benny Chan.

608
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Uncle Benny?

609
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,440
You know him?

610
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,560
- When he was running smack.
- We never nailed him.

611
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,920
Benny's slippery.

612
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,720
Where's he hang out?

613
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,040
He's got a nightclub,
some restaurants.

614
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,520
He operates mainly out on North
Broadway. Here's the address.

615
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,480
Hi, fellas.

616
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,680
There he is.
Hey, Burger! Summers.

617
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,960
Butters.

618
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,200
What you got on the freighter homicide?

619
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,240
I talked to some illegals.
They only knew the shooter by sight.

620
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,400
The boat's registered under
a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.

621
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,400
It'll be a rough one to crack,
but we'll nail them.

622
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,160
You ever hear of Benny Chan?

623
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,600
No. What kind of bad man is he?

624
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,800
Real bad.
Crime boss in Chinatown.

625
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,640
If it's dirty and Chinese,
Benny's doing it.

626
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,560
Where do I find him?

627
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,840
At this restaurant.

628
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,400
I'm hungry for Chinese.
How about you?

629
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,320
We're going there anyway.
We'll drive you.

630
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,960
Let me get my jacket.

631
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,920
- Not with him.
- He's doing good.

632
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,640
We might need backup.

633
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,840
Spend time with him.
You might learn to love him.

634
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,480
Like a son.

635
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
In law...

636
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,560
...enforcement it pays to know
your fellow officer.

637
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,560
Sir, it'll be an honor
to share egg rolls with you.

638
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,440
Yeah, all right. Let's go.

639
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,000
Share?

640
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,400
Butters, it seems like you hate crime
in a sort of personal way.

641
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,200
Why do you say that, sir?

642
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,840
Last night I noticed you were
more than slightly miffed.

643
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,800
Wasn't he, Roger?

644
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,760
Any particular reason?

645
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,320
About 150,000 of them.

646
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,640
That's how many bullets zinged
my neighborhood growing up.

647
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,720
Couldn't go outside.
Couldn't go near a window.

648
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Lived and ate on the floor,
slept and watched TV on the floor.

649
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,600
I didn't learn to walk
till I was 10.

650
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,400
Spent my formative years
nose-to-nose with the family beagle.

651
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,360
When I work on a crime,
I ain't thinking about the crime.

652
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,760
I'm thinking about that floor
and it pisses me off.

653
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,920
- We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?
- No, why?

654
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,200
Because he's following us.
Don't look.

655
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,200
- Who's Leo?
- Maybe it's a coincidence.

656
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,720
- What does he want?
- I don't know. Let's find out.

657
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,520
- Fucking asshole!
- Bite me!

658
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,480
Whatever! Whatever!

659
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,520
Jerk!

660
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,720
You looking for us?

661
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,440
- You saw me?
- Yeah, we saw you.

662
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,880
What you doing, Leo?

663
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,160
I'm perfecting my tailing technique
now that I'm a P.I.

664
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,960
He's a private eyesore.
Inconspicuous vehicle! I like it.

665
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,360
Riggs, who's the perp?

666
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,520
- What'd you bust him for?
- I'm a perp?

667
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,680
A brother in a police car
is automatically a perp?

668
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,600
Look at my suit!
Do I look like the Crips' accountant?

669
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,840
Look at this badge, bitch!

670
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,880
Check out the gun.

671
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,400
Put the gun down!

672
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,440
License! Registration!
Urine sample!

673
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,840
I got a badge too!

674
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,440
German Jews didn't have it
easy as kids!

675
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,480
So don't think you're the only one.

676
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,360
I knew you were a cop.

677
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,000
I was kidding.
I can smell a cop a mile away.

678
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,160
You saying I smell bad?

679
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,720
Don't turn everything around!
You're so touchy.

680
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,720
These guys'll tell you.
We got a history together.

681
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,920
Maybe we'll work together someday!

682
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,320
I'm the bomb!

683
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,240
We'll work together when I open
a cereal shop, you leprechaun!

684
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,840
I didn't call you names, fuckface!
Don't start!

685
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,680
Don't fool around!

686
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,240
- These guys'll tell you.
- You're double-parked.

687
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,160
Officer, I'm just talking
with the detectives.

688
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,760
We don't know this guy.

689
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,160
Think he was drinking.

690
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,040
They're kidding.
Come back!

691
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,600
I wasn't drinking!
They just said that.

692
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,040
Blow your breath in my hand.
I can smell it already.

693
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,800
Blow in my fucking ear!

694
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,200
You're all mine.
You're mine!

695
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,840
You promised to deliver the family.

696
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,440
They're not at the detention center.

697
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,240
They must have escaped.

698
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,120
The uncle won't finish until
he sees them.

699
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,640
Don't worry, they'll turn up.

700
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,520
In Hong Kong, you'd already be dead.

701
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,480
Where's Uncle Benny?

702
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,560
- He's not here.
- Is he in there?

703
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,160
- I'm sure he is.
- This way.

704
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,760
Yes, it's a two-way.

705
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,840
We have 3 people.

706
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,160
The restaurant's over there.
Go this way, please.

707
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,320
They see us,
but we can't see them.

708
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,040
- Where's your green card?
- That's a racist remark.

709
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,840
I'm a policeman
who asked for your green card!

710
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,200
This is not the way.

711
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,640
You're the boss
till we get up in his ass.

712
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,560
It'll be fine.
They've refurbished!

713
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,760
I couldn't stop them.

714
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,560
- Out, out!
- Can I get drink or food?

715
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,120
Uncle Benny!
I hope this is a bad time.

716
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,320
- He still has unclipped eyebrows.
- What'd we tell you?

717
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,280
- We hate not disturbing you.
- This is Detective Buckles.

718
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Sell any heroin? Kill anyone lately?
How's the restaurant?

719
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,880
Eat something.

720
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,120
Give you the police discount.

721
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,200
Flied lice?

722
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,280
It is fried rice, you plick!

723
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
I'm busy.
What is it this time?

724
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,760
Tell him, Buttkiss.

725
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,360
Know about a boatload of
illegals that went aground?

726
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,680
Just what I saw on the news.

727
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,760
Someone lost big money.

728
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,480
400 people at 35 grand.
14 million!

729
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,840
And missed making them slaves.

730
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,120
You are cops.
Smuggling Chinese is an INS problem.

731
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,560
We found 3 bodies full of holes,
so now it's a cop problem.

732
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,160
Three dead Chinese?

733
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,720
- Billion more where they came from.
- Yes, life's cheap.

734
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,080
But he shot at us too.
That pisses us off.

735
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,800
Too bad they missed.

736
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,000
But I know nothing about it.

737
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,120
Who's he?

738
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,920
He looks unhappy.
What's his name?

739
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,400
Who's this guy?
Is he just appraising your furniture?

740
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,240
He doesn't speak English.

741
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,280
Then he doesn't understand
words like "scumbag"...

742
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,360
..."eat shit"?

743
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,600
I think he understands good.

744
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,840
- Enter the drag queen.
- The insurance, remember?

745
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,560
If you have nothing on me,
get out.

746
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,560
We're still around.

747
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,240
I'm on your ass too.

748
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,720
But the door is this way!

749
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,560
This is quicker.
This is quicker, really.

750
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,360
See? It's quicker!

751
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,160
Don't forget my
10°/° policeman's discount.

752
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,960
You in Hong Kong,
you'd be dead.

753
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,560
No, not that!
Riggs! Don't!

754
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,400
The insurance...
What the hell?

755
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,680
Hurry up!

756
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,360
Try it sometime.
It's satisfying and therapeutic.

757
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,520
- Saves the cost of shrinks.
- Bad guys can't call the cops.

758
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,360
- Why not? We're already here!
- El Ni o!

759
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,560
I know this guy.

760
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,120
That's the captain.
Hold it!

761
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,840
Remember, no damage!

762
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,440
Shit!

763
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,760
LAPD! I'm commandeering
your bike. Here, $200.

764
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,760
Riggs, I'm coming!

765
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,280
Somebody stole your bike!

766
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,920
Stop!

767
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Police!

768
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,480
Out of the way!

769
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,560
Butler!
Chase the fast one!

770
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,600
You have Alzheimer's?

771
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,440
Stop! Freeze!

772
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,360
Stop in Chinese, motherfucker!
Halt!

773
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,240
Out the way! Police!

774
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,840
He's getting away!

775
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,120
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

776
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,040
Get down! LAPD!

777
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,760
Stop, you little shit!

778
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,120
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

779
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,440
My arm!
I didn't do anything!

780
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,840
I got you covered!

781
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,160
You got the right to remain silent!
So shut the fuck up!

782
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,680
You got the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one...

783
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,320
...we'll provide you with
the dumbest lawyer on Earth!

784
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,880
If you get Johnnie Cochran,
I'll kill you!

785
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,480
Don't jump!
You're going to be a father!

786
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,000
Don't jump!

787
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,440
Hold on!

788
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,880
Hold on! I'll get you!

789
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,120
Riggs, don't move!

790
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,520
I won't move.

791
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,880
Hold on! I got you!

792
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,400
You'll catch me?

793
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,640
No, I won't catch you.
I got a dumpster here.

794
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,840
You didn't do nothing.
Why'd you run?

795
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,920
Butters!

796
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,640
- Get over here!
- Shit!

797
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,840
Hurry up!

798
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,360
Come on!

799
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,240
Hold on!

800
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
A bit more to the left!

801
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,320
Move this there!
Now!

802
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,840
No, the other left!

803
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,160
Make up your mind!

804
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,080
You couldn't find something smaller?!

805
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,520
It's all I could find!

806
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,160
I got it here!
Now, jump on "three"!

807
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,280
Ready?

808
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,400
Ass first!
It breaks the fall!

809
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,280
One...

810
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,440
...two, three!
Son of a bitch!

811
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,000
You all right?

812
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,520
I should've had him.

813
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,160
Damn right, you should've!

814
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,200
Who's your partner?

815
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,320
- Son of a bitch!
- I don't have a partner!

816
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,800
The guy you ran with!

817
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,560
I'm a waiter.

818
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,040
You guys pull a gun,
try to kill me!

819
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,760
You physically abuse me.
I want my lawyer!

820
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,640
If you're a waiter,
what's today's special?

821
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,680
What's today?

822
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,720
Wednesday!

823
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,960
Sweet and sour pork,
barbecue spareribs...

824
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,640
Shut up!

825
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,160
Next time, don't run!
Stay still!

826
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,800
Johnnie Cochran!

827
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,440
He fight for me!

828
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,880
<i>Mao began helping in the fields</i>
<i>when he was 6 years old.</i>

829
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,400
<i>- He led a rebellion early against his</i>
<i>domineering father.</i>

830
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,160
<i>Finally, Mao left home</i>
<i>to continue his schooling.</i>

831
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,480
<i>Those were troubled times. Old China</i>
<i>dissolved in a welter of unrest...</i>

832
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,040
- Sorry, Sergeant Murtaugh.
- Sit, please.

833
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,800
And it's Roger.

834
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,680
- It's your chair.
- Really, it's fine. Sit.

835
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,240
Something to drink?

836
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,480
Tequila?

837
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,440
Thank you so much.

838
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,320
From Mexico.

839
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,520
This can't be the first time
you had tequila, Hong.

840
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,200
- Yes.
- No!

841
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,520
Bread.

842
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,120
Bread.

843
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,960
Toast!

844
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,720
Yeah, toast!

845
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
Bread!

846
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,800
You know anybody here?

847
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,160
My uncle.

848
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,000
He pay so we can come to America.

849
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,920
You been in contact with him?

850
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,520
No. I leave message.

851
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,200
What's your uncle do?

852
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,200
In China, he's artist.

853
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,680
An artist?

854
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,440
It's tough leaving home, huh?

855
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,240
In America...

856
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,440
...my children have chance
to make good life.

857
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,640
We want the best for our children.

858
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,640
And our grandchildren!

859
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,800
You believe
I'm a grandfather?

860
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,880
That's right! Little Ping!

861
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,080
You're a grandpa!

862
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,800
Where's the time go?

863
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,760
Don't know.

864
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,200
Have no watch.

865
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,880
You have no watch?

866
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,440
Here.

867
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,000
This is my pop's. Take it.

868
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,840
He got it when he retired
from the force.

869
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,840
No, I cannot!

870
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,440
I want you to have it.

871
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,320
It belonged to a good man.
It ought to belong to another good man.

872
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,880
Thank you so much...

873
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,960
...Roger.

874
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,520
Shit!

875
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,640
Hold him!

876
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,840
Push him off!

877
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,800
Get him!

878
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,600
What's wrong?

879
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,520
It's the shoulder.

880
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,640
It's an old injury.
I'll have to toss in the towel.

881
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,200
It happens periodically.

882
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,120
I was just getting going too.
You're lucky, kid.

883
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,240
- You're lucky he didn't kill you.
- You owe me a rematch!

884
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,960
- Anytime you want.
- I might even train for it.

885
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,320
Better bring your own paramedic too.

886
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,440
- I'll get ice for that shoulder.
- It's okay.

887
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,760
There's nothing wrong with my shoulder.

888
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,040
I was faking it.

889
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,040
Faking it?

890
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,760
Gomez was killing me out there.
I didn't have anything left.

891
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,760
I told you that kid was good.

892
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,560
He's good, but it's not all him.

893
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,840
I've been feeling it lately.
You know the other...

894
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,400
Like, on the ship
when that guy nailed me.

895
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,880
And yesterday I couldn't catch him.

896
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,080
I just thought,
I'm out of shape or something.

897
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,920
You know.
But it's more than that.

898
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,640
It's like,
I hate to say this but...

899
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,960
You're getting too old for this shit.

900
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,480
How about that?

901
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,080
Finally.

902
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,440
No, but I can't be.
I mean, I'm only...

903
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,120
- Jesus.
- Yeah, you're only.

904
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,800
Can't beat the clock, Riggs.

905
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,440
Murphy's right. We're dinosaurs.
What'll I do?

906
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,360
Accept it.

907
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,160
Like I do.

908
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,840
No. Bullshit!

909
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,760
I won't accept it.

910
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,400
I'll will it not to happen.

911
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,240
You're going to will it?

912
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,360
I'm not too old for this shit.

913
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,320
I'm not too old for this shit.
We're not too old for this shit.

914
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,560
We're not too old for this shit.
We're not too old for...

915
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,920
Say it like you believe it.

916
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,200
We're not too old for this shit.

917
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,760
I'm not going to buy
a hemorrhoid cushion.

918
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,880
I won't get corns!

919
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,400
I got corns!

920
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,480
I won't wear a suit!

921
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,000
What's wrong with wearing a suit?

922
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,680
How's it going, Captain?

923
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,680
Thanks a lot, guys.
Very funny!

924
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,000
That cop tried to strip-search me!

925
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,840
- You get his phone number?
- Funny.

926
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,600
Sugar-glazed with jelly.
Thanks, Leo.

927
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,680
- What happened? The scratches.
- A dog.

928
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,720
A dog catch you
drinking out of his bowl?

929
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,080
I'm working on
an important P.I. Case.

930
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,480
Did the dog hire you?

931
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,720
No! The people that
lost the dog hired me.

932
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,960
Sounds like a big case.

933
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,480
It is a big case, Mr. Big Shot.
It's an expensive dog.

934
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,520
- A Bolshoi.
- Borzoi.

935
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,040
Whatever, whatever!

936
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,040
And you found it?

937
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,800
Sort of.
Listen to what happens.

938
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,240
Instead of going looking for the dog,
I went to the pound.

939
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,280
I take the dog home, dye him.
It looks exactly like their dog.

940
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,840
Dog was a real rat, though.

941
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,840
He scratched me.
But I got the job done.

942
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,000
Some kind of P.I. Business you got.

943
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,200
Douche Ventura, pet infective.

944
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,040
It's grand theft.

945
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,960
With trickery, it's a felony.

946
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,800
It is?
You guys are always kidding.

947
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,080
I get it. Here comes
that touchy kid. I'm not here.

948
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,240
Putter!

949
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,840
The guy you chased in Chinatown?

950
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,400
His gun matched slugs
on the bodies on the boat.

951
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,480
He's your shooter.

952
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,840
Guy that got away from me.

953
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,440
He didn't get far.
They found him on a rooftop nearby.

954
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,280
Strangled.
And pigeons ate his eyeballs.

955
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,360
Cool.

956
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,480
Excuse me.

957
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,360
I hate these phones!
You get a call, they cut you off.

958
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,960
You make a call, they cut you off!

959
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,400
You know what they're doing?
They fuck you with cell phones.

960
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,880
They love when you get cut off.
You know why?

961
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,520
When you call back...

962
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,480
...they charge you for the first
minute again at that high rate.

963
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,720
If you're able to call back...

964
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,320
...because the 3-hour battery
you got only lasts 20 minutes.

965
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,360
If you're behind a hill, it goes...

966
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,320
Or you go through a tunnel.
And they keep making it smaller!

967
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,040
You know why?
So you can lose it.

968
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,480
So you buy more phones.
I never lost my mother's phone!

969
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,920
Take you two hours to make
a long-distance call.

970
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,760
I messed up! Hang up.
Got to do it again!

971
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,880
I never lost my
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit phone.

972
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,680
And scanners! They get your
number and call all over the world!

973
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,280
Somebody took my number
and called Afghanistan!

974
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,480
I don't know what fucking
Afghanistan look like.

975
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,560
Even if I did, I would not talk
to their Afghan ass for 3 hours!

976
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
I won't talk to my daddy for 3 hours!

977
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,720
They fuck you with the cell phones!

978
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,720
You know when you go to a drive-through?
Hold on.

979
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,440
Why am I talking...?

980
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,560
- Leo Getz, private investigator.
- Private investigator?

981
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,720
I wondered if you'd
investigate my privates.

982
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,840
Investigate what?

983
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,560
My privates, you stupid shit.
Shut the fuck up!

984
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,480
Very funny!
You're costing me money.

985
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,600
$3 to answer a call.
They fuck me, now you!

986
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,360
You're tough when on the phone.

987
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,240
Right!
Telephone tough guy.

988
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,920
Why are we talking on the phone?

989
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,200
Get out of here.
Go home!

990
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,880
What happened to your face?

991
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,320
"No" means no!

992
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,880
He'll like me, I can tell.

993
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,280
He'd be the first.

994
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,760
Whatever! Whatever!

995
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,240
You know, we should hire Leo.

996
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,760
Hire Leo?

997
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,840
He can follow Uncle Benny around.

998
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,720
- Benny'll see him.
- Yeah!

999
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,560
- He'll drive him nuts.
- Benny'll shoot him.

1000
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,560
Let's hire him!

1001
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,400
I smell like stale coffee.

1002
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,160
Why do you care if I go home
and change shirts?

1003
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,520
A coffee stain's not something
that'd bother me.

1004
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,960
Look at the way you dress.

1005
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,160
What's that supposed to mean?

1006
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,320
I don't have nifty suits like you.
Not many cops do.

1007
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,240
What's that supposed to mean?

1008
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,360
I've wondered,
where's the money coming from?

1009
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,360
Where do you think?

1010
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,520
- Where do you think?
- I don't know.

1011
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,560
- It's none of my business.
- You don't know!

1012
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,480
Trish gave me some money.

1013
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,720
Money from my Aunt Anne, who died.

1014
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,840
All right. Sorry.

1015
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,880
Whose car is that?

1016
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,040
I don't know.

1017
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,440
It looks like a full house
for Lamaze class.

1018
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,760
You know that car?

1019
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,640
Here you go, Captains.

1020
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,440
No charge for the ride.

1021
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,400
- Rianne and Lorna are here.
- I'll put it on your account, Captain.

1022
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Hey, honey.

1023
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,960
What's going on?
I came home to change my shirt...

1024
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,360
Why are you here?

1025
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,040
They took the Hongs.

1026
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,840
Shit!

1027
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,360
Drop it.

1028
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,760
Girls, get out!

1029
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,760
Look who we got here.

1030
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,880
- Uncle Benny's friend.
- Hey, Bruce.

1031
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,240
Nice pajamas.

1032
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,760
Where are the Hongs?

1033
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,760
Drop your guns.

1034
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,440
- Drop them!
- Okay, take it easy.

1035
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,120
Don't stand for that, honey.

1036
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:19,960
Son of a bitch!

1037
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,280
Let the women go.

1038
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,120
I can't breathe!

1039
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,960
Son of a bitch!

1040
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,240
I'll be damned!
Thanks, kid!

1041
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,400
Ping, cut us loose!

1042
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Cut me loose!

1043
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,480
Go ahead, cut me.

1044
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,560
It's all right.

1045
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,760
You okay, honey?

1046
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,920
I owe you one, kid.

1047
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,720
- The keys to your car?
- They're in the car.

1048
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,800
We need a radio.

1049
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,640
We have to go.

1050
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,600
How will we find them?
We got to catch them assholes!

1051
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,600
<i>- 3-William-56, this is Air 12.</i>
- We need your eyes, guys.

1052
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,040
Looking for a black Mercedes
and a black Continental.

1053
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,880
<i>Vicinity of Ladera at the 210 freeway.</i>

1054
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,280
Black Mercedes and black Continental?

1055
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,320
<i>Shouldn 't be hard</i>
<i>to find in this town.</i>

1056
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,720
Just give it a shot, will you?

1057
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,960
<i>- Be cooperative.</i>
- That's a roger.

1058
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,560
Will wonders never cease?

1059
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,600
<i>We've got 2 black Mercedes,</i>
<i>one heading east, one west.</i>

1060
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,480
<i>Eastbound's on the Valley View ramp.</i>

1061
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,000
We'll take it.
Locate the Continental.

1062
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,320
- Is it the right one?
- I don't know.

1063
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,440
We're going east and China's east.

1064
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,600
- China's west too.
- We can't divide.

1065
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,760
Think positive!

1066
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,480
You crossed two lanes!

1067
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,840
You see him?

1068
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,640
Watch the road!

1069
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,000
I'd give my right arm for a siren!

1070
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,920
Why'd they take the Hongs?

1071
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,800
Maybe they're shaking them down
for more money.

1072
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,320
Hong's uncle paid already.
He got in touch with his uncle.

1073
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,800
He left him a message.
It's how they know where I live.

1074
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,880
There's the son of a bitch right there!

1075
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,080
Bastards left us to burn!
I want to talk with them.

1076
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,240
You don't have any guns!

1077
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,800
Get me near this trailer.

1078
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:56,920
But you're driving!

1079
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,120
No, you're driving!

1080
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,520
There's cruise control.
Just steer!

1081
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,840
Why make shit complicated?

1082
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,160
Closer. Don't be shy.
Get up there!

1083
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,680
Closer! Closer!

1084
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,000
That's it!

1085
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,800
Here, asshole!
Come in!

1086
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,960
I need to ask you something.
Where's the Hongs?

1087
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,840
Where's the Hongs?
Where are they?

1088
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,680
Get him!

1089
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,640
<i>Highway Patrol, this is William-356,</i>
<i>southbound on highway!</i>

<i>Oversized trailer.</i>

LAPD! Pull over!

1093
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,560
Pull over! See that?!

1094
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,480
Right! Fuck you!

1095
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,480
I got an ass with a phony badge
trying to pull me over!

1096
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,120
Get away from my boy!

1097
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,680
Son of a bitch!

01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,840
I got you!

1099
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,320
Get in here!

1100
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,680
Get the fuck in here!

1101
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Ready?

1102
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,360
- Welcome back.
- What a drag!

1103
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,840
- Thanks, Rog.
- And the Hongs?

1104
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,680
We'll ask the other guy. Go!

1105
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,920
Pull over! Son of a bitch!

1106
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,280
Keep your hands inside, then!

1107
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,400
Out of the way!

1108
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,600
Wait! There he is!

1109
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,000
Keep going!

1110
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,040
We're gaining!

1111
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,560
I got him!

1112
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
You okay?

1113
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,160
Yeah, I think
my heart's still beating.

1114
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,640
Maybe a little too close.

1115

Very soon.

1121
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,480
Brother... it's been a long time.

1122
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,920
It'll be our time again soon.

1123
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,800
America has many laws.

1124
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,320
But written by men.

1125
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,120
Money can change everything.

1126
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,600
- Sorry about your loss.
- Thank you.

1127
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,440
How's my hero?

1128
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,040
He's a little sad,
talking about his mom and dad.

1129
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,360
Here's Butters.

1130
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,080
How's it going?

1131
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,240
Why are you here?

1132
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,160
I heard it on the radio.
I'm sorry about your house.

1133
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,920
This is Detective...

1134
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,760
Butters.

1135
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,480
Trish, my wife.

1136
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,840
Nick, Carrie...

1137
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,080
...Rianne.

1138
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,360
Everybody okay?

1139
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,040
You know who did this?

1140
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,520
It was Benny.

1141
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,280
Leo!

1142
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,760
- You got a phone?
- The little Fonzie guy?

1143
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,280
That's him.

1144
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,520
- You be okay?
- We'll be all right.

1145
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,120
Call me.

1146
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,720
He's there?
We'll be right there.

1147
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,640
- Butters, can you drive us?
- Yeah, let's do it.

1148
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,440
Leo's got him at the dentist.
Let's go!

1149
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,520
Sit down.

1150
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,840
<i>Captain Murtaugh...</i>

1151
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,400
...I know this is a bad time...

1152
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,520
...but there's something
you need to know about me.

1153
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,760
I think I know what it is.

1154
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,200
You do?

1155
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,920
It's okay.

1156
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,000
It is?

1157
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,440
People have the right to do
what makes them happy.

1158
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,840
Just don't expect me to like it.

1159
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,360
I know this must be hard for you.

1160
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,800
It's impossible for me!

1161
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,680
I hoped we'd get together
for the holidays, say Christmas.

1162
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:14,040
Why should we get together
and see each other on Christmas?

1163
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,800
- I'm trying to reach out.
- Reach somewhere else!

1164
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,480
Do what you want,
but leave me out of it.

1165
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,360
- I got it.
- I don't want to hear about it.

1166
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:23,880
Not a word.

1167
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:28,160
Why you grinning?
Think about how we can talk to Benny.

1168
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,240
I got it all worked out.

1169
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,440
What's the matter?

1170
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,880
My ass hurts.

1171
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,160
My tooth!
Is this a dentist or proctologist?

1172
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,240
- Please be quiet.
- I'm trying! I'm in pain!

1173
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,160
Why don't you go see
your own dentist?

1174
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,800
My dentist's in Detroit or I'd go!

1175
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,560
- Oh, brother!
- Oh, brother?! Get the dentist!

1176
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,160
I'm sorry to bother you.
It's an emergency.

1177
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,520
A man walked in off the street.

1178
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,240
He's in a lot of pain.
You better come.

1179
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,720
Okay, you can come in now!

1180
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,240
- Leo can pull this off?
- Leo's got a B.S. In B.S.

1181
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,640
Coast is clear.

1182
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,280
Talk to the hand!
One second.

1183
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,040
- Wait a minute.
- Let me do my job!

1184
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,160
You hurt me, I'll stick
an egg roll up your ass.

1185
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,720
Don't be alarmed.
It's only a drill.

1186
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,040
Don't say a word.

1187
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,440
Shut up.

1188
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,000
Where are the Hongs?
Open wide and tell me.

1189
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,480
I don't know any Hongs.

1190
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,360
Their uncle paid you
to get them out of China.

1191
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,640
More smuggling?
We went through that.

1192
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,160
We're going through it again.

1193
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,960
I have nothing to say.

1194
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,360
These look very interesting.

1195
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,960
You're not going to use it.

1196
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,600
You won't shoot me.

1197
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,880
- You're lousy cops.
- We're good cops.

1198
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,640
This will settle him down.

1199
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,160
Breathe, Uncle Benny.
Breathe!

1200
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,240
Crank up the nitrous.

1201
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,120
Crank that baby up.

1202
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,080
You said it wouldn't hurt!

1203
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,720
I'm holding this. Go ahead.

1204
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,440
Deep! Right down to your toes.

1205
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,560
- He's wasted!
- Have some more.

1206
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,600
He'll talk.

1207
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,960
Good, breathe.

1208
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,240
- That's me.
- That's you.

1209
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,760
Now, where are the Hongs?

1210
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,280
- What's <i>renminbi</i> mean?
<i>- Renminbi</i> means...

1211
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,480
<i>... renminbi.</i>

1212
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,600
- You're a funny guy.
- This guy's wasting our time.

1213
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,920
Time!

1214
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,440
Time for Four Fathers!

1215
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,320
Washington, Jefferson?
Those guys?

1216
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,640
Roosevelt?

1217
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,720
I'm sleeping with my wife's 2 sisters.

1218
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,320
You lucky son of a bitch!

1219
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,840
That's a good one.

1220
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,800
Not so good...

1221
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,920
...when my wife finds out.

1222
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,560
I don't need needles!

1223
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,960
Let's shoot his legs with Novocain...

1224
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,640
...and watch him
try to get out of here.

1225
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,360
What you got in your hands there?

1226
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,840
A nut cup.

1227
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,720
I got some big nuts!

1228
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,880
That's nitrous...

1229
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,880
...oxide!

1230
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,160
Laughing gas!

1231
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,240
We're stoned!

1232
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,920
Murtaugh! Hurry up!

1233
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,320
That's one funny son-in-law
you got there, Rog.

1234
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,400
After tonight it be too late.

1235
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,360
Too late for what?

1236
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,320
Why'd you call him my son-in-law?

1237
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,360
Uncle Benny? He's too old.

1238
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,400
Buy Four Fathers back
at Four Fathers' store.

1239
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,320
Why's he talking about his ancestors?

1240
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,880
I don't know.

1241
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,640
Why you call him my son-in-law?

1242
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,320
Because I am!

1243
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,920
I thought he was...

1244
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,120
No, I'm...

1245
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,560
Bloody marvelous!

1246
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,360
Your baby is having my baby.

1247
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,680
My baby is having his baby.

1248
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,400
And your baby? Whoa, baby!

1249
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,160
Whoa, baby! My baby!

1250
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,000
What are you doing?

1251
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,360
I couldn't stall anymore.

1252
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,840
What happened?

1253
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,080
Rog, look at this.
Does that hurt?

1254
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,160
Uncle Benny,
anything happens to the Hongs...

1255
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,320
...we'll come back
and rip you a new one.

1256
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,080
That's two for Benny.

1257
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,120
Bloody marvelous!

1258
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,000
- Are you crazy?
- Why did you do that?

1259
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,200
For keeping it from me
and letting me think...

1260
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,240
Hit him, not me.

1261
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,760
As soon as we find the Hongs,
we're getting into this.

1262
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,280
Uncle.

1263
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,960
You're all here?

1264
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,520
All here.

1265
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,600
What's going on?

1266
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,320
As payment for bringing you
to America...

1267
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,520
...your uncle's working for us.

1268
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,600
Now finish the job.

1269
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,640
What job?

1270
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,920
No time to talk now.

1271
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,240
Take them to their new homes...

1272
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,040
...and guarantee their safety.
Then I'll finish.

1273
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,760
Finish now or watch the others die.

1274
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,520
<i>Rimminy</i>?

1275
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,840
A young bimbo? A jumping jiminy?
I don't know.

1276
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,240
<i>I can 't remember.</i>

1277
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,320
No, Riggs. <i>Renminbi.</i>

1278
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,960
Say that again.

1279
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,200
That's it!

1280
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,440
<i>You got it.</i>

1281
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,200
<i>Means, "people's money."</i>

1282
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,440
People's money?

1283
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,960
<i>What else did Benny say?</i>

1284
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,000
<i>He was talking about</i>
<i>buying back his ancestors.</i>

1285
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,040
<i>And about how tonight's...</i>

1286
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,080
...too late.
Mean anything to you?

1287
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,360
No, nothing at all.

1288
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:34,680
And the guy who torched my house?
Benny was afraid of him.

1289
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,680
<i>If Benny's scared,</i>
<i>he's got to be a Chinese Triad.</i>

1290
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,440
<i>Those guys kill anyone</i>
<i>in their way.</i>

1291
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,480
Including cops...

1292
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,480
<i>... and their families.</i>
<i>Watch your asses!</i>

1293
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,240
<i>- Thanks, Ng.</i>
<i>- Keep me posted.</i>

1294
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,880
Pick up your wife, my daughter.

1295
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,320
- I'll get Trish, you get Lorna.
- Her and Ping.

1296
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,320
What?

1297
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,280
You want to get married, don't you?

1298
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,080
No.

1299
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,680
Yes. Yes, I do.

1300
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,680
But if you don't want to, it's okay.

1301
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,000
Why didn't you tell me?

1302
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,920
Because I didn't want to put
any pressure on you.

1303
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,360
If you want to someday, that'd be great.

1304
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,480
If you don't...

1305
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,600
...I love you.

1306
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,880
I'll take you any way I can get you.

1307
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,240
Feel that!

1308
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,640
- Ping, feel the baby!
- He's really dancing.

1309
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,360
He's kicking. You feel him?

1310
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,880
You're okay.

1311
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,640
<i>Riggs. Pick up, Riggs.</i>

1312
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,400
Riggs, it's Murtaugh.

1313
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,760
I'm sick of these fuckers.
Let's just find them and shoot them.

1314
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,720
Meet me and Butters on South Spring.

1315
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,960
<i>What's going on?</i>

1316
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,240
They found my watch.

1317
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,240
They killed Hong, his uncle,
Uncle Benny too. Bodies are in there.

1318
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,840
- Where's the rest of the family?
- They're okay.

1319
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,000
INS raided a Chinese sweatshop.

1320
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:03,760
Hong's family was being held there
and they led them back here.

1321
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,080
They were making funny money.

1322
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,760
Ink's still wet.

1323
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,120
- Where are the faces?
- It's why I call it funny.

1324
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,520
Why are they making Chinese money?

1325
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,600
Can they even exchange it here?

1326
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,040
- Only in China.
<i>- Renminbi.</i>

1327
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,480
I remember.

1328
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,760
Hong's uncle was an artist.
Maybe an engraver.

1329
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:28,760
Bringing over his family could've
been how he was paid for the job.

1330
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,480
- That's thin.
- It's not.

1331
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,000
Keep talking. What?

1332
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:35,320
Benny said something about paying...

1333
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:37,320
...buying back his forefathers.

1334
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,480
What'd you say?

1335
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,800
Benny said something about buying
back his forefathers.

1336
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,680
You said ancestors.

1337
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,640
What's the difference?

1338
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,760
The number four.
Four Fathers.

1339
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,400
They were the top guys
of the Hong Kong Triad.

1340
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,200
They disappeared from prison.

1341
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,480
Reds jailed them when they
took over Hong Kong.

1342
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,440
I bet they're here.

1343
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,760
Damn, we're good.

1344
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,920
Grab Ping. I don't want him
to see the bodies.

1345
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,040
10 to 1, I know where the money is...

1346
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,040
20 to 1 I know where the Four Fathers are.
Let me make a call.

1347
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,440
Don't leave without us.

1348
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,440
Good work!
You must be a detective.

1349
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,280
I have my moments.

1350
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,440
Uncle Benny.

1351
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,480
I was actually starting
to like the old goat.

1352
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,200
Bloody marvelous.

1353
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,520
And it's fried rice, "you plick."

1354
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,280
- Which one is Hong?
- In front of you.

1355
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,520
I want a complete set
of forensics on all three.

1356
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,360
Dads and their kids.

1357
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,880
I'll take care of yours, buddy.

1358
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,560
We got to go!

1359
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,080
- Take care of yourself.
- Where're we going?

1360
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,840
- L.A. Harbor.
- What's there?

1361
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,800
It's a foreign trade zone.

1362
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,480
Shady deals with the Chinese military.

1363
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,320
<i>It's run by a corrupt Chinese general.</i>

1364
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:13,240
<i>I got it, a corrupt Chinese general</i>
<i>brought the Four Fathers here...</i>

1365
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,320
<i>... and the Triad's</i>
<i>buying their release.</i>

1366
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,080
<i>That's what Uncle Benny meant</i>
<i>by buying them back.</i>

1367
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,480
<i>That general will shit</i>
<i>when he sees the money's counterfeit.</i>

1368
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,240
<i>Let's tell him.</i>

1369
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,480
Hi, gang.

1370
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,920
LAPD.

1371
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,520
I saw Hong.

1372
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,440
This is what Benny meant
by buying the Four Fathers.

1373
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:19,440
Harpo, Groucho, Chico and Fucko.
How are you, boys?

1374
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,960
Who's the naughty general?

1375
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,200
Who's been lining his pockets?

1376
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,080
Naughty!
Speaky English?

1377
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:28,880
What do you want?

1378
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,280
See this?

1379
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,560
I hope you need lots of
toilet paper back home.

1380
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,400
That's all it's good for.

1381
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,560
Take the Four Pops back to China.
We don't give a shit.

1382
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,720
The Four Pops!

1383
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,040
Don't want them no more.
It's counterfeit.

1384
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,680
Triads never prosper
cheating a general.

1385
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,000
See for yourself.

1386
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:04,160
Money losing face.
General losing face.

1387
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,920
Hard when Triad try to sit on it.

1388
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,920
I fucked you. I fucked you!

1389
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,360
We fucked you.

1390
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,720
It's beautiful!

1391
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,400
Don't we get a hand?

1392
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,080
Keep your head down!
Let them shoot each other!

1393
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,560
Watch out!

1394
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,600
Thanks!

1395
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Was this a good idea?

1396
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,280
It was an idea!

1397
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,520
11 in the mag, 1 in the pipe.
You?

1398
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,240
Wheel gun. 6 shots.

1399
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,440
Four!

1400
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,640
Why are you lying to me?

1401
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,040
I.A. Says you're on the take.

1402
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,400
I'm on the take?!

1403
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,640
I think it's crazy!
But you're spending lots of money!

1404
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,560
You ever hear of Ebony Clark?

1405
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,680
Yeah! She writes those
cheesy sex novels!

1406
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,720
Are you boinking her?

1407
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,880
No, I'm not boinking Ebony Clark!

1408
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,800
Trish is Ebony Clark.

1409
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,800
You are boinking her!

1410
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,720
Yeah, I'm boinking her.

1411
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,800
Too embarrassing to tell anybody.

1412
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,560
Yeah, I don't blame you.

1413
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,080
- She makes lots of money.
- How many you got?

1414
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,600
Two.

1415
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,840
I'll look for more ammo.

1416
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:31,840
Who's in white pajamas?

1417
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,120
Wah Sing Ku. The Four Father
with him is his older brother.

1418
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,640
No kidding?

1419
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,760
- Hey, Butters.
- Shit! Shit!

1420
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,920
Now you got my name right.

1421
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,040
I'm out.
I got to find some rounds.

1422
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,280
I'll help you.

1423
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,760
Never been shot before.

1424
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,360
Take care of my son-in-law.

1425
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:50,000
- You all right?
- No, I got my ass kicked again.

1426
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,000
Shit, I'm out.

1427
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,520
I hit the bastard. I thought
I missed him. Where'd they go?

1428
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,480
Come on!

1429
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,520
We got Door Number 1,
Number 2, or Number 3.

1430
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,040
- Looks like Number 2, Monty.
- Let's go.

1431
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,680
What's behind Door Number 2?
Bingo.

1432
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,920
Now you've done it.

1433
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,720
Now he's really pissed.

1434
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,920
Son of a bitch will be a handful.

1435
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,560
Since I met you, I've done some
hairy shit. But this won't happen.

1436
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,360
I'm going to be a grandfather...

1437
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,760
...and you and Lorna will have a baby.

1438
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,240
He ain't worth dying for, Riggs.

1439
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,480
Yeah, you're right.

1440
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:13,000
If he gets away we can
track him down later...

1441
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,040
...with a howitzer or something.

1442
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:18,240
Your son-in-law's bleeding.
We should get him and go.

1443
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,640
- Shit, it's raining.
- I'm too old for this shit.

1444
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,400
Guy's too damn good.

1445
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,600
How'd he do that thing with the gun?

1446
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,720
He took my gun apart with one move.
How'd he do that?

1447
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,080
How?

1448
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,080
Yeah, okay.

1449
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,440
Let's go ask him.

1450
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,640
Are you up there?

1451
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,520
Are you all right?

1452
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,400
Where are you, Riggs?

1453
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,800
Will it to me, Riggs!

1454
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,560
Where are you?

1455
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:35,960
Will it to me!

1456
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,880
Will me, Riggs.

1457
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,280
You going to have a baby. Will me!

1458
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,800
You son of a bitch.
God! Will me!

1459
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,760
I hear you, Riggs.

1460
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,520
I got you! I'm coming!

1461
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,320
I heard you, Riggs!

1462
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,760
You willed me to it!

1463
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,520
What took you so long?
What took you so long?

1464
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:55,200
What the hell do you mean?

1465
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,520
I was knocked down over here!
I couldn't even get up!

1466
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,880
Come back here!

1467
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,840
Let's go home, man.

1468
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,080
Let's get out of here.

1469
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,160
I haven't been here enough
lately, Vicky. I'm sorry.

1470
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,600
I need to talk to you about Lorna.
Me and Lorna.

1471
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,400
It's like this.
She wants to get married...

1472
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:33,200
...and I love her.
I won't lie to you. I do.

1473
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:36,120
And I want to make her happy.

1474
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,400
I'm looking for help here, honey.

1475
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,680
I don't know what to do.

1476
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:47,320
Funny talking to you about
this stuff...

1477
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,200
You want to get yourself shot?

1478
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:58,720
What the hell are you doing here?

1479
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,400
I was tailing you.

1480
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:02,760
Sorry.

1481
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,760
I'll leave you alone.
I guess you want to be alone.

1482
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,800
I'd appreciate it.

1483
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:17,680
When I was a kid I had a pet frog.

1484
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,880
What?

1485
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,520
Give me a second.
Let me tell you this.

1486
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,520
I had this pet frog, name was Froggy.

1487
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,760
He was my best friend in the world.

1488
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,160
I didn't have lots of friends.
In fact...

1489
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:33,600
...I had no friends.

1490
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,560
I used to kiss the frog too.

1491
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,640
I thought maybe...

1492
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:44,360
...it would turn into a princess
since I was a boy.

1493
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,160
And it could be...

1494
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,600
...my mother.

1495
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,480
They told me that
she left or something.

1496
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:54,800
And my father was no bargain.

1497
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,560
And so, just the frog...

1498
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,600
...Froggy, was my friend.

1499
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,960
I loved him and took him
everywhere with me.

1500
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,080
I was riding my bike one day...

1501
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,440
...he jumped out of the box...

1502
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,560
...and I ran him over
with the back tire.

1503
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:10,800
I killed him.

1504
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,800
I was really heartbroken. Really.

1505
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,320
He was my best friend,
the only thing I ever loved.

1506
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:20,440
And then I met you...

1507
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,040
...and Roger.

1508
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,840
You looked after me
a lot more than you had to.

1509
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,200
I'm terrible to you, Leo.

1510
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,800
No, it's okay.

1511
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,360
It's okay.

1512
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,280
You're my family...

1513
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:35,400
...and my friends.

1514
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:40,560
You're not better friends than Froggy,
just different.

1515
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,800
I just thought that
might be relevant.

1516
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,200
Okay, I'll leave you alone now.

1517
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,240
I got a funny f...

1518
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:02,640
What's wrong?!

1519
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,560
I'm having a baby.

1520
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,080
Lorna beeped me.

1521
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,640
Yes, it's Lorna.
She's having the baby.

1522
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,880
- I'll get the car.
- I'll be behind you.

1523
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,920
You picked a strange angel, honey.

1524
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,640
But I got the message.

1525
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,400
I got the message.

1526
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,240
I'll always have this.

1527
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,160
Always have you.

1528
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,400
In here and here.

1529
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,760
Thanks, honey.

1530
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:44,000
I got to go. Bye.

1531
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:46,280
I am not ready to have this baby!

1532
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,920
You're as ready as you're going to be.

1533
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,720
Fine! Just wheel me in.

1534
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:53,200
My legs are staying closed!

1535
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,040
Give me this!

1536
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,760
Ma'am, let go!

1537
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:00,000
I am a police officer!
And I am not ready!

1538
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:07,560
Are you all right?

1539
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,280
- Are you the husband?
- Yes.

1540
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:10,680
Honey, are you all right?

1541
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,800
No, I'm not.

1542
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:13,880
I said I didn't want
to get married, but I do.

1543
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,800
I want to be a wife
before I'm a mother.

1544
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,280
I know you don't want to.

1545
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,840
- You said "okay"?
- Yes, I did. Okay.

1546
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:23,640
Let's do it.

1547
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,000
He said okay.

1548
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,680
- Congratulations.
- He said okay, Leo.

1549
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:30,480
Oh, my God!

1550
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,360
What's that smell?

1551
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:35,640
I was on my way to the toilet
and she grabbed me.

1552
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,520
- I'm so sorry.
- Have a nice baby!

1553
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,600
I'm so sorry.

1554
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,200
Will you marry me?

1555
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,520
You bet I will.

1556
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:54,560
Let's go.

1557
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:57,240
I'm not going! Wait!

1558
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,000
- Get a minister.
- Now?

1559
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:03,040
Now. We're getting married.
Here comes another one.

1560
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,280
We need a license...

1561
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,520
I want to hear it
before the baby comes!

1562
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,640
It's coming now.

1563
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,520
Listen, I am getting married
or there is no baby.

1564
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,200
This could be an aspect
of a transition phase.

1565
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:16,240
This is no goddamn aspect
of a transition phase!

1566
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,240
Honey, everybody, calm down.

1567
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,080
Calm down. Okay?

1568
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:22,720
Get a priest, minister, anything.

1569
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,360
Go get a priest!
Goddamn it, Leo!

1570
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:27,320
I got it. Okay.

1571
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:29,520
Pant, pant, blow.
Remember Lamaze class?

1572
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,440
Pant, blow. Come on!

1573
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,000
But I want to say "I do."

1574
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,000
Here he is!

1575
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,560
This is Rabbi Gelb.

1576
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:39,760
A rabbi?

1577
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,360
You said anything.

1578
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,880
He'll do.

1579
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:44,600
For what I'll do?

1580
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:47,080
We'd like you to marry us.
Please.

1581
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:48,800
- You're Jewish?
- Not necessarily.

1582
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:50,320
- You got a license?
- No.

1583
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:52,280
Please don't go!

1584
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,480
She needs to hear the words
before the baby comes.

1585
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:59,200
Are you both serious?
I don't have time for hijinks.

1586
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:00,720
We're very serious.

1587
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,880
I could do it.
It wouldn't be official.

1588
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,640
I just want to hear the words.

1589
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,920
What the hell! Your names?

1590
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,640
I'm Martin and this is Lorna.

1591
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:10,480
Martin and Lorna.

1592
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,960
What am I doing?
How do the <i>goyim</i> do this?

1593
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,080
Dearly beloved!

1594
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:21,840
Dearly beloved,
marriage is a spiritual union...

1595
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,840
Faster!
She's heading for the home stretch.

1596
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,320
Martin, will you take
Lorna to be your wife?

1597
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:31,880
Will you honor, love, etc...

1598
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,080
...till death do you part?
- I will.

1599
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,880
Lorna, will you take Martin
to be your husband?

1600
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,720
- I do.
- The same thing.

1601
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:41,080
I pronounce you man and wife.

1602
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,440
You may kiss the bride.
You already did.

1603
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,520
- Let's go.
- No, wait!

1604
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,080
Hold it!

1605
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,520
What is it?

1606
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:51,080
Let me have this glass!

1607
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:54,040
No, goddamn it!
What are you doing?!

1608
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,400
Talk to the hand!
I'll be right back.

1609
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:00,680
You know how long it took me
to fill that thing? All day!

1610
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:03,680
This is unsanitary.
What is this?

1611
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,720
- Break the glass.
- I'll get piss on my shoes!

1612
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:07,720
You got to do this!

1613
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,920
<i>Mazel tov</i>!

1614
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:14,080
Come back here,
you little son of a bitch!

1615
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:15,560
Pant, pant, blow.

1616
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,120
Leo, please.

1617
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:21,800
Your work is over here.
I think someone else needs you.

1618
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:28,800
Good luck, Lorna, Riggs.

1619
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,560
Thanks a lot.

1620
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,760
Stick around.
Meet the kid.

1621
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,080
Good luck, Lorna!

1622
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,760
Here it comes.

1623
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,000
Here he is.

1624
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:56,600
He's looking right at you.
He knows it's you.

1625
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:02,880
Rog, look what I found.

1626
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:05,840
- Look at that.
- What a beauty!

1627
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,240
Look at those eyes!

1628
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:11,200
- He looks like his mother.
- Yes, he does.

1629
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,480
Murtaugh!

1630
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:16,560
No, Butters!

1631
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,840
Butters' baby.
Better not be Murtaugh.

1632
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,600
It's Butters.

1633
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,600
Look at that baby.

1634
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,800
Look at the hair.

1635
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:28,400
That's my baby!

1636
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,520
Look at her. You're so cute.
Look at you!

1637
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:34,320
27 people, nobody thought
of bringing a camera?

1638
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,080
Leo, your plastic's flaccid.

1639
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:39,680
These machines wreck your plastic,
then give you the camera.

1640
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:42,200
The camera doesn't work.
They're trying to...

1641
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,920
What are you doing here?

1642
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,120
Look at these two babies.

1643
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:52,400
A little something from the squad.

1644
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,320
- Give back the captain badges.
- Why?

1645
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:00,720
Congratulations, you're sergeants again.
The city's self-insured.

1646
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,920
I thought they'd make us president.

1647
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:06,240
By the way, Grandpa,
you owe the chief one.

1648
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,840
He went to the INS...

1649
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:10,480
...and they're giving asylum
to the Hongs.

1650
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,920
All right!

1651
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,200
We're going to take a picture.

1652
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,480
Squeeze together.
Candy stripers out.

1653
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,080
Out! Okay. Out!

1654
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,920
I can't.
There's not enough room.

1655
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,480
You got to back up.

1656
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:31,280
I'm taking big steps!

1657
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:33,000
Get this guy to take it.

1658
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,800
Doc, can you take a picture
of all of us?

1659
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,000
It's my best man, after all.

1660
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,840
Get my grandbaby in it too.

1661
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:44,160
Are you all friends?

1662
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,320
No. We're family!

1663
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,400
Okay, on 3.

1664
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:50,600
One, two, three!
