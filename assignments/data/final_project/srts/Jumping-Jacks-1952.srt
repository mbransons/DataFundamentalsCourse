1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,331
She abused me,

3
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,507
which, of course,
means she's crazy about me.

4
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,031
The way she keeps
runnin' after me.

5
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:44,773
Oh, well,
I might as well give in.

6
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:48,211
I just simply can't escape
her desire to love me.

7
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,653
Oh, Hap, you're wonderful.

8
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,524
I am?

9
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,831
Gee, every other girl that ever
kissed me thought I was a square.

10
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,659
The way the act went over tonight,
well...

11
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,487
Well,
it was the biggest thrill I ever had.

12
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,837
Didn't you get a thrill,
too?Yeah.

13
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,405
Every other girl that ever
kissed me thought I was a square.

14
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,494
Hap, you said that before.Oh,
yeah.

15
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:56,192
Well,
aren't you happy the act went over?

16
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,631
Oh, sure, Betsy. And-And I wanna
thank you for having confidence in me.

17
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:03,591
You see, when my partner,
Chick, went in the paratroopers,

18
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:05,723
I never thought I'd be able
to do an act without him.

19
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,856
Well,
you're doing a darn good one.

20
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,684
Well, you're pretty... Oh,
I'm in it, Hap,

21
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,642
but you're the act.

22
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:14,341
No. W-We're a team.

23
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,865
And, I'd like us to be a team.

24
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,258
I mean, all the time.

25
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:22,218
And, w-well, Betsy,

26
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,003
I-I-I was wonderin' if
maybe tonight we could...

27
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:28,790
Now, Hap,
we do a swell act on stage.

28
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,706
Let's just keep it that way,
huh?

29
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:34,012
The army turned me down
because I have a bum ear.

30
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:35,536
But I heard you say no.

31
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,668
You know something, Hap?

32
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:40,367
You're just about
the nicest boy I know.

33
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,242
Here, here, Betsy,
as your agent, I get 10% of that.

34
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,897
Oh, fine thing. I don't suppose
you have anything for us.

35
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,594
Yeah,
I sure do. Earl White liked you,

36
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:52,379
and he wants to see us at 11:30,
Wednesday.

37
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,554
Earl White! Yeah.

38
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:55,904
Oh, Sam,
that's wonderful. Isn't it, Hap?

39
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:58,776
Yeah. That means Broadway.Yeah.

40
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,561
The big time. Yes.

41
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:04,086
Sit down,
Sam. You sit here, Betsy.

42
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:08,743
I-I can see it all now.
It's opening night.

43
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,788
And everyone's all
seated in their seats,

44
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,051
and they're all dressed up,
too, waitin'.

45
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,098
And then the conductor
comes out to start the show.

46
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:24,585
He smiles at the audience and looks around,
and he gets ready.

47
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,120
And he stops the music.

48
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,817
And the MC is introduced
and he comes out.

49
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,042
Hello there, folks! Just startin'
our show! I'm sorry I'm a little late.

50
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:49,349
But on the way over to the theater,
a panhandler stopped me on the street

51
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:51,394
and said, "Buddy, give me a dime,
will you, and hurry up."

52
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:54,005
I said, "Why hurry up?" He says,
"I'm double-parked."

53
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,573
Ugh! Anyhow,
we'd like to start the show, folks.

54
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:58,488
We'd like to start with
that beautiful chanteuse,

55
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:01,970
the very lovely mademoiselleSally Sack,
and here she comes!

56
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:31,347
And then they clap,
and then the MC comes out again.

57
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,870
He says, "Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,655
"we're goin' to introduce those
two wonderful entertainers.

59
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:38,441
"And here they are,
Betsy Carver and Hap Smith!"

60
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,877
And we come out, Betsy, see,

61
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,401
and we're on the stage, Betsy.

62
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,924
The both of us are out there,
see?

63
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,534
But what are you gonna do?

64
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,188
I don't know, I'm too tired.

65
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,019
Where you been? You
missed the whole show.

66
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,150
Telegram for Hap Smith.

67
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,413
Oh, that's me.

68
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,155
Oh, certainly, the tip.

69
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,767
Anybody got change of a dime?

70
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,334
Okay, keep the whole thing. Thank you,
mister.

71
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:03,597
Oh, that's all right.

72
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:05,686
Excuse me.

73
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,258
If I'd have known
you were that hungry,

74
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,652
I would have brought you
a sandwich.What is it, Hap?

75
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,828
Yeah, what does this mean?

76
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:03,787
I'm sorry. I can't explain.

77
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,529
Where you goin'?

78
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,576
Even I don't know.

79
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:35,471
"Important patriotic mission."

80
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:46,700
"Secrecy essential."

81
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,802
It'd be easier to see if
you took those glasses off.

82
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,760
Oh, I be... I beg your pardon.

83
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,244
Oh, I'm sorry, lady.

84
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,661
Ahem.

85
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,099
Hap! Chick!

86
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:39,622
Hiya, pal!

87
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:48,588
Hey, just like old times,
huh?Yeah.

88
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,634
Sit down. You sit over there. Here,
over here.

89
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,201
Hey, how's your new partner?

90
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,290
Oh,
great. Has something you'll never have.

91
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,031
Yeah? What? Skirts.

92
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,990
Hey, it's good to see you, Hap.

93
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,513
Don't mention my name.

94
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,211
I'm here on a very
secret mission.

95
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:04,473
I know.

96
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:07,650
You know? Sure. I
sent the telegram.

97
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:10,784
Oh, and I thought this was
gonna be something patriotic.

98
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,220
It is. Yeah?

99
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,614
Yeah, look, Hap. Now,
we're in a spot.

100
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,703
See, we're putting on a
show tonight and we need you.

101
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,226
I've been working with Dogface.

102
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:20,054
Wait, Chick,
I-I know from blackface,

103
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:21,925
but I don't know from dogface.

104
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,579
Well, this is Dogface Dolan.

105
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,842
Are you sure?

106
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,322
It's only a nickname.

107
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,019
My folks never
christened me that.

108
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,368
What'd they call you?

109
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,413
Dogface.

110
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:37,027
Now, look, Hap. The big wheel
of this camp is General Timmons.

111
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,725
And he doesn't
like soldier shows.

112
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,683
But our colonel
has finally talked him

113
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,032
into seeing this show.

114
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,425
Now, we've got to sell him.

115
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,601
You and I, Hap,
have got to sell him this show.

116
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,689
It's got to be great.

117
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,952
Or no more shows.

118
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:52,477
If it's great, then plenty of entertainment
for the boys and an extra stripe for Chick.

119
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:55,480
Now, the first thing we have
to do is get you a uniform.

120
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,396
Oh, I got one. Right in
here and it's a real doozy.

121
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,529
Do you want to get us
all landed in the clink?

122
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:03,140
Oh, don't be silly. This is a
trick suit I use in my new act.

123
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,534
We'll see it in a minute.
You can put it on in there.

124
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:07,754
Well,
why can't I change backstage?

125
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,320
Because you're not GI.

126
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,496
This is an all-army show. So?

127
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,369
So,
your being in it is a top military secret.

128
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:17,067
You're not even
supposed to be on the post.

129
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:18,460
Forget you're Hap Smith.

130
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,114
You're Dogface Dolan.

131
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,682
Oh,
I'm Smith out here and I'm Dolan in there.

132
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,859
And if they find out that
Smith ain't Dolan... Bye, fellas.

133
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:29,558
Okay, Hap. I never thought
you'd let your old buddy down.

134
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,648
But... But...

135
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,129
But what if I get
caught? Ain't this illegal?

136
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,913
I'm surprised at you, Hap.

137
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,308
Didn't you once say you'd cut
your arm off up to here for me?

138
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,876
Up to here,
yeah. Up to here, no.

139
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,443
Besides, I have an important
spot in a Broadway show comin' up.

140
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,010
I can't take no chances.

141
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,838
And how about me?

142
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:52,189
I'm in charge of
entertainment in this outfit.

143
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:56,019
Wouldn't you like to see your
old buddy with an extra stripe?

144
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,413
Of course I would.

145
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:00,676
I knew you'd do it,
pal. We can't miss.

146
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,199
Now, you go ahead,
put on your uniform.

147
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,418
We'll see you at the main gate.

148
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,115
Uh-huh. Good luck, Dogface.

149
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,726
Who you callin' dog-face?

150
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,075
You.

151
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,903
Oh! Oh! Dog.

152
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,214
Dogface.

153
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,582
Why, you're all jealous.

154
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:42,022
Hi. Hi.

155
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,938
Well, where are you?

156
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,636
I'm in there someplace.
How do I look?

157
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,203
Gee, I... GI, swell.

158
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,508
That's what I hoped you'd say.

159
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,206
Now, look, listen to me.

160
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:53,642
After you get through the gate,

161
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,122
you can't miss the
main auditorium.

162
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:56,776
Well, why don't you go with me?

163
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,908
I can't. I have to round up
the boys for a quick rehearsal.

164
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,780
I'll see you there.

165
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,303
Then why don't you go with me?

166
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,478
Because you've got my pass.

167
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,219
And hang on to
it. It's my lifeline.

168
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,177
Now, as soon as the show is over,
we'll meet you here. Got it?

169
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,788
Yeah. Show that to him.

170
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,360
Hey, soldier, come here.

171
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:18,493
Let me see your pass.

172
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:19,929
My, but you're inquisitive.

173
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,626
You didn't think I had one, huh?

174
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,932
Well, there it is, smarty.

175
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,586
Ha ha and ho.

176
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,242
Hey, Wilkes. Yeah?

177
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:31,462
If I saw what I think I saw,
I need a psycho test.

178
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,602
Maybe we'll bump into
each other again sometime.

179
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,518
Didn't you forget something?

180
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:44,780
I don't think so.

181
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,086
A little matter of a salute.

182
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,610
And say "sir" to an
officer. You watch it.

183
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:51,091
Oh, oh. Oh, of course,
sir. Yes, sir!

184
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:02,580
Morning, sir.

185
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,234
Good morning.

186
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,671
Details will report to
the orderly room at 0700.

187
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,152
Hello, sir.

188
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:10,458
Hey, soldier!

189
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,895
Yes, sir?

190
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,332
Do I look like a
commissioned officer?

191
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,681
Oh, yes, sir.

192
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,466
What kind of a goon are you?

193
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,860
I'm a sergeant. I
don't rate a salute.

194
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,906
Yes,
sir. And I don't rate no "sir."

195
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,039
Yes.

196
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,171
You're a disgrace to the outfit.

197
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,738
Look at that uniform.
It has more wrinkles

198
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,305
than an unfolded parachute.

199
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,567
Straighten it out!

200
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,137
Why don't you take better care

201
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,269
of your issue?
It's falling apart.

202
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,141
Well, you see,
it was made that way, sir.

203
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:44,100
The Quartermaster Corps issued
that uniform in good condition.

204
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,319
Keep it that way!

205
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:46,711
Well, let me explain, sir.

206
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:47,974
Explain what?

207
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,976
That this pocket
is made to fall off?

208
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,847
And these buttons are
supposed to be loose?

209
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,240
Well,
now I'm all dressed for the summer.

210
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:54,981
Pull up those pants!

211
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,115
Where did a yard bird
like you ever manage

212
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,422
to pick up those fancy
medals? In a pawnshop?

213
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:02,684
Oh, oh, no, sir.

214
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,078
Stop that "sir."

215
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,863
There's one I've
never seen. What is it?

216
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,125
Oh, nothing, nothing.

217
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,692
What's it for?

218
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,086
Slow fire.

219
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,262
And this?

220
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,307
Rapid fire, but please don't...

221
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,613
And this?

222
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,703
Extinguish fire.

223
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,618
Extinguish fire?

224
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,537
Oh. Oh...

225
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,889
Let me at him. I'll bend
those medals around his ears.

226
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,151
Easy, Sarge. Easy, Sarge.

227
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:36,631
Hey, Chick,
he thinks I'm a regular soldier.

228
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,154
Tell him I'm not,
tell him the truth.

229
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:39,895
Of course I'll tell him the truth. You see,
Sarge,

230
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,810
this fellow doesn't
ordinarily look like this.

231
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,986
Why,
he's one of the neatest men in his outfit.

232
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,120
He's only wearin' a trick
uniform for our show tonight.

233
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:50,384
It is, huh? Well,
why doesn't he say so? Tryin' to rib me?

234
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,951
Well, no, he's a little upset.

235
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,822
You know how this
amateur talent is.

236
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,911
Here, amateur talent?

237
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,914
I ask you, Sergeant,
is this amateurish?

238
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,265
"What a rogue and peasant
slave am I..."Hey. Hey.

239
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:05,660
"Is it not monstrous
that the player here...

240
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,270
"Is it not" Knock it off!

241
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:08,445
Ah!

242
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,795
Acting. Theatricals.

243
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,754
What an army.

244
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,103
I remember, in the old days,

245
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,410
when the army wanted
to raise your morale,

246
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:19,195
they'd issue you
a pass and you'd...

247
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:23,286
Sergeant, careful or we'll have
to wash out your mind with soap.

248
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,158
Get him out of my sight!

249
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,464
Relax, watch your blood
pressure. How about a cigar.

250
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:28,726
Have a cigarette.

251
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,037
That's him there, Hap.

252
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:36,386
General Timmons.

253
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,434
Wonder what would
make him laugh.

254
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,568
Blood.

255
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:46,614
Well,
it was nice bein' in the show.

256
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,052
Look,
you stay here. I go on first.

257
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,157
I told you Hap would
make the show.

258
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,376
You were great, Hap.

259
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,203
Oh, no,
Chick. We worked together tonight

260
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:33,814
just like we did
in the old days.

261
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,337
And I sure hope you
make sergeant now.

262
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,208
Me, too. Holy mackerel!

263
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:38,949
I better hurry. I'll
miss the last train.

264
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,560
Oh, don't worry,
Hap. Dogface will have a cab

265
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:41,648
waitin' for you at the gate.

266
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:43,345
Oh, swell. Well,
so long, fellas.

267
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,520
So long. So long.

268
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,305
It was sure nice
knowin' all of you.

269
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,307
And-And give my
regards to the General.

270
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,483
Attention! At ease.

271
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:58,404
At ease, men.

272
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,275
Who is, uh, Corporal Allen?

273
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,711
I am, sir.

274
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,365
I want to congratulate you,
Corporal.

275
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,540
You and the rest of your cast

276
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,237
have turned out a
most successful show.

277
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:07,500
Thank you, sir.

278
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:11,460
And where is Private Dolan?

279
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:15,290
Well, uh, I don't believe
Private Dolan's on stage, sir.

280
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,206
The last I saw of him,
he was on his way off the post.

281
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,382
Oh, that's too bad. Yes, sir.

282
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,341
I wanted to congratulate
him personally.

283
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,907
Thank you, sir.

284
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,350
Well, Dolan, it appears you're as
much a clown off the stage as you are on.

285
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,525
Yeah.

286
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,222
Corporal. Yes, sir.

287
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:36,442
Tonight's show has convinced
me that Colonel Bradon is right.

288
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,791
These shows mean
a lot to the men.

289
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,009
Now, keep up the good work.

290
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:40,228
Yes, sir. Oh, but this show

291
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,925
will please the men in any army camp,
sir.

292
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:44,667
You know, in show business,
shows go from town to town.

293
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,582
Say, that's a brilliant idea,
Dolan.

294
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,192
- Lieutenant? - Yes, sir.

295
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,717
Detach this unit to tour the
other army camps in our area.

296
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,240
Yes, sir.

297
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:54,851
There may have to be a
few minor changes made, sir.

298
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,157
Oh, oh, don't be silly, Chick.

299
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,941
This show could play
just like you put it on.

300
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,595
What would you want
to make changes for?

301
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:01,380
He's right. It's perfect as is.

302
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,469
Don't change a thing. Now,
that's an order.

303
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,514
Yes, sir.

304
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:07,690
And since I'll be traveling around myself,
I'll see it several times.

305
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,431
Congratulations again, Corporal.

306
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,564
I'll be seeing you, Dolan. Oh,
thank you, General.

307
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,783
Uh, yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

308
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,744
Say,
you should use that routine in the show.

309
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,833
Uh, yeah, you could use that in a show,
huh, Chick.

310
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:22,009
Well, anytime the army
wants me to help out again, sir,

311
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,489
don't hesitate to call on me.

312
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,665
- I won't. - Attention!

313
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,711
Hey, he's a nice man.

314
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,542
Uh, w-well,
let me hear from you guys.

315
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,849
Drop me a post card sometime.

316
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:37,938
Now you've done it.
You and your big mouth.

317
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,114
"The men in the other
camps will like this show.

318
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:42,203
"Chick,
what do you want to make changes for?"

319
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:43,987
I was only tryin'
to get you in good.

320
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,424
You know what you've done?

321
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,035
You've cooked us all
including yourself.I have?

322
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,254
You were supposed to open on Broadway,
weren't you?

323
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,691
Well, your season just closed.

324
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:52,866
Oh, no!

325
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,042
This show goes on tour as is.

326
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,739
Oh, no!

327
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:59,394
And you'll go with it,
Private Dolan.

328
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,700
That's an order.

329
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,571
Oh, no!

330
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,617
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

331
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:09,273
Come on, fellas,
this is blackmail.

332
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,145
Th-This is kidnapping.

333
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:13,147
This is self-protection.

334
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,149
If I let you go now,
the whole story will get out

335
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,542
and we'll end up
in the hoosegow.

336
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:17,934
If you guys don't let me go,

337
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,415
I'll call an officer and
tell him the whole story.

338
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:25,638
I-I'll scream.

339
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:31,295
What happens if I do?

340
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,993
I'm glad you asked that.

341
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:35,299
Evans, uh, what's the penalty

342
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:38,085
for, uh,
wearing a uniform under false pretenses?

343
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,479
Oh,
they-they put you in jail for six months.

344
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,002
Well, that's not so tough.

345
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,221
And then they take
you out and shoot you.

346
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:47,355
Because you wore a uniform
to sneak into an army camp.

347
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:49,749
And that comes under
the heading of "Espionage."

348
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,664
You're a spy, see?

349
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,362
Espionage?

350
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,497
They shoot spies, don't they?

351
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:00,847
Naturally.

352
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,763
But usually,
the first volley of shots does the trick.

353
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,460
If they don't hit a vital spot,

354
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,636
they shoot until they do.

355
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,029
And you know that old motto,

356
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,987
"If at first you don't succeed,

357
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:13,033
- "you try and try again."
- "You try and try again."

358
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:14,904
Try again. I know.

359
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:18,691
I wonder, uh, are they supposed
to shoot for the head or the heart?

360
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,214
Oh, the heart.

361
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:22,085
That's so they don't
bleed so much.Oh!

362
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,565
All right, fellas.

363
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,437
If the execution is over,
can I go to bed?

364
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,091
I don't feel so good.

365
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,397
All right, come on.

366
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:33,227
Attention!

367
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,056
At ease, men.

368
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,536
This is Sergeant McClusky.

369
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,625
He'll be in charge of
this unit while it's on tour.

370
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,627
I've given him
full instructions.

371
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,455
Carry on, Sergeant. Yes, sir.

372
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,719
All right, men,
fall in at the foot of your bunks.

373
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,202
When you men volunteered
for the paratroops,

374
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:54,944
you knew you were entering
the toughest branch of the service.

375
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,729
The General has okayed the show,

376
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:59,558
but he wants your
training kept up.

377
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,256
Now, I know how it is when
you get a new sergeant.

378
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,433
You don't know what to
expect and it upsets you.

379
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,870
Well,
let me put your minds at ease.

380
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,873
Just to let you know
a little more about me,

381
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,788
I'm a louse!

382
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,878
Now, turn in, because tomorrow's
gonna be a very busy day.

383
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:17,619
Sergeant? Yes?

384
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,752
Aren't you gonna say good night?

385
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:22,798
I'll do that when I come
back to tuck you in.

386
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,931
All righty,
because it wouldn't be very nice of you

387
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,454
to go to bed mad at us.

388
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:29,588
Save the comedy for
the paying customers.

389
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,502
Well, if you don't like it,
break me.

390
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:32,895
Make me a civilian.

391
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,331
Turn in!

392
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,689
Boy,
what a break. A new sergeant,

393
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,473
and he thinks you're Dolan.

394
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,475
Well, if he thinks he's Dolan,
what does that make me?

395
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:48,781
Now, look, you have to lay low

396
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,957
until the General
sees this show again.

397
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,176
And you take his
bunk. Dogface's.

398
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,614
Oh, fine. It ain't bad enough
I got to give him my name.

399
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,267
Now,
I got to give him my bunk, too.

400
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,226
Pipe down in there!

401
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:01,228
Where am I gonna sleep?

402
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,099
Oh, you can have your bed.

403
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,361
I'll sleep outside.

404
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:05,972
The fresh air
will give me a lift.

405
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,584
Nice try, kid,
but you stay here.

406
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,674
What's the matter? Do I have to
come in there and shut you guys up?

407
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,894
Now, look,
we have to turn in. Take off your clothes.

408
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:15,982
Here?

409
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,811
Here in front of
all these fellows?

410
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:20,160
Take 'em off.

411
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,988
Well,
I'll take 'em off my own way.

412
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:27,733
I happen to like privacy.

413
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:40,876
You! You'll have
to get out of here.

414
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,923
Go on. Run along.

415
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:46,099
Outside. Shoo. Come on. Hurry.

416
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,317
Hoo!

417
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,786
Well,
some people are more modest than others.

418
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:09,791
Okay, now that you're all undressed,
turn in!

419
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,759
Hey, Dogface.

420
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,589
Here's the key
to the boiler room.

421
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,940
Now, go hide yourself.

422
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,593
There's-There's
no window in there.

423
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,030
If I can't breathe, I'll die.

424
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,945
Good,
then there'll only be one Dolan.

425
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,250
Yeah.

426
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:35,556
Go on. Beat it.

427
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:38,211
Oh, Chick, I'm scared.

428
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:40,169
Cheer up,
we're all in the same boat.

429
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,432
Yeah, but why does it have
to leak right under my seat?

430
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,173
Now, go to bed. I don't want to.

431
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,349
Why not? I'm not going to bed
till that Sergeant comes back

432
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:47,960
and tucks me in
like he promised.

433
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:54,053
I'll tuck you in. Hit it for 10.

434
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:55,228
What do you mean?

435
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:57,099
I said, hit it for 10 push-ups.

436
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:59,058
For what? For being naughty.

437
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,234
I wasn't naughty,
and I don't have to do it anyhow.

438
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,932
You don't? No,
because I don't know how to do it.

439
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,500
And-And,
if you want me to do it...Yes?

440
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:08,154
Well,
you'll have to show me how to do it.

441
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:10,199
Well,
come here and I'll show you.

442
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,331
Should I go with him?

443
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:12,854
I think it'd be nice. Go ahead.

444
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,551
All righty. Bye. Bye.

445
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:16,858
All right. Go ahead.

446
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:21,558
One, two, three.

447
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,519
You do it.

448
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:26,999
All right, how many did you do?

449
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,304
Three.

450
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:33,048
Four, five...

451
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,854
Oh!

452
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:59,031
What?

453
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,251
Wise guy.

454
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:17,005
Turn off the radio.

455
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:18,398
All right. Come on. Get up.

456
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,706
It's the middle of the night.

457
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,925
Come on, get up.

458
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,232
Okay, Allen, get your men up.

459
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:28,103
Good morning,
everybody. Come on.

460
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:30,584
Everybody out of bed.

461
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:33,065
Got a big day's work
ahead of us. Come on.

462
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:34,762
Hey, Kelsey, shake that guy.

463
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,851
He'll never get to
be sergeant that way.

464
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,592
Come on, now,
you bunch of debutantes.

465
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:40,463
This ain't the Plaza Hotel.

466
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:43,553
Here we go. Come
on. Everybody. Up.

467
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:49,429
Oh, a wise guy,
huh? A real smart guy.

468
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:56,088
You heard me.
Everybody up. Come on!

469
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:58,481
Let's go. Last one out's
a second lieutenant.

470
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,744
Come on,
children. Nap time is over.

471
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,485
Time for crackers and milk.

472
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,096
You down there, up.

473
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,620
On your feet. Rise and shine!

474
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,981
Everybody up!

475
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,045
Morning.

476
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:48,575
Well, Mr. Dolan,
you left a 5:30 call.

477
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:58,498
What are you,
one of these tough corporals or somethin'?

478
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,717
No,
I'm one of those tough sergeants.

479
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,284
What about it?

480
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,546
No, nothing.

481
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,548
I'm one of those
scared privates.

482
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:08,638
Okay, you guys.

483
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:10,553
This is still the army.

484
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:14,035
You have exactly four minutes
and 35 seconds for roll call.

485
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,994
That means uniform "C."

486
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,821
Now, hurry up and get
dressed. We got to go outside.

487
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:20,302
Every man has to answer
roll call to show that he's here.

488
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:22,652
But the man just saw us. You mean,
we have to go outside

489
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,133
to tell the man we're here when
he knows we're here? That's silly.

490
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:26,482
No, that's the army.

491
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:28,658
Now,
get into your jump boots and fatigues.

492
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:43,325
Yahoo!

493
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,374
- Army. - Yep.

494
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:52,900
Parade rest!

495
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:54,249
- Archdeacon. - Here!

496
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:55,468
- Baker. - Here!

497
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:56,556
- Benton. - Here!

498
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,731
- Chambers. - Here!

499
00:33:57,774 --> 00:33:58,819
- Dobie. - Here!

500
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,082
Dolan! Dolan!

501
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,301
Here! Here!

502
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:05,043
As you were. Dolan?

503
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,306
Here!

504
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:10,874
You! Front and center.

505
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,053
Not bad. Fall in.

506
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,446
You. No, you!

507
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:20,449
I said "Fall in," didn't I?

508
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:22,060
Yeah, but,
you didn't say what to fall into.

509
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,626
I'm looking.

510
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,193
Uh, still a clown, eh? Well,
it may take a little time,

511
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,673
but I'll knock it out of you.

512
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:28,936
Now, get back in line.

513
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:31,852
It's your fault.

514
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:34,115
Uh, you're slippin',
Corporal Allen.

515
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,595
I remember you when you were

516
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:37,597
one of the ten best-dressed
men in America.

517
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,120
I'm sorry, Sarge. I know,

518
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:40,904
trying to grab a
little extra shuteye.

519
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:43,385
But,
your sidekick here was right on the ball.

520
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,909
Next time,
try to shape up the way he did.

521
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:48,042
And that goes for
the rest of you men.

522
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,306
Fall in.

523
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,178
I said, "Fall in!"

524
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,441
Okay, okay,
but where's the hole?

525
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:59,053
All right, funny man,
get a shovel and dig one!

526
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,147
At ease, men.

527
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,671
We got riggers to
pack parachutes.

528
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,891
At the same time,
every man has to learn

529
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:12,936
to pack a chute himself.

530
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,462
So,
even if you've done this 100 times before,

531
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:19,552
today you're gonna do it again.

532
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,554
Okay, start packin'.

533
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:35,742
Hey, Chick? Chick? Chick?

534
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:37,091
Chick!

535
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,659
What do I do?

536
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:41,139
Make-believe you're
packin' and I'll fix it for you

537
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,097
when I'm through with mine. Now,
hurry up.

538
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:27,533
Cut it, will you? Cut it!

539
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,099
Oh!

540
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,334
Hurry up,
get them chutes folded.

541
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:55,430
Remember,
would you jump the chute you're folding?

542
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,519
You may have to.

543
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:14,449
Dolan, finished already?

544
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:16,669
Uh, yes-yes, sir. Uh...

545
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,324
This, I got to see.

546
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,939
Hmm.

547
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,593
Not bad at all.

548
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,117
Nice work, Corporal.

549
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,771
All chutes folded?

550
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:34,164
Uh, yes, sir. All except
that one under Chick's table.

551
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,254
Chick,
show that one to the Sergeant.

552
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:44,523
Well, Corporal,
what's that chute doing under your table?

553
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,220
I put it there, Sarge.

554
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,222
Can't fold a chute,
so you hide it

555
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,180
and let someone
else do it for you.

556
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:53,096
Well, I don't know what kind
of pull got you them stripes,

557
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,402
but I do know what kind of pull

558
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:55,751
is gonna take 'em away from you!

559
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,623
No, no, Sarge, that's my chute.

560
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:01,191
Don't try takin' up for your
buddy! It don't go with me.

561
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,323
I'm sorry, Chick.

562
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,803
What are you sorry about?

563
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,544
You done the right thing.

564
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:06,719
Hut!

565
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,469
At ease, men.

566
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:20,385
It's been decided to send
you on tour immediately.

567
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:22,343
I want you to go
back to the barracks,

568
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:25,128
and get ready to move out.

569
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:28,306
In 45 minutes,
you'll march over to the auditorium,

570
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,959
load your equipment on trucks,

571
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,918
and catch the train
for Camp Crutcher.

572
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,616
That's all, Sergeant.

573
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,750
All right, men,
turn in those chutes and start packing.

574
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,797
Uh, Sarge, can I help you?

575
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:44,104
You know,
I'm beginnin' to like you.

576
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:45,758
You are? Is that good?

577
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:48,674
Yeah, and I'm gonna
let you in on a little secret.

578
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:49,805
What?

579
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:52,155
I'm not half as
tough as I sound.

580
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:53,853
You're not?

581
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,985
Nah. It's just somethin'
that comes over me.

582
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:58,771
Sometimes I think I'm
my own worst enemy.

583
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,773
No, you're not, Sarge.

584
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:02,688
Not as long as I'm alive.

585
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:16,571
Hey, buddy,
if you think you can pull that on me,

586
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:19,008
you're per-perfectly welcome.

587
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:20,662
Y-Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

588
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:23,665
I-I-I'm sorry,
sir. Go right ahead. Help yourself, sir.

589
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,843
- Hi, fellas. - Hi.

590
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:29,628
Havin' a big time, huh? Yep.

591
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:31,760
Don't let him use too much
cream. He's got to drive.

592
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:34,633
All right. Thank you.

593
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,593
Just a minute,
son. How long have you been in the army?

594
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,160
Well,
I'm not exactly in... What?

595
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,770
Long enough to know better, sir.

596
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:44,164
Uh, I'm sorry, sir. Now,
if you'll excuse me...

597
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:45,687
Just a minute, young man.

598
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:47,472
You're a paratrooper now.

599
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:50,562
And discipline and military courtesy
mean more than they ever did.

600
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,564
Yeah, I know that,
sir. Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

601
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,392
And-And I'll watch it,
sir. And the next time...

602
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,176
There won't be any next time,
do you understand?

603
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:57,960
Oh, I do, sir. Yes,
sir.That's better.

604
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,658
Th-Thank you,
sir. All right, Lieutenant.

605
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:01,660
As you were. Yes,
thank you. Thank you, Lieutenant.

606
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:02,878
At ease. Yes, sir.

607
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:04,358
At ease. Yes, sir.

608
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,496
Wise guy.

609
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:17,676
Hello?

610
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,894
Hello, Betsy?

611
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:22,507
This is Hap. Happy
to hear from me?

612
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,291
I have to be very careful.

613
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:26,641
A captain just walked in.

614
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:30,123
Uh, this is Dolan. Uh,
Dogface Dolan.

615
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,255
Where did I ever
meet you before?

616
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:36,564
You know,
I'm a friend of Hap Smith's.

617
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:40,002
Hap, where are you?

618
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:42,265
And what do you mean calling
me in the middle of the night?

619
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:45,094
Middle of the night? It's 7:05.

620
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,400
Rise and shine.

621
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,923
What's this all about?

622
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:51,449
I-I can't tell you now,
Betsy. I can't tell you now,

623
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:54,408
but all I can tell you is I can't make
that appointment with Earl White.

624
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,279
You listen to me, Hap Smith.

625
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:59,152
You either be at Earl
White's office at 11:30 sharp

626
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:00,980
or this is the end of the act.

627
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:05,463
Oh, is that so?

628
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,421
Well, you listen to me,
young lady.

629
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,641
I'm gettin' pretty sick
and tired of your tantrums.

630
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:12,861
And from now on, I'm gonna be the
boss around here, you understand?

631
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:14,167
And furthermore...

632
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,603
Your party has been disconnected,
sir.

633
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:16,865
You keep out of this!

634
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,301
And get this straight.

635
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:20,042
You can't make a fool out of me.

636
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:22,131
Just what do you
think I am anyway?

637
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:24,873
I'm sorry, sir, but we're not
allowed to give out that information.

638
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:36,145
At ease, men. Keep your smokes.

639
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,715
It's 9:15.

640
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:45,851
The schedule says, "9:15,
instruction in hand-to-hand combat."

641
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:49,376
And train or no train,
we're gonna keep on schedule.

642
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,380
Williams.

643
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:56,165
Now, you're sneaking up on
an enemy sentry in the dark.

644
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:57,558
Where would you knife him?

645
00:41:58,298 --> 00:41:59,691
Under the ribs.

646
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:01,040
And before I take the knife out,

647
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,129
I'd give it a twist,
so it wouldn't get stuck.

648
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,392
That's wrong. Evans.

649
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:08,569
How would you do it?

650
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:09,831
Well, I'd... Ah!

651
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:13,966
Like this.

652
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:15,054
That's wrong.

653
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,927
You could hear him
gurgle 200 yards away.

654
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:21,190
Dolan.

655
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:29,068
Now,
the correct method is a down stroke

656
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:31,549
between the shoulder
blades and the backbone.

657
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:37,337
Sarge? Yes.

658
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,860
That's very interesting.

659
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:40,209
I'm glad you like it.

660
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:43,996
Dolan, where you going?

661
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:46,346
Oh, s-sometimes,
I don't hear so good.

662
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,174
No alibis, Dolan.

663
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:50,219
Supposing you were disarmed,

664
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:53,266
and some guy was ready
to put his bayonet in your gut.

665
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:56,617
Supposing he was comin' at you like this,
what would you do?

666
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:58,271
Well, I'd probably faint.

667
00:42:58,314 --> 00:42:59,402
That's right!

668
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:01,361
You'd feint him out of position.

669
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,058
Supposing that failed,

670
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:06,496
how would you parry the
thrust and take away his rifle?

671
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,585
Well...

672
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:15,636
That was absolutely perfect,
Dolan.

673
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,290
Absolutely perfect.

674
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:30,216
Who are you? Who are you?

675
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:32,610
Sarge. Sarge!

676
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:35,395
May I cut in?

677
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:43,229
Psst! Psst!

678
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:44,360
Hey, Chick.

679
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:45,448
What?

680
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:46,841
I'm hungry.

681
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:48,321
Now, wait a minute,
will you? Will you wait?

682
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:50,802
"Wait a minute." I'm so weak now,
I can hardly write.

683
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:52,891
- Give me somethin' to eat.
- Shh!

684
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,980
There you are,
gentlemen. I hope you enjoy it.

685
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:58,200
Thank you. Leave
some for the others.

686
00:43:58,244 --> 00:44:01,029
What do you mean,
"the others"? Ain't I one of the others?

687
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:03,118
I'm hungry.

688
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:04,250
You'll eat last.

689
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:05,381
Oh!

690
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:13,825
How come you're takin'
the little fella's sandwich?

691
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:16,697
This isn't his. This
belongs to everybody.

692
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:18,656
Do you mind? No.

693
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:29,579
Let him have it.

694
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:31,973
Do you mind if I have one?

695
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:33,975
Well... No, not at all.

696
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,116
Look, Dolan.

697
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,509
If you don't want me to have a sandwich,
say so.

698
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:48,294
Don't try to be funny.

699
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:50,862
I'm not tryin' to
be funny. Honest.

700
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:02,525
Well, as soon as we have somethin' to eat,
we'll do a little trainin'.

701
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,789
Nothing like keepin'
a fella in shape.

702
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,898
Two hands. One for each head.

703
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:31,598
You know, boy,
you're getting funnier to me all the time.

704
00:45:35,515 --> 00:45:36,559
Ow!

705
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:38,213
Ow!

706
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:43,741
What's that?

707
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:45,133
We used to belong
to Beaver Patrol.

708
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:47,005
That was our pack
call. Wanna join?

709
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,804
Move along, let's go there.

710
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:06,154
Snap it up!

711
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:10,028
All right, men, it'll be an hour

712
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:12,160
before the next train
leaves for Camp Crutcher.

713
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:14,554
Corporal Allen,
I got to make out my report.

714
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:16,251
I'm puttin' you in
charge until I get back.

715
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:17,992
Okay, Sarge.

716
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:20,038
You can send somebody to
Lindy's for coffee and sandwiches,

717
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:22,127
but nobody else leaves this spot,
understand?

718
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,432
I got you. You better,

719
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:25,695
because I'm making
you responsible.

720
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,436
I-I can go for the sandwiches,
Chick.

721
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,655
No, let me. I don't mind.

722
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:30,178
No,
I'll go get 'em. Will you wait a minute?

723
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:32,137
I think I ought to go. "Wait a minute,"
he said.

724
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,095
He wants I should
go for the sandwiches.

725
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:36,184
No,
not you. You're staying with me.

726
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:37,533
Why can't he go?

727
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:39,231
Why can't I go?

728
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:41,363
Well, I thought,
maybe he'd stay and keep me company.

729
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,104
He's my buddy.

730
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:45,063
Well, if I'm his buddy,
I should go for the sandwiches, huh?

731
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:46,760
Go ahead, get sandwiches.

732
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,980
But, Sarge... When I give an order,
it's an order!

733
00:46:49,023 --> 00:46:51,286
Get goin'.

734
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,593
Uh, thank you,
Sarge. Thank you very much.

735
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:55,551
Would you like, uh,
mustard or ketchup?

736
00:46:55,595 --> 00:46:57,379
Keep your eye on my duffel bag,
will you, Chick?

737
00:46:57,423 --> 00:46:59,512
I won't be ba... I mean,
I'll be back.

738
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:01,035
Thank you, Sarge.

739
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:07,912
Now,
why do you always pick on the little fella?

740
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:09,914
In my book,
he's the only one I'd trust

741
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:12,090
outside these station gates.

742
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:14,309
And I know men.

743
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,270
He knows men.

744
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:21,621
Yes, it's 11:35.

745
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,146
Better late than never.

746
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,150
Hap,
why didn't you tell me over the phone?

747
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:32,284
I couldn't tell you then,
but I'll explain now.Oh, you don't have to.

748
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,286
Oh, Hap,
I think it's just wonderful.

749
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:36,854
I don't want to interrupt
this touching scene,

750
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:39,726
but I'd like to know which
Sam is representing you?

751
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,162
Gilmore or Uncle?

752
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:43,643
Well, Uncle,
of course. He's a paratrooper. See?

753
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:45,166
And when did you
take basic training?

754
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,559
And when did your
bad ear get well?

755
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:48,300
And how come you're
not quarantined?

756
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:50,519
I didn't take any basic training
and I didn't get quarantined.

757
00:47:50,563 --> 00:47:53,000
I suppose all they did was
to slap a uniform on you

758
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:54,393
and say, "Okay,
you're a soldier."

759
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:56,134
That's exactly... Now,
see here, Mr. White,

760
00:47:56,177 --> 00:47:57,483
I don't like your tone.

761
00:47:57,526 --> 00:47:59,180
And I don't like
what's going on here.

762
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:00,573
But, Mr. White...

763
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:02,401
Hold up those Hap Smith contracts,
Miss Brady.

764
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:04,403
Now,
wait a minute! I'm gonna be in the show!

765
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:06,013
Oh, no, you're not.

766
00:48:06,057 --> 00:48:08,059
I refuse to let
you be a deserter.

767
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:09,625
I'm not gonna be a deserter.

768
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:12,411
Everybody's talkin' so fast,
I'm in a tizzy.

769
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:16,154
Now, if you'll just be quiet for a minute,
maybe I can explain.

770
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:18,286
I thought I'd find you here.

771
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,027
Why, Chick,
what are you doin' in town?

772
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,681
I'm doin' his booking
for the time being.

773
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:23,291
Now, come on,
we'll miss our train.

774
00:48:23,335 --> 00:48:25,163
Just a minute.

775
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:26,599
You can at least
let him say goodbye.

776
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:28,253
I don't wanna say goodbye.

777
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:31,256
Don't you know when you leave a lady,
it's polite to say goodbye?

778
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:33,867
And when you meet a lady,
it's customary to say hello.

779
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,303
I'm Chick Allen.

780
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:37,958
Hello. I'm Betsy Carver.

781
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:40,178
I've heard a lot about you,
Chick, and...

782
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:42,789
Well, I'm awfully glad that you
and Hap are in the same outfit.

783
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:45,879
So am I. I don't know what
we'd do without good old Hap.

784
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,490
Tell her how I became a
paratrooper in one easy lesson.

785
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:50,318
You will look after him,
won't you?

786
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:52,451
Won't let him out of
my sight for a minute.

787
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,583
He's like a brother to me.

788
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:56,368
I'd like to write to his sister,

789
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:58,065
let her know how he's doin'.

790
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:00,894
In fact, after General Timmons
sees Hap at Camp Crutcher,

791
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,375
you two may be able to
work in White's show, after all.

792
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:05,594
Do you think you could
get him a leave of absence?

793
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:07,379
I'll use my influence.

794
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:09,076
Meanwhile you and I will have
to keep in touch with each other.

795
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:11,252
Of course.

796
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:14,168
Well,
I'll go tell Mr. White. Goodbye.

797
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:15,256
Bye.

798
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,389
Bye, Hap.

799
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:19,043
I told you,
I don't wanna say goodbye,

800
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:20,566
and I don't wanna
go back to the camp.

801
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:22,263
And I don't want
any part of army life.

802
00:49:22,307 --> 00:49:24,222
Hap,
you don't know what you're saying.

803
00:49:24,265 --> 00:49:25,658
When you talk like that,
you sound like

804
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:28,182
you didn't belong
in that uniform.

805
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,880
That's exactly what
I'm tryin' to tell you!

806
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:33,318
Come on, Hap. There's a lot
of people waitin' to talk to you.

807
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:34,580
Well,
I don't wanna talk to them.

808
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:36,190
I hate people!

809
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,139
"The General was
unable to see the show.

810
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,184
"So I shall continue
to remain in hiding."

811
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,099
Hey,
I'm writing a letter to Betsy tonight.

812
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,492
You want me to
say hello for you?

813
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:29,320
No. Say goodbye from me to you.

814
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,712
Oh, now, look, Hap.

815
00:52:30,756 --> 00:52:32,192
When we were working together,

816
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:34,455
you never wanted to quit after every show,
did you?

817
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:36,849
No. Well,
we're still doing our act together.

818
00:52:36,892 --> 00:52:38,807
Only we're using
different wardrobe.

819
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:40,505
You're givin' a great show.

820
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:42,333
Oh, thank you so much, sir.

821
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:43,986
So glad you liked it, sir,

822
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,815
because, you see,
tonight I gave me farewell performance.

823
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:48,643
No, don't try and stop me, sir.

824
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,341
I should like to
make me final exit

825
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:52,430
while the applause is
still ringin' in me ears.

826
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:54,171
Now, look,
Hap... Don't say a word, sir.

827
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:56,782
Just close your eyes. And when
you open them, I shall be gone.

828
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:58,349
Oh, no. Oh, yes.

829
00:52:58,392 --> 00:52:59,480
You can't. Why?

830
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:00,742
Military security.

831
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:03,397
Can't hear you.
Don't want to. Leaving.

832
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:04,964
Staying.

833
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:18,847
Rip! Pull!

834
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:20,719
1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

835
00:53:20,762 --> 00:53:22,982
Recover. Next man.

836
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:24,723
Bend your knees.
Look straight ahead.

837
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:26,203
Lower your hands on the door.

838
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:27,813
Rip. Pull! Spring out.

839
00:53:27,856 --> 00:53:29,728
1,000, 2,000,
3,000... Put your feet together.

840
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:31,860
Bring your hands around the
end of the reserve. Around the end.

841
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:33,732
Around the end of
reserve. Sit on your chest.

842
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:36,082
That's the way.
Recover.Thank you.

843
00:53:37,562 --> 00:53:40,347
Men, as you know,
this tower is designed

844
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:42,262
to teach you the
proper body position

845
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,438
when exiting from the aircraft

846
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:48,268
and to give you the feel of the
opening shock of the parachute.

847
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,966
Now,
I know you guys have done this before,

848
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,055
so be sure you do it right

849
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:56,842
because I'll be waiting for
you at the other end of the ride.

850
00:53:58,191 --> 00:54:01,412
1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

851
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:15,208
I don't like it. I want
to go back down.

852
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,471
No,
no. There's only one way down.

853
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:18,646
This way.

854
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:24,173
This tower is to get
you guys used to a jerk,

855
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:26,219
a real big jerk.

856
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:30,049
Just remember, Dolan,
you've been given a little rubber ball.

857
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:32,312
Well,
it ain't to play catch with.

858
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,532
It's to test your coordination.

859
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:37,622
Just remember, you got to
hold onto it all through your fall.

860
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:38,884
'Cause if you drop it,

861
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:41,539
you got to do the
whole thing over again.

862
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:42,757
Oh.

863
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:45,064
Rest of the men,
normal procedure.

864
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:46,805
All right, Dolan.

865
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:49,329
I want to see that ball in your
hand when you get down here.

866
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:52,201
My heart ain't
in it. It's up here.

867
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:54,726
Sarge, we better have the
men sound off their names.

868
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,206
Hold it!

869
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:00,253
Well, that's me.

870
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,908
1,000, 2,000, 3,000. Look out!

871
00:55:02,951 --> 00:55:04,126
Chick!

872
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,607
Chick!

873
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:15,834
Oh-ho-ho!

874
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:21,230
You! Come here!

875
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:25,670
Huh?

876
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:28,281
What's the matter? Didn't
you hear me say hold it?

877
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,848
Huh? I mean, sure.

878
00:55:29,891 --> 00:55:31,937
Oh, I thought you said, "Dolan."

879
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,200
You'll have to do
it all over again.

880
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:35,767
Do it all over?

881
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,595
Yeah. You dropped the ball.

882
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:39,336
No, I didn't, Sarge. See?

883
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:41,816
Well, you're, uh...

884
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,079
You're clowning around,
but you come through like a trooper.

885
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:46,125
Oh,
yeah. I've been a trouper all my life.

886
00:55:46,168 --> 00:55:48,823
See, this ball is stuck to
my hand like it was glued.

887
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:50,956
Oh,
you don't have to do it over again.

888
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:54,089
Oh, thanks a lot,
Sarge. Thank you.

889
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:56,091
Thanks, Sergeant.

890
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:02,402
Everybody sound off

891
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:04,317
just as soon as you hit the
ground. What do you say?

892
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,145
Yeah!

893
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:08,756
Rigs are coming down.
You boys ready to rig 'em up?

894
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,063
So, all the jumpers,
get shoulder-to-shoulder.

895
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,108
Riggers,
get shoulder-to-shoulder with your jumpers.

896
00:56:13,152 --> 00:56:15,415
Let's move on these rigs,
on the double, and rig 'em up.

897
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:16,982
Now,
which army is coming in first?

898
00:56:19,027 --> 00:56:20,377
It's gonna be a close call.

899
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,161
We're gonna see
which one it's gonna be.

900
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,782
Oh, no!

901
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:36,349
Shape up, Dolan!

902
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,046
Come on now.

903
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:41,310
I'm not gonna do that.

904
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:42,790
Okay.

905
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:44,270
If it'll make you any happier,

906
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:45,880
you don't have to jump.

907
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:47,186
I don't have to jump?

908
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:48,579
You're not kidding me?

909
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:51,103
I guarantee it. After all,
I'm your chum.

910
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:53,018
My friend. Your pal.

911
00:56:53,061 --> 00:56:54,541
I don't have to jump.

912
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:57,370
I don't have to jump.

913
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:02,201
Quick time. March!

914
00:57:02,244 --> 00:57:03,768
Platoon, halt!

915
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:05,900
Right face!

916
00:57:06,814 --> 00:57:08,860
At ease.

917
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:11,123
Okay, Allen, you take on three.

918
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:13,038
Dolan, you come with me.

919
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:18,826
Hello.

920
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,135
Uh,
what are you fellas fussin' around about?

921
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,623
Oh, no,
you don't! I mean, I can't.

922
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:34,581
Chick said I didn't
have to jump.

923
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,801
That's right,
you don't have to jump.

924
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:39,586
This just takes you up,
then drops you.

925
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:41,414
Oh, fine.

926
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,764
Then I don't have to jump.

927
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:45,853
That's nice. See,
I don't have to jump.

928
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:48,900
This thing just takes
me up and drops me?

929
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:52,469
Chick! Let me down!

930
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:55,341
I'm scared. Chick!

931
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:57,909
Dolan, you're a card.

932
00:57:57,952 --> 00:58:00,781
Well,
what goes up must come down.

933
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:03,262
Chick!

934
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:04,785
It's so high.

935
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:08,136
Chick! You said I
didn't have to jump.

936
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:12,184
Ma!

937
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:18,451
Oh...

938
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:22,411
Ah...

939
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:25,502
Chick!

940
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,809
Ma! Ma!

941
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,637
Ma, help!

942
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:32,117
Oh, it's so high.

943
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:36,077
I'll be a good boy. I promise.

944
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:37,688
Let me down.

945
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:38,863
Sarge!

946
00:58:42,214 --> 00:58:44,738
Oh, I'm scared, Chick.

947
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:47,611
Chick! Please help me!

948
00:58:47,654 --> 00:58:49,482
Oh, please help me!

949
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:53,617
Oh, I'm scared, Chick!

950
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:56,837
Ma! Ma!

951
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:59,536
Chick! Oh, Chick!

952
00:59:12,157 --> 00:59:14,855
Where's Hap? Uh,
Dolan? Anyone see him land?

953
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:16,683
Hey, Dolan.

954
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:18,816
Chick! Chick!

955
00:59:20,687 --> 00:59:21,993
Chick!

956
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:23,995
Chick!

957
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,522
Uh...

958
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:33,221
Hey, I'm sorry, fellas.

959
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:36,094
I didn't ask to
become a corporal.

960
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:39,880
And I didn't ask Sergeant
McClusky to like me, either.

961
00:59:39,924 --> 00:59:41,534
And I certainly didn't
ask him to go out

962
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,971
and get me this 48-hour pass.

963
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:45,582
48-hour pass?

964
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:47,540
Oh,
you can't use that. You won't come back.

965
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,194
I-I-I'll say hello
to Betsy for you.

966
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:50,717
All right, men, cover the exits.

967
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,197
Cover the exits.

968
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,199
You aren't goin'
anyplace. Sit down.

969
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:56,244
Wait a minute.

970
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:57,898
I'm a corporal, remember?

971
00:59:57,942 --> 01:00:00,988
And a private is not supposed
to tell a corporal what to do.

972
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:15,263
Come on, fellas,
now stop foolin' around.

973
01:00:15,307 --> 01:00:17,396
I'm a corporal. Attention!

974
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:20,878
Come on, fellas.

975
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,315
Attention, fellas.

976
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:24,708
Attention!

977
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:27,798
Forward march! One,
two, three...

978
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:29,321
No. March.

979
01:00:29,364 --> 01:00:31,236
We're gonna march together.

980
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:32,541
All right? March.

981
01:00:32,585 --> 01:00:33,717
Attention.

982
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,806
Forward. Double-time. Here.

983
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:38,373
One, two, three, four.

984
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:40,071
Come on, suck in those stomachs.

985
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:41,289
Stick out the chest.

986
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,943
That's it. Here we go!

987
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:45,380
Marching along together.

988
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:48,470
One, two, three, four.

989
01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:50,690
Oh, you fellas don't play fair.

990
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:51,952
Knock it off.

991
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:53,650
Well,
at least he paid me some attention.

992
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,347
All right. Give me the pass.No.

993
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:56,740
Give me the pass. Oh, no.

994
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:58,132
Give me the pass!

995
01:01:09,056 --> 01:01:10,667
Did you have a nice trip?

996
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:40,131
Come on,
gang. Lengthen it out there.

997
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,743
After him!

998
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,963
- Out the back way! - After him!

999
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:01,369
Come on, Kelsey!

1000
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,987
Wait a minute.

1001
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:13,164
Go get your hats.

1002
01:02:30,485 --> 01:02:32,313
Any time a patient's
to be operated on,

1003
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,488
don't leave him in the hall.

1004
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:34,751
But I... No arguments.

1005
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,970
Get him to the operating room.

1006
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,363
No visitors. Out.

1007
01:02:38,406 --> 01:02:40,017
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1008
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:05,216
What's goin' on here?

1009
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:07,740
Oh, oh, nothing, Sarge.

1010
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,437
I just stopped in
for a Band-Aid.

1011
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:11,222
You'll miss your
train if you don't hurry.

1012
01:03:11,265 --> 01:03:13,006
Come on,
I'll give you a lift to the station.

1013
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,444
Oh, fine. Thanks, Sarge. 'Cause
I wouldn't want to miss my train.

1014
01:03:16,488 --> 01:03:18,359
These fellows
don't have their hats.

1015
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:19,708
Go get your hats.

1016
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,058
Okay, Sarge.

1017
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:22,146
Yes, Sarge.

1018
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,149
Shall we go?

1019
01:03:46,779 --> 01:03:48,912
Hey, buddy, you got a match?

1020
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:51,305
Hello, Chick.

1021
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:53,394
I've been lookin'
all over for you.

1022
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:55,440
Where do you keep
disappearing to?

1023
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:58,008
Look how far I had to
come this time to find you.

1024
01:03:58,051 --> 01:03:59,705
Oh, sure, sure.

1025
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:01,925
You know, if I hadn't won
myself a pass in a fast crap game,

1026
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:03,840
you wouldn't have
found me at all.

1027
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:05,929
And that would've been
more than I could bear.

1028
01:04:05,972 --> 01:04:07,931
How did you find me so fast?

1029
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:10,629
I knew you'd run
right straight to Betsy.

1030
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:13,371
Oh, sure, but I was gonna
tell her all about you, Chick.

1031
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:14,807
Oh, that's fine.

1032
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,374
Now,
when you're through doin' this,

1033
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:18,811
you and I will go
back to camp together.

1034
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,421
And in the meantime,
I won't let you

1035
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:22,423
out of my sight for one minute.

1036
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,643
'Cause I don't trust you! Now,
come on!

1037
01:04:28,473 --> 01:04:29,517
Where we goin'?

1038
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:30,910
Servicemen's Center.

1039
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,172
What we goin' there for?

1040
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:34,435
That's where Betsy is.
She runs a show there.

1041
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:40,833
Uh, Chick, you know,
I don't want to spoil it for you two kids.

1042
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,096
I mean... Well, you know,
three is a crowd.

1043
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,533
I thought maybe I could
meet you someplace later,

1044
01:04:45,577 --> 01:04:47,274
like maybe Denver.

1045
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:49,233
Okay? I'll see you.

1046
01:04:54,847 --> 01:04:56,196
Did you have a nice trip?

1047
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,981
Why didn't you
write? I was busy.

1048
01:05:20,394 --> 01:05:21,918
Hi. Hi.

1049
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:24,833
What outfit you with, soldier?

1050
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,706
Pretty good outfit.

1051
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,887
What's the matter,
you havin' trouble?

1052
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:36,758
Tough beard.

1053
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:39,674
Maybe you're usin' the
wrong kind of a razor.

1054
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:41,850
This is the only kind.

1055
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:44,114
Here, I'll show you.

1056
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:47,378
I've been usin' this
razor for 23 years.

1057
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:51,556
For the fastest, cleanest,
smoothest shave.

1058
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,775
You can't beat it.

1059
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:55,516
Now the neck. Lift the head.

1060
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,703
Ain't I seen you
somewhere before?

1061
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,357
I don't think so, Sarge.

1062
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:13,360
You got the kind of a
face a guy can't forget.

1063
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,580
Wait a minute.

1064
01:06:16,755 --> 01:06:18,104
The train.

1065
01:06:18,148 --> 01:06:20,324
The face on the train.

1066
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:21,978
Who are you?

1067
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:23,980
Come on! Who are you?

1068
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:27,548
What's your name, soldier?

1069
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:28,985
My name is...

1070
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:31,335
I can't remember.

1071
01:06:31,378 --> 01:06:33,772
Oh, no? Well,
maybe G2 will refresh your memory.

1072
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:36,253
Take charge,
you two. He's going to the guardhouse.

1073
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:37,906
Right, Sarge. Right, Sarge.

1074
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,125
Come along, you.

1075
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:41,258
Wait a minute!

1076
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:45,827
What's this?

1077
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:47,742
Oh,
those are just notes for my book.

1078
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,657
Oh, yeah?

1079
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:53,139
"Having learned all there was to
know about the 105 millimeter gun,

1080
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:56,403
"I had myself transferred
to the paratroops."

1081
01:06:56,447 --> 01:06:57,796
This guy is a spy.

1082
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:01,017
I'm no spy, Sarge! I'm...

1083
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,714
I don't remember a thing.

1084
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:04,759
You will when we
get through with you.

1085
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:05,847
Come on!

1086
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:09,590
We got to locate Chick
and tell him right away.

1087
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,288
Let's go!

1088
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:13,377
Come on, you dirty spy!

1089
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,769
I'm no spy.

1090
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:17,207
Where were you born?

1091
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,338
Nebraska.

1092
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:19,992
What part? All of me.

1093
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,559
Your age.

1094
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:22,908
Twenty-four.

1095
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:24,475
Your name? Do...

1096
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:26,738
Don't remember.

1097
01:07:37,183 --> 01:07:39,185
Don't throw away
the stub coupons.

1098
01:07:39,229 --> 01:07:40,795
You may be the lucky winner.

1099
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,742
Oh, darling,
this is just wonderful.

1100
01:08:57,785 --> 01:08:59,570
Sure is. You know what? What?

1101
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:02,094
When this thing's all over
and we're out of uniform,

1102
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,053
we're gonna form a new act. Just you,
Hap and me.

1103
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:06,185
The three of us?

1104
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:08,405
The three of us.
Partners all the way.

1105
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:09,841
In everything?

1106
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:11,147
Except when we say good night.

1107
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:13,584
Then it's just the two of us,
you and me.

1108
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:15,412
That'll be much better.

1109
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,164
What are you in for?

1110
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:31,602
You don't have to
talk if you don't wanna.

1111
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,869
Well? Wasn't there, either.

1112
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:39,827
Did you try
O'Hoolihan's Bar?Yep.

1113
01:09:39,871 --> 01:09:41,394
Dirty Frankie's? Yep.

1114
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:43,831
The Stork Club? Ye... Now, look.

1115
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,094
We got to find him
before he brings Hap back.

1116
01:09:46,138 --> 01:09:48,749
There's still only room
for one Dogface Dolan.

1117
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:50,186
Yeah, you're right.

1118
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:55,016
Hey,
you there! Turn down that radio!

1119
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,801
Radio? What's that?

1120
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,111
Attention, everybody.

1121
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:05,549
Hey, Kelsey, look who's on TV.

1122
01:10:05,592 --> 01:10:07,464
Tonight we have two
young paratroopers

1123
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:08,813
that are going to entertain us.

1124
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:10,206
So let's give them a big hand.

1125
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,033
Servicemen's Center.

1126
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:24,497
Oh, you were wonderful,
both of you.

1127
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,893
I thought you said both of us.

1128
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,982
Oh!

1129
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:33,158
Oh, thanks a heap.

1130
01:11:33,201 --> 01:11:35,160
Uh,
which one of you is Private Allen?

1131
01:11:35,203 --> 01:11:37,293
I am. There's a
telephone call for you.

1132
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:38,946
They say it's very important.

1133
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:40,165
Oh, thanks.

1134
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,559
Excuse me.

1135
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:45,213
I think you're just
terribly amusing.

1136
01:11:45,257 --> 01:11:46,432
Uh-oh.

1137
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:48,304
You're cute.

1138
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:50,001
You're not so bad yourself.

1139
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:54,310
I hope you're the
lucky winner tonight.

1140
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,096
Mmm.

1141
01:11:58,139 --> 01:12:00,533
"1777."

1142
01:12:00,577 --> 01:12:03,319
What a perfectly
darling little old number.

1143
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:04,494
Hmm.

1144
01:12:10,717 --> 01:12:12,110
I'll think of something.

1145
01:12:22,468 --> 01:12:24,862
Excuse me. But I've got
to talk to Hap right away.

1146
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:26,124
Come on. Oh!

1147
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,475
They got Dogface.

1148
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:31,129
They got Dogface?

1149
01:12:31,172 --> 01:12:33,958
Now, listen,
don't get excited. It's really very simple.

1150
01:12:34,001 --> 01:12:37,178
First thing you do is get out
of this uniform. Beat it. Get lost.

1151
01:12:37,222 --> 01:12:40,094
Forget the whole thing ever happened,
you understand?

1152
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:42,923
Now, listen to me.

1153
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:45,491
If I'm lucky... Yeah?

1154
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:48,712
...maybe they'll only
give me 30 or 40 years

1155
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,540
in Alcatraz.

1156
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:53,238
Thirty or 40 years?

1157
01:12:54,718 --> 01:12:55,980
Hap? Huh?

1158
01:12:57,068 --> 01:12:58,896
This is it.

1159
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:02,203
Chick, t-this is what?

1160
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:03,422
This is it.

1161
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:05,206
Whoa.

1162
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:09,123
Well, Chick,
I-I-I only have one thing to say.

1163
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,473
What is it, pal?

1164
01:13:11,038 --> 01:13:12,257
Bye!

1165
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,830
Hey, soldier!

1166
01:13:24,878 --> 01:13:26,402
Quiet!

1167
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:28,273
Quiet, everybody.

1168
01:13:28,316 --> 01:13:31,145
As you know, each week our
sponsors donate their products

1169
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:33,017
to some lucky
person in the service.

1170
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,932
So look closely at your stubs

1171
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,543
and you may be the
fortunate winner. Julie.

1172
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:40,285
The lucky ticket
tonight is 17...

1173
01:13:40,807 --> 01:13:42,940
1777.

1174
01:13:42,983 --> 01:13:45,203
The winner. Here he is.

1175
01:13:46,596 --> 01:13:48,772
I didn't do nothing,
fellas! I'm innocent!

1176
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:50,774
Oh, I knew you'd win!

1177
01:13:52,123 --> 01:13:53,820
Well?

1178
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:56,040
It's very confusing, sir. His
fingerprints check with the records.

1179
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:58,085
And Lieutenant Green
knows him as Private Dolan,

1180
01:13:58,129 --> 01:13:59,435
a regular member of the company.

1181
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:00,871
Well, then, why the confusion?

1182
01:14:00,914 --> 01:14:03,351
Sergeant McClusky insists
he never saw the man before

1183
01:14:03,395 --> 01:14:05,789
except possibly for a
brief instant on the train.

1184
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:08,400
Perhaps we'd better have
a talk with the other Dolan.

1185
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,489
Sir, this report just came in.

1186
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:16,887
Gentlemen,
here's what we've been waiting for.

1187
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,323
This command will move tomorrow

1188
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:20,107
for combined maneuvers
under the corps command.

1189
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:22,196
Yes,
sir. Put Dolan under heavy guard.

1190
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,937
I'm afraid we'll have
to let his case wait.

1191
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,809
Right. We're going
to beat General Bond

1192
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:27,767
if it's the last
thing we ever do.

1193
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:29,595
Ted,
send down the word to all commands.

1194
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:31,510
And order all leaves and
passes canceled immediately.

1195
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:34,382
Right, sir. Sir.

1196
01:14:34,426 --> 01:14:37,560
And just the thing,
for any hour of the day or night,

1197
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,910
direct from the salons of Paris,

1198
01:14:39,953 --> 01:14:43,174
this exquisite
sheer silk negligee!

1199
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:51,051
Wrap it up. I'll take it.

1200
01:14:51,095 --> 01:14:53,097
And now, best of all...

1201
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,012
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but this is important.

1202
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:56,448
Oh, sure.

1203
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,450
"Attention,
all men of the airborne division.

1204
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,799
"Return immediately.

1205
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:02,585
"All passes and furloughs
are hereby canceled.

1206
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:06,153
"By order of Brigadier General
W.W. Timmons, commanding."

1207
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,853
Uh-oh. Oh, no, you don't.

1208
01:15:09,896 --> 01:15:11,202
Oh, no, you don't.

1209
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:13,073
The last prize
is the best of all.

1210
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:14,640
Oh,
all right. All right. What is it?

1211
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:16,990
Through the courtesy of
Jack Saper and Company,

1212
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:19,950
and in cooperation with the
New York City Police Department,

1213
01:15:19,993 --> 01:15:24,171
a police escort to the train that
takes you right back to camp.

1214
01:15:25,999 --> 01:15:27,348
Left face!

1215
01:15:28,349 --> 01:15:29,829
Forward march!

1216
01:15:36,923 --> 01:15:38,795
Hey, Chick!

1217
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:39,970
Bye!

1218
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:48,718
Yep, it's maneuvers, all right.

1219
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:50,720
Yeah, but I don't want to...Oh,
but it's okay.

1220
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:52,199
We'll get you lost somehow.

1221
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:53,505
Oh, what are we gonna do?

1222
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,028
There's nothin' to it.

1223
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:58,292
You get on a plane,
you go up 20,000 feet, jump out,

1224
01:15:58,336 --> 01:16:00,207
and the chute
opens automatically.

1225
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:02,079
Yeah, what if it doesn't open?

1226
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:04,560
Then you pull your
reserve parachute.

1227
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:06,344
Well, what if that doesn't open?

1228
01:16:06,387 --> 01:16:08,825
Well,
we haven't had a complaint yet

1229
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:10,914
from a guy whose
chute didn't open.

1230
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:14,961
Oh.

1231
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,268
All right, men.

1232
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:19,923
Start loading into your trucks.

1233
01:16:19,966 --> 01:16:23,317
Okay, Chick,
I'll be brave about it.

1234
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:25,711
I-I-I'll go up in
a plane.Attaboy.

1235
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:27,147
But I won't jump.

1236
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:28,409
Oh, yes, you will.

1237
01:16:28,453 --> 01:16:29,889
Oh, no, I won't.

1238
01:16:29,933 --> 01:16:31,151
Oh, yes, you will!

1239
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:32,675
Oh, no, I won't!

1240
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:36,461
Now what?

1241
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:37,897
Oh, I hurt my ankle.

1242
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:39,203
What's the matter, Dolan?

1243
01:16:39,246 --> 01:16:40,465
Ow. I hurt my ankle.

1244
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:41,771
Well, that's too bad.

1245
01:16:41,814 --> 01:16:43,816
But I'll jump just the same,
Sarge.

1246
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,297
No,
you won't. I'm not gonna take the chance

1247
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,604
of anything happening
to one of my best men.

1248
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:50,040
Oh, thank you, Sarge.

1249
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,519
I'll tell you what.

1250
01:16:51,563 --> 01:16:53,565
You go over to the DZ and
meet the recovery detail,

1251
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,219
and help them bring
the chutes back.

1252
01:16:55,262 --> 01:16:57,830
That is,
if the ankle doesn't feel too badly.

1253
01:16:57,874 --> 01:17:00,006
Oh, don't worry about me, Sarge.

1254
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,268
I'll make it all right.

1255
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:02,443
Good.

1256
01:17:04,184 --> 01:17:06,056
I told you I wouldn't
have to jump.

1257
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:08,058
Sarge! Sarge!

1258
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:11,061
Yeah? Uh,
but you will let me jump tomorrow?

1259
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:12,323
We'll see.

1260
01:17:12,366 --> 01:17:14,542
It all depends on
how the ankle is.

1261
01:17:14,586 --> 01:17:15,935
Oh, thank you, Sarge.

1262
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:08,379
Hey, what's the matter with Hap?
He's goin' in the wrong direction.

1263
01:18:08,422 --> 01:18:10,816
Let him go. The further away he
is from McClusky and the army,

1264
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,731
the better off he is.

1265
01:18:12,775 --> 01:18:14,515
Yeah, but he's going toward the
enemy lines. They'll take him prisoner.

1266
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:17,997
Look, with his brains, it'll just be
a short time before he's captured.

1267
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:21,087
Has he had the extensive
training we've had? No.

1268
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:24,569
He doesn't know the first thing
about combat, camouflage or patrolling.

1269
01:18:24,612 --> 01:18:25,831
How could he?

1270
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,180
They'll grab that poor kid

1271
01:18:27,224 --> 01:18:28,965
the first time he turns around.

1272
01:18:34,187 --> 01:18:36,320
Well, that was a short battle.

1273
01:18:38,104 --> 01:18:39,976
Move on, boys. Move on.

1274
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:57,167
Grab him!

1275
01:20:51,934 --> 01:20:53,109
Aah!

1276
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:01,987
Who's there?

1277
01:21:16,306 --> 01:21:17,655
Oh, no!

1278
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:19,352
Get going. Oh!

1279
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,145
Haw! Look who's a prisoner.

1280
01:21:29,188 --> 01:21:31,756
Well,
another one of Timmons' paratroopers.

1281
01:21:31,799 --> 01:21:33,453
What are you doin' here?

1282
01:21:33,497 --> 01:21:35,673
I'm a war correspondent for the
Weehawken Daily Messenger.

1283
01:21:35,716 --> 01:21:36,848
What do you think
I'm doin' here?

1284
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,154
Get in there with the others.

1285
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:40,069
Take these men to the stockades.

1286
01:21:40,112 --> 01:21:41,722
You and you, come with me.

1287
01:21:41,766 --> 01:21:45,204
All right, you Joes, let's go. Come on,
move out. Move out.

1288
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:52,516
Hey, soldier,
can't you let me go?

1289
01:21:52,559 --> 01:21:54,431
I won't go back to my side.

1290
01:21:54,474 --> 01:21:56,955
Are you crazy,
or do you think I am?

1291
01:21:56,999 --> 01:21:59,610
Oh, go ahead,
let the kid go. I won't tell.

1292
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:02,787
Get goin' and put your
hands on your heads.

1293
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,223
Oh, Chick, what am I gonna do?

1294
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:06,486
Oh, let me go, will you?

1295
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,140
Oh, here's your gun.

1296
01:22:08,184 --> 01:22:10,447
Hey, that was quick work,
Corporal.Oh, thank you.

1297
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:11,665
What do we do with this guy?

1298
01:22:11,709 --> 01:22:14,320
Uh, well,
tie him up and do away with him.

1299
01:22:14,364 --> 01:22:15,756
Anything you say, Corporal.

1300
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:16,888
Thank you.

1301
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,411
Now's your chance to take off.

1302
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:20,152
Huh? Take off.

1303
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:22,633
Oh, yeah. Well,
which way is our side?

1304
01:22:22,676 --> 01:22:24,548
That way. I'm goin' this way.

1305
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:27,290
No, Corporal. It's no good if
you're captured by the enemy.

1306
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,857
Listen, these paratroops know
how to operate behind enemy lines.

1307
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:31,859
We better stick with this
guy or we're dead pigeons.

1308
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:34,210
That might be all right with you guys,
but we're headin' down that road.

1309
01:22:34,253 --> 01:22:36,255
That's what you think, Private.

1310
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:38,649
Unless you got a lot more rank than
you're showin', you better come with us.

1311
01:22:38,692 --> 01:22:39,998
Yeah, but he's not even a...

1312
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,347
Not even what?

1313
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:43,871
Nothin'.

1314
01:22:43,915 --> 01:22:45,612
He didn't say nothin'.
That's better. Let's go.

1315
01:22:45,656 --> 01:22:47,440
And remember, he's in charge.

1316
01:22:47,484 --> 01:22:49,573
I'm in charge.

1317
01:22:49,616 --> 01:22:52,315
Okay, this way, men. Onward.

1318
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:56,275
You know,
I think we've built ourselves a monster.

1319
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:58,060
Well, I think you're right.

1320
01:23:01,846 --> 01:23:03,979
General Bond,
sir. Word has been received

1321
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:06,764
that our tank battalion is
approaching the Rock River.

1322
01:23:06,807 --> 01:23:09,941
Head of column should be
at the bridge by 11:50, sir.

1323
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,899
That's what I
call perfect timing.

1324
01:23:11,943 --> 01:23:14,032
Before the day's over,
we'll have old man Timmons

1325
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:16,121
and his paratroops
run right out of the state.

1326
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:17,470
Yes, sir.

1327
01:23:23,085 --> 01:23:24,695
Ooh! Ooh!

1328
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:27,263
Psst! Psst! Psst!

1329
01:23:27,306 --> 01:23:29,743
We'd make much better
time if we had that car.

1330
01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:31,049
How you gonna get it?

1331
01:23:31,093 --> 01:23:33,182
Ha-ha. You think
I'm gonna tell you?

1332
01:23:33,225 --> 01:23:34,618
The purpose of these maneuvers

1333
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:36,402
are to make you men
think for yourselves.

1334
01:23:36,446 --> 01:23:38,143
How would you get it?

1335
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:40,928
Go behind the tent, create a diversion,
then you get the jeep.

1336
01:23:40,972 --> 01:23:42,582
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1337
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:44,280
Go ahead, create a diversion.

1338
01:23:44,845 --> 01:23:46,151
Go ahead.

1339
01:23:50,373 --> 01:23:53,289
Call my driver. I'm gonna join
Colonel Jackson at Rock River bridge.

1340
01:23:53,332 --> 01:23:55,204
I wanna be with the column
when they surprise Timmons.

1341
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:56,596
Yes, sir. Driver!

1342
01:24:02,994 --> 01:24:05,779
Let's go!

1343
01:24:05,823 --> 01:24:08,086
All right, men,
spread out to the left.

1344
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:30,674
Hey,
I thought I got rid of you guys.

1345
01:24:30,717 --> 01:24:32,502
Oh, well, I'm off to town.

1346
01:24:32,545 --> 01:24:33,938
I hope you don't mind.

1347
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:35,157
I certainly do!

1348
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,159
Well, that's too bad about you.

1349
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:46,907
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1350
01:24:48,605 --> 01:24:50,520
Look out! Look
out! They'll hit us!

1351
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:01,618
Hey,
soldier! Bring back that vehicle!

1352
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:03,533
Yes, sir!

1353
01:25:07,885 --> 01:25:10,061
Yes, sir. What's wrong with you,
driver?

1354
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,628
Now,
take me to the Rock River bridge

1355
01:25:11,671 --> 01:25:13,412
and this time, stay on the road.

1356
01:25:13,456 --> 01:25:14,848
Yes, sir.

1357
01:25:25,207 --> 01:25:27,470
Give me that wheel!

1358
01:25:27,513 --> 01:25:31,778
Oh, no, no! Put it back,
you birdbrain.

1359
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:33,215
Stop this car.

1360
01:25:59,415 --> 01:26:00,720
He's down there, sir.

1361
01:26:00,764 --> 01:26:02,113
Come out of there!

1362
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,071
Come out of there.
You're captured.

1363
01:26:04,115 --> 01:26:06,291
Hold it. What's
in that bag there?

1364
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:07,597
I don't know.

1365
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,253
Grenades.

1366
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,384
Grenades?

1367
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:19,217
Release that man.

1368
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:21,393
The way these grenades were placed,
they wrecked this bridge.

1369
01:26:21,437 --> 01:26:23,569
Your tank column can't cross,
General.

1370
01:26:23,613 --> 01:26:25,528
The bridge has been destroyed
by Timmons' paratroops.

1371
01:26:25,571 --> 01:26:27,878
Now, see here... I can't listen to you,
General.

1372
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:30,359
Theoretically,
you have been blown up, too.

1373
01:26:30,402 --> 01:26:33,710
Gee, I'm sorry, General.Oh!

1374
01:26:33,753 --> 01:26:36,103
Spoilsport! Spoilsport!

1375
01:26:36,147 --> 01:26:37,714
Say, he's a sore loser.

1376
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:39,759
I'll tell him. He's my father.

1377
01:26:40,586 --> 01:26:41,805
Your father?

1378
01:26:50,944 --> 01:26:53,208
How can I blow up a bridge

1379
01:26:53,251 --> 01:26:55,035
with a grenade
that don't go off?

1380
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,237
Blowing up the bridge won the
victory for General Timmons' forces.

1381
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,716
So you men are being released.

1382
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,155
Now what?

1383
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:29,679
I caught him goin'
the wrong way.

1384
01:27:29,722 --> 01:27:31,376
Well,
he didn't know maneuvers were over.

1385
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,638
I didn't know.

1386
01:27:32,682 --> 01:27:34,074
He was still lookin'
for the enemy.

1387
01:27:34,118 --> 01:27:36,076
Oh, he didn't know. He was lost.

1388
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,862
And I suppose he thought he'd
find them at the railroad station.

1389
01:27:38,905 --> 01:27:40,080
The wha...

1390
01:27:40,124 --> 01:27:41,647
Attention! At ease.

1391
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:44,563
Is the soldier who took
General Bond's jeep, here?

1392
01:27:46,478 --> 01:27:48,088
Me.

1393
01:27:48,132 --> 01:27:49,960
General Timmons
wants to see you.

1394
01:27:50,003 --> 01:27:51,440
Oh, this is it.

1395
01:27:55,922 --> 01:27:57,707
Here's the man you've been looking for,
General.

1396
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,578
That's all, Captain.

1397
01:27:59,622 --> 01:28:02,668
Come in. Come in, Corporal.

1398
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:05,410
So you're the man who stole
the car and blew up the bridge.

1399
01:28:05,454 --> 01:28:07,107
Oh, y-yes, sir, but-but I'd like

1400
01:28:07,151 --> 01:28:09,458
to make a clean breast of things,
sir.

1401
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:12,722
You-You see,
it all started the night of the army show.

1402
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:13,853
Your name is...

1403
01:28:13,897 --> 01:28:15,638
Well, you know me as Dolan, sir,

1404
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:17,727
but my real name is Smith,

1405
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:20,120
Hap Smith,
and I'm a nightclub entertainer.

1406
01:28:20,164 --> 01:28:21,600
I remember you.

1407
01:28:21,644 --> 01:28:23,950
Did you say your
name is not Dolan?

1408
01:28:23,994 --> 01:28:25,430
That's right, sir.

1409
01:28:25,474 --> 01:28:28,128
Uh,
the real Dolan's in the guardhouse.

1410
01:28:34,744 --> 01:28:37,703
Do you mean to say
you're not in the army at all?

1411
01:28:37,747 --> 01:28:40,967
They wouldn't take me, sir,
but I can hear very good now.

1412
01:28:41,011 --> 01:28:44,319
I think my ear popped
w-when I took that tower jump.

1413
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:45,755
Well, young man, as I see it,

1414
01:28:45,798 --> 01:28:48,410
you're either going to be
a corporal named Smith,

1415
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:52,414
whose daring heroism has given
me the last laugh on General Bond,

1416
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:54,329
or a civilian.

1417
01:28:54,372 --> 01:28:56,766
Make that condemned prisoner

1418
01:28:56,809 --> 01:29:00,291
who's about to eat his last
meal before going to the gallows.

1419
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,728
Now,
I leave the choice entirely up to you.

1420
01:29:02,772 --> 01:29:04,077
Which one are you?

1421
01:29:05,078 --> 01:29:06,515
Let me see.

1422
01:29:06,558 --> 01:29:07,864
Come on.

1423
01:29:07,907 --> 01:29:10,475
Well, now that I'm A-one,
I mean, 1-A,

1424
01:29:10,519 --> 01:29:12,259
I'd like to stay with
the paratroopers

1425
01:29:12,303 --> 01:29:13,609
if it's all right with you, sir.

1426
01:29:13,652 --> 01:29:15,219
Oh,
I think that can be arranged.

1427
01:29:15,262 --> 01:29:18,265
After all, in the interests of
preserving military secrecy,

1428
01:29:18,309 --> 01:29:20,529
you should be sworn
in as soon as possible,

1429
01:29:20,572 --> 01:29:22,574
even if we have
to shoot you later.

1430
01:29:29,102 --> 01:29:30,582
Oh! Oh.

1431
01:29:41,288 --> 01:29:43,900
Don't be surprised if he
comes out a Brigadier General.

1432
01:29:45,249 --> 01:29:46,337
Could be.

1433
01:29:53,562 --> 01:29:57,479
From one through 16,
left to right, count off.

1434
01:30:03,876 --> 01:30:05,182
Sixteen.

1435
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:07,358
On your feet!

1436
01:30:10,361 --> 01:30:11,667
Face to your right!

1437
01:30:13,886 --> 01:30:15,322
And load out!

1438
01:31:32,748 --> 01:31:35,272
My ears feel like
they're gonna pop.

1439
01:31:35,315 --> 01:31:37,796
Well, we've been flyin'
at a pretty high altitude,

1440
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,885
but we're comin'
down now for the jump.

1441
01:31:39,929 --> 01:31:41,757
Good.

1442
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,890
I'm gonna wait till we're about
three feet from the ground.

1443
01:31:44,934 --> 01:31:46,936
Corporal Smith.

1444
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:48,720
It's about time you
started taking over

1445
01:31:48,764 --> 01:31:51,506
some of the
responsibilities now.

1446
01:31:51,549 --> 01:31:54,987
You're static jumpmaster
and you don't have to jump.

1447
01:31:55,814 --> 01:31:56,815
Right.

1448
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:02,778
Now, from here on in,
anything can happen.

1449
01:32:02,821 --> 01:32:05,824
All right, you men, get ready.

1450
01:32:07,783 --> 01:32:09,132
Stand up!

1451
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,787
Hook up!

1452
01:32:12,788 --> 01:32:14,529
Check your equipment.

1453
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:17,662
Now,
you guys have been in the game

1454
01:32:17,706 --> 01:32:20,056
long enough to know the routine.

1455
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:29,848
Stand in the door.

1456
01:32:31,023 --> 01:32:33,548
Don't be all day
about it. Get movin'!

1457
01:32:34,113 --> 01:32:35,201
Go!

1458
01:32:35,245 --> 01:32:37,247
1,000, 2,000...

1459
01:32:39,336 --> 01:32:42,382
1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

1460
01:32:46,299 --> 01:32:48,127
Chick, be my guest.

1461
01:32:48,171 --> 01:32:49,912
1,000...

1462
01:32:49,955 --> 01:32:52,088
Sorry I can't be
with you this time!

1463
01:33:06,145 --> 01:33:08,104
Hey, he hasn't any chute on!

1464
01:33:13,718 --> 01:33:15,590
Chick!

1465
01:33:18,767 --> 01:33:22,814
Ma! Ma! Ma!

1466
01:33:34,696 --> 01:33:35,958
What are you doin' up there?

1467
01:33:36,001 --> 01:33:37,524
What are you doin' down there?

1468
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:38,613
Come down here.

1469
01:33:38,656 --> 01:33:41,267
What? I said come down here.

1470
01:33:41,311 --> 01:33:42,617
All right.

1471
01:33:45,924 --> 01:33:47,491
Chick!

1472
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:50,146
Chick!

1473
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,715
Chick! Chick!

1474
01:33:53,758 --> 01:33:54,890
Come down here!

1475
01:33:54,933 --> 01:33:56,021
Chick!

1476
01:33:56,369 --> 01:33:57,501
Chick!

1477
01:34:02,854 --> 01:34:04,290
You do me a favor?

1478
01:34:04,334 --> 01:34:06,162
What? Let go.

1479
01:34:07,946 --> 01:34:10,122
Let go? Oh!

1480
01:34:15,737 --> 01:34:17,521
Oh! Hold on.

1481
01:34:20,393 --> 01:34:22,308
Chick! Chick!

1482
01:34:22,352 --> 01:34:24,006
Chick! Hold on!

1483
01:34:24,049 --> 01:34:26,399
Hold... Hold... Hold on!

1484
01:34:34,494 --> 01:34:36,801
Chick! Chick!

1485
01:34:36,845 --> 01:34:38,585
Oh, Chick! Chick!

1486
01:34:39,151 --> 01:34:40,370
Chick! Chick!

1487
01:34:47,769 --> 01:34:48,726
Chick!

1488
01:34:50,989 --> 01:34:52,034
Chick!

1489
01:35:03,436 --> 01:35:05,961
Chick, Chick,
I can't hold on no more.

1490
01:35:06,004 --> 01:35:07,397
All right, let go.

1491
01:35:12,445 --> 01:35:13,708
My chum.

1492
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:16,058
My friend. My pal.

1493
01:35:16,101 --> 01:35:18,756
After what we've been through,
nothing can separate us.

1494
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,844
That's right.

1495
01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:24,936
Chick! Chick!

1496
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:26,068
Bye!

1497
01:35:26,092 --> 01:35:29,092
