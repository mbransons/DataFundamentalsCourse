1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:59,399
Out of the sea

3
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:01,399
That once made her
Secure.

4
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:04,775
I have loved england,
And still as a stranger,

5
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,359
Here is my home,
And I still am alone.

6
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:13,527
One moment.

7
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,486
Come in.

8
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:24,655
I brought you
A cup of tea.

9
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,363
I thought
It might be welcome.

10
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,655
It is...

11
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,197
Very.

12
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:35,406
You really are
An angel, margaret.

13
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:37,907
Thank you.
What time is it?

14
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,365
Just on 4 a.m.

15
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:42,366
Really? Sit down,
Margaret.

16
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,867
Why don't you
Take your cap off

17
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:46,534
And lie down
For a while?

18
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:48,868
We were told
To stand by.

19
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,034
There must be some
Very good reason.

20
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,785
It helps to be
Doing something.

21
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:57,536
You're worried.

22
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,245
Who isn't nowadays?

23
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:04,413
I thought your son was to
Spend the week with you.

24
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:07,997
He phoned to say his
Leave had been canceled.

25
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,830
I haven't heard
Anything since.

26
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:11,831
It's been
5 days now.

27
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:13,914
I'm terribly
Worried.

28
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:16,373
So when we were told to
Stand by for emergency,

29
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:19,373
You made up your mind
He'd be in the thick of it.

30
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,583
Yes, margaret,
I'm afraid I did.

31
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,625
Well, you can be
Wrong, you know.

32
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,334
I hope you are.

33
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,251
Do try and rest.

34
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:13,261
0435.

35
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:16,261
Both motors cut.

36
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,559
Sit down, will you?

37
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,352
This is extremely
Confidential, susan.

38
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,144
I've been notified
By the surgeon general

39
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:59,145
To prepare for casualties
Within 24 hours.

40
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,187
He anticipates
A possible 5,000.

41
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,687
So many?

42
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:06,188
The matron tells me
We can take 300 here.

43
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,689
Can you have that number
Of extra beds ready?

44
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:11,689
If you allow us to use
The corridors, yes.

45
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:13,148
Yes, of course
You may.

46
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:15,689
I've had a talk
With the matron, too,

47
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,691
About nursing
And surgical facilities.

48
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:20,024
Will you see that your
Staff thoroughly understands

49
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,691
What will be
Expected of them?

50
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,233
Certainly.

51
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,400
Thank you.
That will be all.

52
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,527
I suppose I mustn't
Ask questions.

53
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,028
My dear, your guess
Is as good as mine.

54
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,278
Obviously
A big show somewhere.

55
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:40,195
Invasion?

56
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:44,279
No, hardly. A raid on
The french coast, perhaps.

57
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,197
On a big scale,
By the sound of it.

58
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:54,156
Is that...

59
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,656
Yes.

60
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,865
They usually
Start at dawn.

61
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:16,744
It's been a long day,
Margaret.

62
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:18,745
I never could have
Managed without you.

63
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:21,203
You sure you won't let me
Get you something to eat?

64
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:22,662
You haven't had
Very much today.

65
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:23,954
No, thanks.

66
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:26,830
Shall I open the window?
It seems a bit warm in here.

67
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:28,204
All right.
Thank you.

68
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,667
Strange, isn't it,
Margaret?

69
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,334
The way one's mind
Races about.

70
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,585
When one's happy...

71
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,085
When life's
Going along

72
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,086
In its normal,
Peaceful way,

73
00:06:57,128 --> 00:07:01,128
I don't suppose
We think very much-

74
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,088
Very deeply, anyway-

75
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,297
But in times like these,
We think. We wonder.

76
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:13,756
All sorts of thoughts have been
Going through my head all day.

77
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:15,423
I know.

78
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:20,591
When I first came from
America to england as a girl,

79
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:23,800
I was only going to
Stay two weeks...

80
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:28,093
And I've spent
My whole life here.

81
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:30,801
My whole life.

82
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:36,302
And I have a son
Out there somewhere.

83
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:43,595
A life is really a very,
Very long time, margaret,

84
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:47,304
When you look back
To when you were young.

85
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,681
Of course,
You wouldn't know that.

86
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,139
I will soon.

87
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,639
Good night,
Margaret.

88
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,307
Good night.

89
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,225
A very, very long time.

90
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:12,393
Strange to look back

91
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:14,060
To the day
So long ago-

92
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:16,560
The green sea
And the purple haze

93
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:21,062
And then, far off and low,
England.

94
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:25,063
I watched the long day start
On that gray shore,

95
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:29,022
A young girl with an open heart
At england's door.

96
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:32,022
I had no thought then
Of husband or lover.

97
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:35,023
I was a traveler,
The guest of a week,

98
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:38,482
Yet when they pointed
"the white cliffs of dover,"

99
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:42,816
Startled, I found there were
Tears on my cheek.

100
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,567
Sue, there are tears
In your eyes.

101
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,567
Ha ha!
Oh, are there?

102
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,568
It's just that
I'm so thrilled.

103
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,068
I've never
Traveled before,

104
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,985
And it's so wonderful to see
The things you've read about.

105
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,445
That coast is
Full of history-

106
00:08:58,528 --> 00:08:59,736
Our history.

107
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,237
Raleigh set out
From here to find

108
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:04,029
A new world
Called virginia,

109
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:05,488
And so did
The mayflower

110
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,946
With those english
Rebels

111
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,697
To find
A new england.

112
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:13,490
I suppose I sound
Like a schoolmarm,

113
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:14,989
But that's
Our background-

114
00:09:15,073 --> 00:09:16,489
That little green
Island.

115
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:18,824
Her past
Belongs to us,

116
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,450
Her history
And her glory.

117
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,491
The magna carta's
Ours

118
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:25,992
And milton
And shakespeare.

119
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:27,909
You think
I'm an idiot

120
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:29,409
Spilling over
Like this.

121
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,160
I think
You're wonderful.

122
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:33,202
I'm crazy
About you, sue.

123
00:09:33,244 --> 00:09:36,202
I haven't got a lot to offer,
But it's a good farm.

124
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:39,078
It's dad's, of course, but
It will be mine someday.

125
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,745
That's why I'm going
To scotland-

126
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,412
To buy cattle,
Improve the strain.

127
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:44,954
I'm looking for a bull
And some good heifers.

128
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:47,121
Going to bring them
Back with me-

129
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,621
In the hold,
Of course.

130
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:51,789
Oh, gosh, I say dumb things.
I'm not like this all the time.

131
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:54,748
It's just that I'm trying to
Make a good impression on you.

132
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,290
But you hardly know me,
Sam. Don't you think-

133
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:59,290
Oh, I know
It's kind of sudden,

134
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,291
But if you'll just think about
It. I won't see you in london.

135
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,250
Father, you stayed up after all.

136
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,459
Yes. I got talking
At the bar.

137
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:08,960
Where's this england
I hear so much about?

138
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,501
There she is.

139
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,501
Ah. Ha ha! Doesn't look
Much bigger

140
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:15,461
Than martha's vineyard
To me.

141
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:19,003
Always rains
In england.

142
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,212
That's what they say.

143
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:26,504
Hmm.

144
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:41,341
Good-bye, sue. I've
Got to catch my train.

145
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:42,466
Good-bye, sam.

146
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,008
You don't mind
If I write?

147
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,508
Of course not.
Good-bye.

148
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,551
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Dunn.

149
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,843
Oh, good-bye,
My boy. Good-bye.

150
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:52,010
Immigration, sir. Can I
Have your name, please?

151
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,469
Hiram p. Dunn.

152
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:54,969
The "p" is for...

153
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:56,928
Porter. That's
My mother's maiden name,

154
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,469
Since you're
So interested.

155
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:00,429
Thank you, sir.
Your age, please?

156
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,803
53.

157
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:02,971
Occupation?

158
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:05,096
I'm the publisher
Of the tolliver sun.

159
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:06,596
That's
A daily newspaper.

160
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:09,430
How long do you propose
To stay in england?

161
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:11,931
From april 2, 1914,
Until april 16, 1914-

162
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:13,931
That's exactly
Two weeks.

163
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,932
You've got adequate means of
Subsistence for this period?

164
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:18,891
Well, now, let me see.

165
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:22,933
I, uh-I have with me
Ł75 in cash

166
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,433
And a letter of credit

167
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,975
On the security
Trust company

168
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:27,433
Of providence,
Rhode island.

169
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:30,476
My bank balance
In the tolliver national bank

170
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:32,476
Is $1,742.07.

171
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,978
I have 3 bonds
In tolliver utilities,

172
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,478
Par value 3,000.

173
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,437
3 bonds in union pacific
Railroad fives 1932,

174
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,937
And 100 shares of united
States steel preferred.

175
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:45,438
Really, Mr. Dunn, this
Is hardly necessary.

176
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,604
I have
A fully paid-up policy

177
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:50,605
That will give me $60 weekly
At the age of 65.

178
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:51,939
Anything else?

179
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,232
What did I tell you?

180
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:05,567
It will be like this the
Whole time we're in england.

181
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,865
Suffering cats.

182
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:39,407
Well, there's no use
Making faces at me, susan.

183
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,408
The lady wants
The window open.

184
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:43,866
She likes cold air.

185
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,742
It's a national
Characteristic.

186
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:49,993
Doesn't matter if you and I
Here are frozen to the bone.

187
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:51,493
Doesn't matter
If my lumbago

188
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:53,910
Gets to start up
All over again.

189
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:56,327
No, sir. Give
An englishman a window,

190
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:58,661
And by heaven,
He's going to open it.

191
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,870
It might be he'll find
A nice, icy draft outside.

192
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,331
Oh! Ah...

193
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:17,332
Susan, you better
Go down to your dinner.

194
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,833
This food is bad enough
When it's hot.

195
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,791
Did you find out what time
The boat train leaves?

196
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:27,334
Yes, 10 a.m.

197
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:29,835
Are you sure you'll be
Able to travel tomorrow?

198
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:32,335
Oh, I'm going to
Get out of this

199
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:35,336
If they have to carry me
On board on a stretcher.

200
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,836
And, sue,
When we get back home,

201
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:41,837
Don't you ever dare give
Me another boiled potato.

202
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,879
And what in heaven's name
Is that?

203
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:47,338
It's suet pudding.
You put syrup on it

204
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,339
And eat it
For dessert.

205
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:50,797
Do they eat it?

206
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,339
I've seen them.

207
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:53,798
What a people!

208
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,965
You've got to
Hand it to them.

209
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,757
They've certainly got
Intestinal fortitude.

210
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,299
No, no, please.

211
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:01,758
Take this stuff
Out of my sight.

212
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,759
Whew! What an article I'm
Going to write for the paper

213
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:08,926
When I get home
On my trip to england.

214
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,636
You mean to tell me
You came 3,000 miles

215
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,636
To spend two weeks
In the bedroom

216
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,136
Of a bloomsbury
Boarding house?

217
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,470
Well, I'm afraid so.

218
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:21,304
My dear child,
You must stay over.

219
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:22,804
You must see something of england.

220
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:24,429
I've seen
A good deal of london.

221
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:26,805
I've seen the british museum and
The national portrait gallery.

222
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,805
Great heavens!
Ha ha ha!

223
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,305
No, thank you.

224
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:31,805
No, thank you!

225
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,305
British museum, eh?

226
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:34,806
You saw
The mummies, eh?

227
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,598
Been to any shows,
Any dances?

228
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:40,099
No.

229
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:44,058
Speaking of dances, I'm afraid
I can't play cards tonight.

230
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:47,726
It's the night of millicent
Waverly's ball, and, uh...

231
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,934
I thought I'd like
To go this time.

232
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:52,268
I hear the king
And queen are going.

233
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:54,727
Have you received your
Invitation, colonel?

234
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,686
No, by jove,
I haven't.

235
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:59,645
Oh, I must give
Millicent a ring.

236
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:02,729
Do you care to come to that
Shindig with me tonight?

237
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:05,230
I don't know whether that
Sort of thing interests you,

238
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:08,647
But everybody will be
There from the king down.

239
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,647
Oh, I'd adore it...

240
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,231
If father
Doesn't mind.

241
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:13,731
Shall I ask him?

242
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:17,232
Would you? He'd love to see
Someone. He's been so lonesome.

243
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:18,857
Is that so?

244
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,315
Does he play cards?

245
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,358
No, not much,
But he loves chess.

246
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,150
Does he? Ha ha! I used
To be pretty good at that,

247
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,150
And I've got some chessmen here, too.

248
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,651
You have?

249
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,110
A sort of heirloom. Very
Well, then, I'll venture in.

250
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:32,609
May I be excused?

251
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:33,944
Certainly.

252
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:36,444
Isn't that wonderful?
A real ball.

253
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:39,319
Oh, it's so different,
So english.

254
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:42,237
It's like a victorian
Novel come to life.

255
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,737
Oh, and I won't mind
Going home now.

256
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,947
I shall really have
Seen something.

257
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:56,907
I wouldn't count
On it too much.

258
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:58,365
I don't understand.

259
00:15:58,408 --> 00:16:00,866
Well, he's a very old man.
He has his fancies.

260
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,867
He's been with me
For 8 years,

261
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,325
And every year he tells me
He's going to this ball.

262
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,325
Perhaps
You don't know, dear,

263
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,242
But the duchess of waverly is the
Most exclusive hostess in london.

264
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,369
Oh, I hope you're not
Disappointed.

265
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:16,119
I'm dreadfully
Disappointed.

266
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:17,619
If you'll
Excuse me,

267
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:20,120
I'll see if my father wants anything.

268
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:21,620
Of course, my dear,

269
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:23,579
And you'll be busy
With your packing.

270
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:26,121
Too bad, isn't it? Such
A nice little thing.

271
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:27,663
Not a bit
Like an american.

272
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:29,247
No.

273
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,248
Not entirely new.

274
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,582
Oh?

275
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:38,248
If I'm not mistaken, blackburn
Introduced that variation

276
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,249
In the hastings
Tournament in '95.

277
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,749
Blackburn?

278
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,083
The british
Chess master.

279
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,625
Oh, you're wrong
There, colonel.

280
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,125
Pillsbury introduced
That move.

281
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,125
Are you sure?
Pillsbury?

282
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,668
Positive.
Paris, 1900.

283
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:52,168
Oh, pillsbury
In paris?

284
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:55,586
That's right. You can bet
Your bottom dollar on it.

285
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,086
Father, don't be
So cocksure.

286
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,586
It's hardly
Raining now.

287
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,128
I think I'll go out
And look at the shops.

288
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:02,628
Yeah, do that, dear.

289
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,796
Good idea. Get yourself a new bonnet.

290
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,463
Have a nice time,
You two,

291
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,630
And don't get
Into any arguments.

292
00:17:08,714 --> 00:17:10,339
Charming girl.
Yes.

293
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:12,881
It's refreshing to see
Someone young around.

294
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:15,256
These-these are very
Interesting pieces, colonel.

295
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,257
Where did you
Pick them up?

296
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:18,757
Oh, well,
A family heirloom.

297
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:19,924
Oh.

298
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,925
Yes, these pieces are
Over 100 years old.

299
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,425
Really?

300
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,550
Well, now, to follow up
The blackburn variation.

301
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,050
Pillsbury-

302
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:29,676
The american master
Pillsbury in paris, 1900.

303
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,718
I...

304
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Your daughter said
We were not to argue.

305
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,343
Otherwise-
Otherwise what?

306
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,803
I should point out

307
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,261
That this surprise move of a
Pawn is typically blackburn.

308
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:41,387
Blackburn is not the only chess
Player who can push a pawn around.

309
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,888
Well, perhaps we'd better
Get on with the game.

310
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:45,387
Yes,
Perhaps we had...

311
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,846
Though your position
Doesn't look any too good.

312
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,847
Huh! That remains
To be seen.

313
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:51,389
Well,
It's your move.

314
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:53,056
I'll prove it
To you later.

315
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,515
Prove what?

316
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:56,056
That this variation
Was introduced

317
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,556
By pillsbury
In paris.

318
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,016
Oh, to the devil
With pillsbury in paris.

319
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,558
Well, credit where
Credit is due, that's all.

320
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,058
Exactly, and I'm
Quite positive

321
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
The move originated in the
Hastings tournament in '95.

322
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:08,559
By blackburn, eh?

323
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,059
By blackburn,
Certainly.

324
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:11,518
The british
Chess master?

325
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,060
Quite.

326
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:15,227
Pillsbury was the
Chess master of america.

327
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,228
I'm quite aware
Of that, Mr. Dunn.

328
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:19,353
You're darn tooting
You're aware of it.

329
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:20,603
What do you mean?

330
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,228
You're saying that the
British master was superior

331
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:24,312
To the american master,
That's what you're saying.

332
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,730
Nothing of the sort.
It's a question of fact.

333
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,229
Harry nelson pillsbury

334
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:30,731
Could play rings around
Any english master anytime!

335
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:32,355
The english haven't
The knack for chess.

336
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,898
But the americans
Have, you mean?

337
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:38,399
That's right. Chess calls for
Ingenuity, enterprise, and skill.

338
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:40,941
Qualities which the english
Do not possess, you mean!

339
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,108
Well-

340
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,441
You go too far, sir!

341
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:45,067
No, no. Now,
Hold your horses!

342
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,067
It might interest you
To have a look

343
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:48,901
At this board
On which we're playing.

344
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,401
Dolly madison!

345
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:51,734
President madison's
Wife.

346
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,194
Where did you
Get this?

347
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,278
My grandfather
Picked it up in 1812.

348
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:56,694
1812?

349
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,194
When 6,000
British soldiers

350
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,653
Lacking in skill
And enterprise

351
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:01,362
Captured the city
Of washington,

352
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:03,154
The capital
Of the united states!

353
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:06,155
How did your grandfather
Get hold of this chess set?

354
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:08,321
By the simple act
Of taking it.

355
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:09,988
He was dining
In the mansion

356
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:12,530
From which your president
Had fled in some haste.

357
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,031
You mean
He stole it?

358
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:16,198
My grandfather was flag
Lieutenant under admiral cockburn.

359
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:18,490
The president's dinner was
Cooked and ready to serve.

360
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,032
The admiral and my grandfather ate it.

361
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,700
This-this is
Stolen property!

362
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,534
They're spoils
Of victory, sir!

363
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:26,033
Father! Father!
Father, please!

364
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,201
Why didn't you stay to
Protect your property?

365
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:30,368
Didn't figure you fellas would steal it.

366
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,868
Father, the colonel's
Your guest.

367
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,035
You ran like hares-
Like hares, sir!

368
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:36,160
The roads were littered
With the guns

369
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:37,828
Your men dropped
As they ran.

370
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,912
Well, now, colonel,
Probably we were just

371
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,912
Hurrying ourselves
Down to new orleans.

372
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,329
Bah! A deucedly
Disorderly rout, sir!

373
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:46,205
It seems to me, colonel,
That we won that war

374
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,579
Somewhere down
Around new orleans.

375
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:49,539
I think I'll just
Take this board

376
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,539
In the name of the
United states government.

377
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,706
Keep your hands off my
Property, you yankee rebel!

378
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:55,873
Yankee rebel! Do you
Hear that, sue?

379
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:57,248
Why, for two cents,
I'd-

380
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,374
You are a receiver
Of stolen property!

381
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,541
Ruffian!

382
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,708
Robber!

383
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,875
Barbarian!

384
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,041
Thief!

385
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:05,542
Father, you must
Apologize.

386
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:07,167
Well, I, uh...

387
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,710
Oh...

388
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:17,211
Oh, father.

389
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:22,754
Oh, I'm sorry, sue.

390
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:33,173
Gwennie, what the devil
Are you doing?

391
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:35,882
You've been racing up and down
Those stairs for the last hour.

392
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:37,382
I'm sorry, ma'am.
The colonel rang.

393
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:38,882
What does he want?

394
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:40,966
He wanted me to take a message to
Mr. Dunn. They've had a quarrel.

395
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,675
Then Mr. Dunn rang for me to
Carry an answer to the colonel.

396
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:47,509
He said he wouldn't take back a word to
Him, but as long as the colonel apologized-

397
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:49,009
That will do,
Gwennie.

398
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:51,176
We don't discuss
Our guests.

399
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,343
And then I was helping miss Dunn to
Dress, ma'am. She looks ever so pretty.

400
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:56,220
The colonel's
Taking her to the ball.

401
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:57,678
The ball?

402
00:20:57,762 --> 00:21:00,220
You don't mean
To say so.

403
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:02,054
Gwennie, wait.
Is the colonel dressing?

404
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:05,305
Oh, yes, ma'am. I had to take
His shoes up, cleaned special,

405
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:08,221
White tie and tails, ma'am,
And a ribbon around his neck.

406
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:11,931
Can it be true?

407
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:13,431
The duchess
Of waverly?

408
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:22,975
The duchess
Of waverly's motor

409
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:24,641
For colonel
Forsythe.

410
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,476
Yes, sir.
I'll tell him.

411
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,977
Well, don't stand there
Gaping, girl.

412
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:37,478
Run up and tell
The colonel.

413
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:39,186
Yes.

414
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:44,396
Here they come now.

415
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:54,356
The duchess has
Sent her motorcar.

416
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,898
She said she would.

417
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,565
Oh, my dear,
You look charming.

418
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,940
Thank you.

419
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,441
Indeed she does.
Ha ha!

420
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:01,941
I'm a proud man
Tonight.

421
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:03,608
Isn't it wonderful?
I'm so thrilled.

422
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,941
Have a good time.

423
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:06,609
Thank you so much.
Good night.

424
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:08,776
Good night.

425
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:31,864
Well, gives
Quite a tone

426
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:33,448
To the house,
Doesn't it?

427
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,907
One of our boarders
Gone off to see the king.

428
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:53,869
Why, walter,
This is nice.

429
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:55,327
You've been
Neglecting me.

430
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:56,869
No, no, no, no.

431
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:58,828
Miss susan Dunn
Of the united states.

432
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,870
My dear, I'm so glad you could come.

433
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,329
Nothing less would have
Brought this old bear out.

434
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:05,830
See that he finds you
Some acceptable partners.

435
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:07,996
Thank you. Is that the
Order of the garter?

436
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,538
Mm-hmm.

437
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,705
Instituted by edward iii
In the year 1348.

438
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,372
Oh, right,
I believe.

439
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:37,795
Are the king
And queen here?

440
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:39,337
No, no, they always
Come last.

441
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:40,712
Oh.

442
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,878
But there's the prime
Minister over there.

443
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,213
Where?

444
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:45,837
Right
By the orchestra,

445
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:48,339
And he's talking to
Your ambassador, by jove.

446
00:23:48,422 --> 00:23:50,714
Oh, that makes me
Feel lots better.

447
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:52,173
Better?

448
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:53,797
Braver.
Not-not so mousy.

449
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,423
Oh, young lady,
I'm the one

450
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,757
That's got to call
Upon his courage.

451
00:23:57,841 --> 00:23:59,799
May I have
The audacity?

452
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:03,467
Ha ha! It will be a very great pleasure.

453
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:31,805
Time of my life!

454
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,057
Oh, dear.

455
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,140
I haven't enjoyed
Myself so much for years.

456
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:42,766
Now you must have
Your reward.

457
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,350
I'm going to get you a
Delightful partner to dance with.

458
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:49,351
How do you
Like them-

459
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:50,851
Dark? Fair?
Bashful? Dashing?

460
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:53,268
Ha ha! I'm going to be hard to please.

461
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:54,936
I'll be
Back in a moment

462
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:56,436
With a lucky
Youngster.

463
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:59,436
Don't let anyone
Run off with you!

464
00:25:15,274 --> 00:25:18,733
John, my boy!
Ha ha! Well met.

465
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,858
The very man
I'm looking for.

466
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,608
Glad to see you, sir.
It's been ages.

467
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:24,233
I've brought a girl-
A charming girl.

468
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:26,609
Promised her a topping
Partner, and you fill the bill.

469
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,109
I'm sorry, sir.
The fact is-

470
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,609
A delightful child!
You'll bless me.

471
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:31,777
Yes, I'm sure I should.
I know your taste.

472
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:34,069
The fact is, I have a
Sort of an appointment.

473
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:36,403
Bertie's cousin from australia
- she's a girl I've never seen,

474
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:39,278
But he's going to be late, and
I promised to take care of her.

475
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,903
Pig in a poke, eh?
That's too bad.

476
00:25:40,946 --> 00:25:43,738
How are you going to find
Her if you've never seen her?

477
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:46,238
I'm to wait for her
In the adam room.

478
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:47,572
Of course,
It's early yet,

479
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,572
But I'd like to get
There before she does.

480
00:25:49,656 --> 00:25:52,114
The adam room, eh? Do you
Know where the adam room is?

481
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:53,281
No. I haven't
Any idea.

482
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:54,906
Come along.
I'll show you.

483
00:25:58,282 --> 00:26:00,199
Through those double
Doors in the corner-

484
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,699
That's what
You're looking for.

485
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:04,700
Oh, thanks. I'm sorry I can't
Oblige, but duty must be done.

486
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,701
That's all right.
Good hunting.

487
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:08,409
Hello, John.

488
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:46,209
Hello. You must be
Bertie's cousin nancy.

489
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:47,708
I'm John Ashwood.

490
00:26:47,793 --> 00:26:49,585
Hope I haven't
Kept you waiting.

491
00:26:49,627 --> 00:26:51,585
Ha ha! No,
Not at all.

492
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:54,502
Well, I came early. I
Thought I'd be here first.

493
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:57,461
I know it's awful to be hanging
About when you don't know anyone.

494
00:26:57,545 --> 00:27:00,170
Yes, it is, isn't it? I
Suppose the colonel sent you.

495
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:03,170
No, bertie sent me. He told
Me to tell you he'd be late.

496
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:05,463
He's detained at the foreign
Office. The weekly crisis, I suppose.

497
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:08,672
He said you weren't
To wait supper for him.

498
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:11,672
As a matter of fact, he said you were
To try and behave as if I were he.

499
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,130
Do you think
You can?

500
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,632
I'm sure of it, quite easily,
But you see, I'm afraid-

501
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:18,132
I hear this is your
First visit to england.

502
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,133
Yes, it is. But you're
Not staying very long.

503
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:21,632
No, indeed,
Not long at all.

504
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:24,092
We must make the most of it, mustn't we?

505
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,675
May I have the pleasure of this dance?

506
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,384
I should love it.

507
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:33,010
This is
My favorite waltz.

508
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,177
Mine, too.

509
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,510
Splendid.

510
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:23,604
This is a stroke of luck
Meeting you like this.

511
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:25,563
The joke is,
I didn't want to come.

512
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:29,106
Had a regimental dinner and told old
Bertie he was no end of a nuisance.

513
00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:31,439
Can you imagine?
I might have missed you.

514
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:41,274
Oh, what a pity.
Right in the middle.

515
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:43,608
It's the, uh,
King and queen.

516
00:28:43,692 --> 00:28:45,525
Oh. Oh,
I'd forgotten.

517
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:49,901
Man: their majesties
The king and queen.

518
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,530
Mercy, they're coming
Right towards us.

519
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:13,073
What shall I do?

520
00:29:13,156 --> 00:29:14,614
Oh, just curtsy.

521
00:29:14,698 --> 00:29:16,156
Like this?

522
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,823
Ha ha! No,
The usual thing.

523
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:19,324
I forgot you're
An australian.

524
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:20,824
Well, put
One foot back

525
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:22,699
And bend the knee,
You know?

526
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:24,199
Which one?

527
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:26,034
Right foot,
Left knee.

528
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,081
Bravo.

529
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,207
You must think
I'm terribly awkward,

530
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,041
But we don't do that
Sort of thing back home.

531
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:03,042
You haven't been
Presented at court?

532
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,500
Oh, good gracious, no.

533
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:06,876
I know lots
Of americans are,

534
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,209
But I'm just
A small-town girl.

535
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:11,501
But bertie said
You were australian.

536
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:15,836
Oh. Oh, of course.

537
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,669
In all the excitement,
I forgot.

538
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:22,045
I'm not nancy. I'm not
Bertie's australian cousin.

539
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:25,170
I'm... I'm an impostor.

540
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:28,005
Good heavens.

541
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,214
I say,
Are you really?

542
00:30:30,256 --> 00:30:31,672
Who are you?

543
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:34,172
Oh, I'm nobody
In particular.

544
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:36,174
I come from a little town
Called tolliver

545
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:39,007
In the smallest state
In the u.s.a.

546
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:40,591
Well, why didn't you
Tell me?

547
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:42,967
You didn't give me
Much time.

548
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,175
Besides...

549
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:47,884
I sort of wanted
To dance with you.

550
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:51,927
Did you? I say,
That's splendid.

551
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,635
I say,
That's splendid.

552
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,469
Won't you?

553
00:30:58,553 --> 00:31:00,470
I don't really
Belong here.

554
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:03,304
An old gentleman from our
Boardinghouse brought me

555
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:04,763
In the kindness
Of his heart.

556
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:06,471
Not colonel
Forsythe?

557
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:09,138
Yes! You know him?

558
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:11,931
He wanted me to meet
You. I turned you down.

559
00:31:12,015 --> 00:31:13,431
Can you imagine?

560
00:31:13,515 --> 00:31:16,682
I say, this is splendid.
You living in london?

561
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:18,933
No. We're
Going home tomorrow.

562
00:31:18,974 --> 00:31:20,307
But I've just
Met you.

563
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,433
You can't go home
Tomorrow. I can't allow it.

564
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:23,933
You don't want to,
Do you?

565
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:26,642
No, I don't,
But my father does.

566
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:29,143
You see, it's rained
Every day,

567
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:32,476
And besides, he's a bit
Prejudiced about london, anyway.

568
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,477
What, do you mean
He doesn't like us?

569
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,436
Well, lots of people
Don't, you know.

570
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,478
He had a fearful quarrel
With the colonel

571
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,979
About the war of 1812.

572
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:43,313
Hmm. We didn't fight
In 1812, did we?

573
00:31:43,354 --> 00:31:44,854
That's the time you
Burned washington.

574
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:46,813
What, burned
The general?

575
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:48,647
No, no. The city.

576
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,647
Oh!

577
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:53,564
We burned it?
Oh, what a pity.

578
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:56,565
Well, no wonder people
Don't like us.

579
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:59,607
I say, I apologize
On behalf of england.

580
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:01,566
I accept your apology.

581
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:04,358
I would like to talk to your
Father and get him to let you stay.

582
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,067
Do you mean to say you've
Never been out of london?

583
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:07,943
I've really not seen
Much of london.

584
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,234
I've never seen london
At night.

585
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:12,735
We have the night
Before us.

586
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:16,111
Yes. My last night
In england.

587
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,236
Wait here. I'm going
To find the colonel

588
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,237
And tell him
I'm taking you home.

589
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:23,321
I say, don't you go
Running off again

590
00:32:23,404 --> 00:32:25,446
With the first man
Who asks you.

591
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:12,372
It's vast,
Isn't it?

592
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:14,332
Biggest city
In the world.

593
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,832
No. New york is that.

594
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,874
Isn't it?

595
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,666
If you say so.

596
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,208
You're nice. I wish my
Father could meet you.

597
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,333
He thinks english people
Are hard to get along with.

598
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:29,335
Well, you do
Have to know them.

599
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:31,335
But we're doing very well, aren't we?

600
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:34,502
You did get a bit uppity when I
Said I thought titles were silly.

601
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:36,002
A bit what?

602
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:37,836
Uppity. You know,
On your high horse.

603
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,378
Oh.

604
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:40,837
Not uppity.

605
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:42,713
No. I was
Scared.

606
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:44,046
Scared? Why?

607
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,546
Guilty
Conscience.

608
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:48,380
You see...
I have a title.

609
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:50,005
I'm a baronet.

610
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,756
A baronet? What's that,
A lord?

611
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,257
No, it's not
Quite so grand.

612
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,465
Well, I'm...

613
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,174
I'm sir John
Ashwood.

614
00:33:59,216 --> 00:34:02,008
Sir John.

615
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,468
This will be something to tell
The girls back in tolliver.

616
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:08,967
Ha ha!

617
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,635
May I?

618
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,969
Have you ever
Been to america?

619
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,511
Oh, yes. I was
In canada last year.

620
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:20,470
Well, it's not quite
The same, you know.

621
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:23,429
We're those queer colonists
Who wanted to be free.

622
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:24,429
Oh.

623
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:26,638
Who's uppity now?

624
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:27,930
Ha ha ha!

625
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:29,305
I'm sorry.

626
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:31,139
Do you work
For a living?

627
00:34:31,223 --> 00:34:33,306
Yes, quite hard. I'm a captain
In the king's fusiliers.

628
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,140
You know,
If bertie hadn't-

629
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:38,474
Angels and ministers
Of grace, defend us.

630
00:34:38,516 --> 00:34:39,974
What's the matter?

631
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:41,641
I never gave it a
Thought until this moment.

632
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,141
Nancy.

633
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,141
I promised
To take care of her.

634
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:46,642
Bertie will never
Forgive me.

635
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,309
Oh, dear.
What can we do?

636
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:50,476
Nothing. She can hardly be sitting
Waiting for me in the adam room

637
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,893
At 3:00 in the morning.

638
00:34:51,935 --> 00:34:53,101
No.

639
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:55,602
It's all my fault.

640
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:57,436
I'm awfully sorry.

641
00:34:57,478 --> 00:34:59,103
Yes, so am I.

642
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:01,603
No, I'm not.

643
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,312
You know, I feel
An awful cad,

644
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:07,438
But if it hadn't happened,
I should never have met you.

645
00:35:14,607 --> 00:35:16,065
How still it is.

646
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:19,066
I never knew london
Could be so still.

647
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:22,608
When wordsworth stood here, he could
See green fields in the distance

648
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,483
And tall oak trees.

649
00:35:26,943 --> 00:35:29,568
Don't go back
To america.

650
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,443
I must.

651
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:35,194
There's so much
To see.

652
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:37,569
Let me show you england.

653
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:41,070
We'll drive down roman roads
Where caesar's legions marched

654
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:43,237
And follow chaucer's
Steps to canterbury.

655
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:45,363
I'll show you the isle of
Avalon where king arthur died

656
00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:47,738
And the holy grail
Is buried.

657
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:50,572
Beautiful places.
Old places.

658
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,573
Little villages that were
Standing in the wars of the roses.

659
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:57,282
And jolly places. You know, there's
A moat at wales where the swans swim

660
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:01,200
And ring a bell for their
Dinner when they're hungry.

661
00:36:01,283 --> 00:36:02,866
I say,
You're crying.

662
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,366
No. No, I'm not.

663
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,367
I... He's...

664
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:08,159
Oh, how stupid
You are.

665
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:11,035
I don't want to go back,
And you're making it worse.

666
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,702
I'm a hopeless idiot.
I ought to be kicked.

667
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:14,827
I ought to go
And hang myself.

668
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:16,160
Oh, no. No,
Don't do that.

669
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:18,536
It was just that last bit
About the swans that got me.

670
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:19,911
Do they really do that?

671
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:21,161
Oh, yes. They do.
I've seen them.

672
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,495
There's a little house,
And they all-

673
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:23,579
Don't.

674
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:26,872
Don't tell me any more.
Not another word.

675
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:30,622
I have to go back
To america...

676
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:33,373
And back to
The boardinghouse now.

677
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:34,372
Listen.

678
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:36,832
There's big ben.

679
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:06,004
I wish I thought you
Minded as much as I do.

680
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:07,463
Oh, I do mind.

681
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:09,297
I dropped tears
All over my packing.

682
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:12,798
Now I mind even-

683
00:37:12,881 --> 00:37:16,173
I mean, it's been
A wonderful night.

684
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:19,632
When I think of england,
I shall always think of you.

685
00:37:19,716 --> 00:37:22,591
A bit set in her ways,
A bit sure of herself,

686
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:26,092
But nice.
Very, very nice.

687
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:29,468
And will you think
Often of england?

688
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,802
I'm afraid I shall.

689
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:32,844
Miss Dunn-

690
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:34,803
Please don't say it.

691
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:38,678
I must go now.
I see the milkman.

692
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:43,846
Good-bye.

693
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,723
Good-bye.

694
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:00,058
Good-bye...

695
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,767
England.

696
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:43,483
Mr. Dunn?

697
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:44,525
Mr. Dunn? Yes, sir.

698
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:46,401
That is, he's leaving
In a minute, sir.

699
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:48,567
Yes, I know. I wonder if he
Could spare me one moment?

700
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:49,942
Tell him sir John
Ashwood, please.

701
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:50,943
Sir John...

702
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:51,818
Ashwood.

703
00:38:51,902 --> 00:38:53,360
Oh, yes, sir!

704
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,027
Step in, sir.

705
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,403
A gentleman
To see you, sir.

706
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:01,195
Good morning,
Miss Dunn.

707
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:02,862
Good morning, sir.

708
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:06,863
I know this is an inopportune moment.

709
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:08,530
I hope you'll
Forgive me.

710
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:11,072
Father, this is sir John Ashwood,
Who brought me home last night.

711
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:13,364
Oh. Well, I'm
Glad to meet you.

712
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:16,865
I'm sorry we haven't much time.
Fact is, we're a bit rushed.

713
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:19,199
Our train
Leaves at 10:00.

714
00:39:19,283 --> 00:39:21,366
I've come in the hope that I
Can persuade you to miss it.

715
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,367
What was that?

716
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,033
Uh, I hope your lumbago's better, sir.

717
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:28,700
Yes. Well, it will be when I
Get away from this eternal rain.

718
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:29,951
It's pretty bad,
Isn't it?

719
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,368
But we seem to be in for
A spell of fine weather.

720
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:34,869
Oh, are we? Well,
It's about time.

721
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:36,369
Right you are, sir.

722
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:38,536
Mr. Dunn, uh... My
Mother lives in devon,

723
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:40,828
And at any moment, she
May call you on the phone.

724
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,537
My mother would be delighted
If you and miss Dunn

725
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,746
Could spend a week
Or two with us

726
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,913
And see some typical
English country life.

727
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:50,372
Oh, hold on,
Hold on there.

728
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:52,498
Well, that's
Out of the question.

729
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:55,706
Good heavens, man. We're
Practically on the train.

730
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,373
Besides, we don't know your
Mother, and she doesn't know us.

731
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,499
What is it, gwennie?

732
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,250
Please, sir, can the man
Take the trunk down?

733
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:02,457
Oh, yes.
Come in.

734
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:07,042
You see, sir, I run a newspaper,
And I have to get back to it.

735
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:08,375
Oh, yes, of course.

736
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:10,043
I suppose it
Wouldn't be possible

737
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:12,252
For miss Dunn to remain behind alone?

738
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:13,710
What? What's that?

739
00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:16,085
Oh, my mother would take the
Greatest care of her, sir.

740
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,045
The cab's
Here, sir.

741
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:18,378
Oh. Tell him
We'll be right down.

742
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,711
Can I take
The suitcase, sir?

743
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,212
Yes. You can take
This one.

744
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,546
Now you see, we're going
Now. Come on, susie.

745
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,545
Allow me, sir.

746
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,672
Oh, thank you.

747
00:40:26,755 --> 00:40:30,547
About miss Dunn, sir, I'm sure you'd
Like her to have a little pleasure.

748
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,172
Oh, yes. Well...

749
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,714
I'll put her on
A later boat myself.

750
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,215
Miss Dunn has such a fine
Historical sense, sir.

751
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:38,882
It seems a pity that she should
Be denied the advantage of travel.

752
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:40,549
Susan, have you
A half crown?

753
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:42,091
This infernal money.

754
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:45,550
Every civilized nation in the
World has a decimal system,

755
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:47,884
But england has to still cling
To an antiquated-

756
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:49,259
Right you are, sir,
But that makes for

757
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:50,634
A certain amount of
Interest, doesn't it?

758
00:40:50,718 --> 00:40:51,718
Are you still here?

759
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:53,135
I mean the little differences, you know.

760
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,677
What do you want?
Good heavens, man!

761
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,177
I can't leave my daughter behind
In a strange country.

762
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,012
Come on, susan.
We'll miss our train.

763
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:00,178
It's for you,
Mr. Dunn.

764
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,136
What is it?

765
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:02,179
Lady Jean Ashwood.

766
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:03,346
Oh. Well, tell her
We've gone.

767
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:04,346
My mother, sir.

768
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:05,304
It's a trunk call!

769
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:06,304
But I haven't time
To talk to her,

770
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:08,180
And it wouldn't do
Any good, anyhow.

771
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:10,139
Well, susan, don't stand there
Like a wooden indian.

772
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:11,306
Say something.

773
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:13,681
Tell this obstinate young man
That you can't stay,

774
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:14,973
That you don't
Want to stay.

775
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,182
But I do,
Father.what?

776
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,640
I want to
Very much.

777
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:19,057
You see, sir?

778
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:20,390
You keep out of this. You mean
You'd have me go home alone?

779
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:21,849
Would you mind
Very much?

780
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:22,974
I'm holding
The line, Mr. Dunn.

781
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:23,974
Well, of all
The unfeeling-

782
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:25,100
Just a week.

783
00:41:25,184 --> 00:41:26,350
Just a week, darling.
I'll take the next boat.

784
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:27,350
We'll take good care of her, sir.

785
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:28,309
The cab, sir.

786
00:41:28,393 --> 00:41:29,518
The telephone,
Mr. Dunn.

787
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,643
Oh! Holy mackerel!

788
00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:35,519
The cab, the phone,
My daughter, my lumbago!

789
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:38,311
Hello? Hello?

790
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,312
Dunn speaking.
Hiram p. Dunn.

791
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:55,023
I expect you'd like to go
To your room, miss Dunn.

792
00:41:55,107 --> 00:41:56,732
You must be tired
After your long drive.

793
00:41:56,774 --> 00:41:59,732
Thank you, but honestly,
I'm too excited to be tired.

794
00:41:59,774 --> 00:42:01,149
Really? That's
Charming of you.

795
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:03,316
Then perhaps you'd like
To see the gardens first?

796
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,984
They look lovely
At this hour.

797
00:42:05,026 --> 00:42:06,442
Yes, I would,
Lady Jean.

798
00:42:06,526 --> 00:42:08,276
Suppose you take miss Dunn
For a little stroll, John?

799
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,526
Yes, that's
A splendid idea.

800
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,568
It's so nice
To have you here.

801
00:42:10,652 --> 00:42:11,568
Thank you.

802
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:12,527
Come on, susan.

803
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,776
I'll let you know
When tea's ready.

804
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:15,277
We're rather proud
Of our lawn.

805
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:16,819
It's very old,
You know.

806
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:20,736
Not bad, eh,
The girl?

807
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:22,237
Very attractive.

808
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:24,237
Worried, old lady?

809
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,780
I'm rather
Bewildered.

810
00:42:25,822 --> 00:42:27,238
Well, it looks serious.

811
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,613
An old stick-in-the-mud
Like John

812
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:30,572
Meets a girl for the first time
Last night

813
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,072
And brings her home
To the family.

814
00:42:32,198 --> 00:42:33,739
I thought there was some
Sort of an understanding

815
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:35,281
Between John and the hampton girl.

816
00:42:35,365 --> 00:42:38,115
Oh, helen? She's mad about
Old John. Always has been.

817
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,782
I'm worried
About helen.

818
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,783
Not that John is
In any way committed,

819
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:43,992
But I'm afraid helen's taking
Things too much for granted.

820
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:45,409
You're fond of helen, aren't you?

821
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:48,492
She's a sweet girl,
And she's right for John.

822
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:50,451
Oh, by the by, I'm going over
To the hamptons.

823
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:53,368
I'll tell helen that John's
Coming home and ask her to dinner.

824
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:54,702
It might be amusing.

825
00:42:54,786 --> 00:42:56,202
You know, it's odd.

826
00:42:56,286 --> 00:42:59,036
John's like you. He's straight and good.

827
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,037
My precious husband is
An out-and-out rotter.

828
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:03,038
Thank you.

829
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,037
He's unscrupulous,
And he's crude.

830
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,747
But you love him
Best, don't you?

831
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:08,204
I have no favorites.

832
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:11,372
Reggie's like
His father.

833
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:13,206
I adored his father.

834
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:19,541
Oh, miller, will you tell sir John
And miss Dunn that tea is ready?

835
00:43:19,624 --> 00:43:21,040
Yes, my lady.

836
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:29,501
I spent days in that
Manor house in devon.

837
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:33,794
I roamed with John
Beneath the old great trees

838
00:43:33,836 --> 00:43:37,045
In gardens trampled down
By cromwell's armies,

839
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:41,086
Through foliage rustling
In the wet, soft breeze.

840
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:44,713
John showed with pride
The ancient lettered casement

841
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:48,380
That watched the proud armada
Pass the coast,

842
00:43:48,464 --> 00:43:51,547
Some of the pictured forebears
In the gallery,

843
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:55,340
And told the legend
Of the family ghost.

844
00:44:05,051 --> 00:44:08,426
Well, here are
The ancestors.

845
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,468
Awful lot of them,
Aren't there?

846
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:12,510
I thought they'd look
More solemn somehow.

847
00:44:12,594 --> 00:44:15,302
Well, you see, they didn't
Know they were ancestors.

848
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,303
They just mixed in with
Whatever was going on.

849
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:18,677
Tell me about
Them, John.

850
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,970
Really?
Really.

851
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:21,137
All right.

852
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:23,888
But don't forget, you
Brought it on yourself.

853
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:26,013
The most noble knight,
Percy Ashwood of ash,

854
00:44:26,055 --> 00:44:28,013
1233-1265.

855
00:44:28,055 --> 00:44:30,513
It was probably painted
Some centuries later.

856
00:44:30,556 --> 00:44:32,848
Percy was killed at
The battle of evesham.

857
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:37,307
And this is his wife,
The first Lady Ashwood.

858
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:41,141
We're indebted to her
For the family ghost.

859
00:44:41,183 --> 00:44:42,641
The family ghost?

860
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:44,975
No. Tell me about it.

861
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,976
Well, rumors of the
Battle had reached her,

862
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,351
And as night fell, she heard
The sound of galloping hooves.

863
00:44:50,393 --> 00:44:52,935
She came out onto the
Steps with her ladies

864
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:54,936
And waited in the light of torches,

865
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:58,061
Hoping perhaps that her
Husband was returning.

866
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:01,604
But a faithful retainer
Of the family rode up,

867
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:04,187
His face white as wax
And his voice hollow

868
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:06,729
As he gave
The fatal tidings.

869
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:08,730
And even while
This was happening,

870
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:10,230
According
To the legend,

871
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:12,939
Peasants were fishing
His body out of the river.

872
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:15,898
He'd been drowned fording the
Stream more than an hour before.

873
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,607
It was a ghostly
Messenger?

874
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:19,816
Riding
A ghostly horse.

875
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:22,274
Oh, John,
It's wonderful.

876
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:24,067
And does the ghost
Still ride?

877
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,608
Yes, so they say.

878
00:45:25,692 --> 00:45:28,275
Whenever a male of the clan
Is gathered to his ancestors,

879
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,610
The women of the family hear
The hoofbeats of the messenger

880
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:32,276
As he rides down
The old roman road.

881
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,735
Do you believe it?

882
00:45:33,819 --> 00:45:35,277
I can't say
That I do.

883
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:36,277
I've a suspicion my mother does, though,

884
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,278
And she's
A levelheaded woman.

885
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:41,987
Anyway, she doesn't like to
Hear anyone laugh at the story.

886
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:44,446
This is the ancestral black sheep.

887
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:47,113
He guessed wrong on the war of the roses

888
00:45:47,155 --> 00:45:48,571
And was executed
For treason.

889
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:54,281
Well,
I'm worn out.

890
00:45:54,365 --> 00:45:55,573
Aren't you
Fed up with us?

891
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:58,073
Not a bit.
It's most exciting.

892
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:02,241
Yes. This gorgeous officer
Is the present baronet

893
00:46:02,283 --> 00:46:03,699
And your
Humble servant.

894
00:46:03,742 --> 00:46:05,700
How is it you
Weren't called percy?

895
00:46:05,784 --> 00:46:08,201
Well, the eldest son
Is always called percy.

896
00:46:08,285 --> 00:46:10,868
I had an elder brother
Who died as a child.

897
00:46:12,911 --> 00:46:17,203
Here, my... Wife's
Portrait will hang.

898
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:21,370
Oh. You must have often
Wondered what she'd be like.

899
00:46:21,454 --> 00:46:22,704
Yes, I have...

900
00:46:22,788 --> 00:46:24,455
Until a few
Days ago.

901
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:33,497
Then, I began to hope
That she'd be...

902
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:37,248
Oh, tall and fair
With a mind of her own,

903
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:40,374
And that when my great-grandson
Showed visitors her portrait,

904
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:43,250
He'd say, "this is
My great-grandmother.

905
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:47,043
Lovely, isn't she?
She was an american."

906
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:52,835
Oh, John.

907
00:46:54,336 --> 00:46:56,128
You must have known.

908
00:46:56,211 --> 00:46:59,336
I've been out of my mind since
I first saw you in the adam room.

909
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,337
I meant to wait, give you
More time, but it's out now.

910
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:10,839
Don't say no, sue.

911
00:47:10,923 --> 00:47:13,840
If you can't... Give me
The right answer,

912
00:47:13,882 --> 00:47:15,549
Pretend
I haven't spoken.

913
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,340
May I do that, John?

914
00:47:17,382 --> 00:47:19,174
For these few days.

915
00:47:19,216 --> 00:47:20,632
I don't want
To make decisions.

916
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:23,633
I just want to live
And be happy.

917
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:26,342
You are happy, sue?
Happy here?

918
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:28,176
When we are
Together, yes.

919
00:47:28,218 --> 00:47:29,468
When we are alone...

920
00:47:29,551 --> 00:47:30,967
What does that mean?

921
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,635
Please don't ask me.

922
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,302
It's just that-well,
It's all so strange.

923
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:38,261
This place,
Your family.

924
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:39,719
Sue...

925
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,554
John!

926
00:47:47,222 --> 00:47:49,180
John!

927
00:47:56,849 --> 00:47:57,765
John?

928
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:58,724
Here, mother.

929
00:47:58,808 --> 00:48:01,391
Oh, there you are.
Is that miss Dunn?

930
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:03,433
Yes, of course
It is.

931
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:06,142
Helen's going to sing, John, dear. I
Thought perhaps you'd like to come down.

932
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:08,142
Of course. Be with you
In a jiffy.

933
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:21,437
Flow gently,
Sweet afton

934
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:26,188
Disturb not
Her dream

935
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:29,147
Thou stock dove
Whose echo

936
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:32,648
Resounds
From the hill

937
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,815
Ye wild, whistling
Blackbird

938
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:40,983
In yon
Thorny dell

939
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:47,151
Thou green-crested
Lapwing

940
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:58,569
Thy screaming
Forbear

941
00:48:58,653 --> 00:49:07,029
My
Slumbering fair

942
00:49:07,113 --> 00:49:09,363
Thank you, my dear.
That's a favorite of mine.

943
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,530
Yeah. Very nice. Now how about
A rubber of bridge, huh?

944
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:13,823
Oh, rupert,
It's after 10:00.

945
00:49:13,865 --> 00:49:14,823
Is it?

946
00:49:14,907 --> 00:49:16,240
Shall we go out
Into the terrace?

947
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:18,657
It's mild
In this moon.

948
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:19,741
John, helen must
Go home now.

949
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:20,741
Oh, mother can
Send for me.

950
00:49:20,783 --> 00:49:21,908
No, John wouldn't
Hear of it.

951
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,742
Certainly not.
I shan't be long.

952
00:49:23,784 --> 00:49:24,700
It's just across
The path.

953
00:49:24,784 --> 00:49:26,242
Come and see us
One day, miss Dunn.

954
00:49:26,284 --> 00:49:27,534
Perhaps John will
Bring you to tea.

955
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:28,576
Do please come,
Won't you?

956
00:49:28,618 --> 00:49:29,701
I should love it.

957
00:49:29,743 --> 00:49:31,201
Come on,
Nuisance.

958
00:49:31,244 --> 00:49:32,244
Good night,
Lady Jean.

959
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:33,201
Good night,
My dear.

960
00:49:33,244 --> 00:49:34,202
Good night, all.

961
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:35,702
Good night.
Good night.

962
00:49:35,786 --> 00:49:38,661
Is it serious
Between those two?

963
00:49:38,703 --> 00:49:40,203
Oh, it's one
Of those things-

964
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:42,204
Boy and girl sweethearts,
Parents' blessing.

965
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:44,537
Yes, I suppose
They're for it.

966
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:46,162
Mmm, they're
A nice couple.

967
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:49,747
I should never have taken you
For an american, miss Dunn.

968
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:50,705
No?

969
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:52,789
You don't speak
Like one.

970
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:55,081
American women are
So smart and pretty,

971
00:49:55,123 --> 00:49:56,539
But their voices-

972
00:49:56,624 --> 00:49:59,582
I've no doubt our voices sound
Equally strange to americans.

973
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:01,416
Yes. Enjoy london,
Miss Dunn?

974
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:02,416
Very much.

975
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,417
You stayed at the savoy,
I suppose, huh?

976
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,542
Americans always stay
At the savoy.

977
00:50:07,626 --> 00:50:08,709
No, we didn't stay
At the savoy.

978
00:50:08,793 --> 00:50:10,710
We stayed at mrs. Bland's boardinghouse

979
00:50:10,752 --> 00:50:11,710
In bloomsbury.

980
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:12,877
Bloomsbury?

981
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:14,252
What is it,
Nanny?

982
00:50:14,336 --> 00:50:16,544
It's a telegram
For the young lady.

983
00:50:16,628 --> 00:50:19,753
Michael murphy had to get out of
His warm bed to bring it along.

984
00:50:19,837 --> 00:50:21,170
It's from the ship, he says.
The young lady's father.

985
00:50:21,212 --> 00:50:22,170
May I?

986
00:50:22,254 --> 00:50:23,670
Of course,
My dear.

987
00:50:23,713 --> 00:50:25,588
I would think that some people
Would say what they had to say

988
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,255
While they were still here
To say it, if you ask me.

989
00:50:27,297 --> 00:50:28,255
Nanny?

990
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:29,213
Yes, my lady?

991
00:50:29,297 --> 00:50:30,422
Thank you,
Nanny.

992
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:34,048
Foreign ways.

993
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,423
You must excuse nanny.

994
00:50:35,507 --> 00:50:36,590
She's brought up
All my children,

995
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:38,424
So she thinks she has
The right to bully us.

996
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:40,049
Better get helen
And John married

997
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:43,216
And keep her busy with a new generation.

998
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,508
I hope your father's
Recovered from our climate.

999
00:50:45,551 --> 00:50:47,384
I suppose you'll find
Our houses cold.

1000
00:50:47,468 --> 00:50:49,551
I suffocated
In new york.

1001
00:50:49,635 --> 00:50:51,051
Don't know how
You stand it.

1002
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:53,510
Great city, though,
When you get used to it.

1003
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:55,302
Yes, I met some quite
Nice people there.

1004
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:57,844
You speak as though that
Were rather surprising.

1005
00:50:57,928 --> 00:51:01,011
Well, I must admit, I'd only
Met the traveling americans,

1006
00:51:01,096 --> 00:51:03,513
And the traveling
American... You know.

1007
00:51:03,596 --> 00:51:07,138
Remember those dreadful people
We bumped into in rome, my dear?

1008
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,181
But miss Dunn isn't a
Bit like an american.

1009
00:51:10,264 --> 00:51:12,431
You don't mean
To be rude, do you?

1010
00:51:12,515 --> 00:51:15,140
No, of course
Not.

1011
00:51:15,224 --> 00:51:16,390
Why, whatever-

1012
00:51:16,432 --> 00:51:18,515
On the contrary, it was
Intended as a compliment.

1013
00:51:18,558 --> 00:51:21,350
But sooner or later, you all
Say something of the kind.

1014
00:51:21,391 --> 00:51:24,850
"so you're an american, miss Dunn?
Really? You don't speak like one.

1015
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:28,017
So you're an american, miss Dunn?
Really? You don't act like one."

1016
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:30,809
My dear, my sister had no
Intention of offending you.

1017
00:51:30,852 --> 00:51:32,852
Just the same, it was tactless.
Utterly tactless.

1018
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:34,352
Well, upon
My word.

1019
00:51:34,436 --> 00:51:36,811
It's a compliment not to be
Like an american. How insulting.

1020
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:38,812
A compliment not to speak
Like an american.

1021
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,812
I suppose if you wanted
To be altogether flattering,

1022
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:42,354
You'd say I was
Quite english.

1023
00:51:42,438 --> 00:51:43,521
Well, I shouldn't
Be flattered at all.

1024
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:44,562
I'm glad and proud
To be an american.

1025
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:46,272
Bravo, bravo.

1026
00:51:46,313 --> 00:51:49,480
I came here loving england and all it
Meant to me. I was happy to come here.

1027
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,606
I was so sure I'd like you all
Because of John.

1028
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,190
I hoped you'd like me.

1029
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:55,190
My dear-

1030
00:51:55,232 --> 00:51:56,690
But I was an outsider.
I didn't belong.

1031
00:51:56,774 --> 00:51:58,357
You made that
Perfectly clear.

1032
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:01,149
Well, it may interest you to know
My father's entirely of your opinion.

1033
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:03,316
Perhaps I should
Read you his cable.

1034
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,775
"been pacing deck
And cursing myself

1035
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,484
For leaving you in the hands
Of that englishman."

1036
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:07,859
Upon my word.

1037
00:52:07,943 --> 00:52:11,318
"you come right home, my girl,
Without foreign entanglements.

1038
00:52:11,402 --> 00:52:13,777
"marry a regular,
Warm-hearted american.

1039
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:15,611
"you're a yankee
Through and through.

1040
00:52:15,694 --> 00:52:18,611
"never forget it.
Think of paul revere.

1041
00:52:18,695 --> 00:52:21,362
"think of the old
North steeple.

1042
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,779
"remember the alabama.

1043
00:52:23,863 --> 00:52:25,946
"this is a mighty
Expensive message,

1044
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,572
"and that will show you
I'm scared stiff.

1045
00:52:28,655 --> 00:52:31,947
I am your devoted father."

1046
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:35,865
Neither you nor my father
Need have any anxiety.

1047
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:38,991
Miss Dunn,
Wait.

1048
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:41,658
Oh, I'm so terribly
Sorry I started all this.

1049
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,658
I had no intention
Of hurting you.

1050
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,617
Won't you put it down
To my stupidity

1051
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:50,618
And... Forgive me?

1052
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:52,118
Susan.

1053
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,368
May I call
You susan?

1054
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:56,411
I've been hoping
You would.

1055
00:52:56,495 --> 00:52:57,870
I want you
To understand

1056
00:52:57,912 --> 00:53:00,412
That if there's been anything
In my manner to hurt you,

1057
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:02,704
It's been nothing
To do with John.

1058
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:04,371
It's just that-
Well,

1059
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:07,580
Perhaps we express ourselves
A little differently.

1060
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:09,289
Perhaps we do, too.

1061
00:53:09,372 --> 00:53:11,914
The english are anything but effusive.

1062
00:53:11,998 --> 00:53:14,915
The scots are worse,
And I'm a scot, you know.

1063
00:53:14,998 --> 00:53:17,415
So if I've hurt you,
My dear,

1064
00:53:17,499 --> 00:53:19,832
It was in my manner,
Not in my heart.

1065
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:21,249
Please
Understand that.

1066
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:24,750
I know. I'm sorry.

1067
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:26,584
I'm so ashamed of myself.

1068
00:53:26,626 --> 00:53:28,584
Really.

1069
00:53:28,626 --> 00:53:31,584
Here I've made
A stupid scene.

1070
00:53:31,627 --> 00:53:35,377
I guess I'm just a little
Homesick, that's all.

1071
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:37,544
I hope you'll forgive me.

1072
00:53:40,837 --> 00:53:43,754
Will you tell John
That I have a headache

1073
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:45,213
And that I've gone to bed?

1074
00:53:45,296 --> 00:53:48,755
I'll tell him. Good night, susan.

1075
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,089
Good night.

1076
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:01,341
The boat train rattling
Through the green countryside,

1077
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:05,342
The girl within it battling
With her tears and pride,

1078
00:54:05,426 --> 00:54:09,301
Believing in her blindness
That she was heart-whole yet.

1079
00:54:09,385 --> 00:54:12,135
His love, his laugh,
His kindness-

1080
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:15,886
In time, she could forget.

1081
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:32,597
The washington,
Miss?

1082
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,598
Yes, please.

1083
00:54:33,682 --> 00:54:35,098
Nice, steady
Boat.

1084
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,265
Yes. I came over
On her.

1085
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:45,892
John, you shouldn't have
Come all this long way.

1086
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:47,559
I was afraid you'd
Want to see me off.

1087
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:49,017
That's why I ran off
And left a note.

1088
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,185
I've not come to see you off, susan.

1089
00:54:50,268 --> 00:54:51,434
I've come
To take you home.

1090
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:52,477
Home?
To Ashwood.

1091
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:53,977
I don't know what
You're talking about.

1092
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:55,352
Take my things onto
The boat, please.

1093
00:54:55,394 --> 00:54:56,685
I'll give you
My ticket.

1094
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:58,311
Never mind the ticket. The
London train on platform two.

1095
00:54:58,353 --> 00:54:59,644
No, please.

1096
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:00,979
You'll find a carriage reserved
Under the name of Ashwood.

1097
00:55:01,062 --> 00:55:02,312
No, please. You are to take
The luggage onto the boat.

1098
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:03,979
The london train.

1099
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:06,313
John, this is ridiculous! I was
Awake all night, thinking things over,

1100
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:07,605
And I've made up
My mind.

1101
00:55:07,689 --> 00:55:09,105
Shall we...

1102
00:55:09,189 --> 00:55:10,605
I'm not at home
In that great place.

1103
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:13,272
It scares me. I live in a
Little house in a little town.

1104
00:55:13,315 --> 00:55:14,731
I'm used to simple,
Friendly people

1105
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:16,732
Who don't give a hoot
About family and traditions.

1106
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:17,774
Yes, but, darling-

1107
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:19,107
I've been homesick.

1108
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,607
I've got a terrible longing
For our green mountains,

1109
00:55:20,691 --> 00:55:22,441
For daddy and his
Tempers-for anything american.

1110
00:55:22,525 --> 00:55:24,483
Hot dogs,
Flapjacks...

1111
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:26,275
And your family doesn't
Like me. They resent me.

1112
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:27,817
Your mother wants you to marry helen.

1113
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:29,442
Helen's in love with
You, John. Helen fits in.

1114
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,151
She's pretty and conventional and good.

1115
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:32,484
I'm not.
I'm stubborn.

1116
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:34,444
I'm an american
Right through.

1117
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:35,986
I'm not adaptable.
I'm a rebel.

1118
00:55:36,028 --> 00:55:37,069
Yes, but, sue-

1119
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:38,820
Oh, I do love you,
John. I can't deny it.

1120
00:55:38,862 --> 00:55:41,779
I'll remember you to
The last day of my life,

1121
00:55:41,862 --> 00:55:43,278
Only I could
Never be happy.

1122
00:55:43,363 --> 00:55:44,946
I could never
Make you happy.

1123
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,280
Don't make it
Harder for me.

1124
00:55:46,363 --> 00:55:47,613
This has taken courage, John, darling.

1125
00:55:49,072 --> 00:55:51,572
How would you like to be
Married at the american embassy?

1126
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,406
I have a cousin married
To one of the attaches.

1127
00:55:53,448 --> 00:55:54,864
She's an awfully jolly girl.
You'll like her.

1128
00:55:54,907 --> 00:55:57,074
Or would you like a country
Wedding? Mother thought you might.

1129
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:58,573
She sends you all sorts
Of kind messages.

1130
00:55:58,658 --> 00:56:00,241
She's going to move
Into the dower house.

1131
00:56:00,325 --> 00:56:02,242
Says young couples should
Have their homes to themselves.

1132
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,033
You know, I've been wondering
About the honeymoon. Paris?

1133
00:56:04,117 --> 00:56:06,242
You've never been to the
London theater, have you?

1134
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:07,242
Just imagine.
Thank you.

1135
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:08,742
But, John-

1136
00:56:08,826 --> 00:56:10,034
But, John, John-

1137
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:11,409
No. No.
Let me out, dear.

1138
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:13,035
I cabled my father. He's
Meeting me in new york.

1139
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,577
Let me out of here.

1140
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:16,577
I brought a lunch basket. Some
Cold chicken and a bottle of wine-

1141
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,578
Let me out of here,
Do you hear?

1142
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,870
You stupid, arrogant,
Pig-headed englishman.

1143
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:21,912
Let me out!

1144
00:56:21,954 --> 00:56:23,412
Why don't you take
Your hat off, darling?

1145
00:56:23,454 --> 00:56:25,954
And sit down and lean back comfortably.

1146
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:29,747
John.

1147
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:32,081
Sue, you obstinate
Little beast.

1148
00:56:32,165 --> 00:56:34,457
Oh, John.
Sue.

1149
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:13,131
And now, I have the
Honor to propose a toast

1150
00:57:13,173 --> 00:57:14,673
To our hostess.

1151
00:57:14,757 --> 00:57:16,674
To Lady Ashwood.

1152
00:57:16,757 --> 00:57:18,173
Oh, no, no.
Excuse me.

1153
00:57:18,257 --> 00:57:20,340
To Lady Jean
Ashwood.

1154
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:23,592
Lady Ashwood
- that's my daughter. Yes.

1155
00:57:23,634 --> 00:57:27,093
Little sue Dunn gone
High and mighty on us.

1156
00:57:27,134 --> 00:57:30,676
I don't mind telling you that
It was a bit of a shock to me

1157
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,718
When I heard the news
Back in tolliver,

1158
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,135
And I hustled right back to england
To see what I could do about it.

1159
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,804
But the scotch know a good
Thing when they see it.

1160
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:43,179
Hear, hear.

1161
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:46,930
And maybe-maybe my daughter
Knows a good thing, too.

1162
00:57:47,013 --> 00:57:51,555
Well, and now I'm going
Back to america alone.

1163
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,639
Having lost my daughter
To the british,

1164
00:57:53,682 --> 00:57:57,307
I had hoped to take back with me
A certain piece of property

1165
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,432
Also looted
From the united states-

1166
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:02,432
From the white house,
To be exact,

1167
00:58:02,517 --> 00:58:05,475
But apparently, the gentleman
In possession of this stolen item

1168
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:07,642
Is devoid
Of a sense of shame.

1169
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,143
No. Don't get me wrong.

1170
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:14,144
The english are fine.

1171
00:58:14,227 --> 00:58:17,144
Of course, they think england
Is gosh-almighty,

1172
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:23,437
But, uh... A people that's managed to
Collar 1/3 of the earth, my daughter,

1173
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:26,646
And a certain article
From the white house

1174
00:58:26,688 --> 00:58:30,022
Is no small potatoes.

1175
00:58:34,232 --> 00:58:37,149
And that brings me
To my point.

1176
00:58:37,232 --> 00:58:41,441
I raise my glass
To a very charming lady.

1177
00:58:41,525 --> 00:58:45,400
She's british,
But I kind of like her.

1178
00:58:58,945 --> 00:59:01,320
Make a good
Job of it, girl.

1179
00:59:01,362 --> 00:59:02,362
I mean to.

1180
00:59:02,446 --> 00:59:03,362
Bless you both. I'm very happy for you.

1181
00:59:03,446 --> 00:59:04,571
Good-bye, father.

1182
00:59:04,655 --> 00:59:06,238
Take care. Bye.

1183
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:53,206
Yacht, ahoy!

1184
00:59:55,915 --> 00:59:58,498
The sea gull.
Who are you?

1185
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:02,000
Naval patrol e-2.

1186
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:05,501
Stand by to be taken
In tow.

1187
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:06,834
Get your sails in.

1188
01:00:06,876 --> 01:00:07,834
Aye, aye, sir.

1189
01:00:07,876 --> 01:00:11,168
We are bringing you in
With us.

1190
01:00:11,252 --> 01:00:12,793
What's wrong?

1191
01:00:12,836 --> 01:00:16,086
England is at war.

1192
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:20,462
Paper!

1193
01:00:20,504 --> 01:00:22,921
Mercury dispatch!

1194
01:00:23,004 --> 01:00:25,087
Paper! Paper!

1195
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:39,591
The place is a madhouse. I suppose
Everybody is trying to get home.

1196
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:49,926
By george, they're on
Their way to france already.

1197
01:00:55,178 --> 01:00:58,595
I must find a telephone,
Report to the adjutant.

1198
01:00:58,678 --> 01:00:59,928
You mean, you think you
Might have to go at once?

1199
01:01:00,012 --> 01:01:02,429
We'll see, darling.
Don't worry.

1200
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:13,848
There's a telephone box.
Will you wait for me, darling?

1201
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:15,515
I shan't be a minute.

1202
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:24,350
Sue! Hey, sue!
What a stroke of luck!

1203
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:25,850
Sam.

1204
01:01:25,934 --> 01:01:28,392
This is wonderful. I thought
You'd gone back long ago.

1205
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,393
You're going
On the boat, of course.

1206
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:32,685
Where's your father? Can
I do anything to help?

1207
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:34,185
Father's in america.

1208
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:37,853
No, I'm not going back, sam.
I'm staying in england.

1209
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:39,728
Staying here?
With the war on?

1210
01:01:39,812 --> 01:01:40,770
Yes, sam-

1211
01:01:40,854 --> 01:01:42,395
I got the adjutant,
And it's all right.

1212
01:01:42,438 --> 01:01:44,896
I have to get up to town
At once, though.

1213
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:46,896
John, I want you to meet
A friend of mine, sam bennett.

1214
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,105
This is my husband
Sir John Ashwood.

1215
01:01:50,856 --> 01:01:53,023
How do you do?

1216
01:01:54,773 --> 01:01:59,398
Oh, well, that was
Silly of me, wasn't it?

1217
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:01,400
Trying to rush you
On board like that.

1218
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:06,317
Married, huh? Well, what do
You know? Congratulations!

1219
01:02:06,401 --> 01:02:07,817
I hope you'll
Be very happy.

1220
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:09,901
I hope you'll be as
Happy as all get out.

1221
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,818
Not in the army,
Are you?

1222
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:15,986
As a matter of fact, I am, and the
Adjutant tells me my regiment's-

1223
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,445
Soon, John?

1224
01:02:17,528 --> 01:02:19,736
I'm afraid sue picked a bad
Moment to marry an englishman.

1225
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,778
I guess she picked
A good man at that.

1226
01:02:22,863 --> 01:02:24,821
But, well,
It's too bad.

1227
01:02:24,863 --> 01:02:26,780
All the luck
In the world!

1228
01:02:26,863 --> 01:02:28,238
Thanks.

1229
01:02:28,322 --> 01:02:31,280
I guess I'm just in the way
Here. I better get going.

1230
01:02:31,323 --> 01:02:32,823
No need to tell you
How I feel.

1231
01:02:32,906 --> 01:02:35,531
Good-bye, sam.
I'll write to you.

1232
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:40,115
Oh, gee, thanks!

1233
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,117
Thanks!

1234
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,325
Thanks.

1235
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:46,534
Oh, boy!

1236
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:17,790
What about all this mail for
The third king's fusiliers?

1237
01:03:17,832 --> 01:03:18,748
Hold.

1238
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:19,749
Been holding for weeks.

1239
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:20,749
So have they.

1240
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:22,416
In a spot, aren't they?

1241
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:28,251
John dearest,
It is nearly 3 weeks

1242
01:03:28,335 --> 01:03:30,210
Since your last letter came.

1243
01:03:30,293 --> 01:03:33,251
No letter
For your mother, either.

1244
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:36,253
Nothing from you,
Nothing from reggie.

1245
01:03:36,336 --> 01:03:41,795
We know you must have written.
You're so good about writing.

1246
01:03:41,837 --> 01:03:48,255
We try not to worry, to think of all
The reasons there must be for the delay.

1247
01:03:48,297 --> 01:03:52,006
Your mother is braver
Than I am, I'm afraid.

1248
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:56,007
A letter is
A little piece of you.

1249
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:59,507
Without it,
I feel so much alone.

1250
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:06,008
I miss you so. I hardly knew you,
Darling, before you went away.

1251
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:09,926
God keep you safe.
I love you so.

1252
01:04:14,302 --> 01:04:15,718
Hello, davis.

1253
01:04:15,803 --> 01:04:17,386
Hello, sir.

1254
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:20,929
Reggie? Reggie!

1255
01:04:33,765 --> 01:04:36,223
Are the telephone
Lines still out?

1256
01:04:36,265 --> 01:04:37,890
Yes.

1257
01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:40,724
The runner get back?

1258
01:04:40,766 --> 01:04:42,391
No.

1259
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:45,684
We just hang on.

1260
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:51,226
Those are the orders. Position
Must be held at all costs.

1261
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,726
At all costs.

1262
01:04:52,811 --> 01:04:56,270
Well, here's to
The last battalion.

1263
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:01,686
I suppose they'll be
Coming in for the kill soon.

1264
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:03,896
Take it easy, davis.

1265
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:48,584
Nothing?

1266
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:50,084
Nothing.

1267
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:51,751
It's been 5 weeks.

1268
01:06:53,252 --> 01:06:56,544
I don't think we
Should worry, sue, dear.

1269
01:06:56,628 --> 01:06:58,086
Remember
Last spring?

1270
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:00,045
We heard nothing for nearly two months.

1271
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:01,629
Yes. I'd forgotten.

1272
01:07:01,712 --> 01:07:03,670
You look tired.

1273
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:06,587
I didn't sleep
Very well.

1274
01:07:06,672 --> 01:07:08,797
I know. I saw a light
In your window.

1275
01:07:10,172 --> 01:07:15,548
Were you awake?

1276
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:18,299
About 4:00.
What woke you?

1277
01:07:19,591 --> 01:07:22,758
I don't know.
I was dreaming, I think.

1278
01:07:25,092 --> 01:07:28,967
Sue, you're not more
Anxious than usual, are you?

1279
01:07:29,051 --> 01:07:31,968
Oh, no. Why should I be?

1280
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:36,511
Don't worry, darling. We've
Been through all this before,

1281
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,553
Then we've gotten several
Letters all at one time.

1282
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:41,554
You're a great comfort
To me, sue, dear.

1283
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:44,054
When I remember
How badly we started-

1284
01:07:44,138 --> 01:07:46,680
Well, we know each other
Better now.

1285
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:54,056
If I could only see him.
I love him so unreasonably.

1286
01:07:54,098 --> 01:07:55,514
I know, dear.

1287
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,016
Sometimes I'm afraid
If I lose him,

1288
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:01,974
I won't be able
To remember,

1289
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:04,558
Hold on to all the things
I loved in him.

1290
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,892
I'll lose him dead
As I lost him living.

1291
01:08:06,976 --> 01:08:10,560
Sue, don't talk
Like that.

1292
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:13,143
You're killing him
With words.

1293
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:18,478
John's coming home.
Peace will come.

1294
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,437
You'll have years
Together.

1295
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:21,562
Am I intruding?

1296
01:08:21,646 --> 01:08:23,646
No, no, nanny.
Come in.

1297
01:08:25,563 --> 01:08:27,480
I only wanted
To show you this.

1298
01:08:27,564 --> 01:08:29,439
It caught my eye this minute
- here in this corner.

1299
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,439
Look. The government
Is to allow the wives

1300
01:08:31,523 --> 01:08:33,481
Of men who have not had
Leave since last autumn

1301
01:08:33,565 --> 01:08:35,482
To go to france
To meet them.

1302
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:36,940
Let me see.

1303
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:39,024
The first bit of sense
They've shown-

1304
01:08:39,066 --> 01:08:40,524
The blithering old idiots.

1305
01:08:40,566 --> 01:08:42,024
Why, if this is so-

1306
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:44,484
And now you haven't
An excuse in the world.

1307
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:46,983
Dear knows, it's time
You put a baby in my arms.

1308
01:08:47,026 --> 01:08:48,526
Oh, nanny, really!

1309
01:08:48,568 --> 01:08:50,443
They have now completed
All necessary arrangements.

1310
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:51,985
It's rather wonderful, isn't it?

1311
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,485
Yes. We'd better look
Into it right away.

1312
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:57,486
We'll telephone uncle
Henry at the war office.

1313
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,779
And take a word from me to master John
That I am expecting him to do his duty

1314
01:09:00,862 --> 01:09:03,987
And not be sending you back
With things otherwise this time.

1315
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:06,488
Poor little mite
- he'll be half a foreigner at best.

1316
01:09:06,572 --> 01:09:09,906
And it's a queer sort of country
That says it's too proud to fight.

1317
01:09:09,947 --> 01:09:13,030
What do you mean?
You get out of here.

1318
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:16,031
You'll find out whether
We're too proud to fight.

1319
01:09:16,074 --> 01:09:18,032
Imagine the government
Having a heart.

1320
01:09:18,074 --> 01:09:19,741
Course, there'll be thousands
Of wives wanting to go,

1321
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:23,366
But how wonderful to have something
To look forward to, to plan for!

1322
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:27,867
To plan for.
Ha ha ha!

1323
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:32,494
Are you crazy, man? Standing
There with the door wide open,

1324
01:09:32,577 --> 01:09:34,494
With the draft blowing
Right up to the attics?

1325
01:09:34,578 --> 01:09:35,994
There's
A telegraph boy.

1326
01:09:36,078 --> 01:09:37,453
Here it is,
Sir.

1327
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:38,744
Thanks, mate.

1328
01:09:38,787 --> 01:09:40,162
It's a fine
Morning.

1329
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:41,745
'Tis that.

1330
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:45,996
,

1331
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,705
For her?

1332
01:09:48,872 --> 01:09:51,539
It might be
One of them was hurt.

1333
01:09:51,581 --> 01:09:54,206
Yes. Will you
Give it to her?

1334
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,290
If I must.

1335
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:03,208
Surely she'll not
Be called upon to-

1336
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:14,919
I'll have to
Wait my turn,

1337
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:16,920
But it may not
Be too long.

1338
01:10:17,003 --> 01:10:19,420
I must write John
And tell him.

1339
01:10:21,046 --> 01:10:22,879
What is it, nanny?

1340
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:27,129
It's a telegram.

1341
01:10:28,547 --> 01:10:30,964
Shall I read it
To you?

1342
01:10:31,006 --> 01:10:32,464
No.

1343
01:10:32,506 --> 01:10:34,673
Give it to me.

1344
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,972
It's not John.

1345
01:11:12,681 --> 01:11:14,681
Not John.

1346
01:11:16,599 --> 01:11:18,391
Reggie.

1347
01:11:21,933 --> 01:11:24,308
He died heroically.

1348
01:11:24,392 --> 01:11:29,434
Oh, I'm so sorry...
So sorry.

1349
01:11:30,477 --> 01:11:32,602
It's all right.

1350
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:37,103
Sue, you must go
To John.

1351
01:11:37,186 --> 01:11:39,894
You must go
To John at once.

1352
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:45,105
Oh, how good you are.
How good you are.

1353
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:54,106
And now, my dear, I
Think I'll go to my room.

1354
01:12:06,443 --> 01:12:07,901
Porter, pouvez-vous
Me dire si le train-

1355
01:12:07,943 --> 01:12:09,401
The train's late,
Isn't it?

1356
01:12:09,485 --> 01:12:10,901
When do you
Suppose it-

1357
01:12:11,902 --> 01:12:13,360
It signaled,
Didn't it?

1358
01:12:13,402 --> 01:12:15,027
Thank you.

1359
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,285
Hotel
Normandie?

1360
01:12:55,328 --> 01:12:57,328
Hotel normandie.

1361
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:58,828
Sue.

1362
01:12:58,912 --> 01:12:59,828
John, darling.

1363
01:12:59,912 --> 01:13:01,745
Darling.

1364
01:13:01,787 --> 01:13:03,328
Hotel normandie.

1365
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:06,788
Oh, you've changed.
You're so thin.

1366
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:08,372
Hotel normandie.

1367
01:13:08,455 --> 01:13:09,871
I'm so happy.

1368
01:13:09,914 --> 01:13:11,789
Very good hotel.
Many english.

1369
01:13:11,873 --> 01:13:15,790
Let me look at you. You're
So beautiful. I'd forgotten.

1370
01:13:15,874 --> 01:13:17,249
And what a lovely hat.

1371
01:13:17,332 --> 01:13:18,873
You like it?

1372
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:22,792
Hotel normandie
- prix tres raisonnable, cuisine excellente.

1373
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:26,125
Oh, this is my batman
Jennings.

1374
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,792
How do you do,
Jennings?

1375
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:29,292
You must excuse me.

1376
01:13:29,335 --> 01:13:31,543
I know my husband
Thinks the world of you.

1377
01:13:31,627 --> 01:13:33,168
Thank you,
My lady.

1378
01:13:33,252 --> 01:13:37,294
Hotel normandie
- sur la plage, tarifs tres moderes, madame.

1379
01:13:37,336 --> 01:13:39,586
I'm sorry.
I have rooms.

1380
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:42,171
Nous sommes au prince
De galles. Je regrette.

1381
01:13:42,254 --> 01:13:44,754
Mol aussi, madame.
Infiniment.

1382
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:46,754
Hotel normandie!

1383
01:13:49,881 --> 01:13:51,297
You don't know
How wonderful it is

1384
01:13:51,381 --> 01:13:54,798
To be able to open my eyes
And find you still there.

1385
01:13:54,882 --> 01:13:59,257
You see, all these months, I've
Had to close my eyes to see you.

1386
01:13:59,341 --> 01:14:01,799
There'd you be
In some crazy little hat,

1387
01:14:01,842 --> 01:14:04,175
And then somebody would say,
"pardon me, sir,"

1388
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:07,300
And I'd open my eyes,
And bang! You'd be gone.

1389
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,760
Oh, my love, none of that.

1390
01:14:09,802 --> 01:14:12,760
I can't help it. I've
Just got to brim over.

1391
01:14:12,802 --> 01:14:14,302
It's so wonderful.

1392
01:14:15,303 --> 01:14:17,595
You are here at last.

1393
01:14:17,678 --> 01:14:20,261
Madame has been all
Impatience, but now...

1394
01:14:20,304 --> 01:14:22,012
Madame is all tears.

1395
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:25,096
But of course. Que
Voulez-vous? She's so happy.

1396
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:37,766
You like the rooms?

1397
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,182
Perfect.

1398
01:14:40,808 --> 01:14:44,433
Oh, it's the band.
Come and see the view.

1399
01:14:46,309 --> 01:14:48,226
Oh, what gorgeous
Weather-

1400
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,768
More like june
Than april.

1401
01:14:50,852 --> 01:14:53,519
Isn't that a cute
Little bandstand?

1402
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:06,187
That's a cute
Little bandmaster.

1403
01:15:08,314 --> 01:15:12,189
It's the mustache
That gets me.

1404
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:15,648
Dear, are you going to cry
The whole time I'm here?

1405
01:15:15,732 --> 01:15:17,315
I think so.

1406
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:25,609
Thanks.
Merci.

1407
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,192
Merci, monsieur.

1408
01:15:27,276 --> 01:15:28,692
Jennings, go and amuse yourself.

1409
01:15:28,776 --> 01:15:30,693
I don't want to
See you again.

1410
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,360
Very good, sir.

1411
01:15:51,573 --> 01:15:56,907
Oh, sue, my darling, I
Simply can't believe it.

1412
01:15:58,783 --> 01:16:01,200
You're not going
To cry again?

1413
01:16:01,283 --> 01:16:03,200
Yes, I am. I am.

1414
01:16:03,284 --> 01:16:05,409
It's so perfect.

1415
01:16:12,202 --> 01:16:17,036
Oh, darling, you don't
Know what it means.

1416
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:22,579
It's been
Almost 3 years now-

1417
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:28,622
3 years without peace of mind,
3 years of being afraid.

1418
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:32,456
Now to have you,
To know you're safe-

1419
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:36,790
For these few days at least,
To know you're safe.

1420
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:41,625
For the first time,
I dare to be happy.

1421
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,708
I'm going to be very
Happy these few days.

1422
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:48,834
I'm going to hoard up
Every moment.

1423
01:16:50,168 --> 01:16:52,043
I know...

1424
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:56,127
As though it had to last us
For the rest of our lives.

1425
01:17:03,296 --> 01:17:05,629
I've dreamed of this
A hundred times.

1426
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:08,130
Tackle the champagne,
Will you, darling?

1427
01:17:08,214 --> 01:17:09,630
With enthusiasm.

1428
01:17:09,714 --> 01:17:13,589
I think it's grand that you
And mother hit it off so well.

1429
01:17:13,632 --> 01:17:15,090
Does nanny
Bully you?

1430
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:18,090
Does she? To hear her,
You'd think I was doing it

1431
01:17:18,132 --> 01:17:20,049
Just to be contrary
Because I'm an american.

1432
01:17:20,133 --> 01:17:21,549
Doing what?

1433
01:17:21,591 --> 01:17:23,549
Well, I should say
Not doing it.

1434
01:17:23,634 --> 01:17:25,050
Not doing what?

1435
01:17:25,134 --> 01:17:26,050
Well-

1436
01:17:26,134 --> 01:17:28,259
Sue, you're
Blushing.

1437
01:17:30,093 --> 01:17:32,176
You look a little pink
Yourself.

1438
01:17:34,636 --> 01:17:36,094
Well, I know nanny,

1439
01:17:36,136 --> 01:17:40,053
And it'd be just like
Her confounded nerve to-

1440
01:17:40,137 --> 01:17:42,429
It wouldn't have anything to
Do with young percy, would it?

1441
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:44,263
Why, John.

1442
01:17:47,138 --> 01:17:48,471
Percy?

1443
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:52,389
The eldest son is always
Called percy, dear.

1444
01:17:52,473 --> 01:17:54,640
Not my eldest.

1445
01:17:54,723 --> 01:17:56,056
Our eldest.

1446
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,640
But I don't like
The name percy.

1447
01:17:57,724 --> 01:17:59,682
I don't care very much
For it myself,

1448
01:17:59,724 --> 01:18:01,682
But the eldest son
Is always called percy.

1449
01:18:01,725 --> 01:18:03,016
Why?

1450
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,558
It's a family tradition.

1451
01:18:04,642 --> 01:18:08,309
But I want him called John,
After you.

1452
01:18:10,643 --> 01:18:13,977
That's very sweet of you,
Darling, but the eldest is...

1453
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:15,519
Always called percy.

1454
01:18:15,603 --> 01:18:17,520
The eldest is
Always called percy.

1455
01:18:17,603 --> 01:18:20,520
Of course, I don't want to ask
To call him hiram after my father-

1456
01:18:20,604 --> 01:18:23,979
How is your father? What
Do you hear from him?

1457
01:18:24,063 --> 01:18:26,521
You wouldn't be changing
The subject, would you?

1458
01:18:26,563 --> 01:18:28,521
Oh, father's all right,
Cocksure as ever.

1459
01:18:28,564 --> 01:18:29,980
Want some bread?

1460
01:18:30,064 --> 01:18:31,522
The paper doing all right? Quite.

1461
01:18:31,564 --> 01:18:33,731
What does he say about things over here?

1462
01:18:33,815 --> 01:18:37,024
Father says germany better
Stop pushing our ships around,

1463
01:18:37,066 --> 01:18:38,691
Or she's going to get into
Trouble with the tolliver sun.

1464
01:18:38,774 --> 01:18:40,691
Getting his dander
Up, eh?

1465
01:18:40,775 --> 01:18:43,025
Oh, John, I want
America to come in.

1466
01:18:43,108 --> 01:18:46,025
I want it terribly.
I pray for it every night.

1467
01:18:46,109 --> 01:18:49,026
I want this war to end, and
They can help so much to end it.

1468
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:50,485
I want you home again.

1469
01:18:50,568 --> 01:18:52,026
Darling.

1470
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:54,527
Father says I want to plunge
The whole united states into war

1471
01:18:54,611 --> 01:18:56,986
Just to save
One englishman.

1472
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:59,987
Sounds a bit
Drastic, doesn't it?

1473
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,528
Champagne for you,
My girl.

1474
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,529
Right.

1475
01:19:03,571 --> 01:19:05,738
Here's to peacetime.

1476
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:19,866
How lucky we are-

1477
01:19:19,949 --> 01:19:24,033
Bright sun in the day
And such a perfect night.

1478
01:19:24,117 --> 01:19:25,992
But how fast the days go.

1479
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:28,826
I want to hang on
To the hours a bit.

1480
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:31,493
Only 4 days
And one gone already.

1481
01:19:33,077 --> 01:19:35,494
Where's that music
Coming from?

1482
01:19:35,578 --> 01:19:42,204
I don't know... But it's
Just right, isn't it?

1483
01:19:44,538 --> 01:19:46,246
Perfect.

1484
01:19:47,622 --> 01:19:50,497
We heard the sea murmur,

1485
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:53,039
We saw the full moon wane,

1486
01:19:53,123 --> 01:19:57,540
Knowing that our happiness
Might never come again.

1487
01:19:57,624 --> 01:20:02,041
I, not forgetting
Till death do us part,

1488
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:07,251
Was outrageously happy
With death in my heart.

1489
01:20:10,085 --> 01:20:12,460
What are you
Thinking of?

1490
01:20:12,544 --> 01:20:14,336
Of us.

1491
01:21:10,556 --> 01:21:12,598
Monsieur left his pipe.

1492
01:21:13,973 --> 01:21:15,890
Oh, what a pity.

1493
01:21:15,932 --> 01:21:19,432
We were rather rushed
At the last.

1494
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:23,391
And the train was
Perhaps late, after all?

1495
01:21:23,475 --> 01:21:26,433
No. The train was
Very punctual.

1496
01:21:26,518 --> 01:21:30,893
When it came in, I waited
For him nearly an hour,

1497
01:21:30,977 --> 01:21:34,894
But this morning, the train
Went out right on time.

1498
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:36,936
And madame's boat
Leave tonight?

1499
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,437
Yes, this evening.

1500
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:41,937
It's a long wait.

1501
01:21:41,979 --> 01:21:43,437
Madame is sad.

1502
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:47,896
But these were good
Days. Monsieur was so gay.

1503
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:49,939
He laughed so much.

1504
01:21:49,981 --> 01:21:53,398
They were wonderful days. I
Shall remember them all my life.

1505
01:21:53,481 --> 01:21:56,064
And he will come
Again.

1506
01:21:57,441 --> 01:22:00,441
Can I do anything
For madame?

1507
01:22:00,525 --> 01:22:02,650
No, thank you, dear.

1508
01:22:06,526 --> 01:22:11,068
Madame has not noticed that monsieur
Left a note on the mantelpiece.

1509
01:22:34,448 --> 01:22:38,073
Oh, John. John!

1510
01:23:06,955 --> 01:23:09,330
What is it?
What is it?

1511
01:23:09,372 --> 01:23:11,122
What's happened?

1512
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:17,331
Yes.

1513
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,292
I don't understand
A word.

1514
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:29,793
America
Has declared war!

1515
01:23:29,835 --> 01:23:31,752
It's official,
Madame!

1516
01:23:31,794 --> 01:23:33,794
America has
Declared war!

1517
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,670
Rockets' red glare

1518
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:44,004
Gave proof through the night

1519
01:23:44,046 --> 01:23:48,713
That our flag
Was still there

1520
01:23:48,755 --> 01:23:57,673
Oh, say, does that
Star-spangled banner yet wave

1521
01:23:57,757 --> 01:24:02,674
O'er the land of the free

1522
01:24:02,758 --> 01:24:18,803
And the home of the brave?

1523
01:24:26,222 --> 01:24:27,638
Lady Ashwood, sir.

1524
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,763
There you are!
And none too soon.

1525
01:24:29,847 --> 01:24:33,222
What a time we've had. The
Train was late. How are you?

1526
01:24:33,306 --> 01:24:34,722
You're looking well.

1527
01:24:34,807 --> 01:24:37,224
Where's my young friend?
You haven't come alone?

1528
01:24:37,307 --> 01:24:39,224
Certainly not.
Here he is.

1529
01:24:39,266 --> 01:24:40,057
Ah, nanny.

1530
01:24:40,808 --> 01:24:44,267
John Ashwood, esquire.

1531
01:24:45,267 --> 01:24:47,392
Oh! So that's
John's boy, eh?

1532
01:24:47,434 --> 01:24:50,309
And mine.
And mine, colonel.

1533
01:24:50,393 --> 01:24:54,727
He's a fine lad.
He looks like John.

1534
01:24:54,769 --> 01:24:57,727
You know, mrs. Bland,
If it hadn't been for me-

1535
01:24:57,812 --> 01:25:01,271
I have a bit of a share
In this young fellow.

1536
01:25:01,354 --> 01:25:03,229
You cut things
Pretty fine.

1537
01:25:03,313 --> 01:25:05,771
You have no idea
Of the crowds in the street.

1538
01:25:05,813 --> 01:25:08,271
The cab simply crawled. We had
To fight our way across the curb.

1539
01:25:08,314 --> 01:25:10,147
They nearly tore
The child from my arms.

1540
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:13,147
They're coming!
The yanks are coming!

1541
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:17,981
Mrs. Banks, they're
Coming! The yanks are coming!

1542
01:25:18,066 --> 01:25:19,191
Listen.

1543
01:25:20,775 --> 01:25:22,233
They are coming.

1544
01:25:22,275 --> 01:25:24,733
Oh, I could faint
With excitement!

1545
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:26,733
No point in that.
Look here.

1546
01:25:26,776 --> 01:25:30,693
But I've waited so long for this
- to see them myself.

1547
01:25:30,735 --> 01:25:35,194
Listen to the music.
It's so american, that song-

1548
01:25:35,278 --> 01:25:38,195
So gay and aggressive
And boastful!

1549
01:25:38,278 --> 01:25:42,195
There they come!
Nanny? Nanny.

1550
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:44,154
Give him to me.

1551
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:46,196
Be careful,
My lady.

1552
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,738
Look, young man, look.

1553
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:03,367
Those are
Your mother's people.

1554
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,867
See how well they march.

1555
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:11,160
Your mother's people and yours,
Too, because you're half a yankee,

1556
01:26:11,244 --> 01:26:13,286
You little englishman, and I'm
Never going to let you forget it.

1557
01:26:21,704 --> 01:26:25,121
Wave your hand, johnny.
Wave your hand.

1558
01:26:25,205 --> 01:26:28,664
This is your first glimpse
Of history.

1559
01:26:28,747 --> 01:26:32,164
Look, darling,
They're right underneath.

1560
01:26:32,248 --> 01:26:36,040
Look how beautiful they are.

1561
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:49,000
They'll help bring us
Peace, darling.

1562
01:26:49,043 --> 01:26:55,127
They'll bring daddy home again-
Home to see his son.

1563
01:27:13,465 --> 01:27:17,382
Here, I want you to send
These to your father.

1564
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:19,133
The chessmen.

1565
01:27:19,174 --> 01:27:22,549
I thought it might give him some pleasure
To return them to the white house.

1566
01:27:22,633 --> 01:27:25,591
It's a small return
For what they've sent to us,

1567
01:27:25,676 --> 01:27:28,051
But it'll please the
Pig-headed old mule, anyway.

1568
01:27:28,135 --> 01:27:29,760
You darling.

1569
01:27:51,473 --> 01:27:53,390
Hello? Hello?

1570
01:27:53,473 --> 01:27:57,390
Ashwood? He's at
The manor house?

1571
01:27:57,474 --> 01:27:58,890
Who's speaking?

1572
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:03,433
I can't hear you.
There's an infernal racket here.

1573
01:28:03,475 --> 01:28:07,434
Oh, nanny! Nanny, have
You heard the news?

1574
01:28:07,476 --> 01:28:10,101
Oh, you have.

1575
01:28:10,143 --> 01:28:14,060
Pity. I thought I'd be
The first to tell you.

1576
01:28:14,102 --> 01:28:17,060
Armistice, yes.
It's wonderful, isn't it?

1577
01:28:17,103 --> 01:28:19,020
Peace again.

1578
01:28:19,062 --> 01:28:23,562
You should hear the bells.
The town's gone mad.

1579
01:28:23,604 --> 01:28:25,521
You can't blame them.

1580
01:28:25,605 --> 01:28:29,522
She must be delighted, eh?
Let me speak to her.

1581
01:28:29,606 --> 01:28:31,022
Lady Ashwood.

1582
01:28:31,106 --> 01:28:34,731
What? I can't hear you.
Speak up!

1583
01:28:37,607 --> 01:28:41,566
Huh? John?

1584
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:44,066
Dead?

1585
01:28:44,109 --> 01:28:50,360
Killed in action.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1586
01:28:50,402 --> 01:28:52,069
,

1587
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,360
Poor souls.

1588
01:28:56,986 --> 01:28:58,027
I do not remember

1589
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,528
The words that they said.

1590
01:28:59,612 --> 01:29:05,029
Killed, doual, november.
I knew John was dead.

1591
01:29:05,113 --> 01:29:09,030
All done and over,
That day long ago,

1592
01:29:09,114 --> 01:29:13,823
The white cliffs of dover.
Little did I know.

1593
01:29:28,618 --> 01:29:31,535
Sue, I brought you
A little broth.

1594
01:29:31,619 --> 01:29:34,036
You must take
Something.

1595
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,535
Please, dear.

1596
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:38,036
You can't go on
Like this.

1597
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,078
You make me
Very anxious.

1598
01:29:40,162 --> 01:29:42,870
I've left you
Alone all day.

1599
01:29:42,954 --> 01:29:45,079
Won't you make
An effort?

1600
01:29:51,123 --> 01:29:53,581
Susan, you're
Showing no courage.

1601
01:29:53,623 --> 01:29:55,581
One has to go on.

1602
01:29:55,624 --> 01:29:57,416
You're not alone,
You know.

1603
01:29:57,499 --> 01:29:59,582
You're one
Of thousands.

1604
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:02,916
It's my loss, too.

1605
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:04,625
You have your son,

1606
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:06,542
And when
He grows older,

1607
01:30:06,584 --> 01:30:09,209
You'll know just
How much that means.

1608
01:30:09,251 --> 01:30:11,668
I knew John
As a little boy.

1609
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:13,502
I watched him
Grow up.

1610
01:30:13,586 --> 01:30:15,503
He was
Part of my life

1611
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:17,502
From the hour
He was born

1612
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:19,503
Of my hopes
And dreams.

1613
01:30:19,545 --> 01:30:22,337
I died a little
With each of them.

1614
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:27,463
Sue, sue, darling,
You must face it.

1615
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,464
Think of him.

1616
01:30:29,547 --> 01:30:31,464
You're
Shutting him out.

1617
01:30:31,548 --> 01:30:35,048
Oh, darling, can't you
Cry a little for John

1618
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:37,465
Because he's dead
So young?

1619
01:30:37,549 --> 01:30:39,507
He'll
Never come home,

1620
01:30:39,549 --> 01:30:41,507
Although
Peace has come.

1621
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:44,300
He'll never see
His little boy.

1622
01:30:44,384 --> 01:30:46,009
,

1623
01:30:49,551 --> 01:30:51,509
Well, here's
The young gentleman

1624
01:30:51,552 --> 01:30:53,510
To say good night
To his mammy,

1625
01:30:53,594 --> 01:30:56,052
And a very sleepy
Young gentleman it is.

1626
01:30:57,637 --> 01:31:00,512
He didn't sleep so well
After his 4:00 bottle.

1627
01:31:00,595 --> 01:31:03,470
I think that tooth's
Worrying him a wee bit,

1628
01:31:03,554 --> 01:31:05,512
But he's
Such a good baby.

1629
01:31:05,596 --> 01:31:08,471
Aren't you the best baby
In all the world?

1630
01:31:08,555 --> 01:31:10,930
Come, now. Say good night to your mammy,

1631
01:31:11,014 --> 01:31:13,431
And off we go
To the sack.

1632
01:31:13,515 --> 01:31:15,390
There we are.
Ho ho!

1633
01:31:15,474 --> 01:31:17,932
Look at the fat
Legs on him.

1634
01:31:18,016 --> 01:31:20,933
I declare, I never saw
A baby grow so fast.

1635
01:31:21,016 --> 01:31:23,933
Why, that little blue coat
You bought for him in august

1636
01:31:24,017 --> 01:31:26,475
Is too short in
The sleeves already.

1637
01:31:26,518 --> 01:31:29,310
And strong. Feel
The strength of him.

1638
01:31:29,351 --> 01:31:33,476
Yes, he's fine
And strong-my baby.

1639
01:31:33,519 --> 01:31:35,936
He'll grow up
Tall and straight,

1640
01:31:35,978 --> 01:31:38,436
And he'll go
Into the army.

1641
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,437
The eldest son always
Goes into the army.

1642
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:43,188
It's a family tradition.

1643
01:31:43,271 --> 01:31:44,437
Sue, dear-

1644
01:31:44,521 --> 01:31:47,438
A tradition to die young
In a country not your own-

1645
01:31:47,522 --> 01:31:48,605
Please, darling.

1646
01:31:48,689 --> 01:31:50,606
For honor and glory.

1647
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:53,689
No, I haven't any glory
Now, have I?

1648
01:31:53,773 --> 01:31:55,440
They took that, too.

1649
01:31:55,524 --> 01:31:58,441
They took it all
Away from me.

1650
01:31:58,524 --> 01:32:00,441
They took...

1651
01:32:00,525 --> 01:32:03,984
But he'll live out his life.
I'll teach him to do that.

1652
01:32:04,025 --> 01:32:06,942
I'll teach him to run and hide
When the drums start playing.

1653
01:32:06,984 --> 01:32:09,151
I'll take care of him.
I'll keep him safe.

1654
01:32:09,235 --> 01:32:12,110
I don't care how. I'll keep
Him safe. You understand?

1655
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:13,235
Now, me lady-

1656
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:14,860
He's mine.
He belongs to me.

1657
01:32:14,944 --> 01:32:16,902
They shan't have him.
They shan't take him

1658
01:32:16,945 --> 01:32:18,903
Because he's young and strong
And kill him, never.

1659
01:32:18,945 --> 01:32:20,403
Never! Never!

1660
01:32:21,612 --> 01:32:24,070
Darling, please. You're
Frightening the baby.

1661
01:32:24,113 --> 01:32:26,530
You don't know
What you're saying.

1662
01:32:26,572 --> 01:32:29,530
We have peace.
John died for that.

1663
01:32:29,572 --> 01:32:31,530
We've learned
A dreadful lesson.

1664
01:32:31,614 --> 01:32:34,031
We know now
What war means.

1665
01:32:34,073 --> 01:32:35,531
We're all losers,

1666
01:32:35,615 --> 01:32:37,573
And we've all
Suffered so much

1667
01:32:37,657 --> 01:32:39,865
That good
Must come of it.

1668
01:32:39,949 --> 01:32:42,907
Your boy will grow up in a new world.

1669
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:45,908
There'll be no shadow
Of war over his youth.

1670
01:32:45,951 --> 01:32:48,034
John gave his life
For that.

1671
01:32:48,118 --> 01:32:50,785
You must believe
That, darling.

1672
01:32:50,868 --> 01:32:53,243
It wasn't
A vain sacrifice.

1673
01:32:53,286 --> 01:32:57,161
John gave his life so
That his son should live.

1674
01:33:35,378 --> 01:33:37,336
But the years pass,

1675
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:38,836
And the heart mends,

1676
01:33:38,878 --> 01:33:40,836
And life takes up
Its quiet labor.

1677
01:33:40,879 --> 01:33:43,337
The bee returns
To the meadow clover,

1678
01:33:43,421 --> 01:33:46,838
And the tree grows
As the child grows.

1679
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,339
I saw his father
Over and over.

1680
01:33:50,423 --> 01:33:53,298
His face looked out
Of my son's face-

1681
01:33:53,381 --> 01:33:56,840
His father's smile,
His father's pose.

1682
01:33:56,924 --> 01:33:59,841
I watched him
With his boyhood friends.

1683
01:33:59,924 --> 01:34:03,508
I watched him with his friends
And neighbors.

1684
01:34:07,426 --> 01:34:09,343
Good day, Betsy.

1685
01:34:09,385 --> 01:34:11,593
Good day,
Sir John.

1686
01:34:11,677 --> 01:34:14,552
I was just looking
At your roof.

1687
01:34:14,636 --> 01:34:17,803
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1688
01:34:23,346 --> 01:34:25,763
Well, as long
As I'm here,

1689
01:34:25,805 --> 01:34:28,472
I think I'll take
A look around.

1690
01:34:28,514 --> 01:34:31,139
A very good idea,
Sir John.

1691
01:34:36,182 --> 01:34:37,765
That's quite all right,
Mrs. Kenney.

1692
01:34:37,807 --> 01:34:39,724
We can't have the rain
Coming in, can we?

1693
01:34:39,808 --> 01:34:42,266
No, that we can't, but I'm
Sorry it had to be done now,

1694
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:43,766
Times as they are.

1695
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:46,267
Ben was saying it's worse
For you than it is for us.

1696
01:34:46,351 --> 01:34:48,309
We are a bit hard up.
Income tax, you know.

1697
01:34:48,351 --> 01:34:52,060
6 shillings on the pound, and next
Year they say it's going to be worse,

1698
01:34:52,144 --> 01:34:53,811
But it's improving
The economic structure.

1699
01:34:53,852 --> 01:34:55,769
We've had to sell
Quite a bit of land,

1700
01:34:55,811 --> 01:34:57,728
And my grandmother doesn't
Like that very much.

1701
01:34:57,812 --> 01:34:59,812
And how is
Her poor ladyship?

1702
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:02,312
Granny's a little bit
Better, thank you.

1703
01:35:02,354 --> 01:35:04,271
I think
I better go now.

1704
01:35:04,313 --> 01:35:06,271
I've got 2 or 3
Things to do.

1705
01:35:06,355 --> 01:35:07,771
Good-bye,
Mrs. Kenney.

1706
01:35:07,855 --> 01:35:09,271
Good-bye,
Sir John.

1707
01:35:09,314 --> 01:35:10,730
Good-bye, Betsy.

1708
01:35:10,773 --> 01:35:11,856
Good-bye.

1709
01:35:15,732 --> 01:35:17,148
Good-bye, Betsy.

1710
01:35:17,232 --> 01:35:19,774
Good-bye, sir John.

1711
01:35:38,112 --> 01:35:41,237
Mother, I stopped in at the
Kenneys' today about the roof.

1712
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:43,737
Did you, darling?
And how's Betsy?

1713
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:46,737
Oh, all right,
I expect.

1714
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:50,239
Mother, I promised the
Trotters a new fence.

1715
01:35:50,281 --> 01:35:53,239
Oh, John, dear, you must be more careful

1716
01:35:53,323 --> 01:35:54,739
About promising
Things.

1717
01:35:54,823 --> 01:35:57,198
We can't even afford
To mend our own fences.

1718
01:35:57,282 --> 01:36:00,240
I know, mother. I explained
To them about the taxes,

1719
01:36:00,325 --> 01:36:03,700
But somehow their cow
Got into the pettys' backyard.

1720
01:36:03,784 --> 01:36:06,742
It upset the beehive
And got terribly badly stung,

1721
01:36:06,826 --> 01:36:08,701
Wouldn't give milk
For days,

1722
01:36:08,785 --> 01:36:11,160
And you know they've
Just got a new baby.

1723
01:36:11,244 --> 01:36:12,702
Uh, sir John...

1724
01:36:12,785 --> 01:36:15,660
Come here.
Do you mind?

1725
01:36:15,744 --> 01:36:17,661
You're, uh...

1726
01:36:17,745 --> 01:36:20,620
You were deucedly important
This afternoon, sir John.

1727
01:36:20,704 --> 01:36:22,120
Yes, sir.

1728
01:36:22,204 --> 01:36:26,121
Yes, a real high-toned member of
The stranded gentry, aren't you?

1729
01:36:26,205 --> 01:36:27,705
Yes, sir.

1730
01:36:27,747 --> 01:36:30,705
Yes, your great- great-grandfather
On your mother's side

1731
01:36:30,748 --> 01:36:34,207
Kept a little dry goods store
In tolliver. Did you know that?

1732
01:36:34,248 --> 01:36:35,706
Yes.

1733
01:36:38,708 --> 01:36:41,000
Did you sleep well
Last night, sir?

1734
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:42,166
Did you?

1735
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:43,666
Not at first, sir.

1736
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:46,458
You see, somebody placed
A very cold frog in my bed.

1737
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:47,626
John!

1738
01:36:47,709 --> 01:36:50,292
Well, now, that's
A strange coincidence.

1739
01:36:50,335 --> 01:36:52,627
Somebody sewed up
The legs of my pajamas

1740
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:54,918
And put a hairbrush
In the pillow.

1741
01:36:54,961 --> 01:36:56,836
Yes, sir.
I did, sir.

1742
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:59,462
It's known as an apple pie bed, sir.

1743
01:36:59,545 --> 01:37:01,712
It's a custom
In english schools,

1744
01:37:01,754 --> 01:37:03,629
And I know that you're
Always so interested

1745
01:37:03,713 --> 01:37:05,880
In our english
Customs, sir.

1746
01:37:07,839 --> 01:37:08,839
You rascal!

1747
01:37:10,256 --> 01:37:12,798
Oh, father. It's
No wonder nanny scolds you.

1748
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,256
Fix your hair,
Johnny.

1749
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:17,298
Mother, can I go down and
See what bridget has for tea?

1750
01:37:17,341 --> 01:37:18,966
Why? You want
Something special?

1751
01:37:19,008 --> 01:37:21,591
Yes. You see, mother, I've
Invited those two german boys

1752
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:23,592
That are staying
With old Lady berdale.

1753
01:37:23,634 --> 01:37:25,634
Yes, rustle up
Some crumpets.

1754
01:37:28,135 --> 01:37:30,593
Darn little limey.

1755
01:37:30,677 --> 01:37:32,635
Yes.

1756
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,511
Germans, eh?

1757
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,303
Darling,
This is nice.

1758
01:37:41,387 --> 01:37:43,137
Are you sure
You should risk it?

1759
01:37:43,179 --> 01:37:44,971
Yes, it's
A bit crisp today.

1760
01:37:45,013 --> 01:37:47,096
Of course it is, but
It's no use arguing with her.

1761
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:48,805
She always thinks
She knows best.

1762
01:37:48,847 --> 01:37:50,639
I heard that we
Had some young guests,

1763
01:37:50,681 --> 01:37:52,306
So I couldn't resist
The temptation.

1764
01:37:52,348 --> 01:37:53,223
These are John's friends

1765
01:37:53,223 --> 01:37:54,973
Gerhard von vistaberg
And his brother dietrich.

1766
01:37:55,015 --> 01:37:56,807
How do you do?

1767
01:37:56,849 --> 01:37:58,140
How do you do?

1768
01:37:58,182 --> 01:38:00,099
Are you the sons of
The baron von vistaberg

1769
01:38:00,183 --> 01:38:01,766
Who was secretary at the german embassy

1770
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,308
Some years ago?

1771
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,100
No, Lady Jean. The embassy counselor
Was of the linden vistabergs.

1772
01:38:06,184 --> 01:38:08,142
We are
The oak vistabergs.

1773
01:38:08,226 --> 01:38:12,060
We have an oak leaf
In our coat of arms.

1774
01:38:12,144 --> 01:38:14,061
What do you have
In yours, grandfather?

1775
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,227
A pipe, a smelly
Old tobacco pipe,

1776
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:18,062
And maybe
A deck of cards.

1777
01:38:18,145 --> 01:38:19,895
I could suggest
A proper animal

1778
01:38:19,979 --> 01:38:21,687
For your coat
Of arms, hiram.

1779
01:38:21,771 --> 01:38:22,729
Yes?

1780
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:23,688
A mule.

1781
01:38:23,771 --> 01:38:25,729
A mule? Ha ha!
Why not?

1782
01:38:25,813 --> 01:38:27,688
It's not an aristocratic animal,

1783
01:38:27,772 --> 01:38:29,730
But it knows
Its way around,

1784
01:38:29,814 --> 01:38:32,564
And it packs a healthy
Wallop in its hind legs.

1785
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,023
Very useful qualities, my dear Jean.

1786
01:38:35,107 --> 01:38:37,565
Perhaps you're
Right, hiram.

1787
01:38:37,607 --> 01:38:40,565
Anyhow, unicorns are
Out of date nowadays.

1788
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:44,067
Nothing is out of date
When one loves it.

1789
01:38:44,109 --> 01:38:45,567
Thank you, hiram.

1790
01:38:45,651 --> 01:38:47,568
Are you enjoying
Your stay

1791
01:38:47,651 --> 01:38:49,734
In england,
Herr von vistaberg?

1792
01:38:49,818 --> 01:38:51,526
What is it
You enjoy most here?

1793
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:53,235
That's hard to say,
Lady Jean.

1794
01:38:53,319 --> 01:38:54,860
We've not seen
Much of london,

1795
01:38:54,944 --> 01:38:56,569
But here
In the country,

1796
01:38:56,653 --> 01:38:58,278
I admire most
The beautiful lawns

1797
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,237
One finds around almost
Every manor house.

1798
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,070
Your lawn is one
Of the most perfect.

1799
01:39:02,154 --> 01:39:03,862
It would make an
Excellent landing field.

1800
01:39:03,946 --> 01:39:06,571
I suppose it
Needs centuries of tending.

1801
01:39:06,613 --> 01:39:08,696
Landing field, dietrich?
For what?

1802
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:12,197
For troops. They could easily
Land in gliders on this lawn.

1803
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,740
Oh, you mean
Airborne troops

1804
01:39:15,824 --> 01:39:17,741
Could land here during maneuvers.

1805
01:39:17,824 --> 01:39:19,949
During maneuvers,
Of course, sir.

1806
01:39:20,033 --> 01:39:22,325
Yes. Of course.

1807
01:39:22,408 --> 01:39:25,075
Boys of dietrich's age
Learn about planes and gliders

1808
01:39:25,159 --> 01:39:26,575
In their youth
Organizations,

1809
01:39:26,659 --> 01:39:28,576
So of course
They think of nothing

1810
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,535
But landing fields
And such things.

1811
01:39:30,618 --> 01:39:32,576
All we learn in
School is latin and greek.

1812
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,577
I wish they'd teach us
Something about planes.

1813
01:39:34,661 --> 01:39:36,494
It's only natural that
Gerhard and dietrich

1814
01:39:36,578 --> 01:39:38,578
Should be interested
In military matters.

1815
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,578
When I traveled
In germany,

1816
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:43,078
I drove by the vistaberg
Armament plants.

1817
01:39:43,121 --> 01:39:44,579
Very impressive,
Too.

1818
01:39:44,621 --> 01:39:46,788
Took me almost an hour to pass them,

1819
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:48,747
And all the chimneys
Were smoking.

1820
01:39:48,831 --> 01:39:50,748
Of course, they
Weren't making arms.

1821
01:39:50,789 --> 01:39:52,747
That was prohibited
By the peace terms.

1822
01:39:52,831 --> 01:39:54,581
Exactly. Under
Existing restrictions,

1823
01:39:54,665 --> 01:39:57,582
The vistaberg plants produce
Nothing but kitchen utensils,

1824
01:39:57,666 --> 01:40:00,583
Perambulators, gramophones,
Agricultural implements,

1825
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:02,082
Cameras, and so on.

1826
01:40:02,167 --> 01:40:04,542
Don't forget the
Vacuum cleaners, gerhard.

1827
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:06,375
When father
Gave us the list,

1828
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:09,167
He told us especially not to
Forget the vacuum cleaners.

1829
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:11,127
Vacuum cleaners
And perambulators-

1830
01:40:11,168 --> 01:40:14,126
A smiling country given
To ways of peace.

1831
01:40:14,169 --> 01:40:16,961
Babies and cleanliness
- I like that.

1832
01:40:17,045 --> 01:40:19,545
That makes me
Very happy.

1833
01:40:19,629 --> 01:40:21,546
Yes, they've learned
Their lesson.

1834
01:40:21,587 --> 01:40:23,504
Germany has learned
Her lesson.

1835
01:40:23,588 --> 01:40:25,046
A beaten country-

1836
01:40:25,088 --> 01:40:26,880
I beg your pardon, sir!

1837
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:31,381
Yes, gerhard?

1838
01:40:38,091 --> 01:40:40,008
Germany was
Never beaten.

1839
01:40:40,091 --> 01:40:42,008
We never accepted
The peace,

1840
01:40:42,092 --> 01:40:43,759
And we never shall.

1841
01:40:43,842 --> 01:40:46,300
The war was
Not fought to a finish.

1842
01:40:46,384 --> 01:40:48,967
The next time, we shall
Not be cheated of victory.

1843
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:51,968
We shall be proud and happy
To die on the field of honor.

1844
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:03,929
Yes, well, if you boys are going to
Play tennis, you'd better get going.

1845
01:41:04,013 --> 01:41:06,055
Yes, sir.

1846
01:41:06,097 --> 01:41:08,180
Come, dietrich.

1847
01:41:13,515 --> 01:41:16,974
Lady Jean,
Lady ashford,

1848
01:41:17,016 --> 01:41:19,974
I did not mean
To offend you.

1849
01:41:20,016 --> 01:41:21,474
You understand, I-

1850
01:41:21,516 --> 01:41:23,474
That's
All right, my boy.

1851
01:41:23,517 --> 01:41:25,642
Go and have
A good time.

1852
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:31,435
Mother, do you want
Me to play with them?

1853
01:41:31,477 --> 01:41:32,977
Yes, John.

1854
01:41:33,061 --> 01:41:35,019
They are
Your guests.

1855
01:41:40,145 --> 01:41:42,937
Out of the mouths
Of babes.

1856
01:41:43,021 --> 01:41:45,479
That was rather frightening, wasn't it?

1857
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:46,937
Oh, here's
Nanny.

1858
01:41:47,022 --> 01:41:49,480
I think perhaps I'll rest a little.

1859
01:41:49,522 --> 01:41:51,147
Mother, don't you
Feel well?

1860
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:52,605
Nothing.
It's nothing, dear.

1861
01:41:52,648 --> 01:41:54,273
I'm all right.
I'm a little tired.

1862
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:55,606
Indeed you are.

1863
01:41:55,649 --> 01:41:57,482
I said it would be too much
For you coming downstairs,

1864
01:41:57,524 --> 01:41:59,857
But nobody ever
Listens to me.

1865
01:42:02,025 --> 01:42:04,942
That was a strange
Outbreak, father, wasn't it?

1866
01:42:06,526 --> 01:42:07,984
No.

1867
01:42:08,068 --> 01:42:11,402
Susan, I know that as
Long as Jean is here,

1868
01:42:11,485 --> 01:42:14,402
You'd never leave, and
I wouldn't want you to,

1869
01:42:14,444 --> 01:42:16,402
But someday
I'd like to think

1870
01:42:16,486 --> 01:42:20,403
That you'd come back home
To me and bring the boy.

1871
01:42:20,487 --> 01:42:22,904
Why, father?
What are you thinking?

1872
01:42:22,988 --> 01:42:25,863
Well, I'm thinking that
We might lose him...

1873
01:42:25,947 --> 01:42:28,364
The same way
We lost his father.

1874
01:42:28,447 --> 01:42:30,905
It isn't only what
These boys said.

1875
01:42:30,989 --> 01:42:33,406
I've felt it
For a long while.

1876
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:35,448
I can tell you
Honestly, susan,

1877
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:37,448
There's another war
In the making.

1878
01:42:37,491 --> 01:42:41,283
It may come in 5 years.
It may come in 10.

1879
01:42:41,325 --> 01:42:43,950
But it's as
Inevitable as death.

1880
01:42:50,327 --> 01:42:51,743
Master John.

1881
01:42:51,827 --> 01:42:53,243
Johnny.

1882
01:42:53,327 --> 01:42:55,410
Wake up,
Master John.

1883
01:42:55,494 --> 01:42:57,411
Nanny.

1884
01:42:57,495 --> 01:42:59,203
Nanny, it's still dark.

1885
01:42:59,287 --> 01:43:00,912
Yes. I know it.

1886
01:43:00,996 --> 01:43:02,579
It's 2:00
In the morning.

1887
01:43:02,663 --> 01:43:04,246
Your granny's
Asking for you.

1888
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,413
Granny?

1889
01:43:05,496 --> 01:43:08,454
She's had a bad spell. She's very weak.

1890
01:43:08,497 --> 01:43:10,872
Is... Is
The doctor here?

1891
01:43:10,956 --> 01:43:13,206
He's on his way.

1892
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:14,831
Nanny...

1893
01:43:14,915 --> 01:43:16,540
Is she very ill?

1894
01:43:16,582 --> 01:43:18,374
She is that,

1895
01:43:18,416 --> 01:43:20,374
And she's going,
Laddie,

1896
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:21,874
But you
Mustn't cry.

1897
01:43:21,917 --> 01:43:24,375
You must be very brave and strong.

1898
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:26,042
Promise me.

1899
01:43:36,753 --> 01:43:38,836
Are you ready,
Johnny?

1900
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,545
Yes, nanny.

1901
01:44:11,844 --> 01:44:12,802
The car is here,
My lady.

1902
01:44:12,844 --> 01:44:13,969
Thank you,
Benson.

1903
01:44:14,011 --> 01:44:15,136
Where's
Grandfather?

1904
01:44:15,219 --> 01:44:16,635
He's saying
Good-bye to nanny.

1905
01:44:16,678 --> 01:44:18,178
May I help?

1906
01:44:23,929 --> 01:44:27,804
Oh, is the car here?
I'm ready.

1907
01:44:27,889 --> 01:44:30,806
My, this seems a great big empty place

1908
01:44:30,889 --> 01:44:32,305
Now that
She's gone.

1909
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:33,806
God bless her.

1910
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:36,307
I never thought I'd miss her so much.

1911
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:39,307
Think of what I said
About coming home, susan.

1912
01:44:39,349 --> 01:44:40,765
Car's here,
Grandfather.

1913
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:41,933
Everything's
Stowed.

1914
01:44:42,017 --> 01:44:43,684
Ah, that's fine.

1915
01:44:45,017 --> 01:44:48,476
Well, you're not going
To like this, young fella,

1916
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,810
But I'm going to
Give you one big hug.

1917
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:53,310
Ha ha ha!

1918
01:44:53,394 --> 01:44:56,394
Yeah. You tell your mother
To bring you to america,

1919
01:44:56,436 --> 01:44:59,269
And I'll make you sports editor
Of the tolliver sun.

1920
01:44:59,354 --> 01:45:01,771
I'm sorry, sir. I'm
Afraid I couldn't do that.

1921
01:45:01,854 --> 01:45:03,812
I have to go into my father's regiment.

1922
01:45:03,896 --> 01:45:06,313
The eldest son always
Goes in the army, you know.

1923
01:45:06,397 --> 01:45:09,314
Yes. If you change your mind,
You just let me know.

1924
01:45:09,397 --> 01:45:10,730
Yes, sir.

1925
01:45:10,814 --> 01:45:13,231
Ha ha! Well,
Good-bye, suzie.

1926
01:45:13,315 --> 01:45:15,732
I'll be waiting
For a letter from you.

1927
01:45:15,815 --> 01:45:17,231
Good-bye.

1928
01:45:17,316 --> 01:45:18,691
Take care
Of yourself.

1929
01:45:18,774 --> 01:45:19,982
Yes, suzie.

1930
01:45:20,025 --> 01:45:22,067
And now,
If you don't mind,

1931
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:24,233
I'd like to do
The driving.

1932
01:45:27,318 --> 01:45:29,235
May I remind you,
Sir,

1933
01:45:29,276 --> 01:45:32,276
That in england one drives
On the left side of the road?

1934
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:35,277
I know, I know. Darn
Foolishness. See you soon.

1935
01:45:35,319 --> 01:45:36,944
Bye-bye.

1936
01:45:41,321 --> 01:45:42,737
Is he coming back soon?

1937
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:44,737
No. He meant-

1938
01:45:44,821 --> 01:45:47,571
I'll tell you later
What he meant.

1939
01:45:52,490 --> 01:45:54,073
Sir John!

1940
01:45:59,658 --> 01:46:01,241
Good morning,
Sir John.

1941
01:46:01,325 --> 01:46:03,617
Good morning, sir John.

1942
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:05,784
Good morning. I've
Come to say good-bye.

1943
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:07,409
We're sailing tomorrow, you know.

1944
01:46:07,451 --> 01:46:08,617
Aye.
So we've heard.

1945
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,118
It be true, then.

1946
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,202
I wouldn't believe it till I
Heard it from your own lips.

1947
01:46:12,244 --> 01:46:14,244
Ben was saying you'd
Never leave england.

1948
01:46:14,286 --> 01:46:15,536
You see, my mother's american,

1949
01:46:15,578 --> 01:46:16,869
And it's
Only natural

1950
01:46:16,911 --> 01:46:18,578
That she'd want to
Live in her own country.

1951
01:46:18,662 --> 01:46:20,537
We'll be a-missing
You, sir John.

1952
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:23,204
We'll all be a
- missing you. You know, sir John,

1953
01:46:23,246 --> 01:46:25,704
Us kenneys have rented
This farm from your family

1954
01:46:25,747 --> 01:46:27,914
For nigh on 200 year.

1955
01:46:27,997 --> 01:46:29,538
Adam steele's going to be my land agent,

1956
01:46:29,622 --> 01:46:31,122
And he's
A good man.

1957
01:46:31,164 --> 01:46:33,997
He'll be a good man, sir
John, but it ain't the same.

1958
01:46:34,082 --> 01:46:36,082
No,
It's not the same.

1959
01:46:36,124 --> 01:46:37,707
Well...

1960
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:39,207
I'll say
Good-bye.

1961
01:46:39,291 --> 01:46:40,707
Good-bye,
Mrs. Kenney.

1962
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:42,166
Good-bye, sir John.

1963
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:43,708
Good-bye,
Mr. Kenney.

1964
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:45,250
Good-bye,
Sir John.

1965
01:46:46,418 --> 01:46:48,126
Good-bye, Betsy.

1966
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:49,543
Good-bye.

1967
01:47:01,129 --> 01:47:03,212
Betsy.

1968
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,630
Betsy...

1969
01:47:09,714 --> 01:47:11,464
It's for you.

1970
01:47:12,965 --> 01:47:15,298
What is it?

1971
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:16,798
It's a ring.

1972
01:47:16,882 --> 01:47:19,632
I made it out of a
Horseshoe nail of midge's.

1973
01:47:19,716 --> 01:47:21,257
You can have it.

1974
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,092
A horseshoe nail.

1975
01:47:24,175 --> 01:47:26,675
It's for good luck.

1976
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:31,385
Ohh.

1977
01:47:34,219 --> 01:47:35,969
Good-bye.

1978
01:47:36,886 --> 01:47:39,678
Good-bye, John.

1979
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,387
Thank you
For the ring.

1980
01:48:06,893 --> 01:48:08,851
Will you like it, nanny,
Living with your sister?

1981
01:48:08,893 --> 01:48:10,268
I'll get used to it.

1982
01:48:10,352 --> 01:48:11,768
Is she nice?

1983
01:48:11,852 --> 01:48:15,436
I hardly know. I've lived
In this house for 50 years.

1984
01:48:15,478 --> 01:48:19,103
It's been home and family
To me. I've forgotten my own.

1985
01:48:19,145 --> 01:48:22,770
Master johnny!
Look away. Gracious me.

1986
01:48:26,813 --> 01:48:29,938
There. Now I'm ready.

1987
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:36,732
You're awfully
Like your father

1988
01:48:36,774 --> 01:48:39,066
At the same age,
Master johnny.

1989
01:48:39,149 --> 01:48:43,066
You'll be the living image
Of him when you grow up.

1990
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:45,275
Well, I'll be off.

1991
01:48:50,443 --> 01:48:54,902
Laddie, will you say good-bye
To me here and let me go alone?

1992
01:48:54,986 --> 01:48:57,403
I'll send that lazy jenny
For my things.

1993
01:48:58,987 --> 01:49:01,904
I'm afraid I'll break down
Like an old fool,

1994
01:49:01,946 --> 01:49:07,405
And I'll not let everyone in the
Kitchen see me with tears in my eyes.

1995
01:49:07,489 --> 01:49:09,072
My johnny...

1996
01:49:09,156 --> 01:49:10,989
Don't you forget.

1997
01:49:11,073 --> 01:49:12,948
I won't forget, nanny.

1998
01:49:13,073 --> 01:49:14,573
Good-bye.

1999
01:49:14,657 --> 01:49:17,615
Indeed, if I had my life
To live over again,

2000
01:49:17,699 --> 01:49:19,782
It's not
A child's nurse I'd be,

2001
01:49:19,866 --> 01:49:21,908
Giving my heart to other
People's children and...

2002
01:49:21,992 --> 01:49:23,617
Old and lonely.

2003
01:49:23,659 --> 01:49:25,909
No more.

2004
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:50,289
Aren't you thrilled going on
A big boat for the first time?

2005
01:49:50,372 --> 01:49:51,747
Oh, it'll be
Wonderful.

2006
01:49:51,831 --> 01:49:53,289
Did I tell you
Grandfather

2007
01:49:53,373 --> 01:49:55,790
Was going to
Meet us in new york?

2008
01:49:55,832 --> 01:49:58,290
I expect he's terribly excited about it.

2009
01:49:58,332 --> 01:50:00,790
I know I am.
Are you, mother?

2010
01:50:00,833 --> 01:50:03,250
Mm-hmm. After all,
That's my home, you know.

2011
01:50:03,334 --> 01:50:05,751
I can hardly wait to
Show you the sights.

2012
01:50:05,792 --> 01:50:07,792
You're going to
Love it, darling.

2013
01:50:07,834 --> 01:50:09,834
I'm sure
It'll be very nice.

2014
01:50:11,627 --> 01:50:14,877
Mother, if that man
Buys the manor,

2015
01:50:14,919 --> 01:50:18,711
Do you think he'll be
Good to the tenants?

2016
01:50:18,753 --> 01:50:21,045
I don't know
Why not.

2017
01:50:21,129 --> 01:50:23,546
Granny said that the tenants
Depended on the manor.

2018
01:50:23,629 --> 01:50:26,546
She said it was my duty
To watch over them

2019
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:28,630
In return for the privilege
Of owning land.

2020
01:50:28,672 --> 01:50:30,672
I don't say that's
Wrong, darling,

2021
01:50:30,714 --> 01:50:34,173
But we look at things a
Little differently at home.

2022
01:50:34,257 --> 01:50:35,882
At home, mother?

2023
01:50:35,965 --> 01:50:38,340
Well, in america,
I mean.

2024
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:41,174
You see, we think a man ought
To start from the beginning,

2025
01:50:41,258 --> 01:50:43,466
That he ought to make
His own way in the world.

2026
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:46,884
Yes, but supposing he has
Something else to do first.

2027
01:50:46,926 --> 01:50:48,384
What do you mean,
Dear?

2028
01:50:48,426 --> 01:50:51,259
I mean, supposing he's
Been left something to do,

2029
01:50:51,302 --> 01:50:52,802
As I was.

2030
01:50:52,886 --> 01:50:54,386
As you were?

2031
01:50:54,469 --> 01:50:56,719
Yes. I mean, the way
Father left me

2032
01:50:56,803 --> 01:50:59,053
You and the place
To look after.

2033
01:50:59,137 --> 01:51:00,553
Oh.

2034
01:51:00,637 --> 01:51:02,387
Well, I don't know,
Johnny.

2035
01:51:02,471 --> 01:51:07,888
Wouldn't a chap want to do it just
The same if he were an american?

2036
01:51:07,972 --> 01:51:09,388
I guess he would.

2037
01:51:09,472 --> 01:51:10,888
That's all I mean.

2038
01:51:10,973 --> 01:51:13,973
It isn't so very different over
There than it is here, is it?

2039
01:51:14,057 --> 01:51:17,099
You just try and do the thing
That's there for you to do.

2040
01:51:17,141 --> 01:51:20,600
Johnny, don't you want to go to america?

2041
01:51:20,641 --> 01:51:23,558
Oh, yes, mother...
If you do.

2042
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,600
No, no.
Tell me the truth.

2043
01:51:25,642 --> 01:51:28,100
What are you thinking of,
Sitting there so serious?

2044
01:51:28,185 --> 01:51:29,560
I wouldn't
For the world

2045
01:51:29,643 --> 01:51:32,101
Force you to do something
You thought was wrong,

2046
01:51:32,185 --> 01:51:35,060
But I do wish you could
See it my way, darling.

2047
01:51:35,144 --> 01:51:36,602
I want it so much.

2048
01:51:36,686 --> 01:51:38,686
Why, mother?
Because I'm afraid.

2049
01:51:38,728 --> 01:51:40,561
I'm afraid
Of what's ahead.

2050
01:51:40,645 --> 01:51:42,687
I'm afraid
Of another war.

2051
01:51:42,771 --> 01:51:45,146
Your father died
When he was young.

2052
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:46,646
He died for england,
Johnny.

2053
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:49,146
But you're half american. You're my son.

2054
01:51:49,231 --> 01:51:51,648
You belong to america,
Too, not only england.

2055
01:51:51,689 --> 01:51:54,106
Mother, is that why
We're running away?

2056
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:55,606
Running away?

2057
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:59,399
Mother, if there were a war,
I'd want to fight for england.

2058
01:51:59,441 --> 01:52:03,191
You wouldn't want me to
Be a coward, would you?

2059
01:52:03,234 --> 01:52:05,192
No, johnny.

2060
01:52:05,234 --> 01:52:07,192
Mother.

2061
01:52:07,234 --> 01:52:09,192
Yes?

2062
01:52:09,235 --> 01:52:12,944
Do you think father
Would like me to run away?

2063
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:18,444
No, johnny, I don't.

2064
01:52:18,487 --> 01:52:20,112
Mother.

2065
01:52:20,154 --> 01:52:23,488
You darn
Little englishman.

2066
01:52:23,529 --> 01:52:25,946
You're just
Like your father.

2067
01:52:25,988 --> 01:52:29,280
You've beaten me,
Between the two of you.

2068
01:52:29,322 --> 01:52:32,114
Mother, do you mind
Very much?

2069
01:52:32,156 --> 01:52:33,739
Of course I mind.

2070
01:52:33,823 --> 01:52:36,573
When I see
That boat go out,

2071
01:52:36,657 --> 01:52:38,949
Playing the star-spangled banner...

2072
01:52:40,325 --> 01:52:44,450
No. That's
Not sporting of me.

2073
01:52:44,534 --> 01:52:46,951
I'll stay, johnny,
And like it.

2074
01:52:47,034 --> 01:52:49,451
Whatever happens,
We'll face it together.

2075
01:52:49,535 --> 01:52:52,452
Your american mother
Can take it, too.

2076
01:52:52,494 --> 01:52:54,161
You bet she can.

2077
01:52:59,287 --> 01:53:01,704
I wanted to go home then,

2078
01:53:01,787 --> 01:53:04,704
But your father
Took me by the arm,

2079
01:53:04,788 --> 01:53:06,663
Talking the most
Dreadful nonsense,

2080
01:53:06,747 --> 01:53:11,664
Led me up a flight of steps,
Over a bridge, across the tracks,

2081
01:53:11,748 --> 01:53:15,873
Down the steps that led
To the london train.

2082
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:20,208
I guess you can
Find the way.

2083
01:53:23,292 --> 01:53:25,209
Mother?

2084
01:53:25,292 --> 01:53:27,167
Yes, child?

2085
01:53:27,251 --> 01:53:31,210
You're the best mother a chap ever had.

2086
01:53:31,294 --> 01:53:33,211
Thank you, dear.

2087
01:53:42,421 --> 01:53:44,421
So we went home again.

2088
01:53:44,463 --> 01:53:48,422
My english son did all those
Things that all his sires had done.

2089
01:53:48,464 --> 01:53:51,881
No one had taught him,
Yet he knew his part.

2090
01:53:51,964 --> 01:53:55,381
The land itself
Was teeter to his heart.

2091
01:53:55,465 --> 01:53:59,382
He watched his fields,
He kept his father's place,

2092
01:53:59,466 --> 01:54:03,341
A friendly boy
With england in his face,

2093
01:54:03,384 --> 01:54:06,718
And often when he walked
Across our hill,

2094
01:54:06,801 --> 01:54:09,968
Betsy went walking, too,
As children will,

2095
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:13,219
To gather flowers
With her homework done,

2096
01:54:13,302 --> 01:54:16,344
And so they walked
Together in the sun.

2097
01:54:16,428 --> 01:54:19,845
If they were more than friends,
I never knew,

2098
01:54:19,929 --> 01:54:23,346
For a new spirit
Shaped him as he grew.

2099
01:54:23,388 --> 01:54:26,305
There was a different england
In the air.

2100
01:54:26,388 --> 01:54:30,847
I liked the girl.
They made a handsome pair.

2101
01:54:30,931 --> 01:54:34,348
And so I watched them
And was reconciled.

2102
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:38,807
He was my son, as well
As england's child.

2103
01:54:38,891 --> 01:54:41,141
Eton, then sandhurst,

2104
01:54:41,183 --> 01:54:44,975
And, of course, at last
His father's regiment.

2105
01:54:45,059 --> 01:54:47,559
The die was cast.

2106
01:54:49,435 --> 01:54:52,352
And then to see
In anguish and in doubt

2107
01:54:52,435 --> 01:54:54,852
The lights of europe
Falter and go out,

2108
01:54:54,894 --> 01:54:57,352
And once again the feet
Of marching men

2109
01:54:57,395 --> 01:55:00,854
Drum in the dust and darkness,
Once again.

2110
01:55:00,896 --> 01:55:03,854
Rumors of battles.
Headlines in the street.

2111
01:55:03,896 --> 01:55:06,354
Holland and france.
The desperate retreat.

2112
01:55:06,397 --> 01:55:09,689
Our days were busy
With a thousand cares.

2113
01:55:09,772 --> 01:55:14,147
Our nights were dark and quiet
With our prayers.

2114
01:55:15,357 --> 01:55:18,274
He came from somewhere
In the west that day,

2115
01:55:18,316 --> 01:55:20,774
Heading for dover
And the waiting ships.

2116
01:55:20,858 --> 01:55:24,275
So little time,
With silence on his lips.

2117
01:55:24,359 --> 01:55:27,776
I did not see my son
As he went through.

2118
01:55:27,818 --> 01:55:29,943
I thought him far away.

2119
01:55:30,027 --> 01:55:31,819
But Betsy knew.

2120
01:55:33,194 --> 01:55:35,944
Have you called
Your mother?

2121
01:55:36,028 --> 01:55:39,445
No. I thought
I wouldn't somehow.

2122
01:55:39,529 --> 01:55:42,487
Johnny, have we
Much time?

2123
01:55:47,489 --> 01:55:49,489
Not much, Betsy.

2124
01:55:52,698 --> 01:55:54,656
Make sure...

2125
01:56:02,033 --> 01:56:03,950
The old horseshoe ring.

2126
01:56:04,034 --> 01:56:06,451
It brought me
Luck, johnny,

2127
01:56:06,534 --> 01:56:08,451
But-but now I-

2128
01:56:08,535 --> 01:56:10,368
Do you remember
When we were kids

2129
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:13,869
And I used to ride round,
See you on my pony?

2130
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:16,369
Yes. All you
Ever said was,

2131
01:56:16,453 --> 01:56:18,703
"how's the roof,
Mrs. Kenney?"

2132
01:56:18,787 --> 01:56:22,204
I suppose I did have it
On my mind, rather.

2133
01:56:22,287 --> 01:56:25,245
It seemed to need
Such a lot of mending.

2134
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:27,705
How is it now?
Fallen in again?

2135
01:56:27,789 --> 01:56:30,706
I'm afraid so.

2136
01:56:30,789 --> 01:56:32,414
Oh, johnny.

2137
01:56:32,456 --> 01:56:35,915
Steady.

2138
01:56:37,624 --> 01:56:41,583
And so they
Parted, each to his command.

2139
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:45,000
"the ring," she said
And placed it in his hand

2140
01:56:45,042 --> 01:56:46,875
And watched him go,

2141
01:56:46,959 --> 01:56:49,709
Then turned
To find her train.

2142
01:56:49,793 --> 01:56:53,668
She was not there when
John came home again.

2143
01:56:56,795 --> 01:56:58,378
One moment.

2144
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:07,255
Come in.

2145
01:57:08,797 --> 01:57:12,714
Word's just come in. The
Ambulances are leaving the station.

2146
01:57:12,756 --> 01:57:15,381
Oh, thank you, margaret.
I'll be right down.

2147
01:57:29,843 --> 01:57:31,384
Ward 4.

2148
01:57:36,761 --> 01:57:38,344
Ward 2.

2149
01:57:45,888 --> 01:57:47,429
John.

2150
01:57:53,223 --> 01:57:55,056
Mother?

2151
01:58:04,892 --> 01:58:08,184
This is an emergency. Blood
Is coming through the bandage.

2152
01:58:08,268 --> 01:58:09,976
Call the doctor's
Attention to it.

2153
01:58:10,018 --> 01:58:11,143
Yes, ma'am.

2154
01:58:11,185 --> 01:58:12,435
Ward 3.

2155
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:30,271
How long?

2156
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:45,942
4, perhaps
6 hours.

2157
01:59:09,031 --> 01:59:11,073
Hello.

2158
01:59:11,156 --> 01:59:13,281
I've been asleep.

2159
01:59:13,323 --> 01:59:15,490
How do you feel?

2160
01:59:15,532 --> 01:59:19,449
Not-not bad
At all, mother.

2161
01:59:19,491 --> 01:59:22,950
Did you guess
I was in the show?

2162
01:59:23,033 --> 01:59:24,408
Worry?

2163
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:27,325
What do you think?

2164
01:59:28,701 --> 01:59:31,784
I guess we're lucky.

2165
01:59:31,869 --> 01:59:36,286
You know, mother,
I wasn't afraid, really.

2166
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:38,787
I know.

2167
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:42,287
That-that bird...

2168
01:59:42,371 --> 01:59:44,788
What, dear?

2169
01:59:44,871 --> 01:59:49,330
The bird kept going
Round and round.

2170
01:59:49,372 --> 01:59:50,997
Where, dear?

2171
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:56,457
There was
A little bandstand.

2172
01:59:56,540 --> 02:00:02,457
At first, it seemed like any
Other misty morning in summer-

2173
02:00:02,542 --> 02:00:04,959
Quiet...

2174
02:00:05,042 --> 02:00:08,459
And the air smelled sweet.

2175
02:00:08,543 --> 02:00:11,585
Suddenly,
Everything broke loose.

2176
02:00:13,627 --> 02:00:16,544
The canadians fought
Their way ashore.

2177
02:00:16,628 --> 02:00:18,545
We were among them.

2178
02:00:18,587 --> 02:00:22,087
I- I don't remember
How I got there,

2179
02:00:22,171 --> 02:00:26,296
But I was in a shell hole
With a canadian and american.

2180
02:00:27,464 --> 02:00:30,547
The canadian was dead.

2181
02:00:30,631 --> 02:00:34,090
The american boy
Was wounded pretty badly.

2182
02:00:34,132 --> 02:00:38,841
Only his eyes
Seemed to be alive.

2183
02:00:38,924 --> 02:00:45,050
We lay there with the shells
Screaming over our heads,

2184
02:00:45,092 --> 02:00:48,009
Watching that bird
Spinning insanely

2185
02:00:48,051 --> 02:00:52,718
Over what used to be
That gay little bandstand.

2186
02:00:57,136 --> 02:01:00,761
Mother,
Do you know dieppe?

2187
02:01:00,846 --> 02:01:06,555
Yes. I
- I was there once with your father.

2188
02:01:06,638 --> 02:01:09,013
You remember
That bandstand?

2189
02:01:09,097 --> 02:01:11,014
Yes.

2190
02:01:11,098 --> 02:01:14,223
I remember it
Very well.

2191
02:01:20,058 --> 02:01:21,516
Hello. What's this?

2192
02:01:21,558 --> 02:01:23,141
A little
Nourishment.

2193
02:01:28,601 --> 02:01:31,018
There's a parade
Coming past the hospital

2194
02:01:31,102 --> 02:01:32,518
In a little while.

2195
02:01:32,602 --> 02:01:35,560
Some of those new american
Units, they tell me,

2196
02:01:35,644 --> 02:01:36,977
Along with
Our own boys.

2197
02:01:37,103 --> 02:01:39,520
Would you wheel me
To the window

2198
02:01:39,604 --> 02:01:40,979
When they come?

2199
02:01:41,062 --> 02:01:42,187
Of course.

2200
02:01:42,271 --> 02:01:43,479
Thanks.

2201
02:01:48,439 --> 02:01:51,773
Don't try to talk,
Darling.

2202
02:01:53,398 --> 02:01:57,148
That chap...
That american...

2203
02:01:57,232 --> 02:01:58,648
Yes?

2204
02:01:58,733 --> 02:02:02,192
He said he'd really
Start to fight

2205
02:02:02,233 --> 02:02:04,191
The day war ended...

2206
02:02:04,275 --> 02:02:07,859
For a good peace,
A peace that'd stick.

2207
02:02:15,653 --> 02:02:20,779
He said that god
Would never forgive us,

2208
02:02:20,862 --> 02:02:24,279
Neither england
Nor america,

2209
02:02:24,363 --> 02:02:28,072
If we break the faith
With our dead again.

2210
02:02:29,864 --> 02:02:33,073
Write his mother
A nice letter.

2211
02:02:33,115 --> 02:02:35,990
Tell her that...

2212
02:02:36,032 --> 02:02:39,532
Oh, well, you'll
Think of something.

2213
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:44,658
I say, shouldn't you
Be busy somewhere?

2214
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:47,158
I'm all right,
You know, really.

2215
02:02:47,201 --> 02:02:48,951
I know you are,

2216
02:02:48,993 --> 02:02:51,285
But you must
Rest now.

2217
02:02:51,369 --> 02:02:53,119
In a minute.

2218
02:02:53,161 --> 02:02:55,828
Good night, mother.

2219
02:02:57,203 --> 02:02:59,411
Thanks.

2220
02:02:59,495 --> 02:03:02,453
Good night,
My darling boy,

2221
02:03:02,538 --> 02:03:04,455
And god bless you.

2222
02:03:04,538 --> 02:03:06,371
You, too, mother.

2223
02:03:16,499 --> 02:03:18,416
Here you are, mother.

2224
02:03:18,499 --> 02:03:20,416
They're coming...

2225
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,375
Some of your americans.

2226
02:03:22,458 --> 02:03:26,583
Yes, darling. I saw them
When they came 25 years ago.

2227
02:03:26,626 --> 02:03:28,126
So did you.

2228
02:03:28,168 --> 02:03:29,918
You were
3 months old.

2229
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:34,419
I held you in my arms,
And we saw them together.

2230
02:03:35,961 --> 02:03:39,378
Now we can
See them again.

2231
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:42,128
Tell me how
They look, mother.

2232
02:03:42,212 --> 02:03:44,795
Tell me
How they march.

2233
02:04:07,593 --> 02:04:09,968
Can you see them yet?

2234
02:04:10,052 --> 02:04:12,510
Yes, John,
I see them,

2235
02:04:12,552 --> 02:04:15,052
Your people
And my people.

2236
02:04:15,094 --> 02:04:17,552
Only their uniforms are different.

2237
02:04:17,637 --> 02:04:20,387
How well they
March, John.

2238
02:04:20,429 --> 02:04:22,887
How well they
March together.

2239
02:04:34,515 --> 02:04:36,473
Tell me more, mother.

2240
02:04:36,557 --> 02:04:40,099
There's a look of greatness about them,

2241
02:04:40,141 --> 02:04:42,849
All the strong
Young boys,

2242
02:04:42,933 --> 02:04:45,891
Beautiful and proud with dreams.

2243
02:04:47,268 --> 02:04:49,351
Just like you,
John.

2244
02:04:55,269 --> 02:04:57,852
They'll help
Bring peace again,

2245
02:04:57,937 --> 02:05:03,188
And as your friend said,
A peace that will stick.

2246
02:05:11,439 --> 02:05:13,606
You know,
John...

2247
02:05:13,690 --> 02:05:15,607
We must
Never forget

2248
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:19,107
What that american boy said to you.

2249
02:05:19,191 --> 02:05:21,649
God will never
Forgive us

2250
02:05:21,733 --> 02:05:25,317
If we break the faith
With our dead again.

2251
02:05:26,305 --> 02:06:26,486
