1
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:53,001
I believe the harder
time is to wake up in the morning.

2
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:56,882
Those first moments
before I remember who I am...

3
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:59,311
instead of
remember me...

4
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,126
Who I was.

5
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:04,451
Mother, there is snow
in Mt. Tom.  Will still be there
on the weekend.

6
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:07,048
Do not make me go to school today.

7
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,244
It's the first day of snow.

8
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,214
There is snow on Mount Tom.  
Want to get some more sleep?

9
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:16,359
I can not delay on the first day of class.

10
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:19,311
Everyone will go skiing, except me.

11
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,828
Oh, I wanted to go, too.

12
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:29,174
Get out of here!

13
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:31,370
Mother!

14
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,110
Want to please
find Gary.

15
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:36,636
The reverend called tonight
and said his class...

16
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,089
will be full this year.

17
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,508
Good morning, children.

18
00:01:49,684 --> 00:01:50,885
Good morning.

19
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:55,047
I am Jill Kinmont, your teacher.

20
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:59,622
Good morning.

21
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:05,918
Then my mother puts me in the 
chair in the morning.

22
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:08,715
And I stay all day.

23
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:10,593
Until she takes me out at night.

24
00:02:10,594 --> 00:02:11,954
Do you stay in the chair all day?

25
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:12,722
I stay.

26
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:14,426
Are you never going to the bathroom?

27
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,079
All the time.

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,658
I have a catheter inserted into me.

29
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,947
A probe that stays
inside me...

30
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:23,092
attached to a bag stuck
in my leg.

31
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:27,313
See. Here is the place.

32
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,650
Wow, what a beautiful thing.

33
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,368
What is the best way to fish for trout?

34
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,852
With a harpoon.

35
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,057
Great. How do you
write harpoon?

36
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:41,514
Come on.
You can fish the trout.

37
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:46,529
A-R-P-A-O

38
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,836
It was almost, it was almost certain.

39
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,933
But in the end it is no.

40
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:54,955
Do you know how to write?

41
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:56,808
Edie?

42
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:00,344
- A, til, O.
- Right.

43
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:02,524
So how do you
write harpoon?

44
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:03,916
- Me, me, me!
- Everyone.

45
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,147
A-R-P-Ãƒ-O

46
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:08,976
Right.

47
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,688
No, no one will want to marry you.

48
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:16,958
Do not you?

49
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,878
Of course, she is beautiful.

50
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,316
But she can not dance or anything.

51
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:23,229
Has anyone ever asked you?

52
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,923
- He asked for what?
- In married.

53
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:27,019
- Yes.
- Who?

54
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,513
You do not know.

55
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:31,903
If he asked,
why did not you accept?

56
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:34,007
I always think
I have overcome everything.

57
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:36,395
That no longer hurts me more.

58
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:39,817
Suddenly everything comes back.

59
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:42,540
Here in Bishop, more than
anywhere.

60
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,211
Because here I can raise my eyes 
and see the snow.

61
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:51,296
I am Jill Kinmont
and I am a skier!

62
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:59,398
A WINDOW FOR HEAVEN

63
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,789
Here, look at it here.

64
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,417
The most beautiful thing
that I have ever seen.

65
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:23,429
The fastest skier in the world.

66
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,752
Buek, the crazy dog
is his nickname, because he...

67
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:27,114
is a crazy person.

68
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:28,343
And they say he's trying to kill himself.

69
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,439
- Is it? Well, that's what they say.

70
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,009
What if he dies before we meet him?

71
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:34,020
What if he kills himself before 
joining the team?

72
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:35,458
No you will not.

73
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,438
- And if he dies? We will not know.

74
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,110
- What is this?
- Anything.

75
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,021
Ah, what is this, come on.
Let me see.

76
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,527
- What is this?
- Anything.

77
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:46,777
Girl.

78
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:50,061
Oh, it's Dick Buek. I got a letter 
from him this morning.

79
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,163
Did not you know?

80
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,159
We have corresponded ourselves
for a long time.

81
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,556
He's crazy to meet me
when joining the Olympic team.

82
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:58,344
Of course!

83
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:01,560
But he is too old. 
You must be about 22 years old.

84
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:04,221
Besides, I'm in love with another guy.

85
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:06,560
Oh is it? And who is the lucky one?

86
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,488
James Dean.

87
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:19,007
Attention, I want
all listening.

88
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:21,336
A.J?

89
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,487
We have our
first competition of the year...

90
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,289
this weekend, or next weekend.

91
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,770
In general I take the best
skiers to these races.

92
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:33,347
But this time I decided to take everyone.

93
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,235
Herbie, do you want to stop
with these hands?

94
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,303
I did not do anything.

95
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:44,889
Herbie, take it easy.

96
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:45,968
What did I do wrong?

97
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,522
As if he did not know. 
You do not stop with those hands.

98
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,760
Lie, they're still.

99
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:53,290
It's okay. Can someone change 
place with Gil?

100
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,480
I change.

101
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:55,989
Audra Jo!

102
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,561
- How wonderful!
- Wow!

103
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,183
A.J. return here and
take your skis.

104
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:26,497
Thank you.

105
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:29,731
Herbie.

106
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:32,374
Herbie, tell her to come back
and get the skis.

107
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:35,296
Let's all be together
, okay?

108
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:39,296
As far as I remember,
everything I wanted...

109
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:40,611
It was skiing.

110
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:45,420
It was not just a sport, it was a way of life.

111
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,949
Our coach was
David McCoy.

112
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,412
A former champion who gave
to our Gym the...

113
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,754
team level
first line.

114
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,136
And now the number 74, Boulder.
Colorado.

115
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:10,639
Our most difficult opponent was 
the team from Boulder, Colorado.

116
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:13,967
Led by a real
hall named Buddy Werner.

117
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:32,862
Ready for the start
No. 46 of Bishop, California.

118
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,488
Ten seconds.

119
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:54,594
Skeeter Werner of
Boulder, Colorado with # 6.  One, already!

120
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:57,202
The best
team of Colorado skier was...

121
00:08:57,676 --> 00:09:00,138
Skeeter Werner. And began
a personal war for...

122
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,729
prove which team
was the best.

123
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,164
Paragraph 14, ten seconds.

124
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:07,227
Alda Jo Nicholson,
Bishop, California.

125
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,048
- Five, four...
- Number 14.

126
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,595
Three, two, one, already!

127
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:19,895
This is your second
year of competition.

128
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:22,060
Last year she finished
fourth in the...

129
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,848
Finals in Z'berg, California.

130
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,988
No 89, ready for
the start.

131
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:34,087
At the starting spot,
Jill Kinmont, No. 89.

132
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:36,072
Jill can still reach it.
Skeeter beat me...

133
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:38,410
for only five seconds.

134
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,933
Ten seconds!

135
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,762
Five, four, three,
two, one, already!

136
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:52,658
- Jill goes, goes!
- Go!

137
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,654
Jill Kinmont, No. 89,
Running Incomplete.

138
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:20,774
Beautiful. Do you want me to take 
a picture of you?

139
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,107
I bit my tongue.

140
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:24,411
Who ordered to leave
out in the race?

141
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:25,554
Wonder why
you burned?

142
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,673
My coach will tell me, thank you.

143
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:30,351
Skinny is gravity. 
It's so much more powerful than you.

144
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:32,773
The less you fight it, the faster it will go.

145
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:34,037
Do I know you?

146
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,709
No.
Raises.

147
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,583
What are you, doctor?

148
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:43,276
No. Look, keep your hands right in front of you.

149
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:44,759
What do these initials mean?

150
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,540
That's my name. Bend like this 
and release the body.

151
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,103
Gravity works...
- Mike?

152
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:51,320
Ankles, knee, back
, elbows.

153
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:52,763
Is Melvin? Mark?

154
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,749
Make you
a projectile.

155
00:10:57,881 --> 00:10:59,441
Do you want to learn to
ski or not?

156
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:01,852
Look, I'm sorry. But I do not take ski lessons...

157
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:05,336
with anyone not.

158
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:07,411
I am Jill Kinmont and it happens
that I am the best skier...

159
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,267
My God! It's the crazy dog Buek!

160
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:15,374
We now have the first
placed, Skeeter and Buddy Werner.

161
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:20,055
I had met Dick Buek.

162
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:23,063
And I thought my life would never be the same.

163
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:25,525
But summer has come and
all the fantasies...

164
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,252
they had to be put aside.

165
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:31,663
My family ran
a ranch named Rockin K.

166
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:35,365
And during the summers we all worked on it.

167
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,640
That was it.
- I can not believe.

168
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:44,296
My best friend
was Audra Jo Nicholson.

169
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,326
We were inseparable.

170
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,383
- He is looking at us. Look at his face.

171
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,994
There was nothing we did not 
know about each other.

172
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:03,533
No dream we did not share.

173
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,205
But our biggest dream was skiing.

174
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:09,040
We lived always in the hope
of some day to participate...

175
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,603
Olympic team meetings.

176
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:39,607
Hey, J.
Are you awake?

177
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:41,444
Can I talk to you?

178
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,183
I'm so tired.

179
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:46,521
But you just
will listen.

180
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:49,308
It's okay.

181
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:53,301
I've been thinking about luck.

182
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,358
Why does luck always walk with me?

183
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:06,235
Everything I wanted, I always did.

184
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:09,707
Have you ever felt this?

185
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,379
Once in a while.

186
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,142
E...

187
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,521
I begin to think if...

188
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:26,097
I am not one of those
people who were born with luck.

189
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:30,982
If I'm using all my luck at once.

190
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:38,481
What do you think?

191
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:41,691
I think I'm sick.

192
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:43,538
What happened?

193
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:45,738
I have a horrible headache
.

194
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:52,732
You did not catch the sun
too much A. J.?

195
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:55,068
Want an aspirin?

196
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,386
I already have.

197
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:00,663
It was too much sun
that you took.

198
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,762
Improved?

199
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,388
Continue.

200
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,032
Do not know...

201
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,808
I wonder if...

202
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,746
I'll go back
to see Dick.

203
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,695
What do you think?

204
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:27,455
Jose?

205
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:31,766
A.J? Are you alright?

206
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:35,463
Jose? Are you alright?

207
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:38,670
Guys, call a doctor,
there's something wrong with A. J.!

208
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:46,461
What did the doctor say?

209
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:49,552
I think it would be better
you guys get my car...

210
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,760
And come back, okay?

211
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,388
But what is it?

212
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,974
They think it's polio.

213
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,797
You must go now.

214
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,493
Coach!

215
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:17,698
Can you give her that ring?

216
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:23,027
And tell her that
I love her.

217
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,066
Really.

218
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:02,988
Josie.

219
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,177
We go together
the Olympics.

220
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:08,198
You will be fine.

221
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,894
We go together.

222
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,741
You will be fine.

223
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:17,198
You will be fine, Jose.

224
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,875
You will be fine.

225
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,515
After Jose got sick
I wanted to ski for both of us.

226
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:06,628
And I trained that summer
more than in any other.

227
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:13,232
Is it really him?

228
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:16,013
He is. He landed his
airplane practically...

229
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:18,664
in Dave's backyard. I saw you from the highway.

230
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,413
I thought he was going to fall.

231
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,964
But when I got there - it was coming out of the...

232
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,336
Crutches plane.

233
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,287
Of crutches?

234
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:27,109
I swear to God. 
He was flying the crutch plane.

235
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,836
Why?

236
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,789
The leg, it broke the leg.

237
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:33,746
Did not you know? 
She left in all the magazines.

238
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,251
He was on the
motorcycle at 150.

239
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:38,002
He hit a trailer
of camping and...

240
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,084
flew in through one window and out the other.

241
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,581
They thought she had died
and even covered his face.

242
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:43,766
Have you ever imagined?

243
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,144
He did not know anything.

244
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:47,509
That's what you get
for living in the woods.

245
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,437
You're not kidding me- no, right Linda?

246
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,533
Cheating? I swear. 
Look at his plane, son of a bitch.

247
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:13,253
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

248
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:14,298
What happened?

249
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:21,145
It's just that we were
going to school, so...

250
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:24,535
We decided to give a pass here.

251
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:28,007
And knowing what time will
be the training.

252
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,052
In the usual time.

253
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,399
I did not say that
would be the usual time?

254
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,451
= 15:30.

255
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,729
I do not know why she insisted 
on passing by?

256
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,945
- Hi!
- Excuse.

257
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:42,830
Hi.

258
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,523
- I'm Linda Mayer.
- Hi, beautiful.

259
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,060
I've read a lot about you since 
you started skiing.

260
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:53,074
I wrote you a letter to the hospital.

261
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,978
Ah, this is an old friend of mine.

262
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:59,728
Old friend of mine too.

263
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,250
Do you know her?

264
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,172
Everything that she knows, I taught.

265
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:05,793
Listen to girls, you're not going 
to be late for class, right?

266
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:08,420
Come on Jill, we'll be late.

267
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:10,707
You can go,
find you later.

268
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,612
What story can this be?

269
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:15,222
That you can go.

270
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:25,841
Then...

271
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:28,300
Would not you like to take a walk?

272
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:29,216
Ok.

273
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,055
Do you think she's on the plane with him?

274
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:16,746
It's best to call
David McCoy.

275
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:33,510
- We can cross here. You will not.

276
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,814
Give up to
betting race.

277
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:37,183
Why do you do these things?

278
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:40,849
Do you want to kill yourself?

279
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,880
I've heard of the crazy things you do.

280
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:50,874
Freefall with parachute
found in trash cans.

281
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:54,549
Motorcycle racing
like crazy.

282
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,701
Do not believe everything you say.

283
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,881
- Why, Dick?
- Because what?

284
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:03,750
Why do you want to die?

285
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:06,766
- Are you worried?
- Do not play.

286
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:10,247
I'm wondering.

287
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,863
I do not worry about it.

288
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:25,108
Oh, yes. Here I am.

289
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:27,195
And I am nothing.

290
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,809
I studied until high school.

291
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,321
No thought
important in the head.

292
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:32,621
But I live.

293
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:37,048
No matter what I do,
I end up standing again.

294
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:42,458
I do not know why
good people die.

295
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,697
And I keep living.

296
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:49,229
You are a good person.

297
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,661
Yes it is.

298
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:53,989
And how do you know?

299
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,210
I know I care
with you.

300
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,806
So it should be good.

301
00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:02,797
You find me funny.

302
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,655
I think you're beautiful.

303
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,821
You too.

304
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:12,453
Yes it is.

305
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:29,038
Dick.

306
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,999
Please stay alive.

307
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,387
Winter of 1955.

308
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:08,684
We were there for a
year of the Olympics.

309
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,984
And everyone who wanted to
if they were classified would have...

310
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:13,742
they finish the season
among the first.

311
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:19,042
<i>E at the starting spot,
or No. 32, Allan Freeman.</i>

312
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:22,366
Four, three, two, one, already!

313
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,589
Listen, you can not see it very well.

314
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,774
So then, let go.

315
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:02,628
But be aggressive until
the end, okay?

316
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:04,440
Ten seconds.

317
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:08,173
<i>And with No. 89, Jill Kinmont.</i>

318
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:12,510
Three, two, one, already!

319
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:24,692
As the
dispute escalated...

320
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:26,945
greater was my
determination to win.

321
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:29,215
I won the regional
tournament more trophies...

322
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:31,939
than I had won
in a year.

323
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,314
And No. 89 was beginning to draw attention.

324
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:51,309
Excuse me.

325
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:55,824
- Wow, you were great.
- Thanks.

326
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:58,035
- Let's see what it was...
- Hey Buddy, how about putting...

327
00:25:58,036 --> 00:25:59,481
the arm on her waist?

328
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:00,831
Ask her if
she will leave.

329
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,238
<i>The best was Jill Kinmont.</i>

330
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,778
You leave?

331
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:15,588
In that wonderful year
Buddy Werner has obtained many...

332
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:17,034
victories like me.

333
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,204
And for all the places we were 
going to, we all wanted...

334
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,482
We started dating.

335
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,372
But I kept thinking
in Buek and during...

336
00:26:26,373 --> 00:26:28,577
That winter I searched for him.

337
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,993
- Account for me.
- IT IS.

338
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:52,421
- Is it really?
- Yes.  Look who's here, the Buek.

339
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:01,936
Who is that
blonde with him?

340
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:03,381
Must be someone's daughter.
They say they are engaged.

341
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:08,651
- Hi, how are you? 
You do not want to play a game?

342
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:12,072
- Give it some time. Okay, bye, Dick.

343
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:13,961
Hey, Dick. How did you break your arm?

344
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:18,060
Dancing with a
heavy girl.

345
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:20,135
I know you, do not I?

346
00:27:29,421 --> 00:27:31,120
Yes.

347
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:35,711
- Hello Buddy.
- Hi.

348
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:38,049
I want to introduce you to
you my fiancÃ©e.

349
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:44,444
Hey, Dick Buek! How's it going, man?

350
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:46,392
Are you reminded of Charlie last winter?

351
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:48,975
- Yes, of course. Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

352
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:50,602
Come on, you talk to
these guys later.

353
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:17,206
Hey.

354
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:30,242
If there is anything wrong,
I would like to help.

355
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,532
- Good race!
- Too!

356
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:20,326
Listen, you take it easy
this time.

357
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,633
You're good on the front, right?

358
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,628
So do not try
no record.

359
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,547
And do not forget that
tree, right?

360
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,326
Come on, there. Capriche,
have fun and...

361
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:29,706
Hold the lead.

362
00:29:29,707 --> 00:29:31,191
89, ten seconds.

363
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:35,324
<i>At the starting spot, Jill Kinmont,
With No. 89.</i>

364
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:38,947
- The skier of the year. Four, three, two, one, now!

365
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,723
When the season was
nearing the end.

366
00:29:44,724 --> 00:29:47,893
Buddy and I were invited
to train in a special field.

367
00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:51,324
Preparing us for the last
great race of the year.

368
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:53,064
It was called, snow bowl.

369
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:54,582
And it was held in Alta, Utah.

370
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,914
If I won there, I would be qualified 
for the Olympics.

371
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,428
Come on Jill, stop with the jokes.

372
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:17,122
Jill, let's go back.

373
00:31:17,218 --> 00:31:19,228
Come soon,
let's get down.

374
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:25,383
February 1, 1955.

375
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:29,230
The Snow Bowl would be
within a few days.

376
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:33,137
And the experts bet that we would both win.

377
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:34,656
Will both of you go to the Olympic games together?

378
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:38,217
Have both of you ever fallen in a dispute?

379
00:31:39,752 --> 00:31:41,844
Listen, I'll talk to you later.

380
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:45,097
I get distracted from
_ time to time I fall.

381
00:31:45,098 --> 00:31:46,312
And you think it will be very difficult?

382
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,160
How about competing with
all favorites?

383
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,722
Thanks.

384
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:57,778
- Good luck.
- They are awesome.

385
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:04,184
<i>Flight 32, coming from
Los Angeles, landing...</i>

386
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:06,204
<i>through gate four.</i>

387
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,136
David.

388
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:20,716
And then? Did you have a good trip?

389
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:22,331
She will be doing a lot
well, of course she will leave.

390
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:25,759
This reception was a beauty, was not it?

391
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:35,760
It is divided into three parts.

392
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:38,119
You have to go slowly at first.

393
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:39,827
But it will have to increase
well the speed...

394
00:32:40,145 --> 00:32:41,434
when entering the middle part
.

395
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:43,800
There's the ditch they call a corkscrew.

396
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:45,812
On that side.

397
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:48,727
Then comes a relatively easy
voucher.

398
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:50,238
And already will have arrived.

399
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:52,752
Look, the race will be won
or lost right there.

400
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,212
There in the corkscrew.

401
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:57,094
There is a rise. A steep climb up before him.

402
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:59,089
So if you get into it
too fast, you will...

403
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,910
upload with everything.

404
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,603
Therefore, decrease there.
- Right.

405
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:05,284
Wait a little, that
is Andrea Mead Lawrence.

406
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:07,589
It is decreasing. You're slower, right?

407
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,642
Okay, it was almost perfect,
you saw?

408
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:16,248
She lost some time, but
managed to control himself, understood?

409
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,896
Now go ahead and do
your training, okay?

410
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:24,568
My main opponent
was a girl named...

411
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,786
Andrea Lawrence.

412
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,446
Great skier from the east
who needed to beat the...

413
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:30,871
Race as much as I do.

414
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:34,115
But after seeing her train I
concludes that he could beat her.

415
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,936
She was decreasing a lot
in the corkscrew and it was there...

416
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,579
that I could beat it.

417
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,898
- Jill!
- Buddy!

418
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,495
- I wanted to wish good luck. Also for you.

419
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,131
- Take.
- What is it?

420
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:14,219
- I want you to stay with you.
- What is?

421
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,513
Saint Kitts, for luck.

422
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:20,296
- I have to go.
- Jill.

423
00:34:20,647 --> 00:34:22,811
I want to go to the
olympics married.

424
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,998
With me And with whom would it be?

425
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:28,354
I do not know. I'm a heap of nerves.

426
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,955
Now I have to go.

427
00:34:32,956 --> 00:34:34,919
I love you.

428
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:38,556
I love you, too.

429
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:40,334
We meet there
down, right?

430
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:40,858
Right.

431
00:34:41,237 --> 00:34:42,436
And we talk about
that there too.

432
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:44,729
- Right.
- Good luck.

433
00:34:47,057 --> 00:34:50,895
<i>With the No. 14 by the
male division, Bob Lowner...</i>

434
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,746
<i>in his first race.</i>

435
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,446
- See that. How he fell.

436
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:40,519
<i>Right and left.

two main competitors...</i>

438

<i>Andrea Mead Lawrence and
Jill Kinmont are still going to run.</i>

Go Andy!

442
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,968
Yes, we are ready.

443
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:04,072
Three, two, one, already!

444
00:36:22,276 --> 00:36:24,937
And here she comes - coming down very well.

445
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,600
It will be difficult to beat her. 
Half the race is over.

446
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:49,259
<i>Next competitor, No. 89,
Jill Kinmont.</i>

447
00:36:52,078 --> 00:36:54,014
You can win the race.

448
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,973
You have to win, right?

449
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:59,080
Be sweaty, use your head
and watch the mountain.

450
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,067
Are they all ready?
- Yes.  - Chronometrists too? 
Yes, all set.

451
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:03,380
Everything ready for the
skier No. 89.

452
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:05,267
- Yes, everything is ready.
- It's ok.

453
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:07,246
Ten seconds!

454
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:08,832
Ten seconds.

455
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,317
Five, four, three,
two, one, already!

456
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:19,640
Empty the lane, please.
Empty the lane.

457
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:10,751
It's okay. They're already doing it.

458
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:13,195
Yes, they are.

459
00:38:13,196 --> 00:38:15,175
Empty the track. Want to
Empty the track, please.

460
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:25,425
Do you feel pain in some place, Jill?

461
00:38:58,317 --> 00:39:00,906
I do not feel anything.

462
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:02,434
Can you feel your toes?

463
00:39:04,547 --> 00:39:06,889
No. Jill, it's David.

464
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,621
We will take care of her.

465
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:12,878
Jill, I want you to listen to me.
Try to stay calm.

466
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,766
These people will take care of you, okay?

467
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:17,118
I'm going down to the bottom
and I'll see you from here.

468
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,366
- Are you okay?
- Right.

469
00:39:21,383 --> 00:39:24,556
Don, Jake, take her by the arms.

470
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:25,942
Sam. You take
by the legs.

471
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:27,329
Skeeter, you hold your feet.

472
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,855
Let's straighten it out. Careful and slow.

473
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,915
That's right. It's only gonna take a minute.

474
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,062
Hold on, Jill.

475
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:38,774
Straighten up and her leg
a little longer, Skeeter.

476
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:41,069
It's okay. When I say three, let's get her up.

477
00:39:42,165 --> 00:39:45,744
Slowly. One two Three.

478
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:55,684
Slow down, that.

479
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,943
So. Cover it now.

480
00:40:08,587 --> 00:40:12,673
Ready?
One two Three.

481
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:21,975
Slow down, be careful.
Try to keep it level.

482
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:29,207
So. Caution.

483
00:41:46,596 --> 00:41:49,765
Back, please. Please, back.

484
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,080
Driver. How long will it take?

485
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:25,424
You are very bottled.
It may take hours.

486
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:26,899
She will not succeed.

487
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,404
David, I will not die.

488
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:33,418
I want you to hear me.

489
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:35,754
This is Jill Kinmont.

490
00:42:37,842 --> 00:42:40,693
And she will not die. You understood well?

491
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:14,958
My head. What's in my head?  It is the traction.

492
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:16,012
Jill.

493
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,509
You will be
good Jill.

494
00:44:30,141 --> 00:44:33,020
Are you listening to me?

495
00:44:33,021 --> 00:44:35,567
Do not look at me like that.

496
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:38,790
Sleep, Jill.

497
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,428
Close your eyes and sleep.

498
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,671
If I sleep,
do not agree more.

499
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:48,251
You will heal yourself, Jill.

500
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,816
Yes you will.

501
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:53,852
Help me stay awake, Buddy. 
Help me stay awake.

502
00:44:53,853 --> 00:45:00,014
There was a fracture with
displacement of the spine...

503
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:10,423
at C5 level.

504
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,587
In simple language,
means that...

505
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,998
Her neck broke.

506
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:24,160
And the marrow was
entirely broken.

507
00:45:28,335 --> 00:45:30,109
And is there a cure?

508
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:32,910
It will merge.

509
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:34,989
But that's not the same thing as healing.

510
00:45:38,207 --> 00:45:41,720
- What is the...
- Prognosis?

511
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:43,950
Yes.

512
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:48,184
At this point...

513
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:50,509
It is a matter of speculation.
We will have to wait...

514
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,495
she tells us.

515
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:57,956
In the meantime, all we have to do is wait.

516
00:45:57,957 --> 00:46:00,695
And twist.

517
00:46:00,696 --> 00:46:04,485
Wait for her to walk?

518
00:46:04,486 --> 00:46:06,512
Let her live.

519
00:47:03,673 --> 00:47:06,119
One, two, three.

520
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,397
Who is there?

521
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:53,267
Hi, I'm your doctor,
Dr. Pittman.

522
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:58,099
There is blood in your shoe. Oh, it's life.

523
00:47:58,513 --> 00:47:59,978
I hope it is not mine.

524
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:05,034
Wait outside.

525
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:11,306
- Jill. Mom, come here.

526
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,923
- Oh, Jill.
- I do not see you.

527
00:48:18,924 --> 00:48:21,674
- Can you turn it on? We turn now.

528
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:36,057
Please do not cry, Mom.

529
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:38,434
His eyes are filled with water.

530
00:48:38,435 --> 00:48:40,834
Do not cry too or
will wet my whole face.

531
00:48:45,118 --> 00:48:47,086
No, just with eyes.

532
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,964
It hurts the head.

533
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,074
I'm almost done.

534
00:48:58,075 --> 00:48:59,893
And come back again.

535
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:03,313
Great.

536
00:49:06,116 --> 00:49:07,737
Nurse.

537
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,928
Thank you.

538
00:49:15,448 --> 00:49:19,458
- It's bad, no.
- Why do you say that.

539
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:23,293
I suspect smiling doctors.

540
00:49:26,946 --> 00:49:29,623
Want to hear about it?

541
00:49:29,624 --> 00:49:31,179
Of course.

542
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:36,004
Nothing seems to have been left here below.

543
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,443
No movement, no feelings...

544
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:41,501
of any kind.

545
00:49:43,604 --> 00:49:46,551
If the fracture had been
a fraction below.

546
00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:50,209
You would have lost the
use of your hands.

547
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:53,479
But if it had been
a fraction above...

548
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,586
You would have to live
in a steel lung.

549
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:04,346
- How long?
- How long?

550
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:07,439
For me to get well.

551
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:16,912
- Jill.
- Dr. Pittman.

552
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:21,359
- You do not understand. And not you.

553
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,262
I have a mania, you know.
How much do I want some...

554
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:28,450
thing, I can.

555
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:29,956
I understand this, but...

556
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:32,106
No, you do not understand.

557
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:35,121
I'm going to walk out of here.

558
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:39,185
And if you tell someone who will 
be the opposite...

559
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:42,081
I'll leave you
with your face to the ground.

560
00:50:50,845 --> 00:50:52,449
Hi.

561
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:58,728
How are you feeling?
- Very well.

562
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:01,726
I'm coming home.

563
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,276
So I decided to go
here and tell you that...

564
00:51:06,277 --> 00:51:09,334
if you need anything, anything...

565
00:51:09,617 --> 00:51:12,054
same, just ask me
for them to call me...

566
00:51:12,055 --> 00:51:14,341
Then I'll see what I can do.

567
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:17,848
I think they
are very competent.

568
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:20,026
They are doing a good job.

569
00:51:20,027 --> 00:51:22,407
Yes. Look at this mess.

570
00:51:22,408 --> 00:51:26,006
Yes, I saw this.

571
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:28,592
How is Anie getting successful?

572
00:51:28,977 --> 00:51:31,229
He was already successful before.

573
00:51:32,346 --> 00:51:34,589
She won
many races.

574
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,290
She is a good skier.

575
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:39,094
Great skier,
great skier.

576
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:56,990
You have practically everything here, no.

577
00:51:57,057 --> 00:52:01,714
David, David.

578
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,744
David.

579
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:17,267
Everything is fine.

580
00:52:18,922 --> 00:52:20,945
It's... alright.

581
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:28,210
I see you soon.

582
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:33,436
= Bye.

583
00:52:39,178 --> 00:52:41,323
I felt very much to be
_ obliged to leave...

584
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,358
Before you woke up.

585
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:47,204
But I intend to compensate
this by spending the rest of my life...

586
00:52:47,227 --> 00:52:52,603
Seeing you wake up and go to 
sleep in our own bed.

587
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:56,677
Can not imagine how
I was excited...

588
00:52:56,787 --> 00:52:58,965
When I read
that you will...

589
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:02,146
When I read that you are going 
to go back to skiing.

590
00:53:02,147 --> 00:53:05,954
But I knew you would not settle for less.

591
00:53:05,955 --> 00:53:08,804
When I can
join enough money...

592
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:13,486
to visit you. You will walk to me...

593
00:53:13,487 --> 00:53:19,034
And to my arms. And we'll go walking together.

594
00:53:19,498 --> 00:53:22,058
With love, Buddy.

595
00:53:22,462 --> 00:53:24,462
He is wonderful.

596
00:53:24,524 --> 00:53:25,775
Yes it is.

597
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:29,191
And you are a
lucky girl.

598
00:53:31,299 --> 00:53:33,506
Is here the crippled sector?

599
00:53:33,507 --> 00:53:35,930
A.J? Mom, it's A.J.!

600
00:53:36,702 --> 00:53:39,111
Audra Jo!

601
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:41,024
In the flesh.

602
00:53:41,025 --> 00:53:43,789
Look at you,
on crutches.

603
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,163
Queer, right?

604
00:53:45,477 --> 00:53:49,441
No, fantastic.
Unbelievable.

605
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:51,959
Come here, Josie.
Come here.

606
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:54,793
- How did you get here? I got a ride.

607
00:53:54,794 --> 00:53:56,212
How crazy.
- Oh really.

608
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:59,577
I took a ride with my
therapist, his family lives here.

609
00:53:59,578 --> 00:54:01,801
And he is handsome. What do you think?

610
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:03,777
I think it's sensational.

611
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:15,159
- Open your mouth.
- No.

612
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,552
Good...

613
00:54:30,553 --> 00:54:33,090
I have to go.

614
00:54:34,928 --> 00:54:37,907
Do you want to see me again?

615
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:45,803
Jill. Good friends are the ones 
who tell the truth.

616
00:54:46,113 --> 00:54:48,169
What do you want me to do?

617
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,222
Stop trying?
Who gives up?

618
00:54:51,223 --> 00:54:53,654
What do you want? The Academy Award?

619
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,184
I want to walk.

620
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,141
What is so important about walking?

621
00:54:57,142 --> 00:54:59,431
For God's sake. A three-year-old 
child can walk.

622
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:00,908
Because I can not walk.

623
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:02,625
I can not even move.

624
00:55:02,627 --> 00:55:06,384
So take it, Jill. Admit it.
Stop playing heroin.

625
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:09,829
I remember very well that you 
wanted to be a hero.

626
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,109
At that time many people laughed at you.

627
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:15,826
Yes. But I did not tell anyone 
who was going to climb Everest.

628
00:55:15,827 --> 00:55:17,678
Advice from a
veteran cripple.

629
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,659
You have to know what you are. 
And say what you are.

630
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,254
Before you set out to
work with little...

631
00:55:22,255 --> 00:55:24,711
That remains of you.

632
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:31,456
Audra Jo. What if there was nothing 
left of me in the end?

633
00:55:31,457 --> 00:55:34,080
So you'll have to learn
to paint with your teeth.

634
00:55:34,145 --> 00:55:36,250
What happened to you?

635
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:38,032
The same thing that will happen
with you.

636
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:40,138
There's only one thing that kills 
the cripples.

637
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:43,354
It is not to value
to themselves.

638
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:45,948
You still have
your arms, Audra Jo.

639
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:48,528
Great, we go to the center
of rehabilitation and I show...

640
00:55:48,529 --> 00:55:50,447
someone who has no face
or a child in...

641
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,361
a steel lung.

642
00:55:51,669 --> 00:55:52,432
Enough.

643
00:55:52,513 --> 00:55:54,620
So stop moaning
the loss of your medals...

644
00:55:54,621 --> 00:55:57,406
Olympic and thank God for still 
having your head.

645
00:55:57,407 --> 00:55:59,970
Anything else
is superfluous.

646
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:14,196
- Audra Jo.
- What?

647
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:16,877
I could have won.

648
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,106
Did you know that?

649
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:21,577
Beaten or what?

650
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:24,305
The Snow Bowl.

651
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:30,059
The Cup of the Snow...

652
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,986
Was not this tournament that 
ended your career?

653
00:56:42,783 --> 00:56:46,017
An iron disposition, to
declare from the bed of a...

654
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:49,829
hospital she
will go back to skiing.

655
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,935
They say that you will
go back to ski.

656
00:56:52,936 --> 00:56:54,979
And you will.

657
00:56:55,257 --> 00:56:56,608
You will come back
to ski.

658
00:57:03,331 --> 00:57:07,021
In the spring I was transferred 
to a hospital in Los Angeles.

659
00:57:07,022 --> 00:57:09,828
And that began work
to find out what I had...

660
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:12,830
and what I did not have. Now, deeper.

661
00:57:12,831 --> 00:57:16,929
Likewise, Jill.
Now continue.

662
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:19,297
Continue pulling
safely.

663
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:20,862
Keep your head to the front and 
keep pulling.

664
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:24,141
I started getting familiar
with words like extenders,

665
00:57:24,142 --> 00:57:27,258
Flexors, deltoids, trapezoids.

666
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:30,822
And I exercised more than I have 
exercised in my entire life.

667
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:34,281
Continue, that's right. So, Jill. Is very good.

668
00:57:35,048 --> 00:57:37,542
Very good indeed.

669
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:45,052
Now, stretch very slowly. Slowly. Like this.

670
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:53,190
- Hi, I'm Dr. Enders. Hi, Doctor.

671
00:57:53,191 --> 00:57:55,218
- I can save your time.
- Ah yes.

672
00:57:55,295 --> 00:57:57,298
I have biceps, but I do not have triceps.

673
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:59,363
Deltoids, but not pectorals.

674
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,957
Just a little bit of
pectoral on the left side...

675
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,279
but not much.

676
00:58:03,285 --> 00:58:05,729
I believe it's a bit unusual
, but it was a fracture...

677
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,978
cross, so the left
side is a bit stronger.

678
00:58:08,979 --> 00:58:10,998
Oh, yes. And how do you feel?

679
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:13,837
I'm fine, and you?

680
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:15,868
I want you to squeeze your fingers now.

681
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,612
Very well. I want to feel pressure on my finger.

682
00:58:18,613 --> 00:58:19,388
It's okay.

683
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:22,077
Push.

684
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:24,732
Push. Not the arm, Jill. He's moving his arm.

685
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:27,447
Great, try again.
Push.

686
00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:29,351
- It's still your arm.
- Right.

687
00:58:30,479 --> 00:58:32,506
Let's try more
once.

688
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:34,116
Ok.

689
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:44,112
Now try not to look at your arm.

690
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:48,175
Just look at the board
and let's see what happens.

691
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:01,179
Now, just worry
with your shoulder.

692
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,800
Let your shoulders do
the move up and...

693
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:05,408
and gravity will do the rest.

694
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:12,614
Come on. That.

695
00:59:12,836 --> 00:59:15,362
More with the shoulder.

696
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,764
We are going well.

697
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:23,976
More strength with
the shoulder, more.

698
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:28,209
So.

699
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:30,554
You can.

700
00:59:30,555 --> 00:59:32,525
- Come on, come on.
- That.

701
00:59:33,894 --> 00:59:35,775
- Come on!
- Continues!

702
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,141
- Come on!
- Let's go!

703
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:44,866
- Come on!
- Push!

704
00:59:45,076 --> 00:59:47,724
- Come on!
- Do it!

705
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:59,972
- How am I?
- You look beautiful.

706
01:00:00,052 --> 01:00:01,505
Go there and see how
I get the distance.

707
01:00:02,445 --> 01:00:04,169
Oh, it's wonderful.

708
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:05,473
Where are the fried potatoes?

709
01:00:05,474 --> 01:00:06,752
- They are on your lap.
- Can go.

710
01:00:25,338 --> 01:00:27,890
Hi.

711
01:00:29,612 --> 01:00:32,001
Enter.

712
01:00:41,814 --> 01:00:43,060
You look beautiful.

713
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,209
- Do you think? Yes.

714
01:00:58,561 --> 01:01:01,055
Oh, Buddy, I miss you.

715
01:01:01,056 --> 01:01:03,944
I was homesick too.

716
01:01:04,614 --> 01:01:05,794
Can you kiss me?

717
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:21,935
Are you okay?

718
01:01:22,031 --> 01:01:23,831
I am wonderful.

719
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:27,888
I tried to write
every week.

720
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:30,478
Did you try?

721
01:01:31,323 --> 01:01:33,684
Well, I just tried.

722
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,823
Want to see something exciting?

723
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,445
If you want to show me.

724
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,693
If you want to see it.

725
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:50,659
That's what I came for, was not it?

726
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,727
Go there and
look here.

727
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,151
Will not you need help?

728
01:01:55,928 --> 01:01:57,922
Are you sure?

729
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,723
Go there and look.

730
01:01:59,794 --> 01:02:02,095
It's okay.

731
01:02:06,746 --> 01:02:09,318
Now feel.

732
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:18,667
Come on, I'm waiting.

733
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:21,714
Hold your breath and
do not say anything.

734
01:02:21,715 --> 01:02:25,820
This requires a tremendous concentration.

735
01:02:25,821 --> 01:02:29,760
Come on, Jill. 
I've been waiting for it for a long time.

736
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,499
It's okay. Watch with
attention because the hand...

737
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:38,269
is faster than
the eye.

738
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:51,494
And neither broke.

739
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,525
Did not you see what I did?

740
01:04:02,473 --> 01:04:05,496
It was the hardest
so far.

741
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:10,605
Jill.

742
01:04:12,593 --> 01:04:14,749
Are not you going to walk?

743
01:04:16,808 --> 01:04:19,349
Walk?
- It's...

744
01:04:19,914 --> 01:04:22,712
I thought you were...

745
01:04:26,578 --> 01:04:28,659
No.  I will never walk again.

746
01:05:08,192 --> 01:05:10,980
Buddy phoned a week later.

747
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:12,295
I never heard from him again.

748
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:00,438
How about taking her home for a while?

749
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:03,068
Physically she is more
capable than ever.

750
01:06:03,069 --> 01:06:04,852
It would be a good rest
before it was transferred...

751
01:06:05,115 --> 01:06:07,899
to the California Rehabilitation Center.

752
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:10,505
That's another problem, Dr. Enders.

753
01:06:10,507 --> 01:06:13,738
She does not want to go to the
Rehabilitation Center.

754
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:17,384
Every time I mention
the Rehabilitation Center...

755
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:19,397
She says she does not need
nobody to teach...

756
01:06:19,398 --> 01:06:20,934
How to sell pencils.

757
01:06:42,135 --> 01:06:44,438
What do you want?

758
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:46,892
It's time for the injection.

759
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:49,394
Injection of what?

760
01:06:49,395 --> 01:06:52,873
Of what you most need, my dear.

761
01:06:54,961 --> 01:06:57,490
Oh, my God. I do not believe it.

762
01:06:57,491 --> 01:07:00,813
Well, you'd better believe girl. 
And get your ass off that bed.

763
01:07:00,814 --> 01:07:03,125
- What are you doing here? You have a coat?

764
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:05,316
- What are you doing here? Taking you.

765
01:07:08,913 --> 01:07:10,317
Where is this bottle connected?

766
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,932
She is permanent.

767
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:14,735
Then she goes along.

768
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:17,039
- Who is this? My only friend.

769
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:23,337
Dick. I can not be removed in this way.

770
01:07:23,486 --> 01:07:25,187
Who said that?
- The doctors.

771
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:26,474
Well, doctors do not know anything.

772
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:27,161
Dick!

773
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,280
Listen, one more word of yours and
I pat your ass.

774
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:34,489
And I would not feel anything. 
You'll be glad you do not feel it.

775
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:35,822
Jesus, you are heavy.

776
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:39,427
- You're totally crazy. 
And you were not the first to notice.

777
01:07:48,813 --> 01:07:50,854
- Good morning.
- Good Morning.

778
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:59,196
Dick, please,
watch out for the ladder!

779
01:07:59,947 --> 01:08:03,150
Dick, stop, please. Dick, this is crazy!

780
01:08:03,151 --> 01:08:06,016
Open up wings, it will pass
a paraplegic.

781
01:08:14,903 --> 01:08:16,404
Buek, the signal will open.

782
01:08:16,405 --> 01:08:18,431
No one runs over a
wheelchair.

783
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:20,043
Will open!

784
01:08:20,044 --> 01:08:22,351
Open it, what will you do?

785
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,019
What are you doing?

786
01:08:29,216 --> 01:08:31,120
It's okay. I have a few things to say to you.

787
01:08:31,121 --> 01:08:32,492
But she needed a little privacy.

788
01:08:32,493 --> 01:08:34,688
Why do not you say
to your bride?

789
01:08:35,281 --> 01:08:37,293
Because I do not have
bride, she did not want me.

790
01:08:37,294 --> 01:08:39,370
I do not blame her, because
I would not either.

791
01:08:39,371 --> 01:08:41,115
Oh is it? For it is better to think twice...

792
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:43,503
about this because you
will get a damn job...

793
01:08:43,955 --> 01:08:45,523
To attract lovers
lying in the drug of that...

794
01:08:45,524 --> 01:08:47,497
hospital bed, made
a lot of clay.

795
01:08:48,058 --> 01:08:49,853
Ah, poor thing. And mourn
rather than maybe...

796
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,338
get some idiot
like Buddy Weber...

797
01:08:52,489 --> 01:08:54,057
Feel sorry for you.

798
01:08:54,058 --> 01:08:55,887
Oh, you've talked too much.
I've heard.

799
01:08:55,888 --> 01:08:58,067
No, you did not hear everything.
Because I'm going to stay here...

800
01:08:58,068 --> 01:09:00,243
Until you get the hang of it. 
You understood.

801
01:09:00,321 --> 01:09:02,111
I do not care about you
not being able to ski.

802
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,620
And it matters little to me - you can not walk.

803
01:09:04,814 --> 01:09:06,248
I do not care if you
creeps around...

804
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:07,158
made a gecko.

805
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:08,878
This will not make me feel pity for you.

806
01:09:08,879 --> 01:09:11,743
You are too presumptuous,
to think that I need you.

807
01:09:11,744 --> 01:09:13,002
I do not care if
you need it or not.

808
01:09:13,003 --> 01:09:15,942
I have nothing better
to do with you.

809
01:09:17,986 --> 01:09:20,313
This is a public road, come on!

810
01:09:20,874 --> 01:09:22,836
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not
understand what you're saying.

811
01:09:22,837 --> 01:09:24,234
Do you want me to check the oil?

812
01:09:24,648 --> 01:09:26,251
Are you going crazy, boy?

813
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:27,911
What the hell did you decide to 
do with my car?

814
01:09:27,912 --> 01:09:30,303
Move away from there.

815
01:09:30,493 --> 01:09:32,226
This is a particular
property.

816
01:09:32,405 --> 01:09:33,765
You can not do this.

817
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:36,870
Get away from that car, boy.

818
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:38,449
Wait a little.

819
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,494
The oil is low.

820
01:09:39,894 --> 01:09:41,990
What? I changed the oil last week.

821
01:09:42,592 --> 01:09:43,650
You are crazy, are you?

822
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:45,488
Look here, boy.
Put that in place.

823
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:47,559
Or I'm going to get out of here.
I will inform the authorities.

824
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,071
I will sue you.

825
01:09:49,914 --> 01:09:52,701
This will not be
_ like that, boy.

826
01:09:52,702 --> 01:09:54,729
Ready. Are not you going to pay me now?

827
01:09:54,956 --> 01:09:57,064
I want my money
.

828
01:10:04,812 --> 01:10:07,774
WELCOME JILL.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

829
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:57,996
I get off the plane and suddenly
we were surrounded by...

830
01:10:57,998 --> 01:10:59,600
a lot of men
with machine guns.

831
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:00,656
They thought we were spies.

832
01:11:01,045 --> 01:11:03,315
Wow, machine guns. Did you hear that, Father?

833
01:11:03,316 --> 01:11:06,412
What are your plans, Dick.
I say about the future.

834
01:11:06,413 --> 01:11:09,157
Well, I do not have any.

835
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:12,312
I live one day
at a time.

836
01:11:17,009 --> 01:11:20,637
Jake, cut the meat for me?

837
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,078
Cut yourself.

838
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:26,769
We can not spoil it.

839
01:11:27,813 --> 01:11:30,935
That is her problem.

840
01:11:31,111 --> 01:11:33,833
As I said. I was sitting there in the woods.

841
01:11:33,834 --> 01:11:35,769
I did not know any of those people.

842
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:37,753
They did not know what government I was.

843
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:41,839
They arrested me for... - 
I think I stayed there for a couple of days.

844
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,714
Finally I got to go from Ã” hitchhiking to Acapulco.

845
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:48,018
- Take it easy, let's take it easy.
- I'm afraid.

846
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:52,435
I am holding you.
There is no danger.

847
01:11:54,089 --> 01:11:56,017
Dick. Ah yes, look there.

848
01:11:56,018 --> 01:11:57,385
See? There is no danger.

849
01:11:57,386 --> 01:11:58,801
I think that's enough. Wait, Bill.

850
01:11:58,802 --> 01:12:02,649
Father, leave him alone. 
He knows what he's doing.

851
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,518
You have no way.

852
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:05,562
You.

853
01:12:09,228 --> 01:12:14,503
You do not want to wet your hair, do you?

854
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:19,135
They're already wet, Dick.
They are already wet.

855
01:12:19,162 --> 01:12:20,871
Come on, extend your arms.
Put your arms here.

856
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:24,333
Like a boat. I'm scared, Dick.

857
01:12:24,531 --> 01:12:26,275
Dick.

858
01:12:26,276 --> 01:12:28,522
Dick, come here. 
Do not leave me here alone.

859
01:12:28,523 --> 01:12:30,568
Please,
I'm scared.

860
01:12:31,579 --> 01:12:32,554
Dick, please.

861
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:34,733
Dick, I'm slipping. Dick, Dick!

862
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:38,419
Dick, I'm slipping, Dick.

863
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:52,369
Jill!

864
01:12:57,709 --> 01:13:01,112
Calm down, I got you.

865
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:06,920
Is everything okay?

866
01:13:09,315 --> 01:13:10,359
Calm down.

867
01:13:13,183 --> 01:13:16,585
Are you okay? Ok.

868
01:13:16,586 --> 01:13:20,856
I'm sorry.
Was inadvertently.

869
01:13:20,857 --> 01:13:23,263
It was not meant to be.

870
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:26,876
I just wanted to see how you did it, that's all.

871
01:13:26,877 --> 01:13:30,233
Are you okay?
Excuse me.

872
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:39,167
- Because, Dick. I did not mean it.

873
01:13:39,518 --> 01:13:41,571
What do you think?

874
01:13:41,572 --> 01:13:42,999
I do not know.

875
01:13:43,158 --> 01:13:46,129
I already have the house
all in the head.

876
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,735
No stairs, only ramps.

877
01:13:48,736 --> 01:13:50,965
All things in the kitchen
in low places.

878
01:13:50,966 --> 01:13:54,371
Up to the sink, 60 cm high.

879
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:59,071
Yes. I can not have children, Dick.

880
01:13:59,072 --> 01:14:01,209
I already thought of that.

881
01:14:05,385 --> 01:14:06,912
I...

882
01:14:06,913 --> 01:14:09,943
I do not feel anything.

883
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,347
From the neck down.

884
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:20,932
So I do not know how we'll make love.

885
01:14:23,177 --> 01:14:24,938
Not only that we will do.

886
01:14:27,027 --> 01:14:28,637
You'll want more than me.

887
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,616
The people of arranja.

888
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:34,710
No, you were going to get tired.

889
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:36,669
It would come out to give its
turns with...

890
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:40,702
No, never again. I'm going to get a job.

891
01:14:40,703 --> 01:14:42,078
I will not do that.

892
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:45,996
For God's sake. Someone has to do this to me.

893
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:48,316
What is it?

894
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,763
You will tell me.

895
01:14:50,839 --> 01:14:54,199
Why are you so reluctant?
- I know.

896
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:03,214
There must be something...

897
01:15:03,294 --> 01:15:06,816
something that avoids...

898
01:15:06,817 --> 01:15:09,723
that I am so...

899
01:15:09,724 --> 01:15:12,619
= = Useless.

900
01:15:13,664 --> 01:15:15,462
It seems we have
the same problem.

901
01:15:19,433 --> 01:15:21,471
Clear my nose.

902
01:15:21,616 --> 01:15:23,373
Okay?

903
01:15:24,418 --> 01:15:27,024
Only if you say you love me.

904
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:31,514
I love it.
I Love.

905
01:15:50,135 --> 01:15:51,665
I'm going to build that house.

906
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:54,805
Okay?

907
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,208
What if you do not want it...

908
01:15:57,562 --> 01:16:00,466
I can find another
crippled to live there.

909
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:02,672
It's okay.

910
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,929
Are you listening?

911
01:16:10,061 --> 01:16:12,332
It is the bell of the Indian reservation school.

912
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:18,430
- Which tribe?
- Paiute.

913
01:16:18,431 --> 01:16:20,740
Do you know anyone there?

914
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:23,470
No.  We had two in
grammar classes, but...

915
01:16:23,603 --> 01:16:26,791
They were very quiet boys.

916
01:16:27,144 --> 01:16:29,203
Yeah, usually they are.

917
01:16:29,204 --> 01:16:31,392
Why did you ask?

918
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:37,403
Have you ever been there?

919
01:16:37,404 --> 01:16:38,031
No.  You mean you lived in this city all your life...

920
01:16:38,415 --> 01:16:40,559
- and did not go there even once?
- Never.

921
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,614
Good, so I guess
it's time for you to go.

922
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:46,519
I do not understand.

923
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:58,677
Why does no one help them?

924
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:01,499
Because they are busy
trying to organize...

925
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,207
their own lives.

926
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:05,462
Why do they stay in this place?

927
01:17:05,463 --> 01:17:07,666
Why do not they leave?

928
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:09,669
They have no other place to go.

929
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,320
The problem is the teachers, Jill.

930
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:21,666
They pay almost nothing
to those who teach...

931
01:17:24,472 --> 01:17:25,774
in indigenous reservations.

932
01:17:25,775 --> 01:17:30,433
So good teachers go to places like Los Angeles.

933
01:17:30,434 --> 01:17:33,112
But that is not fair.

934
01:17:33,113 --> 01:17:36,293
Many things are not fair, my dear.

935
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:38,370
I at least had a chance.
But those people do not have...

936
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,235
the least chance.

937
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:43,124
Mother, father. Dick let me fly the plane.

938
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,535
- What? I left nothing.

939
01:17:44,536 --> 01:17:45,954
See if you do not get me in trouble.

940
01:17:45,955 --> 01:17:47,334
I did not,
I swear.

941
01:17:47,491 --> 01:17:50,879
- Did you revise it?
- To go away.

942
01:17:51,924 --> 01:17:54,613
Where?
- Home.

943
01:17:56,701 --> 01:17:58,486
Are you leaving?

944
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:03,210
You did not expect me to stay forever, did you?

945
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:13,504
It will only be,
for a while. Jill.

946
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:17,886
Why did not you tell me?
It was so fast.

947
01:18:17,887 --> 01:18:19,208
You will have to
do the rehabilitation.

948
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:20,786
I'm going to build the house.

949
01:18:20,914 --> 01:18:22,959
And in the spring...

950
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,394
Spring is far away.

951
01:18:29,155 --> 01:18:31,513
Time passes so quickly.

952
01:18:31,594 --> 01:18:36,061
Dick.

953
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,150
Do you want to stop? So you're going to
make me cry too.

954
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:47,828
It's good to have friends who 
can make us cry.

955
01:18:47,829 --> 01:18:53,232
Not everyone has
friends who do this.

956
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:55,395
Okay, you'll be fine.

957
01:18:56,986 --> 01:18:59,269
You will be fine.

958
01:19:02,401 --> 01:19:04,577
Take it easy, take it easy.

959
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,685
Calm down, that.

960
01:19:07,686 --> 01:19:10,671
Calm down.

961
01:19:11,977 --> 01:19:15,316
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

962
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:16,978
I'll be right back.

963
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:19,220
Okay? You are OK?

964
01:19:19,251 --> 01:19:21,454
Okay?

965
01:19:21,564 --> 01:19:23,509
Okay!

966
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:08,470
Jill, you will love
this place.

967
01:21:08,644 --> 01:21:10,555
It does not look like much
with a Rehabilitation Center.

968
01:21:10,606 --> 01:21:12,560
If it looks like one more
great party.

969
01:21:12,561 --> 01:21:13,879
It is one of the most participating.

970
01:21:13,929 --> 01:21:16,576
You will meet the other
inmates, they are great.

971
01:21:16,577 --> 01:21:17,436
Fantastic.

972
01:21:18,112 --> 01:21:19,706
Well, they are strangers,
at first.

973
01:21:20,183 --> 01:21:21,476
But as soon as you
know better,

974
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:23,409
will like them.

975
01:21:27,814 --> 01:21:33,207
Personally, this is Jill.
Jill, these are Keny, Cookie,

976
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:35,277
- Neil. Welcome to the circus.

977
01:21:35,278 --> 01:21:38,374
Bill, George...

978
01:21:39,593 --> 01:21:40,711
Pat!

979
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:42,255
And there are Willis and Lee.  Lee Zadroga.

980
01:21:42,492 --> 01:21:44,603
Bill? Did you see the play he did?

981
01:21:46,692 --> 01:21:48,643
- It was Willie Mays!
- Duke Snider!

982
01:21:49,164 --> 01:21:50,607
It was who?
- Duck Snider!

983
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:53,116
- Willie Mays! Duke Snider, right?

984
01:21:53,124 --> 01:21:54,734
Over the shoulder,
over the shoulder.

985
01:21:54,738 --> 01:21:56,842
I think it was the
Duke Snider!

986
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:58,414
Charlie how can you compare a 
white with a black?

987
01:22:01,567 --> 01:22:03,654
I can, that's why I say it was Willie Mays.

988
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,250
Jill was a famous person. Someone here knew that?

989
01:22:19,253 --> 01:22:21,097
What did you do, Jill?

990
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,143
He did nothing.

991
01:22:22,427 --> 01:22:23,769
Her photograph left
on the cover...

992
01:22:23,771 --> 01:22:25,840
From the magazine of popular mechanics.

993
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:29,115
Yes. She was the cripple of the month.

994
01:22:30,517 --> 01:22:34,843
- Will do what, now?
- I do not know.

995
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:37,444
Try to be useful.

996
01:22:38,099 --> 01:22:40,449
Useful how?

997
01:22:40,627 --> 01:22:42,931
Try to teach.

998
01:22:42,932 --> 01:22:45,102
For example.

999
01:22:45,112 --> 01:22:47,936
And after that she will try to 
be a neurosurgeon.

1000
01:22:49,496 --> 01:22:52,842
She was skiing. 
It was America's hope in the Olympics.

1001
01:22:52,961 --> 01:22:56,844
Well, she can hold the skis
in the chair and go back to ski.

1002
01:22:57,761 --> 01:23:00,231
And then, Jill. 
Are not you going to say anything?

1003
01:23:00,232 --> 01:23:02,584
Maybe she can not say anything 
without the press nearby.

1004
01:23:02,587 --> 01:23:04,532
You know, it's a
famous girl.

1005
01:23:04,717 --> 01:23:07,061
Jill. On basketball court
we thought of...

1006
01:23:07,062 --> 01:23:09,491
fact that we were
something.

1007
01:23:09,492 --> 01:23:11,764
We always left the court
very happy.

1008
01:23:12,073 --> 01:23:14,951
And one of the guys from the team
made a joke saying:

1009
01:23:14,961 --> 01:23:19,258
Why are we happy? We beat a bunch of cripples.

1010
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:22,195
It's beautiful in this chair.

1011
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:25,078
I love this chair. It's a wonderful world!

1012
01:23:25,327 --> 01:23:26,937
Hey, wait there guys.
She's only been here for...

1013
01:23:26,942 --> 01:23:29,196
a few hours, and therefore,
we will handle, right?

1014
01:23:29,702 --> 01:23:31,343
She's still wanting
sympathy, Ken.

1015
01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:33,272
You know
sympathy in the dictionary...

1016
01:23:33,273 --> 01:23:35,481
is not it? Between
_ grave and suicide.

1017
01:23:39,134 --> 01:23:42,191
They live in a very isolated
world here.

1018
01:23:42,198 --> 01:23:44,634
Newcomers
are a threat.

1019
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:48,279
Especially those who come with great ideas.

1020
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:50,320
What is so great about wanting to teach?

1021
01:23:50,615 --> 01:23:52,172
This has already been attempted.

1022
01:23:52,201 --> 01:23:54,321
There is not a single school
in the country that accepts a...

1023
01:23:54,415 --> 01:23:55,874
teacher in chair
of wheels.

1024
01:23:55,884 --> 01:23:58,149
Why the paraplegics and the quadriplegics can not...

1025
01:23:58,512 --> 01:24:02,501
nor sign up to
get the certificate.

1026
01:24:02,505 --> 01:24:04,984
- It's not fair. Of course it's not fair.

1027
01:24:05,168 --> 01:24:07,016
But the world out there - 
imagine that if the feet...

1028
01:24:07,507 --> 01:24:10,517
They become paralyzed,
the brain also remains.

1029
01:24:10,521 --> 01:24:13,015
So there is a lot of lost potential.

1030
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,898
People who swallow
defeat because it is...

1031
01:24:15,255 --> 01:24:17,061
tucked in so hard
throat down...

1032
01:24:17,069 --> 01:24:20,307
that do not swallow,
are choked.

1033
01:24:20,315 --> 01:24:23,177
With you not happened?

1034
01:24:23,186 --> 01:24:28,280
Well, in a way it's much easier 
for me than for them.

1035
01:24:28,289 --> 01:24:30,942
They will be paralyzed
forever.

1036
01:24:30,952 --> 01:24:34,642
- And you walk again? No, I'm going to die.

1037
01:24:35,269 --> 01:24:36,417
They gave me a
year of life.

1038
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:40,377
So time is so precious to me.

1039
01:24:40,378 --> 01:24:43,048
I can not allow myself to lose it.

1040
01:24:43,059 --> 01:24:47,954
And what do you do with your time?

1041
01:24:48,544 --> 01:24:50,294
I am studying.

1042
01:24:50,473 --> 01:24:52,337
University.

1043
01:24:52,343 --> 01:24:54,217
I'm doing masters.

1044
01:24:57,011 --> 01:24:59,339
And will it end?

1045
01:24:59,398 --> 01:25:01,564
I will get very close.

1046
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,713
What are you going to do?

1047
01:25:03,715 --> 01:25:04,778
With?

1048
01:25:04,783 --> 01:25:08,695
Now, when are you going to start studying?

1049
01:25:08,807 --> 01:25:11,041
They would not accept me.

1050
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:13,315
My gym notes
were bad.

1051
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:17,119
Look, listen to something.

1052
01:25:17,133 --> 01:25:20,882
When the body goes away, the mind can compensate.

1053
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:23,877
Do you understand this?

1054
01:25:23,879 --> 01:25:26,716
It's like a blind man who suddenly
the hearing gets sharper.

1055
01:25:26,725 --> 01:25:28,803
I already understood.

1056
01:25:28,821 --> 01:25:30,322
But how will they know?

1057
01:25:30,324 --> 01:25:31,449
I'll tell them.

1058
01:25:31,561 --> 01:25:34,585
I recommended Audra Jo and Cookie. 
I can do the same for you.

1059
01:25:34,591 --> 01:25:36,165
I can hurt you.

1060
01:25:36,325 --> 01:25:39,271
My brain has always been the weakest 
muscle in my body.

1061
01:25:39,274 --> 01:25:43,224
Then, force, exercise,
place under training.

1062
01:25:45,043 --> 01:25:46,997
Are you okay?

1063
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:49,181
Say you're fine.

1064
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,690
Ok.

1065
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:12,774
Uh, what a day.

1066
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:14,701
- Now it's my turn.
- Oh yes.

1067
01:26:14,965 --> 01:26:16,878
- Are they ready?
- You are ready?

1068
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:24,129
Do you think I'm what, Tarzan?

1069
01:26:25,175 --> 01:26:27,586
Look, the secretariat is there,
just ahead turning right.

1070
01:26:28,152 --> 01:26:30,205
Are you seeing those columns?

1071
01:26:30,765 --> 01:26:32,101
It will be all right.
You will see.

1072
01:26:32,878 --> 01:26:34,636
- Will it? Of course.

1073
01:26:35,172 --> 01:26:38,015
You have to stay calm. It's ok?

1074
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:42,918
- I'll carry the bags.
- Right.

1075
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:49,350
- You can go.
- It's ok.

1076
01:26:52,576 --> 01:26:54,872
- What class.
- Of course.

1077
01:26:54,874 --> 01:26:56,609
You are next.

1078
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,572
Thanks.

1079
01:27:11,739 --> 01:27:13,527
Ready. Come on, skinny.

1080
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:19,246
Let's see how much
you weigh.

1081
01:27:19,773 --> 01:27:21,531
Beware, huh.

1082
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:23,884
Come on, come on.

1083
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:36,247
Calm down, girls. 
There's a way we can get out of this.

1084
01:27:36,253 --> 01:27:38,898
Tell me which one?

1085
01:27:43,075 --> 01:27:46,799
But what is it? A show of freaks?

1086
01:27:46,865 --> 01:27:49,137
We should charge
tickets.

1087
01:27:49,145 --> 01:27:52,609
And that has an idea much more popular
than in taught...

1088
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:54,963
When I was learning about this subject.

1089
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,354
Do not try to write down what he says, 
just the important points.

1090
01:27:59,365 --> 01:28:02,986
Summarize or use
single words if necessary.

1091
01:28:02,987 --> 01:28:05,396
And the way we knew it was because a man...

1092
01:28:07,422 --> 01:28:10,583
Called Goldsteen took a
pipe and on the sides the paste...

1093
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:20,818
The most important thing
started to happen...

1094
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,521
were the children.

1095
01:28:22,705 --> 01:28:24,830
There were dozens of them in the 
Rehabilitation Center.

1096
01:28:24,836 --> 01:28:29,005
And I began to cling to them,
and them, to me.

1097
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:34,516
Then, Timothy Tom was very skinny.

1098
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,908
But in the Christmas season.
When everyone leaves...

1099
01:28:38,019 --> 01:28:42,081
in search of a turkey,
No one wanted Timothy Ton.

1100
01:28:42,328 --> 01:28:44,390
And he was free.

1101
01:28:46,805 --> 01:28:49,255
When you do a
writing test, you have to...

1102
01:28:49,844 --> 01:28:51,496
Write as a writer.

1103
01:28:51,506 --> 01:28:54,826
Make each sentence say exactly
what you intend.

1104
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,011
If you have a great idea,
make a great sentence.

1105
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:59,759
If you have not, do not.
Simple.

1106
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:11,012
You're right, John. 
It really does look like a bouquet.

1107
01:29:11,461 --> 01:29:14,332
But it is pronounced Bouquet.

1108
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:16,993
I like more
of bouquet.

1109
01:29:17,105 --> 01:29:19,759
Me too. But if you say so...

1110
01:29:19,769 --> 01:29:22,036
Nobody will know what you're talking about.

1111
01:29:22,307 --> 01:29:25,578
Because they do not write right.
- This is complicated.

1112
01:29:26,164 --> 01:29:27,768
Do you understand what I say?

1113
01:29:28,038 --> 01:29:32,263
Jill, I wanted you to be my teacher.

1114
01:29:32,271 --> 01:29:36,145
You know what. I really wanted to be.

1115
01:29:37,095 --> 01:29:40,175
- Do not do this, Jill. 
I have nothing else to lose.

1116
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:41,844
Yes. Faith in humanity.

1117
01:29:41,846 --> 01:29:43,274
Are you wanting to lose your teeth?

1118
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:45,183
I put the denture.

1119
01:29:45,185 --> 01:29:47,521
I can tell you what he's going to tell you now.

1120
01:29:47,532 --> 01:29:49,348
He tells me in
first hand.

1121
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:52,301
You all have been an inspiration to me.

1122
01:29:52,307 --> 01:29:56,022
Absolute inspiration.

1123
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,788
You have been an inspiration to me.

1124
01:29:58,845 --> 01:30:02,383
Absolute inspiration.

1125
01:30:02,385 --> 01:30:05,859
The way you persist
despite the shortcomings...

1126
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:10,075
It makes me feel good
small, actually.

1127
01:30:10,602 --> 01:30:13,592
We talked about the
certificate of completion.

1128
01:30:13,599 --> 01:30:17,240
I know. But unfortunately
would be a waste of time.

1129
01:30:17,448 --> 01:30:18,539
I can not grant it to you.

1130
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:20,543
I have all the time in the world.

1131
01:30:20,554 --> 01:30:23,023
But my responsibility
is to teach something...

1132
01:30:23,493 --> 01:30:24,697
you can do.

1133
01:30:24,703 --> 01:30:27,191
I can teach. I know I can.

1134
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:28,883
No school
will accept you.

1135
01:30:28,994 --> 01:30:31,074
Not without certificate of completion.

1136
01:30:31,082 --> 01:30:32,389
Of course they will not.

1137
01:30:32,393 --> 01:30:38,160
Not the certificate.
Be realistic is your...

1138
01:30:38,164 --> 01:30:39,747
is your disability.

1139
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,783
At that time, in my life. 
My only handicap is you.

1140
01:30:43,941 --> 01:30:46,395
I want you to know that
how I feel.

1141
01:30:46,398 --> 01:30:50,820
I am a man who, after all, 
likes challenges too.

1142
01:30:50,823 --> 01:30:52,270
And what are these challenges?

1143
01:30:52,917 --> 01:30:54,625
Ora...

1144
01:30:55,004 --> 01:30:59,706
The position I occupied was a 
considerable challenge.

1145
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,476
In what sense?

1146
01:31:01,485 --> 01:31:02,528
Well...

1147
01:31:03,063 --> 01:31:06,110
I had to fight, and fight
very hard.

1148
01:31:06,118 --> 01:31:11,026
Do you know what it is to fight 
for a piece of cake?

1149
01:31:11,036 --> 01:31:13,614
Try any time without hands.

1150
01:31:13,615 --> 01:31:14,783
What does one thing have to do with the other?

1151
01:31:14,785 --> 01:31:17,175
Ever tried to slide to
the seat of a toilet...

1152
01:31:17,365 --> 01:31:19,031
without using your legs?

1153
01:31:19,035 --> 01:31:21,395
Without knowing exactly if
is in the right place or not...

1154
01:31:21,397 --> 01:31:23,842
for not being able to feel the 
porcelain underneath.

1155
01:31:23,843 --> 01:31:24,980
Miss Kinmont.

1156
01:31:24,987 --> 01:31:26,659
Do not try to flatter me.

1157
01:31:26,842 --> 01:31:28,941
I'm just trying to
show that...

1158
01:31:28,946 --> 01:31:31,181
Have you ever felt an itch on your 
nose and could not...

1159
01:31:31,192 --> 01:31:33,056
- achieve it to scratch?
- Enough!

1160
01:31:33,304 --> 01:31:35,281
Not enough, no sir.

1161
01:31:35,283 --> 01:31:37,667
Do you want to listen to the 
respect of challenges?

1162
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:40,677
I teach you the meaning
of the word.

1163
01:31:40,684 --> 01:31:42,928
It's okay. You have proved your thesis.

1164
01:31:43,332 --> 01:31:46,292
Let me introduce
mine.

1165
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:50,677
Paraplegics are not accepted
as teachers in absolutely...

1166
01:31:50,888 --> 01:31:53,420
No school in this country.

1167
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:56,781
Unless you find
one who wants to hire you...

1168
01:31:56,783 --> 01:32:01,509
I will not allow you to receive 
the certificate of completion.

1169
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:04,170
Do you allow me to?

1170
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:06,683
You have my word
of honor.

1171
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:13,471
The school I had in mind
and that no one could imagine...

1172
01:32:13,472 --> 01:32:16,996
It was the Indians' school there 
in my town, Bishop.

1173
01:32:16,997 --> 01:32:19,843
I went there and said that if they
wanted teachers...

1174
01:32:19,844 --> 01:32:23,107
Qualified would have to accept me as I was.

1175
01:32:27,282 --> 01:32:30,126
What did they say?

1176
01:32:31,274 --> 01:32:33,889
They said yes. She's going to 
be the teacher.

1177
01:32:36,786 --> 01:32:38,664
Come on.

1178
01:32:40,551 --> 01:32:44,049
It was the beginning.
I started a new life.

1179
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:46,485
You could depend on me again
same time again and...

1180
01:32:46,896 --> 01:32:50,661
open my way.

1181
01:32:50,662 --> 01:32:54,475
Dick. Hey, are you okay?

1182
01:32:54,478 --> 01:32:56,403
<i>Yes, that's okay.</i>

1183
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:58,692
I want you to come to my birthday.

1184
01:32:58,694 --> 01:33:00,004
<i>Your birthday?</i>

1185
01:33:00,031 --> 01:33:02,366
Is not it great for
birthday parties?

1186
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:04,522
I have something to tell you.

1187
01:33:04,983 --> 01:33:06,958
<i>Speak!</i>

1188
01:33:06,967 --> 01:33:09,275
Can not, just say
when you come.

1189
01:33:09,277 --> 01:33:12,446
- I will not wait. You'll have to wait.

1190
01:33:13,389 --> 01:33:15,284
Jill, help me to
understand this.

1191
01:33:15,285 --> 01:33:18,882
You make a
long distance call...

1192
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:21,113
To say no-can talk to me.

1193
01:33:21,723 --> 01:33:23,843
<i>What is happening with you?</i>

1194
01:33:23,844 --> 01:33:26,555
<i>Jill?
Hello?</i>

1195
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:29,434
Hello? Hello?

1196
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:32,102
Okay, I say now.

1197
01:33:34,664 --> 01:33:43,821
I love you and I want to marry you.

1198
01:33:43,824 --> 01:33:45,867
I will charge this.

1199
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:50,465
Do not start this party without me.

1200
01:33:50,466 --> 01:33:53,047
Very well, Linda. Soft, like that.

1201
01:33:53,055 --> 01:33:56,856
While waiting for Dick,
I went back up the mountain.

1202
01:33:56,884 --> 01:33:59,771
And there, in full
snow station...

1203
01:33:59,925 --> 01:34:04,601
I saw perfectly that life had 
gone on without me.

1204
01:34:04,901 --> 01:34:06,896
Okay, you have to
keep them straight, right?

1205
01:34:06,905 --> 01:34:09,530
And work with your knees,
okay?

1206
01:34:15,521 --> 01:34:17,456
Who would believe that.

1207
01:34:21,349 --> 01:34:23,334
What are you thinking about?

1208
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:27,676
That I am a
lucky girl.

1209
01:34:34,984 --> 01:34:38,123
Calm down. He'll be there soon, teacher.

1210
01:34:38,132 --> 01:34:41,891
It will be difficult to call you that.

1211
01:34:41,898 --> 01:34:43,707
- More gifts?
- More gifts.

1212
01:34:43,717 --> 01:34:45,627
But you will not open
none of those present...

1213
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:47,981
while it does not arrive.

1214
01:34:57,678 --> 01:34:59,283
Any sign of the red baron?

1215
01:35:07,274 --> 01:35:09,056
Soda Springs Airport?

1216
01:35:09,559 --> 01:35:11,271
I wanted to know if you
can tell me when...

1217
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:13,735
Dick Buek took off.

1218
01:35:15,379 --> 01:35:19,271
Two days? No. It's that we're 
waiting for him here...

1219
01:35:19,512 --> 01:35:21,603
this morning, just this.

1220
01:35:21,608 --> 01:35:25,528
I'm sure
he will arrive. Thank you.

1221
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:30,258
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JILL.

1222
01:35:33,358 --> 01:35:36,060
He is the best pilot in the whole 
world, do not you think?

1223
01:35:48,195 --> 01:35:50,618
I'm sure he caught a storm.

1224
01:35:50,633 --> 01:35:52,202
It should arrive soon.

1225
01:35:52,353 --> 01:35:54,824
He really likes to
scare people.

1226
01:35:55,358 --> 01:35:58,485
Yes. This guy loves dramatic entries.

1227
01:36:13,668 --> 01:36:16,469
Hello?

1228
01:36:18,144 --> 01:36:21,302
It's him! It's Mr. Buek,
of Soda Springs.

1229
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:25,285
He did not leave the house. 
He must have come back.

1230
01:36:25,826 --> 01:36:28,500
Yes. It's from here. Hello, Dick.

1231
01:36:37,488 --> 01:36:39,737
It is Dick's father.
He wants to talk to you.

1232
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:45,202
Someone takes me outside.

1233
01:36:45,203 --> 01:36:48,240
Bobby, take me out there, please?

1234
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:53,887
- I'll go with you.
- No mother. I prefer to be alone.

1235
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:05,422
Hello. Yes. This is Bill Kinmont.

1236
01:37:11,376 --> 01:37:15,499
Oh, yes.
I get it.

1237
01:37:18,867 --> 01:37:22,171
I... I'm sorry.

1238
01:37:22,866 --> 01:37:25,778
Very much.

1239
01:37:29,103 --> 01:37:33,456
Yes, I tell her.

1240
01:37:33,637 --> 01:37:35,651
Can we do anything?

1241
01:37:38,772 --> 01:37:45,703
We loved him very much.

1242
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:48,093
We will miss you a lot.

1243
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:21,054
- Has anyone asked? You asked for what?

1244
01:38:21,815 --> 01:38:23,657
- In marriage.
- Yes.  If asked, why not accept.

1245
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:32,885
It's time for us to come back.

1246
01:38:33,037 --> 01:38:35,641
Let's go, kids!
Let's go!

1247
01:38:45,561 --> 01:38:49,367
I try to avoid this, but sometimes,
everything comes back to my head

1248
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:53,754
And when it comes back, I remember
of the words that Dick Buek...

1249
01:38:53,919 --> 01:38:57,102
He told me about the last time I saw him.

1250
01:38:57,108 --> 01:39:01,141
How happy I am to have met someone like you.

1251
01:39:02,118 --> 01:39:05,108
It's awful to have to say goodbye.

1252
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,726
Jill Kinmont is now teaching elementary 
school in Southern California

1253
01:40:51,442 --> 01:40:54,172
She died in 2012 at 75 years old.
