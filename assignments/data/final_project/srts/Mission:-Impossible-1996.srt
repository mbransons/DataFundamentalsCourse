1
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:28,623
It was good ...

2
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,753
... that you called us.

3
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:37,383
I don't know what happened.

4
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:41,345
We were at the bar...

5
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:47,101
... drinking, having fun ...

6
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:52,774
I don't even know how I got there.

7
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,028
Come on, she's been under too long.

8
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:00,991
You're the only one who can help me.

9
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:08,082
Come on, come on ...

10
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:13,963
- Tell me what I need to know.
- They'll kill me.

11
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:20,970
You asked for my help.

12
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,889
Come on.

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,478
The contact in Minsk ...

14
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,148
Give us the name.

15
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,528
Dimitri ... Miediev.

16
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:56,007
- What now?
- Now we drink.

17
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:58,218
To friends.

18
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,326
Get rid of that scum.

19
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,743
- Did we get it?
- We got it.

20
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:02,975
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Rosen?

21
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:12,653
- Care to watch a movie, Mr Phelps?
- No, I prefer the theatre.

22
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:17,240
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

23
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,953
Perhaps you'd choose one for me.

24
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,124
Thank you.

25
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:54,822
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.
This is Alexander Golitsyn, -

26
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:59,952
- an attachÃ© at our embassy
in Prague. He is also a traitor.

27
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:03,498
He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list -

28
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:07,002
- of all our deep cover agents
in Eastern Europe.

29
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:11,673
For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.

30
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:15,260
The portion Golitsyn has
contains code names.

31
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,891
It is useless without its mate, which
matches the codes with true names.

32
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:27,440
It is this half Golitsyn plans to steal
at an embassy reception tomorrow.

33
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,820
Your mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to obtain proof of the theft.

34
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,659
Shadow Golitsyn to his buyer
and apprehend them both.

35
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:41,747
I've dispatched a team
selected from your group.

36
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:47,002
Sarah Davies is undercover now. Jack
Harmon can hack into their system.

37
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:52,216
Hannah Williams will do surveillance.
Your wife, Claire, will cover transport.

38
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:56,471
And Ethan Hunt
will be your pointman, as usual.

39
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:01,017
He is now in Kiev and
will rendezvous with you in Prague.

40
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:05,730
Should any member of your IM force
be caught or killed, -

41
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,944
- the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.

42
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:14,698
This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.

43
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,724
A very straightforward objective.

44
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:44,438
We photograph Golitsyn stealing the
NOC list, follow him to his buyer, -

45
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,777
- apprehend both of them.
Now, here's the plot. Ethan ...

46
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:55,241
You go into the embassy in character,
during a party. Hide in plain sight.

47
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,787
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

48
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:04,293
Sarah, you're there as the embassy's
Washington visitors' liaison.

49
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:07,421
You and Ethan will run the game.

50
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:13,260
- I haven't a thing to wear.
- Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

51
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:22,103
Mark Golitsyn and hand him off
to Hannah. Hannah, you stay on him.

52
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:27,608
Jack, fingerprint security is accessed
through the elevator shaft here.

53
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:34,199
- So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.
- Open, close, get out.

54
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,703
Claire, you're in the vehicle.

55
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:43,584
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior. You two stay on him.

56
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,588
If I call "abort",
everybody walk away immediately.

57
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:51,926
Regroup here at 4:00 a.m.

58
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:55,513
Any questions?

59
00:07:55,764 --> 00:08:01,144
Can we get a cappuccino machine?
I don't know what you call this.

60
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:05,816
- I call it cruel and unusual.
- I made that coffee.

61
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:10,279
Is it possible that it's worse
than the sludge you made in Kiev?

62
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:16,577
- Hey, take it easy on my wife's coffee.
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.

63
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:21,332
- Off on a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you at the Plaza?

64
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,336
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

65
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:29,341
- Punishing! 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

66
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:32,344
He's getting soft in his old age.

67
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:36,848
Okay, listen. If that list
gets out into the open, -

68
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,021
- the names of our agents will be
up for grabs to the highest bidders.

69
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:49,570
Terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords.
Everyone who wants to get rid of us.

70
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,574
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

71
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,292
I'll run the whole show from here.
Let's punch out the details.

72
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:08,007
There's a camera built into the bridge.
It transmits what you see back here.

73
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:15,473
Can you hear me?
No, you need an earpiece.

74
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:24,107
You have lovely eyes ...
Can you hear me now?

75
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:29,488
If he has a car waiting, and he rolls,
stay with him no matter what.

76
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:36,579
- You should check out these streets.
- What do you think I've been doing?

77
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:40,374
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

78
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:45,756
- Isn't he chairing a hearing?
- Not this week.

79
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:52,054
This week he's fly-fishing in County
Kildare with one of our lrish guides.

80
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:56,183
And he won't be back anytime soon.

81
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:04,275
Senator, it sounds as lf
you want to lead the kind of charge -

82
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:11,908
- that Sen. Church led in the 70's, and
destroy the US's intelligence capability.

83
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:16,913
I want to know who they are and how
they're spending the taxpayers'money.

84
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:20,709
This is still a democracy.

85
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:27,591
Stick of gum, right?
No. Red light, green light.

86
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:32,805
You have a lock you can't pick,
you mash them together ...

87
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:38,186
Hasta lasagne, don't get any on ya'.
You'll have about five seconds.

88
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:43,149
Just don't chew it.

89
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:24,234
Ethan, Jack's inside.
Let's go.

90
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,369
How do you do, Senator?
How was the opera?

91
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:39,542
- It was boring.
- Let me see if I can steer you through.

92
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:57,436
- Windows open by 2300.
- Mr Brandl, the mayor, and Mrs Brandl.

93
00:11:57,686 --> 00:12:02,609
Senator,
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

94
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:08,031
- Of course. How are you, Ms Norman?
- He's in pocket, on the stairway.

95
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:14,871
Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you.

96
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:19,126
Hannah.

97
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:24,674
Pull the shade.

98
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:37,312
Sarah, mark the package
and go to two.

99
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:47,948
Your advance team said you'd like
a tour of the facility. This way.

100
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:01,045
Oh, great.

101
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:07,219
... which leads to the Denied Area,
the only limited access area here.

102
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,123
Governor's in position now.

103
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:49,597
- Can I help you?
- As you can see, there's surveillance.

104
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:53,726
I'm sorry,
I know it's in here somewhere.

105
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,980
Sergeant, why are you not in uniform?

106
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,984
We've been ordered
to wear civilian clothes, sir.

107
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:06,448
Be right back.

108
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:13,665
- Do you have a Jack on your staff?
- I believe we did.

109
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:19,253
An unreliable fellow, as I recall.
Constantly late and behind in his work.

110
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:28,346
We were forced to tie him to a horse
and drag him around mybarn.

111
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:30,766
I'm working on it.

112
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:48,451
Sorry.
Thank you. Have a nice evening.

113
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:03,634
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

114
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,208
Higher.

115
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,591
He's heading to the Denied Area.

116
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:48,264
Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you.

117
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:00,319
Jack ...

118
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:05,074
Jack, we're in position here.

119
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,785
I didn't touch it.

120
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:14,793
- What about my coat? I'll freeze.
- Jack, open the doors.

121
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:26,305
He's in the box, Ethan.

122
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:30,518
- We'll take his exit. Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

123
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,939
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

124
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,571
- He's got it.
- All right.

125
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:25,409
- I saved your ass again, Jack.
- Such a nice ass.

126
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:29,621
- And a lonely ass.
- Transport in five minutes.

127
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:19,633
Jack, we're in position. Open the doors
and let the package roll.

128
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:25,139
Stairway, you're wrapped.
Go to transport.

129
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,193
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

130
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:47,079
I don't have control, Jack.
Cut the power.

131
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,711
- Cut the power.
- Come on, Jack.

132
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,682
Jack ...

133
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,438
Jack ...
Jack?

134
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:16,986
- Jack, do you copy?
- Man down, Ethan.

135
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:19,905
Man down.

136
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:43,388
Ethan, stay where you are.
I'm coming to you.

137
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,824
The package is out in the open.

138
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:08,666
- Jim, he's in the open.
- En route.

139
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,690
Jim, he's in the open.

140
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,153
Jim, the package is in the open.

141
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:43,703
I've got a shadow.
I can't lose him. Abort!

142
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:47,373
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

143
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,631
- I can't do that.
- We're being ambushed. Abort!

144
00:20:54,881 --> 00:21:00,220
- Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.
- No, dammit, I said abort!

145
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:14,402
- Eye on the package. Jim, I'm coming.
- Jim gave an abort.

146
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:20,491
We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me? Now go!

147
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:56,321
- Where are you?
- 200 yards from the bridge.

148
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:59,157
They're covering the frequency.

149
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:03,245
Cut all radio communication.

150
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:30,482
Ethan ...

151
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:06,312
Sarah, abort.
Repeat: abort!

152
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:12,152
Abort! Do you read me?

153
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:18,950
Sarah ...

154
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:54,363
Oh my God!

155
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:46,231
- Satcom 7.
- Central Europe, unsecured.

156
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:50,694
- Designator?
- Bravo, echo, one, one.

157
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:57,535
- This is Kittridge.
- Go secure.

158
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:02,999
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

159
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:07,712
- Who's dead?
- My team. My team is dead!

160
00:26:07,962 --> 00:26:14,178
Golitsyn's gone. They knew
we were coming. The disk is gone.

161
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:19,642
- Are you intact?
- The list is in the open!

162
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:25,147
Let's just bring you in safely,
then we'll worry about that.

163
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:30,529
- Were you followed?
- I don't think so.

164
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,907
Don't think. Be sure.
Are you clean?

165
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,201
Yes.

166
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:41,164
Location Green, one hour.
I'llbe there myself.

167
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:44,377
- You're in Prague?
- One hour.

168
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:45,649
I ... I can't tell you how sorry I am.

169
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,781
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you.

170
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:56,453
- Personally as well as professionally.
- Yeah ...

171
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,753
Here's a passport and visa. Usual drill.

172
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:08,049
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada -

173
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:12,345
- and throw the Prague police a bone,
toss them a few suspects.

174
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:22,689
- You follow me?
- Yeah, I follow you.

175
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:29,697
- We've lost enough agents for tonight.
- You mean, I have.

176
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,037
- You're bent on blaming yourself.
- Who else is left?

177
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:42,502
Yeah, I see your point.

178
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:50,885
- Why was there another team?
- What?

179
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:55,432
The IMF agents at the embassy.

180
00:28:57,351 --> 00:29:00,813
I don't quite follow you.

181
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:05,276
Then follow me around the room.

182
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:10,322
The drunk Russians on
the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock.

183
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:17,873
The couple waltzing around me,
the waiter standing behind Hannah.

184
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:22,753
Bow tie at 12 o'clock.
The other IMF team.

185
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:25,922
You're worried about me. Why?

186
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,638
For two years
we've been spotting a blowback -

187
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:36,392
- in IMF operations.
We have a penetration.

188
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:41,731
We've decoded an lnternet message
from a Czech we know as "Max'.

189
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:45,193
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

190
00:29:45,443 --> 00:29:52,951
Max has a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

191
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:59,625
This time he got on the inside,
in a position to buy our NOC list.

192
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:05,882
An operation he called "Job 3-14". He
thought Golitsyn was doing it tonight.

193
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:13,807
- The list he stole was a decoy.
- That's correct.

194
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:18,728
The actual list is secure at Langley.
Golitsyn was one of ours.

195
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:26,195
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

196
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:35,746
- The whole operation was a mole hunt.
- Yeah.

197
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:41,461
The mole's deep inside.

198
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:47,384
And like you said ...

199
00:30:47,634 --> 00:30:50,303
... you survived.

200
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:54,892
I want to show you something.

201
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:01,941
Since your father's death, your
family's farm has been in receivership.

202
00:31:02,191 --> 00:31:06,112
Suddenly, they have 120 grand
in the bank.

203
00:31:06,362 --> 00:31:10,117
The illness was supposed to have
wiped out that account.

204
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:15,998
Dying slowly in America can be
a very expensive proposition.

205
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:24,173
So why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

206
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:31,973
- I can understand you're very upset.
- You've never seen me very upset.

207
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,642
Enough is enough.

208
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:39,481
You've bribed and killed,
using loyalties on the inside.

209
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:44,445
You want to shake hands with the
devil? Fine, but you'll do it in hell.

210
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:48,409
Money, money ...
Where's the damn money?

211
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:20,985
We've decoded an lnternet message
from a Czech we know as "Max".

212
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:27,117
He got in a position to buy our NOC
list. An operation he called "Job 3-14".

213
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:45,658
"... asleep and at rest with kings
and counsellors of the earth ..."

214
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:51,206
You son of a bitch.

215
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:32,980
Ethan ...

216
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,653
What are you doing?
I needed you.

217
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:42,074
On the bridge.

218
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:45,660
But you weren't there.

219
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:05,139
- Don't move.
- Ethan ...

220
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:15,484
- You were in the car.
- No, I wasn't.

221
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:22,908
- I heard on the radio ...
- I saw you, you were in the car.

222
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:28,373
No, I got out of the car. I ran to
the bridge. He said someone was ...

223
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:33,086
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.
There was nobody there.

224
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:39,050
- What happened to Jim?
- Wake up! Jim's dead! They're all dead!

225
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:50,980
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead ...

226
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:57,027
Take off your coat.

227
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:15,214
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

228
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:22,180
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you? Did they send you?

229
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,017
No one sent me.

230
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:31,940
We were supposed to be back here
at four o'clock if we abort.

231
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:36,779
0400. Four a.m. Four o'clock.
It's four o'clock.

232
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:40,949
If we abort ... four a.m.

233
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:04,015
I've been disavowed.

234
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:13,859
They actually think
I killed Jim and everyone else.

235
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:22,702
Somehow, $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

236
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:28,458
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole,
employed by an arms dealer, Max, -

237
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:33,130
- for the last two years,
to get him our NOC list.

238
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:40,138
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get it for him.

239
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:44,642
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

240
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:49,522
Whoever the mole is,
he goes by the name of Job.

241
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:54,987
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list, he'll find me.

242
00:40:55,237 --> 00:41:00,242
I'm going to go in and tell Kittridge
you have nothing to do with this.

243
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:06,415
Claire, if you're not dead,
he'll assume you're with me.

244
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:25,268
The message is for Job.

245
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:28,981
That's right.
And I'm going to answer it.

246
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:57,344
Excuse me,
could I trouble you for a match?

247
00:42:13,653 --> 00:42:16,906
Remove your hat, please.

248
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:22,454
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

249
00:42:22,704 --> 00:42:25,874
The price of admission.

250
00:42:35,343 --> 00:42:41,141
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood. No one sees Max.

251
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:47,731
- Then why the hell am I here?
- So he can hear what you have to say.

252
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:51,569
I don't communicate well
through a shroud.

253
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:57,742
If Max doesn't like what you say,
you'll be wearing it indefinitely.

254
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,830
I'm willing to take the chance.

255
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,296
Very well.

256
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:16,845
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

257
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:20,348
I need $150,000.

258
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,227
Really?

259
00:43:26,898 --> 00:43:32,487
And you thought if you simply
showed up, I might give it to you?

260
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:36,449
Why not? You gave Job 125.

261
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:43,415
The penny drops. You are not Job.

262
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:50,255
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

263
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:56,553
Its tone was aggressive but playful.
Job is not playful.

264
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:03,603
- So you are something of a paradox.
- Well, that depends.

265
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:07,732
- On what?
- Whether you like a paradox.

266
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:15,324
- I want $150,000 today.
- That's quite out of the question.

267
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:21,288
The disk Job sold you is worthless.

268
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,709
It's bait. Part of an internal mole hunt.

269
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:34,010
And how might you know that?

270
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:38,140
Are you another company man?

271
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,852
Like Job?

272
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:47,649
We're asking about you.

273
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:52,572
I'm NOC. Was ...
Now disavowed.

274
00:44:53,781 --> 00:44:58,578
- Why, may I ask?
- That's what I want to ask Job.

275
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:04,041
I don't know Job
any more than Job knows me.

276
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:08,088
You could arrange an introduction.

277
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,801
- Why should l?
- I can deliver the actual NOC list.

278
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:19,183
Your list is worthless, and it's probably
equipped with a homing device.

279
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:29,444
Boot it up. In 10 minutes you'll have the
CIA hopping around you like rabbits.

280
00:45:33,448 --> 00:45:39,538
It's easy to say it's worthless if I can't
look at it to see if it's worthless.

281
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:45,252
- Not a tenable position, sir.
- Okay, use it.

282
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:49,965
But I'd suggest you pack first.

283
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:10,237
- 26-27. So far, so good.
- Not so good for you, my friend.

284
00:46:10,487 --> 00:46:14,367
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

285
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:50,196
- 32 and 33.
- Doesn't mean it's a signal.

286
00:46:57,746 --> 00:47:01,416
44 and 45.

287
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:53,388
The man's gone black, Barnes.
He's under until he decides to surface.

288
00:47:53,639 --> 00:48:00,020
- We can cut off his transportation.
- What can we do, Barnes?

289
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,358
Put a guy at the airport?
How many identities does Hunt have?

290
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:08,696
How many times
has he slipped past customs?

291
00:48:08,947 --> 00:48:13,743
These guys are trained to be ghosts.
We taught them!

292
00:48:13,993 --> 00:48:17,330
What do you suggest?

293
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,167
Let's make him come to us.

294
00:48:21,418 --> 00:48:27,925
You find something that's personally
important to him and you squeeze.

295
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:37,560
GÃ¼nther will never let me
have one of his apartments again.

296
00:48:38,727 --> 00:48:44,067
- Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
- Thanks, Max.

297
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,488
Or is it Maxine?

298
00:48:48,738 --> 00:48:52,993
I don't have to tell you what a comfort
anonymity is in my profession.

299
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:57,622
It's like a warm blanket.

300
00:49:00,793 --> 00:49:06,215
My deal with Job was subject to
a successful boot scan. The deal's off.

301
00:49:08,342 --> 00:49:12,472
- What was your deal with Job?
- Six million dollars.

302
00:49:12,722 --> 00:49:17,603
I'll give you the same, for the
complete list, not just Eastern Europe.

303
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:21,774
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

304
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:29,072
10 million, in negotiable US Treasury
certificates, coupons attached.

305
00:49:29,323 --> 00:49:32,202
And one more thing ...

306
00:49:32,452 --> 00:49:37,415
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

307
00:49:53,682 --> 00:50:00,564
- Max made a deal with you?
- I deliver the list, Max delivers Job.

308
00:50:02,691 --> 00:50:07,155
We've 75 rounds for the Beretta,
but only 20 for the Sig-Sauer.

309
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:11,284
One pair of Visco glasses.

310
00:50:11,535 --> 00:50:14,412
Plenty of passports ...

311
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:24,507
Well, you said it yourself.
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

312
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,887
- Are you sure?
- Jim was my husband.

313
00:50:30,138 --> 00:50:34,809
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

314
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:41,066
- We need help. They'll have to be local.
- What kind of help?

315
00:51:15,478 --> 00:51:19,982
Simple game. Four players.

316
00:51:20,232 --> 00:51:24,612
Exfil opens the pocket,
cyber ops lifts the wallet.

317
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:29,159
- Bank?
- IMF mainframe.

318
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:33,997
- Where exactly is it?
- In Langley.

319
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:39,795
In Langley?
The one in Virginia?

320
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:44,883
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

321
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:48,596
- Is he serious?
- Always.

322
00:51:50,973 --> 00:51:54,769
Why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

323
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:59,232
I can fly a helicopter into the vault.

324
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:03,362
It would be easier
than breaking into the CIA.

325
00:52:03,612 --> 00:52:08,575
- What kind of information is it?
- Profitable.

326
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,372
Payment on delivery.

327
00:52:14,373 --> 00:52:18,628
I don't know.
I just don't know.

328
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:24,426
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

329
00:52:24,676 --> 00:52:29,139
What did they used to call you?
The Net Ranger?

330
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:32,267
The only man to hack NATO Ghostcom.

331
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:38,023
There was never any evidence
that I had anything to do with that ...

332
00:52:38,274 --> 00:52:41,694
... with that exceptional piece of work.

333
00:52:45,406 --> 00:52:50,870
You don't know what you're missing.
This is the Mt Everest of hacks.

334
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:57,711
You're kidding yourselves. Even with
top of the line crypto, Stu 3's ...

335
00:52:57,961 --> 00:53:03,049
- Krieger can get it. Right?
- It may take a little time.

336
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,970
That's not what Claire says about you.

337
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,309
Thinking Machine laptops.

338
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,981
The 686 prototypes,
with the artificial intelligence Risc chip.

339
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:19,984
24 hours.

340
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:24,655
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

341
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:29,870
Luther,
I guess you're all out of excuses.

342
00:53:32,748 --> 00:53:36,668
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

343
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:43,051
No modem access to a mainframe.
It's in what we call a "stand-alone".

344
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:48,765
Which means I'd have to be
physically at the terminal.

345
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:52,852
Relax, it's much worse than you think.

346
00:53:53,103 --> 00:53:55,855
It's in a black vault lock-down.

347
00:53:56,106 --> 00:54:02,530
The onlyperson allowed in the room
has to pass through security checks.

348
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:08,202
The first is a voiceprint identifiication
and a six-digit access code.

349
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,375
This only gets him into the outerroom.

350
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:18,338
Next he has to pass a retinal scan.

351
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:26,555
And the intrusion countermeasures are
deactivated by an electronic key card.

352
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,308
Which we won't have.

353
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:37,692
Inside the black vault, three systems
operate whenever the technician is out.

354
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:43,990
The first is sound sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.

355
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,493
The second system detects
any increase in temperature.

356
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:54,084
The bodyheat of an intruder will trigger
it if the temperature rises one degree.

357
00:54:58,922 --> 00:55:03,385
That temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning duct, -

358
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:07,056
- 30 feet above the floor.

359
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:10,185
That vent is guarded by a lasernet.

360
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:18,151
The third system is on the floor
and is pressure sensitive.

361
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:22,698
The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.

362
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:28,954
If any one of these systems is set off,
it will activate an automatic lock-down.

363
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:35,211
Believe me when I tell you,
all three systems are state of the art.

364
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,969
And you really think we can do this?

365
00:55:44,346 --> 00:55:46,348
We're going to do it.

366
00:56:20,092 --> 00:56:22,803
Alarms in sectors 3, 7 and 12.

367
00:56:23,053 --> 00:56:27,891
- What sector's the air conditioning?
- 21. But there's no alarm in 21.

368
00:56:34,566 --> 00:56:40,113
No one goes into any sector where the
alarm hasn't gone off, and it hasn't...

369
00:56:44,576 --> 00:56:48,539
- It's gone off. Let's go.
- Let's move.

370
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:03,513
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

371
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:08,268
21's through here.

372
00:57:14,274 --> 00:57:18,320
- He's recruiting. For what purpose?
- Survival.

373
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:23,493
Too short-sighted. This guy initiates.
The question is, what does he want?

374
00:57:23,743 --> 00:57:28,498
Where does he need to get it?
Barnes, what the hell is that noise?

375
00:57:28,748 --> 00:57:34,462
- Fire alarm, Gene.
- Do we have to evacuate?

376
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:24,890
Hey, where's the other guy?

377
00:58:28,311 --> 00:58:31,523
- Zero body count.
- We'll see.

378
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:08,376
Hi, there.

379
01:01:07,313 --> 01:01:11,817
One, two, three.

380
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:15,405
Toast, toast.

381
01:01:15,655 --> 01:01:21,077
- Check.
- Good. Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

382
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:26,166
Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?

383
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:37,887
- Damn.
- Krieger, from now on, total silence.

384
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:57,138
He's rolling to you.

385
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:03,853
- He's at the voiceprint corridor.
- William Donloe.

386
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:21,955
Outer room.

387
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:28,671
He's coming in the vault.

388
01:03:32,717 --> 01:03:35,220
Come on, move.

389
01:05:03,188 --> 01:05:06,065
He's in the bathroom.

390
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:24,524
A-W-9 -

391
01:06:24,774 --> 01:06:27,193
- 6-B-6.

392
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:48,049
Holy mother of God.

393
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,385
A NOC list.

394
01:09:47,405 --> 01:09:50,701
He's at the vault.

395
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:04,215
Four yellows.

396
01:10:07,261 --> 01:10:10,222
One red.

397
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,317
Get moving.

398
01:10:25,405 --> 01:10:27,615
Toast.

399
01:11:28,221 --> 01:11:30,516
Oh, my God.

400
01:11:46,323 --> 01:11:50,703
- It's for you.
- Kittridge.

401
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:18,107
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops.

402
01:12:18,357 --> 01:12:21,820
- It never happened.
- What about him?

403
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:26,408
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

404
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:11,664
Are you contacting your buyer?
Ethan?

405
01:13:25,094 --> 01:13:27,806
Ethan?

406
01:13:29,225 --> 01:13:32,811
Oh, excuse me. "Mr Hunt".

407
01:13:41,111 --> 01:13:45,700
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

408
01:13:45,951 --> 01:13:50,831
My contact is extremely shy.

409
01:13:51,081 --> 01:13:55,168
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders.

410
01:13:55,418 --> 01:13:58,713
- Not while I'm holding this.
- Krieger ...

411
01:13:58,964 --> 01:14:01,050
Shut up.

412
01:14:05,555 --> 01:14:09,016
- You mean this?
- That's not the list.

413
01:14:09,267 --> 01:14:12,728
You've never seen this trick?

414
01:14:20,237 --> 01:14:22,906
Where did it go?

415
01:14:25,993 --> 01:14:28,579
It's gone.

416
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:32,374
- What?
- You ... no?

417
01:14:39,424 --> 01:14:41,885
But not too far.

418
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:47,599
I know what you're thinking.

419
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:53,397
"ln the computer room, I was up here
and he was down there."

420
01:14:54,732 --> 01:14:59,570
"He was carrying two disks."

421
01:15:02,281 --> 01:15:06,493
- It's hard to keep track of these things.
- Where is it?

422
01:15:21,968 --> 01:15:26,140
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

423
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:32,021
Try any sleight of hand with my money
and I'll cut your throat.

424
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:01,469
- On a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you at the Plaza?

425
01:16:01,719 --> 01:16:05,348
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

426
01:16:06,349 --> 01:16:09,227
I'm so sorry.

427
01:16:14,108 --> 01:16:17,736
Krieger was my call.

428
01:16:22,575 --> 01:16:26,495
I'm sorry, Ethan.

429
01:16:29,415 --> 01:16:33,128
We did what we had to do.

430
01:16:33,378 --> 01:16:37,007
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

431
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:18,258
Krieger did have the NOC list?

432
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:32,232
Hold on to it. If you knew what you were
getting into, you wouldn't have done it.

433
01:17:38,531 --> 01:17:42,159
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

434
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:48,749
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow on
the train. Don't let it get out in the open.

435
01:17:55,423 --> 01:18:00,220
- What is the range of this thing?
- It's hard to tell. I'll have to be close.

436
01:18:05,976 --> 01:18:10,689
The unlikely setting, a farm in the
heartland of America, Wisconsin.

437
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:15,403
Here, Federal agents found the brains
behind an international drug ring:

438
01:18:15,653 --> 01:18:20,783
Margaret Ethan Hunt and her
brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.

439
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:26,372
They were arrested this morning
in a major sting operation -

440
01:18:26,622 --> 01:18:32,337
- designed to expose the
illegal manufacture of the drug "khat".

441
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:35,090
- What we have here is a case ...
- Kittridge.

442
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,626
I see you've been out visiting the folks.

443
01:19:08,876 --> 01:19:12,171
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

444
01:19:12,421 --> 01:19:15,424
Been watching a little TV?

445
01:19:15,674 --> 01:19:20,764
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

446
01:19:21,014 --> 01:19:23,517
- He's in England.
- Get Ml5.

447
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:28,313
My first order of business
after you come in -

448
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:34,654
- is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped.

449
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:37,698
If you come in now, -

450
01:19:37,949 --> 01:19:42,828
- we can play down
the charges against you, as well.

451
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:47,708
- Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
- Certainly, Ethan.

452
01:19:47,959 --> 01:19:50,211
If you're dealing with someone -

453
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:53,549
- who's crushed, stabbed, -

454
01:19:53,799 --> 01:19:56,510
- shot and detonated -

455
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:01,098
- fiive members ofhis own IMF team, -

456
01:20:01,348 --> 01:20:06,603
- how devastated will you make him
by arresting Ma and Uncle Donald?

457
01:20:06,854 --> 01:20:12,402
I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?

458
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:17,574
Lost him.
We needed three more seconds.

459
01:20:17,824 --> 01:20:21,619
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

460
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:38,137
You're a hard man to catch up with.

461
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:48,982
The next day I dragged myself
back to the safe house.

462
01:20:49,232 --> 01:20:53,486
- I checked our aliases.
- And you picked us up in the States.

463
01:20:53,737 --> 01:20:57,032
But you'd gone,
and I could check just so many places.

464
01:20:57,282 --> 01:21:01,746
Some European countries
don't computerise customs records.

465
01:21:01,996 --> 01:21:05,374
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

466
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:11,422
- You know I like Liverpool St. rentals.
- I showed them to you.

467
01:21:11,672 --> 01:21:14,801
I remember.

468
01:21:15,052 --> 01:21:20,974
A doctor's got to look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

469
01:21:21,225 --> 01:21:28,482
I can sit up straight. I just can't
sit up straight very well. Sit down.

470
01:21:30,192 --> 01:21:35,031
Ethan ... I saw who shot me.

471
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:38,076
I saw the mole.

472
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:41,913
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge ...

473
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:44,832
Kittridge, Ethan!

474
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:54,426
Kittridge is the mole.
My God. Of course, you're right.

475
01:22:00,808 --> 01:22:05,438
He was at the embassy that night.

476
01:22:05,689 --> 01:22:09,985
First he took out Jack, at the elevator.

477
01:22:17,909 --> 01:22:21,497
He shot you on the bridge.

478
01:23:04,918 --> 01:23:09,714
He must have had back-up to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

479
01:23:27,024 --> 01:23:30,946
How did he do Hannah?

480
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:57,682
No, he could've done Hannah himself.

481
01:24:24,502 --> 01:24:28,715
Why, Jim?
Why?

482
01:24:31,843 --> 01:24:37,182
When you think about it,
it was inevitable. No more Cold War.

483
01:24:37,391 --> 01:24:43,522
No more secrets to keep
from everyone but yourself.

484
01:24:43,772 --> 01:24:50,070
Then suddenly the President is running
the country without your permission.

485
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:56,369
The son of a bitch, how dare he?
And you realise it's over.

486
01:24:56,620 --> 01:25:02,334
You're obsolete hardware, with
a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year.

487
01:25:04,419 --> 01:25:09,425
Kittridge. We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch, big time.

488
01:25:14,513 --> 01:25:19,018
We won't have to.
He'll come after us.

489
01:25:19,268 --> 01:25:24,357
- What's going to make him do that?
- What he didn't get in Prague.

490
01:25:24,607 --> 01:25:27,986
The NOC list.

491
01:25:28,237 --> 01:25:31,240
Jesus, Ethan.

492
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:34,910
Good for you.

493
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:43,044
- We meet tomorrow, the TGV to Paris.
- Tight security. No guns. Real plus.

494
01:25:43,294 --> 01:25:48,132
I deliver the NOC list to Max,
Max delivers Job to me.

495
01:25:48,383 --> 01:25:53,972
Claire and Luther will be on the train.
Krieger will have a helicopter in Paris.

496
01:25:57,308 --> 01:25:59,979
Jim?

497
01:26:07,778 --> 01:26:11,156
I was in a cafe, waiting for you ...

498
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,078
... and there she was.

499
01:26:15,328 --> 01:26:21,001
Standing in the rain, alive and beautiful,
thinking I'm dead and gone.

500
01:26:25,005 --> 01:26:30,010
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me, to keep going.

501
01:26:34,557 --> 01:26:38,394
She can't know about me. No one can.
Not till this is over.

502
01:26:38,644 --> 01:26:44,358
- You're probably right.
- There's too much at stake.

503
01:26:44,609 --> 01:26:49,948
Once we leave the safe house,
you get in there and crash.

504
01:26:50,198 --> 01:26:54,161
- I'll call from Paris.
- You got it.

505
01:27:17,185 --> 01:27:20,188
What happened?

506
01:27:22,524 --> 01:27:26,528
I sent the message to Max.

507
01:27:28,822 --> 01:27:32,534
We're on for tomorrow.

508
01:27:38,165 --> 01:27:40,752
Okay.

509
01:27:50,053 --> 01:27:52,597
Come here.

510
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:36,895
- What's this?
- Incoming for you.

511
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:40,940
X-ray's clean. Non-explosive.

512
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:54,538
Gene.

513
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:02,214
How long to the London terminus?
We've got 10 minutes. Move!

514
01:29:40,963 --> 01:29:44,174
- Give me Max.
- It's him.

515
01:29:47,928 --> 01:29:52,850
- This was not what we discussed.
- My apologies. It couldn't be helped.

516
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,396
You'll find the disk under your seat.

517
01:30:31,516 --> 01:30:38,148
Dear boy, I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

518
01:30:38,398 --> 01:30:43,863
- Not if you tell me where the money is.
- The mere chance is worth 10 million.

519
01:30:44,113 --> 01:30:49,994
Baggage car, rack 3,
silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

520
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:55,708
- What about Job?
- I wouldn't worry, he'll find you.

521
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:16,898
- What's the matter?
- It's not transmitting.

522
01:31:17,148 --> 01:31:22,195
We've got to get this through
before we hit the tunnel.

523
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:39,088
- What's the problem?
- "Connection denied."

524
01:31:39,338 --> 01:31:43,759
- Did you check the batteries?
- I always check the batteries.

525
01:31:44,009 --> 01:31:47,221
Run it through from the top.

526
01:31:49,641 --> 01:31:53,019
We don't know what Max looks like.

527
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:59,359
If he's got that list, he'll want
to check it. That means laptops.

528
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:13,165
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

529
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:25,220
- Is everything all right?
- It's working.

530
01:32:36,523 --> 01:32:38,650
He's in the baggage car.

531
01:32:39,986 --> 01:32:46,659
- Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.
- I'll meet you in the baggage car.

532
01:33:03,427 --> 01:33:05,471
Barnes.

533
01:33:42,635 --> 01:33:47,432
Ethan's right behind me.
Listen, Jim ...

534
01:33:47,683 --> 01:33:50,435
Is it such a good idea to kill him?

535
01:33:54,439 --> 01:33:57,109
Kittridge is here.

536
01:33:59,945 --> 01:34:03,950
We take the money,
Ethan takes the blame.

537
01:34:06,452 --> 01:34:09,914
No one else has seen you alive.

538
01:34:11,165 --> 01:34:13,918
No one will believe him.

539
01:34:41,197 --> 01:34:46,995
Of course, I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

540
01:34:49,122 --> 01:34:54,712
- Ethan.
- Yes, Ethan Hunt. You remember him.

541
01:34:57,924 --> 01:35:02,720
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

542
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:07,433
When he knew is a good question.
Mind telling me, Ethan?

543
01:35:07,683 --> 01:35:10,938
Before or after I showed up in London?

544
01:35:12,189 --> 01:35:16,735
Before London. After you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

545
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,448
They stamped it, didn't they?
Damned Gideons.

546
01:35:22,908 --> 01:35:26,746
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why ..?

547
01:35:26,996 --> 01:35:31,876
Why the masquerade?
Why take the risk?

548
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:36,506
You've asked the question ...
and you are the answer.

549
01:35:36,756 --> 01:35:41,761
- I knew about Jim.
- But he didn't know about you.

550
01:35:42,011 --> 01:35:47,268
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

551
01:35:47,518 --> 01:35:51,063
But I was confident,
having tasted the goods.

552
01:35:53,274 --> 01:35:57,528
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife."

553
01:36:00,198 --> 01:36:04,995
- Let's just get the money and get out.
- Yes, let's get the money.

554
01:36:05,245 --> 01:36:09,165
Ethan, the money.

555
01:36:10,709 --> 01:36:14,337
Give her the money.

556
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:19,343
You've earned it.

557
01:36:25,057 --> 01:36:29,895
- All 10 million.
- Claire was wrong about one thing.

558
01:36:30,146 --> 01:36:33,108
Oh, what's that?

559
01:36:52,462 --> 01:36:55,924
Good morning, Mr Phelps.

560
01:36:56,174 --> 01:36:59,969
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

561
01:37:01,846 --> 01:37:05,976
- You son of a bitch.
- It's over, Jim.

562
01:37:12,191 --> 01:37:15,778
- Don't. Don't, Jim.
- "Don't, Jim"?

563
01:40:31,402 --> 01:40:37,450
No, he's in the tunnel.
He'll crash into us! Accelerate!

564
01:42:39,955 --> 01:42:43,667
Red light ... green light.

565
01:43:36,473 --> 01:43:40,394
I think this is what you're looking for.

566
01:43:45,274 --> 01:43:47,527
Hello, Max.

567
01:43:47,777 --> 01:43:53,366
My lawyers will have a field day with it.
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict ...

568
01:43:53,616 --> 01:43:57,745
Maybe we'll just leave the courts
out of this one.

569
01:43:59,664 --> 01:44:03,419
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

570
01:44:04,795 --> 01:44:09,466
In a freak accident, a helicopter
lost altitude, veered into a tunnel, -

571
01:44:09,717 --> 01:44:13,512
- and collided with a high-speed train.

572
01:44:13,762 --> 01:44:19,101
The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt...

573
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:26,109
- You call your folks? How do they feel?
- About what?

574
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:32,699
The Justice Department apology,
VIP treatment, the whole nine yards.

575
01:44:32,949 --> 01:44:40,291
My mom didn't know how the DEA
mistook them for drug smugglers.

576
01:44:43,252 --> 01:44:47,256
- Cheers.
- To you, Luther.

577
01:44:47,506 --> 01:44:52,261
- And being off the disavowed list.
- Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.

578
01:44:54,556 --> 01:44:58,727
Why don't you come back with me?

579
01:44:58,977 --> 01:45:02,814
I just don't know why
I'd be doing it.

580
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:10,490
I've got to catch my flight ...
How does it feel to be a solid citizen?

581
01:45:12,909 --> 01:45:19,290
Man, I don't know.
I'm going to miss being disreputable.

582
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:24,796
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll always think of you that way.

583
01:45:35,557 --> 01:45:38,727
Excuse me, Mr Hunt.

584
01:45:38,978 --> 01:45:42,147
Would you like to watch a movie?

585
01:45:42,398 --> 01:45:45,568
No, thank you.

586
01:45:45,819 --> 01:45:51,449
Would you consider the cinema
of the Caribbean?

587
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,661
Aruba, perhaps.
