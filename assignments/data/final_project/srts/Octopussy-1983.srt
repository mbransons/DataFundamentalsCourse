1
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,373
- You didn't say there'd be such security.
- They moved the flight forward.

2
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,492
We'll have to go ahead
as planned anyway.

3
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,339
Toro? Sounds like a load of bull.

4
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,690
James.

5
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,052
Be careful.

6
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,898
Well, small world. You're a Toro, too.

7
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,889
I'll see you in Miami.

8
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,449
Fill her up.

9
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,408
EAST BERLIN

10
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,612
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.

11
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,812
We should go, my dear.

12
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,613
Well...

13
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,573
You become more beautiful every day.

14
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,453
- I'm over here.
- Of course you are.

15
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,811
This is Miss Penelope Smallbone,
my new assistant.

16
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,692
Miss Smallbone.

17
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,133
What can I say, Moneypenny? Except that
she is as attractive and as charming...

18
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,535
- As I used to be?
- I didn't say that.

19
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,890
You're such a flatterer, James.

20
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,491
Moneypenny, you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you.

21
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,293
So you've told me.

22
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,052
- Welcome to Universal Exports.
- Take it, dear.

23
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,809
- That's all you'll ever get from him.
- Thank you, Commander Bond.

24
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,694
- Do you know me?
- Miss Moneypenny described you.

25
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,334
In nauseating detail.

26
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,337
Really?

27
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,896
I can see you're going
to fit in here very nicely.

28
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,455
- Good morning, 007.
- Morning, sir.

29
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,332
- Minister.
- Commander.

30
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,258
I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.

31
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,336
- Yes. Hello, Jim.
- James.

32
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,089
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a Fabergé egg, sir.

33
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,293
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Fabergé
as a gift for the Russian royal family.

34
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,297
They're priceless and very rare.

35
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,738
This one contains a model
of the imperial state coach.

36
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,612
- Top marks, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

37
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,810
Except it's a fake.

38
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,853
There's the real thing. It's being
auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.

39
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,733
This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.

40
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,536
It's from none of the usual sources.
Anonymous seller, Swiss bank account.

41
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,175
I'd say that the vendor was a Russian.

42
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,737
And now this turns up.
A near-perfect forgery.

43
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,772
I think Commander Bond
should accompany you to the sale.

44
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,051
Splendid. I could use
an extra pair of eyes.

45
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,136
We could try and spot the seller.

46
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,651
They usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price.

47
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,892
Thank you, Fanning.

48
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,976
Not at all.

49
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,336
If it is the Russians,
it may be an effort to raise currency

50
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,258
for covert operations abroad
or for payoffs.

51
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,895
Either way,
we'd better find out what they're up to.

52
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,739
- Yes, Minister.
- Eyes only, 007.

53
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,090
Operation Trove.

54
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,336
You'll be replacing 009.

55
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,090
He turned up dead in East Germany
with that egg in his hand.

56
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,256
There's not much to go on.

57
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,655
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.

58
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,296
"Property of a Lady."

59
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,848
Next on the agenda is the continuing
mutual disarmament talks with NATO.

60
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,372
I assume you've all read
General Gogol's report.

61
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,217
It seems very thorough.

62
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,729
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

63
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,569
I believe I express the opinion
of everyone present

64
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,809
that adoption of NATO proposals does
not compromise our defensive position.

65
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,128
- Comrade Chairman.
- General Orlov.

66
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,172
General Gogol is presumptuous.

67
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,019
He speaks for himself and others

68
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,852
who cling to timid, outdated
and unrealistic policies.

69
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,177
Must I remind you, the committee,

70
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,169
of our overwhelming superiority
over NATO forces

71
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,860
before we give it away?

72
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,573
In East Germany
under my direct command,

73
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,138
I have 31 divisions,
including 11 tank divisions

74
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,979
and another five in Czechoslovakia.

75
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,855
In support, on the Russian western
border are 60 divisions,

76
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,450
including 22 tank divisions.

77
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,095
In all, a 10-1 advantage.

78
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,815
American and West German forces
can field at most ten armoured divisions.

79
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,377
The British maintain only a token force.

80
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,970
We have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new Kutuzov computer

81
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,255
and find that a lightning thrust by
ten armoured divisions from the north,

82
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:27,411
and by five more through Czechoslovakia,
lead to total victory in five days

83
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,533
against any possible defence scenario.

84
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,650
This is absolute madness.

85
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,532
We know where it will end.

86
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,369
NATO will counterattack
with nuclear weapons.

87
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,853
Never.

88
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,370
The West is decadent and divided.

89
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,015
It has no stomach
to risk our atomic reprisals.

90
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,092
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.

91
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,495
I see no reason to risk war

92
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,296
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest.

93
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,692
We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic problems.

94
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,369
- General Gogol, let me remind you...
- Comrades, sit down.

95
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,492
- I wish to tell you...
- Both of you.

96
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,252
World socialism
will be achieved peaceably.

97
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,372
Our military role is strictly defensive.

98
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,253
Is that understood, General Orlov?

99
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,820
General Gogol, would you continue?

100
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,089
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. I will
now turn to the specifics of my report...

101
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,815
Tell him I will be there
as quickly as possible.

102
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,330
Please. Please.

103
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,815
- I am trying to concentrate.
- Lenkin.

104
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,619
- What is it?
- It's terrible news, Comrade General.

105
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,096
The reproduction
has been stolen in transit.

106
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,769
The thief was dealt with,
but the egg was lost in the river.

107
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,336
Your incompetence will destroy us all.

108
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,055
- We'll have a replacement made.
- There is no time, Comrade General.

109
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,968
I have just been informed of
an unscheduled inventory in two days.

110
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,852
Control yourself.

111
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,337
I'll tell our London people
we must have the genuine egg back.

112
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,730
I hope we can reach them in time.

113
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,096
Sold to Busoni.

114
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,378
The next lot is number 48.

115
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,254
A superb green-gold
lmperial Easter egg by Carl Fabergé.

116
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,573
Enamelled in translucent green,
enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.

117
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,693
Set with blue sapphires and
four petalled gold flowers with diamonds.

118
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,133
- How much should it fetch?
- Ł250-300,000. Anything more'd be crazy.

119
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,536
...used by Tsar Nicholas
in 1897 in Moscow.

120
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,172
Property of a Lady.

121
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,532
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.

122
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,539
She wouldn't have to be here in person.
She could be represented by proxy.

123
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,175
I'll start it at Ł150,000.

124
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,410
150, 60.

125
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,254
170. 170.

126
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,295
180, 190.

127
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,933
200. Against you, madam.

128
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,620
- Any more?
- Now there is a lady.

129
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,776
Ł220,000.

130
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,492
240.

131
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,054
James, stick to the business in hand.

132
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,812
Ł260,000.

133
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,532
280.

134
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,571
Ł300,000.

135
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,733
And 20?

136
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,850
Are you bidding, sir?

137
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,132
Ł320,000. New bidder.

138
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,817
- That's interesting.
- You know him?

139
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,057
Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.

140
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,138
Marginal quality from dubious sources.

141
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,979
Ł380,000.

142
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,695
- 400 in the centre.
- Well, that should do it.

143
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,130
- Kamal has gone over the top.
- Your bid, sir. 400,000.

144
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,856
400,000. Any more?

145
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,293
425. New bidder.

146
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,376
Thank you, sir.

147
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,775
- 425.
- Have you gone mad?

148
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,770
Let's see how badly he wants it.

149
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,052
450?

150
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,737
450. 475?

151
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,889
The bid is 450. 475?

152
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,049
Against you, sir. No more than 450.

153
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,338
- Jim?
- The bid is Ł450,000.

154
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,696
I have 475.

155
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,170
Ł500,000.

156
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,292
I have half a million pounds. All done?

157
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,776
Any more?

158
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,339
Yours, sir, for Ł500,000.

159
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,292
- The next lot is...
- We could have been stuck with it.

160
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,651
- I doubt it. He had to buy it.
- But why?

161
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,499
That's what I intend to find out.

162
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,011
You had no business bidding for that egg.

163
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,370
What would you have done if you'd got it?

164
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,175
I would have claimed it was a fake, sir,
and not paid.

165
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,097
Not paid?

166
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,532
Here's the original. I switched it
with the fake during the auction.

167
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,616
Good God.

168
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,940
And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?

169
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,894
Well, he complains. If he's legitimate.

170
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,216
- Well?
- I don't think he will complain.

171
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,094
According to Fanning,
this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.

172
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,688
I believe that the fake will smoke him out.

173
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,018
Our tail followed him to Heathrow
where he caught a plane to Delhi.

174
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,096
You must go there, too.

175
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,452
I'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station I,
to keep him under surveillance.

176
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,858
- Book yourself on the next flight out.
- Well, I've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.

177
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,216
- Oh, Bond?
- Sir?

178
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,255
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.
It's government property now.

179
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,375
Of course, sir.

180
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,698
Charming tune.
You do take English money?

181
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,890
Only gold sovereigns.

182
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,976
Please.

183
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,812
I'm Vijay.
Special expediter, Universal Exports.

184
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,613
- Welcome to India, Commander Bond.
- Call me James.

185
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,777
- Where's Sadruddin?
- Waiting in the taxi.

186
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,812
This was the wrong cover. I hate snakes.

187
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,500
Taxi. Please be comfortable.

188
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,331
- I am Sadruddin, Head of Section.
- How do you do?

189
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,372
- I booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel.
- Good. My luggage?

190
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,456
Gone ahead.

191
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,935
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?

192
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,973
Exiled Afghan prince.
Sportsman - polo, cricket, tennis.

193
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,897
- I play a bit myself.
- Really?

194
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,252
As a matter of fact, I've got
a part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.

195
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,690
- What have you learned so far?
- My backhand's improved.

196
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,412
Kamal lives there on the hill.

197
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,010
The Monsoon Palace.
It's heavily guarded.

198
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,009
- How do I get to him?
- He plays backgammon at the hotel.

199
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,779
As a guest,
you're automatically a member.

200
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,576
- Let's meet there later.
- I'll change into something less casual.

201
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,851
Here, you may need this
to play with your asp.

202
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,612
Good morning. Name's Bond.
I believe you have a reservation.

203
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,731
- We've been expecting you.
- Good.

204
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,816
I hope you have a pleasant stay.

205
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,530
I'm sure I will.

206
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,176
Thank you.

207
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,089
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.

208
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,935
- Oh, thank you.
- If I can be of further assistance...

209
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,818
- Anything at all?
- Maybe later.

210
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,009
- How's he doing?
- The Major's no novice.

211
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,930
- But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.
- You'll have a job beating this.

212
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,937
I feel lucky. Shall we double?

213
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,136
Of course.

214
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,820
20,000 rupees.

215
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,131
- Always a double six when you need it.
- Always.

216
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,933
- How do you do it.
- It's all in the wrist.

217
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,211
- It's hopeless.
- Shall we have another game, Major?

218
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,774
- Same stake?
- Yes, I'll have another go.

219
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,858
Your luck's got to run out some time.

220
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,332
May I join you?

221
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,258
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?

222
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,535
- The man at the auction.
- Precisely.

223
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,810
You have a good memory for faces.

224
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,176
And figures.

225
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,697
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No.

226
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,130
- What will you have?
- Nothing, thank you.

227
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,615
Some other time, perhaps?

228
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,936
Thank you.

229
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,132
Six and one.

230
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,728
- Well?
- Looks like the Major has got him.

231
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,056
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?
Double to 100,000 rupees.

232
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,929
I can't accept. Not with your luck.

233
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,852
You win.

234
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,858
I would have taken that double, myself.

235
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,536
Then why don't you take over
the Major's position? Mr...?

236
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,412
Bond.

237
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,532
James Bond. Thank you, I'd be delighted.

238
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,020
100,000 rupees, then.

239
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,532
Double six.

240
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,572
Not such a good double to accept,
after all, was it?

241
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,779
- Double.
- Of course.

242
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,414
You can only win with a double six.

243
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,534
The stake is 200,000 rupees.
Do you have the cash?

244
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,412
Well, I think that this
should be ample security.

245
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,932
Don't you?

246
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,489
Play, Mr Bond.

247
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,490
You'll need a great deal of luck
to get out of this.

248
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,338
Oh, luck?

249
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,169
Well, then I shall use player's privilege,

250
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,337
and use your lucky dice.

251
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,176
It's all in the wrist.

252
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,816
Double sixes.

253
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,256
Fancy that.

254
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,336
200,000 rupees.

255
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,339
I prefer cash.

256
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,016
- Get it cashed for him.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,179
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.

258
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,053
I intend to, Kamal Khan.

259
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,856
My security.

260
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,336
And yours?

261
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,255
It's not really in the wrist, you know.

262
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,655
- Should I be following them?
- Yes, but I think they'll be following this.

263
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,974
Thank you.

264
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,537
Vijay will take you from here.
I'll see if I can find out more about Kamal.

265
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,616
Good. Hold on to these, will you?

266
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,138
Keep you in curry
for a few weeks, won't it?

267
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,730
Thank you.
It's a wonderful racket, this.

268
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,970
- Vijay, we have company.
- No problem. This is a company car.

269
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,175
Step on it.

270
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,294
This should shake 'em off.

271
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,498
Thank God for hard currency.

272
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,608
Game, set and match. Hang on, James.

273
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,535
Keep your head down.

274
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,056
Thank you.

275
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,052
Get off my bed.

276
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,017
Here. Catch.

277
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,216
Excuse me.

278
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,729
Thank you.
You'd better stick this back yourself.

279
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,015
James, over here. Come on.

280
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,659
Vijay. The money I gave you.

281
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,895
Here. Rupees!

282
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,176
Easy come, easy go.

283
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,294
It pays to advertise.

284
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,376
This way, James.

285
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,416
Ah, Q.

286
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,332
- How are you?
- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.

287
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,372
How can I be expected
to maintain the quality of my work?

288
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,173
Sent out here at a moment's notice.

289
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,339
Have you any smaller thread?
Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.

290
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,815
Pity they missed you.

291
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,408
Karen, see to that, will you?

292
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,691
I've also mislaid my PPK.

293
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,539
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

294
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,612
Blast.

295
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,410
Having problems keeping it up, Q?

296
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,496
Experimental model.

297
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,456
- Hello, Smithers.
- Commander.

298
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,937
- Smashing, Q.
- Come on. I have a few things for you.

299
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,891
Very nice, Smithers.

300
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,090
Is the homing device ready yet?

301
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,453
Not only a homing device, but an
extremely delicate microphone as well.

302
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,495
It goes in there like that.

303
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,134
Now, take a fountain pen.

304
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,820
Twist the top,

305
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,013
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid.

306
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,499
- Dissolves all metals.
- Wonderful for poison-pen letters.

307
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,009
Pay attention, 007.

308
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,096
Pull the top off the pen.

309
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,054
With this ultrasensitive earpiece,
you can listen in on the bug.

310
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,369
The homing device is compatible with
the radio directional finder in your watch.

311
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,650
If you haven't lost it.

312
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,455
That's amazing, Q. It does work.

313
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,416
What's that?

314
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,930
That's the latest liquid-crystal TV.

315
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,856
Very handy.

316
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,574
Perfect image, Q.

317
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,497
Really, 007.

318
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,249
Look, I haven't time
for these adolescent antics.

319
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,897
- It's the best we can do.
- It's beautiful. Thank you.

320
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,330
Go on, get along. I've got my work to do.

321
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,496
- I'll give you a hand, Q.
- Thank you.

322
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,338
Don't forget this.

323
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,089
Don't let him teach you
any of his bad habits.

324
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,694
Mr Bond, your table is ready.

325
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,256
- I didn't reserve one.
- Your guest is waiting, sir.

326
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,132
This way, please.

327
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,576
Thank you.

328
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,254
You changed your mind.

329
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,769
- I'm glad.
- Are you?

330
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,130
Well, let's put it this way.

331
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:37,096
So far, you are the least lethal and
by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends.

332
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,972
Thank you.

333
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,536
So does he have
a proposition for me, or do you?

334
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,616
He suggests a trade.

335
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,891
The egg for your life.

336
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,972
I'd heard the price of eggs
was going up, but isn't that a little high?

337
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,175
Charge it to Room...?

338
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,972
Oh, 27.
Along with the champagne, I suppose?

339
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,295
I'll leave it at the desk.

340
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,011
You don't mind?

341
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,655
Why? Has Kamal forgotten
what I look like already?

342
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,930
It's for me.

343
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,090
So that if I depart this world suddenly,

344
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,008
you'll have something
to remember me by?

345
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,290
Something like that.

346
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,540
It's for my scrapbook. I collect memories.

347
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,417
Well, let's get on with making a few.

348
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,933
I need refilling.

349
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,890
Of course you do.

350
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,690
I'll get some more.

351
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,256
Don't bother.
We'll make yours a loving cup.

352
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,730
What a good idea.

353
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,008
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?

354
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,415
That's my little octopussy.

355
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,612
Good morning.

356
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,571
Morning.

357
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,090
I didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,

358
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,178
I can say a proper goodbye.

359
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,896
What is the time?

360
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,656
Beautiful view, isn't it?

361
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,139
- I don't know how to say goodbye.
- Actions speak louder than words.

362
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,613
So right.

363
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,298
In. Out. In. Out.

364
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,414
Come on, girls. In. Out.

365
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,936
Check oars.

366
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,334
The egg has been recovered.

367
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,732
You should be pleased.

368
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,216
I'm not pleased
it was stolen in the first place.

369
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,099
Nor that the thief
knows enough to bring it here.

370
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,452
He's obviously an adventurer
with possible blackmail on his mind.

371
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,334
Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon Palace.

372
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,770
And he will tell us
all he knows very quickly.

373
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,408
- Who is he?
- Englishman.

374
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,089
Likes eggs. Preferably Fabergé.

375
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,859
And dice. Preferably loaded.

376
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,130
His name is James Bond.

377
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,692
Bring him here.

378
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:50,018
He's dangerous. After he's talked,
we must get rid of him immediately.

379
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,492
No.

380
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,216
A "no" from you
has little chance of becoming a "yes".

381
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,218
I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over.

382
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,457
But you're making a serious mistake.

383
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,136
Well, so far I can't complain
about the valet service.

384
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,095
Dinner. 8 o'clock.

385
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,018
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Good evening.

386
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,892
Well rested?

387
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,137
I believe you and Miss Magda have met.

388
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,175
- It was a pleasure.
- You're too kind.

389
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,978
You don't mind if we start?
The soufflé can't wait.

390
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,769
At the risk of appearing
to be making light dinner conversation,

391
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,414
may I ask exactly why I am here?

392
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,418
I mean, after all, you do have the egg.

393
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,812
True. But we don't have all the answers.

394
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,252
Well, supposing, for argument's sake,
I don't feel like talking?

395
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,736
Don't worry, you will.

396
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,135
Let me guess.

397
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,569
Thumbscrews and hot coals.

398
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,056
Hardly. We're much more
sophisticated than that.

399
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:01,530
- Sodium Pentothal?
- A bit crude. Very unreliable.

400
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,609
We prefer curare with
an effective psychedelic compound.

401
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,890
Guaranteed results.

402
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,218
- But with permanent brain damage.
- An unfortunate side effect.

403
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,812
One of our specialities.

404
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,618
Stuffed sheep's head.

405
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:32,773
It's odd, but when I'm stared at
I seem to lose my appetite.

406
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,729
Oh, thank you for dinner.

407
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,856
Until tomorrow, then.

408
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,132
- Well, I'll say good night.
- I could come in for a nightcap.

409
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,694
Some other time, perhaps.

410
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,698
I don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap? No.

411
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,133
I trust you had a pleasant flight.

412
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,779
If you step this way,
I think you will find everything is in order.

413
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,939
Congratulations on the quality of
your workmanship, Kamal Khan.

414
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,298
Thank you, General Orlov.

415
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,493
As you can see, each piece
has been meticulously duplicated

416
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,771
according to Lenkin's specifications.

417
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,771
Good. Have it put aboard the helicopter.

418
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,539
- Can they be trusted?
- I assure you oftheir silence.

419
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,854
We are both playing for enormous stakes.

420
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:58,338
I get what I want,
then you get the genuine jewellery.

421
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,452
Exactly...

422
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,652
The precise timing will be essential.

423
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,735
Remember: Nothing must be changed.

424
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:36,296
One week from today, in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

425
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,700
- Karl-Marx-Stadt.
- Correct.

426
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,214
- Everything taken care of?
- As you ordered, Excellence.

427
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,855
- So, you recovered it?
- From an accomplice ofthe thief.

428
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,017
He must be eliminated at once.

429
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,537
There must be no further security breach.

430
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,811
This fake has caused enough trouble.

431
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,655
I must go.

432
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,139
Everything has been most satisfactory.

433
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,296
Most kind, General Orlov.

434
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,168
Get Bond.

435
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,615
The Englishman has escaped.

436
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:46,574
He won't go very far. We'll track him.

437
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,778
Good.

438
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,175
Let the sport commence.

439
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,612
Head him off.

440
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,618
Sit!

441
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,492
We have him.

442
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,613
Go round. He's in there.

443
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,656
Hiss off.

444
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,254
Don't let him get away.

445
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,495
C'mom, buddy, c'mon.

446
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,890
- Hey, you all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.

447
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,172
- Are you with our group?
- No, ma'am. I'm with the economy tour.

448
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,815
Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.

449
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,408
Soon to be made extinct.

450
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:27,930
Genus Hapalochlaena. Produces a venom
that's invariably fatal in seconds.

451
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,654
The barge had that sign.

452
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,409
It belongs to a wealthy woman
who lives on the floating palace.

453
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,893
Who?

454
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,490
No one knows her real name,
but she's known as Octopussy.

455
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,690
That's the name I heard at Kamal's.

456
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,972
I hear that island's full of
beautiful women. No men allowed.

457
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,058
Really? Sexual discrimination.

458
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,055
I'll definitely have to pay it a visit.

459
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,056
Good evening.

460
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,490
I wondered when you might arrive.

461
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,895
So you are the mysterious Octopussy.

462
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,296
And you are James Bond.

463
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,809
007, licensed to kill.

464
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:35,890
Am I to be your target for tonight?

465
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,256
Not necessarily.

466
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,616
Depends how much you tell me
about jewellery smuggling.

467
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,573
And why one of our agents
was killed in East Berlin.

468
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,656
I know nothing about that.

469
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:52,180
You remember Major Dexter Smythe?

470
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,292
You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?

471
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,888
You seem to have done your homework.

472
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:03,296
Thank you. Yes. Smythe, after a brilliant
military career, joined our secret service.

473
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:08,130
His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.

474
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,979
Both he and his native guide disappeared.

475
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,534
The gold was never found.

476
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:17,180
And 20 years later
you were sent after him.

477
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:24,457
The guide's body turned up with a bullet
still in his skull from Smythe's revolver.

478
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,935
I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,

479
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:31,019
and gave him 24 hours to clear up
his affairs before I took him back.

480
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:35,179
He committed suicide rather than
face the disgrace of a court martial.

481
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,450
What's the connection?

482
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:44,451
He was my father. I'd hoped
fate would bring us together one day.

483
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,616
To avenge him?

484
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,289
To thank you for giving him
an honourable alternative.

485
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,096
Come in.

486
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,169
Kamal Khan to see you.

487
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,736
Bond has escaped.

488
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,818
- How careless of you.
- I apologise.

489
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:13,215
By the way, I'd like you
to meet my new house guest.

490
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:16,696
An old friend of the family, you might say.

491
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,617
How lovely.

492
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:22,335
You have a nasty habit of surviving.

493
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,690
You know what they say about the fittest.

494
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:31,619
Octopussy, I'd enjoy another opportunity
to take care of Mr Bond personally.

495
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,459
I will take care of Mr Bond myself.

496
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,496
Good night.

497
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,448
And enjoy yourselves.

498
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,136
Mr Bond.

499
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:55,177
My father became
a leading authority on octopi.

500
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,656
He loved them.
His pet name for me was Octopussy.

501
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,815
Mr Bond, smuggling is
no concern of the secret service.

502
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,649
I've violated no British law.

503
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,171
You are free to leave, but I'd much prefer
if you stayed as my guest for a few days.

504
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,136
I'd like that.

505
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,570
Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.

506
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,730
Good night, Mr Bond.

507
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,810
Till the morning, then.

508
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,052
Midge.

509
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:39,138
Extend Mr Bond every courtesy,
but double the guard on his quarters.

510
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:03,020
He says the island is heavily guarded.

511
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,372
We don't want to
make enemies with the woman.

512
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:34,138
The woman must not be harmed.

513
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:58,092
When Father's gold ran out, the people in
Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him

514
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,337
offered me a commission
to smuggle some diamonds.

515
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,496
I discovered I had a talent for it.

516
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,611
You went into business for yourself?

517
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:09,938
Yes, but I needed an organisation,
so I revived the old Octopus cult.

518
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,539
Well, then.
Where did you recruit all these lovelies?

519
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,173
There are many of them
all over Southeast Asia,

520
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,690
looking for a guru,
spiritual discipline, who knows what.

521
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:26,894
I train them. Give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of life.

522
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,534
- In crime?
- In business.

523
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,858
I have diversified into
shipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses.

524
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,613
- Is he still there?
- You must be joking.

525
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,449
007 on an island
populated exclusively by women?

526
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,014
We won't see him till dawn.

527
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,579
- I'll relieve you at midnight.
- No problem.

528
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,772
Are we going somewhere?

529
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,698
I have to go to Europe tomorrow
on a business trip.

530
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,972
Oh, that's a pity.
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.

531
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,649
I think you should stay.
I'll only be gone a week.

532
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:29,056
When I come back
we'll discuss the future.

533
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:32,729
Well, I can't guarantee
that I'll be here when you return.

534
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:36,170
Oh, James. We're two of a kind.

535
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:41,495
There are vast rewards for a man
of your talents willing to take risks.

536
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:46,213
- I'm not for hire.
- A man of principle.

537
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,217
With a price on his head.

538
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,298
Naturally, you would do it
for Queen and country.

539
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:56,009
I have no country,
I have no price on my head.

540
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:59,974
I don't have to apologise to you,
a paid assassin, for what I am.

541
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,089
No.

542
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,211
You're right.

543
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,695
We are two of a kind.

544
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,856
James.

545
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,016
Q?

546
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,136
Is something wrong?

547
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,176
Not really.

548
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,256
Just a feeling.

549
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:50,418
Why don't you come back to bed?

550
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,937
Move!

551
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,776
James.

552
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,058
Watch it!

553
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,538
Come on.

554
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,731
Careful.

555
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,052
The gun!

556
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:27,293
What happened to Vijay?

557
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,973
He was alive when I found him.

558
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:37,173
- Did he say anything?
- Only "It was Kamal's men."

559
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,816
No more problems.

560
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,090
- Better signal M to meet me in Berlin.
- Why?

561
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:53,530
Well, I have to go to a circus
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

562
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:06,018
We verified the Octopussy Circus
was in East Berlin when we lost 009.

563
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,775
Karl-Marx-Stadt is further east.

564
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:15,179
Why would General Orlov
participate in a jewellery caper?

565
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:19,054
Well, the jewellery, sir,
I think is, if you'll forgive the analogy,

566
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:22,138
only the tip of the tentacle.

567
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,576
Here's the ID you'll need.

568
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,659
Charles Moreton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds

569
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,977
visiting furniture factories
in East Germany.

570
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,376
- Karl will take you in.
- No problem.

571
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,689
Remember, 007, you're on your own.

572
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:49,130
Thank you, sir. That's a great comfort.

573
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,692
Mischka.

574
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:41,373
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.

575
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:45,293
He just arrived from Leningrad.

576
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,411
The Romanov Star.

577
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,376
The Romanov Star.

578
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:36,092
Stay here with the jewellery while
they switch the car to the main track.

579
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,416
You stay, also.

580
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,532
100 kiloton yield.

581
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:02,529
The effects are indistinguishable
from the American medium-yield bomb.

582
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:09,532
The detonator, now listen carefully.
It is pre-set for a four-hour delay.

583
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:12,618
Set time for the explosion here.

584
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:23,249
To activate, insert and twist
the lever a quarter-turn clockwise.

585
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:28,135
Be at least 20 miles away
when it goes off, hm?

586
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,976
The jewellery should net us
300 million in Zürich.

587
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,012
We still have to cross the border.

588
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,696
I must go.

589
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,776
Au revoir, dear lady.

590
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,176
Good luck.

591
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,216
Bring the canister.

592
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,496
Put it in the car.

593
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,491
Leave that. Let's go.

594
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:50,374
Let's stay. Sit on that box.
Hands on your knees. Come on, move.

595
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:53,574
Why is that bomb on the train?

596
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,219
- Who are you?
- British secret service.

597
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,973
You should be more concerned
about getting out of here alive.

598
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:10,731
I am more concerned about an atomic
bomb exploding on a US Air Force base.

599
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:15,012
You can't be inviting a nuclear war.
What happens when the US retaliates?

600
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,008
Against whom?

601
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,695
My God. Of course.

602
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:26,098
Our early-warning system will rule out
the bomb having come from Russia

603
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,176
or anywhere else.

604
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:32,976
Everyone will assume incorrectly that
it was a US bomb triggered accidentally.

605
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:37,374
That would be
the most plausible explanation.

606
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:40,008
Europe will insist on disarmament,

607
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:43,655
leaving every border undefended
for you to walk across at will.

608
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:46,016
It doesn't matter a damn to you

609
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:49,610
that thousands of innocent people
will die in your accident.

610
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:52,812
Better than letting
a handful of old men in Moscow

611
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:56,899
bargain away our advantage
in disarmament talks.

612
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:01,093
On your feet, General.
You're going to stop that train.

613
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,539
- Too late.
- You can stop it at the border.

614
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,890
Kill him!

615
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:41,175
Kill him!

616
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,133
Get to the station!

617
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,816
Stop that car!

618
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,932
Stop.

619
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,096
Follow that car.

620
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:24,099
Kamal Khan says we are to stay here
until we cross the border.

621
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:35,135
The licence plate is General Orlov's.

622
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:38,449
We have discovered this.

623
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:44,898
- Where is General Orlov now?
- Last reported heading for the border.

624
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:12,100
I must get to that train.

625
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:18,735
Stop!

626
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:34,936
A common thief.

627
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,972
A disgrace to the uniform.

628
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,898
Yes. But tomorrow...

629
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:44,175
I shall be a hero...

630
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:47,497
of the Soviet Union.

631
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:18,575
It is now 11.45.

632
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,930
The performance begins at 3.

633
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:25,372
Allowing for delays,
set the bomb to detonate at 3.45.

634
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:45,771
We must leave the base by 3.15.

635
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,858
I take it none of you will be late.

636
01:38:58,540 --> 01:38:59,768
The jewellery.

637
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,130
- Did you recognise him?
- No.

638
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:04,216
Stay here with her.

639
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,492
On the roof. Trouble.

640
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,573
Mischka.

641
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:53,978
And this...

642
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:56,776
for my brother.

643
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,376
And that's for 009.

644
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:44,018
Gobinda will stay with the jewellery.

645
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:28,618
General, excuse me. I have some travel
arrangements to make. Enjoy the show.

646
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:31,618
- Thank you.
- I'm sure he'll get a big blast out of this.

647
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:34,095
I know he won't be disappointed.

648
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:58,335
- That was Bond.
- Good. Let him keep going.

649
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:00,655
He'll be late and we'll be rid of him too.

650
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,616
Great, isn't it?

651
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:15,376
Fantastic.

652
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:22,536
- Marvellous.
- General...

653
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:25,493
How long would I get
in the brig if I stole your wallet?

654
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:27,656
- About two years.
- That long?

655
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:30,578
Well, in that case, I'd better return it.

656
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,372
Son of a gun.

657
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:45,056
- Where's the Base Commander?
- Let's see your circus pass.

658
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:48,092
Damn it, man, it's urgent.

659
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:50,051
Get out. Hands up!

660
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:03,770
Some nut in a red shirt went through in
a stolen car. Wants the Base Commander.

661
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,371
There he is.

662
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,291
Go after that guy in the red shirt.

663
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:15,456
Behind the trailers.

664
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:38,568
Keep searching, you guys.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

665
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:44,418
Look under the trailer, you guys.

666
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:17,133
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Hey. Is anyone else in there?

667
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:24,132
For the first time in this country,
the death-defying human cannonball.

668
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:30,331
I have the pleasure in presenting to you
Francisco the Fearless.

669
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:39,017
The suspect's wearing a clown suit. Over.

670
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:48,295
That's him.

671
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:54,370
Hold it, buddy. You're coming with us.

672
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:14,138
- General, there's a bomb in that cannon.
- Sure. Where else would a bomb be?

673
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:18,253
- Great clown.
- I'm deadly serious. I'm a British agent.

674
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:21,178
- What?
- For God's sake, tell him who I am.

675
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:25,851
Kamal and Orlov double-crossed you.
I saw them take the jewellery off the train.

676
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,290
Does that convince you?

677
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:33,572
Sir, that bomb is set to explode at 3.45.
That's 90 seconds from now.

678
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:36,214
General, this man's either drunk or crazy.

679
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:45,496
He'll destroy the entire operation.

680
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:06,049
You two, grab that man. Hold him.

681
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,896
Damn it. Let go.

682
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:12,611
Let me go, there's a bomb in there.

683
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:25,576
Let him go.

684
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:28,492
Quiet, everyone.

685
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,658
Now?

686
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:49,259
Thank you. Great job, sir.

687
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:51,416
Where was Kamal going?

688
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:53,735
Back to India.

689
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:02,538
Folks, we've had an emergency,
but everything is all right now.

690
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:04,935
You and your families are safe.

691
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:10,535
Now, please leave the tent
in an orderly manner. Thank you.

692
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:17,250
- The plane is refuelled.
- We'll take off at sunrise.

693
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:20,417
- Are the gold certificates on board?
- Yes, Excellence.

694
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:25,854
We'll take these also.
Dollars, pounds, francs, marks.

695
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:28,255
I can always print my own.

696
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:34,814
- What is that?
- Girls selling themselves.

697
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:38,091
Good. It will keep the men occupied.

698
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:40,211
I don't want them to see me leave.

699
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:50,492
Now.

700
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,056
Give us a hand.

701
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:40,136
Come on.

702
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,860
Let's go. All set?

703
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:16,376
Lift.

704
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,456
That's it. Steady.

705
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:36,335
- Make sure the horses are saddled.
- Yes, Excellence.

706
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:38,928
I'll join you in a few minutes.

707
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:56,456
- Do you really think you can escape me?
- Orlov betrayed us.

708
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,299
I swear I knew nothing about the bomb.

709
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:05,529
We're partners, we're friends. Octopussy,
I would never do anything to hurt you.

710
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:21,619
You left me to be killed
along with thousands of innocent people.

711
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:23,298
Octopussy.

712
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:25,298
Octopussy.

713
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:31,249
Look. I was bringing you this.
We can make millions.

714
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:38,697
Take her. She's our ticket out of here.

715
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:03,888
- I trust you can handle this contraption.
- It goes by hot air.

716
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:05,976
Oh, then you can.

717
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:18,376
- They're doing fine.
- But I don't see Octopussy.

718
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:37,537
- There she is. She's in trouble.
- Get your hands off me.

719
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:40,414
- I'll take her down.
- No. Up!

720
01:55:41,020 --> 01:55:45,536
Where are you going?
Look, don't be an idiot, 007. Come back.

721
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:55,692
Kill him.

722
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:18,536
Come on.

723
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:26,574
What are you doing? Cut it out.
We haven't time for that. Later perhaps.

724
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:52,456
Come on. Giddap.

725
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:08,694
Come on.

726
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:36,056
He'll kill us all. Go out and get him.

727
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:38,136
- Out there?
- Go.

728
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:40,138
Yes, Excellence.

729
02:00:57,460 --> 02:00:58,939
Jump!

730
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:27,854
My government categorically denies
the incident ever occurred.

731
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:33,418
However, we request Bond to return
one of our most historic treasures -

732
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,178
the Romanov Star.

733
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:39,851
In the interests of our Anglo-Soviet
relationships, that can be arranged.

734
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:42,576
Where is Commander Bond?

735
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:47,899
Owing to the serious nature of his
injuries, he's still not fit enough to travel.

736
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:51,888
In. Out. In. Out.

737
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:07,696
- I wish...
- What?

738
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:13,211
I wish you weren't
in such a weakened condition.

739
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:16,492
James!

740
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:02,579
