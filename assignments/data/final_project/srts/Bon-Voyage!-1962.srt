00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,006
and then it's you that winds up
having all the fun.

164
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,843
- next.

165
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,210
- uh, w-where's amy?

166
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,746
she's got the passport,
hasn't she?

167
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,147
- uh, she's over there
talking to that young man.

168
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,083
- where the devil
did she meet that fellow?

169
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,284
- probably in the elevator.

170
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,853
- how could she possibly
meet someone

171
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,821
during a ten-second
elevator ride?

172
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,089
i've been riding in elevators
all my life.

173
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,591
i never met anyone.

174
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,025
- he looks rather nice.

175
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:12,893
- that's probably
what he does--

176
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,862
hangs around elevators
all the time.

177
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,129
they have a name
for his kind--

178
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,598
elevator lurkers.

179
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,732
- oh, don't be silly, harry.

180
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,067
he's one of the passengers.

181
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,602
- katie, sometimes
i don't understand you.

182
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,003
here a fellow
picks up your daughter

183
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,005
right under your nose,
and you're very calm about it.

184
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,140
- well, boys
have to meet girls.

185
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,842
that's the way
the whole thing works.

186
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,578
- well, maybe that's the way
the whole thing works,

187
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,612
but i don't like it.

188
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,013
- oh, you've been
a nervous wreck

189
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,815
ever since amy turned 14.

190
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,084
and i think she takes care
of herself beautifully.

191
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,620
- you call that taking care
of herself beautifully?

192
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,021
we turn our backs
for one split second,

193
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,890
and here's some young spook
massaging her arm,

194
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,158
and amy looking up at him
as if he were--

195
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,595
- shh.
they're coming over.

196
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,299
- mom, dad, i want you
to meet nick o'mara.

197
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,967
he's going over
on the ship with us.

198
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:54,802
- how do you do?

199
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:55,803
- how do you do?
how do you do, sir?

200
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,138
i must apologize
for speaking to your daughter,

201
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,873
but after all,
shipboard informality

202
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,141
is traditional, isn't it?

203
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,010
- uh, a tradition
of the sea, daddy.

204
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,011
- and for all
practical purposes,

205
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,614
we are almost aboard ship now,
don't you agree?

206
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,882
- yes, for all
practical purposes.

207
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,983
- next.

208
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,019
- oh, uh, amy, could i have
the passport, please?

209
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,053
- oh, yes.

210
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,891
- thank you.

211
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,727
- amy.
- oh.

212
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,029
- uh, family passport, huh?

213
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,232
fine.

214
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,233
where are the others?

215
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,836
- oh, the two boys
will be here in a minute.

216
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,740
- sorry, you'll have
to stand aside.

217
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,643
i have to fit the faces
to the passport.

218
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,145
- oh.
- next.

219
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,013
- i know the chief purser
rather well.

220
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,883
if there's anything i can do--
- yeah, would you hold this?

221
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,018
i'll go and see if i can find
the two missing faces.

222
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,822
and, mother, you and amy
stay here, please?

223
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:51,191
- uh, i'll go look
for the purser.

224
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,663
- elliott.
wait a minute.

225
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,033
did you find him?
- no.

226
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,168
- now, look,
the passport desk

227
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,235
is right at the top
of those stairs.

228
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,203
your mother and amy
are up there.

229
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,138
now you go up and join them.
and stay there.

230
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,908
- okay.
- all right.

231
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,855
skipper.

232
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,958
skipper, get off of there.

233
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,393
- hi, pop.
anything wrong?

234
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,695
- no, no.
- i got it right here.

235
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,130
hey!
- wait, wait, hold it!

236
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,032
wait, whoa.
- hey, this is neat.

237
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,434
- well, yeah,
you just hang on, that's--

238
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,969
- we've got to do it
by the rules.

239
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,206
- rules and regulations.
i only see--

240
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,049
- that's four and five.

241
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,919
all faces present
and accounted for, correct?

242
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,867
- okay.

243
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,703
mrs. willard.

244
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,739
- thank you.

245
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,811
- great start, pop.

246
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,123
- whoops.
[laughs]

247
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,325
sorry.

248
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:37,064
[indistinct singing
in the distance]

249
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,768
[indistinct chatter]

250
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,204
- harry, you old rascal.
- well.

251
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,306
- i wondered if my son-in-law
was ever going to show up.

252
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,208
- how are you, mr. bidwell--
uh, horace--

253
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,877
i mean, dad?

254
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,012
- well, how do you
like it, huh?

255
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,179
you didn't think
i was going to let

256
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,314
my little daughter
go off to paris

257
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,049
without a party,
did you?

258
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,052
- no, no, i guess
deep down in my heart, i didn't.

259
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,120
- i just told her mother

260
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,055
i'll gather up some
of katie's old school chums,

261
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,857
a half a dozen or so
of her old suitors,

262
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,059
and we'll let katie know
we haven't forgotten her.

263
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,028
[laughs]

264
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,864
- [chuckles] well, it's--
it's very nice of you, dad--

265
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,133
ho-ho-horace--
i mean, mr. bidwell.

266
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,334
- you know, harry,

267
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,037
i guess none of us
will ever forgive you

268
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,138
for stealing our little girl
and taking her out

269
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,041
to that, uh, terre haute
or whatever it is out there.

270
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,475
- it's, uh, terre haute, sir.

271
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,676
and it really isn't too bad.

272
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,147
we, uh, have the indians pretty
well under control by now.

273
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,282
- [laughs]
- and we have television.

274
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,818
and we get up to chicago
for a weekend now and then,

275
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:08,188
so, uh...
- chicago.

276
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,058
well, why not?

277
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,496
- oh.

278
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,935
[indistinct chatter]

279
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,076
- great girl, that katherine.

280
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,211
- yeah, she's a great girl,
all right.

281
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,612
- have you known her long?

282
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,581
- uh, a few years.

283
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:39,086
- i took katherine
on her very first date.

284
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,954
do you believe it?
- would you believe it?

285
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,157
i've had a few dates
with katherine myself.

286
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:47,327
- katherine was never
a raving beauty, by any means,

287
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,430
but she was handsome.

288
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,367
yes, uh, that's the word
for katherine--handsome.

289
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,606
- i'd say she was beautiful.

290
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,143
- you're not from boston,
are you?

291
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,344
- no, no, i'm not.

292
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,147
- i thought i'd never
seen you around.

293
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,349
- my name's willard.
harry willard.

294
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,953
- you don't say.

295
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,055
- willard?

296
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,324
so you're the one!

297
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,961
- yes, i'm the one.

298
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,631
- well.

299
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:28,168
well.

300
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,070
- mavis, don't tell me
you didn't know.

301
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,439
she married a plumber
or a plumbing contractor

302
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,141
or something like that
out west.

303
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,275
- oh, can you imagine?

304
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,045
a girl like that with her
education and background.

305
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,948
oh, i'd give anything to know
what really happened.

306
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,015
- would you really?

307
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,016
well, i'd just love
to tell you,

308
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,152
because i just happen to know
the whole story.

309
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,454
- you do?
- yes, i do.

310
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,290
actually, it seems that one
summer katherine went

311
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,424
out to this terre haute place

312
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,361
to visit a college friend
of hers, harriet fedling.

313
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,931
and this willard fellow, well,
he's in plumbing, you know.

314
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,566
- yes, we know.

315
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,667
- oh, you know that.

316
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,237
well, anyway he met katherine
at the fedling home,

317
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,240
and, uh, well, he just fell
for her like a ton of bricks.

318
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,642
but she couldn't see him
for dust.

319
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,479
well, one evening
they were going to have

320
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,215
one of those wiener roasts,
you know how they do?

321
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,084
i guess there just isn't
too much to do

322
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,219
around a place
like terre haute.

323
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,321
and he finally managed
to talk katherine

324
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,223
into going with him.

325
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,959
well, of course, katherine
called it a wiener roast,

326
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,295
and he called it
a wienie roast.

327
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,296
[laughs]

328
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,098
[both laugh]

329
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,632
well, they got into
a big argument about that,

330
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,169
and, uh, so to shut her up,
i kissed her,

331
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,737
and she kissed me back,
and we got married.

332
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,173
that's about the whole story
in a nutshell.

333
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,510
cheers.
[laughs]

334
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,412
- [whispering indistinctly]

335
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,581
- whoops!
[laughs]

336
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,219
sorry.

337
00:15:54,787 --> 00:16:00,093
[singing indistinctly]

338
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,628
whoops!
ha ha, sorry.

339
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,496
*

340
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,198
- pop!

341
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,035
i don't know what you're doing,
but it looks very silly.

342
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,237
- well, elliott,
what are you doing

343
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,638
sitting out here
all by yourself?

344
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,773
nothing wrong in there.
- don't worry about me.

345
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,343
go back to your party.
drink.

346
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,344
be happy.

347
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,445
i'll be all right.

348
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,712
- oh, come on, now, elliott.

349
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,780
snap out of it.

350
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,382
this is our trip.
we're supposed to be having fun.

351
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,086
- fun?
oh, that's ironic.

352
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,221
it's truly ironic.
- what's wrong, son?

353
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,656
you can tell me.

354
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,059
- dad, let's not do the
man-to-man-talk bit now, okay?

355
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,126
i-i couldn't take it.

356
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,462
- oh, look, the ship's crawling
with pretty girls.

357
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,098
go and find yourself a girl.
- you don't understand, pop.

358
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,766
you just don't
understand anything.

359
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,502
- i wish you'd stop talking
like i'm from mars or something.

360
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,071
what don't i understand?

361
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:47,107
- simply this--i'm not
interested in other girls.

362
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,077
i'm deeply, beautifully in love
with a very fine person.

363
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,711
together, we might have had
a chance for happiness.

364
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,113
together, we--
- wait a minute.

365
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,381
elliott, are you talking

366
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,383
about that scrawny hamilton kid
back home?

367
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,585
the one with the floppy bangs
that calls me "chum"?

368
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,521
- dad, if we can't discuss ruth

369
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,090
with the respect
to which she is entitled,

370
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,524
i'd rather we didn't
discuss it at all.

371
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,525
- oh, now, elliott.

372
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,128
- may i have a sip
of your champagne, please?

373
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,263
- well.
- thanks.

374
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:11,598
- now, look, elliott.

375
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,066
i don't want to get angry
with you on this trip.

376
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,401
i want to be patient.

377
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,204
- i know you're trying, pop.
- well, thank you.

378
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,438
now, let's put it this way.

379
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,240
if i'd had a chance
to take a trip to europe

380
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,375
when i was your age,
i'd have been overcome with joy.

381
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,245
- is there still time for me
to get off the boat?

382
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,580
- all right, suppose i said,
"go ahead, get off the boat."

383
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:28,848
where would you go?
what would you do?

384
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,583
- i'd hop the first train
back home.

385
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,753
- oh, now.
- do you mean i can?

386
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,123
- elliott,
now you listen to me.

387
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,757
nothing or nobody
is going to spoil this trip

388
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,092
for your mother.

389
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,193
so if you're not
going to cheer up,

390
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,261
you'd better
get off this ship,

391
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,595
and you'd better
get off right now,

392
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,731
because if you pull
this long-face hocus-pocus

393
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,699
after we sail, i'm going
to throw you overboard.

394
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,873
- all visitors ashore, please.
all visitors ashore.

395
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,109
all visitors ashore, please.

396
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,179
[air horn blows]

397
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,619
- yahoo!

398
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,900
yippee!

399
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,337
we're on our way, pop.

400
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,139
yay!

401
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,175
- hang on.
- yahoo!

402
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,807
- liberty--
given by the people of france

403
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,509
in friendship and brotherhood
to the people

404
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,379
of the united states
in the year 1884.

405
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,481
funny, all the things
i've read about that statue,

406
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,949
this is the first time
i've seen her...

407
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,918
in, uh, person, that is.

408
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,286
well, mother, what do you say

409
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,621
we take a little stroll
around the deck?

410
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,657
how about, uh, aft?
- all right.

411
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,958
- oh.

412
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,261
- that's, uh, quite a sight,
isn't it?

413
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,729
- you know, all the times
i've been across,

414
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,397
i still get a charge
out of the old girl.

415
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,733
- i guess you've been
back and forth quite a lot.

416
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:27,700
- it's his 13th crossing.

417
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,404
and already nick says
it's his lucky one.

418
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:34,507
his mother lives in paris.
she's a contessa, imagine.

419
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,543
and he went to school there
part of the time.

420
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,646
his father--his real father,
that is, lives in new york

421
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,948
and is married
to a famous painter.

422
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,417
- you must lead quite
an interesting life, mr. o'hara.

423
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,487
- o'mara, father--
nicholas o'mara.

424
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,689
he's an architect.
- oh.

425
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:50,623
- well, not exactly.

426
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,624
i just finished
my graduate work at yale.

427
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,961
- oh, with honors
and offers from all sides.

428
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,231
and his sketches won some very
important prize in new york.

429
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,566
he's going over
to visit his mother now,

430
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,368
but if europe looks
at all interesting this season,

431
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:05,405
he may do some field studies
over there.

432
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,806
- my, we certainly know
a lot about you,

433
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,608
don't we, mr. o'mara?

434
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,278
- if you don't mind, i'd like
to show amy around the ship.

435
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:15,014
- well, uh...

436
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,949
he did say yale, didn't he?

437
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,487
- harry, some of the sweetest
boys i knew went to yale.

438
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,255
i hope skipper isn't getting
into any trouble.

439
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,658
- oh, forget skipper.
the one i'm worried about is--

440
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,966
- your chin is hanging, harry.

441
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,503
well, there's one girl
who won't call you chum...

442
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,638
chum.

443
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,706
- how do you like that?

444
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,308
and i was feeling
sorry for him.

445
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,776
- [chuckles]
elliott enjoys suffering.

446
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,744
why don't you relax?

447
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,913
- [chuckles]
all right.

448
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,549
as the travel folders say,
when you step aboard

449
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,551
this magnificent
luxury liner,

450
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,553
dull care
will magically vanish.

451
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,288
anxieties disappear.

452
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,658
you will live five, lovely,
lazy, carefree days afloat.

453
00:20:58,691 --> 00:20:59,926
[both chuckle]

454
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,828
i'm sorry you had
to wait so long, katie.

455
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,630
- oh, darling, this is one

456
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:06,999
of the absolutely perfect
moments of my life.

457
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,978
- you know the most wonderful
thing about this trip?

458
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,680
it's going to give me a chance
to get reacquainted

459
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:21,948
with my family.

460
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,082
what with work and all,
i had the feeling

461
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,183
i was neglecting you all.

462
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,086
- nonsense, darling.
you've been a wonderful father.

463
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,955
- i figured out a few things
that might be fun

464
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,056
for all of us
to do this morning.

465
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,625
- oh, i'm afraid you'll have
to count me out, daddy.

466
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,093
i've got a date with nick
at 9:30.

467
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,495
- oh.
- bye, mom.

468
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,896
- bye-bye.

469
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,698
- well, i guess--
- that reminds me.

470
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,668
i better crank up
and find that east indian girl.

471
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,636
i want to get in solid with her
before some sharp operator

472
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,637
gets a hold of her.

473
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,572
- she's very lovely, elliott.

474
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:49,041
- yeah, kind of mysterious
and spiritual.

475
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,577
that stuff
does something to me.

476
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,412
hey, dad,
you may be right

477
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,046
about that ruth hamilton,
after all.

478
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,950
next to this girl,
she does seem kind of clunky.

479
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,452
- as you can see already,

480
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,854
travel is beginning to broaden
elliott's outlook.

481
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,923
- yes.
- [laughs]

482
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,057
- well, mother,
what do we do this morning?

483
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,659
i'm not going to neglect you.
- of course you're not.

484
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,660
i won't let you.

485
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:08,895
i have an appointment
to get my hair washed.

486
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,096
- oh, you know,
wait a minute.

487
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,531
you're all going to run off
and leave me?

488
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,565
what am i supposed to do?

489
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,800
- well, there's always skipper.

490
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,802
you said you wanted time
to know him better.

491
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,438
that's right, father and son
should be better pals.

492
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,372
where is skipper?

493
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,541
- well, he must be someplace
on the ship.

494
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,842
would you like to walk me
to the beauty shop?

495
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,843
- sure, you know where it is?
- no.

496
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,111
- well, i'll show you.

497
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,946
got a layout of the ship
right here.

498
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:33,986
- okay, pop.

499
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,455
- oh, all set, boy?

500
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,989
okay.

501
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:37,890
all right, now,
don't be afraid.

502
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,926
just try to hit me
as hard as you can.

503
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,462
come on.

504
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:46,466
[groans]

505
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,468
- gee, i didn't hurt you,
did i, pop?

506
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,637
- no, don't--don't be
silly, skipper.

507
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,938
how could a little fellow
like you

508
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,941
hurt a big fellow
like me?

509
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,876
[laughter]

510
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,682
there, that's--
that's a very good jab.

511
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,850
good.
good, skipper.

512
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,418
there you go.
catch it.

513
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:06,586
- nice catch.

514
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,821
- all right, get that one.
here.

515
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:09,922
- get this one.

516
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:13,826
- oh, whoa.
[laughs]

517
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,963
[breathing heavily]

518
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,132
oh, oh.

519
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,769
[sighs]

520
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:28,007
[laughs]

521
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,977
- [laughs]
silly.

522
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,945
oh, we're not going
to england.

523
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,448
first paris
and then the riviera.

524
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,049
- wait till you get to paris.
you're going to love it there.

525
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,552
you really are.

526
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,553
hey.

527
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,589
there you are.

528
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:43,690
- thanks.

529
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:44,591
- in cannes,
the beach is beautiful.

530
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:49,095
you have never seen
anything like it.

531
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,532
- what do you think
of that fellow o'mara?

532
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,934
[both laughing]

533
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,135
- search me.

534
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,937
he's no different
from the other creeps

535
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,640
amy goes with back home.
ready?

536
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,110
get this one!
- oh.

537
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,045
[laughs]
a little high!

538
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,155
- come on, let's go!

539
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,834
- oh!

540
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,618
all right, come on.
let it go.

541
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:46,819
- okay.

542
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,020
- atta boy.

543
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,589
oh, oh.

544
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:50,990
i'll get it.

545
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:51,991
[cracking]

546
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,962
ooh!

547
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,830
oh, that's nice.
easy.

548
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,065
oh, just take it easy.
oh.

549
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,601
oh!

550
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,269
it's all right.

551
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,837
thanks, fellows.

552
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,806
it's an old football injury.

553
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,941
i got it in the purdue game.

554
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,943
- skipper, you want to go
for a swim?

555
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,279
they got a pretty good pool
in this tub.

556
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,881
- yeah, skip, why don't you?

557
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:17,216
- no, thanks, fellows.
i got to play with my pop.

558
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,887
- okay.
so long.

559
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,657
- so long, fellows.

560
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,902
- now, you take
this modern generation,

561
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,004
the so-called
youth of america...

562
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,338
- one spade.

563
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,873
- pass.

564
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:44,143
where modern parents go wrong
is they've forgotten

565
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,945
the good
old-fashioned precept,

566
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,881
"spare the rod
and spoil the child."

567
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,282
- judge.

568
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:53,285
- [mumbling]

569
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,721
two clubs.

570
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:59,191
- three hearts,
judge henderson.

571
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,032
- three spades.

572
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,067
- harry.

573
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,615
harry?
- oh, it's my bid, isn't it?

574
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,250
i pass.

575
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,618
- pass.

576
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:28,721
- three no-trump.

577
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,124
- as i was saying,
in all the 32 years

578
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,994
i spent on the bench,
there never was

579
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,129
a wayward boy or girl
brought before me

580
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,999
that i couldn't
track the cause

581
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:44,837
to some miserable, inept,
slack-handed parents.

582
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:48,407
how say you, willard?

583
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,910
- uh, guilty.
[laughs]

584
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,013
i mean, uh, i-i pass.

585
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,915
- how many children
did you say you have, judge?

586
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,051
- i'm sorry to say,
mrs. willard,

587
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:02,755
we have neither
chick nor child.

588
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,756
double.

589
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,958
- re-double.

590
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:09,962
- i think i'll go out
and stretch my legs.

591
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:14,200
i'm a little twingey
from that workout today.

592
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,970
- you know what the trouble
with most people is?

593
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,172
they can't distinguish
between shipboard romance

594
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,874
and the real thing.

595
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,910
now, as for myself...

596
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,983
- mrs. willard.

597
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,085
- oh.
oh, yes.

598
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,463
- 200 for doubled.
you re-doubled.

599
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,931
- re-doubled.
- katie.

600
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,066
- oh, harry,
we won re-doubled.

601
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,400
- fine, now let's turn in.

602
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,401
- well, what's the hurry?
it's so early.

603
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,369
- katie, we're going.

604
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,137
good night, judge henderson,
mrs. henderson.

605
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:28,040
- good night.
- good night.

606
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,276
- forceful devil.

607
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,980
- what's this all about?

608
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:36,448
what in the world's
come over you?

609
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:39,986
- katie, what have you told
amy about things?

610
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,120
- things?

611
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,022
- yes, you know
what i'm talking about--

612
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,891
things.

613
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:45,958
- oh.

614
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,160
well, i've always answered
every question honestly,

615
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,762
or as honestly
as i could.

616
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,998
- but what has she asked you?

617
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:56,068
- oh, she's asked me...

618
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:59,038
- what has she asked you?

619
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,206
- skipper's still awake,

620
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,775
and he's got ears
like a fox, you know.

621
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,878
- katie, will you please
stop stalling?

622
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:08,314
- oh, i know
what you're getting at.

623
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,416
incidentally, have you discussed
things with elliott?

624
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,152
- elliott is another sub--
- shh!

625
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,520
- he's another
subject entirely.

626
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,022
- well, if you ask me
elliott needs

627
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,990
a lot more help
than amy.

628
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,927
did you see him tonight?

629
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,795
- oh.

630
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:24,931
there's just something
about that nick o'mara

631
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,199
that raises my hackles.

632
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,335
he admits he went to yale.

633
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,937
- now, harry.
- i know.

634
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,006
some of the sweetest boys
you knew went to yale.

635
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,342
- amy can take care of herself.
- yeah.

636
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,177
and i thought the only thing
we had to worry about

637
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,148
on this trip was to make sure
everybody drank bottled water.

638
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,150
- well, if you promise
not to mention it again,

639
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,818
i'll tell you something
that amy told me

640
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:47,453
not three months ago.

641
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:48,454
- what did she tell you?

642
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,422
- she said that
she had never met a young man

643
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,059
who stirred her up.
- well, is that bad?

644
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,061
- well, i was beginning
to worry about it.

645
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,262
- to worry?

646
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,030
- you don't think we've been
too strict with her, do you?

647
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,598
- i do not.
- will you stop barking?

648
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,833
- i'm sorry.

649
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,202
- i don't know why you have
to start picking on poor amy.

650
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:07,940
i could understand
your concern about elliott.

651
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:10,442
darling, you're getting
all worked up over nothing.

652
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,044
- over nothing?

653
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,145
- i think you're
a teeny bit tired

654
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,147
from all the things
you've been doing with skipper.

655
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,482
- a teeny bit tired?

656
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,084
a teeny bit tired!

657
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:20,019
katie, i don't know why i should
try to hide it from you.

658
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,154
i have never been
so exhausted in my life.

659
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:23,956
i ache in every bone
in my body,

660
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,225
from the scalp of my head
to the soles of my feet.

661
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,027
- well, why didn't you
say so in the first place?

662
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,597
come on.
- hmm?

663
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,035
oh.

664
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,304
thank you.

665
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,875
oh, that's good.

666
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,044
katie.
- hmm?

667
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,879
- did you ever read
state fair,

668
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,214
you know, the book?

669
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,549
- you just relax.

670
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,085
- it's about a family.

671
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,354
all they did was go
to a state fair.

672
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,958
the kids got all tangled up
in love affairs.

673
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,492
- now don't start
imagining things.

674
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:06,966
- that was just a plain,
ordinary iowa state fair.

675
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:11,603
here we are on our way
to europe.

676
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:14,941
boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

677
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,612
- harry, i love you.

678
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,950
sometimes i think
it's a miracle, you and i.

679
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,217
i honestly do.

680
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:50,509
harry.
- [snores]

681
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:54,646
what's happening?
what?

682
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,220
- hi, mom!
- shh!

683
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,489
- what's the matter with pop?
- nothing, darling.

684
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,091
but it's our last
full day out.

685
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,325
maybe we ought to let
him relax.

686
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,428
- you mean i don't have to play
with him today?

687
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,964
- no.
- yippee!

688
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:13,032
yippee!

689
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,566
let's go!

690
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,502
- oh, i m-must have dozed off.

691
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,736
i've got to go
and play with skipper.

692
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,837
- well, harry,
skipper didn't want me

693
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,307
to tell you this, but you've
worn him out completely

694
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,508
the last few days.

695
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,575
- what?

696
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,577
- well, you seemed to be having
such a good time,

697
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,079
he didn't want
to spoil your fun.

698
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,514
- [chuckles]
that's great.

699
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,050
i didn't stop because
i didn't want to spoil his fun.

700
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,119
- skipper must love you
very much

701
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,720
to let you run him around
like that.

702
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:38,324
- [chuckles]
oh!

703
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,159
well?

704
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,161
- well, i haven't gotten
to that part yet.

705
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:45,531
- ah, you will.

706
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,173
- oh, good morning, sir.

707
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,241
- oh, good morning.

708
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,375
- may i help you?

709
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:57,376
- uh, i'd like something
in the way

710
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,744
of a mystery, i guess.

711
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,246
i'd like to read about
somebody else's troubles

712
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,380
for a change.
- [chuckles]

713
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,581
very good, sir.

714
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,183
we have any number
of stimulating items

715
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,317
in that category.

716
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:09,388
i rather lean toward the
intellectual-type crime, myself.

717
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:10,722
now, if you'll allow me
to suggest--

718
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,125
- well, i'll find something.
thanks very much.

719
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,061
- well, just as you say, sir.

720
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:17,363
oh, and, uh, good hunting.
- thank you.

721
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,634
- oh, good morning, daddy.

722
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,437
- well, hi, sweetheart.

723
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:26,638
what are you doing,
studying?

724
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:30,309
- mm-mm.
- oh.

725
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,744
you're, uh, suddenly interested
in architecture, hmm?

726
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,380
- mm-hmm.

727
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,382
you know, daddy,
you've got a lot in common,

728
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,716
you and nick.

729
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,051
- how do you mean?

730
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:40,719
- well, nick's being
an architect,

731
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,523
and your being, well,
sort of a builder.

732
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,725
- honey,
i'm a plumbing contractor.

733
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,660
- well, you work
with architects.

734
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,797
- well, that's true.

735
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,133
- daddy, sit down.

736
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,470
what do you really think
of nick?

737
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:01,107
- well--
- you like him, don't you?

738
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,642
- well, yes.
- you do?

739
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,178
i wish i could say
the same for nick.

740
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,714
he doesn't like you at all.

741
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:09,648
- well, what do you know?

742
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,618
- oh, oh, not you
specifically, i guess,

743
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,852
only people like you--

744
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,089
sort of dull, respectable people
with families and so forth.

745
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:20,759
- oh, i see.
- he says that--let it ride.

746
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,229
- no, go on,
i'm slightly interested.

747
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:26,865
- well, nick says that either
people are hypocrites,

748
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,867
just pretending to be happy
and all that,

749
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,237
or else, nick says,
they're deluding themselves,

750
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,272
and that's even worse.

751
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:36,508
- well, he's certainly
a sunny character.

752
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:39,478
- you have to know nick
to understand him.

753
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,114
- no, thanks.

754
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,782
- i knew it.

755
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,117
i knew you hated him.

756
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,452
- i didn't say--

757
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,254
- you just don't understand,
that's all.

758
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:49,888
his father just
gives him money

759
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,858
and then pushes him off,
and his mother's even worse--

760
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,394
divorced twice
and married three times.

761
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,231
and yet nick won't say a word
against either of them.

762
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,467
- but he does admit
he's not crazy about me.

763
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,503
- nick's a lonely boy, pop,

764
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,205
even if
you can't understand it,

765
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:09,908
since we've all been so lucky
in our family.

766
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,345
sometimes nick
just breaks my heart.

767
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:14,813
i wish i'd never met him.

768
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,784
and that's true.

769
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:22,254
- did you find
your mystery, sir?

770
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,623
- yes.

771
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,458
it's called "the case
of the puzzled parent

772
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,626
"who can't understand
why his children

773
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:32,264
keep saying
he doesn't understand."

774
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,766
- hmm.

775
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,768
that's an odd-ish title.

776
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:47,313
- hey.

777
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,515
- did you pay enough ransom
to get us off the ship?

778
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:50,949
- well, i tipped
the room steward,

779
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,883
the dining-room steward,
the deck steward,

780
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,519
the gym instructor,
and several others.

781
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,687
if anyone smiled at me,
i-i handed them money.

782
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,423
- [laughs]
but it was worth it.

783
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,391
[speaking french]

784
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,227
not a picture
in a girdle ad,

785
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,694
not a movie
in glorious technicolor,

786
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,532
but the real genuine article.

787
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:09,235
- and who is that
lone, tragic figure?

788
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,737
- elliott isn't happy
this morning.

789
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,472
- sharma's been locked
in her cabin by her father.

790
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,773
he couldn't even
say good-bye to her.

791
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,208
- well, that's not
a bad way to handle

792
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,743
a girl that age, either.

793
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,812
still, in all, i don't think
it would work with amy, do you?

794
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,949
- well, i'd like
to talk to you about amy.

795
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:24,783
- well, i'm listening.

796
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,685
- we promised
we'd tell each other

797
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:27,919
everything
about the children, right?

798
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:29,488
- that's right.

799
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,390
- well, this is
the kind of a thing

800
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,824
a girl really couldn't tell
her father.

801
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,360
it's something that she
would have to discuss

802
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:35,427
with another woman.

803
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,929
- oh.
well, go on.

804
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,431
- well, you promise
not to get all wrought up?

805
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:42,834
- i will not
get all wrought up.

806
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:43,835
- okay.

807
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:44,803
- katie, for heaven's sake,

808
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:47,005
if you have something
to tell me, tell me.

809
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,676
- hey, pop!

810
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,910
the boat's going to dock soon!

811
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,945
- yes, well,
run along for a few minutes,

812
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:54,946
will you, skipper?

813
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,782
your mother and i
are discussing something.

814
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,518
- well, hurry up, huh?
- yes, we will.

815
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,619
well, katie?

816
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,754
- well, skipper's right.
this could wait until later.

817
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,490
- katie, i am not stirring
from this spot

818
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,692
until you tell me
what happened.

819
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,895
- well, amy told me
she discovered

820
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,897
she had a warm-blooded nature
after all.

821
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,965
- well, what's that
supposed to mean?

822
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,834
and what do you mean
"after all"?

823
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,704
- i didn't know this,
but all this time,

824
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,672
when amy was going around
with those boys back home,

825
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:23,575
she--i'm afraid
she had the reputation

826
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,311
of being sort of a cold fish.

827
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,612
- now, look here, katie--

828
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:27,679
- what i'm trying to say is

829
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:29,481
amy found out,
to respond to a boy,

830
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:32,284
she had to have
some genuine feeling for him,

831
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,286
like nick o'mara.

832
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,921
well, i think that's quite
an accomplishment,

833
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,356
finding out something
like that.

834
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,957
- sure, it's quite
an accomplishment

835
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,025
for that punk o'mara.

836
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,827
i'm going to find him and--
- harry.

837
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,629
you don't understand.
- now, don't you start.

838
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:44,896
- but don't you see
it's important

839
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,432
that amy's found out
she's a vital,

840
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,966
warm-blooded young woman?

841
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,435
aren't you glad?

842
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:50,969
- glad?

843
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,704
- but i think the boy
has her a little puzzled.

844
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,039
- well, i'll tell you
one thing.

845
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,709
he doesn't have me puzzled.
- well, now, wait.

846
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,384
- i think i'll have
a little talk with mr. o'mara.

847
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,718
- harry willard,
you listen to me.

848
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:07,953
now, don't you go jumping in

849
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,555
with your
two big galumphing feet

850
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,956
and dramatize the situation.

851
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,057
- what do you mean?

852
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,559
- well, we have to trust amy.

853
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,760
amy wouldn't let
anything happen,

854
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,895
and she didn't think nick wanted
anything to happen either.

855
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,530
- oh, he didn't, huh?

856
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:19,931
- well, that's why
they've been so quiet today--

857
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,568
just walking around
not saying a word.

858
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:23,969
it's kind of sad and touching.

859
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,071
- touching?
- certainly.

860
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,973
amy told me that the boy
is so mixed up,

861
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,975
he doesn't know
what he wants out of life.

862
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,043
he doesn't believe in marriage,
for one thing.

863
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,111
- oh, some surprise.

864
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,846
- oh, i feel
kind of sorry for him.

865
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,682
and so does amy.
- oh.

866
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,517
- maybe that's what the whole
thing amounts to--pity.

867
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,718
- oh, sure.

868
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:40,819
- well, they're saying
good-bye now,

869
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,521
and that'll be
the end of it.

870
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:43,655
- the end of it?

871
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:44,856
- yes, nick's going
on to london.

872
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,991
- to london?

873
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:46,958
well, for pete's sake, katie.

874
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,827
why didn't you say so
in the first place?

875
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,761
what are we worrying about?

876
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,963
amy will snap out of it
once we hit paris.

877
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,065
come on, let's get off this.

878
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:40,979
- oh, what a beautiful city.

879
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,082
- you mean what a beautiful
tomato patch.

880
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:51,823
i have a feeling that my life
is just about to begin.

881
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,124
[whistle blows]

882
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:56,862
[tires screech]

883
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,830
- golly...

884
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,065
you missed him.

885
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,667
- don't worry
about the traffic, darling.

886
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,934
just pretend
you're on the roller coaster

887
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:03,869
back home
at indian lake.

888
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,936
have fun.

889
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,007
- okay, i'm having fun.

890
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,477
driver, you've got a beautiful
city here, all right.

891
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,078
- mm-hmm.

892
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,581
- it's just an idea, but maybe
if you slowed down a little,

893
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:16,715
we could see it better.

894
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,651
- [speaking french]

895
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,987
- what's the french word
for "slow down"?

896
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,854
- harry, look at it now.

897
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,090
isn't it magnificent?

898
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,869
[horn honks, tires screech]

899
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,070
- i got to hand it to you.

900
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,007
you sure handle
this little, uh, thing.

901
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,543
[horn honks]
look out!

902
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,945
[tires screeching]

903
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,881
look, let's take it
a little easy, could we?

904
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,883
- [speaking french]

905
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,986
- oui, oui, oui, oui.
what did he say?

906
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,222
- he's saying something
about don't point,

907
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,056
it makes him nervous.

908
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:01,126
- oh, it makes him nervous?

909
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,863
hey, there's some people.

910
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,598
look out!
[horn honking]

911
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,767
[tires screech]

912
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,679
[tires screech]

913
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,014
- voila, monsieur.

914
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,931
- [speaking french]

915
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,867
- oui, madame.

916
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,201
- thanks, pop.

917
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,070
- amy, you should look
after your luggage, dear.

918
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,004
- i don't know why
you kids couldn't wait

919
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,873
for your allowance
until we've at least had

920
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:49,140
a look around here.

921
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,609
there you are, skipper.

922
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,010
- what's this?

923
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:52,978
- well, that's ten francs.

924
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,013
that's, uh, two dollars
in our money, okay?

925
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,082
- oh, thanks, pop.
- next.

926
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,017
- what a sweet
old-fashioned hotel.

927
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,151
don't you love it?

928
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,887
well, as soon
as we get settled

929
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,622
and i get a good hot bath,
i'm going to love everything.

930
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:06,758
- it smells like someone's been
shoeing a horse in here.

931
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,697
- that's age, darling.

932
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,699
it's what the artists
call patina--

933
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,967
old wood, old drapes,
old carpets,

934
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,003
and wonderful old
romantic ghosts.

935
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,605
- i think it's great,

936
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:20,538
which incidentally,
it should be,

937
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,841
because the rates are murder.
- [laughs]

938
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,876
[water whooshing loudly]
- hey!

939
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:27,478
- what's the matter?

940
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,080
- that thing in there--
it got me!

941
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:30,181
- what thing?

942
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,350
- how come there are two johns
in the john, anyway?

943
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,985
- what?

944
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,887
- there's two--
- never mind, skipper.

945
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,856
your father will explain it
to you some other time.

946
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,758
now go get your shirt changed.
- explain what?

947
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,226
- if they built those things
for fellows,

948
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,994
somebody sure don't know
what they're doing.

949
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,029
- mom!

950
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,631
you've got to see
my bedroom.

951
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:48,166
it's just fabulous.
- hey!

952
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,002
oh.

953
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,904
there you are.
- merci.

954
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:54,139
merci beaucoup, monsieur
- thank you.

955
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:57,108
- oh, no.

956
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:59,778
- well, sunshine,
what's the matter with you now?

957
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,112
- it's this hotel.

958
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:03,148
- now, elliott, i don't want
to hear any more about--

959
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,817
- pop, you've made
a terrible mistake.

960
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:07,018
you know, we're over here
on the right bank.

961
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:07,886
- the right bank?

962
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,988
- we ought to be over
on the left bank

963
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11,022
where all
the interesting people are.

964
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,257
that's where the action is.

965
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,960
- right bank or left bank--what
difference does it make, el?

966
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,295
- oh, don't you
understand, dad?

967
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,030
well, you've got us here
with a bunch of tourists.

968
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:20,632
next thing you know,

969
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,634
you're going to be dragging us
off to the eiffel tower

970
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:25,170
or some cornflake routine
like that.

971
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,905
[sighs]

972
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:27,873
- look, son...

973
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:31,409
let's get something
straight around here.

974
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,111
we are tourists.

975
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:35,013
we're not playboys
or business tycoons

976
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:37,783
or international spies
or anything like that.

977
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:40,051
we're just plain tourists
from terre haute, indiana.

978
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,119
- pop.

979
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,053
- now, for a start,
it might help

980
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:42,988
if we stop showboating
all over the place

981
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:45,023
and pretending we're
something we're not.

982
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,892
then maybe "tourist" won't be
such a dirty word anymore.

983
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:49,728
- what got you so wound--
- elliott, i--

984
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:51,763
- let's tell your father
and elliott about it.

985
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,164
- harry, get your coat
back on.

986
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,433
i've got a sensational idea.

987
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,735
is there anything wrong?

988
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,904
- no, no, elliott and i
were just saying

989
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:02,407
how much we like the hotel,
weren't we, elliott?

990
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,911
- oh, gosh, mom,
how--how great can a place be?

991
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,713
- forget about unpacking.
forget about everything.

992
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,380
the whole family is going
to the eiffel tower,

993
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:11,016
where we get our first
real look at paris.

994
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,384
how does that sound?
- great.

995
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:15,854
doesn't it
sound great, elliott?

996
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:18,189
it ought to be a blast.

997
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:38,443
- what a perfectly beautiful,
exciting city.

998
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:41,046
- it sure ain't indianapolis.

999
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,115
- oh, it just gives me
duck bumps.

1000
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,718
look, the palace where the kings
and queens of france

1001
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:48,186
used to live

1002
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:53,158
and the hotel on ville de--
the tomb of napoleon.

1003
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,459
it's too bad you're not
old enough to appreciate

1004
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:55,393
all of this.

1005
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,930
- are you kidding?
i know who napoleon is.

1006
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:01,032
he's the guy who had the same
trouble with the english

1007
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:03,001
that custer did
with the indians.

1008
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,503
- how high
do you suppose we are?

1009
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,272
- think we could promote pop
for something to eat?

1010
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,274
i'm starving.

1011
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,180
- tell the folks i'll meet them
back at the hotel.

1012
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:19,050
- hey, where you going?

1013
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:21,286
- well, mother,
we finally made it--

1014
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,054
paris.

1015
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:26,057
we're only about 20 years
behind schedule, that's all.

1016
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:28,526
- 20 years?
where did it go so fast?

1017
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,295
- i don't know.
it's hard to tell.

1018
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,530
there's that first
numbing sensation

1019
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,032
when you get married,
and when you come out of that,

1020
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,333
you notice
some familiar-looking kids

1021
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:39,337
asking you
for the keys to the car.

1022
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,140
- have i changed much
in 20 years?

1023
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:46,011
- yeah, you're about
twice as beautiful now.

1024
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,046
- turn your shoulder
a little more to the right.

1025
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,147
- elliott!

1026
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,916
- okay, now move your right
shoulder a little more.

1027
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,017
now lift your chin up.

1028
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,318
yeah, that's perfect.

1029
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,986
now hold it just like that.
don't move an inch.

1030
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,021
- elliott!

1031
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:58,123
elliott!
get down from there!

1032
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:01,526
- right, dad.
soon as i finish this shot.

1033
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:04,062
- well, what are you doing
up there, anyway?

1034
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,296
- i've got
a great angle, dad.

1035
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,899
- would you get down
from there?

1036
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:09,334
- will you for heaven's sake
be careful?

1037
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:10,568
you can break your legs.

1038
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,437
- don't worry, mom.
nothing to worry about.

1039
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,140
- well, just don't drop
the camera, that's all.

1040
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,875
do you want to end up
in the french clink?

1041
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:20,045
- dad's a good sort,
but he doesn't approve

1042
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,013
of the hazards i face
in my camera work.

1043
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:24,049
- now, look, elliott.
- dad, mom...

1044
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,051
i'd like to present
miss penelope--

1045
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:28,153
- walthorne.
- walthorne.

1046
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:30,055
from brighton, england,
and she'll be gracing

1047
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:31,156
this fair city
for the next few days.

1048
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,058
- how do you do?

1049
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,993
- how do you do?
- pleased to meet you.

1050
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:38,529
i consider myself ever so lucky
to meet your son.

1051
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:40,932
- you do?

1052
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,267
- well, i'm here
on a culture tour,

1053
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,203
and i want to learn
everything i can.

1054
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,938
- well, actually,
we're all learning.

1055
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:51,276
- and elliott--i mean,
mr. willard knows paris so well.

1056
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,344
he's offered to show me
some nice out-of-the-way places

1057
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,080
the tourists don't know about.

1058
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:56,214
- elliott knows paris?

1059
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:59,284
- well, i suppose no one
ever really knows paris, dad,

1060
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,485
not in the complete sense.

1061
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,053
- no, i don't suppose
they ever do.

1062
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,289
son, i'd like to talk to you.
- harry.

1063
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,424
i really think
we should leave.

1064
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:08,426
we have to unpack
before dinner.

1065
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,095
- oh.

1066
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:11,930
well, maybe elliott
can use his influence

1067
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:14,032
to get us into one
of those charming little bistros

1068
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,934
over on the left bank
where they don't allow tourists.

1069
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,535
do you think you might be able
to arrange that, elliott?

1070
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,237
- hey, pop, come here.

1071
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,146
have a look.
- where, skipper?

1072
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:32,583
- right there.

1073
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:37,088
- hey, that's amy.
what's she doing down there?

1074
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:39,357
no.

1075
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,194
not that, not him.

1076
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:46,364
katie!

1077
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,968
- the silliest thing
i ever heard of--

1078
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,502
canceling his trip
to london

1079
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,004
and then hiding
on the boat train

1080
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,606
all the way to paris,
spying on me!

1081
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,142
now, what did he think
i was going to do--

1082
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:00,078
take up with another boy
right off the bat?

1083
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,446
oh, he makes me furious.

1084
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,081
- well, now that you
speak of it,

1085
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:05,083
he does have an irritating
way about him.

1086
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,552
if you ask me--
- the great nick o'mara...

1087
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,354
who does he think he is?
- shh.

1088
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,356
- well, who does
he think he is?

1089
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,091
if he can't start
at the top--

1090
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,359
that's what he wants
to do, you know--

1091
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,194
start right at the top.

1092
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,963
i told him why didn't he do
like other boys

1093
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,464
who'd just graduated
from college

1094
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,166
and get a job
in an architect's office

1095
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,102
and learn
the practical side too.

1096
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,236
you can't be an architect

1097
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,172
just because
you can draw and design.

1098
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:28,473
there's more to it than that,
isn't that so?

1099
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:29,474
- oh, of course.

1100
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,609
uh, would you give me
the sugar, amy, please?

1101
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,677
now, when i first got
interested in plumbing--

1102
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,346
- do you know what he had
the nerve to say to me?

1103
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,083
he said, did i expect him
to get a job

1104
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,450
so that he would
have to settle down

1105
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:42,020
and become an anonymous
eight-hour-a-day vegetable

1106
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:43,955
like everybody else?

1107
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,356
but i told him....

1108
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,159
i said that i didn't give a hoot
if he ever got a job.

1109
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:50,695
that all that i knew
was if he sat around waiting

1110
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:51,762
for people to come
to ask him

1111
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:56,067
to build them a house
or an office or a doghouse

1112
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:57,702
or something
that he'd wait all his life.

1113
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,637
- of course, that's the way
it is in any business.

1114
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,471
now, you take plumbing--

1115
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,473
- i said, as far
as i was concerned,

1116
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:04,175
he might as well
just stop making

1117
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:05,310
all those handsome drawings
of his

1118
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,578
and live off of his rich mother
for the rest of his life

1119
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,247
and forget about being
anything else,

1120
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,117
because he was just
too weak, weak, weak.

1121
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,319
and i told him on the boat too
that i didn't want to see him

1122
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,121
in paris
or anywhere else.

1123
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:19,624
and here he is,
15 minutes late.

1124
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,726
- amy, where a girl,

1125
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,728
or a grown woman
for that matter,

1126
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:26,231
makes a mistake in a thing
like this is when she--

1127
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:27,565
- oh, pop, i hate myself

1128
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:30,101
for saying all those
terrible things about nick.

1129
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:32,737
he's really not
like that at all.

1130
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,107
he's really--well, he's
very gentle and considerate.

1131
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:38,309
and i don't mean
polite-considerate either.

1132
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,511
i mean, honestly considerate.

1133
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:42,080
and he's so alone.

1134
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,348
- well, that's all
fine and good,

1135
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:47,052
but just because he's alone--
- oh, no, it's not that, pop.

1136
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:48,219
it's not pity.

1137
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:51,456
i've thought about that.

1138
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,660
i guess i'm just
too selfish for that.

1139
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:56,761
it's what he does to me.

1140
00:49:56,794 --> 00:50:00,065
- oh, you mean, uh...

1141
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,167
he--he stirs you up.

1142
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,569
uh, your mother told me
about that.

1143
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,205
- did she?

1144
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:12,510
i told her not to,
but i guess i knew she would.

1145
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:15,446
you two talk about everything,
don't you?

1146
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,615
i mean, everything.

1147
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:18,649
that's marvelous.

1148
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:22,187
that's the way
it should be.

1149
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,223
but nick could never understand
anything like that,

1150
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:27,225
that poor-rich-trash way
he's been brought up.

1151
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:30,061
- well, i'm sorry about that,
but there's no need--

1152
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:32,130
- what kind of girls do you
think he's known, anyway?

1153
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:34,799
that's what makes
me so furious.

1154
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:39,704
he can't believe
in anything or anybody.

1155
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:42,373
- amy, this is just a thought,

1156
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:45,376
but what about
the fellows back home?

1157
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,778
you know, bob whelan
and tim bradley.

1158
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:49,847
they're--they're nice kids.
you like them.

1159
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,849
maybe they're--
they're no world shakers,

1160
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,852
but they're nice kids.
- oh, pop, don't ruin it.

1161
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,156
don't 100% prove
that you don't understand.

1162
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:04,195
- i, uh--
i'm sorry.

1163
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,264
- i'm sorry too.

1164
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,598
i guess it's just something

1165
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:09,400
that i'm going to have
to fight through

1166
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:12,270
by myself and get over,

1167
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,605
because that's just
what i intend to do, pop--

1168
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:15,673
get over it.

1169
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,408
- good.

1170
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,277
i'll tell you what,
why don't we start this morning?

1171
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,279
we'll all go to the louvre,
the whole family--

1172
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,313
- oh, i can't do that, pop.

1173
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:24,115
nick has made
some reservations

1174
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,250
at a wonderful
little restaurant

1175
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:27,618
out near versailles.

1176
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:28,886
- oh.

1177
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,122
- but i'm not falling
in love with him, pop,

1178
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:33,758
if that's what
you're thinking.

1179
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,194
i couldn't fall in love
with a mixed-up type like that.

1180
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:39,397
i'd--i'd be ashamed
of myself for life.

1181
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,333
[phone rings]

1182
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:45,536
- [speaking french]

1183
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,206
mademoiselle willard.

1184
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,243
- i'll--i'll get it, amy.

1185
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:53,744
- [speaking french]

1186
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,680
- yes?

1187
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,682
yes, nick.

1188
00:51:57,715 --> 00:52:01,686
oh, you're out
in the lobby.

1189
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:04,522
no, uh, don't come in here.

1190
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,158
she'll be right out.

1191
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:12,197
- oh, why'd you do that, pop?

1192
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,898
- well, amy, all your life,
your mother and i

1193
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:17,468
have been working to make you
into the kind of a girl you are.

1194
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:18,936
i guess maybe now's the time
to leave you alone

1195
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,206
on the battlefield
and see how it turns out.

1196
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,873
- thank you
for the vote of confidence.

1197
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:23,908
i'm going to need all i can get

1198
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:27,545
with the session coming up
with this character.

1199
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:29,314
oh!

1200
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,786
- harry, i'm so excited.
lindsey wells just phoned.

1201
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,954
she's living in paris now.
- well.

1202
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,789
- and she's just wired
two invitations

1203
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:39,924
for the showing
of the new york collection.

1204
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:41,692
- oh, wonderful.
come on, have breakfast.

1205
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:42,927
- no, darling, i have to rush.
- you mean you're going today?

1206
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,429
- yes, so you sit down
and have your breakfast.

1207
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,596
- what about our plans
to go to the louvre?

1208
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,797
- but you don't understand.

1209
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,266
it's very difficult to get
an invitation to that showing.

1210
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:49,467
- well, yeah--

1211
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,601
- it's like getting
into buckingham palace.

1212
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:51,736
- i suppose it is, but--

1213
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:52,937
- i'll see you
at dinnertime, huh?

1214
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,240
- bye-bye, elliott.
- bye-bye, mom.

1215
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:56,241
- skipper, be a good boy.

1216
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:59,410
- bye, mom.

1217
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:00,945
- uh, elliott.

1218
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,880
- gee, dad, i'd like to,
but i'm taking

1219
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,815
this little english number
over to the student quarter

1220
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:08,286
around saint-germain-des-pres
in the left bank.

1221
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,288
- oh, uh, over where
the action is.

1222
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,689
- yeah, we're just going
to klutz around

1223
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:12,990
for a little while.

1224
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,494
then we're going to have lunch
at the cafe de deux magot.

1225
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,828
- "do mago"?

1226
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,830
- yeah, in english,
that means cafe--

1227
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,400
- don't tell me.
i can guess.

1228
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:23,834
aren't you going to have
breakfast?

1229
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,503
- oh, i've had it.
are you kidding?

1230
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,938
i was up at dawn.
dad, i saw the sunrise.

1231
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:29,874
and i saw the boats
coming down the river

1232
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:33,411
and the men
watering down the streets.

1233
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:34,945
oh, dad, if you could
just get off

1234
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,948
this tourist beat of yours
and get to know the real paris--

1235
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,685
- good-bye, elliott.

1236
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:44,255
- okay, dad.
i'm sorry for you.

1237
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,661
- say, uh, skipper,
what are your plans for today?

1238
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:53,764
- well, i'm with you, pop.
anything you say.

1239
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:55,533
- good.
i'll tell you.

1240
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,967
why don't we go to the louvre?

1241
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:59,637
- you're the boss, pop.

1242
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,607
they got anything
fit to eat in this town?

1243
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,278
- well, there it is, skipper--
the louvre.

1244
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:11,916
the most famous collection
of art treasures in the world.

1245
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:14,285
you know, skipper,
most people think the louvre

1246
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,620
is just for grown-ups.

1247
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:17,822
but you know that painting
of custer's last stand

1248
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,657
you're so crazy about?
[laughs]

1249
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,825
wait till you get a load
of some of the battle scenes

1250
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,293
they've got in there.

1251
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:23,794
- of course,
the way you talk about it,

1252
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:25,763
i'm just dying
to see the louvre.

1253
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:26,731
- so?

1254
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,834
- so i'm just afraid
you'll miss the sewers.

1255
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,036
- sewers?

1256
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,838
- sure, they're famous too,
you know?

1257
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,573
- well, of course
they are skipper, but--

1258
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,974
- remember that movie
we saw on tv

1259
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,709
about the fellow
with the beard,

1260
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:41,312
and the police were chasing him
through the sewers of paris

1261
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:42,680
and all that?

1262
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,782
that was terrific, wasn't it?
- well, sure, but--

1263
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,951
well, you just couldn't go down
there and wander around, son.

1264
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:48,586
the police wouldn't let you.

1265
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:49,720
- sure they will.

1266
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,789
the fellow in the hotel--
he even said

1267
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:53,624
that they have a tour
that goes down there,

1268
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,025
only once a week, though.

1269
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,795
you see?

1270
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,797
and they're leaving
in ten minutes!

1271
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,699
come on, pop.
- oh, but now, skipper, we--

1272
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:03,968
- i'll even treat you.

1273
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,986
- as you see,
they've located only

1274
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,054
the famous paris
system of sewers.

1275
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:26,457
there are also such
useful public needs

1276
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:30,861
as water mains, telephone lines,
and electric cables.

1277
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:32,930
- this is really
interesting, skipper.

1278
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,566
i'm glad you brought me
down here.

1279
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,002
[loud hissing]

1280
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:44,709
- this pipe is
a pneumatic system

1281
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:47,445
which delivers
certain items of mail

1282
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:52,349
from the central post office
to various parts of the city.

1283
00:55:57,488 --> 00:56:02,460
hey, monsieur,
watch your head.

1284
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,638
- they did pretty nice work
in those days.

1285
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:16,407
- pop.
- hmm?

1286
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:18,709
- i have to go
to the bathroom.

1287
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:19,977
- what--what was wrong
with the hotel?

1288
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,413
- i didn't have to then!

1289
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:25,049
- oh, well, i'm afraid you'll
just have to wait, skipper.

1290
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:28,686
- you don't think
they'd mind down here, do you?

1291
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,455
- i'll tell you.
we'll ask the guy.

1292
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:32,122
now, come on,
they're getting ahead of us.

1293
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:34,158
come on.

1294
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:47,738
- as you see demonstration,
certain areas

1295
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:53,043
are marked with signs
exactly as the streets above.

1296
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:01,852
this is necessary,
because even sewer workers

1297
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:05,556
with many years experience
become easily lost

1298
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,225
in the vast
labyrinth of tunnels

1299
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,627
beneath the surface.

1300
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,735
- come on, skipper,
maybe we can ask--

1301
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,604
skipper?
- let's go.

1302
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:21,939
- skipper?

1303
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:25,075
skipper!

1304
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,811
skipper.

1305
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:28,112
skipper?

1306
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,080
- monsieur, i must ask you
to stay with the rest of--

1307
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,016
- my boy's back here someplace.
he might be lost.

1308
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:34,852
skipper?
- look, skipper.

1309
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,621
skipper!
- skipper!

1310
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:38,122
- monsieur, no, just a moment.

1311
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,724
skipper!

1312
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:43,594
[all shouting]

1313
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,830
oh, no, no, no, no.
go back, go back.

1314
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:51,001
- skipper?

1315
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:54,639
skipper.

1316
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:59,276
- oh, there you are, boy.

1317
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,079
do not remove yourself
again, huh?

1318
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:05,616
no, no, no, no.
you stay right here with us.

1319
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,884
[laughs]
come on.

1320
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:11,021
monsieur, your son
is safe with us.

1321
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:15,092
let's go.
[speaking french]

admittedly has pretty much

1352
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:58,048
fouled the world up,
and it's, uh...

it's up to, uh...
it's up to us to, uh...

see that?

01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:10,027
look at that.

pardon, monsieur,
i know this is probably

none of my business,

that?

just thought
i'd mention it.

there's probably some poor soul

- never mind, just never mind.

it's been over an hour
since you phoned.

air might do me some good.

- i'm sorry, but that guide
had me right by the hand,

and we all thought
you were right behind us.

01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:44,368
- well, her eyes were red
from crying this morning,

1415
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:46,236
so i decided to ask her why.

1416
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,771
she and nick had
an argument yesterday.

1417
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,706
- oh?
what about?

1418
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,642
- well, nick said that
he didn't believe in marriage

1419
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,744
or anything idiotic like that,

1420
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:58,382
and if she wanted to have fun
or a friendly arrangement

1421
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,717
or whatever they call it these
days, that was fine with him.

1422
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,752
- that's big of him.

1423
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:04,121
- well, she sizzled
and told him off.

1424
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:05,789
i thought that
would be the end of it.

1425
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,625
- evidently it wasn't.

1426
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,731
- harry, i don't like
what's happening.

1427
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,800
i think we should ask her
not to see him anymore.

1428
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,802
- no, i don't think so, katie.

1429
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:21,205
- you don't think so?
well, that's a change.

1430
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:23,073
- well, if amy's anything
like you are,

1431
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:25,509
which she is, she's not going
to like our butting in.

1432
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,776
remember what happened
when your father told you

1433
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,212
to come back from indiana
or else?

1434
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:29,179
- oh, that was different.

1435
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:31,348
- no, no, no, the point is,
amy's got a lot

1436
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,517
of good common sense, right?
- well, certainly.

1437
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,219
but when a girl's emotions
are involved,

1438
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:37,254
she's out of touch with little
things like common sense.

1439
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:40,324
- now, listen, this
nick o'mara's a spoiled brat.

1440
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:41,791
he's arrogant,
and he's selfish.

1441
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:42,792
and the more
we throw them together,

1442
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:45,529
the sooner amy's
going to find that out, right?

1443
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,730
- oh, i don't--

1444
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:47,731
- why should we make
this clown look good

1445
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:48,865
by trying to keep them apart?

1446
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,768
believe me, if we just
don't make a martyr out of him,

1447
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,504
he'll fall flat
on his face.

1448
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,240
- harry, you surprise me.

1449
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:59,243
you're more devious
than i gave you credit for.

1450
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:02,112
- well, i, uh, have given
the matter some thought.

1451
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:04,881
- all right,
you hoosier machiavelli.

1452
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:05,949
where's your first move?

1453
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:09,085
- well, as we say here
in paris, "regarde."

1454
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:21,898
- they call notre dame
the heart of france.

1455
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,668
every road in france has
its geographical starting point

1456
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:27,137
from a spot
in front of the cathedral.

1457
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,539
construction was begun
in 1163.

1458
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:32,742
that's over 300 years
before america was discovered.

1459
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:36,146
yet, for my money,
the flying buttresses

1460
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,882
and, uh, other architectural
features in there are as modern

1461
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:40,650
as most of the stuff
that they're building today.

1462
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:41,885
- 1163, huh?

1463
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:44,921
- well, it's very kind of you
to show us around this way.

1464
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,392
- i, uh, hope this isn't
too boring for you.

1465
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,727
i mean, uh, being out
on a family outing like this.

1466
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,662
- oh, no, no,
not at all.

1467
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:54,764
i'm enjoying it very much,
mr. willard.

1468
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,268
it's very kind of you
to invite me along.

1469
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:07,544
in contrast to notre dame,
which is gothic,

1470
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,813
sacre coeur there
is byzantine.

1471
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:10,947
it dominates
the hill of montmartre,

1472
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,817
which not too long ago was just
a little country village

1473
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,785
overlooking the city of paris.

1474
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,221
- did you know that, daddy?

1475
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:19,256
- well, to tell you
to truth, i didn't.

1476
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:24,828
- oh, daddy, i'm having
such a good time today.

1477
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:25,962
thank you.

1478
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,531
don't you think
nick's wonderful?

1479
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,300
you can see that now,
can't you?

1480
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:48,585
- hey, pop.
look what's coming.

1481
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,971
- amy.

1482
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:47,944
- what is your daughter,
crazy or something?

1483
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,480
- it's possible.

1484
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:52,949
- she's got me so boiled up,
i don't know which end's up.

1485
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,918
you wouldn't like to explain
her to me, would you?

1486
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:55,885
- i'm not sure i could.

1487
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,921
if i could explain amy
or any other member

1488
01:10:57,954 --> 01:10:59,656
of my family,
all the fun would be gone.

1489
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:01,425
- i get the feeling
if i bribed her

1490
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,492
with an engagement ring,
she'd feel different.

1491
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:04,694
- well, i can tell you this.

1492
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:05,929
you're wrong there.

1493
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:08,365
- she puts a price on herself
and a pretty high price too.

1494
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:10,834
- now, listen, young fellow,
you keep talking like that,

1495
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:13,670
and i'm going to kick your can
all the way around the block.

1496
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,805
amy isn't for sale,
at any price.

1497
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,674
but if you think she is,
you get that engagement ring

1498
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:18,842
and try it
and see where you end up.

1499
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,944
- i might just do that.
- you go ahead.

1500
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:23,046
i'd just like
to be around.

1501
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:25,715
- you will be.
you always are.

1502
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:27,917
- now, you listen to me.
- you listen to me, mr. willard.

1503
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,553
i'm just trying to be honest.

1504
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:31,421
now, i'm not interested
in marrying anybody.

1505
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,089
i told amy that.

1506
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,959
because i don't happen to
believe in marriage, that's why.

1507
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:38,094
it starts out fine,
but it's a fake.

1508
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,829
after a while,
the people stop loving.

1509
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:42,031
they just go on making believe,
or they find somebody else,

1510
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:44,434
and they get a divorce,
and the whole idiotic thing

1511
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:45,969
starts all over again.

1512
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,537
either way, it's a trap.

1513
01:11:47,571 --> 01:11:49,038
- son, you don't know
what you're talking about.

1514
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:50,006
- [chuckles sarcastically]

1515
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,841
i just happen to look
a little more deeply

1516
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:53,677
than most people,
that's all.

1517
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,112
i don't let anybody tell me
what to believe or think either.

1518
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,847
i make up my own mind.

1519
01:11:57,881 --> 01:12:00,450
and if your daughter thinks
she's going to change it--

1520
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:01,718
- who said she wants
to change it?

1521
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:02,919
- well, she thinks
she's going to change it

1522
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,053
by playing hard to get,
and then getting me

1523
01:12:04,087 --> 01:12:05,455
all boiled up,
and if you think

1524
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:06,690
you're going to argue me
into believing--

1525
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:07,657
- i'm not trying
to argue you into anything.

1526
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:08,992
- well, if you think
you're going to argue me

1527
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,927
into anything,
you're as wrong as amy.

1528
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,129
if you came abroad to get
a husband for your daughter--

1529
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,698
- well, that last thing i want
for my daughter--

1530
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,434
- if that's what you
came abroad for, count me out.

1531
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,636
i know you don't like me.
- that's for sure.

1532
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,037
- but that means
less than nothing to me.

1533
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,839
let me tell you,
i don't play up to anybody.

1534
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,708
the only reason
i started talking to you

1535
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,444
was because i thought you might
be able to explain amy.

1536
01:12:27,477 --> 01:12:28,912
but i should have known,
you don't know the first thing

1537
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:30,580
about anybody in your family,

1538
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,383
'cause that's the safest
way to be--deaf, dumb and blind.

1539
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:35,819
- look, son, i don't claim
to know everything, because--

1540
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,654
- that way you don't have
to realize anything around you,

1541
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,689
and you just go on pretending
that you love them all,

1542
01:12:39,723 --> 01:12:40,924
because it's a nice, safe habit.

1543
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,058
- because if i knew everything,
i'd be like you,

1544
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,192
and from what i can see--

1545
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:45,529
- it gives you that phony
feeling of self-importance

1546
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:46,930
to think that they all
love you back.

1547
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:48,064
the truth of the matter is,
none of you know

1548
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:49,733
the first damn thing
about love!

1549
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:51,701
none of you!

1550
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,003
- but of course, mademoiselle.

1551
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:29,138
money isn't everything.

1552
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:31,675
has it brought me happiness?

1553
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:34,978
one asks these things
of oneself when...

1554
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:36,580
- good morning, elliott.

1555
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:39,449
may i see that, please?

1556
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:42,786
oh, i thought maybe you'd robbed
a bank or something.

1557
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,053
- well, it's for
appearance's sake, pop.

1558
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,855
i may be the poorest american
in paris,

1559
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:46,956
but there's no point
in advertising.

1560
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:47,891
- i see.

1561
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,726
- and incidentally,
speaking of money--

1562
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,060
- elliott, i am

the day off arguing

1564
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:53,863
about your allowance.

1565
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:54,998

1570
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,609
how would you like to go to
the louvre with me this morning?

1571
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:06,876
- oh, it's too nice
a day, pop.

1572
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:09,879

1573
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:13,550
- okay, then i'll go
by myself.

1574
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,884
hmm.

1575
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,020
- bonjour, monsieur.

1576
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,556
- oh, bonjour.

1577
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:54,257
say, the louvre.

1578
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,893
that opens at 10:00,
n'est-ce pas?

1579
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:57,961
- that is correct, monsieur.

1580
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,295
- bon.

1581
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,931

01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:14,578

1587
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:15,745

1588
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:17,881

1589
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:19,148

- good.
i mean, bon.

1591
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,872

for a cigarette?

1592
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:45,141
- oh, no, thank you.
i don't smoke before breakfast.

1593
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:47,944

01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:52,081

1595
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:53,717
- certainly.

1596
01:15:56,653 --> 01:15:58,988
- monsieur?
- oh, merci.

1597
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:00,824
uh?
- oh, thank you.

1598
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:04,994
[speaking french]
- [speaking french]

1599
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:06,129
- you're american?

1600
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,898
- yes, i guess it shows, huh?

1601
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:11,100
- rich, of course.

1602
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,268
- no, no, no,
i'm afraid not.

1603
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:16,372
i'm a plumbing contractor,
but i guess everybody thinks

1604
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:20,176
anyone who has anything
to do with plumbing is rich.

1605
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,778
- so now you have come
to france.

1606
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,279
why?

1607
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,882
- well, i guess,
way down, every american

1608
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,351
is sort of in love with france,
and sooner or later,

1609
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:29,819
if he gets the chance,
he comes over here

1610
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:33,623
to find out why.

1611
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:34,624
- oh.

1612
01:16:34,658 --> 01:16:36,025
merci.

1613
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:39,863
there are many
beautiful things here--

1614
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:43,399
the countryside, the arts,
the restaurants.

1615
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,769
- yes, i'm really
enjoying it.

1616
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:49,806
- also, there is romance.

1617
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,081
- oh.

1618
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:02,318
well, you're
a very attractive woman.

1619
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,053
- thank you.

1620
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:07,957
- but i, uh--
i have a problem.

1621
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:09,425
- oh, how do you say it?

1622
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,094
you're not understood at home,
and your wife is--

1623
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12,228
- no, no, no, no.

1624
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:14,363
it's just the opposite.
my wife knows me like a book.

1625
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:19,235
the thing is, uh,
i love my wife very much.

1626
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,738
she's the most beautiful
woman in the world,

1627
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:23,439
at least to me she is.

1628
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,775
and we have three kids,
and they're all kind of nutty

1629
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,176
one way or another,

1630
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:31,080
but i'm crazy
about them too, so, uh...

1631
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:36,185
- [speaking french]

1632
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:37,320
- i beg your pardon?

1633
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,022
- oh, i'm sorry.

1634
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:43,192
i said, "i believe you truly
are a rich american."

1635
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:44,694
- oh.

1636
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:53,036
i hope you'll enjoy
your stay in france.

1637
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:55,304
- i'm sure i will.

1638
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,273
- it was very pleasant
to meet you.

1639
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:59,442
- thank you.

1640
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:00,443
- au revoir.

1641
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:03,146
- good-bye.

1642
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:10,920
- your ham and eggs, monsieur.

1643
01:18:10,954 --> 01:18:13,723
- oh.

1644
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:14,791
- garcon?
- monsieur?

1645
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:16,926
- i think i'd like
a small bottle of wine, please.

1646
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,462
- oui, monsieur.

1647
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:20,463
what kind?

1648
01:18:20,496 --> 01:18:23,767
- oh, uh, whatever kind
goes with ham and eggs.

1649
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,134
[chuckles]

1650
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:27,436
- of course.

1651
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:45,188
[horn honking]

1652
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,792
[elliott laughing]

1653
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50,026
[speaking french]

1654
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:53,296
or should i say,
[speaking french]?

1655
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:54,330
i'll tell you something,
you know,

1656
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:55,464
money is very deceptive.

1657
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:56,399
i mean, it's interesting,
you know?

1658
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:57,901
you take money--
well, just to look at me.

1659
01:18:57,934 --> 01:18:59,068
the ordinary person
wouldn't know

1660
01:18:59,102 --> 01:19:00,469
that i had money,
would they?

1661
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:03,339
see, i don't think money
should be an ostentatious thing.

1662
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:06,275
i think it should be sort of
a basic feeling within you

1663
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:08,077
that you know
how to handle yourself

1664
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:09,012
in situations that--

1665
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:12,448
ooh.
oh, hello, pop.

1666
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:14,050
uh, i'm glad you stopped by.

1667
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,384
i want you to meet
a very good friend of mine.

1668
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:18,054
she's, uh, very social.
wonderful family.

1669
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:21,891
she's been telling me about
her studies at the sorbonne.

1670
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:24,060
- is this one of them?

1671
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,028
- yes.

1672
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:28,031
- come on, elliott.
- why, what's going on?

1673
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:29,465
- good-bye, my friend.

1674
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,467
- hey, what's happening?
what's the matter?

1675
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,469
- go with your father, please.

1676
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,038
- elliott.

1677
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:45,481
- uh, mademoiselle,
i'm terribly sorry

1678
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:46,950
we took up
so much of your time.

1679
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:50,219
- it's perfectly all right.

1680
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:52,055
monsieur.

1681
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:54,590
- do you have any other sons
abroad in paris?

1682
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,060
- yes, i have one.

1683
01:19:57,093 --> 01:19:59,062
he's just 12 years old.

1684
01:20:01,064 --> 01:20:03,332
- thank you.

1685
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,471
- now, wait a minute, pop.
listen, let me explain this.

1686
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:10,874
she came to the--
well, look, i'll show you.

1687
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:12,275
i was sitting here,
minding my own business,

1688
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,943
and she came to me.
pop, that's the truth.

1689
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:15,044
she said, "would you like
to have a drink?"

1690
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:17,146
- and i said, "yes,
i would love to have a drink."

1691
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,481
and the next thing i knew,
she sat down,

1692
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:20,950
and we had a drink,
and then you came up.

1693
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:23,086
i didn't know
how much time had gone by.

1694
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:28,824
- hi, mom!
- hello, skipper.

1695
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:30,326
put those in my room,
huh, darling?

1696
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:32,896
- uh-huh.

1697
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,030
- well, harry.
- hi, katie.

1698
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:36,065
- you're back
from the louvre already?

1699
01:20:36,099 --> 01:20:37,333
how was it?

1700
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:38,935
- well, i didn't get there.

1701
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:40,203
it seems that every time
i try to get to the louvre,

1702
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:41,204
something happens.

1703
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:44,073
like this morning,
i was...

1704
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:45,074
- you like it?

1705
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:47,010
- your hair?

1706
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:48,211
what have you done to it?

1707
01:20:48,244 --> 01:20:49,545
- well, it's the latest thing
over here.

1708
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,047
they made it sound
so exciting.

1709
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,315
they said it would change
my whole personality.

1710
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,549
- oh?

1711
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,318
- as soon as i saw it,
i could see your face

1712
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,153
just the way
it looks right now.

1713
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,155
- oh, well...

1714
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,057
hmm.

1715
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,091
you don't like it?

1716
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:05,561
- yeah, yes, it's cute.

1717
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:07,496
- you'd never use that word
unless you loathed it.

1718
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,033
- well, i didn't mean cute.
i mean, it's, uh...

1719
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:11,300
well, it's pretty.

1720
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:13,369
- harry, there's nothing
that makes me angrier

1721
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,238
than having you agree with me
when you don't mean it.

1722
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:18,207
- i do mean it, katie.
i-it's real snazzy.

1723
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:20,076
it's just that--well, you
kind or surprised me,

1724
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:21,010
that's all.
- it'll grow out.

1725
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:23,079
my hair grows very fast.
- oh, now, katie.

1726
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:24,948
- wow, neat-o.

1727
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:26,549
who's your new girlfriend, pop?

1728
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,952
- thank you, skipper.

1729
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:31,587
- and what do you
have to say, elliott?

1730
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,923
- hmm...

1731
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:35,959
well, it does make you
look younger,

1732
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:37,226
if that's your point,

1733
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,695
but i'd always thought
of you as older.

1734
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,231
[doorbell buzzes]
- well, thanks a lot.

1735
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:43,967
that's what your father
thinks too.

1736
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,935
- oh, now, wait a minute, katie.
i don't think any such thing.

1737
01:21:45,969 --> 01:21:47,070
- i wouldn't go in there
if i were you.

1738
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:48,337
pop hates mom's new hairdo.

1739
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:49,538
- i do not hate it.

1740
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,975
all i said to your mother
was, "what have you done to it?"

1741
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,442
i didn't mean--
- oh, mother.

1742
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:56,645
it's the most stunning thing
i've ever seen--

1743
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:58,214
absolutely divine.

1744
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,315
- is that so, dear?

1745
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:01,417
- i really like it, katie.

1746
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,452
- mother, you're going to drive
all the men in paris

1747
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:04,687
out of their minds.

1748
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,689
wait till they see you
at the party tonight.

1749
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:08,091
- party?

1750
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:11,227
- yes, and do you know
who's invited us?

1751
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,229
the comtesse.
the comtesse dufresne.

1752
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,597
- who's that?

1753
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,599
- the comtesse,
nick's mother.

1754
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,234
- nick's mother?

1755
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,970
- yes, she has this famous
house in autet.

1756
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:23,106
absolutely everybody
in paris will be there,

1757
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,174
because she's introducing
her new protege--

1758
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,510
a young argentine
concert pianist,

1759
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:29,712
her third protege
in six months.

1760
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:32,381
- but i, uh--i thought
after what happened yesterday,

1761
01:22:32,415 --> 01:22:33,182
you and nick were all-

1762
01:22:33,216 --> 01:22:36,085
- oh, daddy,
that was yesterday.

1763
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:37,086
- oh.

1764
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,055
- well, anyway,
she found out about nick and me,

1765
01:22:39,088 --> 01:22:40,489
so nothing would do,
but she had to have

1766
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:42,091
us all out there
to look us over.

1767
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,559
- to look us over?

1768
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:45,061
- well, certainly.

1769
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:47,163
she's probably
very jealous about nick,

1770
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:48,164
but i want to keep
an open mind about her.

1771
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:49,632
- oh, of course.

1772
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:52,035
- come on, mother, we've got
to figure out what to wear.

1773
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:54,103
- katie, i don't think
we ought to get mixed up--

1774
01:22:54,137 --> 01:22:56,105
- oh, harry, this is paris,
darling, remember?

1775
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:58,074
worst comes to worst,
we'll have a marvelous time

1776
01:22:58,107 --> 01:23:00,076
seeing all these people.
- yeah.

1777
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:02,245
- amy, do you think my
black sheath is dressy enough?

1778
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:05,148
- katie, i thought
you were on my side.

1779
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:22,131
[indistinct chatter]

1780
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:34,243
- if my luck holds out,
she won't be here tonight.

1781
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:35,344
- excuse me.
- yes, dear.

1782
01:23:35,378 --> 01:23:36,712
- mother, the willards
have arrived.

1783
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,381
- oh.

1784
01:23:38,414 --> 01:23:43,219
hold that for me, please.
come along, darling.

1785
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:47,490
baron.

1786
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:51,727
[speaking german]

1787
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,363
darlings, darlings,
darlings, no, no, no, no.

1788
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:56,765
don't tell me who you are.
you're the willards.

1789
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:59,402
aren't your precious,
mrs. willard?

1790
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:03,672
adorable, mr. willard--
so tall and handsome.

1791
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:05,774
isn't he the longest thing?

1792
01:24:05,808 --> 01:24:09,112
and you must be amy.

1793
01:24:09,145 --> 01:24:11,780
why, you're a raving beauty.

1794
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:14,117
why, amy, you charmer.

1795
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:17,120
no wonder you've driven
my darling nicky-poo

1796
01:24:17,153 --> 01:24:18,487
to distraction.

1797
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:19,655
- this is my mother.

1798
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:21,090
- come along, dears,
come along.

1799
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:24,127
[gasps] such a ghastly party,
darlings--

1800
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,129
one of my very worst.

1801
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:28,197
but all the most amusing people
are in the cote d'azur

1802
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:29,498
this time of year.

1803
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:31,100
no one here
but the sweepings, the dregs,

1804
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:34,403
the absolute dregs of paris.
[laughs]

1805
01:24:34,437 --> 01:24:35,871
but i just couldn't wait
another minute

1806
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,873
to show off
my darling carlos.

1807
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,508
there he is over there
at the piano.

1808
01:24:45,181 --> 01:24:49,118
what a deliciously evil face
he has, don't you think?

1809
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:50,586
if there's one thing
i can't stand

1810
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:51,887
it's a clean-cut man.

1811
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,123
what did you say
your name was, dear?

1812
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:56,459
- oh, katie.
- kate--katie?

1813
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:59,795
oh, how charming,
how honest and true,

1814
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:02,898
how american, moon shining
over the back fence.

1815
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,333
how in sweet hades, katie,
do you manage

1816
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:05,468
to keep your looks--

1817
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:06,902
i mean, grown-up children
and all?

1818
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:10,273
every man in this room is dying
to get his hands on you.

1819
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:12,341
come on, darlings.
come on, dears, come along.

1820
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:15,411
- oh, harry,
that's so silly.

1821
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:19,148
- oh, katie, darling.

1822
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:21,384
come along.

1823
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:23,819
- harry, i--

1824
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,389
- i want you to meet
the most divine man.

1825
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:28,724
he hasn't taken his eyes off you
since you came in.

1826
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,234
- monsieur.
- uh, no, no, thanks.

1827
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:40,936
uh, wait a minute, maybe this
little thing right here.

1828
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,806
what do you call this?

1829
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:45,774
oh, you don't speak
english, huh?

1830
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,876
- [speaking french]

1831
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:50,213
it lifts off
the inhibitions, monsieur.

1832
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:52,781
allows one to gaze
at one's inner being.

1833
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:54,883
- well.
- tres desirable, no?

1834
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:59,955
- well, yeah, i've been thinking
about doing that very thing.

1835
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,524
hey, that's very tasty.

1836
01:26:01,557 --> 01:26:03,259
you mean that's real liquor?

1837
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:05,561
it kind of tastes like
licorice water.

1838
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:07,430
- ooh, ooh, ooh,
sip it slowly, monsieur.

1839
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:10,399
such a drink does not
make friends in a hurry.

1840
01:26:10,433 --> 01:26:14,169
- well, thanks very much.

1841
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,814
- [laughs]
my darlings.

1842
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,950
the most amusing thing--

1843
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:32,221
my dearest nicky,
so charming and handsome,

1844
01:26:32,255 --> 01:26:35,224
wants to go to work.

1845
01:26:35,258 --> 01:26:36,292
- nicky?
[speaking french]

1846
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:37,760
- starting as a little mouse

1847
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:41,930
in some dreary architect's
office back in the states.

1848
01:26:41,964 --> 01:26:44,233
can you imagine
our nicholas

1849
01:26:44,267 --> 01:26:47,236
sharpening pencils,
buying sandwiches,

1850
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,638
running errands?
[laughter]

1851
01:26:49,672 --> 01:26:51,006
- cut it out, mother.
- nicky, darling.

1852
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,409
if you don't like my money
and you want to earn

1853
01:26:53,442 --> 01:26:55,678
a bit of your own,
i'll speak to some

1854
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,414
of my dear, dull friends,
and you can have

1855
01:26:58,447 --> 01:27:00,349
all the commissions
you want,

1856
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:05,821
building lovely buildings
all over europe.

1857
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:07,623
and he can have
his own little people

1858
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,825
to run errands
and sharpen pencils.

1859
01:27:09,858 --> 01:27:14,497
now, why are you glaring
at me that way, nicky darling?

1860
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:15,864
everything's so ridiculous.

1861
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,972
- lovely woman.

1862
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:26,342
- oh. oh.

1863
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:32,381
yes, that happens to be--

1864
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:34,016
- poor creature comes
innocently to paris

1865
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:36,018
and runs dead-on into the leader
of the wolf pack.

1866
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:36,919
- who?

1867
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:39,021
- the devil himself,
rudolph hunschak.

1868
01:27:39,054 --> 01:27:40,956
- oh.

1869
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:42,958
- are you going to say
you've never heard of him?

1870
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,560
- no, i'm sorry,
i haven't.

1871
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,762
- hunschak is the most
dangerous man in europe.

1872
01:27:46,795 --> 01:27:49,832
- for women?
- for husbands.

1873
01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:52,368
rudolph's only interested
in a woman if she's married.

1874
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:54,837
it's his speciality.
- oh.

1875
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:56,038
well, i'm afraid
he's going to have

1876
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:57,973
a little problem
this time.

1877
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,942
- afraid you don't know
your man, old chap.

1878
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:02,911
rudolph never gives up
until he wins.

1879
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:06,715
- i'm afraid you don't know
your woman, old chap.

1880
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:10,319
- you don't mean to say
that you're the--

1881
01:28:10,353 --> 01:28:15,324
i say, old man,
i'm most terribly sorry i...

1882
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:25,701
- very good.

1883
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:29,037
say, if you don't mind,
i, uh, feel kind of silly

1884
01:28:29,071 --> 01:28:33,709
walking around with
this little eyedropper, so...

1885
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:35,811
i bet you it'll save you
a few steps.

1886
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:36,979
oh, i'm sorry.

1887
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:38,714
i keep forgetting
you don't speak english.

1888
01:28:38,747 --> 01:28:40,015
merci.

1889
01:29:02,805 --> 01:29:04,573
- i'm sorry, nick.

1890
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:05,974
- who does she think
she's kidding?

1891
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:09,545
she's not about
to turn me loose, not her.

1892
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:10,979
oh, she might go
for a wedding, all right.

1893
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:14,116
give her a chance to play
the doting mother for a while.

1894
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:15,718
but afterward, honey,
she'd sabotage you

1895
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:16,985
in three days flat.

1896
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,954
- nick, forget
about you and me.

1897
01:29:18,987 --> 01:29:20,656
that's done with.

1898
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,991
but honestly, don't you think
you ought to get away from here,

1899
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,860
get a job,
find a place for yourself--

1900
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:26,462
- amy.

1901
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:29,131
mother's a bizarre old girl,
but she's smart.

1902
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:30,866
she knows me better
than i do myself.

1903
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:32,568
she knows i couldn't make it
in a lousy job

1904
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:34,069
back in new york.
- nick, you're not--

1905
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:35,471
- so do yourself a favor.
just stay out of this.

1906
01:29:35,504 --> 01:29:37,105
- you're not being
fair to yourself.

1907
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:40,175
- [speaking french]

1908
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,711
- i'm sorry,
what did you say?

1909
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:45,714
- she said, would you be angry
if she danced with me?

1910
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:48,183
- [speaking french]

1911
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,185
mademoiselle amy...
[speaking french]

1912
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,854
- merci.

1913
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,722
- nick.

1914
01:29:53,756 --> 01:29:55,458
- look, amy.

1915
01:29:55,491 --> 01:29:58,126
eloisa's perfectly satisfied
with me the way i am.

1916
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,130
she isn't trying
to change me.

1917
01:30:11,173 --> 01:30:12,741
- harry.

1918
01:30:12,775 --> 01:30:14,577
- oh, there you are, katie.

1919
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:16,879
- i'd like to go home now.
- go home?

1920
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,881
home's thousands
of miles away, katie.

1921
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:20,849
we're in paris.
enjoy yourself, have fun.

1922
01:30:20,883 --> 01:30:22,451
isn't that what
we're here for?

1923
01:30:22,485 --> 01:30:24,119
hey, what happened
to the boyfriend?

1924
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:25,688
- you stop that.

1925
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:27,189
what's the matter with you?
stop it, you hear me?

1926
01:30:27,222 --> 01:30:28,991
- how can i hear you, katie,
with all this

1927
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,593
gay parisian gaiety
going on?

1928
01:30:30,626 --> 01:30:31,927
- what is the matter with you?

1929
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:32,861
i've never seen you
like this before.

1930
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:34,830
- i've never been
like this before, katie.

1931
01:30:34,863 --> 01:30:35,964
i'm awake.
i'm alive.

1932
01:30:35,998 --> 01:30:37,866
for the first time,
i see my wife

1933
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,968
as she really is--
a femme fatale.

1934
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:41,870
men falling all over themselves
trying to get near you,

1935
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:43,872
kissing your hand...
- oh, harry, now, that's--

1936
01:30:43,906 --> 01:30:45,541
- making love to you
with their eyes.

1937
01:30:45,574 --> 01:30:46,542
ooh, here he comes now.

1938
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:48,477
- here you are, madame.

1939
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:50,078
- thank you.

1940
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:51,747
- you are undoubtedly
the husband.

1941
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,482
- oui.
- i'm rudolph hunschak.

1942
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:55,150
i've been enjoying your wife--

1943
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:58,153
so sparkling, so charming,
so fresh.

1944
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:00,889
- you're a little fresh
yourself, rudolph.

1945
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:02,057
i've heard about you.

1946
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:03,325
they tell me
you're quite a character.

1947
01:31:03,358 --> 01:31:06,261
but that's okay, just as long
as katie's having a good time.

1948
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,564
- it's getting very late.

1949
01:31:08,597 --> 01:31:11,199
- such lovely hair,
so distinct.

1950
01:31:11,233 --> 01:31:13,201
who but someone
with a face like madame

1951
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:16,271
can make this style
a personal triumph?

1952
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,740
- oh, really?

1953
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:20,576
you should have seen it
the old way.

1954
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:22,711
- it's getting very late.

1955
01:31:22,745 --> 01:31:24,880
- now, katie, it's just
the shank of the evening.

1956
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:25,881
- oh, no, mr. willard.

1957
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:28,216
better you take
the lovely madame safely away.

1958
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:31,153
with many men around here,
it's not safe.

1959
01:31:31,186 --> 01:31:33,288
- katie?
[laughs]

1960
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:36,291
my wife would be
safe anyplace.

1961
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,561
oh, now, katie,
i didn't mean it quite that way.

1962
01:31:38,594 --> 01:31:41,163
- i would like to go home.

1963
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:42,297
- madame willard
has been discussing you.

1964
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,165
she will speak
of little else.

1965
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:46,869
she warned me
of your violent temper.

1966
01:31:46,902 --> 01:31:50,138
but now that i meet you,
i see that she exaggerates.

1967
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:52,741
- ah, pardon me, sweetheart.

1968
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:54,843
did she also happen to mention
that i was once

1969
01:31:54,877 --> 01:31:56,745
a professional wrestler?
- wrestler?

1970
01:31:56,779 --> 01:31:59,081
what is this--oh.

1971
01:31:59,114 --> 01:32:00,583
i see that
you're pulling my leg.

1972
01:32:00,616 --> 01:32:03,018
- [laughing]
brother, when i pull your leg,

1973
01:32:03,051 --> 01:32:05,020
you're going to know it.

1974
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:06,889
[laughs]
take it easy, katie.

1975
01:32:06,922 --> 01:32:10,125
we're just having a little
friendly discussion, that's all.

1976
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:11,694
oh.

1977
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:13,629
oh...

1978
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:26,141
boy, you do get around,
don't you?

1979
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:31,046
oh, don't go away.
don't go away.

1980
01:32:36,919 --> 01:32:40,255
merci.

1981
01:32:57,673 --> 01:32:59,842
hi, baby.

1982
01:32:59,875 --> 01:33:03,912
why aren't you in there
"folderolling" around?

1983
01:33:03,946 --> 01:33:06,248
- nicholas o'mara, esquire.

1984
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:10,118
boy, i guess i know him
for what he really is now.

1985
01:33:10,152 --> 01:33:12,621
"get a job," i said.

1986
01:33:12,655 --> 01:33:14,122
that's funny.

1987
01:33:14,156 --> 01:33:18,627
he's the original hollow reed,
that's what he is.

1988
01:33:18,661 --> 01:33:21,997
- well, now, i think maybe
that's about enough of that.

1989
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:25,768
not that i'm jealous--
i don't get jealous.

1990
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:30,806
i don't like it--
that's what it boils down to.

1991
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:37,112
- without his loving mother
to back him up,

1992
01:33:37,145 --> 01:33:40,148
he couldn't get a job
pouring water out of a boot.

1993
01:33:45,087 --> 01:33:48,857
- some husbands would be
jealous, but not me.

1994
01:33:48,891 --> 01:33:52,160
but i can get annoyed.

1995
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:06,909
- daddy, i know you don't want
to spoil mother's fun,

1996
01:34:06,942 --> 01:34:09,244
but i feel like a perfect fool
staying around here.

1997
01:34:09,277 --> 01:34:12,147
will you take me
back to the hotel?

1998
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,449
- you know that little fellow
with the beard was right.

1999
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:19,087
this stuff really loosens
up your inhibitions.

2000
01:34:23,959 --> 01:34:28,330
now, this isn't a sudden impulse
on my part, mind you.

2001
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:30,232
i thought of it way back--
well, shortly after

2002
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:32,034
i sat down here.

2003
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:35,237
i reasoned the whole thing out
very "calculataly"--

2004
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,106
uh, very carefully.

2005
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,908
- daddy, are you all right?

2006
01:34:39,942 --> 01:34:42,044
- no reason in the world
why i shouldn't do it.

2007
01:34:42,077 --> 01:34:43,411
of course
there might be a couple,

2008
01:34:43,445 --> 01:34:44,913
but we'll just ignore them.

2009
01:34:44,947 --> 01:34:46,248
- do what?

2010
01:34:46,281 --> 01:34:49,051
- hang one nice big shandy
on rudolph,

2011
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:53,789
the red-nosed hungarian.

2012
01:34:53,822 --> 01:34:55,090
now...

2013
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:01,229
- daddy.

2014
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:18,313
daddy?
- oh.

2015
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:21,917
hi, baby.

2016
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:24,319
oh, boy.

2017
01:35:24,352 --> 01:35:26,054
did i hit him
or vice versa?

2018
01:35:26,088 --> 01:35:29,257
- no, i'm afraid
what you were drinking

2019
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:31,293
got you first.

2020
01:35:31,326 --> 01:35:34,196
- that's too bad.

2021
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:36,431
it was that green-liquor stuff.

2022
01:35:36,464 --> 01:35:38,066
i remember
when i was a kid once,

2023
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,136
i got sick from eating
too much licorice.

2024
01:35:41,169 --> 01:35:42,037
- here, daddy, drink this.
- no, no.

2025
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,171
i don't think i'd better.

2026
01:35:43,205 --> 01:35:44,907
- come on, it'll be
good for you.

2027
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,075
- well, okay.

2028
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:50,813
i-i-i can sit up, i-i think.

2029
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:52,848
yeah.

2030
01:35:57,085 --> 01:36:00,022
that's enough.

2031
01:36:00,055 --> 01:36:03,058
[sighs]

2032
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:03,992
oh, you poor kid.

2033
01:36:04,026 --> 01:36:05,861
you left the party
on account of me, huh?

2034
01:36:05,894 --> 01:36:08,864
where's your mother?
has she gone to bed?

2035
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:10,432
- oh, no,
she's still at the party.

2036
01:36:10,465 --> 01:36:12,901
- still at the party?

2037
01:36:12,935 --> 01:36:14,937
oh, she doesn't know, huh?

2038
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:16,939
- oh, daddy,
i didn't want to upset her.

2039
01:36:16,972 --> 01:36:18,406
you were absolutely green.

2040
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,942
- i-i...

2041
01:36:19,975 --> 01:36:21,476
- besides, a nice cab driver
helped me get you

2042
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:23,078
out through the terrace
and back to the hotel.

2043
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,080
- that was nice of him.
- here, finish this.

2044
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,215
- no, no, no, no,
no, thanks.

2045
01:36:27,249 --> 01:36:29,818
hey, i've got to go
and rescue your mother

2046
01:36:29,852 --> 01:36:31,486
from that hungarian
wolfhound.

2047
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:33,155
- ooh, daddy.
hadn't you better rest?

2048
01:36:33,188 --> 01:36:34,156
- no, no, no.

2049
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:36,458
there's a time for rest
and a time for action.

2050
01:36:36,491 --> 01:36:38,060
where--where's my coat?

2051
01:36:38,093 --> 01:36:39,461
- uh, it's over there.
- all right.

2052
01:36:39,494 --> 01:36:41,930
now, you better
go to bed now.

2053
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:44,499
thanks for taking care of me.
good night.

2054
01:38:06,248 --> 01:38:07,349
- harry?
- hmm?

2055
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,084
oh, hi, there.
- are you all right?

2056
01:38:09,117 --> 01:38:10,318
- all right?

2057
01:38:10,352 --> 01:38:13,221
what could happen to me?
of course i'm all right.

2058
01:38:13,255 --> 01:38:15,057
- well, where have you been?

2059
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:16,191
- oh, out on the town.

2060
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,627
you know, the way you're
supposed to be in gay old paris.

2061
01:38:19,661 --> 01:38:20,963
- you're upset, aren't you?

2062
01:38:20,996 --> 01:38:24,066
- upset? me?
[laughs]

2063
01:38:24,099 --> 01:38:25,968
- well, that's hilarious.
- oh, sure, that's me.

2064
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:27,936
good old hilarious harry--

2065
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:30,472
always there to come home to.

2066
01:38:30,505 --> 01:38:34,642
- harry, i want you
to listen to me.

2067
01:38:34,676 --> 01:38:36,611
are you listening?
- mm.

2068
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:38,046
- well, now, why didn't you--

2069
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,982
will you listen to me?

2070
01:38:40,015 --> 01:38:41,349
- oh, if you think
it's important, i'll listen.

2071
01:38:41,383 --> 01:38:42,350
go ahead.
- we'll you'd better.

2072
01:38:42,384 --> 01:38:43,685
you just better.

2073
01:38:43,718 --> 01:38:45,087
now why didn't you
lend a helping hand

2074
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,254
back at the party?

2075
01:38:46,288 --> 01:38:48,957
you could see i needed help
to get rid of that leech.

2076
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:50,092
- oh, now, katie,
is that any way to talk

2077
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:53,295
about a dashing hungarian romeo
who's just taken you out

2078
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:54,629
for a beautiful evening?

2079
01:38:54,662 --> 01:38:56,598
- now get off
your high horse.

2080
01:38:56,631 --> 01:38:57,732
- you know, hon, i'm hungry.

2081
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,467
i think i'll have
something sent up.

2082
01:38:59,501 --> 01:39:01,503
you don't mind
if i eat while you talk, do you?

2083
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:02,304
maybe you'd like to join me.

2084
01:39:02,337 --> 01:39:04,973
how about some
hungarian goulash?

2085
01:39:05,007 --> 01:39:07,642
- harry willard, now you shut up
and listen to me.

2086
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:09,711
you know how i feel
about other men,

2087
01:39:09,744 --> 01:39:11,513
all other men,

2088
01:39:11,546 --> 01:39:13,315
and especially those
unattached handsome joes

2089
01:39:13,348 --> 01:39:15,617
that go around making a pass
at everyone woman they meet.

2090
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:17,219
- oh, you think
he's handsome, do you?

2091
01:39:17,252 --> 01:39:19,254
and when did he make the pass--
in the taxi?

2092
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,256
- rudolph didn't exactly--
- you call him rudolph now.

2093
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:22,190
why not "rudy?"

2094
01:39:22,224 --> 01:39:24,226
i couldn't help
knowing his name, could i?

2095
01:39:24,259 --> 01:39:26,061
i've been with the man
for four hours.

2096
01:39:26,094 --> 01:39:27,295
- did i ask you
where you've been?

2097
01:39:27,329 --> 01:39:30,098
did i ask you once?
- well, i'm telling you.

2098
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:32,100
- i don't know what you're
so charged up about, katie.

2099
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:33,568
i think i'm being
a perfect gentleman,

2100
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:35,237
under the circumstances.

2101
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:36,338
- well, what about
the circumstances

2102
01:39:36,371 --> 01:39:38,173
of you getting stoned
and leaving me

2103
01:39:38,206 --> 01:39:39,774
high and dry
at the party?

2104
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,709
i'm not saying anything
about the fact

2105
01:39:41,743 --> 01:39:43,645
that rudolph thought he glimpsed
you leaving the party

2106
01:39:43,678 --> 01:39:45,247
with a young girl,

2107
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,215
because i don't believe it--
not you.

2108
01:39:47,249 --> 01:39:49,784
- oh, you know me backward
and forwards, don't you?

2109
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,087
i don't suppose you thought
to call the hotel here.

2110
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:55,057
- i did!
well, rather, rudolph did.

2111
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,658
he called twice
and said no one answered.

2112
01:39:56,691 --> 01:39:58,526
- oh, that's what he said, huh?
- yes, he did.

2113
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,662
and he also said he knew
every bar in paris

2114
01:40:00,695 --> 01:40:02,797
where americans wander into
when they've had too many.

2115
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,633
- oh.
- so he volunteered to help.

2116
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:08,103
- i bet he just couldn't
wait to find me.

2117
01:40:08,136 --> 01:40:09,371
- harry, if you're going
to be jealous,

2118
01:40:09,404 --> 01:40:11,239
i'd rather you stop
pussyfooting around

2119
01:40:11,273 --> 01:40:12,774
and come right out
and be jealous.

2120
01:40:12,807 --> 01:40:15,243
don't build it
into something else.

2121
01:40:15,277 --> 01:40:17,345
- oh, you mean
there's something else?

2122
01:40:17,379 --> 01:40:20,182
- if you don't stop this,
i'm going to throw something.

2123
01:40:20,215 --> 01:40:21,516
- all right,
how about something heavy?

2124
01:40:21,549 --> 01:40:23,185
how about this?

2125
01:40:23,218 --> 01:40:25,253
- oh, harry, sit down,
and let's be calm.

2126
01:40:25,287 --> 01:40:28,656
- i'm calm.
- well, sit down, anyway.

2127
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,126
i couldn't help it.

2128
01:40:31,159 --> 01:40:32,227
i know rudolph pulled
a fast one.

2129
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,462
he didn't know where you were,
and he didn't care.

2130
01:40:34,496 --> 01:40:35,663
he wanted to be alone with me.

2131
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:37,132
- aha, then you do admit that.

2132
01:40:37,165 --> 01:40:39,667
- damnation, harry,
damnation.

2133
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:41,269
- shh, we have neighbors,
you know.

2134
01:40:41,303 --> 01:40:42,670
- damnation
to the neighbors too.

2135
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:44,206
i have something
i want to tell you.

2136
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,640
- all right, go ahead.

2137
01:40:45,673 --> 01:40:47,342
- well, when i came out
of the last bar,

2138
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:50,112
looking for you,
i called a taxi.

2139
01:40:50,145 --> 01:40:52,480
well, friend rudolph
hopped into the taxi with me.

2140
01:40:52,514 --> 01:40:54,116
and then driving
through the park--

2141
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:55,783
- through the park?
- yes, through the park.

2142
01:40:55,817 --> 01:40:57,585
how do i know
what he told the driver?

2143
01:40:57,619 --> 01:40:59,254
he kissed me.

2144
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:00,655
- he kissed you?
- yes.

2145
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:02,390
now, you see,
i'm telling you everything.

2146
01:41:02,424 --> 01:41:05,127
and i slapped him hard
and did that feel good.

2147
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,461
- the kiss?
- the slap!

2148
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:07,795
- oh.

2149
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:11,333
- then i told the taxi driver
to bring me here tout suite.

2150
01:41:11,366 --> 01:41:13,135
and i come in here to this,

2151
01:41:13,168 --> 01:41:15,803
to you, acting like this,
when it was all your fault

2152
01:41:15,837 --> 01:41:17,272
to begin with.

2153
01:41:17,305 --> 01:41:20,142
and a lot
of appreciation i get,

2154
01:41:20,175 --> 01:41:22,677
traipsing all over town
looking for you.

2155
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:24,412
and if you don't take
that expression off your face,

2156
01:41:24,446 --> 01:41:25,547
i'm going to slap it.

2157
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:28,250
- all i know is
it's very difficult

2158
01:41:28,283 --> 01:41:30,652
to kiss a girl when she
doesn't want to be kissed.

2159
01:41:30,685 --> 01:41:33,121
- why, you--

2160
01:41:33,155 --> 01:41:35,123
now i hope you're satisfied.

2161
01:41:35,157 --> 01:41:36,891
- do you want to get us
tossed out of here?

2162
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:40,362
you might have hit
somebody down there.

2163
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,299
katie.

2164
01:41:46,168 --> 01:41:48,503
katie.

2165
01:42:20,535 --> 01:42:22,270
- you ought to come
back in, pop.

2166
01:42:22,304 --> 01:42:25,240
the water's great.
[laughter]

2167
01:42:25,273 --> 01:42:27,475
- my french is pretty bad.

2168
01:42:27,509 --> 01:42:30,212
i want to ask you,
what's the word for this?

2169
01:42:30,245 --> 01:42:31,946
- la cheveux.

2170
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:34,349
- la cheveux?
- oui.

2171
01:42:34,382 --> 01:42:35,683
- good, great.

2172
01:42:35,717 --> 01:42:37,819
now--now, what's the word
for this?

2173
01:42:37,852 --> 01:42:40,255
- la oeil.
- la oeil?

2174
01:42:40,288 --> 01:42:42,390
- [laughing] no.
la oeil.

2175
01:42:42,424 --> 01:42:43,391
- la oeil.
- oui.

2176
01:42:43,425 --> 01:42:44,959
- oh, je comprends,
je comprends.

2177
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,294
now--now, what's this?
what's this right there?

2178
01:42:46,328 --> 01:42:48,263
- la bouche.

2179
01:42:48,296 --> 01:42:51,199
- la bouche.
- oui.

2180
01:42:51,233 --> 01:42:53,835
- now, what's this right here?

2181
01:42:59,807 --> 01:43:01,476
- well, one thing you've got
to say about that kid.

2182
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:03,778
he knows how to make an asset
out of a language barrier.

2183
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:07,249
- how do you like
elliott's mustache, pop?

2184
01:43:07,282 --> 01:43:10,752
- i think i like the one
on the girl's mother better.

2185
01:43:10,785 --> 01:43:13,688
- she sure is keeping
a close watch on him.

2186
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:15,957
- personally,
i don't blame her.

2187
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:18,926
- one thing--they sure got
a lot of girls around here.

2188
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,830
- yeah, that one-track mind
of elliott's is liable to crack

2189
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:25,667
under the whole
wonderful strain.

2190
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,769
- hola, monsieur.

2191
01:43:27,802 --> 01:43:29,437
- merci, monsieur.

[speaking french]

2193
01:43:31,273 --> 01:43:34,342
s'il vous plait.
- oui.

2194
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:50,758
- oh, no, monsieur.
keep the change.

2195
01:43:50,792 --> 01:43:53,328
- merci beaucoup, monsieur.

2196
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:59,567
- you know, money's like a bird.
it comes, and it goes.

2197
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:17,919
[knock at door]

2198
01:44:17,952 --> 01:44:18,786
- oh.

2199
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:22,290
- madame willard.
- oh, merci.

2200
01:44:35,069 --> 01:44:37,705
- why, harry...

2201
01:44:37,739 --> 01:44:40,074
you're a darling.
thank you.

2202
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:41,909
- uh, katie.
- you didn't need to apologize.

2203
01:44:41,943 --> 01:44:43,077
it was just as much
my fault in paris

2204
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,779
as it was yours.
- now, look, katie.

2205
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:45,780
- you always send me flowers
when you feel guilty

2206
01:44:45,813 --> 01:44:46,648
about something.

2207
01:44:46,681 --> 01:44:47,982
- i don't feel guilty
about anything,

2208
01:44:48,015 --> 01:44:49,050
and i didn't send you
the flowers.

2209
01:44:49,083 --> 01:44:51,853
if anybody should
feel guilt about something...

2210
01:44:51,886 --> 01:44:55,457
"dear madame willard"--
i suppose it should be will-ard.

2211
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:57,091
"is it not
a beautiful coincidence

2212
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,093
"that i happened to arrive
on business?

2213
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:01,529
"we shall have the opportunity
to continue our conversation,

2214
01:45:01,563 --> 01:45:04,065
"which began so charmingly
in paris.

2215

"kindest regards
to your husband."

2216
01:45:05,066 --> 01:45:06,701
oh, i'll bet.

2217
01:45:06,734 --> 01:45:10,505
"with deep admiration,
rudolph."

2218
01:45:10,538 --> 01:45:11,939
- well, isn't that odd?

2219
01:45:11,973 --> 01:45:13,708
- yes, it is odd.

2220
01:45:13,741 --> 01:45:16,077
how did he find out
we were here?

2221
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:17,979
- well, i don't
really know, dear.

2222
01:45:18,012 --> 01:45:19,714
uh, it could have come out
of a conversation

2223
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:20,848
at the contessa's.

2224
01:45:20,882 --> 01:45:24,085
- oh.

2225
01:45:24,118 --> 01:45:25,953
- but they are lovely,
aren't they?

2226
01:45:25,987 --> 01:45:29,757
- yeah, i guess,
if you happen to like flowers.

2227
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:37,599
[sighs]

2228
01:45:37,632 --> 01:45:39,667
- having a good time, pop?
- [chuckles]

2229
01:45:39,701 --> 01:45:40,735
you know, skipper,

2230
01:45:40,768 --> 01:45:43,538
right now is practically
the first moment of peace

2231
01:45:43,571 --> 01:45:45,607
i've had
since we left terre haute.

2232
01:45:49,577 --> 01:45:50,545
- pop?
- hmm?

2233
01:45:50,578 --> 01:45:51,779
- it's amy.

2234
01:45:51,813 --> 01:45:53,080
- uh, where's she
been keeping herself?

2235
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:55,850
i've hardly seen the girl
since we got down here.

2236
01:45:55,883 --> 01:45:56,984
- pop, you better
take a look.

2237
01:45:57,018 --> 01:45:59,554
- not now.
- pop!

2238
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:00,655
- all right, where?

2239
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:01,989
- you can't miss her.

2240
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:04,058
it's that leopard deal
coming down the boardwalk.

2241
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:05,527
- oh, you must be
mistaken, skipper.

2242
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,362
that couldn't be amy.

2243
01:46:13,968 --> 01:46:15,403
no...

2244
01:46:15,437 --> 01:46:17,371
not my little girl.

2245
01:46:19,474 --> 01:46:21,676
[barking]

[men whistling]

2247
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:28,983
- just what do you
think you're doing?

2248
01:46:29,016 --> 01:46:30,585
- well, mr. o'mara,

2249
01:46:30,618 --> 01:46:33,721
won't the girls in paris
be lonely with you here?

2250
01:46:33,755 --> 01:46:34,989
- what are you doing
in that creepy suit?

2251
01:46:35,022 --> 01:46:37,592
- will you please
let me alone?

2252
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:38,993
- i suggest you do
as mademoiselle wishes.

2253
01:46:39,026 --> 01:46:40,662
- now, what's the idea
exposing yourself

2254
01:46:40,695 --> 01:46:41,863
to everyone like that?

2255
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:43,197
- strange--

2256
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:46,601
i thought you liked your girls
easy and breezy.

2257
01:46:46,634 --> 01:46:48,135
well, maybe i'm just
a little bit tired

2258
01:46:48,169 --> 01:46:51,439
of being sweet, square amy
from terre haute.

2259
01:46:51,473 --> 01:46:54,208
- shut up and get
back to the hotel...

2260
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:56,478
right now, and put on
something decent.

2261
01:46:56,511 --> 01:46:57,979
- monsieur, you are becoming
a nuisance.

2262
01:46:58,012 --> 01:46:59,847
- please, nick.
- i said, put some clothes on,

2263
01:46:59,881 --> 01:47:02,917
and i mean it.

2264
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:04,986
- will you let me go?
- amy!

2265
01:47:05,019 --> 01:47:07,722
hey, fellows, now--

2266
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:09,991
amy!

- [crying]

2278
01:49:19,754 --> 01:49:22,790
- i'm sorry, baby,
so very sorry.

2279
01:49:24,792 --> 01:49:29,597
- i guess i'm just not
as grown-up as i thought i was.

2280
01:49:29,631 --> 01:49:33,034
- i don't like seeing things
like this happen to you.

2281
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:36,771
i feel so helpless.

2282
01:49:36,804 --> 01:49:38,239
when you were a little girl,
i always knew what to do,

2283
01:49:38,272 --> 01:49:41,108
but now i--

2284
01:49:41,142 --> 01:49:45,647
- only one person can help me
now, daddy, and that's me.

2285
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:48,049
i'm never going
to see nick again.

2286
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:50,017
you were right
about him all along.

2287
01:49:50,051 --> 01:49:52,219
- i don't want
to be right, amy.

2288
01:49:52,253 --> 01:49:53,988
i just want you
to be happy.

2289
01:49:54,021 --> 01:49:57,158
i know nothing i could say
right now could help.

2290
01:49:57,191 --> 01:50:00,227
only one more day, baby,
and we'll be leaving for home,

2291
01:50:00,261 --> 01:50:02,029
where we really belong.

2292
01:50:02,063 --> 01:50:04,231
maybe when we get back there,
all this won't seem

2293
01:50:04,265 --> 01:50:08,035
so important, hmm?

2294
01:50:08,069 --> 01:50:10,938
- [crying]

2295
01:50:15,076 --> 01:50:17,111
- so tomorrow
we're leaving for home.

2296

[speaking french]

2297
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:24,018
- oui.

2298
01:50:24,051 --> 01:50:26,053
- but first, my wife--
my femme and i

2299
01:50:26,087 --> 01:50:28,322
are going to help you francais
celebrate bastille day.

2300
01:50:28,355 --> 01:50:30,024
tonight we're going
out on the town.

2301
01:50:30,057 --> 01:50:32,126
uh, sur la vie.
- oui.

2302
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,095
- uh, dinner, dancing,
monte carlo.

2303
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:36,230
uh, we're going to shoot
the works.

2304
01:50:36,263 --> 01:50:38,766
[laughing] i don't know
the french for that.

2305
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,435
une plus grande soiree.
- oui, monsieur.

2306
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:43,104
- it sure is a shame
i have to leave france

2307
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:44,772
just when i'm getting
so i can handle the language.

2308
01:50:44,806 --> 01:50:46,908
ne pas?
just put it there.

2309
01:50:46,941 --> 01:50:48,843
s'il vous plait.
- hi, pop.

2310
01:50:48,876 --> 01:50:51,412
- oh, bonjour, elliott.
what's new with you today?

2311
01:50:51,445 --> 01:50:54,782
well, uh,
bonjour, mademoiselle.

2312
01:50:54,816 --> 01:50:56,784
- dad, you remember florelle.

2313
01:50:56,818 --> 01:50:59,787
- no.
- from the beach.

2314
01:50:59,821 --> 01:51:01,388
- oh.

2315
01:51:01,422 --> 01:51:05,026
i didn't recognize her
with her--i mean, she--

2316
01:51:05,059 --> 01:51:06,794
well, how are
the, uh, french lessons coming?

2317
01:51:06,828 --> 01:51:10,364
- [sobbing]

2318
01:51:12,934 --> 01:51:15,737
- and this is her mother, dad--
madame clebert.

2319
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:20,107
- yes, bonjour.

2320
01:51:20,141 --> 01:51:22,143
- your son, monsieur,
will inform you

2321
01:51:22,176 --> 01:51:24,178
that we are here
on a mission.

2322
01:51:24,211 --> 01:51:27,048
- oh?
what mission is that?

2323
01:51:27,081 --> 01:51:29,917
- dad, i--

2324
01:51:29,951 --> 01:51:31,052
- very well, monsieur.

2325
01:51:31,085 --> 01:51:33,921
then it is my duty to speak.

2326
01:51:33,955 --> 01:51:35,289
it cannot be done.

2327
01:51:35,322 --> 01:51:38,760
the rich american cannot do
this thing.

2328
01:51:38,793 --> 01:51:42,129
- what can he not do?

2329
01:51:42,163 --> 01:51:45,199
- it may seem nothing
in your country, monsieur.

2330
01:51:45,232 --> 01:51:47,735
but you will find
it is a costly business here.

2331
01:51:47,769 --> 01:51:49,937
- but what is?

2332
01:51:49,971 --> 01:51:51,272
- ah...
[chuckles]

2333
01:51:51,305 --> 01:51:53,074
he smiles.

2334
01:51:53,107 --> 01:51:55,409
he makes american joke.

2335
01:51:55,442 --> 01:51:59,280
it is not amusing, monsieur,
you will find.

2336
01:51:59,313 --> 01:52:02,449
the police take interest
in protecting the virtue

2337
01:52:02,483 --> 01:52:04,051
of my daughter.
- pop, i--

2338
01:52:04,085 --> 01:52:05,787
- would you shut up,
rich american?

2339
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:06,788
- believe me, dad,
i didn't--

2340
01:52:06,821 --> 01:52:09,290
- will you pipe down, please?

2341
01:52:09,323 --> 01:52:11,158
go on, madame.

2342
01:52:11,192 --> 01:52:14,195
- [speaking french]

2343
01:52:17,098 --> 01:52:19,466
if you wish the scandal,

2344
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,436
you may have the scandal.

2345
01:52:22,469 --> 01:52:26,808
but you wish to close the matter
without a scandal,

2346
01:52:26,841 --> 01:52:30,945
we can do so with quickness.

2347
01:52:30,978 --> 01:52:33,815
- i see.

2348
01:52:33,848 --> 01:52:37,184
madame, uh, how can we possibly
compensate you

2349
01:52:37,218 --> 01:52:41,789
for the virtue
of your daughter?

2350
01:52:41,823 --> 01:52:43,457
- dad, if i could just
say something--

2351
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:45,860
- how much, madame?

2352
01:52:45,893 --> 01:52:47,328
- monsieur comprend, yes.

2353
01:52:47,361 --> 01:52:50,264
he does not go wild
in the eye.

2354
01:52:50,297 --> 01:52:54,035
oh, monsieur--
intelligent man.

2355
01:52:54,068 --> 01:52:56,303
- thank you.

2356
01:52:56,337 --> 01:52:58,906
how much?

2357
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:01,208
- out of the wisdom
of his understanding,

2358
01:53:01,242 --> 01:53:03,444
which i see demonstration,

2359
01:53:03,477 --> 01:53:06,280
my daughter and myself

2360
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:11,185
leave this matter in the hand
of the so intelligent...

2361
01:53:11,218 --> 01:53:13,087
[speaking french]

2362
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,288
monsieur.

2363
01:53:14,321 --> 01:53:17,591
- oh, well, fine.

2364
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:19,326
because strangely enough,
i feel there's going to be

2365
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,164
a happy ending
for both florelle and my son.

2366
01:53:23,197 --> 01:53:24,165
- monsieur?

2367
01:53:24,198 --> 01:53:26,567
- sit down, elliott.

2368
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:29,937
madame, you have made me
a very happy man.

2369
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:32,073
my son will marry
your daughter.

2370
01:53:32,106 --> 01:53:35,042
- marry?

2371
01:53:35,076 --> 01:53:36,243
- hey, pop!
- you shut your yap.

2372
01:53:36,277 --> 01:53:39,146
that's the way we do things
back in terre haute, madame.

2373
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,547
you know, for a while there,
i was afraid

2374
01:53:40,581 --> 01:53:42,583
we'd never find a wife
for this boy.

2375
01:53:42,616 --> 01:53:46,387
but your lovely daughter is
an answer to a father's prayer.

2376
01:53:47,955 --> 01:53:52,093
- oh, monsieur makes the jokes.
[laughs]

2377
01:53:52,126 --> 01:53:54,228
- no, monsieur does not
make the joke.

2378
01:53:54,261 --> 01:53:56,964
sit down, madame.
take a load off your feet.

2379
01:53:56,998 --> 01:53:58,432
my wife should be
here any minute.

2380
01:53:58,465 --> 01:54:00,067
as long as you're going to be
in the family,

2381
01:54:00,101 --> 01:54:01,936
you might as well
meet us all, huh?

2382
01:54:01,969 --> 01:54:04,271
- mama, he speaks
of the marriage?

2383
01:54:04,305 --> 01:54:07,942
- yes, that's what
he speaks of.

2384
01:54:07,975 --> 01:54:09,610
- monsieur is...

2385
01:54:09,643 --> 01:54:13,147
how you say, comical man?

2386
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,182
hmm?
[laughs]

2387
01:54:15,216 --> 01:54:17,084
monsieur makes the jokes.

2388
01:54:17,118 --> 01:54:21,088
- [chuckles nervously]

2389
01:54:21,122 --> 01:54:22,589
- no, he does not
make the joke.

2390
01:54:22,623 --> 01:54:24,225
monsieur is very serious.

2391
01:54:24,258 --> 01:54:25,559
- pop, i hate
to interrupt you--

2392
01:54:25,592 --> 01:54:27,194
- well, then don't.

2393
01:54:27,228 --> 01:54:28,095
now, let's see, madame.

2394
01:54:28,129 --> 01:54:32,066
how old did you say
your daughter was?

2395
01:54:32,099 --> 01:54:34,235
well, she's not as young
as she looks, is she?

2396
01:54:34,268 --> 01:54:36,370
but that's all right,
as long as she's a good worker.

2397
01:54:36,403 --> 01:54:38,239
is she strong?
- strong?

2398
01:54:38,272 --> 01:54:39,173
- yes, for the farm.

2399
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:40,507
she's going to have to work
on the farm.

2400
01:54:40,541 --> 01:54:42,176
- farm?
- oh, yes, yes.

2401
01:54:42,209 --> 01:54:44,211
you see, madame, you've got
the wrong idea about americans.

2402
01:54:44,245 --> 01:54:45,679
they're not all rich,
you know?

2403
01:54:45,712 --> 01:54:48,049
now you take us--we've just got
this little rocky old farm

2404
01:54:48,082 --> 01:54:49,283
back in indiana.

2405
01:54:49,316 --> 01:54:51,953
now, of course, on our farm,
the women do most of the work.

2406
01:54:51,986 --> 01:54:54,188
like, my wife and daughter work
from way before sunup

2407
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:55,456
to way after sundown.

2408
01:54:55,489 --> 01:54:58,092
we can sure use another hand.
now, how is florelle with cows?

2409
01:54:58,125 --> 01:55:00,294
- cows?

2410
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:01,963
- well, how about sheep, then?

2411
01:55:01,996 --> 01:55:03,330
- sheep?
[speaking french]

2412
01:55:03,364 --> 01:55:05,967
we just escaped the sheep.

2413
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,102
that is why we left normandy,
to escape the sheep.

2414
01:55:08,135 --> 01:55:10,704
- oh, well, that just shows you
how life goes round and round,

2415
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:12,106
doesn't it?

2416
01:55:12,139 --> 01:55:13,474
i'll tell you--
maybe we'll just put her

2417
01:55:13,507 --> 01:55:15,076
in charge of slopping
the hogs, huh?

2418
01:55:15,109 --> 01:55:16,177
- mama.

2419
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:17,611
- i think this whole
happy occasion

2420
01:55:17,644 --> 01:55:19,080
calls for a celebration,
madame, huh?

2421
01:55:19,113 --> 01:55:20,514
come on, now,
we'll have some champagne.

2422
01:55:20,547 --> 01:55:22,716
come right along.

2423
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:25,219
this is the way we open it
out in the wild west.

2424
01:55:25,252 --> 01:55:27,221
i hope this is a good year.

2425
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:29,056
i know how fussy you french are
about your champagne.

2426
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:30,724
- oh, monsieur.
- i beg your pardon.

2427
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:32,093
- [speaking french]

2428
01:55:32,126 --> 01:55:33,094
- well, fou to you
too, madame.

2429
01:55:33,127 --> 01:55:34,095
- [speaking french]

2430
01:55:34,128 --> 01:55:37,464
- oh, don't leave.
the party's just started.

2431
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:46,107
- you know, i got to hand it
to you, pop.

2432
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:47,708
she really thought
you were fou.

2433
01:55:47,741 --> 01:55:48,775
you know what fou is?

2434
01:55:48,809 --> 01:55:51,245
fou is the french word
for crazy, pop.

2435
01:55:51,278 --> 01:55:52,980
- elliott--
- no, pop!

2436
01:55:53,014 --> 01:55:54,515
no!

2437
01:56:15,369 --> 01:56:17,171
- hello, darling.
- oh, hi, katie.

2438
01:56:17,204 --> 01:56:18,372
- did you have a nice day?

2439
01:56:18,405 --> 01:56:19,773
- oh, just routine.

2440
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:21,208
- oh, harry, i'm so excited.
this is our night,

2441
01:56:21,242 --> 01:56:22,476
just the two of us--

2442
01:56:22,509 --> 01:56:24,645
absolutely no children.

2443
01:56:24,678 --> 01:56:27,448
harry, it's going to be
the most perfect evening....

2444
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:31,052
without one jarring note
to spoil it, not one.

2445
01:56:31,085 --> 01:56:33,287
- katie, i, uh--

2446
01:56:36,357 --> 01:56:39,126
- and that includes rudolph
and his stupid flowers.

2447
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:41,428
- but those were--

2448
01:56:44,231 --> 01:56:46,233
my flowers.

2449
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:50,337
[indistinct chatter]

2450
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:19,433
well...

2451
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:25,539
- harry, i meant what i said.

2452
01:57:25,572 --> 01:57:27,108
i want this to be
a wonderful evening,

2453
01:57:27,141 --> 01:57:29,076
and if you do
one single thing to spoil it...

2454
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:31,145
- i'm not going
to spoil anything.

2455
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:45,192
hey, you're winning.

2456
01:57:45,226 --> 01:57:47,128
- yes, how'd you do?
- i lost it all.

2457
01:57:47,161 --> 01:57:48,262
- oh, here.

2458
01:57:48,295 --> 01:57:50,264
- oh, thank you, i'll give you
an i.o.u. later, okay?

2459
01:57:50,297 --> 01:57:52,566
i think i'll try a little
chemin de fer.

2460
01:58:45,452 --> 01:58:49,456
- ah, the husband, as usual.

2461
01:58:52,226 --> 01:58:55,796
i wouldn't try anything violent
if i were you, mr. willard.

2462
01:58:55,829 --> 01:58:58,165
i'm a master of karate.

2463
01:59:01,502 --> 01:59:03,537
[all screaming]

2464
01:59:30,731 --> 01:59:32,699
- i can find my own way out.

2465
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:40,674
well, out the back door, huh?

2466
01:59:40,707 --> 01:59:43,410
well, thanks
very much, fellows.

2467
01:59:43,444 --> 01:59:45,346
well, good evening.

2468
01:59:45,379 --> 01:59:47,748
tell me, do either
of you fellows speak english?

2469
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:49,250
i mean, uh--

2470
01:59:49,283 --> 01:59:52,519
well, you don't.

2471
01:59:52,553 --> 01:59:53,954
you know, i don't believe
i've ever been

2472
01:59:53,987 --> 01:59:55,689
in this part
of town before.

2473
01:59:55,722 --> 01:59:58,559
it's awfully nice of you
to show me around like this.

2474
01:59:58,592 --> 02:00:00,761
you shouldn't go
to all this trouble.

2475
02:00:00,794 --> 02:00:03,597
my, this is certainly
a wonderful place, isn't it?

2476
02:00:09,603 --> 02:00:11,238
oh, i'll tell you.
well--

2477
02:00:11,272 --> 02:00:14,308
well, you could just drop me
anyplace along here, fellows.

2478
02:00:14,341 --> 02:00:16,377
after all, this is--
thanks very much, fellows.

2479
02:00:16,410 --> 02:00:18,579
well, wait a minute.

2480
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:33,994
- [speaking french]

2481
02:00:39,333 --> 02:00:41,302
it's all right, mr. willard.
he said you could come with me.

2482
02:00:41,335 --> 02:00:43,270
- well, thanks.

2483
02:00:43,304 --> 02:00:44,971
- they, uh, don't like
unfavorable publicity

2484
02:00:45,005 --> 02:00:47,974
at the casino, so they turn
undesirable characters

2485
02:00:48,008 --> 02:00:49,443
over to the french police
this way.

2486
02:00:49,476 --> 02:00:50,544
- how do you mean?

2487
02:00:50,577 --> 02:00:53,580
well, that little cafe there
is smack on the border.

2488
02:00:53,614 --> 02:00:56,650
the front door's in monaco,
and the back door's right here

2489
02:00:56,683 --> 02:00:58,051
on the border of france.
it's done all the time.

2490
02:00:58,084 --> 02:00:59,620
- yeah.

2491
02:00:59,653 --> 02:01:00,954
well, i've got to let
my wife know

2492
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:01,888
what happened
to me some way.

2493
02:01:01,922 --> 02:01:04,958
- i sent her back
to the hotel in a taxi.

2494
02:01:04,991 --> 02:01:06,960
- well, i appreciate that.

2495
02:01:06,993 --> 02:01:10,030
i'm sorry to have caused
you so much trouble.

2496
02:01:10,063 --> 02:01:13,467
- hop in. i'll drive you back
to the hotel.

2497
02:01:24,411 --> 02:01:26,913
i got a few questions
i'd like to ask you, sir.

2498
02:01:26,947 --> 02:01:28,849
- all right, nick.

2499
02:01:28,882 --> 02:01:32,453
maybe there are a couple
i'd like to ask you too.

2500
02:01:32,486 --> 02:01:33,654
- why'd you sock him?

2501
02:01:33,687 --> 02:01:34,988
- [chuckles]
that's easy.

2502
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:36,990
he had it coming.

2503
02:01:37,023 --> 02:01:38,659
- you did it because
you're in love with your wife,

2504
02:01:38,692 --> 02:01:39,660
didn't you?

2505
02:01:39,693 --> 02:01:42,028
- yeah.

2506
02:01:42,062 --> 02:01:43,530
- how long you been married?

2507
02:01:43,564 --> 02:01:45,566
- 22 years.

2508
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:46,967
- honest...

2509
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,403
22 years.

2510
02:01:49,436 --> 02:01:52,706
the same woman--
you're in love with her.

2511
02:01:52,739 --> 02:01:54,441
i mean, you don't just love her,
not just that.

2512
02:01:54,475 --> 02:01:55,909
you are in love with her.

2513
02:01:55,942 --> 02:01:56,977
- that's right.

2514
02:01:57,010 --> 02:01:58,845
- that's why
you socked him, huh?

2515
02:01:58,879 --> 02:02:01,648
- sure.
and i'd do it again.

2516
02:02:01,682 --> 02:02:03,116
you want to turn around
and go back, i'll show you.

2517
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:07,854
- [chuckles]

2518
02:02:07,888 --> 02:02:10,090
- can i ask you a question now?

2519
02:02:10,123 --> 02:02:11,858
- shoot.

2520
02:02:11,892 --> 02:02:14,060
- tell me...

2521
02:02:14,094 --> 02:02:16,129
what's going on
between you and amy?

2522
02:02:16,162 --> 02:02:17,731
i'm not going to give you
that business

2523
02:02:17,764 --> 02:02:20,901
about "a father has a right,"
but i'd like to know.

2524
02:02:20,934 --> 02:02:22,569
- i don't know if i can.

2525
02:02:22,603 --> 02:02:23,570
- try.

2526
02:02:23,604 --> 02:02:26,440
- well, it goes
a long way back.

2527
02:02:26,473 --> 02:02:30,043
i'm just getting it
straight myself.

2528
02:02:30,076 --> 02:02:32,679
you see, i never met anyone
like you before,

2529
02:02:32,713 --> 02:02:35,816
like amy either.

2530
02:02:35,849 --> 02:02:39,085
when she left paris,
my world fell apart.

2531
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:41,588
i began to think i was
really in love, mr. willard,

2532
02:02:41,622 --> 02:02:44,825
i mean, really in love.

2533
02:02:44,858 --> 02:02:46,427
but i knew that was
a phony idea.

2534
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,528
at least that's what
i kept telling myself,

2535
02:02:47,561 --> 02:02:49,129
'cause i knew better.

2536
02:02:49,162 --> 02:02:51,064
you follow me?

2537
02:02:51,097 --> 02:02:52,466
- go on.

2538
02:02:52,499 --> 02:02:54,701
- well, i followed amy
down from paris.

2539
02:02:54,735 --> 02:02:56,069
and you saw
what was happening.

2540
02:02:56,102 --> 02:02:58,004
she bought that
stupid bathing suit

2541
02:02:58,038 --> 02:03:01,074
'cause she thought it made her
into the kind of girl i wanted.

2542
02:03:01,107 --> 02:03:03,076
i don't know what came over me.

2543
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:04,144
got her out in that boat.

2544
02:03:04,177 --> 02:03:06,647
i told her she was nothing
but a poor little hick,

2545
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:08,715
that you were all hicks,
who didn't know

2546
02:03:08,749 --> 02:03:10,551
the first thing about realities,
that you were all

2547
02:03:10,584 --> 02:03:11,985
ruining her life, and she
could choose right then

2548
02:03:12,018 --> 02:03:14,187
between you and me.

2549
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:16,590
you saw what happened then.

2550
02:03:31,772 --> 02:03:34,875
i'm the world's worst,
mr. willard.

2551
02:03:34,908 --> 02:03:36,677
you had me pegged
from the very beginning,

2552
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:38,479
didn't you?

2553
02:03:38,512 --> 02:03:39,713
- well, i--

2554
02:03:39,746 --> 02:03:41,147
- after 22 years,
you're still in love

2555
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:43,049
with your wife, aren't you?

2556
02:03:45,218 --> 02:03:47,954
i wouldn't have believed
that was possible.

2557
02:03:47,988 --> 02:03:51,858
- nick, why don't you come in
and talk to amy?

2558
02:03:55,762 --> 02:04:00,066
anything you want me
to tell her?

2559
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:02,736
- no.

2560
02:04:02,769 --> 02:04:04,671
i'm, uh, going
back to new york.

2561
02:04:04,705 --> 02:04:07,007
i'm going to take
that lousy job.

2562
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,877
who knows? maybe i can make
something out of myself.

2563
02:04:22,923 --> 02:04:24,024
- good-bye, nick.

2564
02:04:24,057 --> 02:04:27,561
- take care of amy,
mr. willard.

2565
02:04:27,594 --> 02:04:29,863
see that she's, uh...

2566
02:04:29,896 --> 02:04:32,599
well, you know,
just take care of her, huh?

2567
02:04:32,633 --> 02:04:34,000
- i will, nick.

2568
02:04:37,237 --> 02:04:40,607
- why couldn't i have had
an old man like you?

2569
02:04:52,118 --> 02:04:53,820
- daddy?

2570
02:04:53,854 --> 02:04:54,888
are you all right?

2571
02:04:54,921 --> 02:04:56,590
we've been so worried
about you.

2572
02:04:56,623 --> 02:04:57,991
- oh, yeah, i'm all right.

2573
02:04:58,024 --> 02:05:01,995
didn't you see who that was?

2574
02:05:02,028 --> 02:05:04,030
he said he was going
to new york.

2575
02:05:04,064 --> 02:05:07,133
he said something
about taking that lousy job.

2576
02:05:07,167 --> 02:05:10,571
- well,
for goodness sakes, daddy,

2577
02:05:10,604 --> 02:05:14,140
stop looking at me like that.

2578
02:05:14,174 --> 02:05:16,710
- well, doesn't that mean
anything to you?

2579
02:05:16,743 --> 02:05:19,546
- oh, of course it does.

2580
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:23,950
well, what do you expect
me to do, fall apart?

2581
02:05:23,984 --> 02:05:27,020
give yourself
a little credit, daddy.

2582
02:05:27,053 --> 02:05:31,992
you raised a girl
with some gumption.

2583
02:05:32,025 --> 02:05:35,128
- well, amy, i--
- hey, pop!

2584
02:05:35,161 --> 02:05:37,163
we heard about
the big rhubarb--wham!

2585
02:05:37,197 --> 02:05:38,164
- is it true, dad?

2586
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:40,000
they said you practically
wrecked the casino

2587
02:05:40,033 --> 02:05:41,902
with one punch.
- yeah!

2588
02:05:41,935 --> 02:05:45,606
- well, not the whole casino,
but never mind that.

2589
02:05:45,639 --> 02:05:47,007
do you know
where you mother is?

2590
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:48,809
- she's over there.

2591
02:05:53,647 --> 02:05:55,916
- i think i'm in trouble.

2592
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:58,752
- oh, uh, amy?

2593
02:05:58,785 --> 02:06:00,587
- oh, don't worry
about me, pop.

2594
02:06:00,621 --> 02:06:02,989
i'm going out
with my two brothers tonight.

2595
02:06:03,023 --> 02:06:04,891
you take care
of your own problems.

2596
02:06:04,925 --> 02:06:07,761
- okay.

2597
02:06:07,794 --> 02:06:10,030
well...

2598
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:21,274
i'm sorry, katie.
- sorry?

2599
02:06:21,307 --> 02:06:23,644
- i didn't mean
to spoil your evening.

2600
02:06:23,677 --> 02:06:24,911
- spoil it?

2601
02:06:24,945 --> 02:06:26,880
it's still by all odds,
on all counts

2602
02:06:26,913 --> 02:06:29,115
the most perfect evening
of my life.

2603
02:06:29,149 --> 02:06:30,884
- really, katie?

2604
02:06:30,917 --> 02:06:33,086
- [speaking french]

2605
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:34,888
- oh, oui, indeed.

2606
02:06:34,921 --> 02:06:36,289
- i wouldn't want it
to get around terre haute,

2607
02:06:36,322 --> 02:06:38,158
but my favorite memory
will always be

2608
02:06:38,191 --> 02:06:39,893
the expression
on rudolph's face

2609
02:06:39,926 --> 02:06:41,294
as he lay amongst
the shattered ruins

2610
02:06:41,327 --> 02:06:44,097
of the roulette table.
[both laughing]

2611
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:46,366
- [speaking french]

2612
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:49,302
- oh, that's me in there.
well, i'll drink to that.

2613
02:06:49,335 --> 02:06:50,904
- bottoms up.

02:07:23,469 --> 02:07:25,906
- thank you, madame.

2627
02:07:25,939 --> 02:07:27,407

02:07:46,492 --> 02:07:47,928
- of course, madame.

2633
02:07:47,961 --> 02:07:50,196
they are celebrating
in the square nearby.

2634
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:52,065
- without us?

2642
02:08:07,047 --> 02:08:09,182
katie?
