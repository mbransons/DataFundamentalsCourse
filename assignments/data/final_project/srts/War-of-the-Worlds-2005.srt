1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're human.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,560
Please, just let me go.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,080
Given the extent of their
physical degeneration,

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,440
we think that you'll
encounter minimal resistance.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
That's my sister.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,200
It's a
trap. We're under attack.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,760
They must've cured themselves.

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
He's one of them.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
I'm looking for someone.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,120
Professor Bill Ward.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,640
You've been
gone for months.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,400
What did they do to you?

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,120
You have to kill him.

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Mmm...

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,520
He's creating a virus
that will slaughter our people.

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,640
You will die with us.

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,240
You can stop it from happening.

18
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,960
How?

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,720
You have to kill him.

20
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,200
Em, what's wrong?

21
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,560
I can feel them.

22
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,120
What do you mean?

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,400
I can feel them.

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,920
I feel their pain.

25
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,760
It's okay.

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
You're safe now.

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,320
None of us are safe.

28
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,736
How long
have you been sitting with him?

29
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,360
Most of the night.

30
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,520
Has he said anything?

31
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,680
I gave him the antibiotics.

32
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
The equations in his notepad.
I think they're important.

33
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,880
More important than

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
the lives of the people here?

35
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Hmm?

36
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Sophia?

37
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,601
This will terminate the
pregnancy in the first ten weeks.

38
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Okay.

39
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,040
Have you told Nathan?

40
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,160
No. It's better
if he never knows.

41
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,360
If there's anything
else you need.

42
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Thank you.

43
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
They'll never know
they were human.

44
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,040
It's better this way.

45
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
If they knew,

46
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,480
they'd grow up to hate us.

47
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,320
Like we grew up to hate them?

48
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
We lost some more of our people.

49
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,280
- How many?
- Six.

50
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,680
We cure ourselves so we
can die fighting them?

51
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,240
We have no choice.

52
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,240
We kill them, they kill us.

53
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,400
Sometimes I think
it will never end.

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,080
It's different this time.

55
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,040
Emily knows what
she's got to do.

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are you doing?

57
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,840
I... I was looking
for your mother.

58
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Right.

59
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
Water.

60
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Water.

61
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Please.

62
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,680
Thank you.

63
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,840
The equations...

64
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,600
What are they?

65
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,800
They're formulas.

66
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,840
To measure the collapse
of the matter waves.

67
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,320
This matter wave...

68
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,800
Is it what we call
wave particle duality?

69
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
It's all around us.

70
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
It's...

71
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,200
It's only when we see them,

72
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,360
that we call them
objects or things.

73
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,520
Only then are they
part of space and time.

74
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,840
We know of these collapses.

75
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
We only partially
understand them.

76
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,840
It took us hundreds of years.

77
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,040
Even now,

78
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,920
transposing the matter
waves is dangerous.

79
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,640
You can control them?

80
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,760
Can you move objects
through space and time?

81
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Yes.

82
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,680
We detected ripples
in interstellar space,

83
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,200
close to the edge
of our solar system.

84
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,880
Do you know what they were?

85
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
They are the echoes

86
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,680
of our transposition,

87
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,280
our journey to Earth.

88
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,680
But you came to Earth
more than six months ago.

89
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,920
Why are we only detecting
these ripples now?

90
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,680
The echoes travel

91
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,480
at the speed of light.

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
It took them longer to get here.

93
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,200
Longer than you?

94
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,640
Our journey took no time at all.

95
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Hey.

96
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
You said you wanted
to change things?

97
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
It's not too late.

98
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,760
What do you mean?

99
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,320
How? How can you change it?

100
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,256
You walk along the river
and you join the other section here.

101
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
He regained consciousness.

102
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Leave us.

103
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,960
Did he say anything?

104
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,600
He said their journey to
Earth took no time at all.

105
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,680
How is that possible?

106
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
In the quantum world, photons and
electrons can affect each other

107
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,240
even if they're
hundreds of miles apart.

108
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,880
It happens in an instant.

109
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,480
There's no travel, no
communication, no time passes.

110
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,360
Can they use this?

111
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,640
I think they can move objects
instantaneously across vast distances.

112
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,880
I think it's how they got here.

113
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,800
Catherine, how does it help us?

114
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,920
I don't know.

115
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,760
I don't know.

116
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,920
He said we could change things.

117
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,720
That it wasn't too late.

118
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,896
If you can manipulate the
world on a quantum level,

119
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,200
then maybe anything is possible.

120
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,560
Yeah, maybe.

121
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,120
I know I shouldn't have
given him the antibiotics.

122
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,280
All I could think about
was getting answers.

123
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,960
That was more important
to me than anything.

124
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,400
How can you love someone
who thinks like that?

125
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,840
It's not easy.

126
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,640
All I can tell you is that I do.

127
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Em?

128
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,536
How're you doing?

129
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
I'm okay.

130
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Mum has to stop herself from
crying every time she looks at me.

131
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,360
She was in pieces when
you didn't come back.

132
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,680
We thought you were dead.

133
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,400
Maybe you should
go and find Mum.

134
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,440
You're angry with me for
using the antibiotics.

135
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,920
When someone else needs them, you can
explain why you chose to save him.

136
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,000
And then you can watch them die.

137
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,040
There's someone out there.

138
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,120
I asked for volunteers to clear the
snow from around the service panels.

139
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,080
Oh, no.
Check the generator.

140
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Stay away
from the windows!

141
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
What's happening?

142
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,656
Stay away
from the windows!

143
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,200
Theo!
-  Catherine, down!

144
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,760
- Theo?
-  Get down, Sophia!

145
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Theo!

146
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,000
Sophia, get down!
- Theo!

147
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,520
Theo?

148
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,320
Sophia!

149
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,880
Emily, get down!

150
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,400
Theo?

151
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,320
- Theo?
No!

152
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,040
- No!

153
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
No!

154
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Theo!

155
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,760
Sophia, get up!

156
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,640
There's nothing you can do! Leave
him! You have to leave him! Let's go!

157
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,040
Quickly!

158
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,480
Quickly!

159
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,560
Nathan.

160
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Nathan!

161
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,720
Let's go!

162
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,040
Catherine!

163
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Got it!

164
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,320
The service tunnel! Go!

165
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,480
Come on, Sophia! Go!

166
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Go, go, go!

167
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,480
Where's Theo?

168
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
He's dead.

169
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,040
Get out of here.

170
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,160
Get out!

171
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,120
Come on!

172
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,520
Come on!

173
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,960
No!

174
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
Take them away.

175
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,040
Take them away.

176
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,840
Come on.

177
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,600
Micah?

178
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,960
Why did
you have to do this?

179
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,480
There has to be

180
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,680
another way.

181
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,200
There is no other way.

182
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,880
It's us or them.

183
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,920
It doesn't have to be like this.

184
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,080
Did you tell them
why you came here?

185
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,440
They should know that it
doesn't have to be like this.

186
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,400
Where is the notebook?

187
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,040
You cannot kill an idea.

188
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,560
They won't ever understand it.

189
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,960
Your ideas will die with you.

190
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
You can kill your own brother?

191
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,120
We cannot allow you to live.

192
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Please...

193
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,240
Don't get old.

194
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,480
I think the chances of
that are extremely slim.

195
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,440
My boyfriend was
in the wine trade.

196
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Yeah?

197
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
What happened to him?

198
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,080
He died.

199
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,040
In the attack?

200
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
After.

201
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,920
I tested Emily's DNA.

202
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,160
- She let you?
- I took a hair from her hairbrush.

203
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,480
She shares some of
the same mutations

204
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,720
as the aliens.

205
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,600
She... She's alien?

206
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,720
- It's incredible.

207
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,640
Her DNA is almost identical.

208
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,880
The chances of that are...
are billions to one.

209
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,080
How is that even possible?

210
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,240
I don't know.

211
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,080
It doesn't make any sense.

212
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,000
None of it makes any sense.

213
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,040
Well, you said that if
you had a live alien,

214
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,800
you could start
testing the virus.

215
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,800
Seems to me like you've got one.

216
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,840
You want me to test it on Emily?

217
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Could you?

218
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,960
You're asking me to...
to deliberately infect her?

219
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,320
What would it do to her?

220
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,160
Well, I'm developing
RNA interferers

221
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,680
that shut down the genes
that cause insulin.

222
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,080
She would fall into a diabetic
coma and she would die.

223
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,960
Well, maybe that's a
price worth paying.

224
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,160
I'm not gonna do it.

225
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,680
How could I experiment
on a 17-year-old girl?

226
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,840
She's a child.

227
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,960
This is it.

228
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,560
This is what the end
of humanity looks like.

229
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Drink up.

230
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,080
Hello, Tom.
- Hey.

231
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,840
Couldn't sleep.

232
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Hmm.

233
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,880
Who can these days?

234
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,000
I
think they've gone.

235
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,360
You think it's weird
that they look like us?

236
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
What?

237
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Nothing.

238
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,640
Pack up your things.

239
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,280
We're leaving.

240
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Chloe?

241
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You okay?

242
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,320
The tremor in Sacha's hand...

243
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,600
It's come back.

244
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,896
You can't be sure what it is. I
mean, maybe he's just tired...

245
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,120
No, no, no. It's the
muscular dystrophy.

246
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,160
And it's getting worse.

247
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Like his father.

248
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,400
I can't bear it.

249
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,720
Come here.

250
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Hey.

251
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,160
How are you feeling?

252
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,240
Everyone keeps asking
me that.

253
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,640
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to say.

254
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,320
You can sit down.

255
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
Mmm, maybe don't
wanna get too close.

256
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,840
What do you mean?

257
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,200
Everyone thinks I'm one of them.

258
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,840
I don't think that.

259
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
So...

260
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,600
What's been going on with
you these last few months?

261
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,280
- Any good parties?

262
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
No.

263
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,520
- No good parties.

264
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,000
Met any nice girls?

265
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,240
You're seeing someone?

266
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,040
I thought you were dead.

267
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,720
Kariem, honestly, it's fine.

269
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
You're not jealous?

270
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,400
Well, is... Is she
prettier than me?

271
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
No, I...

272
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
You're joking.

273
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,360
What happened to
you on that ship?

274
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,640
I know something is wrong.

275
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,600
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

276
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Please.

277
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,520
I want to help you.

278
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,920
Sometimes,

279
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,840
it feels like they're
inside my head.

280
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,360
I keep having these... thoughts.

281
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,720
I'm so scared.

282
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,920
Maybe you should talk to Bill.

283
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,480
No.

284
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,480
No.

285
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,560
No, I don't think I should.

286
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,200
I'll check upstairs.

287
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,440
We just leave him up
there? We don't bury him?

288
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,600
It's too dangerous to go back.

289
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,240
If he was here he'd
tell us not to go.

290
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,240
I'm sorry.

291
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,600
I'll see if I can find
some wood for a fire.

292
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,200
I promised Theo I'd protect him.

293
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,920
I told him I'd keep him safe...

294
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,120
Sophia. Sophia.

295
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,040
It's not your fault, okay?

296
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,440
There's nothing you
could have done.

297
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,256
Get down! Get down!

298
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,760
Don't shoot! Don't
shoot! Don't shoot!

299
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Check them.

300
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,680
Show me your wrists.

301
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,280
Your wrists, let me see 'em.

302
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Take your bag off.

303
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,880
I'm looking
for my family.

304
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,520
Do you know them?

305
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,360
No. No way.

306
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,000
Tom and Emily's dad?

307
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,960
Are they still alive?

308
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,080
Yeah. Yeah, they're here.
They're here. They're inside.

309
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Sarah?

310
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,920
Mate, she's with them.

311
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,080
Are... Are you sure?

312
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,280
You're sure... You're
sure that that's them?

313
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,800
Mate, I'm 100%. I've been
with them since the start.

314
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,200
Happy days.

315
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Sarah.

316
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh, my God.

317
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,600
You're alive.

318
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Oh...

319
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Hi.

320
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,360
Hi.

321
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh, Jesus.

322
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,480
It's so good to see you.

323
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,960
The kids?

324
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,960
They're here. They're fine.

325
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,800
We're okay.

326
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Dad?

327
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,640
Tom.

328
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
Hey, buddy.

329
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,720
I thought you were dead.

330
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
No.

331
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,880
I never stopped looking for you.

332
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,200
- Same hair.

333
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Em.

334
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,320
It's me. It's your dad.

335
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,760
I know.

336
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,920
I can see you.

337
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,800
You can
help me if you like?

338
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,160
What's going to happen now
Jonathan has his family?

339
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,840
What do you mean?

340
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,200
Will he get back with his wife?

341
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,320
I don't know.

342
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,200
Let's just be grateful
that he's found them.

343
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,560
Everything will change now.

344
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,720
Mom's
telling him about me.

345
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,200
It's okay.

346
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,080
I know you think
I'm one of them.

347
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Are you?

348
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,120
No.

349
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
What is it?

350
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,040
It's Micah.

351
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
He's dead.

352
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
How?

353
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,600
He died fighting for our people.

354
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm truly sorry.

355
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,080
Jokim will bring his
body here for burial.

356
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,000
Was Jokim there when Micah died?

357
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,000
Yes.

358
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,760
He did everything he could.

359
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,720
He couldn't save him.

360
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Sarah.

361
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Chloe?

362
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
This is, erm...

363
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
This is Chloe.

364
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
We, erm, travelled
through France together.

365
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Hi.

366
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Hi.

367
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,000
This is Tom, Emily. My kids.

368
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,640
Your dad talked to me about you.

369
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,080
It's nice to finally meet you.

370
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,520
Thank you for
looking after him.

371
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,320
I'm glad he found you.

372
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,280
If you need anything,

373
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,760
anything at all...

374
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,880
Yeah, thank you.

375
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,960
Uh, this is my son, Sacha.

376
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Hi.

377
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,080
We'll, uh,
let you settle in.

378
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
- I'll show you where we're sleeping.
- Yeah.

379
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
What?

380
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,296
I want the water,
and I'll take your bag, too.

381
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Thank you.

382
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Nothing.

383
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,520
We'll have to
squeeze in another mattress.

384
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,120
- Sarah...
- I don't want Emily sleeping on her own.

385
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,736
Not after everything
she's been through.

386
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,960
So she's in with us for now.

387
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Sarah...

388
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,520
I'm with Chloe.

389
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,640
We didn't mean for it to happen.

390
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm sorry.

391
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Oh...

392
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,600
Oh, you thought
I was dead, so...

393
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,720
She's very pretty.

394
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
How old is she?

395
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Sorry.

396
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,640
Everything was so
fucked up. I thought...

397
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,160
I thought I lost
you and the kids.

398
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,000
I was going under, I
was a mess. We just...

399
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,160
We needed each other.

400
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,560
- I'm sorry.
- Don't.

401
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,520
Things weren't exactly
great between us.

402
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,920
I've hated myself for
that, every single day.

403
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,000
Just go.

404
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,080
This
is the building.

405
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,200
Right, go ahead.

406
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,360
I'll keep watch.

407
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,360
How do we find
this Professor Bill Ward?

408
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,856
We have to assume
he's some kind of scientist.

409
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,080
We'll start there.

410
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,560
Look at the reference pages.

411
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,960
What are they?

412
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,280
At the back of the book, they list
all the sources used for research.

413
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,520
I miss the internet.

414
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,040
He's creating a
virus that will slaughter our people.

415
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,880
You have to kill him.

416
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,200
Emily?

417
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,080
I won't let you kill them.

418
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,520
Emily.

419
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,880
What's going on?

420
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,800
Jonathan's daughter, Emily.
She tried to kill someone.

421
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,280
Hello, Tom.

422
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,240
I heard what Emily did.

423
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,200
Oh, no. I'm fine.

424
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,000
She tried to kill you.

425
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,040
Yeah.

426
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Everyone's saying
she's one of them.

427
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Is she?

428
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,360
Yes.

429
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,360
How can she be?

430
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,520
She's my sister.

431
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,960
None of it makes any sense.

432
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,960
I'm sorry, Tom.

433
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,040
What are they gonna do to her?

434
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
I don't know.

435
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,520
We don't have a choice.

436
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm sorry.

437
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,280
I didn't know what I was doing.

438
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,480
It's okay. It's okay.

439
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,360
Look, uh...

440
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,760
I'm gonna give you
something to, uh...

441
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,920
To help you sleep.

442
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Okay?

443
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
Okay.

444
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,360
What is it?

445
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,080
It's, erm... It's
just a mild sedative.

446
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,360
Okay.

447
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
I'm sorry.

448
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,560
It's okay.

449
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,920
Just... Just get
some sleep, okay?
