00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
In the previous section contents:

2
00:00:01,121 --> 00:00:04,132
- Already in the new waitress arrived? - Julio Espinosa, has just arrived.

3
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:06,725
- What the hell are you doing? - Finding my sister.

4
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:09,875
My sister is not left on their own feet. I think something happened to him.

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,356
Something happened that night and threaten to figure out.

6
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:14,235
Jimena was with you last time.

7
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,027
- What happened to him? - They were found dead this morning. They were stabbed.

8
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:19,427
I guess you're the detective ...

9
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:21,435
Detective Ayala, the Supervisory Body.

10
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:23,986
It appears this fiercely ... made of gold.

11
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:26,993
The only places where gold can knife.

12
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,891
Alicia's mother asked from her hand.

13
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:33,121
I could not right hands of my daughter's life. And the family business.

14
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:34,821
Anyone else in the family, my mother.

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,722
I will not let anyone come Vergara Markijan set aside.

16
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:40,269
You want to be a manager?

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,000
You get used to it, and be hard to take anything for victory.

18
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:47,447
I wish you would say a toast. Wedding.

19
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:51,169
Alicia Señorita another world, Julio. Beat in as much that will help you

20
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:53,647
find out what happened to your sister, and do not think about it any more.

21
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:54,871
I can not.

22
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:55,878
What are you doing here?

23
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,775
Are you afraid that your fiancee gets to know the real face?

24
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:01,256
- Can you feel? - The child already extends with.

25
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:04,401
I know that the child is not from me, but no one would like the way I'm going.

26
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:07,246
- Is there a problem? - One of the maid, Belénnel.

27
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:09,590
- What happened to him? - Pregnant.

28
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,837
What is it?

29
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,729
I will not let you ruin this kid put it in my life, you hear?

30
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,843
You need your help to stop Ángel. If not, we both fail.

31
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:21,737
Don Diego, as the hotel manager, believes you could use a helping hand.

32
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,284
You made a mistake, Belén.

33
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:28,881
Now that my vicinity or, in real life a living hell can I change.

34
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:34,364
Yesterday, when I weighed the helper himself, I noticed the tattoo on his arm.

35
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:37,033
This is typical of the prison.

36
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:40,068
- It was a minor theft. - You do not have to explain.

37
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:42,917
I know what you did and who you are, Julio Espinosa.

38
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:46,468
Or I should call him ... Julio Olmedónak?

39
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:48,645
I do not know whether you know my daughter, Eugenia.

40
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:50,590
And what can you do to this end?

41
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:52,972
Eugenia, my dear ...

42
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:54,777
We do not have to get married if you do not want.

43
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:56,234
But I want to Javier.

44
00:01:56,722 --> 00:02:00,509
My dear sister, Mercedes. Javier Alarcón, the groom.

45
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:03,474
Why was not you? Why do not you recognize you before?

46
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:06,216
Eugenia, no! Put it down, please.

47
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:07,439
Do not move!

GRAN HOTEL Part 5: Blood Red Moon

52
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:12,061
- Calm down! We can fix! - There's nothing to fix.

53
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:14,876
Eugenia! If you really love me, put the gun down.

54
00:03:15,883 --> 00:03:16,994
And you say nothing?

55
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,328
No, please, Eugenia.

56
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,651
- It was not his fault, it's mine. - Do not come near!

57
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:24,822
Eugenia. Eugenia, listen to me. That does not mean anything. I love you.

58
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:29,266
- You're lying. - No, Eugenia.

59
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:31,283
- I love you. - You're lying.

60
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,851
No no. Only I truly love.

61
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,084
Eugenia, please.

62
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:37,984
I love you.

63
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,098
Eugenia, please.

64
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:46,043
Javier! Javier! Javier!

65
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:50,070
- Kérlek! Javier! Ne! Javier! - Megõrültél, Eugenia? Megõrültél?

66
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,930
There are matters of honor, which are to be solved by man-to-man.

67
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,267
I've come to ask her to give it over to his son.

68
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:15,102
Please, General, I want to do is barbaric.

69
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:16,467
It would not solve anything.

70
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,624
And you know as well as I do, that the law prohibits the duel.

71
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,723
The son of disgraced both my daughter.

72
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:25,797
The desecration ... a little overkill, do not you think?

73
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:31,391
Nobody wants to know if you do not stick to a stupid duel.

74
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,071
Be discreet.

75
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:36,269
And the daughters of honor will remain intact.

76
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:38,069
You're wrong, Doña Teresa.

77
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,620
It will only be intact if you do something for the restoration.

78
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,322
He hands me his son or myself have to do?

79
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,072
You will not believe my mother, but almost Eugenia Lelo ...

80
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,743
- What are you doing, mom? - I will save your life.

81
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:06,393
Sleep with a soldier, both daughters. How can you be so stupid?

82
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,759
If he did not kill Eugenia and her father do.

83
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,300
I travel to. Within a few months only hang-up about it.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,147
You do not care about your family's honor?

85
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:15,800
Your father is rotating in his grave.

86
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,105
Because of me or because of you, my mother?

87
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:25,363
You stay here. And fulfill spousal duties.

88
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:27,899
I think rather get married than to die.

89
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:30,223
I do not take away a woman who nailed a gun at me.

90
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:34,923
On this we agree. The girl is not in his right mind. The sister, Mercedes lost.

91
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:36,859
You can not be serious.

92
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:40,333
If you doubt, you do not know me. In AGREED with his father.

93
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,940
And do not be wanting for lunch. Because announcing your engagement.

94
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:47,335
Doña Teresa, arriving at the hotel, who was waiting for.

95
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:56,001
Try another galibába not get involved in the next hours,

96
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:57,601
if it is not too much to ask.

97
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:11,597
No one can take forth, while I can not say.

98
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:14,134
Especially not a general Herrera and her daughters.

99
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:15,617
Igen, Dona Teresa.

100
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,069
Mateo saw the general's gun was in the safe.

101
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,554
Are you sure you don Javier has made trouble again.

102
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:26,301
Fat takes longer, but the other one.

103
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,233
He found them in bed together.

104
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,495
The sister of the võlegényével, think about it.

105
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:32,734
Don Javierrõl not hard to imagine.

106
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:35,059
Perhaps the walls do not have ears, but I did.

107
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,589
If you ever hear such rumors and comments,

108
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,390
Doña Teresa is going to know about it.

109
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:40,861
Do they understand?

110
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,373
Igen, Don Benjamin.

111
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,917
Cernuda. Espinosa did not see?

112
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,542
This dish should be had to the 15 room.

113
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:54,607
I think even the breakfast is taking off, but do not worry, I'll take.

114
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,813
And do not forget that must be prepared for lunch.

115
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,771
The main events will be, and no one is missing.

116
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:01,892
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:09,001
Sit down.

118
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:13,499
Lift up your sleeves.

119
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:17,488
I suppose you know that on arrest

120
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,674
All the accused are recorded anthropometric data.

121
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:20,784
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:24,128
- They do not measure it? Height, arm. - But, but, but.

123
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:25,530
And they were bathing.

124
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,210
These measurements, which were removed, the anthropometric measurements.

125
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:32,825
One way of identifying convicts. They took me down too.

126
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,336
When I saw the rough tattoo idea that was in prison,

127
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:39,771
so I sent all the dimensions of the authority.

128
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:43,653
And as I expected, I received answers to arrest authority.

129
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,610
Julio did not match any of the data Espinosával.

130
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,120
But Julio agreed to a certain Olmedóval.

131
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,473
Who has been convicted of a minor robbery.

132
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,492
- And if they were the wrong size? - One size may be incorrect. The logic is not.

133
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,994
The last name Olmedo, reminded me of Cristina Olmedo. The maid was gone.

134
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,269
And it explained to you the constant presence of my investigations locations.

135
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:07,479
Or you're wrong?

136
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,599
In my business of silence means yes.

137
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,266
I sat down in the penalty and released.

138
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:19,643
Señor ... Olmedo clamps are the hands? No.

139
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:21,842
This means that I would not arrest him.

140
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:23,940
I just want you to tell me why you're here.

141
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,490
Someone killed my sister.

142
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,054
And I will know it.

143
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,095
Whether you like it or not.

144
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:38,475
Imagine ...

145
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,791
please.

146
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:47,198
The same questions we are looking for answers.

147
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:51,238
And since you are an employee of the hotel, perhaps others knew what I did not.

148
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:55,963
So please, tell me everything you found out.

149
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,075
Pascual ...

150
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:02,453
The receptionist, who was gunned down Murquía Don Diego.

151
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:06,112
Igen. Megzsarolta don Diegót.

152
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,764
- The murder of her sister? - No, I do not think so.

153
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,666
Before he died, he said that Don Diego did not kill my sister.

154
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,783
So he is blackmailing something else.

155
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:16,477
- Do you think that Pascual had killed her sister? - I do not.

156
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:20,287
They were engaged. And she loved him.

157
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:22,974
This is a common motive bûntényeknél.

158
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,508
But go on. What else can you Pascualról?

159
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:31,612
She gathered her belongings and took her sister's house.

160
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:32,762
There, we could not find anything.

161
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:33,922
- You are wearing them? - I do not.

162
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:36,111
They knocked down and taken away from me.

163
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,643
What has brought to the nõvérérõl?

164
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:42,901
The murder ...

165
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,489
Lake of the garden.

166
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,456
The body of the disappeared.

167
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:53,692
Until now.

168
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,928
What do you mean?

169
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:11,131
Mr. Olmedo.

170
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:17,955
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but ...

171
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:26,695
a young woman's body was found in the woods. At least two months dead.

172
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,187
And I think that one is ...

173
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,172
his own sister.

174
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,526
I thought about the dates of the wedding.

175
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,349
Barely a month ago, we engaged.

176
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,257
But things are starting to go well.

177
00:10:57,803 --> 00:11:00,100
And I think that would be a perfect day on November 4.

178
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:04,456
Feast of St. Charles. So your father could somehow present. What do you think?

179
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,765
Dear idea Diego.

180
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,745
But by then it is not already too Sofía delivery, and it would be awkward for him.

181
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,210
Maybe you should look for another visit, is not it?

182
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:17,845
What do you think of the beginning of March it?

183
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:20,432
The sisters will be by then a mother.

184
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:23,864
Of course.

185
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,405
When we announce lunch.

186
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:45,734
Don Bernardo! We have not been already used.

187
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,877
It's that seized the hotels that ours have not visited?

188
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:54,986
Unfortunately, all my time. But I could not refuse the invitation to the hunt.

189
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:58,254
Tell me the truth, my father. I insisted to come.

190
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:01,623
Ignacio! The last time I saw you, did you get any of the knobs.

191
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:04,123
You are just as beautiful and charming as it always has been.

192
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,036
They will not regret coming.

193
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:09,119
And I organized a banquet in your honor.

194
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,408
Ignacio?

195
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,758
- Alicia! - Ignacio!

196
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:18,427
Look at you! Beautiful woman've become!

197
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,594
Don Diego Murquía.

198
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:25,319
Welcome to you. I am the director of the hotel. And the groom.

199
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,354
The current fiancé, you understand.

200
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,672
Alicia was my fiancee.

201
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:32,229
- How long are we? Six-year-olds? - Seven.

202
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,341
- Seven. - Low In our time we were good friends.

203
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,313
And we loved to play together.

204
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:39,107
We could continue the conversation with a tea?

205
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,143
Interference?

206
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:47,743
Why bother?

207
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,298
See you later.

208
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,819
Diego humiliated you in front of everyone.

209
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:55,419
Before my mother.

210
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:59,424
I do not understand how can you be so calm.

211
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,979
We must be patient, and I do like him.

212
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:05,364
Wait for mistakes and to take advantage of it.

213
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:06,782
Wait?

214
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:09,070
Ez a whole?

215
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,229
Good plan for aging. But the hotel management of the acquisition are not.

216
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:18,692
You know Diego is the way I am. Are you sure that more and more messy transaction.

217
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,580
These things leave their mark.

218
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:25,720
- We have to go into his study. - Do not be naive, Sofía.

219
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,009
Do you really think that Diego is compromising anything there?

220
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,553
Everyone nose before?

221
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:35,034
If you would eldugnia before thee, leave it in the middle of the foreground kellõs.

222
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:41,142
If you want to hide something important, I would use the hotel vault.

223
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:44,049
We know where preserves the key?

224
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:51,318
Sofía, I will not scan Diego's room.

225
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:56,137
- You're a coward. - I do not. I am careful.

226
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:58,862
The server must be careful and have the room for girls.

227
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,261
You or Marquis.

228
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:03,875
That's why I'm not going to walk the halls like a common thief.

229
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,166
Forget Diego.

230
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:09,940
It may be that he was the manager, but we will soon be our brand.

231
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:12,289
And our child is born.

232
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:15,345
It is no longer just a job, Alfredo.

233
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:18,527
Diego humiliated you in front of my family, and it can not stay like this.

234
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,297
Why are not these kivasalva tablecloths?

235
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,233
New, so I think you do not have to iron them.

236
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,386
Who gave you this?

237
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:48,410
- I'm your assistant. - Belén. The decisions are mine to make.

238
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,464
It is your responsibility to elvégeztesd them.

239
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:53,082
As early as the first day you're making mistakes.

240
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:56,172
It was impossible to kill them in time.

241
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:58,684
A good housekeeper is able to do the impossible.

242
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,762
Take them and learn from his lesson.

243
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:04,730
Or another, more suitable helper to look for, and it would not take long.

244
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:06,155
Köszönöm, Dona Angela.

245
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:10,631
I will not forget these lessons when you replaced the honeycombs. Once.

246
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:13,320
That should take place within 5 months.

247
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,944
No frowned upon, if you are breast-feeding a housekeeper leave her job.

248
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:22,089
Angela.

249
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:26,785
Someone needs replacement, bed linen Senor Murquía room.

250
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:29,104
Azonnal, Miss Sophia.

251
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,044
Belén, go.

252
00:15:31,502 --> 00:15:34,239
And if you are ready, the table cloths are ironed out.

253
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:53,482
What are you waiting for? Open up.

254
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:05,552
- Once you're done, clean up the room. - Yes, ma'am.

255
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:30,437
- Are you done? - No, ma'am.

256
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,237
You can do your job.

257
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,641
We found him in the river. Already overgrown with weeds.

258
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,921
At least two months dead.

259
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:55,335
It will be very unpleasant sight.

260
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:58,044
Are you sure you're ready?

261
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:02,750
Again.

262
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:15,062
Please.

263
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,084
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,048
It is not.

265
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:57,097
He had dark hair.

266
00:17:58,451 --> 00:17:59,920
And it was not so stout.

267
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,073
It did not Cristina, that's for sure.

268
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:08,282
- Senor Olmedo, a lot of time has passed. - I do not know who it is, but not my sister.

269
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,151
Hernando, please.

270
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:26,635
Check the archive if there are such, that seemed to be

271
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:28,828
Young girl in recent months.

272
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,175
If it's not your sister, the situation is complicated, Senor Olmedo.

273
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:44,017
So far, only Jimena, the girl's body was found in the street, maybe he remembers.

274
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:46,825
And we assume that your sister died.

275
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,884
I have not two woman.

276
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:52,915
But from three.

277
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:09,561
Here, the best coffee I could find. Awful. It's not like the hotel.

278
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:11,437
I'm not used to their server.

279
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:13,881
To this girl died?

280
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,255
They were stabbed.

281
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:19,099
A scar is the same as the murdered prostitutes.

282
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,216
Do you think that your sister is so dead?

283
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:24,417
The judging from his clothes found bloodstains, very likely.

284
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,355
- Do you know who this woman? - No, no, no, sir.

285
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:31,652
- Nobody disappeared? - On the contrary. Several people also.

286
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:36,200
During the past four months it disappeared Cantaloából and környékérõl.

287
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,152
A street girl Jimena. August 24th

288
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,020
A maid Cristina Olmedo. July 25th

289
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:53,655
A peasant girl Dorotea Prieto. June 25th

290
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:56,085
The description corresponds to the miserable,

291
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:59,351
who lies in our makeshift ravatalozónkban. But proceed.

292
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:02,809
A sewing girl Adela Gómez. May 27th

293
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,905
Another peasant girl Irene Castaño. April 27th

294
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,299
And a beggar, whom he called 'Swallow'

295
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:13,332
and whose disappearance is the most difficult to define. It was in March.

296
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:19,096
All they killed during the night or disappeared Cantaloából.

297
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:21,700
- And it was all young. - Do you think that one person did it?

298
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:25,024
The opposite would be strange coincidence.

299
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,948
Olmedo Señor, I am afraid that his sister was a victim of obsessive compulsive,

300
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:34,511
that psychiatry 'lack of moral health as' recognized

301
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:37,060
and who commit ritual murders.

302
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,712
I soon learned that this Jimena stabbed with a knife,

303
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:45,013
Dorotea and that wound was perfectly match it.

304
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,299
I fear that the other woman also died the same way.

305
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:50,749
But let's see the dates.

306
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,997
Roughly one victim a month.

307
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:55,272
Or a month.

308
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:00,868
I do not know much about the moral similar things.

309
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:03,182
But I come from peasant families.

310
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:05,868
Sowing and harvesting, and the moon align.

311
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:08,502
It is possible.

312
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:14,442
Perhaps the art dates from the moon are aligned. It would not be the first case.

313
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:19,894
Jimena day after the arrival of the hotel was killed. And there was a full moon. I remember.

314
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,351
And when will the next?

315
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:26,920
But ...

316
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:30,711
Do you think he's going to kill again?

317
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:34,701
Yes. But it will be a problem.

318
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:38,064
We have the weapons.

319
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:43,257
It is a pity that our families were so far away from each other so much time.

320
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:47,139
The years spent here were really happy ....

321
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:51,178
We were children. The kids are always happy.

322
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:53,429
Yes. And I thought it was all still remain,

323
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,904
and the game becomes a reality, remember?

324
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,278
- Ignacio, I'm the bride. - I know I know.

325
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,560
And what you want?

326
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,831
Yes. So the best for me and my family.

327
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,565
Would I believe if you had answered yes.

328
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,280
Because if you really love someone, there is no need for arguments.

329
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:20,355
Ignacio, if you'll excuse me for a moment.

330
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:23,380
- I'll start with lunch. - Just be a minute.

331
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:33,949
July!

332
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,241
I was worried.

333
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:42,844
Ayalával Why did you leave?

334
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:44,915
He realized who I was.

335
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,504
How did you know it?

336
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,145
I do not know, but it does not matter.

337
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:51,081
He realized he was looking for the same thing. How many things have happened.

338
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:53,294
He unearthed another dead woman.

339
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:55,783
And he believes the killer will try again today.

340
00:22:57,641 --> 00:23:00,352
He thinks the same way. Gold is one of the knife.

341
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:03,029
The detective and his men to watch all the exits.

342
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:05,594
I do not have to verify that no knife is missing or not.

343
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,603
And why is not he doing it?

344
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:11,348
According to Ayala mother she did not really want to help him.

345
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,470
It is open.

346
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:19,728
That can not be.

347
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,842
July, my ez to ruha rajtad? Miss Alarcon.

348
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:25,860
Andrés, do not know where the gold dinnerware?

349
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:28,470
In the dining room. Don Bernardo Alonso honor for lunch.

350
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:31,318
And do Benjamín up there waiting for us. So get dressed and come up as soon as possible.

351
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:33,461
Anyone can take it away with a golden knife.

352
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:35,917
- This complicates the situation. - What situation?

353
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,375
Andrés, you have to help us.

354
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,591
The lunch will be four tables.

355
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:47,995
Each of them will have a golden knife dinner services.

356
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:51,422
Which one for you, Andres? Andres?

357
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:53,763
- Is something wrong, Andrés? - No, no, Señorita Alarcón.

358
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:55,669
If there is the entrance, it's mine.

359
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:57,979
Fõasztalnál I will be with my family.

360
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:01,321
- It will be mine. - He will sit in the general's daughters.

361
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,693
Barreda's table and left without a Biro felügylet. With what?

362
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:19,160
Investigation ... what are you doing here?

363
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,424
Do not worry, Doña Teresa. I'm not here as an investigator.

364
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,686
Even a man like me, you need to relax.

365
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:32,062
This is understandable. But as I recall, we were not invited to this lunch.

366
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:36,780
Barreda referee was kind to invite me to his table.

367
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,421
And stop you to try the legendary cuisine, it would be a sin.

368
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:46,307
Mr. Ayala,

369
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,980
I do not want you to think, to feel any resentment towards you.

370
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:55,872
Due to my work I'm so used to such treatment,

371
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:59,812
I would feel strange if my presence does not bother anyone.

372
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,443
Well, I'm sorry, but I need to feel the ill effects corpse to you.

373
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,178
And I hope you do not mind having Barreda.

374
00:25:06,476 --> 00:25:10,978
But it would be an honor to know you at your table.

375
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:12,309
And I accept it.

376
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,669
- Senor Murquía. - I'm busy.

377
00:25:22,194 --> 00:25:26,063
I can not think about that Doña Sofía opened its me your room.

378
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:31,301
And you did it?

379
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:32,574
What could I do?

380
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:37,860
Doña Teresa's daughter ... and said I need to peel off your bedding, but ...

381
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:41,221
- It was not the reason. - And what were you doing in my room?

382
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:44,419
I do not know. But körbeszaglászott everywhere.

383
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:48,108
Why did you tell me?

384
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:52,961
They had problems with Diego, but I want you to know that I'm on your side.

385
00:25:55,994 --> 00:25:57,507
I'm glad to hear that.

386
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,646
With kerestetek?

387
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:18,587
- I do not know what you mean. - You were in my room, right?

388
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,264
- You can play the fool on, Sofía ... - Diego, do not ...

389
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:23,479
Do not you dare!

390
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:37,581
What were you doing, Sofía?

391
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:44,328
I know that you did not find anything, because I'm not hiding anything.

392
00:26:47,227 --> 00:26:48,966
Does not occur anymore, understand?

393
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,450
I told you.

394
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:57,563
Look at what happened.

395
00:26:59,642 --> 00:27:01,140
What happened to Alfredo?

396
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:03,826
Diego raised his voice slightly.

397
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,203
Or a boy, or a grown-up man?

398
00:27:09,783 --> 00:27:13,799
Diego knows what you did. And did not you do anything with it.

399
00:27:14,907 --> 00:27:16,737
We are worse off than before.

400
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,763
It is impossible to be self-realized.

401
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:23,155
An ally told him.

402
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:28,720
There is a maid who can not afford to lose sight Belén.

403
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,418
Doña Angela segédje.

404
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,725
Can you come in?

405
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:44,055
Ángela, please.

406
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:48,133
I guess you know why called you.

407
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,497
Sir, while you are a guest in the hotel, whatever you want, I'm available.

408
00:27:54,597 --> 00:27:57,024
The perfect answer to the perfect házvezetõnõtõl.

409
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:01,893
Angela, megduplázom to fizetésedet has átjössz to madridi hotelembe.

410
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:03,069
What do you say?

411
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,000
My place is here.

412
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:08,819
A talented housekeeper essential for proper functioning of any hotel.

413
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:12,163
Don Bernardo, ha megbocsátja
merészségemet...

414
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:13,473
Sure.

415
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:16,356
Perhaps from acquiring a good housekeeper.

416
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:18,979
I'm listening.

417
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:21,828
A segítõm. Bethlehem Martin.

418
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:26,743
It has végeztek Enrique szobájával, tisztítsátok ki szõnyegeket.

419
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:34,323
- Bethlehem Martin? - Igen?

420
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,548
You are the helper housekeeper, right?

421
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,843
- Yes. Did something happen? - I do not.

422
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:42,121
But do you know the people looking into my hotel in Madrid.

423
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:46,578
Here is a good job and a good salary. And my quarters.

424
00:28:46,678 --> 00:28:49,719
Maid is no longer needed. Just a housekeeper.

425
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:53,088
Would you like your housekeeper would I be?

426
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:56,038
A luxury hotel. Almost like it.

427
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:59,991
You would have your own room, and earn twice as much.

428
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:05,923
Here you go some allowance I do not think that you can provide.

429
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:09,648
But in my hotel should not jump whim of others.

430
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,515
I spend a little time there, near the affairs of my employees trust.

431
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,105
It would be superior, and the decisions could bring to your liking.

432
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:22,084
I do not know whether the bonus is comparable with those you mentioned,

433
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:25,683
but I assure you that my hotel were to live better and more relaxed.

434
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:38,115
Sorry I'm late.

435
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,822
You look beautiful.

436
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:41,562
Thank you.

437
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:44,333
Are we going? My mother is already waiting for us sure.

438
00:29:44,673 --> 00:29:45,933
We have a problem.

439
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:49,669
General Herrera's table to sit to calm him;

440
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:52,560
and supervise your brother. I would appreciate if you sit next to me.

441
00:29:53,644 --> 00:29:55,000
A menyasszonyomként.

442
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:04,459
I do not think that would be wrong. To us another table as a family.

443
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,257
The etiquette permits, Alicia.

444
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:11,673
I want to sit with my family, Diego.

445
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:14,214
Of course.

446
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:50,969
Espinosa. Why was delayed so much?

447
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,605
One of the guests poured my shoes and went to clean up, sir.

448
00:30:55,705 --> 00:30:59,359
Try. The others have been working for quite some time.

449
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:10,054
I do not see what you are looking for Ayala Alarcón table.

450
00:31:10,154 --> 00:31:12,062
Who will supervise so Barreda judge's table?

451
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:18,055
What do you think? Let Exchangeable table. If Lady recognizable, you're done.

452
00:31:18,685 --> 00:31:21,770
I do not know how you do it, but you're still having problems become my gondjaimmá.

453
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:33,571
Espinosa, why Cernudával changed?

454
00:31:34,324 --> 00:31:36,577
I do not know. He asked.

455
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,184
- Cernuda? - Igen.

456
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,162
Why Espinosával changed?

457
00:31:49,383 --> 00:31:52,405
Well ... you know how generous the Lady borravalóval.

458
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:55,656
And I wanted to buy presents for my mom. The birthday.

459
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:58,254
What will be five months from now?

460
00:31:58,354 --> 00:31:59,854
Very expensive gift.

461
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:05,093
Well okay. Espinosának thank the favor.

462
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:32,399
Alicia. Alicia?

463
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,345
My father asked me a question.

464
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:35,977
Sorry.

465
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:40,634
I asked how many server must serve so many tables?

466
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,093
As you need.

467
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:47,046
Serving one more, one less dissatisfied guests - as my father said.

468
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,664
Barreda judge. Sorry but you can not make it.

469
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:08,152
Ayala, I hope you did not miss by much.

470
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:12,913
Such a glamorous woman in the company of a man would miss indecency.

471
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:19,293
How gallant. And what about the number of waiters? Considers it enough?

472
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:21,853
I assure you that if the number of security forces

473
00:33:21,953 --> 00:33:25,494
It would be as big as your hotel, and directed them as well,

474
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:28,813
They liquidated within a week of the crime kingdom.

475
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:30,325
You really generous.

476
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,831
It is a pity that the waiters are not good investigators.

477
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:40,286
A waitress, a good waiter, and always pay attention to every detail

478
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:43,905
It goes one step further. Both also feature a good detective.

479
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:47,184
My father always wanted the best of the hotel.

480
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:49,722
Therefore so happy when I married Alfredóhoz.

481
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:54,121
The correct position can provide fame to the hotel.

482
00:33:54,421 --> 00:33:58,523
The mere presence of your husband's reputation for providing it. True, my dear?

483
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,572
I'm flattered that you think so, Doña Teresa.

484
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:08,086
But our son will Alarcón Vergara and The Count, who unites the two families.

485
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:11,856
Brother worried about the delay.

486
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,852
While it does not arrive, not to announce her engagement.

487
00:34:15,758 --> 00:34:17,055
You know how Javier.

488
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:19,060
That's why I'm worried.

489
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:51,718
Tell your partner,

490
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,419
You must be within two cuts of the knife perfectly clean.

491
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,574
Yes, sir.

492
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:02,459
If carried out with the meat, leaving the blade in the system tray.

493
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,964
It will be easier to keep an eye on them.

494
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,244
For now, all is well.

495
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:13,635
The knife must not be from here on out.

496
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:15,842
July July mehetsz the nem.

497
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:49,048
Espinosa, why did you take his place?

498
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:54,610
Sorry, Benjamín do. Someone brought this knife from the tray and looked.

499
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:58,434
One such piece is not to kallódhat.

500
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,103
Place back in the dining room.

501
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:21,181
Can we expect the presence of the hunt, Don Diego?

502
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:25,771
Sure. Even though I was seated next to the secretary of the minister of defense.

503
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:26,938
I am grateful for it.

504
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:30,093
You do not know how much longer I want to use my gun.

505
00:36:31,015 --> 00:36:36,289
My dear, if you do not like it, let me know. The kitchen prepare anything for you.

506
00:36:36,744 --> 00:36:42,633
Last year, I do not know how they did it, but it brought me strawberries in mid-January!

507
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:44,893
My appetite.

508
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:48,455
- I do not want this engagement. - Yeah.

509
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:51,508
- Because you did not do anything, right? - Eugenia behave.

510
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:54,092
- They took me to my fiancée, because of you! - Daughter! Daughter!

511
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:57,246
- You leave this to my father! - Eugenia, come back!

512
00:37:00,307 --> 00:37:01,361
Javier.

513
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:04,677
Please. I can supply.

514
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:07,925
We could start again.

515
00:37:09,046 --> 00:37:10,310
You know I love you.

516
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,405
I think a little late.

517
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:40,100
Instead of such an entry you would be allowed to stay in your room as well.

518
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,218
I'm notification of new engagements, mother.

519
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,247
Well, we drink to this!

520
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,120
As you ideállítottál,

521
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:53,266
not to announce her engagement, but it's still getting married.

522
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:55,416
Put down the glass.

523
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:58,292
Go to the bride's table, they wear you out.

524
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:00,818
In such a state, I do not think we get the point.

525
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:02,449
And I do not want to marry this woman.

526
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:05,043
And none of the others did not, he rámerõszakol you, mother.

527
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:10,505
I remind the generals can kill you. I will leave you with nothing.

528
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,292
The decision is up to you.

529
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:11,838
- I hope you enjoyed your lunch. - Very well.

530
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:14,630
Although not as much as your company, Doña Teresa.

531
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:19,469
I'm beginning to understand why choose this place is so relaxing.

532
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:24,143
Let's be honest, Detective. It really was just to relax?

533
00:39:24,243 --> 00:39:27,925
It's hard to believe that your research megpihennének eyes for a moment.

534
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:31,157
As I see your eyes no rest ever, Doña Teresa.

535
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:32,934
In alike.

536
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:34,534
Good afternoon.

537
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:37,814
- Nyomozó. - Miss Alarcon ...

538
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,667
You are amazing.

539
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:44,132
When Julio said that two people in this hotel, in whom blindly

540
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:47,442
trust, I did not think that you are one of them.

541
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:49,530
Not too familiar,

542
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,391
that a lady as you cultivate a friendship with someone like Senor ...

543
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,844
Espinosa.

544
00:39:55,315 --> 00:39:57,322
I know all the employees of the hotel.

545
00:39:57,422 --> 00:39:58,933
And I like to get along well with them.

546
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,878
I did not say it because serving ...

547
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:04,634
but because of the criminal elõélete.

548
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,516
I knew as soon as I saw the tattoo on his arm.

549
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,239
Then they helped me to find out that he Cristina Olmedo's younger brother.

550
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,410
The knives are in place.

551
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:21,529
- We'll take turns guarding. - Thank you very much.

552
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:25,613
My people will pay attention to the two gates: the main entrance and the staff.

553
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:27,765
If you need me, I'll be outside.

554
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:29,581
We must stand ready for this evening.

555
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,031
What does the tattoo on your arm?

556
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,622
- Just a nonsense. What does it matter ... - Where did it?

557
00:40:49,623 --> 00:40:50,655
What does it matter?

558
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:54,240
- In my village, Blancaróban ... - First titkolózol, now you're lying.

559
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,748
Ayala told me everything. I know you were in prison.

560
00:40:57,077 --> 00:40:59,978
- Alicia, I can explain ... - Of course. But I do not want to hear it.

561
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:01,096
Alicia!

562
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,972
- Is there a problem, Señorita Alarcón? - No, no.

563
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:12,525
- Put away the last one, Espinosa. - Yes, Benjamín do.

564
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:37,935
- Everything went well. It's over, is not it? - Not yet. Shall be supervised in the cabinet.

565
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:41,357
- Me? - Something is not checked.

566
00:41:41,557 --> 00:41:42,575
Ayala will speak to you.

567
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:44,573
As soon as possible leváltalak.

568
00:41:51,002 --> 00:41:52,646
You monitors the main entrance.

569
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:56,103
Motozzon everyone whose appearance or behavior of the suspect.

570
00:41:56,777 --> 00:42:00,171
Hernando, you have the rear. I will help if need be.

571
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:01,513
Yes, sir.

572
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:19,222
- I see what you bring in? - Yes, sir.

573
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,204
You can go.

574
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:34,630
"I look forward to the festival of light. When the power is inaugurated.

575
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:37,261
From then on everything will be easier for me.

576
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:45,751
You can not imagine how hard it

577
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,578
megtiszítani the candlesticks around the dripping wax.

578
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:52,639
Always everything must be unimpeachable. Perfect.

579
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,834
As if it were new.

580
00:43:00,216 --> 00:43:02,134
But this is only the appearance, Julio.

581
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:03,734
As in humans.

582
00:43:04,636 --> 00:43:07,053
We must always smile and flawless be.

583
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:10,152
And because of this, which is in fact, hurt even more.

584
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:14,233
Here, everyone is hiding something, and nothing is as it seems.

585
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,846
Therefore, I want you to see. "

586
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:17,978
July!

587
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:20,315
Don Benjamín ask whether the waste is exported.

588
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:21,915
Tell him you did.

589
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:40,909
I have given orders to clean up the first-floor carpets.

590
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:44,990
You can now polish out of the bathrooms have copper.

591
00:43:46,308 --> 00:43:48,521
I am your helper. That's not my job.

592
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:50,394
But I trusted you.

593
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:57,898
- Don Bernardo spoke to me. - You will polish the brass?

594
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,806
Work recommended the hotel. Házvezetõnõit.

595
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:05,637
And paying a lot more than yours.

596
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:11,755
- If you go with me, I will just win. - I am very happy, ma'am.

597
00:44:11,855 --> 00:44:13,224
Because I said yes.

598
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,347
You do not have to endure any more of your excesses.

599
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,875
From now on they will obey.

600
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:21,309
And my son to accept?

601
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:23,456
A fia?

602
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:27,550
Andrew?

603
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:28,996
Speaking ...

604
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,644
What happened with you?

605
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:42,750
The bad news is difficult to tell. So I'll be straight.

606
00:44:43,712 --> 00:44:44,755
I'll leave.

607
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:46,402
Why?

608
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:49,176
- If, due to my mother ... - No, that's not it.

609
00:44:50,546 --> 00:44:52,504
I was offered a job in another hotel.

610
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:55,507
- Don Bernardo volt?
- Igen.

611
00:44:56,646 --> 00:44:58,966
You will pay more and housekeeper.

612
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:06,017
I do not know. I could go with you. You did not ask whether there is a waitress?

613
00:45:11,312 --> 00:45:15,416
Your mother needs you. But he would not leave the hotel.

614
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,210
- But I love you. - I love you too.

615
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,179
But this is no longer the future.

616
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:27,971
Your place is here, not mine. I'm so sorry.

617
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:29,131
Ne, Bethlehem!

618
00:45:29,135 --> 00:45:31,583
- Do not do it even more difficult! - No, you make it even more difficult!

619
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:33,867
Women always túlbonyolítanak everything!

620
00:46:34,986 --> 00:46:38,656
Miss. Hey, Miss. Miss.

621
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:43,705
What happened? They stabbed?

622
00:46:44,783 --> 00:46:45,888
No. Leeshetett.

623
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:47,488
Quick! Call me a doctor!

624
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:51,582
Miss. Hey. Breathe. Breathe.

625
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:57,660
Miss, come on.

626
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,072
- You listen. The details. - Investigation.

627
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,299
Something happened to the rear gate.

628
00:47:08,399 --> 00:47:09,399
Stay here.

629
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,453
How's the woman who lost?

630
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:17,917
They are taken to the room. The doctor will perform immediately.

631
00:47:18,983 --> 00:47:21,550
How many of you went out so that it does not researched into them?

632
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,237
I do not know. Four or five.

633
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:26,320
- They went to the village. - For God's sake, Hernando!

634
00:47:30,924 --> 00:47:32,612
The étkezõszekrény!

635
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:40,812
Andrew! Andrew!

636
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:43,507
Are you okay?

637
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:45,107
They forced open.

638
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,936
And a missing knife.

639
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,107
What is it, young man?

640
00:47:56,365 --> 00:48:01,766
I do not know. I am sitting in here and all of a sudden I heard a noise and then a mighty blow,

641
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:02,971
and I do not remember anything else.

642
00:48:03,275 --> 00:48:05,355
Gentlemen, you already have the killer weapon.

643
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,046
And it may be headed toward the village.

644
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:22,464
The doctor has not lost hope. You do not lose it, Eugenia.

645
00:48:24,132 --> 00:48:27,012
Your sister needs your prayers more than your tears.

646
00:48:29,169 --> 00:48:31,294
I was mad at her father.

647
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:37,176
But I know that what happened does not matter.

648
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,708
How are you?

649
00:48:52,395 --> 00:48:54,295
Do not move! Stay calm, son.

650
00:48:58,329 --> 00:48:59,530
A jég, Dona Angela.

651
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,119
Hogy van Mecedes Miss Herrera?

652
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:08,216
It's stable. Which means that they do not know better will be.

653
00:49:08,435 --> 00:49:12,280
My mother, I can not work with this tomorrow, and you know, the hotel's image ...

654
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,705
Squeeze it here. Tomorrow lelappad swelling, and the detachable bond.

655
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:19,941
Let only.

656
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,126
Feel better?

657
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:22,726
- So. - Yes.

658
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,625
The hotel can not afford an incapacitated

659
00:49:28,626 --> 00:49:30,613
and a waiter taking care of her.

660
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,618
As you wish, Doña Ángela.

661
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,718
Get well soon.

662
00:49:39,336 --> 00:49:42,323
You were lucky, my son, it could have been fatal.

663
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:46,406
Yes. But there are shocks that hurt more than anything.

664
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:50,978
Belén abandoned.

665
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:52,849
He goes to the hotel.

666
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:58,256
I know you did not like him, but ... I loved it.

667
00:50:00,237 --> 00:50:04,417
Andrés is not good for a mother to see her son suffer.

668
00:50:05,282 --> 00:50:09,088
- But over time you realize it's for the best. - I do not.

669
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,781
It's never going to happen, my mother.

670
00:50:14,105 --> 00:50:15,535
I can not find anything like him.

671
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:25,996
- Where are you going? - I walk in the garden, my father.

672
00:50:26,096 --> 00:50:27,491
Miss Aliciával, nem?

673
00:50:28,168 --> 00:50:30,366
They got engaged. And he Alarcón.

674
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:33,335
Take care, son. I do not want you to suffer.

675
00:50:33,435 --> 00:50:34,460
Good friend.

676
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:36,223
It always has.

677
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:39,820
You are responsible for the level of it?

678
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,098
Continue your work, Antonio.

679
00:50:43,049 --> 00:50:44,804
I'll talk to Senor Alonso.

680
00:50:46,888 --> 00:50:49,687
Maybe I can help you. What do you want?

681
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:51,730
Ask for a cup of tea.

682
00:50:52,423 --> 00:50:56,538
You do not need to come into the hall. Csengethetsz your room as well.

683
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:00,046
Do not look for another excuse Bernardo.

684
00:51:00,146 --> 00:51:02,804
Quite annoying that you want to steal the munkásaimat,

685
00:51:02,904 --> 00:51:05,453
and even worse, when you look foolish.

686
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,779
You talk to the employees, as if they were property.

687
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:11,752
I'm just a better job and salary offered to them.

688
00:51:11,753 --> 00:51:12,753
Behind me.

689
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:16,031
Some people come here to have the letters not recognized.

690
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:17,809
And I learned a profession.

691
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:21,431
And now that I picked this fruit, you want to marry you.

692
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:24,538
I took from you a couple of employees. Carlos stole from me this hotel.

693
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:27,843
- Well, this is all about. Revenge. - Business.

694
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:30,036
One lesson you taught your husband.

695
00:51:30,777 --> 00:51:33,528
- That the friendship does not mean anything. - I will not insult you more.

696
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:36,549
- Carlos was a gentleman. - And what are you doing? It offers're throwing away?

697
00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:38,149
Of course not.

698
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,141
It would not be too smart move my part. As your part even if you stay here.

699
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:46,123
I'm not going to discharge.

700
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,289
The cabinet assigns tonight, Don Diego.

701
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:57,743
I started to be checked by an rooms but

702
00:51:57,843 --> 00:52:00,236
may have been the thief took from the hotel.

703
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:07,981
The same lock mount.

704
00:52:09,456 --> 00:52:14,507
But confirm. I do not want any repetition of that.

705
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,641
- Exterminator me then? - Of course.

706
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:21,264
Good luck, you!

707
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:23,499
- You're going to really miss him. - You too me.

708
00:52:24,068 --> 00:52:26,787
We need more towels and cold water Señorita Mercedes room.

709
00:52:26,887 --> 00:52:28,013
Immediately, Don Diego.

710
00:52:35,701 --> 00:52:38,392
- Are you leaving? - Don Bernard is included.

711
00:52:47,102 --> 00:52:49,329
This solves every problem, is not it?

712
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:54,026
For my part, the problems have been resolved, Belén.

713
00:52:54,876 --> 00:52:56,342
I'm going to miss?

714
00:52:58,024 --> 00:53:00,036
Many things will be missing.

715
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,084
One thing will be missing here.

716
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:07,676
This is not the appropriate moment.

717
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:09,739
Others will no longer be.

718
00:53:13,373 --> 00:53:15,481
You have to be satisfied with what it was.

719
00:53:21,774 --> 00:53:23,340
Don Bernardo, I'm here.

720
00:53:24,206 --> 00:53:26,983
I'm sorry, but my offer to be involved.

721
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:28,125
Why?

722
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:30,751
I found out you're pregnant.

723
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,246
I can not let my housekeeper

724
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:36,114
In the first months of the hotel to go to give birth.

725
00:53:36,795 --> 00:53:38,885
- Who told you? - I was.

726
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:46,635
Did you really think that I do not know who goes and who stays in the hotel, you?

727
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:52,764
Now I should say that if you have already packed up, then leave.

728
00:53:54,169 --> 00:53:56,400
The traitors deserve.

729
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:59,543
But I do not do it.

730
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:02,209
Due to the child?

731
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:07,971
Deal. And five more months to complete a part of you.

732
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:13,690
Hold.

733
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,999
But that's a lot of money.

734
00:54:23,836 --> 00:54:25,055
Who gets the child?

735
00:54:25,056 --> 00:54:27,539
I do not want money in exchange for the questions.

736
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:29,130
Yes, ma'am.

737
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,665
This changeover will take effect after five months.

738
00:54:31,765 --> 00:54:33,093
That left the szülésedig.

739
00:54:33,266 --> 00:54:35,886
Until then, you can not get to it, but it's yours.

740
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:38,602
To remind you that you owe me.

741
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:42,368
- And then? - You leave the hotel.

742
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,583
In the meantime, do your old job.

743
00:54:46,755 --> 00:54:49,134
- Szintfelelõsként? - As a Maid.

744
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:52,676
And can thank. I am very generous with you.

745
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:55,982
Yes, ma'am.

746
00:54:58,512 --> 00:54:59,794
Can I go now?

747
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,485
It'll have to continue to tolerate.

748
00:55:15,585 --> 00:55:17,752
- I'm not leaving. - I know.

749
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,097
I spoke to Doña Teresa.

750
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:26,970
If you leave now, my son will suffer, and do not forget. It'd be a martyr for.

751
00:55:28,473 --> 00:55:34,390
But if you stay, I'll show him what you truly are. And then you're done.

752
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:06,276
You were you, right? You pushed him off.

753
00:56:07,025 --> 00:56:09,421
Now we have no one to stand between us.

754
00:56:10,573 --> 00:56:12,587
How could you do with your sister?

755
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:15,380
And that he would have taken it, I liked best?

756
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,080
Come here, Javier.

757
00:56:18,562 --> 00:56:20,256
I'll tell everyone what you've done.

758
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:25,108
And I tell you, it was you.

759
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,835
And who would believe it?

760
00:56:28,008 --> 00:56:33,491
An upper-class girl ... or a drunken fall.

761
00:56:34,648 --> 00:56:36,804
If you're not mine, nobody will, Javier.

762
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:41,612
We have time until tomorrow to ask my father to renew our engagement.

763
00:56:42,286 --> 00:56:46,313
Or I'll tell everyone you're my sister pushed him out.

764
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:52,161
No. No no no ...

765
00:56:53,882 --> 00:56:55,771
- What happened? - No, my father.

766
00:56:56,155 --> 00:56:58,687
Javier scared me, but I do not think it was intentional.

767
00:56:58,787 --> 00:56:59,824
Of course not.

768
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:05,098
Stay away from the lányaimtól.

769
00:57:21,675 --> 00:57:26,916
The Cernuda has been mild shock. So you can get back to work tomorrow.

770
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,381
I am glad that Andrés fine. And Señorita Herrera?

771
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:35,247
Serious condition. But fortunately there are still among us.

772
00:57:35,462 --> 00:57:37,241
All right. Thank you, Benjamín.

773
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:42,809
The reason I wanted to come to my father, to restore family relationships,

774
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:44,874
and what he did, excuse me, is despicable.

775
00:57:44,974 --> 00:57:46,474
- It's business, Ignacio. - I do not.

776
00:57:47,405 --> 00:57:49,299
It ruined the family's reputation.

777
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:06,735
Alicia, forgive me. I did not know what my father made.

778
00:58:06,835 --> 00:58:09,313
If I had not I make every effort to come.

779
00:58:09,378 --> 00:58:11,481
Although I would not see you again.

780
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:17,686
I do not know what happened, Ignacio. But ... whatever it is, I know I can trust you.

781
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:23,003
A message for you, Señorita Alarcón.

782
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:32,747
"I need to see you. I do not want what happened ruin our relationship.

783
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:35,643
We need to talk. I will be the first-floor corridor. "

784
00:58:39,077 --> 00:58:40,161
Thank you.

785
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:48,018
See you tomorrow before I leave?

786
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:53,897
Again.

787
00:58:57,404 --> 00:58:58,727
Then it does not bother you further.

788
00:59:09,073 --> 00:59:11,486
- Where are you going? - In my room. Relax.

789
00:59:11,586 --> 00:59:13,534
- Felkísérlek. - It is not necessary, thank you.

790
00:59:39,878 --> 00:59:41,295
We should not meet here.

791
00:59:42,388 --> 00:59:46,456
They stole one gold knife. Ayala tries to find the culprit.

792
00:59:46,556 --> 00:59:49,844
- You've come to tell me that? - To ask you, take care.

793
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:52,060
And to explain things.

794
00:59:52,504 --> 00:59:53,660
Cecilia.

795
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,086
This is what the "C" which is tattooed on my arm.

796
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,638
Blancaróban I fell in love.

797
00:59:59,279 --> 01:00:00,720
Because of him I got to prison.

798
01:00:02,468 --> 01:00:04,287
And why you were carried out in prison?

799
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,415
He spoke to a woman who has been very valuable jewels and ...

800
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:12,683
- ... And made me steal them away. - And you robbed?

801
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:15,245
Again.

802
01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:18,619
I gave Cecilia, take care of them.

803
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,695
The next day, the police arrested.

804
01:00:21,775 --> 01:00:25,775
No I owed to him and the prison tattooed myself in my first letter.

805
01:00:27,399 --> 01:00:31,371
A little later I learned that Cecilia betrayed to save himself.

806
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:35,689
He fled with jewels, and I did not hear from him again.

807
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:39,222
And I did not want you to think that's why I came to the hotel.

808
01:00:39,522 --> 01:00:40,642
Therefore, I do not tell.

809
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,585
Well, that's the story.

810
01:00:46,123 --> 01:00:49,490
I always had a talent for it ... They fell in love, whom he should not.

811
01:00:52,973 --> 01:00:54,943
And trust the wrong man.

812
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:57,545
Alicia.

813
01:00:59,747 --> 01:01:00,961
Diego, what happened?

814
01:01:02,657 --> 01:01:03,752
Who is it?

815
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:07,044
I do not know what you're talking about.

816
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:08,680
Do not lie to me.

817
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:16,063
"I need to see you. I do not want what happened ruin our relationship."

818
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,564
What happened?

819
01:01:19,002 --> 01:01:21,228
What's between you and the person from this?

820
01:01:22,699 --> 01:01:23,909
It was me.

821
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:26,019
I sent the message.

822
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:35,064
Ignacio! No, no, no, no! No, stop! Stand down, please!

823
01:01:35,164 --> 01:01:38,280
- Do not! No! Stop! - What happened between you, Alicia?

824
01:01:38,281 --> 01:01:39,980
- Nothing, nothing, nothing happened. - Stop!

825
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,154
I sent a message to apologize for the crime of my father.

826
01:01:43,429 --> 01:01:45,946
I do not want to ruin our friendship, that's it.

827
01:01:47,923 --> 01:01:49,787
That's right. Just wanted to ask for forgiveness.

828
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:12,410
Free.

829
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,849
I'm sorry about what happened, Diego.

830
01:02:23,681 --> 01:02:26,508
You do not have to explain, it was all a misunderstanding.

831
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:30,212
You can too. Ignacio was not supposed to strike.

832
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:31,812
Especially not in front of the guests.

833
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:35,345
It was not a big deal. Neither shocks nor humiliation.

834
01:02:40,194 --> 01:02:41,682
Therefore I do not feel bad.

835
01:02:42,486 --> 01:02:44,267
I always control myself.

836
01:02:44,585 --> 01:02:45,939
Very well.

837
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:49,663
But most of us are,

838
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:54,051
I feel for you,

839
01:02:57,269 --> 01:02:58,528
it is too much.

840
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:07,145
It was right. This behavior only farther away.

841
01:03:07,245 --> 01:03:08,296
And I'm really sorry.

842
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:11,560
I apologize.

843
01:03:12,428 --> 01:03:14,532
For having doubted you.

844
01:03:14,632 --> 01:03:17,447
The reason why I thought I'd be able to lie to ...

845
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,923
To see you with someone while you're planning to come to me.

846
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:27,434
No, Diego.

847
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:43,726
If there is something that needs to be made, it is forgiven.

848
01:03:59,423 --> 01:04:00,523
Javier?

849
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:05,181
Where are you going?

850
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:08,081
To find this Ayala detective to justice.

851
01:04:08,082 --> 01:04:10,314
Drunk in the middle of the night? What are you saying?

852
01:04:10,315 --> 01:04:12,421
You know what happened to Mercedes-winds, the general's daughter?

853
01:04:12,868 --> 01:04:13,981
Accident.

854
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:16,641
Accident? You think you are, but I know the truth.

855
01:04:16,642 --> 01:04:19,242
And once in my life I'm going to do the right thing. Look out of the way!

856
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:22,086
- You can not go so Cantaloába! - Tomorrow will be even worse!

857
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:24,485
Javier!

858
01:04:39,683 --> 01:04:41,149
Motozza that man.

859
01:04:56,326 --> 01:05:00,509
Ma'am, please go home immediately. Keep up to.

860
01:05:15,002 --> 01:05:17,951
July! Segítened kell to bátyámnak!

861
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:21,229
- What are you doing? - Cantaloába go, he drank a lot and ...

862
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:23,950
teeming with police and did not want to come to harm.

863
01:05:24,394 --> 01:05:25,450
Do not worry.

864
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:27,730
Thank you.

865
01:05:56,948 --> 01:05:58,192
Is anyone there?

866
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:31,419
Who's there?

867
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:27,714
Alicia.

868
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:29,521
Alicia, are you there?

869
01:07:30,744 --> 01:07:31,767
Diego?

870
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,765
Alicia, I am, open the door.

871
01:07:42,002 --> 01:07:44,343
I saw you in the hallway and run scared me, or I'm wrong?

872
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,631
Someone was in the hallway with a knife and chased.

873
01:07:50,124 --> 01:07:52,431
- He had a knife with him. - Calm.

874
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:56,299
Relax, I'm here with you, everything will be all right, calm down.

875
01:07:56,567 --> 01:07:58,334
He is overheard and left.

876
01:07:58,879 --> 01:08:00,528
Or maybe he went to another woman.

877
01:08:00,628 --> 01:08:02,462
Already Cantaloában others killed.

878
01:08:04,716 --> 01:08:06,847
I'm going to disappear selfish, but I'm worried about you only.

879
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,120
Now lie down and rest.

880
01:08:18,934 --> 01:08:20,150
Do not cry!

881
01:08:21,841 --> 01:08:25,499
I'm not leaving. I'll be up all night on the other side of the door.

882
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:26,602
All right?

883
01:08:27,384 --> 01:08:28,907
I'm not going to get hurt.

884
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,096
Thank you.

885
01:08:36,502 --> 01:08:37,885
I'll be outside.

886
01:08:40,197 --> 01:08:43,419
If you need anything, be anything ...

887
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,716
just let me know.

888
01:09:20,105 --> 01:09:22,254
Miss, return home immediately.

889
01:09:47,002 --> 01:09:48,060
Hernando!

890
01:11:14,736 --> 01:11:15,799
Do not touch

891
01:11:18,699 --> 01:11:20,022
And if he's still alive?

892
01:11:21,988 --> 01:11:23,455
Clear sting.

893
01:11:24,132 --> 01:11:26,249
The ribs 6 and 7 between.

894
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:30,913
Believe me: dead.

895
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:44,982
You leave without a farewell?

896
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:47,813
Yesterday something happened at the hotel, and you have to go to the village.

897
01:11:48,895 --> 01:11:51,067
But you're right. I'm sorry.

898
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,261
I wanted to thank the messaging thing.

899
01:11:55,262 --> 01:11:57,757
- I want to explain everything ... - I'm your friend, Alicia.

900
01:11:57,857 --> 01:11:59,711
The friends are not waiting for an explanation.

901
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:04,076
- Too bad you have to go already. - Yeah, too bad.

902
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:07,446
I came with the hope to win back his childhood love.

903
01:12:07,765 --> 01:12:10,574
- But I know it is impossible. - I'm engaged to Diego.

904
01:12:10,902 --> 01:12:12,174
No I mean it.

905
01:12:14,522 --> 01:12:15,602
Good luck!

906
01:12:45,411 --> 01:12:46,716
Decided?

907
01:12:50,863 --> 01:12:51,862
Again.

908
01:12:52,432 --> 01:12:53,454
Namely?

909
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:55,942
Last night Cantaloába I went to talk to the police.

910
01:12:56,242 --> 01:12:58,045
- What did you tell them? - The truth.

911
01:12:58,301 --> 01:13:00,213
They do not believe you, and I say it was you.

912
01:13:00,313 --> 01:13:03,572
Witness, too. One man who rushed to help your sister, she saw me.

913
01:13:04,122 --> 01:13:06,990
- You can not do this to me, Javier. - Leave me alone and I'm not saying anything.

914
01:13:07,464 --> 01:13:09,323
I did it because I love you.

915
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:11,871
You own it.

916
01:13:15,784 --> 01:13:17,228
We can be happy, Javier.

917
01:13:54,183 --> 01:13:58,975
"Dear Father! The former fiance, Javier changed my life a nightmare.

918
01:13:59,075 --> 01:14:01,429
First he cheated my sister,

919
01:14:01,529 --> 01:14:04,747
then he pushed from the balcony to get rid of him.

920
01:14:05,329 --> 01:14:06,569
I'm afraid of my father.

921
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:10,085
Javier sworn to kill me if I tell you what he did Mercedes-Nations. "

922
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:40,007
Detective Ayala ...

923
01:14:40,668 --> 01:14:41,815
Miss Alarcon.

924
01:14:42,736 --> 01:14:45,608
You do not know how much paperwork associated with a murder.

925
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:50,403
As I am now in relation to the crime.

926
01:14:51,694 --> 01:14:54,536
Do you know something that we can help the sinner?

927
01:15:04,803 --> 01:15:08,777
Last night someone chased me into the hotel hallway.

928
01:15:10,178 --> 01:15:11,577
A golden knife.

929
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:16,342
- He recognized the levy? - I do not.

930
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:24,187
So while the village guarded ... ... the killer was in the hotel.

931
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:25,401
Investigation.

932
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:28,148
Outside, waiting for the murdered girl's parents yesterday.

933
01:15:28,248 --> 01:15:30,764
I do not want them megváratni such circumstances.

934
01:15:31,054 --> 01:15:32,384
It has megbocsát, Miss Alarcon.

935
01:15:32,484 --> 01:15:34,382
- Of course. - Arrived in the mail.

936
01:15:35,655 --> 01:15:36,745
Investigation.

937
01:15:51,289 --> 01:15:53,133
Circling OLMEDO JULIO AND warrant

938
01:15:57,082 --> 01:15:58,642
I-Blancard Stewards

939
01:16:12,808 --> 01:16:16,380
"Circling and arrest warrant against Julio Olmedo, for murder.

940
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,156
Immediately they should be arrested and handed over to the judiciary. "

941
01:16:23,722 --> 01:16:24,767
The Continued ...

942
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:27,051
Alicia! You do not think I'm a murderer?

943
01:16:27,151 --> 01:16:28,151
I do not know Julio.

944
01:16:28,315 --> 01:16:31,180
Julio Espinosa stole my savings and ran away with it.

945
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,136
By the time I got back to the room, he was not there.

946
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,947
One daughter is dead, the other is unconscious, and all because of you!

947
01:16:36,963 --> 01:16:37,952
With mûvel?

948
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:41,596
What has been the beginning should have done. You will duel with me.

949
01:16:41,696 --> 01:16:42,743
What happened in Sofia?

950
01:16:42,744 --> 01:16:45,601
My mother, I know the kid who wants to give me, that of the maid.

951
01:16:45,624 --> 01:16:47,530
- I do not want that kid. - This is the time to visit?

952
01:16:47,531 --> 01:16:49,942
- That child is Diego. - I no longer need the child.

953
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:52,052
- But you said ... - Do not ever interrupt me.

954
01:16:52,352 --> 01:16:53,924
It's called the Ruta plant.

955
01:16:54,024 --> 01:16:56,827
Two spoonfuls is enough to get rid of the kid.

956
01:16:57,361 --> 01:16:59,921
Sofía, is not found in this image, neither of these.

957
01:17:00,021 --> 01:17:02,528
But why would he do that? To kill a maid?

958
01:17:02,529 --> 01:17:03,853
