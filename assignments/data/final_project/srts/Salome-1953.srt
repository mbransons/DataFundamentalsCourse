1
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,330
<i>Salomé was written by
Oscar Wilde in 1893</i>

2
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,690
<i>and it was unlike any
of his other works.</i>

3
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,770
<i>He wrote the play deliberately
in a lush and ornate style.</i>

4
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:34,690
<i>It takes place in the ancient city
of Judaea, in King Herod's palace</i>

5
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,730
<i>and all references in the play relate
to that specific biblical era.</i>

6
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,650
<i>The company of actors are
interpreting the play in modern dress,</i>

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,970
<i>but all references in the
play relate to that period,</i>

8
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,379
<i>just before the
death of Christ.</i>

9
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,050
How beautiful is the
Princess Salomé tonight!

10
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,170
Look at the moon! How
strange the moon seems.

11
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,570
She is like a woman
rising from a tomb.

12
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,610
She is like
a dead woman.

13
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,090
You would fancy she was
looking for dead things.

14
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,490
She has a strange look. She's like a
little princess who wears a yellow veil,

15
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,970
and whose feet
are of silver.

16
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,570
She is like a princess who has
little white doves for feet.

17
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,930
She is like a
woman who is dead.

18
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,650
She moves
very slowly.

19
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,330
Who are those wild
beasts howling?

20
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,410
The Jews. They are
always like that.

21
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,690
They are disputing
about their religion.

22
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,010
Why do they dispute
about their religion?

23
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,170
I cannot tell. They
are always doing it.

24
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,952
I think it is ridiculous to
dispute about such things.

25
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,530
How beautiful is the
Princess Salomé tonight!

26
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,450
You are always
looking at her.

27
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,330
You look at
her too much.

28
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,730
It is dangerous to look
at people in such fashion.

29
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,450
Something terrible
may happen.

30
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,971
She is very
beautiful tonight.

31
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,330
The Tetrarch has
a sombre look.

32
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,650
Yes, he has a
sombre look.

33
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,530
He is looking
at something.

34
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,414
He is looking
at someone.

35
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,256
At whom is
he looking?

36
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,580
I cannot tell.

37
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,730
Herodias has filled the
cup of the Tetrarch.

38
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,650
ls that the Queen Herodias? -Yes,
that is Herodias, the Tetrarch's wife.

39
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,050
After me shall come
another mightier than I.

40
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,370
I am not worthy so much as to
unloose the latchet of His shoes.

41
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,770
When He cometh, the solitary
places shall be glad.

42
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,050
They shall blossom
like the lily.

43
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,650
The eyes of the blind
shall see the day,

44
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,890
and the ears of the
deaf shall be opened.

45
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,370
The new-born child
shall put his hand...

46
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,570
Make him be silent. He is
always saying ridiculous things.

47
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,450
No, no. He is
a holy man.

48
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:46,570
He is very gentle, too. Every day,
when I give him to eat, he thanks me.

49
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,370
Who is he?
-A prophet.

50
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,610
What is his
name? -Jokanaan.

51
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,890
He came from the desert, where
he fed on locusts and wild honey.

52
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,930
A great multitude used to follow
him. He even had disciples.

53
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,650
What is he talking of? -We can never
tell. Sometimes he says terrible things,

54
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,970
but it is impossible to
understand what he says.

55
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,810
May one see him? -No. The
Tetrarch has forbidden it.

56
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,810
The Princess has hidden
her face behind her fan!

57
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,250
Her little white hands are fluttering
like doves that fly to their dove-cots.

58
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,930
They are like white butterflies.
They are just like white butterflies.

59
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,970
What is that to you?
Why do you look at her?

60
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:39,275
You must not look at her.
Something terrible may happen.

61
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,330
What a strange prison.
-It is an old cistern.

62
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,930
An old cistern. It
must be very unhealthy.

63
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,690
Oh, no! For instance, the Tetrarch's
brother, his elder brother,

64
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,810
the first husband of Herodias the Queen,
was imprisoned there for 12 years.

65
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,850
It did not kill him. At the end of
the 12 years he had to be strangled.

66
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,054
Strangled? Who
dared to do that?

67
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,050
That man yonder,
Naaman, the executioner.

68
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,730
He was not afraid? -Oh, no!
The Tetrarch sent him the ring.

69
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,810
What ring? -The death-ring.
So he was not afraid.

70
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,690
Yet it is a terrible
thing to strangle a king.

71
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,850
Why? Kings have but one
neck, like other folk.

72
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,890
I think it
terrible.

73
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,690
The Princess rises! She
is leaving the table!

74
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,530
She looks very troubled. How pale she
is! Never have I seen her so pale.

75
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,090
Do not look at her. I pray
you not to look at her.

76
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,730
She is like a dove
that has strayed.

77
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,410
She is like a narcissus
trembling in the wind.

78
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,339
She is like a
silver flower.

79
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,930
I will not stay.
I cannot stay.

80
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,170
Why does the Tetrarch
look at me all the while

81
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,690
with his mole's eyes
under his shaking eyelids?

82
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,490
It is strange that the husband of
my mother looks at me that way.

83
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:23,530
I know not what it means.
In truth, yes, I know it.

84
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,301
You have just left
the feast, Princess?

85
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,770
How sweet the air is
here! I can breathe here!

86
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,850
Inside there are
Jews from Jerusalem

87
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,290
who are tearing each other to pieces
over their foolish ceremonies,

88
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,690
and barbarians who drink and drink,
and spill their wine on the pavement,

89
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,890
and Greeks from Smyrna with
painted eyes and painted cheeks

90
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,370
and frizzed hair curled
in twisted coils,

91
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,250
and silent, subtle Egyptians, with
long nails of jade and russet cloaks,

92
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,530
and Romans brutal and coarse,
with their unoouth jargon.

93
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,330
Ah! How l loathe
the Romans!

94
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,210
They are rough and common, and they
give themselves the airs of noble lords.

95
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,410
Will you be
seated, Princess?

96
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:11,130
Why do you speak to her? Why do you look
at her? Something terrible may happen.

97
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,650
How good to see the moon! She
is like a little piece of money,

98
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,610
you would think she was
a little silver flower.

99
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,490
The moon is
cold and chaste.

100
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,290
I am sure she is a virgin,
she has a Virgin's beauty.

101
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,250
Yes, she <i>is</i> a virgin.
She has never defiled herself.

102
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,290
She has never abandoned herself
to men, like the other goddesses.

103
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:43,610
The Lord hath come. The son of
man, the son of man hath come.

104
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,290
He hath come!
He hath come!

105
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,658
The son of
man hath come.

106
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,690
Who was that who cried out?
-The prophet, Princess.

107
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:10,450
Ah, the prophet! He of whom
the Tetrarch is afraid?

108
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,610
We know nothing
of that, Princess.

109
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,810
It was the prophet
Jokanaan who cried out.

110
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,010
ls it your pleasure that I bid
them bring your litter, Princess?

111
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,610
The night is fair
in the garden.

112
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,450
He says terrible things
about my mother, does he not?

113
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,130
We never understand
what he says, Princess.

114
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,410
Yes, he says terrible
things about her.

115
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:34,170
Princess, the Tetrarch prays you return
to the feast. -I will not go back.

116
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,730
Pardon me, Princess, but if you do
not return some misfortune may happen.

117
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,690
ls he an old man,
this prophet?

118
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,170
Princess, it were better to
return. Suffer me to lead you in.

119
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,815
This prophet...

120
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,850
...is he an old man? -No,
Princess, he is quite a young man.

121
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,050
You cannot be sure. There are those
who say he is Elias. -Who is Elias?

122
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,530
A very ancient prophet of
this country, Princess.

123
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,410
What answer may I give the
Tetrarch from the Princess?

124
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,930
Rejoice not thou,
land of Palestine,

125
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,770
because the rod of him
who smote thee is broken.

126
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,370
For from the seed of the serpent
shall come forth a basilisk,

127
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,130
and that which is born of
it shall devour the birds.

128
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:24,610
What a strange voice!
I would speak with him.

129
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,810
I fear it is
impossible, Princess.

130
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,850
The Tetrarch does not wish
anyone to speak with him.

131
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,650
He has even forbidden the
high priest to speak with him.

132
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,490
I desire to speak with him.
-It is impossible, Princess.

133
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,970
I will speak with him. -Would it not
be better to return to the banquet?

134
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,370
Bring forth
this prophet!

135
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,698
We dare not,
Princess.

136
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,610
How black it is, down there! It must
be terrible to be in so black a pit!

137
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,051
It is like a tomb.

138
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,610
Did you not
hear me?

139
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,170
I said bring forth this
prophet. I wish to see him.

140
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:16,530
Princess, our lives belong to you, but
we cannot do what you have asked of us.

141
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:23,233
And indeed, it is not of us
that you should ask this thing.

142
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,213
Ah!

143
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,810
Oh! What is
going to happen?

144
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,850
I am sure that some
misfortune will happen.

145
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,650
You will do this thing for
me, Narabeth, will you not?

146
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,810
You will do this thing for me.
I have always been kind to you.

147
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,850
You will do
it for me.

148
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,850
I would but look at this strange
prophet. Men have talked so much of him.

149
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,370
Often have I heard the
Tetrarch talk of him.

150
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,460
I think the Tetrarch
is afraid of him.

151
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,770
Are you, even you, also
afraid of him, Narabeth?

152
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,050
I fear him not, Princess.
There is no man I fear.

153
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,010
But the Tetrarch has
formally forbidden

154
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,210
that any man should raise
the cover of this well.

155
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,290
You will do this thing
for me, Narabeth.

156
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,730
You know that you will
do this thing for me.

157
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,730
And tomorrow when I pass in my litter
beneath the gateway of the idol-buyers,

158
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,010
I will look at you
through the muslin veils,

159
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:27,740
I will look at you,
Narabeth, it may be...

160
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,735
...I will
smile at you.

161
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,701
Look at me,
Narabeth.

162
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,579
Look at me.

163
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,090
You know you will do
what I ask of you.

164
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,730
You know it well.

165
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,250
I know you will
do this thing.

166
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,896
Let the prophet
come forth.

167
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,570
The Princess Salomé
desires to see him.

168
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,530
Oh! How strange
the moon looks.

169
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,730
You would think it was
the hand of a dead woman

170
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,290
who is seeking to cover
herself with a shroud.

171
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,250
She has a
strange look!

172
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,410
She is like a little princess,
whose eyes are eyes of amber.

173
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:26,999
Through the clouds of muslin she
is smiling like a little princess.

174
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,890
Where is he whose cup of
abominations is now full?

175
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,930
Where is he, who in a robe
of silver shall one day die

176
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,570
in the face of
all the people?

177
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,090
Bid him come forth, that he
may hear the voice of him

178
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,770
who hath cried in the waste
places and in the houses of kings.

179
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:04,810
Of whom is he speaking? -You never
can tell, Princess. -Where is she...

180
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,690
...who gave herself unto
the Captains of Assyria,

181
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:14,610
who have baldricks on their loins and
tiaras of divers colours on their heads?

182
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,770
It is of my mother that he
speaks. -Oh, no, Princess.

183
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,370
Yes, it is of my
mother that he speaks.

184
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,090
Where is she who hath given
herself to the young men of Egypt,

185
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,930
who are clothed in fine linen and
purple, whose shields are of gold,

186
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,730
whose helmets are of silver,
whose bodies are mighty?

187
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,530
Bid her rise up from the
bed of her abominations,

188
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,970
from the bed of
her incestuousness,

189
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,010
that she may hear the words of him
who prepareth the way of the Lord,

190
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,610
that she may repent
her of her iniquities.

191
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:57,490
Though she will never repent, but
will stick fast in her abominations;

192
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,690
bid her come, for the fan
of the Lord is in His hand.

193
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,570
But he is terrible,
he is terrible.

194
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,057
Do not stay here,
Princess, I beseech you.

195
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,170
It is his eyes above
all that are terrible.

196
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,090
They are like black holes burned
by torches in a Tyrian tapestry.

197
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,210
They are like black caverns
where dragons dwell.

198
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,410
Like black caverns in Egypt in
which dragons make their lairs.

199
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:28,876
They are like black lakes
troubled by fantastic... moons.

200
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,490
Do you think he
will speak again?

201
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:38,050
Do not stay here, Princess,
I pray you, do not stay here.

202
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,570
How wasted he is! He is
like a thin ivory statue.

203
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:47,050
He is like an image of silver. I am
sure he is as chaste as the moon is.

204
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:52,050
He is like a moonbeam,
like a shaft of silver.

205
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,370
His flesh must be
cool like ivory.

206
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,410
I would look closer at
him. -No, no, Princess.

207
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,900
I must look at him closer.
-Princess! Princess!

208
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,556
Who is this woman
who is looking at me?

209
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,694
I will not have
her look at me.

210
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,970
I know not who she is. I do
not wish to know who she is.

211
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,810
Bid her begone. It is not
to her that I would speak.

212
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:36,490
I am Salomé, daughter of
Herodias, Princess of Judaea.

213
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,170
Back! Daughter
of Babylon!

214
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,890
Come not near the
chosen of the Lord.

215
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:50,570
Thy mother hath filled the earth
with the wine of her iniquities,

216
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,330
and the cry of her sins hath
come up to the ears of God.

217
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,450
Speak again, Jokanaan.
Thy voice is wine to me.

218
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,254
Princess!
Princess! Princess!

219
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,170
Speak again, Jokanaan,
tell me what I must do.

220
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,370
Daughter of Sodom,
come not near me.

221
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,690
But cover thy
face with a veil,

222
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,690
and get thee to the desert
and seek out the Son of Man.

223
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,970
Who is he, the Son of Man? ls he
as beautiful as thou are, Jokanaan?

224
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,060
Get thee
behind me!

225
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,370
I hear in the palace the beating
of the wings of the angel of death.

226
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,610
Princess, I beseech
thee to go within.

227
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,170
Angel of the Lord God, what
dost thou here with thy sword?

228
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,010
The day of him who shall die in a
robe of silver has not yet come.

229
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,330
Jokanaan! Jokanaan, I
am amorous of thy body!

230
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,010
Thy body is white like the lilies of a
field that the mower hath never mowed.

231
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,530
Thy body is white like the
snows in the mountains of Judea,

232
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,970
that come down
into the valleys.

233
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:06,690
The roses in the garden of the Queen
of Arabia are not so white as thy body.

234
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,010
There is nothing in the
world so white as thy body.

235
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:18,410
Let me touch thy body.
-Back. Daughter of Babylon.

236
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,930
By woman came evil into
the world. Speak not to me.

237
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,610
I will not
listen to thee.

238
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:32,518
I listen but to the voice,
the voice of the Lord God.

239
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:39,850
Thy body is hideous. It is
like the body of a leper.

240
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,890
It is like a plastered wall
where vipers have crawled.

241
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,530
It is like a plastered wall where
the scorpions have made their nest.

242
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,210
It is like a whitened sepulchre
full of loathsome things.

243
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,061
It is horrible, thy
body is horrible.

244
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,730
It is thy mouth that
I desire, Jokanaan.

245
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:11,730
Thy mouth is like a band of
scarlet on a tower of ivory.

246
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,890
It is like a pomegranate
cut with a knife of ivory.

247
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,810
The pomegranate flowers that
blossom in the garden of Tyre,

248
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:25,090
and are redder than
roses, are not so red.

249
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,490
The red blasts of trumpets that
herald the approach of kings,

250
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,579
and make afraid the
enemy, are not so red.

251
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,570
Thy mouth is redder
than the feet of those

252
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,970
who tread the wine
in the wine press.

253
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,970
Thy mouth is redder
than the feet of doves

254
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,930
who haunt the temples and
are fed by the priests.

255
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,690
It is redder than the feet of
him who oometh from a forest

256
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:59,330
where he hath slain a lion
and seen gilded tigers.

257
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:04,610
Thy mouth is like a branch of
coral that fishers have found

258
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,330
in the twilight
of the sea,

259
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,290
the coral that they
keep for the kings!

260
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:17,290
It is the vermilion that the
Moabites find in the mines of Moab,

261
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,610
the vermilion that the
kings take from them.

262
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,010
It is the bow of the
King of the Persians...

263
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,250
...that is painted
with vermilion

264
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:37,378
and is tipped
with... coral.

265
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,330
There is nothing
in the world

266
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,819
so red... as
thy mouth.

267
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,770
Let me kiss
thy mouth.

268
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:02,679
Never! Daughter of Babylon.
Daughter of Sodom. Never!

269
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,690
I will kiss thy mouth,
Jokanaan. I will kiss thy mouth.

270
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,770
Princess, Princess, thou who
art like a garden of myrrh,

271
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,890
thou who are the dove of all doves,
look not at this man, look not at him!

272
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,730
Do not speak such words to
him. I cannot suffer them!

273
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,570
Princess, Princess, do
not speak these things.

274
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,970
I will kiss thy mouth,
Jokanaan. -No, no!

275
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,252
The young Syrian
has slain himself!

276
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,250
The young captain
has slain himself!

277
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:56,450
He has slain himself
who was my friend!

278
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:03,881
Princess, the young captain
has just killed himself.

279
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,410
Let me kiss
thy mouth.

280
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,450
Daughter of adultery, there
is but one who can save thee,

281
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,290
it is He of whom I
spake. Go seek Him.

282
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:22,130
He is on a boat on the sea of Galilee,
and He talketh with His disciples.

283
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,570
Kneel down on the shore of the
sea, and call unto Him by His name.

284
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:33,090
When He cometh to thee, and to
all who call on Him, He cometh,

285
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:39,810
bow thyself at His feet and ask
of Him the remission of thy sins.

286
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,695
Let me kiss
thy mouth!

287
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:51,090
I will kiss thy mouth,
Jokanaan. I will kiss thy mouth.

288
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,839
Thou art accursed,
Salomé, thou art accursed.

289
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,130
We must bear away the
body to another place.

290
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,970
The Tetrarch does not
care to see dead bodies,

291
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,810
save the bodies of those
whom he himself has slain.

292
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,690
You are right, we must hide the
body. The Tetrarch must not see it.

293
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,730
The Tetrarch will not come to this
place. He never comes on the terrace.

294
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,490
He is too much afraid
of the prophet.

295
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:30,421
Salomé. Where
is Salomé?

296
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,250
Where is the
Princess?

297
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:42,650
Why did she not return to the
banquet as I commanded her?

298
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,330
Ah! There she is!

299
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:53,316
You must not look at her! You
are always looking at her!

300
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:04,770
The moon has a strange look
tonight. Has she not a strange look?

301
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:12,450
She is like a mad woman, a mad woman
who is seeking everywhere for lovers.

302
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,410
She is naked, too.

303
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,570
She is,
quite naked.

304
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,770
The clouds are seeking to clothe her
nakedness, but she will not let them.

305
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:29,259
She shows herself
naked in the sky.

306
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,090
I am sure she is
looking for lovers.

307
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,930
Does she not reel
like a drunken woman?

308
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,090
She is like a mad
woman, is she not?

309
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,420
No, the moon is like
the moon, that is all.

310
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,636
Let us go within. You
have nothing to do here.

311
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,220
I will stay here!

312
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,610
Manasseh, lay
carpets there.

313
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:09,570
Light torches, bring forth the ivory
tables, and the tables of jasper.

314
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,570
The air here is delicious. I will
drink more wine with my guests.

315
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:20,370
We must show all honours to
the ambassadors of Caesar.

316
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,330
It is not because of them that you
remain. -Oh yes, the air is delicious.

317
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:32,058
Come, Herodias, our
guests await us.

318
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,892
I have slipped.

319
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,810
I have slipped in blood!
That is an ill omen.

320
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,490
That is a very evil omen.
Wherefore is there blood here?

321
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,130
And this body, what
does this body here?

322
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,290
Think you that I am like the King of
Egypt, who gives no feast to his guests

323
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,370
but that he shows
them a corpse?

324
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,290
Whose is it? I will not look on
it. -It is our captain, sire.

325
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,530
He is the young Syrian whom you
made captain only three days ago.

326
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,850
I gave no order that
he should be slain.

327
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,290
He killed himself, sire.
-He killed himself?

328
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,370
For what reason? I
made him my captain.

329
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,850
We do not know, sire.
But he killed himself.

330
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,050
That seems
strange to me.

331
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,370
I thought it was only the Roman
philosophers who killed themselves.

332
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,930
ls that not true, Tigellinus, that
the philosophers kill themselves?

333
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,090
They are
the Stoics.

334
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,090
It is strange that the young
Syrian has killed himself.

335
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,050
I am sorry he has
killed himself.

336
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,890
I am very sorry, for he
was fair to look upon.

337
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,050
He was, even
very fair.

338
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,730
He had very
languorous eyes.

339
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,930
I remember I saw that he
looked languorously at Salomé.

340
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,290
Truly, I thought he
looked too much at her.

341
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,370
There are others who
look at her too much.

342
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,450
His father was a king. I
drove him from his kingdom.

343
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,850
And you made a slave of his
mother, who was a queen, Herodias.

344
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,730
So he was here as my
guest, as it were,

345
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,410
and for that reason,
I made him my captain.

346
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,658
I am sorry
he is dead.

347
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:18,471
Ho! Why have you left the body here?
Away with it. I will not look on it.

348
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,370
Ah! It is
cold here.

349
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,770
There is a wind blowing.
ls there not wind blowing?

350
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:34,370
No, there is no wind. -I say
there is a wind that blows.

351
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:40,450
And I hear in the air something
like the beating of wings,

352
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,250
like the beating
of vast wings.

353
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,817
Do you not hear it?
-I hear nothing.

354
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,658
I hear it no longer.
But I heard it.

355
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,770
It was the blowing of the wind,
no doubt. It has passed away.

356
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:04,130
I hear it again. Do you not hear
it? Just like the beating of wings.

357
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,010
I tell you there is nothing.
You are ill. Let us go within.

358
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,780
I am not ill. It is your
daughter who is sick.

359
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:21,770
She has the mien of a sick person.
Never have I seen her so pale.

360
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,770
I have told you
not to look at her.

361
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,301
Pour me
forth wine.

362
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,890
Salomé, drink a
little wine with me.

363
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:38,690
I have here a wine that is
exquisite. Caesar himself sent it me.

364
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:43,570
Dip into it thy little red
lips, that I may drain the cup.

365
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,130
I am not thirsty,
Tetrarch.

366
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,850
You see how she answers
me, this daughter of yours?

367
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:53,650
She does right. Why are
you always gazing at her?

368
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,410
Bring me
ripe fruits.

369
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:01,615
Salomé, come, eat
fruit with me.

370
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,530
I love to see in a fruit the
mark of thy little teeth.

371
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:16,530
Bite but a little of this fruit
and then I will eat what is left.

372
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,210
I am not hungry,
Tetrarch.

373
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,850
You see how you have brought
up this daughter of yours?

374
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,050
My daughter and I
come of a royal race.

375
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,010
As for thee, thy father was a
camel driver! He was also a robber!

376
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,290
Thou liest! -Thou
knowest well it is true.

377
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,850
Salomé, come sit next to me. I will
give thee the throne of thy mother.

378
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,530
I am not tired,
Tetrarch.

379
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,573
You see what she
thinks of you.

380
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,370
Bring me... what?

381
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,857
What is it I
desire? I forgot.

382
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,970
Ah! Yes, I
remember.

383
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,530
Lo!

384
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:09,090
The time is come! That which
I foretold has come to pass...

385
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,730
...saith the
Lord God.

386
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,290
The day of
which I spoke.

387
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,290
The Lord has come. The
Son of Man has some.

388
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,570
Command him to be silent. I
will not listen to his voice.

389
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,610
This man is forever
vomiting insults against me.

390
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:32,250
He has said nothing against you.
Besides, he is a very great prophet.

391
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,930
I do not believe
in prophets.

392
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:39,170
Can a man tell what will come
to pass? No man knows it.

393
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,530
Moreover, he is for
ever insulting me.

394
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,930
But I think you are afraid of him.
I know well you are afraid of him.

395
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,970
I am not afraid of him.
I am afraid of no man.

396
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,130
I tell you, you
are afraid of him.

397
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,090
If you are not afraid of him, why
do you not deliver him to the Jews,

398
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,850
who for these six months past
who have been clamouring for him?

399
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,930
Truly, my lord, it were better
to deliver him into our hands.

400
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,970
Yes, my lord. -Enough on this subject.
I've already given you my answer.

401
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,970
I will not deliver
him into your hands.

402
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,530
He is a holy man. He is
a man who has seen God.

403
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,650
That cannot be. There is no man who
hath seen God since the prophet Elias.

404
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,810
God is at no
time hidden.

405
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,690
He showeth himself at all
times and in everything.

406
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,170
God is in what is evil, even
as he is in what is good.

407
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,370
That is a very
dangerous doctrine.

408
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,050
No one can tell how God worketh.
His ways are very mysterious.

409
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,410
It may be that things which
we call evil are good,

410
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,410
and the things which
we call good are evil.

411
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,170
We must needs submit to
everything, for God is very strong.

412
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,370
Very strong. -He breaketh in pieces
the strong together with the weak,

413
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,290
for he regardeth
not any man.

414
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,250
Truly God is terrible, he
breaketh the strong and the weak

415
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,530
as a man brays corn in a mortar.
But this man hath never seen God.

416
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,170
No man hath seen God
since the prophet Elias.

417
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,970
So the day is come,
the day of the Lord.

418
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,610
And I hear... I hear
upon the mountains

419
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,132
the feet of Him
who shall be...

420
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,579
...the saviour
of the world.

421
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,170
What does
that mean?

422
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,130
Saviour of the world.
What does that mean?

423
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,610
It is a title
that Caesar takes.

424
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,730
But Caesar is not
coming into Judaea.

425
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,890
Only yesterday I received
letters from Rome.

426
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,010
They contained nothing
concerning this matter.

427
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,890
And you, Tigellinus, who were
at Rome during the winter,

428
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,610
you heard nothing concerning
this matter, did you?

429
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,810
Sire, I heard nothing concerning the
matter. I was explaining the title.

430
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,650
It is one of
Caesar's titles.

431
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,930
But Caesar
cannot come.

432
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,410
He is too gouty.

433
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,730
They say that his feet are
like the feet of an elephant.

434
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,330
Also, there are
reasons of State.

435
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:09,730
He who leaves Rome loses
Rome. He will not come.

436
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:15,050
Albeit, Caesar is lord,
he will come if he wishes.

437
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,850
Nevertheless, I do not
think that he will come.

438
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,570
It was not concerning Caesar that
the prophet spake these words, sire.

439
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,650
Not of Caesar?
-No, sire.

440
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,770
Concerning whom
then did he speak?

441
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,975
Concerning Messias
who has come.

442
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,290
This man worketh
true miracles.

443
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,490
Thus, at a marriage which took
place in a little town of Galilee,

444
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,650
a town of some importance,
he changed water into wine.

445
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,010
And he was seen on a
mountain talking with angels.

446
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,810
Angels do
not exist!

447
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,370
Angels exist, but I do not believe
this man has talked with them.

448
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,890
He was seen by a great multitude
of people talking with angels.

449
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,730
Not with angels. -How these men
weary me! They are ridiculous!

450
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,490
There is also the miracle
of the daughter of Jairus.

451
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,610
Yes, that is sure. No
man can gainsay it.

452
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,890
These men are mad. They have
looked too long on the moon.

453
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,138
Command them
to be silent.

454
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,570
What is the miracle of
the daughter of Jairus?

455
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:26,530
The daughter of Jairus was dead.
He raised her from the dead.

456
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:32,374
He raises the dead? -Yes,
sire, he raiseth the dead.

457
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,530
I do not wish
him to do that.

458
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,010
I forbid him
to do that.

459
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,810
I allow no man to
raise the dead.

460
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:48,570
This man must be found and told
I forbid him to raise the dead.

461
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,770
Where is this man at present? -It
is said that he is now in Samaria.

462
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:56,690
It is easy to see that this is
not Messias, if he is in Samaria.

463
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,850
It is not to the
Samaritans... -No matter!

464
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,050
Let them find him,
and tell him from me,

465
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,610
I will not allow him
to raise the dead!

466
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,620
To change water
into wine...

467
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,410
...to heal the
lepers and the blind.

468
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,010
He may do these things if he will.
I say nothing against these things.

469
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,730
In truth I hold it a good
deed to heal a leper.

470
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,410
But I allow no man
to raise the dead.

471
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,930
It would be terrible
if the dead came back.

472
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,810
Wanton!
You harlot!

473
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:45,490
Daughter of Babylon with her golden
eyes under her gilded eyelids!

474
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,570
Let there come against
her a multitude of men.

475
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,210
Let the people
take stones

476
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,570
and stone her! -Command
him to be silent.

477
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,050
Let the war captains pierce
her with their swords.

478
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,010
Nay, but it
is infamous.

479
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:03,570
It is thus that I will wipe out
all wickedness from the earth,

480
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,450
and that all
women shall learn

481
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,010
not to imitate
her abominations.

482
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:15,170
You hear what he says against me?
You allow him to revile your wife?

483
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,490
He did not
speak your name.

484
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,850
What does that matter? You know well
that it is I whom he seeks to revile.

485
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,290
And I am your
wife, am I not?

486
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,970
Of a truth, dear and noble
Herodias, you are my wife,

487
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,450
and before that you were
the wife of my brother.

488
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,250
It was you who tore
me from his arms.

489
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,930
Of a truth, I
was stronger.

490
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,850
But let us not speak of that matter.
I do not desire to speak of it.

491
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,290
It is the cause of the terrible
words that the prophet has spoken.

492
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:48,290
Peradventure on account of
it a misfortune will come.

493
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,810
Let us not speak
of that matter.

494
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,370
Come, Herodias, we are
not mindful of our guests.

495
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,530
Fill thou my cup,
my well-beloved.

496
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,570
Fill with wine the great goblets of
silver, and the great goblets of glass.

497
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:11,290
I will drink to Caesar. There are
Romans here, we must drink to Caesar.

498
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:16,110
Caesar!
Caesar!

499
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,290
Caesar!

500
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,690
Do you see your daughter,
how pale she is?

501
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,370
What is it to you whether
she be pale or not?

502
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,530
Never have I
seen her so pale.

503
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,210
You must not
look at her.

504
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:37,490
In that day the sun shall become
black like the sackcloth of hair,

505
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,370
and the moon shall
become like blood,

506
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,370
and the stars of the heavens shall
fall upon the earth like ripe figs

507
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,530
that fall from
the fig tree.

508
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,890
And the kings of the
earth shall be afraid.

509
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,210
I should like to see that
day of which he speaks,

510
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,930
when the moon shall
become like blood,

511
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,730
and the stars shall fall upon
the earth like ripe figs.

512
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,010
This prophet talks
like a drunken man.

513
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,130
But I cannot suffer
the sound of his voice.

514
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,930
I hate his voice.
Command him to be silent.

515
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,655
I will not.

516
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:21,570
I cannot understand what it is that
he saith, but it may be an omen.

517
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,930
Oh! I do not believe in omens.
He speaks like a drunken man.

518
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,370
It may be that he is drunk
with the wine of God.

519
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,410
What wine is that,
the wine of God?

520
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,810
From what vineyards is it gathered?
In what wine-press may one find it?

521
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,970
Tigellinus, when you
were at Rome of late,

522
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:47,400
did the Emperor speak
with you on the subject?

523
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:59,056
On what
subject, sire?

524
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,694
On what subject?

525
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:08,420
Ah! I asked you a
question, did I not?

526
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,490
I have forgotten what
I would have asked you.

527
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,690
You are looking
again at my daughter.

528
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,970
You must not look at her.
I have already said so.

529
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,980
You say nothing else.
-I say it again.

530
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:26,290
And the restoration of the Temple
about which they have talked so much,

531
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,970
will anything
be done?

532
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,530
They say that the veil of the
Sanctuary has disappeared, do they not?

533
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,450
It was thyself
didst steal it.

534
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:40,290
Thou speakest at random. I will
not stay here. Let us go within.

535
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,413
Dance for
me, Salomé.

536
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,210
I will not
have her dance.

537
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,690
I have no desire
to dance, Tetrarch.

538
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:54,690
Salomé, daughter of
Herodias, dance for me.

539
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,574
Let her alone.

540
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:04,250
Salomé, I command
thee to dance.

541
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,170
I will not
dance, Tetrarch.

542
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:12,730
You see how
she obeys you.

543
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,490
What is it to me whether she
dance or not? It is naught to me.

544
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:22,250
Tonight I am happy,
I am passing happy.

545
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,850
Never have I
been so happy.

546
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:28,530
The Tetrarch has a sombre
look. Has he not a sombre look?

547
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,370
Yes, he has a
sombre look.

548
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,010
He shall be seated
on his throne.

549
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,730
He shall be clothed
in scarlet and purple.

550
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:41,570
In his hand he shall bear a golden
cup full of his blasphemies.

551
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,770
And the angel of the
Lord shall smite him.

552
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:49,290
He shall be
eaten of worms.

553
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:55,370
You hear what he says about you.
He says you will be eaten of worms.

554
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:01,810
It is not of me that he speaks. It is of
the King of Cappadocia that he speaks;

555
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,970
the King of Cappadocia,
who is my enemy.

556
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:08,290
It is he who shall be eaten
of worms. It is not I.

557
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,890
Never has he spoken word
against me, this prophet,

558
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,570
save that I sinned in taking
to wife the wife of my brother.

559
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:22,930
It may be that he is right. For,
of a truth, you are sterile.

560
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,090
I am sterile, I?

561
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,130
You say that, you that are
ever looking at my daughter,

562
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,010
you that would have her
dance for your pleasure?

563
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,330
It is absurd to say that.
I have borne a child.

564
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,170
You have gotten no child, no,
not even from one of your slaves.

565
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,330
It is you who are
sterile, not I.

566
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,130
Peace, woman! I say
you are sterile.

567
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,330
You have borne
me no child,

568
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,570
and the prophet says that our
marriage is not a true marriage.

569
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:58,170
He says it is an
incestuous marriage,

570
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,010
a marriage that
will bring evils.

571
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:06,610
I fear he is right, I am
sure that he is right.

572
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,370
But this is not the moment
to speak of such things.

573
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,450
I would be happy
at this moment.

574
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,490
Indeed, I
am happy.

575
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,490
Never have I
been so happy.

576
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,930
There is
nothing I lack.

577
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:27,850
I am glad you are of so fair a humour
tonight. It is not your custom.

578
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:33,490
But it is late. Let us go within. Do
not forget that we hunt at sunrise.

579
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:38,650
All honours must be paid to
Caesar's ambassadors, must they not?

580
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:44,250
Salomé, Salomé, dance for
me. I pray you, dance for me.

581
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:52,130
I am sad tonight. I am
passing sad tonight.

582
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,970
When I came hither I slipped in
blood, which is an evil omen,

583
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:02,050
also I heard, I am sure I heard
in the air a beating of wings,

584
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,410
the beating of
giant wings.

585
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,770
I cannot tell
what they mean.

586
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:15,210
Therefore dance for me. I pray you,
Salomé, I beseech you, dance for me.

587
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:19,090
Salomé, if you
dance for me,

588
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,850
you may ask of
me what you will,

589
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:30,210
and I will give it to you, even
unto the half of my kingdom.

590
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:34,450
Will you indeed give me
whatsoever I shall ask, Tetrarch?

591
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,130
Do not dance,
my daughter.

592
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,813
Everything, even the
half of my kingdom.

593
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,139
You swear
it, Tetrarch?

594
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,094
I swear
it, Salomé.

595
00:43:54,350 --> 00:44:01,610
By what will you swear, Tetrarch?
-By my life, by my crown, by my gods.

596
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:08,210
Whatsoever you desire I will give it to
you, even unto the half of my kingdom,

597
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,570
if you will but
dance for me.

598
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:17,970
O, Salomé, Salomé,
dance for me!

599
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:20,570
You have sworn,
Tetrarch.

600
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,770
I have sworn,
Salomé.

601
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,770
My daughter,
do not dance.

602
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:31,452
Thou wilt be passing
fair as queen,...

603
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:38,570
...Salomé, if it please thee to
ask for the half of my kingdom.

604
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,738
Will she not be
fair as queen?

605
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,615
It is cold here!
There is an icy wind.

606
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:03,810
And I hear in the air, wherefore do I
hear in the air this beating of wings?

607
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,810
One might
fancy a bird,

608
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:13,730
a huge black bird that
hovers over the terrace.

609
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:19,650
Why can I not see it, this bird?
The beat of its wings is terrible.

610
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,130
The breath of the wind
of its wings is terrible.

611
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,610
It is a chill wind. Nay, but
it is not cold, it is hot.

612
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,170
I am choking.

613
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:37,890
Pour water on my hands.
Give me snow to eat.

614
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,570
Loosen my mantle. Quick!
Quick! Loosen my mantle.

615
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:47,010
Nay, leave it! It is my garland
that hurts me, my garland of roses.

616
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:52,280
The flowers are like fire.
They burn my forehead.

617
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:27,570
I can breathe now. How
red those rose petals are.

618
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,535
They are like stains
of blood on the cloth.

619
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:39,770
That does not matter. You must not
find symbols in everything you see.

620
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:43,621
It makes life
impossible.

621
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:50,210
It were better to say that stains of
blood are as lovely as rose petals.

622
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,370
It were better
far to say that.

623
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:02,317
But we will not speak
of this. Now I am happy.

624
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:08,972
I am...
passing happy!

625
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:13,890
Have I not a right to be happy? Your
daughter is going to dance for me.

626
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:18,170
Will you not dance for me, Salomé?
You have promised to dance for me.

627
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,930
I will not
have her dance.

628
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,250
I will dance for
you, Tetrarch.

629
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:30,290
You hear what your daughter says?
She is going to dance for me.

630
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,770
You do well to dance
for me, Salomé.

631
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:39,970
And once you have danced for me, forget
not to ask of me whatsoever you will.

632
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:47,450
Whatsoever you will I will give it
you, even unto the half of my kingdom.

633
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,010
I have sworn it, have I not?
-You have sworn it, Tetrarch.

634
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:56,290
And I have never broken my word. I am
not of those who break their oaths.

635
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,970
I know not how to lie.
I am a slave to my word,

636
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:04,370
and my word is the
word of a king.

637
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,610
The King of Cappadocia
always lies...

638
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,850
...but he is no true
king. He is a coward.

639
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:17,050
Also, he owes me money
he will not repay.

640
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:21,970
He has insulted my ambassadors. He
has spoken words that were wounding.

641
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,890
But Caesar will crucify
him when he comes to Rome.

642
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:29,010
I am sure Caesar
will crucify him.

643
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:34,530
Yet will he die, if not,
being eaten of worms.

644
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:39,410
The prophet prophesied it. Well,
Salome, wherefore dost thou tarry?

645
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,850
I am waiting until my
slaves bring perfumes to me

646
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:49,370
and the seven veils,
and take off my sandals.

647
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:54,575
Ah, you are going to
dance with naked feet.

648
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,930
'Tis well! Oh, 'tis
well. Your little feet.

649
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,690
Your little feet will
be like white doves.

650
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:08,090
They will be like little white
flowers that dance upon the trees.

651
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,370
No, no, she's going to dance on blood.
There is blood spilt on the ground.

652
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:15,410
She must not dance on
blood. It were an evil omen.

653
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:19,570
What is it to you whether
she dance on blood or not?

654
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:23,690
Thou has waded deep
enough therein.

655
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:28,570
What is it to me?
Ah! Look at the moon!

656
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:33,090
She has
become red.

657
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:39,410
She has become red as blood.
The prophet prophesied truly.

658
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:45,090
He prophesied that the moon would
become red as blood. Do ye not see it?

659
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,770
Oh, yes, I
see it well,

660
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:52,610
and the stars are falling
like ripe figs, are they not?

661
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,770
And the sun has become black
like a sackcloth of hair,

662
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:59,410
and the kings of the
earth are afraid.

663
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:03,010
That at least one can see. The prophet,
for once in his life, was right,

664
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,292
the kings of the
earth are afraid.

665
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:12,730
Let us go within. You are sick. They
will say at Rome that you are mad.

666
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:14,970
Let us go within,
I tell you.

667
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:21,170
Who is this who cometh from Edom,
who is this who oometh from Bozra,

668
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:25,250
whose raiment is
dyed with purple,

669
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:30,690
who shineth in the beauty of his
garments, who walketh mighty?

670
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,690
It is the Lord!

671
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:37,930
Let us go within! The voice
of that man maddens me!

672
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,050
I will not have my daughter dance
while he is continually crying out.

673
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,730
I will not have her dance while
you look at her in such a fashion.

674
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,330
In a word, I will
not have her dance.

675
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:53,450
Do not rise, my wife, my queen,
it will avail thee nothing.

676
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,654
I will not go within
till she hath danced.

677
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:05,250
Dance, Salomé,
dance for me.

678
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:10,455
My daughter,
do not dance.

679
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,974
I am ready,
Tetrarch.

680
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,450
Wonderful!

681
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,218
Wonderful!

682
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:10,431
You see, she has danced
for me, your daughter.

683
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:28,210
Come near,
Salomé,

684
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,493
come near, that I may
give you your reward.

685
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:38,010
I pay the dancers well.
I shall pay thee royally.

686
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:45,370
I shall give thee whatsoever
thy soul desireth.

687
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,301
What wouldst
thou have?

688
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,770
Speak.

689
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,610
I would that they presently
bring me in a silver charger...

690
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,495
In a silver
charger?

691
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,570
Surely yes, in a
silver charger.

692
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,659
She is charming,
is she not?

693
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,250
But what would you have them bring you
in a silver charger? Tell me the thing.

694
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:20,290
Whatsoever it may be, I will give
it you. My treasures belong to thee.

695
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,094
What is
it, Salomé?

696
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:31,410
The head of
Jokanaan.

697
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,410
That is well
said, my daughter.

698
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:39,456
No, no, Salomé. You
do not ask me that.

699
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,890
Do not listen to
your mother's voice.

700
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:46,130
She is ever giving you evil
counsel. Do not heed her.

701
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:49,690
I do not heed my mother. It is
for my own pleasure that I ask

702
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,970
for the head of Jokanaan
on a silver charger.

703
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:55,970
You have sworn, Tetrarch. Forget
not that you have sworn an oath.

704
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:01,010
I know. I have sworn by
my gods. I know it well.

705
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:05,330
But I pray you, Salomé,
ask of me something else.

706
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,170
Ask of me the half of my
kingdom, and I will give it you.

707
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,370
But ask not of me what you have asked.
-I ask of you the head of Jokanaan.

708
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:18,930
No, no, I do not wish it.
-You have sworn, Herod.

709
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,890
Yes, you have sworn. Everybody
heard you. You swore it...

710
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:25,050
Be silent! It is
not to you I speak.

711
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,370
Oh, my daughter does well
to ask the head of Jokanaan.

712
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:32,410
He has covered me with insults. He
has said monstrous things against me.

713
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,650
One can see she loves
her mother well.

714
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:39,170
Do not yield, my daughter.
He has sworn, he has sworn.

715
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:43,180
Be silent,
speak not to me!

716
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:50,970
Come, Salomé, be reasonable.
I have never been hard to you.

717
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:55,170
I have ever loved you. It may be
that I have loved you too much.

718
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:58,530
Therefore ask not
this thing of me.

719
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:04,010
This is a terrible thing. This
is an awful thing to ask of me.

720
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,170
Surely, I think that
you are jesting.

721
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:11,490
The head of a man that
is cut from his body...

722
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,050
...is ill to look
upon, is it not?

723
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:21,530
It is not meet that the eyes of a
virgin should look upon such a thing.

724
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:27,930
What pleasure can you
have in it? None. No, no.

725
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,250
Harken to me. I
have an emerald,

726
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:35,050
a great round emerald, which
Caesar's minion sent me.

727
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,530
When you look
through this emerald,

728
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:41,210
you can see things which
happen at great distance.

729
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:45,250
Caesar himself carries such an
emerald when he goes to the circus.

730
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:50,250
Only my emerald is larger.
I know well it is larger.

731
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,090
It is the largest emerald
in the whole world.

732
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:57,250
You would like
that, would you not?

733
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:01,290
Ask it of me, I
will give it you.

734
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,410
I demand the
head of Jokanaan.

735
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,970
You are not listening.
Salomé, you are not listening.

736
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,250
Suffer me to speak.
The head of Jokanaan.

737
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:14,170
No, no, you would
not have that.

738
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:20,330
You say that to trouble me, because I
have looked at you all this evening.

739
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:27,010
It is true, I have looked at
you. Your beauty troubled me.

740
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:32,930
Your beauty has grievously troubled
me, and I have looked at you too much.

741
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,930
But I will look
at you no more.

742
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:41,770
Neither at things, nor at
people should one look.

743
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:49,952
Only in mirrors should one look,
for mirrors do but show us masks.

744
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:53,816
Ah! Bring
wine! I thirst.

745
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:57,050
Salomé, come let
us be friends.

746
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:03,321
What would I say? What was
it? I've forgotten. Ah, yes!

747
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:12,395
Nay but come nearer, Salomé,
I fear you will not hear me.

748
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:20,650
You know my white peacocks,
my beautiful white peacocks,

749
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:25,690
that walk in the garden between the
myrtles and the tall cypress trees.

750
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,650
Their beaks are gilded with gold,
and the grains that they eat

751
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:35,250
are gilded with gold also and
their feet are stained with purple.

752
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:39,090
When they cry out
the rain comes,

753
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:44,410
and the moon shows herself in the
heavens when they spread their tails.

754
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,690
Two by two they
walk in the garden

755
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:50,850
between the black myrtles
and the cypress trees,

756
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:54,293
and each has a
slave to tend it.

757
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,850
I will give them all to
you. I have but a hundred.

758
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:02,210
Only you must loose
me from my oath.

759
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:06,690
You must not ask of me that
which you have asked of me.

760
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:09,530
I demand the
head of Jokanaan.

761
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:14,530
Well said, my daughter! As for you,
you are ridiculous with your peacocks.

762
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:17,937
Be silent!

763
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:24,770
You cry out always, you cry
out like a beast of prey.

764
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:28,177
You must not!

765
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,131
Your voice...

766
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:38,090
...wearies me.

767
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:40,530
Be silent, I say.

768
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:51,178
Salomé, think of
what you are doing.

769
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:54,930
This man comes
perchance from God.

770
01:00:55,030 --> 01:01:00,450
He is a holy man. The finger
of God has touched him.

771
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:05,490
God has put into his
mouth terrible words.

772
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:10,050
In the palace, as in the
desert, God is always with him.

773
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:13,290
At least it is possible.
One does not know.

774
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:17,770
It is possible that God
is for him and with him.

775
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:25,410
Furthermore, if he died, a
misfortune might happen to me.

776
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:28,970
In any case, he said
that the day he dies,

777
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:34,010
a misfortune will happen to
someone. That could only be me.

778
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,450
Remember, I slipped in
blood when I entered.

779
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:40,330
Also, I heard in the air
the beating of wings,

780
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,770
the beating of
giant wings.

781
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,650
These are very evil omens,
and there were others.

782
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:51,450
I am sure there were others,
though I did not see them.

783
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:58,130
Salomé, you do not wish a
misfortune to happen to me?

784
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:02,970
You do not wish that.
Then listen to me.

785
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,730
Give me the head
of Jokanaan!

786
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:09,010
Ah! You are not
listening. Be calm.

787
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:11,850
Be calm.

788
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,650
I am calm.

789
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:19,570
I am quite
calm. Listen.

790
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:25,210
I have jewels hidden
in this place,

791
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:28,050
jewels that
are marvellous.

792
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:32,410
I have a collar of
pearls, set in four rows

793
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:36,570
that are like unto moons
chained with rays of silver.

794
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,490
They are like 50 moons
caught in a golden net.

795
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:43,010
On the ivory of her breast,
a queen has worn it.

796
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:47,930
Thou shalt be as fair as a queen
when thou wearest it, Salomé.

797
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:52,090
I have topazes, yellow as
are the eyes of tigers.

798
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:57,570
I have opals that burn
always, with an icelike flame,

799
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:02,290
opals that make sad men's minds,
and are fearful of the shadows.

800
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:06,130
I have sapphires
big like eggs

801
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:11,530
and blue as blue flowers.
The sea wanders within them

802
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:15,530
and the moon comes never to
trouble the blue of their waves.

803
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:22,450
I have chrysolites and beryls
and chrysoprases and rubies.

804
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:27,530
I have sardonyx and hyacinth
stone, stone of chalcedony,

805
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:33,890
and I will give them all to you,
and other things will I add to them.

806
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:37,450
The King of the Indies
has but even now

807
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:43,170
sent me four fans fashioned
from the feathers of parrots,

808
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:48,610
and the King of Numidia, a
garment of ostrich feathers.

809
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:54,330
I have a crystal into which it is
not lawful for a woman to look,

810
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:59,490
nor may young men behold it till
they have been beaten with rods.

811
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:04,450
In a coffer of nacre, I have
three wondrous turquoises.

812
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:09,770
He who wears them on his forehead
can imagine things which are not,

813
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:18,511
and he who carries them in his
hand can make women sterile.

814
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:25,690
These are great treasures, Salome,
these are treasures above all price.

815
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:30,290
These are treasures
without price.

816
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:33,618
But this
is not all.

817
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:37,690
In an ebony
coffer,

818
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:44,610
I have two cups of amber,
that are like apples of gold.

819
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:52,713
If an enemy pour poison into these cups,
they become like an apple of silver.

820
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:57,970
In a coffer
encrusted with amber,

821
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:02,410
I have sandals
encrusted with glass.

822
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:08,890
I have mantles brought here
from the land of the Seres,

823
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:14,010
bracelets decked about with
carbuncles and with jade

824
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:18,010
that comes from the
city of Euphrates.

825
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:21,690
What desirest thou
more than this, Salomé?

826
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:26,370
Tell me the thing that thou
desirest, and I will give it thee.

827
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:35,839
All that thou askest I will
give thee, save one thing.

828
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:42,620
I will give thee
all that is mine...

829
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:48,099
...save one life.

830
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:58,370
I will give thee the
mantle of the high priest.

831
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:03,336
I will give thee the
veil of the sanctuary.

832
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:15,054
Give me the head
of Jokanaan.

833
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:57,014
Let her be given
what she asks.

834
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:04,850
For of a truth she is
her mother's child.

835
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:11,654
Who has taken
my ring?

836
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,979
There was a ring
on my right hand.

837
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:21,495
Who has drunk
my wine?

838
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:28,650
There was wine in my
cup. It was full of wine.

839
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,932
Someone has
drunk it.

840
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:39,690
Surely some evil
will befall someone.

841
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:46,016
Wherefore did
I give my oath?

842
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:51,577
Kings ought never to
pledge their word.

843
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:56,455
For if they keep it
not, it is terrible...

844
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,810
...and if they keep it,
it is terrible also.

845
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,696
My daughter
has done well.

846
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:13,736
I am sure that a
misfortune will happen.

847
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:41,099
Why does he not
cry out, this man?

848
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:45,450
If any man sought to
kill me, I would cry out,

849
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:48,812
I would struggle,
I would not suffer.

850
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:58,257
Strike, Naaman,
strike, I tell you...

851
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:07,810
He has let his sword fall. He is
afraid, this slave! He did not kill him!

852
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,770
He is a coward this slave.
Let soldiers be sent.

853
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:15,490
Come hither, thou welt the friend
of him who is dead, is it not so?

854
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:19,210
Well, I tell thee, there are not dead
men enough. Get ye to the soldiers

855
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,810
and bid them go down and
bring me the thing that I ask,

856
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:27,250
the thing the Tetrarch has promised
me, the thing that is mine.

857
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:33,490
Hither, ye soldiers. Get ye into this
cistern and bring me the head of this man.

858
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:36,090
Tetrarch,
Tetrarch!

859
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:41,758
Command your soldiers that they
bring me the head of Jokanaan.

860
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:38,050
Thou wouldst not suffer me
to kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.

861
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,218
Well, I will
kiss it now.

862
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:45,530
I will bite it with my teeth
as one bites a ripe fruit.

863
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:50,330
Yes, I will kiss
thy mouth, Jokanaan.

864
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:57,530
I said it. Did I not
say it? I said it.

865
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:00,732
I will kiss
it now.

866
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:09,370
But wherefore dost thou
not look at me, Jokanaan?

867
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:14,370
Thine eyes that were so terrible, so
full of rage and scorn, are shut now.

868
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,010
Wherefore are
they shut?

869
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:23,530
Open thine eyelids! Lift
up thine eyes, Jokanaan.

870
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:30,770
Art thou afraid of me, that
thou wilt not look at me?

871
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:35,010
And thy tongue, that was like a red
snake darting poison, it moves no more,

872
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:36,890
it says nothing
now, Jokanaan,

873
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:40,530
that scarlet viper that
spat its venom against me.

874
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:47,570
It is strange, is it not? How is it
that the red viper stirs no longer?

875
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,810
Thou wouldst have none of me,
Jokanaan. Thou didst reject me.

876
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:53,250
Thou didst speak evil
words against me.

877
01:11:53,350 --> 01:12:03,071
Thou didst treat me as
a harlot, as a wanton.

878
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:05,935
Me,...

879
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:09,410
...Salomé

880
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:14,217
daughter of Herodias,
Princess of Judaea!

881
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:21,953
Well, Jokanaan, I still live,
but thou, thou art dead...

882
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:25,810
...and thy head belongs to me.
I can do with it what I will.

883
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:28,850
I can throw it to the dogs
and to the birds of the air.

884
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:34,836
That which the dogs leave behind,
the birds of the air shall devour.

885
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:39,499
Oh, Jokanaan!

886
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:44,641
Jokanaan, thou welt the
only man that I have loved.

887
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:52,720
All other men were hateful to me.
But thou, thou wert beautiful!

888
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:58,330
Thy body was a column of
ivory set on a silver socket.

889
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:04,330
It was a garden filled with
doves and silver lilies.

890
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:10,330
It was a tower of silver
decked with shields of ivory.

891
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:15,490
There was nothing in the
world so white as thy body.

892
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:18,730
There was nothing in the
world so black as thy hair.

893
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:24,318
In the whole world, there was
nothing so red as thy mouth.

894
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:28,810
Thy voice was a censer that
scattered strange perfumes,

895
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:37,277
and when I looked on thee,
I heard a strange music.

896
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:45,197
Wherefore didst thou not
look at me, Jokanaan?

897
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:51,930
Behind thine hands and thy
curses thou didst hide thy face.

898
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:55,450
Thou didst put upon thine eyes the
coverings of him who would see his God.

899
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:59,450
Well, thou hast seen
thy God, Jokanaan,

900
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:05,258
but me... me, thou
didst never see.

901
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:13,570
If thou hadst seen me thou
wouldst have loved me.

902
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:21,380
I saw thee, Jokanaan,
and I loved thee.

903
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:24,814
Oh, how I
loved thee!

904
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,570
I love thee
yet, Jokanaan.

905
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:34,740
I love
thee only.

906
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:42,770
I am athirst for thy beauty,
I am hungry for thy body,

907
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:48,410
neither wine nor fruits
can appease my desire.

908
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:52,330
What shall I do
now, Jokanaan?

909
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:58,090
Neither the great waters nor the
floods can quench my passion.

910
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:01,570
I was a princess,
thou didst scorn me.

911
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:06,450
I was a virgin, thou didst
take my virginity from me.

912
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:14,330
I was chaste, and thou didst
fill my veins with fire.

913
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:19,930
Wherefore didst thou not
look at me, Jokanaan?

914
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:26,410
If thou hadst looked at
me thou hadst loved me.

915
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:29,130
Well I know that thou
wouldst have loved me,

916
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:34,450
and the mystery of love is
greater than the mystery of death.

917
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:39,575
Love only should
one consider.

918
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:03,050
She is monstrous,
thy daughter,

919
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:07,936
she is altogether
monstrous.

920
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:14,890
In truth, what she has
done was a great crime.

921
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:20,410
I am sure that
it was a crime

922
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,130
against an
unknown God.

923
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:29,570
I approve of what my daughter has
done. And I will stay here now.

924
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:36,413
Ah! There speaks
the incestuous wife!

925
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,050
Come.

926
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:42,412
I will not
stay here.

927
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:47,257
Come, I tell thee.

928
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:51,330
Surely some evil
will befall.

929
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:58,290
Manasseh, lssachar, Ozias,
put out the torches.

930
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:01,610
I will not
look at things,

931
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:05,130
I will not suffer
things to look at me.

932
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:08,617
Put out the
torches!

933
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:14,255
Hide the moon.
Hide the stars.

934
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,530
Come, Herodias,

935
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:23,370
let us hide ourselves
in our palace.

936
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:26,379
I begin to
be afraid.

937
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:35,141
I have kissed thy
mouth, Jokanaan.

938
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:38,656
I have kissed
thy mouth.

939
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:44,970
There was a bitter
taste on thy lips.

940
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:49,610
Was it the
taste of blood?

941
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:53,654
But perchance it is
the taste of love.

942
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:59,579
For they say that love
hath a bitter taste.

943
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:03,541
But what of that?

944
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:07,695
What of that?

945
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:17,810
I have kissed thy
mouth, Jokanaan.

946
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,690
Kill that woman!
