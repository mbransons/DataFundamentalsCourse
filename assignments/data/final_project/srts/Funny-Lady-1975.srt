1
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,399
<i>I got a blind date</i>
<i>Waiting to call on me</i>

2
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,043
<i>Any minute now</i>

3
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:45,679
<i>I got a blind date</i>
<i>What am I gonna see?</i>

4
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,083
<i>Any minute now</i>

5
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,845
<i>Right over there's the doorway</i>
<i>He will be walking through</i>

6
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:55,968
<i>Will he be 6 foot 8</i>
<i>Or only 4 foot 2?</i>

7
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,238
It could happen!

8
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:00,845
<i>I got a blind date</i>
<i>Waiting to come around</i>

9
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,164
<i>Any minute now</i>

10
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:06,243
<i>Oy, but I'm nervous</i>
<i>Listen to my heart pound</i>

11
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:12,319
<i>What do I need this headache?</i>
<i>Single is not a crime</i>

12
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,481
<i>I got a blind date</i>
<i>And with my luck</i>

13
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,645
<i>He'll come on time</i>

14
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:26,278
<i>I got a girlfriend, Shirley</i>
<i>Who says, "Why not?"</i>

15
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,604
<i>She's an idiot</i>

16
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,364
<i>This guy's a friend from a friend</i>
<i>Of a friend she got</i>

17
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,718
<i>What an idiot</i>

18
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:37,525
<i>What do I need from Shirley?</i>
<i>Her and her 50 cup</i>

19
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,442
<i>I got a blind date</i>
<i>And I'm praying</i>

20
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,719
<i>He stands me up</i>

21
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:46,882
What am I praying he stands me up?
I<i>'</i>ll stand him up.

22
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:50,246
I<i>'</i>m gonna hide under the bed.
He<i>'</i>ll never see me.

23
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,084
He<i>'</i>ll go away, and that<i>'</i>s
the end of that. Perfect!

24
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,639
You keep quiet, not a word.
You didn<i>'</i>t see a thing.

25
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:02,840
Oh, there he is.
Okay, quiet everybody, quiet!

26
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,641
Rosalie? She doesn<i>'</i>t seem to be here.

27
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,722
That<i>'</i>s never happened to me before.

28
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,846
It worked! He never saw me.

29
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:17,727
Boy, am I lucky.
I didn<i>'</i>t see him neither.

30
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:21,120
But I can imagine
what a lox that one was.

31
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,877
- Wait, that not right?
- He looks like Rudolph!

32
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,847
- Who?
- Rudolph Valentino.

33
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,683
- Get away!
- That<i>'</i>s right.

34
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:34,639
- Is this person kidding me around?
- No!

35
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,520
Get away.

36
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,321
Well, that<i>'</i>s what happened.
I let him get away.

37
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,961
<i>What'll I do now?</i>
<i>Maybe become a nun</i>

38
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:51,007
That<i>'</i>s impossible.

39
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:55,367
<i>I'm calling Shirley</i>
<i>Maybe she'll bring a gun</i>

40
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,520
<i>Please, Shirley</i>

41
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,564
<i>Even if he's Lon Chaney</i>
<i>Fat, bald or short or tall</i>

42
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,842
<i>Having a blind date's better than</i>
<i>Having no date at no time</i>

43
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:12,525
<i>With no one at all</i>

44
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,684
He<i>'</i>s cute. Hello there!

45
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:20,763
Oh, my God! Oh, Shirley!

46
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,885
Thank you. I can<i>'</i>t find him.

47
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:34,643
He said he<i>'</i>d be here
before the finale.

48
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,088
He said if he could make it tonight,
he<i>'</i>d get here before the finale.

49
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:43,605
- He<i>'</i>ll be here. He<i>'</i>ll be here.
- Don<i>'</i>t get your hopes up too high.

50
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:47,205
- I really hate to see this show close.
- We<i>'</i>ll do another one soon.

51
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,246
See you on the breadline.

52
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,647
I told you, I told you, Adele!

53
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,005
<i>"</i> I<i>'</i>ll always love you.<i>"</i>
He<i>'</i>ll always love me.

54
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,841
Fanny...

55
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,841
...Nick didn<i>'</i>t come with the flowers.

56
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:19,442
This did.

57
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,649
I<i>'</i>m afraid it<i>'</i>s pumpkin time,
princess.

58
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,040
Why don<i>'</i>t you go pass out...

59
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,247
...the presents to the kids.

60
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:46,242
Before the booze eats its
way out of the bottles.

61
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,604
Easy come, easy go.

62
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,642
Out, out! If you<i>'</i>re gonna sob,
do a single.

63
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:49,406
Anything coming up?
Anything at all?

64
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,641
Oh, yeah. I<i>'</i>ve auditioned
for a few things.

65
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,804
I<i>'</i>m scared, Fanny.

66
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,200
I think I<i>'</i>m going to be
a little too...

67
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,044
...distinguished to go on shaking
it around, you know?

68
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,923
How many shows have we
been in, Bobby?

69
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,239
- Six?
- Oh, easy.

70
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,843
You knew me before Nick...

71
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,647
...during Nick...

72
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:19,683
...after Nick.

73
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:24,480
You always do things for me.
It<i>'</i>s time I started paying you.

74
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:30,326
- Hey, Fanny. I<i>'</i>m not really...
- Maybe you<i>'</i>re not, but I am, really.

75
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,278
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I got the willies too.

76
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:38,238
The show closing...
Can you balance a checkbook?

77
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:42,443
Now, you know, I bet I could.
If somebody showed me how.

78
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:45,681
You don<i>'</i>t have to offer me a job.
I can<i>'</i>t take your money.

79
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,682
Who<i>'</i>s offering you money?
You think I got any money?

80
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,807
- We<i>'</i>ll all be back soon, Miss Brice.
- You bet.

81
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:54,722
You better start getting
the gum off the seats.

82
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:56,880
- Hey, I got a terrific idea.
- What?

83
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:01,088
Move into my place, Bobby.
No pay, but room and board.

84
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:03,968
I think we can help each other.
I mean it.

85
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:06,643
I<i>'</i>m gonna say something stupid.

86
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:13,199
I know a little of what you<i>'</i>re going
through. You see, I miss Nick too.

87
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,441
So I do know a little bit
of what it<i>'</i>s like.

88
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,883
It<i>'</i>s just a matter of time, Fanny.

89
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:25,283
And Nick<i>'</i>s pride. He will make
a comeback, and when he does...

90
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,360
...you<i>'</i>ll be there.
- Yeah.

91
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:31,602
I ain<i>'</i>t going nowhere, kid.
Except home. Come on.

92
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,441
I<i>'</i>ll race you.

93
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:38,037
When do you start the new Follies?

94
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:41,206
He can<i>'</i>t raise the money, Barney.

95
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:46,204
Ziegfeld can<i>'</i>t raise the money?
Not even from Buck?

96
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,725
- Things are tough.
- Even the grocer is suing us.

97
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:53,484
It<i>'</i>ll look lousy going
to court over corn flakes.

98
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:57,881
Fanny, darling, I think
I<i>'</i>d better make you a loan.

99
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,485
<i>"</i> Dollink,<i>"</i> I better sell my house.
What can I get?

100
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:06,644
Not anywhere near what it<i>'</i>s worth,
with the mortgage it carries.

101
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:09,722
- What about a second mortgage?
- What about a loan?

102
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:12,164
What<i>'</i>s the use of borrowing?

103
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:15,845
- There are Fran<i>'</i>s holdings.
- I didn<i>'</i>t hear it.

104
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,727
It<i>'</i>s all right, please.

105
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,527
He<i>'</i>ll understand.

106
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,163
There<i>'</i>s an important meeting.
I do apologize, Mr. Baruch.

107
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:29,846
Excuse me, Mr. Baruch,
but I bought you this milkshake.

108
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:33,081
Sorry to bust in on you
like this, Miss Brice.

109
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:36,241
I hope the milkshake<i>'</i>s
not C.O.D., kid.

110
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:40,964
Now that we<i>'</i>re all here,
is there anything I can do?

111
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,564
Fanny, Mr. Rose is
a man of many parts.

112
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:47,085
He<i>'</i>s a champion speed-writer,
200 words a minute.

113
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,479
We<i>'</i>re going over holdings.

114
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,799
Maybe I can be of some help.

115
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,517
- Do you mind?
- Why should I mind?

116
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,043
So, l...

117
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,681
I<i>'</i>d like to make a few suggestions.

118
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,360
You should take a few more losses.
These will only go lower.

119
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:07,122
So, I<i>'</i>d sell.

120
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:11,840
American Hide at 34, now 81 <i>l</i>2.
AT&T bought at 150, now 111.

121
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,681
Cellutex at 60, now 3.

122
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,887
Keep it. We shouldn<i>'</i>t cause
them more aggravation.

123
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,884
Cuban Sugar, from 21 to 3,
Elkhorn Coal bought at 51 <i>l</i>2, now 1 <i>l</i>8.

124
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:26,281
- Elkhorn Coal? Figures.
- Noranda Mines bought at 17, now 17.

125
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,645
Bought at 17, still at 17?
That<i>'</i>s a winner.

126
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:32,245
Maracaibo Oil bought at 103,
now 13<i>l</i>4.

127
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:35,049
Pennsylvania Coal
bought at 121 <i>l</i>2, now 4.

128
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,598
Sell! Before they wipe my kid out!

129
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,646
Billy, did you get it?

130
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,048
- That sums it up.
- There<i>'</i>s an act in there.

131
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:09,883
Now if you<i>'</i>d allow me
to make you a loan...

132
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,884
- Thank you for seeing me, Barney.
- Anytime, my dear. Anytime.

133
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,563
Come on, Bobby.

134
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,004
- Nice seeing you again.
- Same here.

135
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,442
Listen...

136
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,444
...Miss Brice, hang onto that AT&T.
Believe me.

137
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,442
Who<i>'</i>s the pansy?

138
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:39,638
Mr. Moore is her secretary,
an old friend from the days with Nick.

139
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,802
She should<i>'</i>ve taken a loss.

140
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:45,489
Look at this child.
That was gorgeous!

141
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:49,881
You better get out there.
Why don<i>'</i>t you cut a record?

142
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:53,804
Who can afford?
Where am I gonna get new material?

143
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:57,439
We should get all duded up,
go around to all the spots.

144
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:09,245
Right, right. Wonderful, wonderful.

145
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:11,924
What<i>'</i>d she say?

146
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,637
It makes her mad
when I let my nose drip.

147
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,768
So you mean anytime my nose drips...

148
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,477
...I have to say <i>"</i> Mouche mon nez<i>"</i>?

149
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:25,439
Fanny, really. Let<i>'</i>s do like I said.
Go out and tour the clubs.

150
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:28,157
See if there<i>'</i>s anything
we can borrow.

151
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:59,647
This way, please.

152
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,043
Oh, there<i>'</i>s Fanny Brice!

153
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,802
- Find out who wrote that song.
- Sure. Order me a stinger.

154
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:16,680
- Hey, Buck.
- Bobby. Fanny!

155
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,842
- Buck! How are they running?
- Dandy. Good to see you.

156
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,239
Meet Miss Norma Butler.

157
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:27,641
- Glad to meet you, Norma.
- It<i>'</i>s a thrill to meet you.

158
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,847
- Nice set of beads.
- Thank you.

159
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:32,968
Fanny, I<i>'</i>ll call you.

160
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:34,642
- Let<i>'</i>s go, baby.
- Bye.

161
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,846
Hey there, Miss Brice.
How are you?

162
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:45,004
Quite an entrance.
You know how to part the waters.

163
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,245
Ain<i>'</i>t difficult in a bathtub.

164
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:50,959
- Well, a small thing, but my own.
- Oh, yeah?

165
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,448
- Good for you.
- Hello there, Joe.

166
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:00,127
You don<i>'</i>t remember me?
From Mr. Baruch<i>'</i>s office. <i>"</i>Sell!<i>"</i>

167
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,639
Did you hang onto that AT&T?

168
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:09,044
- Oh, yeah. I did. You better be right.
- Well, I<i>'</i>m always right.

169
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,962
You got some ashes on your jacket.

170
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,882
When I saw you, you were
working for Barney.

171
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,485
Respectable.
Suddenly you<i>'</i>re in the clip business?

172
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,289
Not so suddenly.

173
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,966
I haven<i>'</i>t worked for Mr. Baruch
in years. We<i>'</i>re just friends.

174
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,845
- You mind?
- No, go right ahead.

175
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:35,443
- How do you...?
- Oh, excuse me.

176
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:40,009
Oh, thank you. That<i>'</i>s cute.

177
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:42,046
To tell you the truth...

178
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:48,448
...I knew you were in that office
that day. I just wanted to meet you.

179
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:57,685
Waiter, one Scotch and water,
and one stinger. What<i>'</i>ll you have?

180
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:01,285
The drinks are on the house.
Bring me the usual.

181
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,958
Something you stir up in back?

182
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:07,485
- I drink celery tonic.
- Celery tonic?

183
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:11,642
- Mother said, <i>"</i>A boozer is a loser.<i>"</i>
- You had a mother?

184
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:17,046
So, how<i>'</i>d you get from Baruch
to here? And why?

185
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,924
- Maybe I wanted to meet girls.
- You like the girls.

186
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:24,718
Sorry I took long. The guy
who wrote it runs this club.

187
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:26,448
His name<i>'</i>s Rose.

188
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,237
That a fact?

189
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,279
Bobby, I<i>'</i>m sorry. You remember
Mr. Rose from Baruch<i>'</i>s office?

190
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:41,646
Oh! Oh, yeah, sure.

191
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,807
I didn<i>'</i>t recognize you
without your shake.

192
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,843
You really write
<i>"</i> More Than You Know<i>"</i>?

193
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:51,559
I wrote it before breakfast.

194
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,687
<i>"</i>When A Woman Loves A Man<i>"</i>
before my coffee.

195
00:15:54,929 --> 00:16:00,083
I might like to record it, maybe we
can get together on a second number.

196
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:01,808
I<i>'</i>m sure we can.

197
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:06,440
I have three numbers I think
would be terrific for you.

198
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:10,602
But I promised them to Ruth Etting.

199
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:12,999
Maybe I can get one of them back.

200
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:17,208
But if I do, I<i>'</i>ll let you have
it for what Etting pays...

201
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:22,318
...which is one-third off of my price,
because I like the broad.

202
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:26,687
- I feel a little sorry for her.
- Do you believe your ears?

203
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,848
Kid...

204
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:34,038
...new song writers
pay me to record their stuff.

205
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,041
I ain<i>'</i>t that new.

206
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:43,039
<i>"</i> More Than You Know,<i>"</i> I don<i>'</i>t like
enough to buy, only enough to steal.

207
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:48,437
That<i>'</i>s what I said in the first place.
<i>"</i> More Than You Know<i>"</i> is a steal.

208
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:51,886
But take it.
I wanna talk about the other number.

209
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:53,687
The one you<i>'</i>re gonna love.

210
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,558
You<i>'</i>ll love what I do for you.
When I record, it sells.

211
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:02,440
I know that. You<i>'</i>re the greatest.
I<i>'</i>m lucky you know I<i>'</i>m alive.

212
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,841
But let me talk about something else.
This other number...

213
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,968
I believe in it so much,
I<i>'</i>m willing to gamble.

214
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:16,363
Record this, I<i>'</i>ll make you full
partner. I<i>'</i>ll give you the rights.

215
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:19,197
If it sells under 100,000,
we split the royalties.

216
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,680
It goes over,
give me my full percentage.

217
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,083
That<i>'</i>s before we even start talking
about the really big numbers...

218
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,083
...which is sheet music.
So you see, it<i>'</i>s all a steal.

219
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:35,241
- Metaphorically.
- Metaphorically?

220
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:42,045
This is a shrewd kid, Bobby.

221
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,645
I<i>'</i>ll marry him.
I hate paying for material.

222
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,839
Even laughs in the right places.

223
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,048
If you get your suit cleaned,
it<i>'</i>s a match.

224
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:59,160
Ruth Etting, my ass.

225
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:02,287
Anytime I want your ass,
I<i>'</i>ll know what to call it.

226
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:03,598
Come on, Bobby.

227
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,238
- I expect a lead sheet.
- Thursday.

228
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:09,879
- Can I have my cigarettes, please?
- Oh, yeah, I<i>'</i>m...

229
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:11,687
Ganef, huh?

230
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,438
Take care of yourself, will you?

231
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,645
That<i>'</i>s a wonderful girl there.

232
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,240
Three, four...

233
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:45,646
What<i>'</i>s with the clarinets?
It<i>'</i>s killing the melody.

234
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:53,839
Why don<i>'</i>t you sit over there, kid?

235
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:58,560
Everything<i>'</i>ll be all right, you know.
Just relax, okay?

236
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,845
Where<i>'</i>re we up to?

237
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,647
Bar what? Okay, 15.

238
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:07,843
The drums, too heavy. I don<i>'</i>t like it.

239
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:10,842
Skinny, smoother on the drums.

240
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,842
- You wanna try one?
- Yeah, sure.

241
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,565
Why don<i>'</i>t you see how it sounds.

242
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:20,688
I know how it sounds. Lousy.
The strings are too hot.

243
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,602
- What?
- The strings are too hot.

244
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:28,688
- Let me hear four bars from the top.
- Four bars from the top.

245
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:39,604
He<i>'</i>s right, Fritz.
Bring down the strings.

246
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,441
Bring up the horns.

247
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:49,885
- Bring up the horns.
- Bring up the horns, boys.

248
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,924
Let<i>'</i>s go for a take. Top?

249
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:04,887
Could we take that a little slower?

250
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:07,444
Ready?

251
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:10,726
Fanny Brice. <i>"</i> More Than You Know.<i>"</i>
Take One.

252
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:57,648
Come in.

253
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,479
When did you see Billy Rose last?

254
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:05,121
Three days ago.

255
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:08,600
I don<i>'</i>t believe it! Nobody can!

256
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:12,319
He has just announced a show
starring W.C. Fields...

257
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:16,926
...Marilyn Miller, Eddie Cantor,
Bert Robbins and you.

258
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,363
In that order?

259
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:23,524
Well, no, actually you
do get first billing.

260
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:31,129
Well, I guess I better go have
a little talk with the little man.

261
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:54,408
Are you a decorator
or are you a painter?

262
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:57,687
Paint the chair,
I<i>'</i>ll hold this watch on you.

263
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:00,887
However long it takes,
we<i>'</i>ll multiply it by 200.

264
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,848
So we<i>'</i>ll know how long it takes.

265
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:06,239
That<i>'</i>s the time I pay you for.

266
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:10,164
Sure, Mr. Rose. Where do you
want me to do the painting?

267
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:14,880
Right here, you thief, where
I can watch you. Got a cigarette?

268
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,438
- Just one second.
- Yeah, come in.

269
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:25,248
- It<i>'</i>s a wonderful surprise.
- I<i>'</i>ll bet.

270
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:29,843
What are you stand...?
Do it in the hall.

271
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:31,647
Do it where I can see you.

272
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:34,687
- Miss Brice.
- Painting contractor.

273
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:36,248
The chairs.

274
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:43,007
- All right, you ready?
- One second, one second.

275
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,841
All right, go, go.

276
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:50,406
Thieving bastards.
Gotta watch them every minute.

277
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:59,039
Well, I<i>'</i>m very glad
that you came up here.

278
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:04,798
I<i>'</i>m sorry you found me like this.
I worked very late at the club.

279
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:06,488
I appreciate you<i>'</i>re a hard worker.

280
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:10,404
What I don<i>'</i>t appreciate
is that you<i>'</i>re a fast worker.

281
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,164
Where do you get the nerve,
using my name in your release?

282
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:16,969
- Interested in explanations?
- In retractions.

283
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:19,882
- Maybe you<i>'</i>ll agree to...

284
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:23,519
To be in some half-assed
sandlot production...

285
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,125
...by a tasteless
Johnny-come-lately hustler like you?

286
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:29,360
I was a Ziegfeld star when you...

287
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:33,079
...were sweating through
shorthand class!

288
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:36,048
I know where I can get $50,000
right now.

289
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:37,563
- Really?
- Yes.

290
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,198
If I get you, I can pull in...

291
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:43,680
...another star.
But it<i>'</i>s you I really want.

292
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,966
And you can get 50,000
when Ziegfeld can<i>'</i>t?

293
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:49,279
Hey, that ain<i>'</i>t good enough.

294
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,238
- I know you can do better than that.
- Sure.

295
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,407
Where?

296
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,688
- Where?
- Where can you get the 50,000?

297
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,808
- Bolton.
- Buck is Ziggy<i>'</i>s bank.

298
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:06,687
- He<i>'</i>s mine now.
- How?

299
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,442
Believes in me.

300
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:17,248
Maybe I<i>'</i>m wrong. Maybe you<i>'</i>re not
just a nickel-and-dime hustler.

301
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:21,761
Maybe what you are is a bigtime pimp.

302
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:25,604
Buck<i>'</i>s got a new girl.
Does she get billing?

303
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,522
- She works sketches? Don<i>'</i>t lie.
- Not yours.

304
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:34,682
- Look, Fanny, you need a show.
- Really?

305
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:39,201
Why try to scrape up an act
when you can do a show?

306
00:25:39,449 --> 00:25:40,518
You need me.

307
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:44,000
- Kid, you need me.
- Let me rephrase it.

308
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:48,561
- Please. Use me.
- Let me rephrase it. Don<i>'</i>t use me.

309
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:52,802
You want me to be in your
cockamamie show, you ask me nice.

310
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:00,644
Fanny, do my show.

311
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,161
Please.

312
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,726
Yeah. Please.

313
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:07,958
Because...

314
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:13,442
I need you.

315
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:24,319
- Just don<i>'</i>t aggravate me.
- You<i>'</i>ll do it?

316
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:29,040
- What a crummy world.
- Thattagirl. Come on.

317
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:32,607
Why don<i>'</i>t you get a manicure?
Cost a buck.

318
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:35,889
It<i>'</i>s not the buck.
It takes 20 minutes.

319
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:39,963
- I<i>'</i>m done, Mr. Rose.
- I gotta use your john.

320
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:44,680
- Yeah, well, listen...
- Hello. Is that the door to the john?

321
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,525
- You<i>'</i>re Fanny! I don<i>'</i>t believe it!
- That Fanny Brice goes to the can?

322
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:55,685
Oh, my God! I see all your shows
every chance I get. I die laughing.

323
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,842
- Sometimes I laugh so hard that l...
- Fall right out of bed?

324
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:11,445
- Excuse me, Mr. Rose.
- Yeah, sorry.

325
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:14,044
- What have you got?
- Eight minutes.

326
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:17,042
Eight minutes per chair.
You want two coats?

327
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:20,281
That<i>'</i>s two coats, that<i>'</i>s 16 chairs.

328
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:24,886
Sixteen minutes times 200
is 3200 minutes.

329
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:28,804
53 hours. I<i>'</i>ll pay cash for 45 hours.
Take it or leave it.

330
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,688
Sure, Mr. Rose. It<i>'</i>s okay with me.
Glad to get the work.

331
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:34,921
And congratulations,
you got a show going.

332
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:39,642
Spray <i>'</i>em.

333
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:45,326
Four weeks of rehearsal,
this is what you come up with?

334
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:48,681
- What do you call that step?
- That<i>'</i>s a shim-sham.

335
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:54,128
Wonderful. I got such a headache.
What is this? Oh, that<i>'</i>s cute. Cute.

336
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:57,049
- Mr. Rose!
- What? They<i>'</i>re dancing.

337
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:01,082
You made 16 girls look like two.

338
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:05,601
Oy, you bring me roosters?
What are you smiling at? I hate it!

339
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:10,320
I pay this creep thousands.
To design shrouds? Put it on a horse!

340
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,524
- Who<i>'</i>s that?
- One of the showgirls.

341
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:15,680
- I know. Who hired her?
- You did.

342
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,885
Get rid of her. What?

343
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:23,840
- About Norma<i>'</i>s costumes...
- I<i>'</i>m sick about it. The director is.

344
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:26,649
- What would straighten them out?
- Money.

345
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:33,203
Can I hear the words this time?
I<i>'</i>d like to hear Billy Rose lyrics.

346
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:36,648
Paper, paper, paper.

347
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:42,645
There<i>'</i>s a <i>"</i> D<i>"</i> in cardboard.
A <i>"</i>car<i>"</i> board is on the end of a car!

348
00:28:46,969 --> 00:28:51,759
<i>I like him</i>
<i>I know he's phony</i>

349
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,888
<i>But when they package it nice</i>
<i>And market it right</i>

350
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:58,689
<i>I buy baloney</i>

351
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,686
<i>Yes, I like him</i>

352
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:08,367
<i>Though I can see he's the type</i>
<i>I better get busy and do unto first</i>

353
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:11,760
<i>Before I find he's done unto me</i>

354
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:15,081
<i>He's mostly made of chutzpah</i>

355
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:17,889
<i>A fake, a con, a lie</i>

356
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:24,840
<i>Could be I like him, maybe</i>
<i>'Cause so am I</i>

357
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:32,723
Hold it. Hold it! Hold it!

358
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:36,479
- Maybe I can help you out.
- I wish you would.

359
00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:40,278
I don<i>'</i>t think they understand
what you<i>'</i>re talking about.

360
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,999
Kids, Mr. Rose is a very fine
lyricist, an artist.

361
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,683
He has great respect
for the written word.

362
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:51,400
And I think he wants
you to articulate his artistry.

363
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:55,528
This girl didn<i>'</i>t get to where she got
from not understanding what I say.

364
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,202
You want me to show you?

365
00:29:57,449 --> 00:30:00,202
Hey, Freddie, one, two, three, four.

366
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:19,479
<i>I like her</i>
<i>I think she's funny</i>

367
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:24,041
<i>And we've a mutual interest</i>
<i>Deep down inside</i>

368
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,241
<i>Money</i>

369
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:32,925
<i>Yes, I like her</i>
<i>Although it's true she's the type</i>

370
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:36,201
<i>You'd better get busy</i>
<i>And do unto first</i>

371
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:39,486
<i>Before you find she's done unto you</i>

372
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:46,123
<i>I'm certain there's a Fanny</i>
<i>You seldom get to see</i>

373
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:53,846
<i>Whoever that is</i>
<i>Maybe she'll like me</i>

374
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,959
You know, you<i>'</i>d better learn
to be a little nicer.

375
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:08,480
Otherwise, those kids
are gonna walk out on you.

376
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,769
Where do you read that crap?
Take five.

377
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:22,765
Not now, Bobby. I know. Yeah.

378
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:41,318
- Have you seen Norma?
- Oh, no.

379
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:45,722
Bucky! Bucky. Oh, these costumes
are just beautiful.

380
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:51,123
Cliff, are you ready to start
the technical rehearsal yet? Cliff!

381
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:00,801
- You don<i>'</i>t think a moose gets a laugh?
- It<i>'</i>s a buffalo.

382
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:05,042
I can get a laugh without a moose
or whatever else.

383
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:10,807
Without tons of scenery. The thing
is over-produced. You<i>'</i>re dripping.

384
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:15,201
Screw it. The moose is funny
and he stays. I<i>'</i>m the producer.

385
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:17,758
You do your job, I<i>'</i>ll do mine.

386
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:27,485
I thought I hired a press agent.
Where have you been?

387
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:28,639
What<i>'</i>s the problem?

388
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:31,881
Have we got any press
coming from New York?

389
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:35,565
No, Billy. Just the locals,
and that<i>'</i>s bad enough.

390
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:38,198
That<i>'</i>s funny? Get out of here.

391
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:42,681
- He got a name?
- Charles. His name is Charles.

392
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:47,685
- This moose is gonna get a big laugh.
- Buffalo.

393
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:53,602
Watch your cues, Charles.
You step on a line, it<i>'</i>s open season.

394
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:41,925
- I<i>'</i>m so nervous!
- Break a leg.

395
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:29,847
Wait, I have an entrance.
My hat! Please, I have a cue.

396
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:58,088
Where<i>'</i>s Norma?

397
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,365
Tell that idiot to slow down!

398
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:46,520
What the hell is happening here?

399
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:51,244
What<i>'</i>s happening? What are you doing?

400
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:56,522
- Schmuck, what are you doing?
- I<i>'</i>m trying!

401
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:00,487
I<i>'</i>m doing my best, sweetheart.

402
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:22,529
Oh, God, wait<i>'</i>ll I get my hands
on that little putz!

403
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:27,078
<i>Fifty million Frenchmen</i>
<i>Can't be wrong</i>

404
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:31,528
<i>When they go</i>
<i>Ohh la la, la la la la</i>

405
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:35,199
<i>On the bully boulevard</i>

406
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:45,448
Let<i>'</i>s hope this one goes better.

407
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:48,763
You<i>'</i>re whistling
in the dressing room?

408
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:12,401
Keep it going. Keep going.

409
00:38:12,649 --> 00:38:16,164
Is this producer nuts?
We need an army to move this.

410
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:26,563
Keep going. Just keep going,
I don<i>'</i>t care how long.

411
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:30,927
<i>"</i>You do your job, I<i>'</i>ll do mine.<i>"</i>
What crap! Get out!

412
00:38:31,169 --> 00:38:33,808
If you<i>'</i>d sing like you yell,
we<i>'</i>d have a hit.

413
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:36,404
- I<i>'</i>ll give you a hit.
- Dress, Fanny.

414
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:40,801
Listen, we had a little technical
trouble in the first half.

415
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:44,564
The trouble is that we got
an amateur producer.

416
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:48,722
Get out of this room, you little bum.
Throw him out.

417
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:51,403
Get Bobby to throw this bum out.

418
00:38:51,649 --> 00:38:56,359
If you<i>'</i>re gonna have me thrown out,
it won<i>'</i>t be by your pet poodle.

419
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:59,885
Lovely, darling.
A trifle slow in the beginning.

420
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,883
The buses stopped running
and we got an act to go.

421
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:06,597
- They adore it.
- They love it.

422
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:09,682
Five minutes.
Second act in five minutes.

423
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:10,884
Get out!

424
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:14,804
Billy, I<i>'</i>d like to talk to you
about a tiny cut.

425
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:20,524
Would you look at this place?
Drops the shells all over the floor.

426
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:57,645
Keep singing, keep singing.

427
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:27,248
Hit the rain.

428
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:37,202
Boys, come back. It<i>'</i>s only water!
Just keep playing.

429
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:49,928
Thank you, mister.

430
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:57,403
- What<i>'</i>s that?
- The reviews.

431
00:40:57,649 --> 00:40:59,446
- Of what?
- The first act.

432
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:01,998
Thank God they didn<i>'</i>t stick around.

433
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:06,720
There are 10 people out there.
I<i>'</i>m going to lay them in the aisles.

434
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:42,562
Fanny?

435
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:46,399
- Get me the house detective!
- It<i>'</i>s me!

436
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:50,608
- Are you crazy?
- It<i>'</i>s only a joke. It<i>'</i>s only a joke.

437
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,398
It<i>'</i>s me. I got those tickets.
We<i>'</i>re rehearsing.

438
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,367
- You idiot!
- Charades.

439
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:59,123
I<i>'</i>ll call you later. Right, goodbye.

440
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:02,884
Are you some kind of
break-and-enter artist?

441
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:05,927
You wouldn<i>'</i>t let me in.
I borrowed a key.

442
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:08,046
You gave me a heart attack!

443
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:11,087
- I<i>'</i>ll tell you how we fix the show.
- We?!

444
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:15,563
Mr. Rose, I have been
through burlesque, Ziegfeld...

445
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:18,448
...childbirth, divorce, the Crash.

446
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:22,159
Last year I saw my daughter
ride in a pony show.

447
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:25,128
I<i>'</i>ve also been
kicked in the ass by a horse.

448
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:30,163
But I<i>'</i>ve never been through
anything like last night.

449
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,525
- I know. I know.
- What?

450
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:37,160
- Look, we got a few weak spots.
- Buffalo shit!

451
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:38,968
- Look...
- Get out!

452
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:41,359
Childbirth, was that easy?

453
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:43,679
Like pushing a piano
through a transom.

454
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:47,319
- We gotta push this one through.
- You push this one.

455
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:49,639
8 a.m., I call my lawyers. Out!

456
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:52,487
All right.

457
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:55,923
All right, all right, all right.

458
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:02,600
Goddamn it.

459
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:05,124
What is the matter with you?

460
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:08,961
I might as well tell you
the whole mess, Fanny.

461
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:10,198
What?

462
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:15,605
Wasn<i>'</i>t just Bucky<i>'</i>s money.
I spent that weeks ago.

463
00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:18,523
I needed some more so I...

464
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:25,602
...I had to borrow from the boys,
and it<i>'</i>s gone too.

465
00:43:29,529 --> 00:43:33,681
- They<i>'</i>ll build me into the highway.
- That<i>'</i>s good news.

466
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:35,601
- I<i>'</i>m not kidding.
- I<i>'</i>m not either.

467
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:39,967
I<i>'</i>m into them bad.
They<i>'</i>re gonna come for me.

468
00:43:40,209 --> 00:43:44,760
Oh, God, they<i>'</i>re gonna come for me.
They<i>'</i>ll come for me.

469
00:43:45,009 --> 00:43:47,079
You borrowed money with no backup?

470
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:51,607
- Yep.
- You must be smoky in the head.

471
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:58,242
Look, you gotta help me, please.
I know I can fix the show.

472
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:01,003
Please, I can fix it. Give it to me.

473
00:44:01,249 --> 00:44:05,037
Bucky<i>'</i>ll stay in.
If you stay, I know I can fix it.

474
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:10,283
What happened was mostly my fault.
You were right about everything.

475
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:13,566
The sets, the costumes.
Charles? Everything.

476
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:15,322
But the songs are good.

477
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:20,484
I<i>'</i>ll get some dancers to back up Bert.
And the sketches, they<i>'</i>re good.

478
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:22,959
They<i>'</i>re swamped by
your damn production.

479
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:28,329
Teach me. I can learn.
I learn it faster than anybody.

480
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:31,641
- You need a show.
- You gonna start that again?

481
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:34,397
I don<i>'</i>t need you. I<i>'</i>m a star.

482
00:44:34,649 --> 00:44:37,402
Listen. Come on, Fanny.

483
00:44:37,649 --> 00:44:42,848
- Where you gonna get some more dough?
- Same place I got it before.

484
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:47,127
Why not?

485
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:51,362
You get knocked off, you might
as well do it for a good sum.

486
00:44:52,129 --> 00:44:55,724
- Let me take a look at this.
- Ow! What are you, nuts?

487
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:59,968
Why don<i>'</i>t you get some sleep.
Why are you up? It<i>'</i>s 4 a.m.

488
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:05,240
You must be crazy, I<i>'</i>ll tell you.
- Go to sleep.

489
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:07,525
Give me the key. The key.

490
00:45:07,769 --> 00:45:10,522
- I<i>'</i>ll return it.
- Give me the key.

491
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:15,000
Thanks.

492
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:19,565
Go to sleep. It<i>'</i>s 4:00.

493
00:45:21,729 --> 00:45:23,162
Billy...

494
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:28,605
...you think you can get your friends
to take Charles for a ride?

495
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:43,880
<i>You gotta dump two-thirds of the set.</i>
<i>Simplify the orchestrations.</i>

496
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:47,838
<i>The Spanish number.</i>
<i>Cut the gypsies and the campfire.</i>

497
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:04,607
<i>Did you ever hear of "in one"?</i>
<i>A curtain and me.</i>

498
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,727
<i>See, I come out,</i>
<i>and I'm Martha Graham.</i>

499
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:21,759
<i>You see, Billy, in a tutu,</i>
<i>I can be funny.</i>

500
00:46:24,169 --> 00:46:26,888
<i>If Little Eva was Jewish,</i>
<i>maybe funny.</i>

501
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:31,000
<i>- Time for us to part</i>
<i>- I'll be twinkling</i>

502
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:34,639
<i>So long, honey lamb</i>
<i>I'll be keeping you</i>

503
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:36,840
<i>Right here in my heart</i>

504
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,841
<i>Watch me winkling</i>

505
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:44,004
<i>Think of this as temporary</i>
<i>Just a toodle-loo</i>

506
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:45,688
Toodle-Ioo to you too!

507
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:05,569
Oh, God, was that a note!

508
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,798
It was given to me by my friend
Grace Moore on my birthday.

509
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:13,968
Oy, was she glad to get rid of it.

510
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:19,878
<i>I gotta have more in the second act,</i>
<i>a new number.</i>

511
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:05,003
<i>What about Bert's number</i>
<i>"Clap Hands"? Where are the hands?</i>

512
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:18,998
- Another number that<i>'</i>s gonna work.
- It<i>'</i>s working now.

513
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:23,003
It<i>'</i>s almost working.
Get the sequins off the gloves.

514
00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:26,689
Hey, Clark, get the
goddamn sequins off the gloves!

515
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:27,360
Hey, Clark, get the
goddamn sequins off the gloves!

516
00:50:28,649 --> 00:50:31,846
Yeah, listen, what can I tell you?
He<i>'</i>s a maniac.

517
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:35,718
Listen, I didn<i>'</i>t invent them.
I<i>'</i>m just his press agent.

518
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:38,964
- Did you call Buffalo?
- I<i>'</i>m on it.

519
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:42,087
Sorry, this evening<i>'</i>s
performance is sold out.

520
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:47,039
Hey, we<i>'</i>re sold out tonight?
Hey, you hear? We<i>'</i>re sold out.

521
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:52,924
We<i>'</i>re sold out. We<i>'</i>re sold out.
We<i>'</i>re sold out. Hey!

522
00:50:54,209 --> 00:50:57,758
- Let<i>'</i>s make this the last one.
- Watch the silk.

523
00:50:58,009 --> 00:51:03,208
We<i>'</i>re SRO tonight.
We<i>'</i>re SRO tomorrow night.

524
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:05,727
Here<i>'</i>s the picture.

525
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:11,881
I<i>'</i>ll take a celery tonic
out of your shoe.

526
00:51:12,129 --> 00:51:16,486
Not from this shoe. This is a
custom-made shoe. Give me my shoe.

527
00:51:16,729 --> 00:51:19,846
Give me something.
Give me a nice tooth.

528
00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:23,479
You got a nice tooth.
Give me an earring.

529
00:51:23,729 --> 00:51:25,003
Give me your hand.

530
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:28,963
Get up off the floor.
You<i>'</i>ll ruin your pants.

531
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:33,202
It<i>'</i>s a new act. Brice and Rose.
We go through life together.

532
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:35,804
You better do a job
on the four-sheets.

533
00:51:36,169 --> 00:51:40,321
You have to see it on an
outhouse wall 200 yards away...

534
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:42,764
...going 60 miles an hour.

535
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:47,480
No fine print.
All that matters is, can they see it?

536
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,846
Yellow and black.
You got it? Good.

537
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:54,081
You<i>'</i>re such a slob.
Why do you drop your shells?

538
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:57,605
I gave you good advice.
I hope you got it.

539
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:00,886
- When I got you, I got it all.
- Are you crazy?

540
00:52:01,169 --> 00:52:03,399
What? Nobody can touch a star?

541
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:07,279
Stop that! I don<i>'</i>t like being handled.

542
00:52:07,529 --> 00:52:08,928
Is that right?

543
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:11,205
- Is that right?
- Stop that!

544
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:29,365
I am sorry, I really am.
I<i>'</i>m so sorry. Billy, please.

545
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:33,522
Can I help you brush your coat off?

546
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:38,923
Billy, I just grabbed the first thing.
I grabbed the first thing.

547
00:52:52,729 --> 00:52:54,242
Look, look.

548
00:53:01,169 --> 00:53:06,118
When we get into New York, I don<i>'</i>t
want posters, I want billboards.

549
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:09,566
I want you to blanket Times Square.
And full page ads in the <i>Times.</i>

550
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:14,087
Got that? In the <i>Times.</i>
And I want plugs from Winchell.

551
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:18,368
You don<i>'</i>t know what a billboard
is gonna cost.

552
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:20,759
What are you, a banker?

553
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:22,522
Give me a cigarette.

554
00:53:23,529 --> 00:53:25,042
We<i>'</i>ll bring in a hit.

555
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:40,126
He<i>'</i>s out there!

556
00:58:40,529 --> 00:58:43,362
He<i>'</i>s with some 18-year-old,
but he<i>'</i>s out there.

557
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:47,158
Get me out of this!
He<i>'</i>ll be here in two minutes.

558
00:58:47,409 --> 00:58:51,368
I don<i>'</i>t wanna wear that black thing.
No, I hate it!

559
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:53,247
You gotta put something on.

560
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:54,842
- Fanny.
- What?

561
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:57,159
- He<i>'</i>s coming!
- Is he alone?

562
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:03,318
He ditched her! Quick, open the door!
Oh, this goddamn makeup!

563
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:06,879
Jesus, I got a run in my stockings.

564
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:18,443
Hello, Fanny.

565
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:24,605
Why, Nick, how good it is to see you.

566
00:59:25,209 --> 00:59:27,439
All the world changes but you.

567
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:32,368
Over a year I<i>'</i>ve been
practising that line.

568
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:39,323
You want a drink or something?
You want a cigarette?

569
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:41,925
I<i>'</i>ll call Adele. What do you want?

570
00:59:42,169 --> 00:59:46,640
I don<i>'</i>t want a drink,
and I don<i>'</i>t want Adele.

571
00:59:50,769 --> 00:59:52,964
Is that for me?

572
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,038
Don<i>'</i>t open it now.

573
01:00:01,609 --> 01:00:04,328
Fanny, I...

574
01:00:09,169 --> 01:00:12,241
When you<i>'</i>re a star,
everything you do is magic.

575
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:16,801
You don<i>'</i>t have to entertain me, Fanny.
It isn<i>'</i>t necessary.

576
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:23,318
- I can<i>'</i>t say how good it is to see you.
- Try.

577
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,963
Wait a minute.
I gotta do my number first, okay?

578
01:00:40,289 --> 01:00:44,726
Explain to me why I can<i>'</i>t remember
one thing I was gonna say.

579
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:51,286
I<i>'</i>ll remember my lines if I
just don<i>'</i>t have to look at you.

580
01:00:51,729 --> 01:00:53,082
I<i>'</i>ll remember.

581
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:59,886
- Fanny, I want to talk to you.
- You don<i>'</i>t have lines here. My turn.

582
01:01:08,009 --> 01:01:10,842
Nicky Arnstein, I love you so much.

583
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,408
I don<i>'</i>t blame you for divorcing me.

584
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:19,921
You got hit by this steam engine
the papers called Fanny Brice.

585
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:23,121
By this made-up person
the papers made up.

586
01:01:24,529 --> 01:01:29,205
And I can understand how you really
had to dig yourself out. I really can.

587
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:33,717
But I want to get off, Nicky.

588
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:40,802
I just want to climb into
your back pocket and stay there.

589
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:45,078
- Fanny.
- Just stay there all the time.

590
01:01:57,289 --> 01:01:58,768
You<i>'</i>re married.

591
01:02:01,609 --> 01:02:04,123
I just didn<i>'</i>t know how to tell you.

592
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:15,968
- When?
- Three months ago.

593
01:02:19,729 --> 01:02:21,526
To that girl?

594
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:26,485
That beautiful girl I saw you
sitting next to tonight?

595
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:31,366
My wife was sitting on my other side.

596
01:02:32,409 --> 01:02:34,127
That old lady?

597
01:02:35,929 --> 01:02:37,726
She<i>'</i>s 43.

598
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:42,879
Forty-three and loaded, right?

599
01:02:53,689 --> 01:02:56,726
I<i>'</i>ll always love you very much, Fanny.

600
01:03:21,609 --> 01:03:23,008
Who<i>'</i>s that?

601
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:28,877
We just wanted to congratulate her.

602
01:03:29,129 --> 01:03:31,597
Miss Brice isn<i>'</i>t dressed yet.

603
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:34,517
She all right?

604
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:38,125
She said you should go on
to the party without her.

605
01:03:41,249 --> 01:03:43,683
Take it. Go ahead.

606
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:47,521
It<i>'</i>s for you.

607
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:56,688
- She<i>'</i>s from Philadelphia. Here, Adele.
- Thanks.

608
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:59,602
She<i>'</i>s got $12 million.

609
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:05,437
She has an apartment in Paris,
a house in Antibes.

610
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,118
And she<i>'</i>s got a yacht.

611
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:14,560
So Nick can teach her
how to be Ionely in all of them.

612
01:04:14,969 --> 01:04:18,120
Opening night present.

613
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:28,086
He must<i>'</i>ve spent
a whole week<i>'</i>s allowance.

614
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:30,524
Hey, did you see that?

615
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:34,487
It came wrapped around the record.

616
01:04:34,729 --> 01:04:36,526
Yeah, from the company.

617
01:04:36,929 --> 01:04:39,727
Boy, it<i>'</i>s been a swell opening night.

618
01:04:40,769 --> 01:04:41,918
Fanny...

619
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:44,921
...I<i>'</i>m sorry.

620
01:04:46,809 --> 01:04:48,322
I know you are, kid.

621
01:04:49,209 --> 01:04:52,519
Go to the party without me.
I<i>'</i>ll be along later.

622
01:04:52,769 --> 01:04:57,206
I just want a few minutes.
You too, Adele.

623
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:21,684
Why don<i>'</i>t you just shut up!

624
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:45,124
<i>Ain't she got fun</i>

625
01:05:46,169 --> 01:05:48,125
<i>She's the luckiest one</i>

626
01:05:48,369 --> 01:05:52,521
<i>Satin on my shoulder</i>
<i>And a smile on my lips</i>

627
01:05:52,769 --> 01:05:55,761
<i>How lucky can you get?</i>

628
01:05:56,209 --> 01:06:00,361
<i>Money in my pocket</i>
<i>Right at my fingertips</i>

629
01:06:00,609 --> 01:06:03,328
<i>How lucky can you get?</i>

630
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:07,160
<i>Every night a party</i>
<i>Where the fun never ends</i>

631
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:11,482
<i>You can circle the globe</i>
<i>With my circle of friends</i>

632
01:06:11,729 --> 01:06:15,688
<i>Someone I am crazy for</i>
<i>Is crazy for me</i>

633
01:06:15,929 --> 01:06:22,721
<i>I'm his personal pet</i>
<i>Wow, how lucky can you get?</i>

634
01:06:29,729 --> 01:06:33,961
<i>Wrap it up and charge it</i>
<i>That's my favourite phrase</i>

635
01:06:34,209 --> 01:06:37,121
<i>How lucky can you get?</i>

636
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:41,840
<i>When I see the chauffeur</i>
<i>Think I'll give him a raise</i>

637
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:44,728
<i>How lucky can you get?</i>

638
01:06:45,449 --> 01:06:48,919
<i>Weekends in the country</i>
<i>With a baron of course</i>

639
01:06:49,169 --> 01:06:53,162
<i>And a wardrobe to choke</i>
<i>Mrs. Astor's pet horse</i>

640
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:57,004
<i>Making merry music</i>
<i>With the one that I love</i>

641
01:06:57,249 --> 01:07:00,321
<i>We're a perfect duet</i>

642
01:07:07,209 --> 01:07:09,120
Can you get!

643
01:07:24,569 --> 01:07:27,925
<i>Satin on my shoulder</i>

644
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:33,198

653
01:08:41,929 --> 01:08:43,920
<i>Big success</i>

654
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:49,719
<i>What's your secret, gorgeous</i>

655
01:08:50,049 --> 01:08:54,600
<i>Just lucky I guess</i>

656
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:01,123
You want to know
what it<i>'</i>s really like?

657
01:09:02,289 --> 01:09:06,043
Fantastic.

658
01:09:06,489 --> 01:09:10,118
<i>Satin on my shoulder</i>

<i>You can spare me the blues</i>

664

<i>I don't sing in that key</i>

666
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:40,521

<i>How lucky can you get?</i>

671
01:10:30,009 --> 01:10:32,887
Look, just look at that.
It<i>'</i>s worse than ever.

672
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:38,321
Fanny? Fanny.

673
01:10:39,809 --> 01:10:43,802
- Oh, my God, look! Is that Buck?
- No, C.V. Silverstein.

674
01:10:44,049 --> 01:10:46,563
Silverstein from
the Silverstein Movie Studios?

675
01:10:47,089 --> 01:10:48,727
Come visit me in California.

676
01:10:50,089 --> 01:10:51,966
Hey, push off with Bobby.

677
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:55,042
I wanna talk to Fanny.
Alone for once, okay?

678
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:58,326
Come on, I wanna show you
something. Come on.

679
01:10:59,409 --> 01:11:00,398
48th and 10th.

680
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:07,760
It<i>'</i>s a theatre-cabaret.
I<i>'</i>m gonna call it the Casa Mańana.

681
01:11:08,009 --> 01:11:10,569
That<i>'</i>s Mex for <i>"</i> House of Tomorrow.<i>"</i>

682
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:16,441
What, you gonna play a fair in Texas?
You already got our show.

683
01:11:17,849 --> 01:11:19,521
They<i>'</i>ll pay me 100,000 bucks.

684
01:11:19,769 --> 01:11:23,125
It<i>'</i>s a big deal, the Texas Centennial.

685
01:11:29,769 --> 01:11:31,327
It<i>'</i>s nice.

686
01:11:33,449 --> 01:11:34,928
Here, look.

687
01:11:39,689 --> 01:11:41,122
Classy, huh?

688
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:46,604
- Too classy?
- Too classy for what? Buffalos?

689
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:50,319
I got some fan dancers.

690
01:11:52,769 --> 01:11:57,445
- How you fixed for feathers?
- You<i>'</i>re always on the hustle, Billy.

691
01:11:57,689 --> 01:12:00,999
So how long are you gonna
be down there?

692
01:12:01,249 --> 01:12:02,602
Why, what do you care?

693
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:07,322
I<i>'</i>m used to you.
You<i>'</i>re good for laughs.

694
01:12:10,169 --> 01:12:12,683
It<i>'</i>s hot in here.

695
01:12:15,809 --> 01:12:18,881
This thing<i>'</i>s gotta be a spectacle.

696
01:12:19,249 --> 01:12:22,127
I<i>'</i>m gonna get 50 girls in here.

697
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:25,202
They<i>'</i>re all gonna be 5<i>'</i>10<i>"</i> or bigger.

698
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:30,477
And, the closing number,
I was thinking of all white.

699
01:12:35,249 --> 01:12:37,968
Maybe a wedding routine.

700
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:40,643
Very impressive.

701
01:12:45,369 --> 01:12:48,327
How<i>'</i>d you like to star
in a wedding bit?

702
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,120
I paid retail.

703
01:13:05,329 --> 01:13:10,323
You want the goddamn ring or not?
Speak up, I got a rehearsal.

704
01:13:15,489 --> 01:13:18,959
- You<i>'</i>re asking me to marry you?
- Yeah.

705
01:13:19,209 --> 01:13:20,847
- I mean serious?
- Yeah!

706
01:13:21,089 --> 01:13:26,209
And I<i>'</i>m not gonna ask you again.
So right now, yes or no? Yes or no?

707
01:13:36,129 --> 01:13:38,324
It ought to work out fine.

708
01:13:41,289 --> 01:13:42,438
You saying yeah?

709
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:46,284
I<i>'</i>m saying yeah.

710
01:14:09,489 --> 01:14:12,526
I got a little confession to make.

711
01:14:13,489 --> 01:14:17,084
I never borrowed money
from the mob, like I told you.

712
01:14:19,609 --> 01:14:24,125
You bastard.
Making me think they had you on ice.

713
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:30,762
It was a very good argument.
You bought it.

714
01:14:32,169 --> 01:14:35,081
Only by now, you should know better.

715
01:14:37,169 --> 01:14:40,798
I wouldn<i>'</i>t want you to think
you married dumb.

716
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:54,368
Darling...

717
01:14:54,929 --> 01:14:56,203
...I do adore you.

718
01:14:56,409 --> 01:15:00,322
But you are absolutely mad.
Tell me, why him?

719
01:15:02,329 --> 01:15:04,638
I fell in like with him.

720
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,439
Do you have a light?

721
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:12,728
Here.

722
01:15:15,169 --> 01:15:18,923
Oh! Did you see what that man did?

723
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:30,837
It is a crunch.

724
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:35,844
My wife, however, is determined
to speak to Miss Brice.

725
01:15:36,089 --> 01:15:38,557
- Do you know her?
- I married her.

726
01:15:38,809 --> 01:15:40,720
Of course. You must be...

727
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:45,121
Rose. Billy Rose. Rose.

728
01:15:48,809 --> 01:15:53,280
- Crude little bastard.
- Screw him, he<i>'</i>s only in on a pass.

729
01:15:59,129 --> 01:16:02,087
- Have a nice evening, Mr. Brice.
- Rose.

730
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:09,163
No action in the club car?

731
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:15,120
How many times I gotta tell you
that I am not a gambler?

732
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:23,523
- Did you do your knees yet?
- No, I<i>'</i>m coming to them.

733
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:26,920
I thought you did your knees
before your heels.

734
01:16:27,609 --> 01:16:31,158
I do the heels first.
Then I do the knees.

735
01:16:31,409 --> 01:16:33,320
- Every night.
- Every night.

736
01:16:39,809 --> 01:16:44,360
By the time you finish that
production, I get all mixed up.

737
01:16:44,609 --> 01:16:45,678
Mixed up what?

738
01:16:45,929 --> 01:16:48,045
I don<i>'</i>t know what I should go for.

739
01:16:48,289 --> 01:16:52,123
I figure, maybe there<i>'</i>s
something I don<i>'</i>t know about.

740
01:16:52,369 --> 01:16:57,648
Maybe I<i>'</i>m supposed to go do something
to your goddamn knees or heels.

741
01:17:05,969 --> 01:17:08,119
You put perfume behind your knees?

742
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:11,518
- You never did that before.
- Yes, I did.

743
01:17:14,209 --> 01:17:17,121
Maybe I<i>'</i>m right.
I should go for your knees?

744
01:17:17,369 --> 01:17:20,281
Will you forget about the knees?

745
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:25,444
We<i>'</i>re gonna arrive in Fort Worth
at 7 a.m. Let<i>'</i>s get some sleep.

746
01:17:31,409 --> 01:17:33,604
The heels before the knees.

747
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:37,444
The knees after the heels,
before the elbows.

748
01:17:39,649 --> 01:17:41,879
After the knees.

749
01:18:29,729 --> 01:18:33,563
Hang up your pants. You<i>'</i>ll get
there looking like two bits.

750
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:39,367
- I<i>'</i>ll get them pressed.
- Why not just hang them up?

751
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,323
Did Nick always hang up his pants?

752
01:18:50,449 --> 01:18:53,327
- Yes.
- I<i>'</i>ll pay the buck.

753
01:18:55,609 --> 01:18:59,238
Flinging your clothes
makes the room look like a dump.

754
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:04,688
I<i>'</i>ve never been in a train for three
days with goddamn royalty. Here!

755
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:15,041
How come you never go to the can?
In the theatre you used to.

756
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:17,086
It<i>'</i>s none of your damn business.

757
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:19,524
How come now we<i>'</i>re married...

758
01:19:19,769 --> 01:19:23,239
...and you never go to the can?!

759
01:19:23,489 --> 01:19:27,607
How do you think I feel having
to go to the can all the time?

760
01:19:27,849 --> 01:19:30,682
You don<i>'</i>t like being
cooped up with me...

761
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:33,841
...there<i>'</i>s an empty compartment.
Hire it.

762
01:19:34,089 --> 01:19:36,808
I won<i>'</i>t have to look
at your crummy pajamas.

763
01:19:37,049 --> 01:19:39,005
What<i>'</i>s wrong with them?

764
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:41,604
I hate your pajamas! They<i>'</i>re terrible.

765
01:19:41,849 --> 01:19:45,558
Well, I hate your lemons!

766
01:19:45,809 --> 01:19:50,803
And I hate your fancy bed junk!

767
01:19:51,129 --> 01:19:54,883
And where, where, tell me, where...

768
01:19:55,329 --> 01:19:59,800
...do you come off reading
a French magazine on our honeymoon?

769
01:20:00,049 --> 01:20:01,880
I know you can<i>'</i>t read French!

770
01:20:02,129 --> 01:20:05,007
I look at the pictures, creep!
I learn what goes!

771
01:20:05,249 --> 01:20:08,082
One thing that<i>'</i>ll never go
is your pajamas!

772
01:20:08,609 --> 01:20:13,808
Screw my pajamas! Screw them!
And screw you, lady! And...

773
01:20:16,329 --> 01:20:17,728
- What?
- Oh, God...

774
01:20:18,849 --> 01:20:20,999
What<i>'</i>s the matter?

775
01:20:22,369 --> 01:20:25,759
Gave me a nosebleed.
You gave me a goddamn nosebleed.

776
01:20:34,969 --> 01:20:37,722
Hold it, hold it, there.
I<i>'</i>ll get some ice.

777
01:20:43,289 --> 01:20:45,120
Okay, here.

778
01:20:48,489 --> 01:20:50,559
If you bleed on my good gown...

779
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:53,767
When I stop, I<i>'</i>m gonna belt you one.

780
01:20:55,049 --> 01:20:56,528
Tough guy.

781
01:21:00,809 --> 01:21:03,118
Kid, you are some nut.

782
01:21:06,089 --> 01:21:07,522
Let me see.

783
01:21:15,969 --> 01:21:19,928
- Just lie still.
- You know the trouble, Fanny?

784
01:21:21,569 --> 01:21:26,563
The trouble is that I love you.
I love you.

785
01:21:31,449 --> 01:21:36,318
You could<i>'</i>ve told me. Put your
best foot forward for the hell of it.

786
01:23:50,209 --> 01:23:55,283
I<i>'</i>m gonna take you to Sulka<i>'</i>s and
have some pajamas made for you.

787
01:23:57,769 --> 01:24:01,284
- They<i>'</i>ll make pajamas for you?
- Sure.

788
01:24:01,529 --> 01:24:05,124
Just like shirts.
They make underwear too so it fits.

789
01:24:05,369 --> 01:24:09,647
You ain<i>'</i>t getting me measured
for no BVDs.

790
01:24:09,889 --> 01:24:13,006
Pajamas maybe, but no BVDs.

791
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:17,608
Okay, okay. Go back to sleep.

792
01:25:17,809 --> 01:25:22,485
Billy. Billy! Shirley, will you
get me that clipping, please?

793
01:25:22,729 --> 01:25:27,484
Would you let me read it to you
first, then blow your stack?

794
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:29,720
Okay. Shirley?

795
01:25:30,409 --> 01:25:33,879
<i>"</i> Miracle Man of Broadway Billy Rose<i>'</i>s
beauteous Aqua Belle...

796
01:25:34,089 --> 01:25:37,445
...Eleanor Holm sings Circe
songs to Billy in Cleveland.

797
01:25:37,609 --> 01:25:41,124
Are you listening, Billy?
Fanny, are you listening to Billy?

798
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:45,442
Five years, five hits.
Is this your first miss?<i>"</i> Burn it.

799
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:49,967
No, I can<i>'</i>t kill a Winchell
item, Billy. You know that.

800
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:55,329
Well, what I can do is to prevent
anybody else from running with it!

801
01:25:56,529 --> 01:26:00,761
You think I don<i>'</i>t know how sore
she<i>'</i>ll be when she finds out?

802
01:26:01,009 --> 01:26:03,125
I<i>'</i>m close enough to get grabbed!

803
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:04,518
The proofs.

804
01:26:04,769 --> 01:26:08,648
His name should be in another colour.
Billy, what can I do?

805
01:26:08,889 --> 01:26:11,642
- Ned, did you order a sandwich?
- Yes.

806
01:26:11,889 --> 01:26:17,566
You and Fanny wave to each other
every six months from separate trains.

807
01:26:17,809 --> 01:26:20,562
How can I publicize that?
What should I do?

808
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:23,767
You want me to stage something
on the tracks...

809
01:26:24,009 --> 01:26:28,207
...where she flings your slippers
after you as you whiz by?

810
01:26:28,769 --> 01:26:30,646
Ned, it<i>'</i>s Miss Brice.

811
01:26:30,889 --> 01:26:35,326
Billy, Fanny<i>'</i>s on the other phone.
Tell him about the Hippodrome.

812
01:26:36,409 --> 01:26:41,244
I<i>'</i>m on the wire to Billy.
He says he<i>'</i>s very Ionely out there.

813
01:26:41,489 --> 01:26:43,844
The accountant thinks you better...

814
01:26:44,089 --> 01:26:46,478
I saw the poster, what about it?

815
01:26:46,689 --> 01:26:49,647
You want to kill the kid costume?
Okay.

816
01:26:49,889 --> 01:26:53,245
We get out a flood
of releases that you also sing.

817
01:26:53,489 --> 01:26:57,687
Big news. But if that<i>'</i>s what
you want, you got it.

818
01:26:58,009 --> 01:27:00,045
Hey, you wanna talk to Billy?
Hold on a minute.

819
01:27:01,929 --> 01:27:05,239
Billy, talk to your wife for a minute.

820
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:08,646
She<i>'</i>s leaving for California tomorrow.

821
01:27:09,929 --> 01:27:11,726
Okay, go ahead.

822
01:27:11,929 --> 01:27:13,408
<i>You'll knock them dead.</i>

823
01:27:13,649 --> 01:27:15,719
<i>I could use your advice.</i>

824
01:27:16,049 --> 01:27:21,248
<i>- I could use your advice.</i>
<i>- What about? "Circe songs?"</i>

825
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,129
<i>Don't listen, kid.</i>
<i>Put cotton in your ears.</i>

826
01:27:25,049 --> 01:27:30,806
<i>- Okay. Fran sends you her love.</i>
<i>- Give her my love. And you too, Fanny.</i>

827
01:27:31,049 --> 01:27:33,165
<i>Hang up now, let me talk to Ned.</i>

828
01:27:33,409 --> 01:27:36,321
<i>- Bye, good luck.</i>
<i>- Bye, Billy. Ned?</i>

829
01:27:38,489 --> 01:27:43,688
Yeah, Fanny? What can I do for you?
Your California train?

830
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:48,407
If it doesn<i>'</i>t go through Cleveland,
it<i>'</i>s gotta go some place near.

831
01:27:48,649 --> 01:27:52,039
Want me to check that out for you?
Sure, hold on.

832
01:27:52,289 --> 01:27:54,086
No, honey, it<i>'</i>s my pleasure.

833
01:27:59,849 --> 01:28:03,125
Billy? Billy!

834
01:28:06,969 --> 01:28:09,847
Beautiful, let me see that.
You gonna fly?

835
01:28:15,009 --> 01:28:19,127
- Mr. Rose, let<i>'</i>s go.
- It<i>'</i>s about time. Would you get...?

836
01:28:22,369 --> 01:28:25,281
I thought you were in California.

837
01:28:25,569 --> 01:28:29,084
I thought you were in Cleveland
by yourself. Introduce me.

838
01:28:29,329 --> 01:28:31,559
This is the champ, Eleanor Holm.

839
01:28:31,809 --> 01:28:35,040
- How do you do?
- Just call me Mrs. Rose.

840
01:28:35,289 --> 01:28:37,928
As long as she doesn<i>'</i>t
call me Mr. Brice.

841
01:28:38,169 --> 01:28:42,447
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, my train passed through.

842
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:45,567
I got off to check him out.
How<i>'</i>s it going?

843
01:28:45,809 --> 01:28:48,687
- Places, everybody.
- Excuse me. Back to work.

844
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:53,442
Terrific break that you showed up.

845
01:28:53,689 --> 01:28:55,725
You couldn<i>'</i>t have timed it better.

846
01:28:55,969 --> 01:28:59,245
I really think I got a hit. I feel it.

847
01:28:59,489 --> 01:29:03,402
I<i>'</i>d like to see what you think.
Any advice you could give.

848
01:29:05,489 --> 01:29:09,118
You look... That<i>'</i>s terrific.
I love that suit.

849
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:11,246
You should. It cost you $200.

850
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:13,997
Mr. Rose, we need you up there.

851
01:29:15,409 --> 01:29:18,207
It<i>'</i>s all right. Don<i>'</i>t worry about me.

852
01:29:19,129 --> 01:29:21,597
Terrific. Come here.
Here, sit here.

853
01:29:22,609 --> 01:29:25,806
You<i>'</i>ll be all right?
I<i>'</i>ll see you in a bit.

854
01:29:29,609 --> 01:29:31,406
Hit the music!

855
01:29:33,809 --> 01:29:35,208
Stand by.

856
01:29:35,969 --> 01:29:37,402
Lights.

857
01:30:14,969 --> 01:30:18,644
<i>Presenting the Billy Rose</i>
<i>Aqua Belles.</i>

858
01:31:03,369 --> 01:31:05,803
Give me a little celery tonic.

859
01:31:08,849 --> 01:31:14,048
<i>Billy Rose's new star,</i>
<i>Miss E leanor Holm.</i>

860
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:24,445
That<i>'</i>s great, Billy. Terrific!

861
01:32:56,249 --> 01:32:59,082
Hey, come here. You wanna dance?

862
01:33:38,009 --> 01:33:40,603
Your star trout<i>'</i>s got a lot of muscle.

863
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:43,283
Don<i>'</i>t let her get you in the water.

864
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:46,089
Eleanor<i>'</i>s a great kid.

865
01:33:47,129 --> 01:33:49,199
You ought to get to know her.

866
01:33:49,449 --> 01:33:52,680
Maybe we should have her
for dinner. Amandine.

867
01:33:56,169 --> 01:33:58,160
I just made a joke.

868
01:33:59,409 --> 01:34:01,559
You didn<i>'</i>t think it was funny?

869
01:34:01,809 --> 01:34:04,721
No, kidding. You got a great show.

870
01:34:04,969 --> 01:34:07,563
With an ace attraction. Ace.

871
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:12,803
- You shouldn<i>'</i>t kid a kidder, Fanny.
- What?

872
01:34:14,969 --> 01:34:19,599
- You performed for me tonight.
- What is that supposed to mean?

873
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:27,078
I know you. I know how you think.

874
01:34:28,249 --> 01:34:31,559
When you want something,
you get it by being funny.

875
01:34:31,809 --> 01:34:34,198
I<i>'</i>ve seen you do that before.

876
01:34:35,129 --> 01:34:36,960
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

877
01:34:37,209 --> 01:34:40,406
You went to a lot of trouble
to make me laugh tonight.

878
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:44,841
You got a very primitive
sense of humour, kid.

879
01:34:45,089 --> 01:34:49,128
Pratfalls, dropped drawers,
drowning bits.

880
01:34:52,449 --> 01:34:55,566
You know, I got a terrific idea.

881
01:34:55,809 --> 01:35:00,963
I don<i>'</i>t know if it would work,
but see what you think.

882
01:35:01,289 --> 01:35:05,680
- What<i>'</i>s on your mind, kid?
- Why don<i>'</i>t we get married?

883
01:35:09,089 --> 01:35:11,205
We got married.

884
01:35:14,129 --> 01:35:18,361
No, I mean, really be married.
Really married.

885
01:35:21,369 --> 01:35:26,568
Mrs. Rose is the name and chicken soup
is the game. Is that what you want?

886
01:35:40,969 --> 01:35:43,403
What I want is...

887
01:35:46,649 --> 01:35:51,404
...I want you to do more
of what you did tonight.

888
01:35:51,929 --> 01:35:57,049
Brush off a broad if you think
she<i>'</i>s getting too close.

889
01:35:59,289 --> 01:36:05,922
You remember a long time ago,
you made me say I need you?

890
01:36:10,329 --> 01:36:12,206
That<i>'</i>s what I want.

891
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:19,162
I want you to need me.
I mean, really need me.

892
01:36:27,169 --> 01:36:29,808
Need me.

893
01:36:36,529 --> 01:36:38,997
You got some sexy ears, honey.

894
01:36:40,369 --> 01:36:42,803
I think I<i>'</i>ll stick diamonds in them.

895
01:37:03,169 --> 01:37:05,000
I need you.

896
01:37:07,649 --> 01:37:09,207
I need you.

897
01:37:11,009 --> 01:37:13,204
I need you.

898
01:37:20,809 --> 01:37:25,803
<i>Life, Colliers, Esquire, Stage</i>?

899
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:27,004
What is this?

900
01:37:27,249 --> 01:37:28,967
<i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>?

901
01:37:29,289 --> 01:37:32,679
You shouldn<i>'</i>t get bored
and pick up strange men.

902
01:37:32,929 --> 01:37:34,806
Are there any other kind?

903
01:37:36,729 --> 01:37:41,678
Billy, will you call me every night?
Reverse the charges, if you want.

904
01:37:41,929 --> 01:37:46,286
Don<i>'</i>t be a chump. I got a new system
for beating the phone company.

905
01:37:46,529 --> 01:37:48,008
All aboard.

906
01:37:48,849 --> 01:37:51,363
I<i>'</i>m a mess, huh?

907
01:37:53,609 --> 01:37:57,602
All aboard.
Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.

908
01:38:01,529 --> 01:38:03,599
I<i>'</i>m gonna get you a bigger ring.

909
01:38:04,289 --> 01:38:06,405
- All right.
- So long, Billy.

910
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:09,402
All aboard.

911
01:38:12,889 --> 01:38:14,208
Billy?

912
01:38:16,209 --> 01:38:18,006
Don<i>'</i>t go near the water.

913
01:38:24,449 --> 01:38:28,237
Norma, I cancelled the <i>Baby Snooks</i>
rehearsal to come here?

914
01:38:30,049 --> 01:38:33,325
What is this?
I get paid for wearing costumes.

915
01:38:33,569 --> 01:38:37,448
Stop <i>"</i> kwetching.<i>"</i>
You<i>'</i>re gonna just love it.

916
01:38:37,689 --> 01:38:42,080
- We got seats next to the field.
- Hi-Ho Silverstein, right?

917
01:38:42,849 --> 01:38:44,680
Oh, Fanny!

918
01:38:46,289 --> 01:38:48,245
So this is Beverly Hills.

919
01:38:51,289 --> 01:38:55,567
You can<i>'</i>t catch up with the goyim.
When you think you learned it...

920
01:38:55,769 --> 01:38:58,158
...they come with sticks and hookers.

921
01:38:58,329 --> 01:39:01,082
- Chukkas.
- <i>"</i> Chukkas?<i>"</i>

922
01:39:03,489 --> 01:39:08,688
Oh, I wish Billy was here.
Billy loves baloney.

923
01:39:31,649 --> 01:39:35,767
When Norma promises you<i>'</i>ll be excited,
you<i>'</i>ll be excited.

924
01:39:37,809 --> 01:39:40,721
- You know Nick?
- Nick?

925
01:39:41,009 --> 01:39:45,366
Oh, Fanny, you don<i>'</i>t think I planned
anything. He just was here.

926
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:48,919
Thank God you never
had to learn to act.

927
01:39:50,249 --> 01:39:53,366
I wanna know if he knows I<i>'</i>m here.

928
01:39:53,609 --> 01:39:56,601
I<i>'</i>m absolutely certain he<i>'</i>d want to.

929
01:40:00,849 --> 01:40:04,967
I<i>'</i>ll see you kids later.
I<i>'</i>ll send the car back.

930
01:40:12,049 --> 01:40:14,324
Quit while you<i>'</i>re ahead.

931
01:40:14,569 --> 01:40:17,720
Don<i>'</i>t try to walk on the water, kid.

932
01:40:18,769 --> 01:40:23,160
Why don<i>'</i>t you come on out here?
I<i>'</i>ll send you a return ticket.

933
01:40:23,409 --> 01:40:29,279
You want a private car? I<i>'</i>ll give my
body to Huntington Hartford. Come on.

934
01:40:34,089 --> 01:40:35,886
No, I<i>'</i>m okay.

935
01:40:36,769 --> 01:40:40,842
No, I really am.
I just miss you, kid. That<i>'</i>s all.

936
01:40:43,289 --> 01:40:47,328
Look, if I get too Ionely,
I<i>'</i>ll send for Fran, right?

937
01:40:48,729 --> 01:40:50,481
Yeah, sure.

938
01:40:52,729 --> 01:40:57,280
No, don<i>'</i>t be silly.
Of course I understand.

939
01:40:58,609 --> 01:41:02,887
I<i>'</i>ll talk to you next week, huh?
Maybe sooner.

940
01:41:08,649 --> 01:41:09,877
Me too.

941
01:41:12,449 --> 01:41:14,280
So long, Billy.

942
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:16,882
I<i>'</i>ll see you.

943
01:41:24,729 --> 01:41:26,879
Goddamn it!

944
01:43:53,889 --> 01:43:57,245
And the thing is...

945
01:43:58,089 --> 01:44:01,286
...I guess I wanna see him,
talk to him.

946
01:44:01,529 --> 01:44:03,599
Just do what you want!

947
01:44:19,369 --> 01:44:21,087
How are you, kid?

948
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:27,280
I<i>'</i>m not sure.
A little nervous, I think.

949
01:44:27,609 --> 01:44:29,486
Me too.

950
01:44:30,489 --> 01:44:32,559
Like always.

951
01:44:34,049 --> 01:44:37,280
Did you ever think about directing?
You got the wardrobe.

952
01:44:40,969 --> 01:44:45,565
- You look ravishing, old girl.
- You look ravishing too.

953
01:44:47,609 --> 01:44:50,840
Didn<i>'</i>t have time to change
out of your polo clothes?

954
01:44:51,089 --> 01:44:55,879
Oh, yes, I had plenty of time.
I tried to decide what I should wear.

955
01:44:56,129 --> 01:45:00,361
I looked in the mirror and saw
how becoming this outfit was.

956
01:45:00,609 --> 01:45:03,681
So I just took a shower
and put on the same.

957
01:45:03,929 --> 01:45:08,480
- I thought I might get by with it.
- A new trick, telling the truth.

958
01:45:24,729 --> 01:45:26,287
What are you thinking?

959
01:45:28,569 --> 01:45:30,639
I was just remembering...

960
01:45:33,249 --> 01:45:36,241
...when I first went out with you.

961
01:45:37,009 --> 01:45:39,967
I was still living home with Mama.

962
01:45:40,209 --> 01:45:44,043
I used to sleep
in the same bed with her, and...

963
01:45:44,969 --> 01:45:49,565
...once in the middle of the night
I woke up kissing her.

964
01:45:49,809 --> 01:45:52,642
Then she woke up and said,
<i>"</i>This ain<i>'</i>t Nick.<i>"</i>

965
01:45:54,409 --> 01:45:57,003
That<i>'</i>s what I was thinking.

966
01:46:02,769 --> 01:46:04,805
How is your mother?

967
01:46:05,569 --> 01:46:09,642
She sold the saloons.
She lives in Lakewood, New Jersey.

968
01:46:10,009 --> 01:46:14,878
- She likes Billy.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Rose.

969
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:19,684
How is Mr. Rose?

970
01:46:20,689 --> 01:46:23,487
He keeps busy. How about you?

971
01:46:23,729 --> 01:46:26,289
When you come down off your horse?

972
01:46:26,849 --> 01:46:30,364
When I come off my horse,
there<i>'</i>s the yacht and...

973
01:46:30,609 --> 01:46:36,525
...a 13th-century palazzo we<i>'</i>re
rebuilding in Cap D<i>'</i>Antibe.

974
01:46:36,769 --> 01:46:40,125
The problems of dismantling
are just staggering.

975
01:46:40,369 --> 01:46:43,486
I like dismantling
much better than mantling.

976
01:46:44,609 --> 01:46:48,158
- Still the same Fanny.
- You expecting Mrs. Roosevelt?

977
01:46:48,409 --> 01:46:53,005
I was expecting Fanny.
Hoping for Fanny.

978
01:46:56,849 --> 01:47:02,003
You know, Fanny, the only trouble
we had was money.

979
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:04,479
That<i>'</i>s not a problem now.

980
01:47:05,569 --> 01:47:08,879
No problem for you or for your wife?

981
01:47:09,209 --> 01:47:11,598
No problem for either of us.

982
01:47:11,849 --> 01:47:15,683
If I walk away,
I walk away with a very large stake.

983
01:47:22,609 --> 01:47:25,282
How you fixed for toothbrushes, kid?

984
01:47:29,569 --> 01:47:31,082
Oh, God!

985
01:47:34,449 --> 01:47:38,078
I remember that first time
in Baltimore.

986
01:47:40,569 --> 01:47:44,278
When I went up to your hotel room.

987
01:47:45,729 --> 01:47:48,482
And I went into your bathroom.

988
01:47:52,449 --> 01:47:55,486
Jesus! You had seven toothbrushes.

989
01:47:57,289 --> 01:48:00,884
Seven. I guess one for every day
in the week.

990
01:48:01,129 --> 01:48:06,283
And you had this big wooden bowl
with soap in it.

991
01:48:06,729 --> 01:48:11,484
<i>"</i> By Appointment to His Majesty<i>"</i>
it says on the bowl.

992
01:48:13,769 --> 01:48:18,889
Royal soap. And hanging on the
door were these silk pajamas.

993
01:48:19,329 --> 01:48:21,479
Red, with...

994
01:48:22,409 --> 01:48:26,288
...a monogram, real tiny, tiny.

995
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:29,284
That small.

996
01:48:32,649 --> 01:48:34,287
Class.

997
01:48:38,249 --> 01:48:41,844
Boy, did I come out of
that bathroom with personality.

998
01:48:43,769 --> 01:48:45,885
I was all over the place...

999
01:48:49,249 --> 01:48:53,083
...because I fell in love
with those toothbrushes.

1000
01:49:11,729 --> 01:49:15,404
Still have seven
toothbrushes, Fanny.

1001
01:49:55,329 --> 01:49:58,287
And all these years...

1002
01:50:00,289 --> 01:50:03,087
...I<i>'</i>ve been in love with nothing
but a set of...

1003
01:50:04,129 --> 01:50:06,689
...goddamn toothbrushes.

1004
01:50:11,609 --> 01:50:14,487
You have a daughter, you know.

1005
01:50:15,169 --> 01:50:18,605
You haven<i>'</i>t seen her in six years.

1006
01:50:18,849 --> 01:50:23,047
And you don<i>'</i>t even think to ask
about her. You ask about Mama...

1007
01:50:23,289 --> 01:50:28,283
...but you don<i>'</i>t inquire about your
own daughter, you son of a bitch.

1008
01:50:31,489 --> 01:50:34,128
- How is Fran?
- She<i>'</i>s great.

1009
01:50:34,369 --> 01:50:37,805
She keeps your picture
next to her bed.

1010
01:50:38,169 --> 01:50:42,208
- She does? Which one?
- What do you care? They<i>'</i>re all great.

1011
01:50:42,449 --> 01:50:46,761
The money trouble we had is what
you thought it<i>'</i>d take the place of.

1012
01:50:47,009 --> 01:50:52,083
If you<i>'</i>ll excuse me.
Bobby, say hi to Nick before he goes.

1013
01:50:56,649 --> 01:50:59,163
Just ring for your horse.

1014
01:51:06,209 --> 01:51:08,928
<i>Well, I'll be damned</i>

1015
01:51:10,929 --> 01:51:13,727
<i>No I won't be damned</i>

1016
01:51:15,609 --> 01:51:19,966
<i>Because I have been damned</i>

1017
01:51:20,329 --> 01:51:22,763
<i>But I won't be damned anymore</i>

1018
01:51:27,489 --> 01:51:30,049
<i>I walked out</i>

1019
01:51:31,969 --> 01:51:35,279
<i>He didn't walk out</i>

1020
01:51:35,729 --> 01:51:39,119
<i>It was me who walked out</i>

1021
01:51:39,569 --> 01:51:44,723
<i>It was me</i>
<i>Closing the door</i>

1022
01:51:48,209 --> 01:51:51,201
<i>Blow the bugle</i>

1023
01:51:51,449 --> 01:51:54,441
<i>Sound the cymbal</i>

1024
01:51:54,689 --> 01:51:57,283
<i>All my troubles fill a thimble</i>

1025
01:51:57,529 --> 01:52:00,407
<i>I'm as happy as it's legal to be</i>

1026
01:52:00,649 --> 01:52:05,484
<i>Come on, kids</i>
<i>Let's hear it for me</i>

1027
01:52:05,729 --> 01:52:08,766
<i>Get the tom-tom</i>

1028
01:52:09,009 --> 01:52:11,921
<i>Start the drumming</i>

1029
01:52:12,209 --> 01:52:14,928
<i>Cue the chorus</i>
<i>Keep 'em humming</i>

1030
01:52:15,169 --> 01:52:18,320
<i>'Cause I'm climbing off</i>
<i>The limb of that tree</i>

1031
01:52:18,569 --> 01:52:22,562
<i>Come on, kids</i>
<i>Let's hear it for me</i>

1032
01:52:22,849 --> 01:52:26,000
<i>For this overwhelming sensation</i>

1033
01:52:26,249 --> 01:52:29,082
<i>I could stand a standing ovation</i>

1034
01:52:29,329 --> 01:52:32,878
<i>Give my entrance cue</i>
<i>To the band and</i>

1035
01:52:33,129 --> 01:52:37,520
<i>Give the little lady</i>
<i>A great big hand</i>

1036
01:52:39,649 --> 01:52:43,847
<i>Slide the trombone</i>

1037
01:52:44,089 --> 01:52:47,365
<i>Let it swell out</i>

1038
01:52:47,609 --> 01:52:52,478
<i>This performance is a sell-out</i>
<i>And the critics and the public agree</i>

1039
01:52:52,729 --> 01:52:55,641
<i>I'm the number one</i>
<i>Attraction to see</i>

1040
01:52:55,889 --> 01:52:58,278
<i>So applaud it and cheer it</i>

1041
01:52:58,529 --> 01:53:03,683
<i>Come on, now</i>
<i>Let's hear it for me</i>

1042
01:53:21,249 --> 01:53:24,559
<i>Standing in the wings</i>

1043
01:53:24,809 --> 01:53:27,118
<i>All prepared to start</i>

1044
01:53:27,849 --> 01:53:30,761
<i>U sually I'm tense</i>

1045
01:53:31,009 --> 01:53:34,160
<i>A pounding in my heart</i>

1046
01:53:34,409 --> 01:53:37,401
<i>But now I'm not afraid</i>

1047
01:53:37,649 --> 01:53:40,561
<i>Those butterflies are gone</i>

1048
01:53:40,809 --> 01:53:42,640
<i>My act is looking great</i>

1049
01:53:42,889 --> 01:53:47,201
<i>I can't wait to go on</i>

1050
01:53:52,369 --> 01:53:56,885
<i>Grab a ticket</i>
<i>Find your row, kid</i>

1051
01:53:57,129 --> 01:54:00,246
<i>I am strictly SRO, kid</i>

1052
01:54:00,489 --> 01:54:03,561
<i>Tell those oogly-boogly feelings</i>
<i>I'm free</i>

1053
01:54:03,809 --> 01:54:06,687
<i>They've been banished</i>
<i>By a royal decree</i>

1054
01:54:06,929 --> 01:54:10,444
<i>And your head feels so good</i>
<i>When you finally clear it</i>

1055
01:54:10,689 --> 01:54:13,408
<i>If I saw a worry</i>
<i>I wouldn't go near it</i>

1056
01:54:13,649 --> 01:54:16,288
<i>Come on, now</i>

1057
01:54:16,569 --> 01:54:19,402
<i>Come on, kids</i>

1058
01:54:19,649 --> 01:54:24,518
<i>Let's hear it</i>

1059
01:54:25,049 --> 01:54:29,565
<i>Let's hear it for me</i>

1060
01:54:43,329 --> 01:54:45,524
<i>This is WYXY Cleveland.</i>

1061
01:54:45,769 --> 01:54:50,285
<i>Here is Shep Fields</i>
<i>with one of your favourites.</i>

1062
01:55:07,569 --> 01:55:08,968
Billy.

1063
01:55:09,929 --> 01:55:13,478
- Oh, Miss Brice!
- Oh, Jesus! Fanny!

1064
01:55:17,609 --> 01:55:21,079
So just don<i>'</i>t lay there, honey.
Swim something.

1065
01:56:07,089 --> 01:56:10,206
You always were a fast dresser.

1066
01:56:10,569 --> 01:56:13,686
Sloppy, but fast.

1067
01:56:16,329 --> 01:56:18,524
Fix your tie.

1068
01:56:24,289 --> 01:56:26,086
Can I sit down?

1069
01:56:26,889 --> 01:56:28,481
Yeah, sit.

1070
01:56:37,929 --> 01:56:40,762
Alone at last.

1071
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:47,363
That was like a crummy
burlesque sketch.

1072
01:56:49,849 --> 01:56:53,319
I<i>'</i>m sorry, Fanny. I<i>'</i>m sorry.

1073
01:56:57,289 --> 01:57:02,079
You know, I flew all the way
to Cleveland in a plane.

1074
01:57:03,689 --> 01:57:07,284
I had to get here fast
so I could tell you my news.

1075
01:57:09,809 --> 01:57:12,164
What news?

1076
01:57:12,729 --> 01:57:15,527
I should have phoned.

1077
01:57:15,769 --> 01:57:17,282
What news?

1078
01:57:24,929 --> 01:57:27,489
I wanted to be with you
when I told you.

1079
01:57:29,369 --> 01:57:31,485
It<i>'</i>s all over with Nick.

1080
01:57:33,049 --> 01:57:35,483
I mean it, really over.

1081
01:57:37,329 --> 01:57:38,682
Look, Billy.

1082
01:57:39,969 --> 01:57:45,089
It<i>'</i>s okay. You see,
I figure what happened...

1083
01:57:45,329 --> 01:57:48,958
...was because I called you
and I wanted to see Nick...

1084
01:57:49,209 --> 01:57:53,168
...and you got sore at me.
You figured, screw her.

1085
01:57:53,889 --> 01:57:57,848
And I don<i>'</i>t blame you.
I don<i>'</i>t blame you. I mean it.

1086
01:57:58,849 --> 01:58:00,680
You<i>'</i>re entitled.

1087
01:58:01,929 --> 01:58:03,806
So let<i>'</i>s negotiate.

1088
01:58:05,609 --> 01:58:09,284
I<i>'</i>m willing to forget it
if you<i>'</i>re willing to forget it.

1089
01:58:10,049 --> 01:58:11,607
Fair?

1090
01:58:17,249 --> 01:58:20,286
I<i>'</i>m in trouble, right?

1091
01:58:25,649 --> 01:58:27,446
You really go for the trout.

1092
01:58:29,169 --> 01:58:31,478
I go for her, Fanny.

1093
01:58:32,769 --> 01:58:35,283
She<i>'</i>s got a good shape. What else?

1094
01:58:42,769 --> 01:58:44,919
To her I<i>'</i>m Nick.

1095
01:58:51,569 --> 01:58:53,207
Do you love her?

1096
01:58:54,769 --> 01:58:56,487
I don<i>'</i>t know.

1097
01:58:58,129 --> 01:59:00,484
I suppose so.

1098
01:59:01,569 --> 01:59:03,287
She loves me.

1099
01:59:09,009 --> 01:59:13,321
That<i>'</i>s it, then. If you love her...

1100
01:59:13,569 --> 01:59:15,799
...there<i>'</i>s nothing to discuss.

1101
01:59:16,049 --> 01:59:20,804
I<i>'</i>d make a clean exit, but my train
doesn<i>'</i>t leave for another hour.

1102
01:59:21,049 --> 01:59:24,724
I have to hang around here,
so you better check out.

1103
01:59:38,689 --> 01:59:40,486
See you in court, kid.

1104
01:59:52,889 --> 01:59:54,880
Good luck, Fanny.

1105
01:59:58,729 --> 02:00:00,481
Good luck, Billy.

1106
02:00:12,089 --> 02:00:15,877
Daddy, I know how we can settle
this whole thing right now.

1107
02:00:16,129 --> 02:00:19,007
- How?
- Let<i>'</i>s go take a sock at them.

1108
02:00:30,169 --> 02:00:34,048
<i>This was the 10th anniversary</i>
<i>of</i> The Baby Snooks Show...

1109
02:00:34,289 --> 02:00:36,484
<i>... from Hollywood, California.</i>

1110
02:00:44,569 --> 02:00:48,323
Hurry, I got company coming.
I gotta get home and change.

1111
02:01:22,089 --> 02:01:23,488
Hello, Fanny.

1112
02:01:27,529 --> 02:01:28,518
Hello, kid.

1113
02:01:33,369 --> 02:01:35,485
It<i>'</i>s been a long time, huh?

1114
02:01:40,609 --> 02:01:42,839
Sure has.

1115
02:01:49,009 --> 02:01:52,558
So, how do you think I look?

1116
02:01:55,609 --> 02:01:59,443
You look sensational.
You look great.

1117
02:02:00,329 --> 02:02:01,887
Thanks, kid.

1118
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:04,082
Why don<i>'</i>t you...?

1119
02:02:08,929 --> 02:02:10,885
How much did she take you for?

1120
02:02:11,569 --> 02:02:14,447
Oh, I can afford her.

1121
02:02:15,049 --> 02:02:18,883
Besides, the lady had
a legitimate beef.

1122
02:02:20,729 --> 02:02:23,163
- You don<i>'</i>t know your lines.
- What should I say?

1123
02:02:23,409 --> 02:02:26,685
Eleanor<i>'</i>s a bitch,
and you<i>'</i>ve never seen me like this.

1124
02:02:28,449 --> 02:02:32,488
- Seen you like what?
- Like I am, you jerk, perfect!

1125
02:02:33,489 --> 02:02:36,959
But I have.
I<i>'</i>ve seen you like that.

1126
02:02:37,929 --> 02:02:41,763
I mean, to me you always were perfect.

1127
02:02:45,009 --> 02:02:48,888
- So, what<i>'</i>ll you drink?
- Celery tonic.

1128
02:02:54,529 --> 02:02:57,646
- How<i>'</i>s Fran?
- Grown up.

1129
02:02:57,889 --> 02:03:00,801
Gorgeous. Married.

1130
02:03:01,769 --> 02:03:03,885
Thanks for asking, kid.

1131
02:03:05,529 --> 02:03:09,238
- You<i>'</i>re still good company, Billy.
- Yeah?

1132
02:03:17,369 --> 02:03:21,362
If I was such good company,
how come we were never alone?

1133
02:03:22,169 --> 02:03:26,082
Kid, we were four years married.
That<i>'</i>s not alone?

1134
02:03:43,529 --> 02:03:46,521
- Remember?
- Are you kidding? One of your best.

1135
02:04:00,529 --> 02:04:03,885
You know what I was thinking
about when I wrote that?

1136
02:04:08,889 --> 02:04:10,083
Nick?

1137
02:04:12,049 --> 02:04:14,005
That<i>'</i>s right, Nick.

1138
02:04:23,249 --> 02:04:25,285
Except you.

1139
02:04:25,809 --> 02:04:30,724
Nick, Adele, Bobby and me.

1140
02:04:48,889 --> 02:04:53,167
Being married to you was like
being married to a parade.

1141
02:04:55,889 --> 02:05:00,041
<i>"</i> Me and My Shadow.<i>"</i>
You used it in Cleveland.

1142
02:05:02,449 --> 02:05:05,122
Let<i>'</i>s not rehash Cleveland.

1143
02:05:06,369 --> 02:05:09,008
You still get high on celery tonic?

1144
02:05:09,249 --> 02:05:12,241
I took your advice.
I bought that company.

1145
02:05:12,489 --> 02:05:15,242
Now I make two cents while I enjoy.

1146
02:05:15,649 --> 02:05:17,924
Billy, I gotta hand it to you.

1147
02:05:18,169 --> 02:05:21,844
You got everything
you ever went out for.

1148
02:05:22,089 --> 02:05:23,681
But tell me something.

1149
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:29,079
You really have as much money
as they say?

1150
02:05:29,569 --> 02:05:32,129
All it takes to make a lot of money...

1151
02:05:33,369 --> 02:05:36,281
...is a lot of money.
But what to do with it.

1152
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:39,282
I don<i>'</i>t worry about you.
You<i>'</i>re resourceful.

1153
02:05:40,089 --> 02:05:41,681
You know, Fanny...

1154
02:05:50,129 --> 02:05:53,439
- I bought the Ziegfeld Theatre.
- Really?

1155
02:05:53,689 --> 02:05:58,046
The Ziegfeld<i>'</i>s mine. I<i>'</i>ll open up
with the biggest show ever.

1156
02:05:58,289 --> 02:06:01,645
Salvador Dali to do the sets.
Stokowski in the pit.

1157
02:06:01,889 --> 02:06:05,848
Music by Rodgers and Hammerstein.
Sketches by Kaufman and Hart.

1158
02:06:06,089 --> 02:06:08,762
Costumes from Paris,
the best of everything.

1159
02:06:09,009 --> 02:06:13,127
Real Alençon lace
on the chorus girls<i>'</i> drawers.

1160
02:06:13,369 --> 02:06:16,247
That sounds great, Billy.
Who<i>'</i>s gonna be in it?

1161
02:06:17,169 --> 02:06:20,320
Well, for openers, you.

1162
02:06:20,569 --> 02:06:24,482
Me? I knew you were on the hustle.

1163
02:06:24,809 --> 02:06:27,448
Look, you haven<i>'</i>t been
on a stage in years.

1164
02:06:27,689 --> 02:06:30,806
You<i>'</i>re sitting out here
doing that radio show.

1165
02:06:31,049 --> 02:06:35,998
You<i>'</i>re getting lazy. You<i>'</i>re a Ziegfeld
star, the star of stars.

1166
02:06:37,049 --> 02:06:39,802
Name your figure.
I give you whatever you want.

1167
02:06:40,889 --> 02:06:43,926
I make a good living.
I don<i>'</i>t need the money.

1168
02:06:45,049 --> 02:06:47,847
Maybe not, but you need me.

1169
02:06:48,089 --> 02:06:50,125
You? You I<i>'</i>ve had.

1170
02:06:53,369 --> 02:06:56,998
If you gotta get personal,
it won<i>'</i>t be complimentary.

1171
02:06:57,249 --> 02:06:59,717
Professionally, I only helped you.

1172
02:06:59,969 --> 02:07:03,439
In the work department,
I was good for you.

1173
02:07:04,849 --> 02:07:08,524
Come on,
let<i>'</i>s get together again, huh?

1174
02:07:11,129 --> 02:07:16,078
You know something, my timing
was always off for us. It<i>'</i>s too bad.

1175
02:07:16,329 --> 02:07:20,368
I just loused it all up.

1176
02:07:21,249 --> 02:07:23,683
You don<i>'</i>t get all the credit.

1177
02:07:26,209 --> 02:07:28,803
Look, <i>"</i> Billy Rose presents
Fanny Brice.<i>"</i>

1178
02:07:29,049 --> 02:07:31,882
I don<i>'</i>t like the Billy.
I<i>'</i>ll think it over.

1179
02:07:32,329 --> 02:07:35,799
You<i>'</i>ll think it over?
That<i>'</i>s what you say to me?

1180
02:07:36,049 --> 02:07:40,406
I haven<i>'</i>t done anything
without thinking in over 10 years.

1181
02:07:41,369 --> 02:07:43,325
You want to know the truth?

1182
02:07:43,889 --> 02:07:47,723
I was rattled as hell,
you coming here tonight.

1183
02:07:49,289 --> 02:07:53,646
I wanted for you to come in here
begging me to come back...

1184
02:07:53,889 --> 02:07:57,120
...so I could have the pleasure
of saying no.

1185
02:07:57,369 --> 02:08:01,487
Taken me a long time to say no.
I wanted to practise.

1186
02:08:02,329 --> 02:08:04,797
That<i>'</i>s what you<i>'</i>re saying to me? No?

1187
02:08:05,049 --> 02:08:08,325
I<i>'</i>m saying that I<i>'</i>ll think it over,
and I<i>'</i>ll call you.

1188
02:08:08,569 --> 02:08:11,402
- Think fast.
- I don<i>'</i>t wanna. That<i>'</i>s the point.

1189
02:08:11,649 --> 02:08:16,279
I<i>'</i>m at the Beverly Hills till
day after tomorrow. So, yes or no?

1190
02:08:16,529 --> 02:08:19,919
So I<i>'</i>ll call you before noon,
day after tomorrow.

1191
02:08:36,569 --> 02:08:38,639
Make it yes.

1192
02:08:38,889 --> 02:08:42,484
Rose and Brice.
Brice and Rose, whatever.

1193
02:08:43,489 --> 02:08:46,208
We could have a terrific time.

1194

02:09:08,169 --> 02:09:12,481
<i>Start the drumming</i>

1196
02:09:16,169 --> 02:09:20,287
<i>Sound the cymbal</i>

1197
02:09:22,849 --> 02:09:26,842

<i>Fill a thimble</i>

1199
02:09:36,049 --> 02:09:37,846
I need you.

1200
02:09:43,729 --> 02:09:46,926
<i>So come on, kids</i>

1201
02:09:47,169 --> 02:09:51,128
<i>Let's hear it for me</i>

1202
02:09:52,329 --> 02:09:55,082
<i>'Cause now I'm not afraid</i>

<i>Those butterflies are gone</i>

1204
02:09:58,329 --> 02:10:00,240
<i>My act is looking great</i>

1205

<i>Find your row, kid</i>

1209
02:10:14,489 --> 02:10:17,606
<i>We'll be strictly SRO, kid</i>

1210
02:10:17,849 --> 02:10:20,921
<i>And I'm glad to say</i>
<i>I'm finally free</i>

1211
02:10:21,169 --> 02:10:24,400
<i>Oh, your head feels so good</i>
<i>When you finally clear it</i>

1212
02:10:24,649 --> 02:10:27,447
<i>If I saw a worry</i>
<i>I wouldn't go near it</i>

1213
02:10:27,689 --> 02:10:29,759
<i>Come on, now</i>

1214
02:10:30,009 --> 02:10:35,037
<i>Let's hear it for me</i>
