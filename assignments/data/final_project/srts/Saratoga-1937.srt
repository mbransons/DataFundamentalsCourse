1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,513
That's the boy. Miracle Lad.

3
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:54,639
Go on!

4
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:56,261
Break his blasted neck.

5
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,898
You keep quiet or I'll
take a sock at you.

6
00:01:59,153 --> 00:01:59,799
Yeah?

7
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,865
Go ahead and I'll take a
sock at you right back.

8
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:16,949
There he goes. The last
stallion I've got on the place.

9
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:18,227
Hey.

10
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:22,072
How do you think I'm going to run
a breeding farm without a stud?

11
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:23,997
Huh? How am I?

12
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:26,736
That's your tough luck.
You can figure it out for yourself.

13
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:30,467
Hey, Limpy. Wait a minute.

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,367
Take that stallion back to the stable.

15
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,425
I've got an order from
the bank, Mr Bradley.

16
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:40,406
That half-witted son of mine
give him over to Ed Kenyon.

17
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,361
I'll come into the bank
and fix it with Mr Kenyon.

18
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:45,344
Alright, Mr Bradley. If you'll fix it.

19
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,419
Your darn tooting he'll fix it.

20
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:51,599
Go on. Take the horse back to the stable
the way I told you in the first place.

21
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:56,967
The idea. Trying to take
other people's horses.

22
00:02:58,397 --> 00:03:00,815
That confounded son of mine.

23
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:04,692
I wonder how he thinks I can run
a breeding farm without a stud.

24
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,094
Well, now that you bring it up it would
be quite a stunt wouldn't it, grandpa.

25
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:10,528
Selling off all the stock on the place.

26
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,843
Moonray will be the next
on the list, I suppose.

27
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,453
I'm surprised he
hasn't tried to sell me.

28
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,930
Has he had any offers?

29
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:21,115
Ah, but Duke. Think of it.

30
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:22,722
Brookvale.

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,004
When I was a young man, Brookvale
was the show place of all Saratoga.

32
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,272
When I first brought my bride
home from Niagara Falls.

33
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,839
It was all I could do to
get her into the house.

34
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:38,030
She was so crazy about the
champions in the stables.

35
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:41,088
You're kind of proud of
Brookvale, aren't you grandpa.

36
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,108
I was then.

37
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:43,340
Not now.

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,735
Say.

39
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:48,327
We got more dead horses
on this place than live ones.

40
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:49,851
Come here.

41
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:52,619
Look at that.

42
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,891
Every one of them champions.

43
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:58,980
There wasn't a line bred in
Kentucky could touch this stock.

44
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:03,313
We left those blue grass also-rans
on every stretch in America.

45
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,527
Why, they toasted Brookvale champions ..

46
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:07,748
And drank champagne
out of gold slippers.

47
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:12,284
At the old Haymarket way back
in my daddy's day in 1881.

48
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,496
There is Ebony Star, the greatest
two-year old of the nineties.

49
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,623
Pranced home at The Hopeful Stakes.

50
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,447
And her record has never been touched.

51
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:26,415
And then there is Blue Bold,
and the Flying Demon.

52
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:29,659
By Mad Power .. this one's grandpa.

53
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,344
And there is his daddy.

54
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:35,132
Dawn Boy.

55
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,794
The greatest stud in the
history of American racing.

56
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,968
I bred him, trained him
and buried him myself.

57
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:47,286
Grandpa, I forgot. Why is it Dawn Boy's
grave is out in front of the others?

58
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:51,301
Because Dawn Boy was always
out in front of the others.

59
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,770
And that is where he is going
to finish. Dead or alive.

60
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,662
Grandpa, I love you.

61
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:58,873
Mr Clayton.

62
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:00,549
Mr Clayton.

63
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,713
A telephone call over long
distance from London, England.

64
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,019
It's Miss Carol.

65
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,744
Ah, she don't want me.
She wants her daddy.

66
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:10,519
Tell her he's at the doctor.

67
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,775
I can't talk so far, Mr Clayton.

68
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,231
I gets too scared.

69
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,676
Oh go on, Duke. You talk to her.
- Alright.

70
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:19,458
I'm only her grandpa.
I can't talk to her.

71
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,636
She's got so high and mighty
since she's been in Europe ..

72
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,977
That she won't talk to nobody but Kings.

73
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,264
She's got her daddy worried.

74
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:29,965
She moves around all the time
and don't leave no address.

75
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,978
Yeah, I know. That brat
needs a good spanking.

76
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,030
She don't mean nothing, Mr Duke.

77
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,479
That's just her way.

78
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,261
Rosetta. I love you.

79
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:42,662
Hello?

80
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:44,825
Hello?

81
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,313
Hello? Hello, daddy.

82
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:48,657
Daddy, this is Carol.

83
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,530
Get ready for a big surprise.

84
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:52,235
I'm going to be married.

85
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,324
That's alright with me but don't bring
anything home to frighten your dad.

86
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:56,951
Who is this?

87
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:58,460
My name is Duke Bradley.

88
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:01,190
A friend of your father's.
Why don't you try it sometime?

89
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,804
Put my father on the phone.
- Who is it?

90
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:06,576
It's some fool.

91
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:10,225
I would like to speak with my father.

92
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:11,516
He isn't here.

93
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:12,936
Where can he get you?

94
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,302
I'm at Northborough House.

95
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,699
What's the address?

96
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,689
Northborough House is the county
seat of the Duke of Northborough.

97
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:21,487
Say, you'd better take that crown
off your head and come home.

98
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,049
What's that?

99
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:24,872
Who do you think you're talking to?

100
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,118
Who is it, darling?

101
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:30,086
Will you please tell me where my
father is that I may call him there?

102
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:31,584
Well, if you must know.

103
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,393
He's down at the doctor's. He's
having a little trouble with his heart.

104
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,429
Heart?

105
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,164
Is .. is it serious?

106
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:39,131
Well, he'd be better off without it.

107
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:41,914
Tell father I'll take
the next boat home.

108
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:45,310
Now you're talking, honey. Even if you
must bring that foreign monkey with you.

109
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,423
What did he say?
- Nothing. I ..

110
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:51,749
And please tell my father that I'm
marrying a perfectly good American.

111
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,281
Hartley Madison of New York.

112
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,196
Who did you say?

113
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:56,912
Hartley Madison.

114
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,286
Well, nice going, honey.
You certainly hooked a big one.

115
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:03,675
Bring him home.
I want to give him a kiss.

116
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,576
Hey, wait a minute.
Here comes your father now.

117
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:07,759
Hello?

118
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:08,866
Hello?

119
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,121
Hello!

120
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:11,963
She hung up on me.

121
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,415
That's Miss Carol alright. Chock full
of temper ever since she was born.

122
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,587
Hello, Frank. I've just
talked to your daughter.

123
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,658
Carol? How is she, Duke?
- Get yourself set for some great news.

124
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,529
That little lady has hooked
herself a very wealthy chump.

125
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,053
Hooked?
- Getting married.

126
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:26,417
No.
- To Hartley Madison.

127
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:27,912
You don't say.

128
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,210
Not that rich New York fellah?
- Nobody else.

129
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:32,211
A sucker in the family.

130
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,161
Now we'll go places.

131
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,904
We'll have a real breeding farm again.

132
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:42,034
Hundreds of brood mares
and bloodied stallions.

133
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:45,724
We'll put Brookvale back
on the map, where it belongs.

134
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:46,847
My, my.

135
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:48,161
You said it, Rosetta.

136
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:50,310
Just a minute.
Do you fellows call him a sucker?

137
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:51,160
Sure.

138
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,103
Well, who was it I heard took you
for $50,000 once at Belmont?

139
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,392
Hartley Madison.

140
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,190
I thought so. And he's the sucker, eh?

141
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,309
Madison just happened to
quit when he was ahead.

142
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:01,759
His old man died I think and he
had to take over the business.

143
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,621
But if I can only get him back again.

144
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,720
Hot dog. I'll help you, Duke.

145
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,582
I'll make Carol bring him round.

146
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:08,981
Grandpa, you're a pal.

147
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,527
Duke, are you crazy?
- Why?

148
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:13,412
Why, a big player like Hartley
Madison could wind you up.

149
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:16,768
You or any other bookmaker.
He has a bankroll like the US Treasury.

150
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:20,201
Frank, ever since the depression I've
been making book for piker bettors.

151
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:23,332
Fifty dollars, a hundred dollars.
A thousand dollars, tops.

152
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,848
But happy days are here again.

153
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:28,346
Your little girl is bringing home
the biggest bettor of all.

154
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,524
Well, all I can say is you've
got plenty of nerve.

155
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:31,793
Frank, I love you.

156
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,796
What did the croaker say, Frank?

157
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,817
Did Kenyon send over
yet for Miracle Lad?

158
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:40,143
Heck yes, and the Duke here
wouldn't let him have him.

159
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,500
Wouldn't let him?

160
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,995
He's going to fix it up with Ed Kenyon.
- No, he's not.

161
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,335
Now Frank, this is a matter
between grandpa and me.

162
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:48,508
Now, there will be no argument.
I won't have it.

163
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:50,595
Now dad, you take that
horse over to Kenyon.

164
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:53,576
Say, what kind of a son are you, anyhow?

165
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:58,188
I wish you could figure out how to
run a breeding farm without a stud.

166
00:08:58,484 --> 00:08:59,329
I can't.

167
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:02,799
I'm going out behind
the barn to get drunk.

168
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,297
Frank.

169
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,033
I wish you'd let grandpa keep his stud.

170
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:11,685
No. Thanks a lot, but I owe
you too much already.

171
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,668
Say, that reminds me.

172
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,699
Come in the other room now, will you.

173
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:18,042
You know, Duke.

174
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:19,883
Carol must really like Madison.

175
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:23,638
It can't be his money because
nobody knows I'm broke but you.

176
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:25,976
What about the croaker, Frank?

177
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:28,925
Well, he scared me a little and
says I really got a bum heart.

178
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,234
There is nothing wrong with me
that a winning bet won't cure.

179
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:36,537
There wouldn't be a thing wrong with you
at all if you cut out this fool betting.

180
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:39,050
Get wise to yourself, Frank.
You can't beat us bookmakers.

181
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,250
The old law of averages will flatten
out the biggest bankroll in the country.

182
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,961
Well, anyway. My bankroll can't
take it. This is my last season.

183
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,411
Now that Carol is going to be taken
care of, I want you to have this.

184
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,441
What is it?
- Deeds of the farm.

185
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,450
Security for the sixty
grand I've lost to you.

186
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,151
Are you nuts?
- Please to take it.

187
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:55,892
Your friendship means a lot to me.

188
00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:58,926
You've only known me a bit over a year.
- I don't care if it's only for a week.

189
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:01,682
We're pals and you want to give
me a mark. Put that thing away.

190
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,715
Thanks, Duke. But that's
the way it has to be.

191
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,694
Please shut up and behave.
- I mean it, Duke.

192
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,350
I won't take that and you know it.
- Now, I'm not going to argue.

193
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:09,533
Now listen here.

194
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:12,161
The croaker told me not to start
hollering at anybody. Here, take it.

195
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:17,796
Alright.
- Thanks.

196
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:20,813
If that's the way you want it.

197
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,277
A funny thing. After all the
big heart specialists I've seen.

198
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,242
Nothing seems to regulate the old ticker
as well as plain bicarbonate of soda.

199
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:29,950
That's right.

200
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,938
Golly Duke, I'm glad the kid is
getting away from racetracks.

201
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,943
You know, I've always wanted her to be
something more than a dressed-up gypsy.

202
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,002
Here's to you, kid.

203
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,532
50 dollars across on Jay Bloom.

204
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,971
550 to win, 250 to place and
a 150 to show on number 748.

205
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:02,390
Hi, Duke. She finally got here.

206
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:04,261
Hello, grandpa. Who got here?
- Carol.

207
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:05,409
10-1 on Rester.

208
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:08,698
Yes sir. 60-10 to win on
Rester, number 738.

209
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,054
Where is Madison? Is he with her?
- Sure he is.

210
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,434
Take a gander.

211
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,950
Oh .. so that's Frank's kid, huh?

212
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,421
Well, the sucker is certainly
getting his money's worth.

213
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:25,443
Yeah, but she's got so
all-fired high and mighty ..

214
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,651
You can't understand a word she says.

215
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,686
Rusty Gate, 20 to place.

216
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:32,666
Yes, sir. Rusty Gate.
40-20 to place. Number 410.

217
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:33,915
Here Tip, take charge.

218
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,437
Come on, grandpa. Front for me.

219
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,262
10 across on Light Fantasy.

220
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:40,409
Light Fantasy. 60-10. 25-10. 12-10.

221
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,064
Number 526.
- Right.

222
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:43,321
Hello Frank.
- Duke.

223
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,142
Hello, Mr Madison.
Good to see you again.

224
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:46,119
How are you?

225
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,473
You remember him: Duke Bradley.

226
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:51,409
I haven't forgotten what you
did to me at Belmont once.

227
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,474
Oh, of course. Now, I remember.

228
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,979
Well, I won some money
from you, didn't I?

229
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:58,723
<i>Some</i> money is right.

230
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:01,076
Duke, this is Carol.
- How do you do.

231
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,111
Charmed, I'm sure.
- What did I tell you.

232
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:06,867
I doubt you remember me, Miss Clayton.
- I'm afraid I don't.

233
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:09,066
I talked to you on the phone
that day. Duke Bradley?

234
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,077
I think you were in some Count's place.

235
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,903
Oh. Oh, quite.

236
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,465
Congratulations on your engagement.
You certainly picked a winner.

237
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:19,308
You know, it's good to see a big
bettor back on the track, Mr Madison.

238
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:21,167
Thanks. But I'm only
a spectator nowadays.

239
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,602
The horses are at the gate.

240
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,816
Well, the track isn't much
fun if you don't bet.

241
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:28,160
If you're looking for a future customer,
you're wasting your time, Mr Bradley.

242
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:30,360
We have no intention of
being around the track.

243
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,311
Not really?

244
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,337
We're only here today because of father.

245
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,448
Just slumming, huh?

246
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:37,482
Rather comfortable slumming, Mr Clayton.

247
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:38,987
Hello, Duke.

248
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,760
Hello, Fritzi.

249
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,999
Why honey, you look as sharp as a razor.

250
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,362
Why not? I'm married.
- No.

251
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,122
Who's the sucker?
- Harriet Hale.

252
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:48,862
Who?

253
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,418
Harriet Hale.
The big coldcream and skin man.

254
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:53,727
His real name is Kiffmeyer.
- Oh.

255
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,665
Plenty of dough, huh?

256
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:59,477
All the government allows.
- Honey, I love you.

257
00:13:00,142 --> 00:13:02,530
Fritzi, please meet Miss Clayton.
- Oh. I'm pleased to know you.

258
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,609
How do you do.

259
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,942
And how are you, Mr Clayton?
- Well ..

260
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:10,146
My ticker has been missing for
forty years and I'm alright.

261
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,386
I think he's got a horse doctor.

262
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:25,511
What have you bet on, daddy?
- I have a big bet on Jay Blue.

263
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:27,064
Come on, Jay Blue.

264
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:32,475
Daddy? What is it, daddy?

265
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:34,953
Hartley, Hartley.
- Take it easy.

266
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,625
Look honey, will you
fetch my bicarbonate.

267
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:38,734
Of course, dad.

268
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:45,805
Fix me a bicarbonate of soda, please.

269
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,846
Sure. How are you, Miss Clayton?
- Fine, thanks.

270
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,543
Don't worry, dear. He'll be alright.

271
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,553
He's gotten so grey and feeble, Hartley.
- When did you get back, Miss Clayton?

272
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:53,756
Just the other day.

273
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,405
You look mighty pretty.
- Thanks.

274
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:56,838
Is it for your dad?
- Yes.

275
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,433
Thought so. Getting to be quite a habit.
- Thank you.

276
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:00,920
Keep it.
- Thank you.

277
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:04,668
What is it?

278
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:06,296
Well, what is it?

279
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:15,369
Oh, Hartley.

280
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,782
Hello?

281
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:37,310
Who?

282
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,079
Mr Bradley?

283
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,589
Who wants him?

284
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,073
Just a minute.

285
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:44,741
Hey, it's Frank Clayton's girl.

286
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:45,728
What?

287
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:47,249
Back in Saratoga?

288
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,206
That means the sucker must be with her.

289
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,014
Good morning, Carol.

290
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:53,537
How are you?

291
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:57,266
I'm downstairs in the bank, Mr Bradley.
Would you be kind enough to come down?

292
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:58,427
"<i>At the bank?</i>"

293
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:00,492
Look Carol, couldn't I meet
you somewhere else?

294
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:01,885
"<i>Banks do something to me</i>."

295
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:04,925
I'll only detain you a few minutes.
I'm in Mr Kenyon's office.

296
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:05,903
"<i>Kenyon?</i>"

297
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,604
That's the granite-faced old buzzard
who took grandpa's Miracle Lad.

298
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:11,978
"<i>He never smiles. When he was born, they
had to open his mouth with a chisel</i>."

299
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:14,650
"<i>I couldn't talk to Kenyon.
He'd dry me up like a dust storm</i>."

300
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,314
Well, you come down here please.
I'm in a hurry.

301
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,886
Well, look Carol.
I haven't had any breakfast yet.

302
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:21,923
Couldn't you bring Mr Madison up here?

303
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:25,721
Hello .. hello.

304
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,932
It's getting to be a habit
of hers, hanging up on me.

305
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:33,031
I never knew a banker to
lay a decent bet in my life.

306
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,671
You know, it must be something about the
market that Frank made me take the farm.

307
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,955
Hey, I must dig that
up and give it to her.

308
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:41,244
Give it to her?
- Would you have me keep it?

309
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:45,247
She don't need the farm. She'll own half
of New York when she marries that chump.

310
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,201
Yeah. But grandpa won't.

311
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,199
I guess you've blown your topper.

312
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:51,169
Tippy, I love you.

313
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,552
Good morning, Mr Bradley.
- Good morning, Ernest.

314
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:57,292
No-one can ever tell me Hartley
Madison is through with racing.

315
00:15:57,412 --> 00:16:00,871
Why, I can see him now putting
down 10, 20, even 50 Gs at a clip.

316
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:02,114
Sure sounds sweet.

317
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:03,882
Come in.

318
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:08,459
Good morning, Carol.

319
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,589
Good morning.
- Well, come in honey.

320
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:11,688
Thank you.

321
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:14,949
Isn't Mr Madison with you?
- No, he isn't.

322
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:16,349
Where is he?
- Newport.

323
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:17,435
Newport?
- Yes.

324
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:19,697
Not to stay?
- We're marrying there next month.

325
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:21,144
Oh.

326
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:23,630
Then he won't be coming back here?
- No.

327
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:25,787
And as I told you before ..

328
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:29,202
If you are planning on Mr Madison as a
victim you might as well give it all up.

329
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,249
Well, you can't blame
me for being ambitious.

330
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:36,894
Will you have some breakfast?
- I will not.

331
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,549
No? Well, would you mind
sitting down while I have mine?

332
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,925
I came up here to learn what you
intend to do with my father's farm.

333
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:44,662
Do with it?
- I ..

334
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:49,034
I hope you won't dispose of it without
at least giving me a chance to buy it.

335
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:53,169
Oh .. I see.

336
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,793
I assure you I dislike
asking favors of you.

337
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:58,454
But my grandfather doesn't know
you hold a deed to his property.

338
00:16:58,574 --> 00:16:59,417
I know that.

339
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:02,055
Well, it would be a kindness if
you don't let him know the truth ..

340
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,961
Until I can have Mr Madison pay you off.

341
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:08,781
Is that all, before I
reach for a hairbrush?

342
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,930
I don't know how to parry
wisecracks with you.

343
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:12,950
I fear I have been away
from America too long.

344
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,571
I'll say you've been away too long.

345
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:15,905
Sit down.

346
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:18,786
I see coming here was a mistake. I'll
leave things in the hands of the bank.

347
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:19,849
Just a moment.

348
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:21,525
Come in.

349
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,220
Hello Duke. Oh, hello Carol.

350
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,469
How do you do.

351
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,919
Hello baby.

352
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:28,983
Honey, are we off to look at horses?

353
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:32,009
Fritzi, I must have a talk with Carol.
Do you mind if we postpone our trip?

354
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,174
Why, of course not.
I'll see you at the track, Dukey.

355
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:35,423
Fritzi, I love you.

356
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:36,887
Goodbye, Carol.
- Goodbye.

357
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:42,399
So you think I'm going to
foreclose the mortgage, eh?

358
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,793
Now I'm going to tell
you what I think of you.

359
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,887
I'm not interested in
what you think of me.

360
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,972
I'll not have the frost put on me by
a fellah you roped out of Saratoga ..

361
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,721
With clover on her heels and finished
up with a bad case of swellhead.

362
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:55,158
It's taken mean old men
working in banks all their lives ..

363
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:57,189
To figure out notions you
just fastened on me.

364
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,317
Me, Duke Bradley. One of
the boys. Father's friend.

365
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:01,908
Just a moment. My father could
have lost to other bookmakers.

366
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:04,795
It seems to me his friendship
paid you mighty well.

367
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:08,649
I'll answer that crack by assuring you
no matter what other bookmakers do ..

368
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,357
I'm not going to oust grandpa
because I love the old pest.

369
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:14,638
You can stop worrying about the
farm and start springing the trap ..

370
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,205
When the sucker is bankrolled.

371
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:18,961
For your information, I'm marrying
Hartley Madison because I love him.

372
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:21,985
This is Duke. You can level with me.
- I don't know what you talk about.

373
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,071
Don't pretend that Frank's daughter
has fallen for a Wall Street chump.

374
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:26,422
A Wall Street chump?

375
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:29,116
Where would you people be if it
weren't for the word 'chump'?

376
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:30,537
To you it wins any argument.

377
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:33,103
If you call someone a chump,
then it proves you're his superior.

378
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:35,318
You, a fly-by-night bookmaker ..

379
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:38,432
Calling a member of one of the most
important families in American a chump.

380
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:42,419
A man who could buy and sell 20 petty
gamblers like you with his small change.

381
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,657
I suppose you'd marry him
if he didn't have a quarter?

382
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:47,098
I'd prefer him that way.
Now open that door.

383
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:49,753
Alright.

384
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:52,849
I guess you'd better go ahead and marry
the sucker and let him pay me off.

385
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,740
That's exactly what I intend to do.

386
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,260
You'd better quit kidding yourself
about being in love, babe.

387
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,422
You know from where I sit a gal
that puts the bite on a bridegroom ..

388
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:03,198
For sixty thousand smackers before
she even gets him to the altar.

389
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:05,699
Is awfully full of larceny.
- What ..?

390
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:08,334
Will you open that door?

391
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:09,743
Sure.

392
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,135
Honey, you're strutting like a pacer.

393
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:30,187
This bay filly before you
is lot 45 'Dubonnet'.

394
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:31,967
Thoroughbred and registered.

395
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,584
Her sire is Giva.

396
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,856
One hundred and fifteen
thousand dollars.

397
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:38,240
Duke.

398
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,694
I'm the most unhappy
person in the world.

399
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:42,304
What's the matter?
- Dubonnet.

400
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:45,227
The yearling I wanted to buy ever since
he was born and my husband isn't here.

401
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,632
I got him clear up to the gate
but he wouldn't come in.

402
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,117
What's the matter? No time?

403
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,803
No. He doesn't like horses.
They make him sneeze.

404
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:55,523
Did you say 'sneeze'?
- Yes, sneeze. Hay fever.

405
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:58,699
Oh there he is, the sweetheart.

406
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,983
Who, your husband?
- No, that colt.

407
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,288
Twenty-five hundred.

408
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,455
25 hundred.
The gentleman starts right up.

409
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:06,856
25 hundred. Do I hear 35? Do I hear 35?

410
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:08,310
Oh, there they go.

411
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,047
Now don't you worry, honey.

412
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,550
Just lead me to Mr Kiffmeyer.

413
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,942
And I'll explain to him that
Dubonnet is sneeze-less.

414
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,259
No, no. Not the two of us together.
- Why not?

415
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:20,462
He's jealous. He thinks I'm Cleopatra
and every man is in love with me.

416
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,352
Well, who says he's wrong?

417
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,642
Oh, darling. I'd like you to
meet an old friend of mine.

418
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:28,134
Mr Bradley.
- How do you do.

419
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:30,611
How .. how old?
- Oh, darling.

420
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:33,272
There is the horse I was talking about.
There is Dubonnet. Look.

421
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:37,220
Don't try to change the
subject. I said how old?

422
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,754
Since I was in the chorus.
Oh, there he goes.

423
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:41,587
Well, let him .. go.

424
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,795
Look Mr Kiffmeyer.

425
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:45,822
A horse would keep Fritzi from being
lonely while you're away on business.

426
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:46,669
What?

427
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:49,481
Yes. And besides, he'd be good
publicity for your cold cream.

428
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,782
Well, my horses don't
need any cold cream.

429
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:54,658
I mean cold cream doesn't need any ..
- We know what you mean, dear.

430
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,258
Well, you know I can't be around horses.

431
00:20:57,378 --> 00:20:59,578
And how do I know what you
will be doing around horses?

432
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:02,510
While I can't be around .. horses.

433
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,406
Why, Mr K. Do you mean that?

434
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:06,778
Well, I .. I .. why?

435
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:10,595
Fifty-five. Fifty-five hundred is bid.
Now then, do I hear six? Do I hear six?

436
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,127
Six thousand is bid. Thank you, sir.

437
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:16,438
Whose bid was that, please?

438
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:18,109
Whose bid was that, please?

439
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:24,449
Thank you, sir. Six thousand is bid.
Now then, do I hear six-five?

440
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:27,575
Gesundheit.

441
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:29,510
Well, you needn't bother.

442
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,612
Sold for six thousand.

443
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:33,310
What is the name please?

444
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:35,592
Mr Jessie Kiffmeyer of New York.

445
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,221
Here, what are you doing?

446
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,564
Sold to Mr Jessie Kiffmeyer of New York.

447
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:41,907
Good work, Mr K.

448
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:43,393
You can't .. we can't ..

449
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:48,030
Boys, how long will to take
a picture of Mr Kiffmeyer?

450
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,789
Why?

451
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:49,797
Never mind.

452
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,118
But I'm all out of plates.
- That's alright.

453
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,424
There he is, boys.
The new owner of Dubonnet.

454
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,794
You can't bamboozle me into this.
- Fix his tie, Fritzi.

455
00:21:57,914 --> 00:22:00,051
Let me make you pretty, honey.
- I won't buy that horse.

456
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:03,635
Kiffmeyer is his name but he's enthroned
by 50 million women as 'Harriet Hale'.

457
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:06,245
Is that who she is?
- The greatest cosmetician in the world.

458
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,345
Well, 'beautician' is
the more modern term.

459
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:11,801
Hold up your head, Mr Hale.
- Miss Hale.

460
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:13,563
Well, 'Kiffmeyer' will do.

461
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,363
I beg your pardon, Mr Kiffmeyer.
- Yes?

462
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:17,459
Please make arrangements
with the cashier.

463
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:18,440
I'm not ..

464
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,370
Stay here Kiffy at a good sneezing
distance while I go settle for Dubonnet.

465
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,106
I'll go help you.
- No, wait a minute.

466
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,994
I'll take care of your wife.
I mean you take care of ..

467
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:28,429
Hi, Duke.

468
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,215
Hello, grandpa.

469
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:33,257
I wish you'd talk to that girl.
I can't do a thing with her.

470
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:34,547
What girl?
- Carol.

471
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,942
Carol? She's in Newport.
- Newport, nothing.

472
00:22:37,393 --> 00:22:40,360
She's right over there getting
ready to sell Moonray.

473
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,487
The last yearling I've got on the place.

474
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:44,480
Don't worry now. I'll go
and see what I can do.

475
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:48,358
Good evening, Carol.
- Well, good evening.

476
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:50,025
So you didn't go to Newport, huh?

477
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:51,594
No, I'm at Coney Island.

478
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,899
Why Carol, that almost
sounded like a crack.

479
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,336
You think you ought
to sell grandpa's colt?

480
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:58,017
I've found I must have some money.

481
00:22:58,241 --> 00:22:58,913
Money?

482
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:01,947
I'll pay you off before my marriage.
- Pay me off?

483
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,455
Not because of that crack I made
about you clipping Madison?

484
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:07,253
That had nothing to do with it.
I thought things over. That's all.

485
00:23:07,828 --> 00:23:10,724
Well, I think you're an awful sucker.
If I had a come-on I'd marry him myself.

486
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:13,561
Besides, this yearling won't bring you
more than a few thousand dollars.

487
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:15,263
I can run it up to what I owe you.

488
00:23:15,447 --> 00:23:17,118
Run it up? On your stocking?
- Bet it.

489
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:19,240
You can't beat the law
of averages, Carol.

490
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,146
No?
- No.

491
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:22,976
Even though you know the track and
know all about handicapping horses.

492
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:24,477
That's your opinion.

493
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,441
What does Mr Madison think about
you postponing his wedding?

494
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,979
Mr Madison recognises that
there is such a thing as integrity.

495
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:32,732
Oh, I see.

496
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,945
Say Carol, if you're ready to sell
that horse, they're waiting for you.

497
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,262
Evening, Miss Clayton.
- Good evening.

498
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,320
Good evening.

499
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:46,496
Alright, Miss Clayton.

500
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:49,643
Ladies and gentlemen,
this yearling colt is Moonray.

501
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:53,621
He was bred at the Brookvale farm
and is by our famous sire Dawn Boy.

502
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,001
His dam is that great race
mare .. Planet Girl.

503
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,926
He has been handled and
broken since the first of the year.

504
00:24:00,324 --> 00:24:02,879
He has a grand disposition
and with his royal breeding ..

505
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,558
In a capable trainer's hands should
develop into a great racehorse.

506
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:06,705
Thank you.

507
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,373
You heard what Miss Clayton
has said about this colt.

508
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:11,395
Now what is your pleasure,
ladies and gentlemen?

509
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:13,075
One thousand dollars.

510
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:15,892
A thousand dollars.
Do I hear two? Do I hear two?

511
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:19,252
Ha. A thousand dollars?
His tail is worth more than that.

512
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:20,391
Be still, grandpa.

513
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:24,699
What did I ever do to have such
a grandchild? A thousand dollars.

514
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:25,837
Cripes.

515
00:24:27,037 --> 00:24:28,167
Five thousand dollars.

516
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,783
Five thousand is bid.

517
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:31,075
Thank you. Five. Five.

518
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:33,631
Well, as I live and breathe
it is Hartley Madison.

519
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:37,187
And he went for five
grand the first clip.

520
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:39,425
What a beautiful sucker.

521
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:42,549
Here's where you get your stake, honey.
- But I don't want ..

522
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:44,445
Look out, Mr Madison.
I'm coming into this.

523
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:46,481
Go ahead old boy.
- Fifty-five hundred.

524
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:47,613
Six thousand.

525
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:48,617
Sixty-five.

526
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,664
What are you doing?
Bookmakers can't own horses.

527
00:24:51,308 --> 00:24:53,147
I'm going to run the
stake in for you, honey.

528
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:55,394
Seventy-five.
- Good for you.

529
00:24:55,656 --> 00:24:56,328
Eight.

530
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,942
Say, you're going rather
high on the colt aren't you?

531
00:24:59,062 --> 00:24:59,946
Think so?

532
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:01,672
Eighty-five.
- Stop it, will you.

533
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:03,321
Oh, let him alone.

534
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:04,237
Nine.

535
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,099
Nine thousand is bid.

536
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:07,403
Ninety-five.

537
00:25:07,824 --> 00:25:09,172
Ten thousand dollars.

538
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,628
I don't want him to be stung
for more than fifteen thousand.

539
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,572
Oh you're crazy. He'll go for twenty.

540
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:15,631
Ten-five.

541
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:17,507
Don't go over fifteen Duke, please.

542
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,521
Eleven.

543
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:20,941
Eleven-five.

544
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:22,641
I must just say hello to Hartley.

545
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,713
Eleven-five the gentleman bids.
Do you make it twelve?

546
00:25:25,968 --> 00:25:27,404
That colt isn't worth that much.

547
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:28,482
Twelve thousand.

548
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,293
Hello, sweet.
- Hello, darling.

549
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:32,391
Twelve-five.

550
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:34,182
Let him have him at fourteen-five.

551
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:36,155
But why dear? Thirteen.

552
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:40,893
I see larceny in your
granddaughter's kisser.

553
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:42,472
You do?

554
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:43,897
Please do as I say.

555
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:46,738
Darling, I'd like to own Moonray.
- Won't you do this for me?

556
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,315
Of course I'll do this for you.

557
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:51,990
Fourteen thousand.
- Now let him have him.

558
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:54,367
Fourteen-five.

559
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:57,058
Mr Madison, you've bought a horse.

560
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:58,483
Swell.
- But ..

561
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:01,799
But what, dear?
- Don't you see that he was trying ..

562
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:03,790
Don't you want me to have Moonray?

563
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,715
Well, of course I do, but ..

564
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:08,363
Well, Mr Madison. That was a lot of fun.
- Hey, wasn't it.

565
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:11,338
Why did you quit? You know,
Carol wanted you to have Moonray.

566
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,511
She did?
- Yeah.

567
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:14,093
Now, wasn't that sweet of her.

568
00:26:14,562 --> 00:26:17,548
Mr Madison, what are you going to
do with that yearling of mine?

569
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,553
I know you didn't buy him for yourself.

570
00:26:19,673 --> 00:26:21,295
How are you, Mr Clayton?
- Alright.

571
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:24,637
What are you going to do with him?
I got a birthday coming up this month.

572
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:26,041
Grandpa.
- Oh shut up.

573
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,991
If you want him well trained,
nobody can do it better than grandpa.

574
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:33,319
That's an idea. Would you keep Moonray
on at Brookvale and train him for me?

575
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:35,070
Of course he won't.
- Why not?

576
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:37,346
Darling, he would be doing
me a favor. Will you?

577
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:41,855
Oh here I am ending up as nursemaid
to a yearling I don't own.

578
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:43,696
And I ain't even got a stud.

579
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:45,787
I sure could use one.

580
00:26:48,158 --> 00:26:50,636
Mr Madison. Think you'll do any
betting while you're down this time?

581
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:51,907
I don't know. Perhaps.

582
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,445
Mr Madison, will you make arrangements
with the cashier, please.

583
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,646
Oh yes, of course.

584
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:58,143
Duke, look after Carol for me, will you.
- With pleasure.

585
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,213
You leave him alone.

586
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,760
Carol, if a man wants to make
a few little bets, why can't I ..

587
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,730
I told you Mr Madison wasn't betting.
Now leave him alone.

588
00:27:06,954 --> 00:27:08,319
You know, you're kind of cute.

589
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:10,316
Do you want to take my
bets by any chance?

590
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,928
Carol, if you only bring a man
around the track once in a while ..

591
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,692
Do you want to take my bet?
- Oh sure.

592
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:15,616
Alright.

593
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:38,468
Weight a hundred and ten pounds.

594
00:27:38,813 --> 00:27:39,902
[ Laughter ]

595
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:42,930
I guess that's Miss Fritzi. I guess
Mr Duke told her something funny.

596
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:44,322
Will you be still.

597
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,651
Look here, honey. You is going to have
a nervous breakup working so hard.

598
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:49,697
Belmont, Aqueduct and Maryland.

599
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:52,335
You ain't had a day's rest
since we left Saratoga.

600
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:54,408
He's carrying a hundred
and fifteen pounds.

601
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:56,668
That means he's picking up five.

602
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:59,256
[ Laughter ]

603
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,204
Will you tell Mr Bradley
I'd like to see him.

604
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:03,956
I sure will.

605
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,433
You got a pencil smudge
on your chin, honey.

606
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:08,589
What of it?

607
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,671
Don't you want to look
pretty for Mr Bradley?

608
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:11,796
Why should I?

609
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:13,937
I would fix up for him anytime.

610
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,055
If he was only the right
color, I'd marry him.

611
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,520
[ Buzzer ]

612
00:28:37,937 --> 00:28:38,777
Come in.

613
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:42,514
Good evening, Carol. I didn't
know you were on this train.

614
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:45,254
How long will those friends
of yours keep up that racket?

615
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:47,980
Surely honey, you haven't forgot
how the mob acts on a racing special.

616
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,351
We're likely to whoop it up all night.
Why not join us and have a little fun?

617
00:28:51,602 --> 00:28:53,853
I'm afraid I've gotten away
from that idea of 'fun'.

618
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,100
Oh .. oh, I see.

619
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:01,308
How are they coming?
- I can't complain.

620
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:02,657
No, I should think not.

621
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,399
Do you realize you've nicked my books
for thirty-seven hundred dollars?

622
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:07,277
Thirty-seven fifty.
- No.

623
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,750
Why, if this luck of yours
keeps up, I'll cut my throat.

624
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,890
Oh, it's luck, is it?
- What do you call it?

625
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,794
I'm afraid I call it hard work.

626
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:20,044
Say honey. If it's noisy here you can
change with me and take my compartment.

627
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:21,174
No. No thank you.

628
00:29:21,294 --> 00:29:23,214
No trouble. I'll move the stuff.
- I prefer not.

629
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:25,444
Rosetta. Tell the porter
to switch our bags.

630
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,471
I sure will.

631
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:28,724
If there's a crap game there,
tell the boys to get out.

632
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:30,471
I will.
- And don't get in the game.

633
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:32,073
You go on, Mr Duke.

634
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,573
Is this everything?
- Yes.

635
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:35,229
Excuse me.

636
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:39,369
Hello, Miss Clayton.
- Hello, Clipper.

637
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:42,611
Look folks, we've got an
Frank's daughter. Good for you.

638
00:29:43,677 --> 00:29:44,432
Thanks.

639
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:46,643
Hello, honey.

640
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:48,125
Good evening, Mrs Kiffmeyer.

641
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,592
Hello Fritzi.
- Hello, Duke.

642
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:51,677
Hello Miss Clayton.
- Hello.

643
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,309
You remember 'handwriting Hurley'?
- Oh. How are you?

644
00:29:54,783 --> 00:29:56,924
Gee, Miss Clayton. It's good to see you.
- Thanks.

645
00:29:57,294 --> 00:30:00,671
I've been thinking about you a
lot since .. since your dad went.

646
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:02,703
He thought a lot of you, too.

647
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,416
Hurley. I bet she doesn't
remember this one.

648
00:30:06,244 --> 00:30:07,686
Hello Miss Clayton.

649
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:10,480
Why that's the baby. Little Katy.

650
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:12,538
It's little Katy, but it's not the baby.

651
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:15,066
Come here .. oh, Pearl.

652
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:16,934
Hello, Miss Clayton.

653
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:18,349
Here is the final edition.

654
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:19,944
Pearl, how you do things.

655
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:22,929
Oh you angel. May I take one.
- Of course.

656
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:26,551
Oh Miss Clayton, you've
come back home again.

657
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:29,213
Teddy, look out. Duke, take the baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

658
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,086
Katy, you're going to smother me, honey.

659
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,867
Katy, will you be careful and
come here and sit down.

660
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,584
Hey, take this guy will you.

661
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:37,815
No, Duke. Okay. You're out in front.
- Well, here ..

662
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,221
Here, take this sucker
before I break him.

663
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,391
No. You can keep him.
I've got another one here.

664
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:43,748
But I didn't want him.

665
00:30:48,143 --> 00:30:49,856
Say, I'm doing alright with this guy.

666
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:52,039
Say, Duke. I must hit you
for five bucks. You too.

667
00:30:52,214 --> 00:30:54,308
What for?
- Duggan lost his job.

668
00:30:54,578 --> 00:30:55,851
Kick in the green, fellahs.

669
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:58,457
I'd like to get in on that too, sweet.
- That's swell. Thanks.

670
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,507
Add it for me please.
- Okay.

671
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,385
Come on fellahs, let's see the green.

672
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:07,913
Hey, Pearl.

673
00:31:08,853 --> 00:31:11,149
I think you'd better take this guy.
- Oh, of course.

674
00:31:15,526 --> 00:31:17,424
Pearl, you'd better take this one too.

675
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:23,623
Will you join in with me?
- Too right.

No, I wouldn't say that.
- I know you do.

There are really other things in
the world beside racetracks.

00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,395
Well, yes. I suppose there are.
- You've never been to Europe, have you?

00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:56,291
Nope.

744
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:57,880

You mean Ascot, Epsom Downs, Newmarket?

They must be swell.

747
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:04,038
No. I wasn't thinking about racetracks.

748
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,175
Oh no. That's right.

749
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:08,811

and know just what the artist ..

756
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,151
Wanted you to feel when he
painted it 400 years ago?

00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:31,209
No, I never did.
- Well, I learned all of those things.

758
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:34,442
You know what you'd like?
Punting on the Thames.

759
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,385
With the oaks making a green
roof and the sky coming through.

760
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:39,380
Hey, I did punt once when I was a kid.

761
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,092
In a mud scow on the Ohio.

762
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:44,244
There are so many things to do
in the world. So many things to see.

763
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,226
And so many wonderful people to meet.

764
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:49,103
Now, Carol. I never got you before.
I begin to see what you're driving at.

765
00:35:49,322 --> 00:35:50,490
You are?
- Yeah.

766
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,993
I believe I'd go for those things myself
in a big way if I wasn't such a mug.

767
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:56,488
You're not a mug. You've got
brains, looks, personality ..

768
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:58,453
Will you quit your kidding.
- I'm not kidding.

769
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:01,850
Gee honey, it kinda gives me
a lift to know you feel that way.

770
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:03,811
I'm all for you getting
the things you want.

771
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:05,374
Thanks. I'm glad you understand.

772
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:07,740
I do. But you never put it to
me straight like that before.

773
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,952
I know. I'm sorry.

774
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:10,515
Say look.

775
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,684
I've got an idea that will put us both
closer to punting on the Thames.

776
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,347
You have? What is it?

777
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,449
When you get to Florida,
where will you stay?

778
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:19,248
The Park Central. Well go on, Duke.

779
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:22,672
Well, when we get there .. you phone
Madison and have him come down.

780
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,580
Now all you have to do is to say the
word and he'll come running. Then.

781
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:28,613
Let him do a little betting with me.
I'll cut you in for 20% of my winnings.

782
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:31,157
And gee honey, you'll have that
market paid off in no time at all.

783
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,251
Get out of here.

784
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,742
What?
- I said get out of here.

785
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:36,390
Why, what's the matter?

786
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,741
Nothing, except that I thought
you had a grain of decency.

787
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:39,976
Don't be like that.

788
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:41,969
You brought me here just
for this. Now get out.

789
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:43,817
You'll get wise to ..
- Get out of here.

790
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,173
Alright, alright.

791
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,032
Carol, you don't belong to this ..
- I said, get out!

792
00:36:58,232 --> 00:36:59,526
Why, Miss Carol.

793
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:02,009
Tell me child, what is the matter?

794
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,014
I never want to see that
cheap, swell-headed ..

795
00:37:05,134 --> 00:37:08,058
Smart-aleck bookmaker
again as long as I live.

796
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:10,656
Oh Miss Carol. Why, honey.

797
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:11,536
Baby.

798
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:17,129
Just a minute, please.
- Hello, Mr Madison.

799
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,780
Hello Bradley.

800
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,733
Why are you in New York?
- I came to see you.

801
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:21,807
Really?
- Yes.

802
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:24,045
This place is tougher to
crash than the pearly gates.

803
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:26,731
Duke, will you excuse me just a minute?
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

804
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:27,789
Where was I?

805
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:29,983
'If they could be procured
on a satisfactory basis ..'

806
00:37:30,263 --> 00:37:34,553
I am willing to pay 101 net to me for a
commitment up to a million and a half.

807
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:36,995
Kindly advise me regarding
this immediately.

808
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:39,031
Yours, etc. That's all.

809
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,409
Shall we do any of that new
government issue, Mr Madison?

810
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:44,356
I'll see about that later on.
- Yes, sir.

811
00:37:45,402 --> 00:37:46,818
Now what can I do for you, Duke?

812
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:49,022
Well.

813
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:50,852
It's about Carol.

814
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:52,282
Carol? What's wrong?

815
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:54,487
Carol needs you, Mr Madison.
She's not well.

816
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:57,648
No? Why, I spoke to her last night in
Baltimore before she left for Florida.

817
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,149
Did she seem alright?

818
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:02,029
She didn't say anything about not being.
- She didn't seem nervous, irritable?

819
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:03,867
Well, now you mention it. Yes she did.

820
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:06,154
Yes, yes. You know,
Carol is not her old self at all.

821
00:38:06,274 --> 00:38:07,613
She's seen a doctor?
- No.

822
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:09,644
No she hasn't and she's
just a bundle of nerves.

823
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:12,677
Why, do you know that last night on the
train I tried to make her send for you.

824
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:15,081
And believe it or not she ordered
me out of the compartment.

825
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:16,886
She did?
- Yes. Flew into a rage.

826
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:18,719
That's bad, Duke. That's very bad.

827
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,550
She takes this job of hers so seriously.
- Yes. I'm afraid she does.

828
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,784
I think you should go to
Florida and talk with her.

829
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,232
Well, maybe you are right.

830
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:28,829
Yes. With you there to bounce around the
track and help her pick those winners ..

831
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:31,477
I'll go, Duke. I'll go right away and ..

832
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:34,026
And say, I'll take Dr Bierd with me.
That's what I'll do.

833
00:38:34,347 --> 00:38:36,965
He'll find out what's the matter.
Hello, get me Dr Bierd on the phone.

834
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,274
Dr Harmsworth Bierd.
- Now look, Mr Madison.

835
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:41,808
You needn't do that. There's
plenty of good doctors down there.

836
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:44,449
Nobody like Bierd. The best nerve
specialist this side of Vienna.

837
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:47,110
Yes, I know. But a big doctor like
that, he might upset her terribly.

838
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,075
But at least he'll find
out what's the matter.

839
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:53,031
Hello? Hello Dr Bierd, can you fly
to Florida with me right away?

840
00:38:53,151 --> 00:38:54,786
Now look, Mr Madison, I don't think ..

841
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:56,646
We are going today.
It is for my fiancée.

842
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:58,981
It's a bad case of nerves and
I want you to look her over.

843
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:01,860
Well, we're leaving from Roosevelt
Field in a couple of hours.

844
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:03,920
Uhuh. Alright, I'll pick you up.

845
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:05,257
Goodbye.

846
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:15,648
May I assist you, Miss Washington?
- Thank you, Mr Meyers.

847
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:18,766
Why, Miss Carol, there is Mr Madison.

848
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,229
Don't be silly, Rosetta.
Mr Madison is in New York.

849
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:22,301
Carol.

850
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:26,352
Darling.
- Hello, honey.

851
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,681
Why sweetheart, what's the matter?
- What are you doing down here?

852
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:32,064
Darling, Duke said you weren't
feeling up to scratch.

853
00:39:32,184 --> 00:39:33,019
Oh, he did?

854
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:35,255
See, I had to go back to
New York on business.

855
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,363
So, naturally I dropped
in to see Hartley and ..

856
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:39,065
Well, here we are.

857
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,864
Thought I'd help you pick some winners.
- I don't need any help.

858
00:39:42,268 --> 00:39:44,772
Why Carol, of course you don't.
And darling, it's ..

859
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:46,174
Oh, Dr Bierd.

860
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,869
Oh yes. Dr Bierd just happened
to be coming down too.

861
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,910
This is Miss Clayton, Dr Bierd.

862
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:52,122
Oh yes, yes.

863
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:54,118
How do you do, my dear?
- How do you do.

864
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:56,104
I thought Dr Bierd could look you over.

865
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:58,224
What for? What is the meaning of this?

866
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,905
You see, Hartley was very worried ..
- What are you talking about?

867
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,907
Now don't get excited.
- Who's excited?

868
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:04,743
Nobody. I'm sorry if I upset you.

869
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:07,199
I'm not upset, but
let's get out of here.

870
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:08,899
Carol. Carol.

871
00:40:09,264 --> 00:40:10,680
Haven't you forgotten something?

872
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:11,625
What?

873
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,714
Oh well, go ahead dear. Don't mind us.

874
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,351
Of course not.

875
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:19,333
Of course not, what?

876
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:21,466
You haven't kissed Hartley hello.

877
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,226
Aren't you glad to see him?
- What do you think?

878
00:40:34,713 --> 00:40:38,263
This is absolutely ridiculous, doctor.
I said there's nothing wrong with me.

879
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:40,020
Quiet now. Just relax.

880
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:44,843
Miss Clayton, when was your
wedding originally planned?

881
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,306
Last August.
- That's five months ago.

882
00:40:47,937 --> 00:40:49,454
Dear, dear, dear, dear.

883
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,968
There's nothing organically
wrong with that little heart.

884
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:56,118
But it's beating much, much too fast.

885
00:40:56,502 --> 00:40:57,954
I told you I was alright.

886
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:01,625
Of course. But you are a
highly emotional type.

887
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:03,591
What are you drivelling about?

888
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:07,334
You are a woman who's entire system
is regulated by her emotions.

889
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:09,582
You should be married now.

890
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:13,998
And cooing contentedly in
your own dear little nest.

891
00:41:17,212 --> 00:41:17,917
What?

892
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:22,483
And now I want you to take a soothing
lukewarm effervescent bath.

893
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,892
I will send you a masseuse who'll
give you a light gentle massage.

894
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:32,262
And then in this quiet, darkened room
you can have a restful, peaceful nap.

895
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:35,258
I've let you spoil my day at the track.

896
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:40,808
But I won't take a warm, dark
effervescent nap for you or anyone else.

897
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:43,256
Dear, dear, dear. Mr Madison
should never have come down.

898
00:41:43,528 --> 00:41:45,396
Neither should you.
- Now, now. My dear child.

899
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:48,378
There is nothing wrong with me.
I am perfectly normal.

900
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:50,451
That's just it. Entirely too normal.

901
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:55,304
I suggest you see as little as possible
of your fiancée until you are married.

902
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,234
And I hope I may soon have the pleasure
of an invitation to that wedding.

903
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:06,843
Goodbye.

904
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,508
Bless your heart.

905
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:12,839
Hey ho.

906
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:19,953
What is it?
- Oh, it's nothing, really.

907
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:21,791
Are you alright, darling?

908
00:42:24,603 --> 00:42:25,561
What's happened?

909
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:26,928
It's just nerves.

910
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:28,749
You see, she's ..

911
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:31,627
Would you excuse us?
- Yes.

912
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,607
What did you find? Is it serious?
- Yes.

913
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,509
But it's no case for a doctor.

914
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:38,768
Well, what is it?

915
00:42:39,617 --> 00:42:43,575
'<i>Amor solum a medicina
sanari non posse</i>'.

916
00:42:43,943 --> 00:42:45,213
What does that mean?

917
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,412
It means that love
cannot be cured by pills.

00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:22,648
Sweetheart.

1072
00:49:23,362 --> 00:49:24,904
Well, what is it, Hartley?

1073
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:27,588
When did you ..?

1074
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,183
When did you ..?

1075
00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:31,736
When did I what?

1076
00:49:32,862 --> 00:49:34,743
When did you start smoking cigars?

1077
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:37,669
Oh, I just picked it up.

1078
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,677
I am trying to obey
doctor's orders. He said ..

1079
00:49:40,953 --> 00:49:42,209
No more cigarettes.

1080
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,616
But dear, you'll make yourself ill.

1081
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:46,414
Yes.

1082
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,795
Well, I've got to do
something for my nerves.

1083
00:49:48,915 --> 00:49:51,108
I know darling, but cigars?
And that's a strong one.

1084
00:49:53,543 --> 00:49:54,629
I know. I ..

1085
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:58,536
I won't smoke it anymore if
you don't want me to, Hartley.

1086
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:00,188
You poor darling.

1087
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:02,349
I'm so worried about you.

1088
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:04,096
But you mustn't worry about me.

1089
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:06,618
What is it, sweet?

1090
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:08,150
Hartley.

1091
00:50:08,903 --> 00:50:10,497
I wish you'd stay in Florida.

1092
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,081
You do, dear?
- Yes.

1093
00:50:12,372 --> 00:50:14,473
Well, darling, I'd only
be too happy to stay.

1094
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:16,485
That is .. well ..

1095
00:50:17,063 --> 00:50:19,950
If you are sure my being
here wouldn't upset you.

1096
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,217
Why, of course it wouldn't upset me.
I want you to stay.

1097
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:26,420
But you said this afternoon ..
- Yes. I know.

1098
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,043
But I'm nervous. Sometimes ..

1099
00:50:28,265 --> 00:50:30,478
I want you to go and
sometimes I want you to stay.

1100
00:50:30,598 --> 00:50:32,403
Right now I want you to stay.
- I know.

1101
00:50:32,523 --> 00:50:34,042
What difference if <i>I</i> am nervous?

1102
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:36,287
What difference if<i> I</i> am a little upset?

1103
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:38,146
I want you stay.

1104
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:40,766
Don't you see, darling?
I couldn't do that.

1105
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,587
You are too considerate, Hartley.

1106
00:50:43,078 --> 00:50:45,902
You always think of
everybody but yourself.

1107
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:47,745
Why shouldn't <i>you</i> have a holiday?

1108
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,712
Darling, I'm going to go.

1109
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,876
Please.
- No.

1110
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,516
Please, Hartley.
- No more.

1111
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:55,054
You mustn't go. You can't go.
I won't let you.

1112
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:59,247
Darling, we settled
all that this afternoon.

1113
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:00,666
Now please calm yourself.

1114
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:03,403
And believe me darling,
I know what's best.

1115
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,251
Alright .. whatever you say.

1116
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:07,822
Goodbye, sweet.

1117
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,057
Bless your little heart.

1118
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,954
You will go straight to bed
now won't you, darling.

1119
00:51:17,314 --> 00:51:20,018
And please don't smoke
any more of those things.

1120
00:51:20,232 --> 00:51:21,015
I won't.

1121
00:51:21,135 --> 00:51:22,619
I'll phone when I get to New York.

1122
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:24,201
Goodbye.
- Goodbye, darling.

1123
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:30,346
Why, the man is an iceberg.

1124
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,820
Now I've got to steam
him up all over again.

1125
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,034
I hope you weren't too uncomfortable.

1126
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:38,249
Well, it was pretty warm
until you smoked that cigar.

1127
00:51:38,438 --> 00:51:39,769
I'll send you a box sometime.

1128
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,249
Oh but baby, how you
went to town for Dukey.

1129
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:45,938
You idiot. I did the one thing
that would send him away.

1130
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,071
You did? What was that?
- I kissed him.

1131
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:51,264
And that sent him away?
Oh Carol, you underestimate yourself.

1132
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,281
You don't understand.
Hartley happens to be a gentleman.

1133
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:56,245
Oh. Then I'm glad I'm a mug.

1134
00:51:56,608 --> 00:51:58,280
Kiss me like that and see if I go home.

1135
00:51:58,544 --> 00:51:59,245
Well ..

1136
00:52:00,152 --> 00:52:02,802
You don't think that I tried to make
him stay here for you, do you?

1137
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:06,039
Oh no, no. Of course not.
Why, I never dreamed of it.

1138
00:52:06,563 --> 00:52:07,789
I sent him away.
- Yeah.

1139
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:10,684
You don't believe me, do you?
- Sure, sure. I believe you.

1140
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,890
Didn't I hear it?

1141
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,932
He went because the
doctor told him I was ..

1142
00:52:14,052 --> 00:52:16,154
The doctor told him that you were what?
- That I was ..

1143
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:18,308
Nothing.

1144
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:20,337
Will you please leave?

1145
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:22,444
Honey.

1146
00:52:23,113 --> 00:52:23,928
I love you.

1147
00:52:42,983 --> 00:52:44,347
You and your sucker, huh?

1148
00:52:44,755 --> 00:52:48,828
We trail him to New York. I bet you all
I got against a quarter we get him back.

1149
00:52:49,115 --> 00:52:51,405
Yeah. Just like your girlfriend
got him to stay here for you.

1150
00:52:51,574 --> 00:52:54,503
Carol tried to get him to stay. She went
to town for me like a little champion.

1151
00:52:54,736 --> 00:52:57,911
She did, huh? She double-crossed
you like a 6th Avenue girl.

1152
00:52:58,212 --> 00:53:00,448
And you thought you were
shoving her around. Ha.

1153
00:53:00,898 --> 00:53:03,396
What a ladies' man. What a ladies' man.

1154
00:53:03,704 --> 00:53:04,519
Hello Duke.

1155
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:08,084
Will you say that again?
- Say what?

1156
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:10,648
Well, is it really you?
- Surprised, are you?

1157
00:53:11,082 --> 00:53:13,216
Well, no. Not exactly. Sit down.
- Thanks.

1158
00:53:13,763 --> 00:53:17,004
Carol fairly insisted on my staying.
She stopped me at the airport.

1159
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:18,786
She did?
- Yeah.

1160
00:53:20,056 --> 00:53:21,435
Well, bless her little heart.

1161
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,511
Meet Carol's fiancée.
This is my sheet writer.

1162
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:26,672
How do you do.
- I'm certainly pleased to meet you.

1163
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,983
Thanks .. say Duke, there is
horse Carol likes today: <i>Rester</i>.

1164
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,970
Rester?
- Yes.

1165
00:53:32,227 --> 00:53:34,465
Did you say 'Rester'?
- And Carol likes him?

1166
00:53:34,662 --> 00:53:35,335
Yeah.

1167
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:38,789
Well, he's in this next race.
They are at the post now.

1168
00:53:38,964 --> 00:53:40,622
Oh is he? What price can you give me?

1169
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:42,780
7-1.
- 7-1?

1170
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:45,990
How about five thousand?
- Hartley, you got a bet.

1171
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,663
Where's the lady?

1172
00:53:47,783 --> 00:53:49,575
She's a headache.
She's staying in her room.

1173
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,144
Oh, that's too bad. I'm sorry.

1174
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,610
Come on, Rester. Come on, Rester!

1175
00:54:06,548 --> 00:54:08,375
Say .. where is Rester now?

1176
00:54:08,876 --> 00:54:10,635
I'm afraid he's running a bad third.

1177
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:12,077
Yes. I am afraid.

1178
00:54:17,265 --> 00:54:18,015
Come on.

1179
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,223
Rester seems to be falling behind.

1180
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:22,304
Slightly.

1181
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:29,737
Yes, he's now running a deep last.
- Carol must have had a headache.

1182
00:54:30,713 --> 00:54:31,914
Yes, she must have.

1183
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:42,437
Well, he'll be home in time for dinner.

1184
00:54:43,386 --> 00:54:45,151
Anyway, it took eight
horses to beat him.

1185
00:54:45,271 --> 00:54:47,923
That's right. Well, I've got to get
back to the hotel and see Carol.

1186
00:54:48,043 --> 00:54:49,425
Give her my love.
- Thanks.

1187
00:54:49,545 --> 00:54:52,163
I'll give you a check tonight, Duke.
- Alright. Put it on tomorrow's bet.

1188
00:54:52,347 --> 00:54:54,066
Thanks. See you later, boys.
- So long.

1189
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:57,038
Well, I've certainly
got to hand it to you.

1190
00:54:57,684 --> 00:54:59,639
Is he worthwhile waiting for.

1191
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,688
But .. why did she ever pick Rester?

1192
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:06,225
Why do you think?
- Huh?

1193
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,385
[ Whistle ]

1194
00:55:10,366 --> 00:55:11,499
Dukey, I love you.

1195
00:55:23,471 --> 00:55:24,630
Mr Bradley.
- Morning.

1196
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,380
One?

1197
00:55:25,612 --> 00:55:27,657
Hello, Duke. How's things
at Huntingdon Downs?

1198
00:55:27,777 --> 00:55:28,651
Okay.

1199
00:55:32,274 --> 00:55:33,344
No, never mind.

1200
00:55:34,281 --> 00:55:36,665
Well, this is luck.
Good morning, honey. How are you?

1201
00:55:36,973 --> 00:55:37,754
Duke.

1202
00:55:37,954 --> 00:55:40,386
Oh madam, you look broadminded.
I've loved this woman for years.

1203
00:55:40,506 --> 00:55:42,667
You're lucky. Mine only lasted two days.

1204
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:44,609
Duke, you remember my husband?

1205
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:46,876
Oh yes. Brother Kiffmeyer.
How do you do?

1206
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:49,154
How do you do.
- I didn't know you were on the train.

1207
00:55:49,274 --> 00:55:50,867
No, that's quite obvious.

1208
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:52,935
Would you mind dropping my wife's hand?

1209
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:56,554
Where would I drop it? Out the window?
- Don't try to laugh your way out of it.

1210
00:55:56,674 --> 00:55:58,718
Madam, I ask you. Is there
anything wrong with this?

1211
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:00,883
I wish she'd change places with me.
- There. You see?

1212
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,090
There <i>you</i> see.

1213
00:56:02,273 --> 00:56:05,074
You were so afraid my wife would be
lonely if I didn't buy her horses.

1214
00:56:05,194 --> 00:56:06,478
Well, I bought her horses.

1215
00:56:06,598 --> 00:56:10,038
And now I wonder whether she's around
the country with horses or whether ..

1216
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:11,956
She's around the horses with you.

1217
00:56:12,589 --> 00:56:13,776
You heard what she said.

1218
00:56:13,959 --> 00:56:16,428
Madam, would you rather be around
horses or would .. or would ..?

1219
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:18,536
Mister, I'm afraid you
don't understand us women.

1220
00:56:18,978 --> 00:56:20,705
I? I don't understand women?

1221
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:23,123
Madam. Do you know who I am?

1222
00:56:23,385 --> 00:56:26,187
I haven't the slightest idea.
- Yes. Well, I'm Harriet Hale.

1223
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:27,683
Not the beauty queen?

1224
00:56:27,803 --> 00:56:30,039
Exactly, and now Mr Bradley.
If you would ..

1225
00:56:30,227 --> 00:56:33,904
Can you say why your foundation cream
always cakes when you put on powder?

1226
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:36,316
Cakes? My cream cakes?

1227
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:38,246
Madam, you don't know how to apply it.

1228
00:56:38,793 --> 00:56:41,251
And madam, here for you ..
- I'd say you don't know how to make it.

1229
00:56:41,986 --> 00:56:44,481
Madam. Harriet Hale's foundation cream.

1230
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:47,177
Has been the basis for women's
beauty for twenty years.

1231
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:50,072
Now Mr Bradley, I just want ..
- Kiffy please.

1232
00:56:50,364 --> 00:56:52,242
Well, just a moment.
- So how do you apply it?

1233
00:56:52,926 --> 00:56:55,749
With a circular motion.
Don't you read the directions?

1234
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:57,050
I tried that.

1235
00:56:57,283 --> 00:57:00,031
Yes. Well, from now on madam,
your face is in your own hands.

1236
00:57:00,238 --> 00:57:02,111
That's a fine way to
talk to your public.

1237
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:03,084
Well I ..

1238
00:57:03,297 --> 00:57:04,559
Yes. Well, I'm sorry.

1239
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:06,124
I was distraught.

1240
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:07,380
Yes. I distraught him.

1241
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:08,954
You keep out of this.

1242
00:57:09,273 --> 00:57:12,246
If you come to my compartment, madam,
I will show you how to apply it.

1243
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:13,363
May I watch?

1244
00:57:14,352 --> 00:57:16,215
If you so much as speak to your wife ..

1245
00:57:16,465 --> 00:57:17,902
I mean .. his wife.

1246
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:20,275
We know whose wife you mean, darling.

1247
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:21,471
Well just ..

1248
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:24,735
Mr Hale, you'll never know how my face
looked before I used your preparation.

1249
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:26,436
Yes. Well, I can imagine.

1250
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:28,664
All I want to say to
you, Mr Bradley is ..

1251
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:31,423
I don't fool you for a minute.
I mean you don't fool ..

1252
00:57:31,543 --> 00:57:32,964
You're a pernicious influence.

1253
00:57:33,084 --> 00:57:35,703
Oh Kiffy, why don't you show
the lady how to use the cream?

1254
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:38,531
Oh, so you want to get
rid of me. That's it, is it?

1255
00:57:38,828 --> 00:57:39,573
Alright.

1256
00:57:39,819 --> 00:57:42,145
I'll see you in the compartment.
And alone.

1257
00:57:44,134 --> 00:57:46,178
Do you think he can do my face any good?

1258
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:48,896
Well, look at me madam.
And I'm forty-five years old.

1259
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:51,755
Why, you don't look twenty-five.

1260
00:57:51,893 --> 00:57:54,491
Well, that's what Harriet
Hale has done for me.

1261
00:57:55,823 --> 00:57:58,293
What's the number of
Mr Hale's compartment?

1262
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,236
6B. Car 51.

1263
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:02,282
Thank you. I'll leave the door open.

1264
00:58:04,084 --> 00:58:04,842
Thanks.

1265
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:08,109
Poor Kiffy. Isn't he an old darling.

1266
00:58:08,492 --> 00:58:10,636
The salt of the earth.
If he just wasn't so jealous.

1267
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,560
Not only that. You know. He's a pretty
smart guy when he's away from the track.

1268
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:16,465
A lot smarter than I'd be.
- Good morning.

1269
00:58:16,585 --> 00:58:18,257
Good morning.
- Good morning, Rosetta.

1270
00:58:18,377 --> 00:58:20,454
How is Miss Carol?
- That cold she caught is worse.

1271
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:22,095
It is?
- Yes, Mr Duke.

1272
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,885
I came to get her some more juice
so she can take some castor oil ..

1273
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:26,842
But I know she won't take it.
- Yes she will.

1274
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,942
You hustle up the orange juice.
Bring me some too.

1275
00:58:29,062 --> 00:58:29,820
Yes, sir.

1276
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:31,548
I'd say it's tough on a kid ..

1277
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:34,028
Knocking around the country all
alone trying to beat the ponies.

1278
00:58:34,189 --> 00:58:34,805
Yes.

1279
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,541
You're in love with
her Duke, aren't you?

1280
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:38,880
Who?
- Carol.

1281
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:42,111
What makes you think so?
- Oh, I've been around the block.

1282
00:58:42,534 --> 00:58:43,750
I knew it before you did.

1283
00:58:44,657 --> 00:58:46,960
No you didn't. I knew it the
first time I took a hinge at her.

1284
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:48,353
Why don't you tell her so?

1285
00:58:48,488 --> 00:58:50,463
Well Fritzi, Carol's father
was my best friend.

1286
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:53,939
The last thing he ever said to me was he
wanted her to get away from this racket.

1287
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:56,011
To be something better
than a dressed-up gypsy.

1288
00:58:56,268 --> 00:58:58,229
I can't ask her to leave
what Madison gives her ..

1289
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:00,057
Just to knock around
a racetrack with me.

1290
00:59:00,177 --> 00:59:02,194
If she loved you, she'd be
happy staying in a barn.

1291
00:59:02,314 --> 00:59:03,209
No, Fritzi.

1292
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:06,034
I haven't the dough to fix up Brookvale
the way it was for her and grandpa.

1293
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,861
And to sure that it would always be
kept that way. You know, security.

1294
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,892
And I expect to get it from Mr Madison.

1295
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:16,566
Madison is going to make
you and Carol comfortable?

1296
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,549
And grandpa.

1297
00:59:19,231 --> 00:59:22,241
Why, you magnificent so and so.

1298
00:59:23,172 --> 00:59:24,216
Fritzi, I love you.

1299
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,543
I'll go and give her that medicine.

1300
00:59:31,102 --> 00:59:32,422
Who is it?
- It's Duke.

1301
00:59:33,763 --> 00:59:34,664
Just a minute.

1302
00:59:41,076 --> 00:59:43,025
What's the matter, honey?
- I'm not dressed.

1303
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:46,180
Well, put on something.

1304
00:59:47,227 --> 00:59:48,866
I don't look good in 'something'.

1305
00:59:49,148 --> 00:59:50,612
Well then, put on 'anything'.

1306
00:59:53,842 --> 00:59:55,683
You could be dressed
for the Arctic by now.

1307
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:56,706
Come in.

1308
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:58,852
Good morning, honey.

1309
00:59:59,616 --> 01:00:01,196
How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

1310
01:00:01,624 --> 01:00:03,457
Say, you look great in that Kimono.

1311
01:00:03,732 --> 01:00:05,098
Thanks, but it's a negligee.

1312
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,168
Well, what did you want, Duke?
- What?

1313
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:10,663
Oh, I came to doctor that cold of yours.

1314
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:14,844
Hey, you've got a fever.
- No, it's warm in here. That's all.

1315
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,489
Oh yeah? Well, I think you'd
better get into this bed.

1316
01:00:18,258 --> 01:00:20,361
Were you in this horse blanket
when I knocked just now?

1317
01:00:21,097 --> 01:00:22,484
Yes. Rosetta brought it for me.

1318
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,871
Alright. You get right back in it.
I know you're pretty.

1319
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:26,955
Well. But I ..
- Come, now. Get in this bed.

1320
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:30,180
This is more work that I've done
for a woman since my mother.

1321
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:34,206
You got any goose-grease around here?
- There is something in that case there.

1322
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:35,929
But I don't need anything, Duke.

1323
01:00:36,158 --> 01:00:38,402
Hey, that's a pretty swell layout.
Everything but a pipe.

1324
01:00:38,522 --> 01:00:39,908
A present from Hartley?
- Yes.

1325
01:00:40,028 --> 01:00:42,295
Isn't that just like him.
Thoughtful until the last detail.

1326
01:00:42,562 --> 01:00:45,212
I don't want that. It smells.
- Alright then. Hold your nose.

1327
01:00:46,966 --> 01:00:49,889
Did Kiffy and Fritzi make the train?
- Sure. I just left them.

1328
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:50,944
Oh you did?

1329
01:00:52,313 --> 01:00:53,700
Are you in love with her, Duke?

1330
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:55,598
With Fritzi? How you talk.

1331
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,429
Well, Kiffy thinks you are.

1332
01:00:57,618 --> 01:00:59,957
Did he tell you that, too?
Isn't he cute, the old sweetheart.

1333
01:01:00,516 --> 01:01:01,749
Only me and fifty others.

1334
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:04,741
Roll over.
- No. I don't want to.

1335
01:01:05,221 --> 01:01:06,970
Come on, roll over.
- Oh Duke.

1336
01:01:11,594 --> 01:01:12,610
What's the matter?

1337
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,738
Oh, I was thinking about
that night in Miami.

1338
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,669
When you tried to smoke my cigar?
- If I live to be a thousand ..

1339
01:01:18,789 --> 01:01:21,464
I'll never forget the way you looked
coming out from underneath that couch.

1340
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,434
Lie still, will you.

1341
01:01:27,326 --> 01:01:28,113
Lie still.

1342
01:01:30,115 --> 01:01:31,472
Okay, will you lie still.

1343
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:33,226
What's the matter?

1344
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:35,631
Here.

1345
01:01:40,022 --> 01:01:40,866
You alright?

1346
01:01:41,319 --> 01:01:41,934
Yes.

1347
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:44,628
I'm alright now.

1348
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:46,946
You had me scared there for a minute.

1349
01:01:47,873 --> 01:01:48,692
Hey, Duke.

1350
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:50,608
Yeah. What is it honey?

1351
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:54,387
I love you, Duke.

1352
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,241
Say, what are you trying to do?
Steal my gag line?

1353
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,435
Isn't it about time we
quit kidding ourselves.

1354
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:02,333
Kidding ourselves?
- Yes.

1355
01:02:02,513 --> 01:02:04,867
I've just been riding Hartley.
Breaking our engagement.

1356
01:02:05,444 --> 01:02:06,202
You what?

1357
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,138
It's all over. I never
want to see him again.

1358
01:02:08,317 --> 01:02:10,687
You never want to see him again?
- No, I'm breaking it all off.

1359
01:02:11,203 --> 01:02:13,469
Great guns, honey. He'll be
coming down to Kentucky.

1360
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:15,439
You can't do that to me.

1361
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:17,292
What?

1362
01:02:18,216 --> 01:02:20,959
I can't do <i>what </i>to you?
- Take my chump out of circulation.

1363
01:02:21,903 --> 01:02:23,001
I can't ..?

1364
01:02:24,629 --> 01:02:25,999
I can't do it to you?

1365
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,317
Well, how do you like that.
- What's the matter?

1366
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:32,655
I see what I've been to you.
Just a come on, a steer girl.

1367
01:02:32,775 --> 01:02:36,425
Will you talk sense. Stop dramatizing.
- A steer girl, just a steer girl.

1368
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,239
There you see. Now get
back under those covers.

1369
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,595
You get out of my room.

1370
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,561
You get back under those covers. What
are you trying to do? Catch pneumonia.

1371
01:02:43,756 --> 01:02:45,553
Here, take this.
- It's the wrong one.

1372
01:02:45,673 --> 01:02:47,276
I will not.
- Take it.

1373
01:02:48,552 --> 01:02:49,281
Alright.

1374
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:52,546
Now, that's a fine thing to do.

1375
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,121
And to think I nearly let
him go. A man. A real man.

1376
01:02:55,241 --> 01:02:57,870
That's just what I was telling you.
The most beautiful man in the world.

1377
01:02:58,124 --> 01:03:00,738
He is, eh? Right, I'll get him for you.
- You will?

1378
01:03:01,005 --> 01:03:03,774
I'll get him for you in Kentucky.
- Honey, now you're talking.

1379
01:03:04,104 --> 01:03:05,293
I'll handicap for him ..

1380
01:03:05,413 --> 01:03:08,144
And he'll wind you up on a street
corner with a tin cup in your hand.

1381
01:03:08,392 --> 01:03:10,060
Thank you, honey. And here's luck.

1382
01:03:11,702 --> 01:03:12,754
My, my.

1383
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:50,843
Dixie Gordon has grabbed
the lead and he's riding pretty.

1384
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:54,098
Looks like you made a bad bet, Hartley.
- Hurley's passed him though.

1385
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:01,025
When Gordon gets out
in front he's hard to catch.

1386
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:04,081
Hurley is riding the best horse though.
That's why Carol picked him.

1387
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,571
Hurley is moving up. Come on.

1388
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:22,731
Hurley is giving him his head.
He will pass Gordon at the turn.

1389
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:25,140
Want to double your bet?
I'll give you four to one now.

1390
01:04:26,064 --> 01:04:27,347
Huh?
- 4-1.

1391
01:04:28,474 --> 01:04:29,302
Take it.

1392
01:04:29,627 --> 01:04:30,671
Okay.
- You're on.

1393
01:04:42,652 --> 01:04:45,874
Gordon is sure giving your horse a ride.
- He certainly is.

1394
01:04:52,274 --> 01:04:54,639
Try it on the outside, Hurley.
- I've got the right of way.

1395
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:56,964
Stay back or I'll put
you into the fence.

1396
01:05:07,812 --> 01:05:09,506
Who went down?
- Hurley.

1397
01:05:09,817 --> 01:05:10,674
Hurley?

1398
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:12,339
That's done it.

1399
01:05:14,095 --> 01:05:16,627
The little fellow is alright, honey.
Just shaken up a bit, that's all.

1400
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:20,265
Can you beat that Dixie coming home on a
nag that couldn't pull a laundry wagon.

1401
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:28,909
Duke .. Duke.

1402
01:05:29,288 --> 01:05:30,027
Fritzi.

1403
01:05:30,147 --> 01:05:33,282
Did you see Dixie ride? And I have him.
I got him on contract for The Hopeful.

1404
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:34,442
What?
- Yeah.

1405
01:05:34,562 --> 01:05:36,318
So The Hopeful is in
your pocket, Fritzi.

1406
01:05:36,438 --> 01:05:37,511
Honey, I love you.

1407
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:40,825
Wait a minute. I want you all to witness
that I've ordered this man to keep ..

1408
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:45,191
It's alright. Don't apologise.
- I'm not apologising to you.

1409
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:48,090
You keep away from my wife.
That's all I'm telling you now or ..

1410
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:49,810
Kiffy, look out.

1411
01:05:51,026 --> 01:05:52,413
You've got the horses doing it.

1412
01:05:53,222 --> 01:05:55,309
Don't you try to laugh
your way out of this.

1413
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,223
I can't stay around horses. Come on.

1414
01:06:00,661 --> 01:06:01,991
You'd better watch out, Duke.

1415
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:04,863
Do you mind, dear? Let's go.
- Right, darling. See you at the hotel.

1416
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,470
Fine. Too bad you lost today.
Better luck next time.

1417
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:09,473
Thank you, honey.
- What for?

1418
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:11,421
For getting Hartley to double his bet.

1419
01:06:13,822 --> 01:06:15,489
What do you want to make her mad for?

1420
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:19,243
The madder she gets, the more she makes
him bet and the worse she handicaps him.

1421
01:06:19,522 --> 01:06:21,242
Hey, son.
- Yes? A Coke?

1422
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:23,076
No, no. I just want one of these cups.

1423
01:06:23,911 --> 01:06:25,998
Take her this and tell her
I'm sorry it isn't tin.

1424
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,230
Thank you.

1425
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,349
Oh, Carol.

1426
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:32,679
Duke asked me to give you this and
tell you he's sorry it isn't tin.

1427
01:06:52,487 --> 01:06:53,540
My, my.

1428
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:57,451
Oh Miss Carol, here is some
more tin cups from Mr Duke.

1429
01:06:57,654 --> 01:06:59,041
Throw them out.
- All of them?

1430
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:00,528
Throw them out.
- Yes, ma'am.

1431
01:07:00,781 --> 01:07:02,384
Does you want to hear the note?
- No.

1432
01:07:02,504 --> 01:07:04,617
Well, it says: 'Remember Dukey'.

1433
01:07:04,946 --> 01:07:05,990
Ain't he the tease?

1434
01:07:06,282 --> 01:07:07,995
He teases me about my complexion.

1435
01:07:08,205 --> 01:07:10,608
And he teases you about
Mr Madison losing all that money.

1436
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:12,926
And he teases Mr Kiffmeyer
about his wife.

1437
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:14,995
He's always teasing somebody.

1438
01:07:15,175 --> 01:07:17,111
But nobody gets mad except
you and Mr Kiffmeyer.

1439
01:07:17,231 --> 01:07:18,618
Get me the United States Hotel.

1440
01:07:18,923 --> 01:07:21,507
These cups is just what I need
to put my knick-knacks in.

1441
01:07:21,695 --> 01:07:23,168
Throw them things in the ashcan.

1442
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:25,427
Get Mr Kiffmeyer. Mr Jesse Kiffmeyer.

1443
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:28,194
Can't I have just one
to remember him by?

1444
01:07:28,464 --> 01:07:29,936
Throw those things in the ashcan.

1445
01:07:30,056 --> 01:07:31,220
Hello? Hello?

1446
01:07:34,344 --> 01:07:35,062
Hello?

1447
01:07:35,508 --> 01:07:37,618
Yes, this is .. oh, Miss Clayton.

1448
01:07:39,175 --> 01:07:41,323
Yes, of course Dixie Gordon's
contract is in my name.

1449
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:43,307
You see, my financial responsibility ..

1450
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:46,283
Oh. My wife and that Bradley?

1451
01:07:47,288 --> 01:07:49,338
Yes. Well, I'd do anything. I mean ..

1452
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:50,932
Almost anything.

1453
01:07:52,182 --> 01:07:52,883
You do?

1454
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:55,180
Oh, you don't.

1455
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,796
Oh you do?

1456
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:59,430
Oh. You don't.

1457
01:08:00,065 --> 01:08:01,010
Well, I mean ..

1458
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,921
You do.

1459
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:07,480
Yes, you can have the contract.
You can have the horse if you want to.

1460
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:10,359
Well, just hold the phone.
I'll see if it's here.

1461
01:08:16,202 --> 01:08:18,312
Just .. one moment please.

1462

Here is to the greatest
two-year old in the world.

1483
01:09:31,872 --> 01:09:33,567
Hartley, what's his name?
- Moonray.

1484
01:09:33,808 --> 01:09:36,135
What a charming name.
Gentlemen, I give you Moonray.

1485
01:09:36,355 --> 01:09:38,330
I say Hartley, a racing
chap up at the hotel ..

1486
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:41,244
Has given me Dubonnet to
win on account of his jockey.

1487
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:44,227
Dixie Gordon is the best money
riding jockey on the turf.

1488
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:45,973
But Moonray is a great horse.

1489
01:09:46,217 --> 01:09:48,706
And horses have a little bit
to do with racing you know.

1490
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:50,966
Hartley, I'm afraid you prejudiced.

1491
01:09:51,597 --> 01:09:54,383
Maybe, but I think my horse is
going to win. And I'm backing ..

1492
01:09:55,182 --> 01:09:56,511
Ah, of course ..

1493
01:09:56,747 --> 01:09:59,147
Carol doesn't agree with me but
I'm backing him nevertheless.

1494
01:09:59,432 --> 01:10:01,417
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Shall we dance, darling?

1495
01:10:10,383 --> 01:10:11,985
Why do you aggravate me like this?

1496
01:10:12,331 --> 01:10:15,016
Wait a minute, Carol. I've lost a lot
of money on your handicapping.

1497
01:10:15,136 --> 01:10:16,954
If I want to bet on
my horse it's my risk.

1498
01:10:17,074 --> 01:10:18,464
But why must you bet tonight?

1499
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,618
By race time tomorrow,
Duke's odds might change.

1500
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:22,796
Hello there, you two lovebirds.
- Hello, Steve.

1501
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:25,456
Keep right on. We don't want
to interfere with romance.

1502
01:10:25,629 --> 01:10:26,468
Thank you.

1503
01:10:28,193 --> 01:10:31,638
I tell you Moonray can't win tomorrow
with Dixie Gordon on Dubonnet.

1504
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:33,904
That's your opinion, but my
new trainer thinks he can.

1505
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:35,918
Your new trainer is
trying to keep his job.

1506
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:38,701
He can't do any more for
Moonray than grandpa did.

1507
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:40,107
You're darn tooting.

1508
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:43,764
Putting a new-fangled
trainer on Moonray.

1509
01:10:44,262 --> 01:10:47,595
Why, I raised him on the bottle
from the time he was four.

1510
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:50,974
And nursed him through that
bad sickness in September.

1511
01:10:51,181 --> 01:10:52,311
We know that, grandpa.

1512
01:10:52,522 --> 01:10:55,572
His sire had distemper twice in '31.

1513
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:59,580
And his granddaddy had a quarter
crack a month before The Preakness.

1514
01:10:59,784 --> 01:11:00,992
And I cured them both.

1515
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:03,780
Did you know that?
- Yes. You told me that Mr Clayton.

1516
01:11:04,185 --> 01:11:06,343
Yeah. Well, they was both champions.

1517
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:09,178
Moonray will be a champion, too.

1518
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:14,238
Go and take him away from me just before
The Hopeful when he needs me the most.

1519
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:17,191
I've been just like a father to him.
- Oh, please, grandpa.

1520
01:11:17,384 --> 01:11:19,584
Moonray ain't going to fold up tomorrow.

1521
01:11:19,862 --> 01:11:22,474
I got him ready. He's a fit horse.

1522
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:23,495
And he'll win.

1523
01:11:24,003 --> 01:11:26,099
He ain't going to forget
nothing I told him.

1524
01:11:26,632 --> 01:11:28,462
Grandpa, why are you
taking your shoes off?

1525
01:11:28,768 --> 01:11:32,427
I'm taking them off so I won't
kick that new trainer of yours.

1526
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:35,777
That isn't funny, grandpa.
- You ain't funny either.

1527
01:11:36,453 --> 01:11:38,173
And he's blowed his topper.

1528
01:11:38,867 --> 01:11:40,854
Shall we go inside?
- Yes, Hartley.

1529
01:11:43,024 --> 01:11:43,880
Goodnight.

1530
01:11:46,544 --> 01:11:48,691
Confound this halter.

1531
01:11:49,582 --> 01:11:52,065
Household full of Newport chumps.

1532
01:11:52,828 --> 01:11:55,199
Nothing in the stable but dry rot.

1533
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:56,609
A new trainer.

1534
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:58,743
My dogs hurt.

1535
01:12:03,814 --> 01:12:05,680
Hey .. who are you?

1536
01:12:05,996 --> 01:12:08,022
Shush. Please, I'm a ..

1537
01:12:08,772 --> 01:12:10,982
Are you the caretaker here?
- Caretaker?

1538
01:12:11,155 --> 01:12:15,223
Why you infernal jackass.
My grandfather built this dump.

1539
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:18,852
Oh, well. I'm very sorry.
I want to see Miss Clayton.

1540
01:12:19,277 --> 01:12:20,138
What about?

1541
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:22,448
Well, it's .. it's something personal.

1542
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:24,666
Very Private?

1543
01:12:25,027 --> 01:12:27,122
Private? Why you old fool.

1544
01:12:27,497 --> 01:12:29,198
You're old enough to be her father.

1545
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,558
What do you mean? Are you insinuating?
Why, I am a married man.

1546
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:35,149
I wonder.
- Here you is, Mr Clayton.

1547
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,587
Would you tell Miss Clayton I would like
to see her at once? It's very important.

1548
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:41,812
Yes, sir. Come right in.
- No, ask her to come out here please.

1549
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:42,878
Yes, sir.

1550
01:12:43,599 --> 01:12:45,933
You know, I don't know what it is ..

1551
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:48,934
But there is something
about you I don't like.

1552
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:49,816
Oh.

1553
01:12:50,094 --> 01:12:53,803
Well, if you feel that way, I must say
I don't like you very much either.

1554
01:12:54,363 --> 01:12:55,523
Hello, Mr Kiffmeyer.

1555
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:57,549
Miss Clayton, I wanted ..

1556
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:00,148
Grandpa, do you mind?

1557
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,822
Do I mind what?

1558
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:02,874
It?

1559
01:13:03,137 --> 01:13:06,462
I'm going down to the
barn where it don't smell.

1560
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:10,303
Do you think that we'd better ..?

1561
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:14,821
Well, how about it?

1562
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:16,888
Well, it's a great idea, but do you ..

1563
01:13:17,275 --> 01:13:18,958
Think that I am doing the right thing?

1564
01:13:19,078 --> 01:13:20,894
Is Duke Bradley doing
the right thing to you?

1565
01:13:21,215 --> 01:13:25,038
No. But are you sure that your horse
will win if that Dixie Gordon rides him?

1566
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:26,480
I'll be my farm on it.

1567
01:13:27,201 --> 01:13:29,644
And will Mr Madison make a
large bet with that Bradley?

1568
01:13:29,848 --> 01:13:31,035
Big enough to break him.

1569
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:33,163
Yes. Well, that's all I want to know.

1570
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:34,307
Here it is.

1571
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:36,212
She tells me she doesn't care for him ..

1572
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:39,131
But I can't believe a word she says now
she's been running around with horses.

1573
01:13:39,251 --> 01:13:41,172
You have to sign this over
to me, Mr Kiffmeyer.

1574
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:42,281
Oh, yes.

1575
01:13:42,645 --> 01:13:45,558
But suppose that Bradley finds
out and won't take the bet?

1576
01:13:45,744 --> 01:13:48,891
He can't find out unless you tell him.
Don't tell the jockey until tomorrow.

1577
01:13:49,011 --> 01:13:50,168
Now, sign right here.

1578
01:13:50,463 --> 01:13:51,491
Yes, well.

1579
01:13:52,065 --> 01:13:52,919
Alright.

1580
01:13:53,621 --> 01:13:56,760
I've been trying to place this guy.
Do you know who he is?

1581
01:13:56,987 --> 01:13:58,603
His wife owns Dubonnet.

1582
01:13:58,723 --> 01:14:00,710
Go along, grandpa.
- He's up to something.

1583
01:14:00,918 --> 01:14:03,151
Look at him. He's as
guilty as a horse thief.

1584
01:14:03,343 --> 01:14:05,089
Now look here, Mr Clayton, you can't ..

1585
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:06,848
Will you desist.

1586
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:11,072
First of all he calls me a caretaker
and then tells me to 'desist'.

1587
01:14:11,401 --> 01:14:13,678
Get off this place.
- Now look here, grandpa.

1588
01:14:13,877 --> 01:14:16,730
Don't you call me grandpa.
- Will you leave us alone one minute.

1589
01:14:16,954 --> 01:14:19,788
Alright. But I don't trust that guy.

1590
01:14:20,035 --> 01:14:22,498
A house full of monkeys and no stud.

1591
01:14:22,806 --> 01:14:23,643
I don't ..

1592
01:14:23,763 --> 01:14:25,504
Hurry. Before we're
interfered with again.

1593
01:14:25,717 --> 01:14:26,653
Yes.

1594
01:14:27,226 --> 01:14:28,265
I hope this ..

1595
01:14:28,385 --> 01:14:30,734
Puts that Bradley where he belongs.
- So do I.

1596
01:14:31,184 --> 01:14:34,432
Yes, and I hope that nobody
will know I've been here.

1597
01:14:34,681 --> 01:14:35,973
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1598
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:37,793
Hello?

1599
01:14:38,053 --> 01:14:39,785
Saratoga 1-5-5-8.

1600
01:14:41,342 --> 01:14:43,579
Darling, do you think
this is quite right?

1601
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:44,806
Quite right?

1602
01:14:47,076 --> 01:14:48,705
Carol, have you and Duke had a quarrel?

1603
01:14:49,261 --> 01:14:51,126
A quarrel? With that bookmaker?

1604
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:54,485
I don't know. You get so violent about
the man I can't help thinking that ..

1605
01:14:55,085 --> 01:14:55,757
Hello?

1606
01:14:55,911 --> 01:14:57,352
Let me speak with Mr Bradley.

1607
01:14:57,783 --> 01:14:58,854
Mr Duke Bradley.

1608
01:14:59,436 --> 01:15:00,137
Please.

1609
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,254
Has there been anything between you two?

1610
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,947
You're out of your mind.

1611
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:14,193
Hello? Hello, Duke?

1612
01:15:15,139 --> 01:15:17,542
I'd like to place a bet on Moonray
in tomorrow's Hopeful.

1613
01:15:17,944 --> 01:15:19,314
Did you say Moonray?

1614
01:15:20,662 --> 01:15:23,337
Well, how about me coming out to talk
it over with you? I've nothing to do.

1615
01:15:24,142 --> 01:15:25,719
Sure, I'll be right over. Goodbye.

1616
01:15:29,604 --> 01:15:30,820
Well, cross your fingers.

1617
01:15:31,132 --> 01:15:33,244
Brother Madison?
- Yeah. I thought I'd lost him.

1618
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,870
But he's gone sentimental.
- He's going to back his own nag?

1619
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,501
You know how a sucker goes when
he falls in love with his own horse.

1620
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:40,992
Fritzi, if luck is with me,
this closes my book for good.

1621
01:15:41,592 --> 01:15:42,953
You wouldn't quit the track?

1622
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:43,944
Why not?

1623
01:15:44,905 --> 01:15:46,710
That leaves me a lone gypsy.

1624
01:15:47,355 --> 01:15:48,371
Honey, I love you.

1625
01:15:48,594 --> 01:15:49,896
So long.
- Good luck, Duke.

1626
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,816
How are you, Dixie?
- Hello, Duke.

1627
01:15:53,957 --> 01:15:56,630
Hey listen you little mug. You'd better
give that Dubonnet a ride tomorrow.

1628
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,500
Duke my boy, cracks like that annoy me.

1629
01:15:59,664 --> 01:16:01,068
I wish I had your humility.

1630
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,768
Hello, Mr Bradley.
How are you this evening?

1631
01:16:06,002 --> 01:16:07,759
Fine, fine. What's the matter with you?

1632
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:09,966
Oh, nothing is the matter with me.

1633
01:16:10,918 --> 01:16:12,417
I'm quite alright.

1634
01:16:17,925 --> 01:16:20,896
Give me a brandy, please.
Better make it a double brandy.

1635
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:23,500
Oh, Kiffy. Hello, darling.

1636
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:29,817
Well. It's good to see
you alone for a change.

1637
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,593
Are you going to start that again?

1638
01:16:31,862 --> 01:16:34,895
Yes, but you haven't been alone long.
I just saw your boyfriend leaving.

1639
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:36,745
May I sit down?

1640
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,207
Oh look, darling, are you going
to stop that silly nonsense.

1641
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,281
Well, maybe.

1642
01:16:43,489 --> 01:16:44,997
Kiffy, darling.
- Yes?

1643
01:16:45,774 --> 01:16:47,889
Duke has given me
something to think about.

1644
01:16:49,907 --> 01:16:51,236
He has?
- Yes.

1645
01:16:51,559 --> 01:16:53,161
He may leave the track after tomorrow.

1646
01:16:54,145 --> 01:16:55,575
Yes, that's right. He may.

1647
01:16:56,293 --> 01:16:57,548
What do you mean by that?

1648
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:01,672
Well I mean, that's what you just said.

1649
01:17:02,138 --> 01:17:03,260
Oh, yes.

1650
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,102
He's been in love with
Carol Clayton for a year.

1651
01:17:06,302 --> 01:17:08,176
But he wouldn't ask her
to marry him because ..

1652
01:17:08,308 --> 01:17:11,572
Well, he didn't feel that he could
do as much for her as Madison can.

1653
01:17:11,911 --> 01:17:14,655
But if Duke wins enough money
tomorrow, he's going to tell her.

1654
01:17:16,138 --> 01:17:18,175
He's ..? You mean he's ..?

1655
01:17:18,687 --> 01:17:19,389
Duke?

1656
01:17:21,863 --> 01:17:22,622
Oh.

1657
01:17:23,568 --> 01:17:24,512
Oh, barman.

1658
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,882
Get me another .. double brandy.

1659
01:17:28,378 --> 01:17:29,988
Kiffy, isn't that an awful lot?

1660
01:17:30,182 --> 01:17:31,528
Well, I'm, I'm ..

1661
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:33,902
I am very distressed.

1662
01:17:34,277 --> 01:17:35,494
Oh, darling.

1663
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:37,006
You know.

1664
01:17:37,506 --> 01:17:40,383
Duke has made me realize
how selfish I've been.

1665
01:17:41,266 --> 01:17:44,162
Dubonnet is in the pink and I'm going
to win The Hopeful tomorrow ..

1666
01:17:44,282 --> 01:17:46,315
And have my hour of triumph, but ..

1667
01:17:47,266 --> 01:17:49,436
Win, lose or draw, darling.

1668
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:51,550
I'm going to quit the track for you.

1669
01:17:54,219 --> 01:17:55,615
Muggins, darling.

1670
01:17:56,862 --> 01:17:57,506
I ..

1671
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:58,828
Yes, dear?

1672
01:17:59,404 --> 01:18:01,486
Well, there is something you ought ..

1673
01:18:04,107 --> 01:18:05,147
Well, what is it?

1674
01:18:07,009 --> 01:18:07,820
Darling?

1675
01:18:08,871 --> 01:18:09,675
Hello.

1676
01:18:10,098 --> 01:18:12,418
Oh, I told you.
You shouldn't drink all that.

1677
01:18:12,809 --> 01:18:14,985
Oh, Muggins darling, I've ..

1678
01:18:15,588 --> 01:18:16,896
Done something terrible.

1679
01:18:17,267 --> 01:18:18,854
What is it?
- Oh ..

1680
01:18:21,224 --> 01:18:23,914
Get me another double.
Bring me the bottle.

1681
01:18:24,218 --> 01:18:24,905
Kiffy.

1682
01:18:26,906 --> 01:18:28,881
Please don't be angry with me.

1683
01:18:29,221 --> 01:18:31,004
Well Kiffy, what is it?

1684
01:18:31,778 --> 01:18:34,544
Well .. I've given Miss Clayton.

1685
01:18:34,883 --> 01:18:36,255
Dixie Gordon's contract.

1686
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:38,181
What?
- Yes.

1687
01:18:38,386 --> 01:18:39,680
Isn't that awful?

1688
01:18:40,113 --> 01:18:42,098
He is going to ride Moonray tomorrow.

1689
01:18:57,061 --> 01:18:59,358
Will you get me the Brookvale
Farm, and hurry please.

1690
01:19:00,353 --> 01:19:01,426
Say look, this is ..

1691
01:19:01,566 --> 01:19:03,097
Hello? Hello, Brookvale?

1692
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,869
Has Mr Bradley arrived there?

1693
01:19:05,321 --> 01:19:06,622
No ma'am. He ain't come yet.

1694
01:19:07,373 --> 01:19:09,333
Yes ma'am, I'll tell him
just as soon as he comes.

1695
01:19:11,558 --> 01:19:13,287
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Sam.

1696
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,558
Good evening, Mr Duke.

1697
01:19:14,678 --> 01:19:15,680
Hello Rosetta.

1698
01:19:15,974 --> 01:19:18,514
Mrs Kiffmeyer just phoned and
wants you to phone her right away.

1699
01:19:18,676 --> 01:19:20,779
I'll call her later. Will you
tell Mr Madison I'm here.

1700
01:19:20,983 --> 01:19:22,943
Yes, sir. Go right in the
lobby and I'll tell him.

1701
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:34,139
Evening, Duke.
- Evening, Hartley.

1702
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,392
Nice of you to come out.
- A pleasure. Where's Carol?

1703
01:19:36,664 --> 01:19:39,128
She is busy with our guests.
She asked to be excused.

1704
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:42,157
Do you mind if we get down to cases?
- No, of course not.

1705
01:19:42,538 --> 01:19:45,322
Duke, what price can you give
me on Moonray tomorrow?

1706
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:48,065
Well .. let's see.

1707
01:19:52,151 --> 01:19:54,696
Well, twelve horses in the race .. uh ..

1708
01:19:58,186 --> 01:19:59,802
I think I can give you 2-1, Hartley.

1709
01:20:00,591 --> 01:20:02,379
That's good with me.
- How much do you want?

1710
01:20:03,343 --> 01:20:05,382
You're quite a cigar
smoker, aren't you Duke.

1711
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,230
Yeah, why?
- Oh, nothing.

1712
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:09,913
How much do you want on Moonray?
- Fifty thousand dollars.

1713
01:20:12,943 --> 01:20:13,775
Okay.

1714
01:20:14,117 --> 01:20:15,447
Sure you don't want any more?

1715
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,785
What's the most you could cover, Duke?

1716
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:22,648
Well, let's see. I just figured ..

1717
01:20:25,376 --> 01:20:27,615
You know, this is a
beautiful spot here, Hartley.

1718
01:20:27,831 --> 01:20:30,363
A few thousand dollars would make
it the prettiest place in the world.

1719
01:20:30,665 --> 01:20:32,406
A new barn stocked with thoroughbreds.

1720
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:34,764
I asked you what's the most
you could cover, Duke.

1721
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:39,227
Would you like to make
it a hundred thousand?

1722
01:20:39,628 --> 01:20:42,257
Is that all you can pay off on?
- It's all I want, pal.

1723
01:20:43,007 --> 01:20:43,729
Okay.

1724
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:45,210
Mr Duke.

1725
01:20:45,418 --> 01:20:48,150
Mrs Fritzi Kiffmeyer is on the phone
again and says she's <i>got</i> to talk to you.

1726
01:20:48,352 --> 01:20:50,185
Thanks, Rosetta.
Will you excuse me, Hartley?

1727
01:20:50,305 --> 01:20:50,958
Yeah.

1728
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:53,687
Rosetta.

1729
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:56,870
You've been around Mr Bradley
a good deal, haven't you.

1730
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,109
Oh my yes. All I could.

1731
01:21:00,043 --> 01:21:02,794
He certainly smokes strong
cigars, doesn't he.

1732
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,325
Yes sir, Mr Madison. And he leaves
them around all over the place.

1733
01:21:09,013 --> 01:21:10,722
Yeah. All over the country.

1734
01:21:12,418 --> 01:21:13,523
Did I make a bet?

1735
01:21:15,141 --> 01:21:16,940
The sucker just went for a hundred G's.

1736
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,884
You heard me. A hundred thousand bucks.

1737
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:23,110
What?

1738
01:21:24,035 --> 01:21:24,965
Say that again.

1739
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:28,036
Dixie Gordon is riding Moonray?

1740
01:21:28,521 --> 01:21:30,624
What do you mean? I thought
you had him under contract.

1741
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,557
Oh.

1742
01:21:32,918 --> 01:21:34,667
Oh, Carol arranged the switch, huh?

1743
01:21:36,387 --> 01:21:38,559
Well, it looks like I'll be
leaving Saratoga on a boxcar.

1744
01:21:40,055 --> 01:21:40,899
Call it off?

1745
01:21:41,956 --> 01:21:43,518
No Fritzi, I said yes to the chump.

1746
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:45,676
Yeah. Okay, babe.

1747
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:47,258
I love you.

1748
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:57,060
Well Hartley, I'll be running along.
- Won't you have a drink before you go?

1749
01:21:57,474 --> 01:21:58,363
No thanks.

1750
01:21:58,562 --> 01:22:01,480
I've got to help Fritzi dig up another
jockey to ride Dubonnet tomorrow.

1751
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:02,858
Goodnight.

1752
01:22:03,214 --> 01:22:04,028
Goodnight.

1753
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,440
Tell Carol I took this.

1754
01:22:09,788 --> 01:22:12,281
I may be sitting on a street corner
after The Hopeful tomorrow.

1755
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:28,344
How is he, Medbury?
- Fine. Raised him a half this morning.

1756
01:22:28,464 --> 01:22:30,804
He's a lot of horse today.
They'll have to beat him to win.

1757
01:22:30,924 --> 01:22:31,647
Good.

1758
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:33,546
Dixie. I've got a big bet on this race.

1759
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:35,485
There will be five thousand
extra if you win.

1760
01:22:36,131 --> 01:22:37,981
Well, you can make out
your check right now.

1761
01:22:38,179 --> 01:22:39,478
I hope you lose.

1762
01:22:40,009 --> 01:22:42,476
You double-crossing Newport termite.

1763
01:22:44,128 --> 01:22:45,601
I'll see you after the race, boys.

1764
01:22:46,789 --> 01:22:48,202
Get away from that horse.

1765
01:22:49,793 --> 01:22:50,437
What?

1766
01:22:50,634 --> 01:22:52,222
You heard me. You'll make him nervous.

1767
01:22:52,603 --> 01:22:55,171
I raised him from the
time he was foaled.

1768
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:56,673
And I should make him nervous?

1769
01:22:57,225 --> 01:22:58,660
Get the old buzzard out of here.

1770
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,465
I told you to keep away from that horse.

1771
01:23:00,585 --> 01:23:01,684
You and who else?

1772
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:03,577
Why don't you go home and go to bed?

1773
01:23:04,149 --> 01:23:07,291
Hey, I'll sprinkle flit on you.
- Alright. That's enough.

1774
01:23:08,948 --> 01:23:10,265
What's the matter, grandpa?

1775
01:23:10,795 --> 01:23:11,888
Are you alright?

1776
01:23:12,808 --> 01:23:13,757
What happened?

1777
01:23:14,982 --> 01:23:16,083
I guess he fell down.

1778
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:18,529
Yeah. I fell down alright.

1779
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:20,940
Moonray.

1780
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:23,651
I'm going to bet ten dollars agin you.

1781
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:27,075
I'll see you again, young fellah.

1782
01:23:30,275 --> 01:23:31,749
Hey Duke. Come here.

1783
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:34,277
Hello, grandpa. What's the
matter, pulled a tendon?

1784
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:37,166
No, I bumped into a rat
and pulled up lame.

1785
01:23:37,496 --> 01:23:40,887
Say, did you lay off that big
bet you took on Moonray?

1786
01:23:41,103 --> 01:23:42,747
No, no. All the other books are loaded.

1787
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:45,499
I've been following the
track for sixty years.

1788
01:23:45,849 --> 01:23:49,148
This is the first time I ever pulled
for my own horse to lose.

1789
01:23:50,426 --> 01:23:52,445
Thanks grandpa. If I'm
lucky you'll get your stud.

1790
01:23:53,264 --> 01:23:56,121
You mean my old stud Miracle Lad?
- You bet.

1791
01:23:57,361 --> 01:23:59,178
I'll see you after the race.
- Yeah, alright.

1792
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:00,975
Hey Duke .. Duke.

1793
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:04,574
I can't lay off enough to talk about it.
- Okay. Forget it.

1794
01:24:05,271 --> 01:24:07,491
Your Dubonnet looks fit.
I'll string along with him.

1795
01:24:08,795 --> 01:24:11,801
You've only one horse to be afraid of
and that's Moonray with Dixie Gordon.

1796
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:14,001
Dixie is plenty rough and
he'll win any way he can.

1797
01:24:14,121 --> 01:24:16,382
I found that out in Kentucky.
- Here we go, Hurley.

1798
01:24:16,502 --> 01:24:18,542
Keep your horse clear until
you come to the stretch.

1799
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:20,545
Then pop her a few times.
She'll get you home.

1800
01:24:20,665 --> 01:24:23,026
Thank you Mrs Kiffmeyer for giving
me my chance to come back.

1801
01:24:23,259 --> 01:24:24,859
Hello Duke.
- Hello, Fritzi.

1802
01:24:25,283 --> 01:24:26,920
She looks ready.
- I hope so.

1803
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:30,007
Hello, Fritzi.

1804
01:24:30,734 --> 01:24:31,320
Ha.

1805
01:24:32,251 --> 01:24:33,555
Will you say hello?

1806
01:24:34,057 --> 01:24:36,021
Why sure. Why not? Hello.

1807
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:39,129
Well, I want to take over your losses.

1808
01:24:39,472 --> 01:24:40,287
Who's lost?

1809
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:42,839
Well, you might lose and
I want to protect you.

1810
01:24:44,466 --> 01:24:45,482
Kiffy, I love you.

1811
01:24:45,728 --> 01:24:47,236
Yes. But she doesn't.

1812
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,129
Hey, now wait a minute.

1813
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:50,901
Fritzi.

1814
01:24:51,305 --> 01:24:52,907
You give him a kiss or I will.

1815
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:55,104
Muggins, will ..?
- No.

1816
01:24:55,607 --> 01:24:57,773
You are the most impossible
man in the world.

1817
01:24:58,074 --> 01:25:00,343
I know I am ..
- But Dubonnet had better win.

1818
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:02,746
Oh, heavens.
I've been holding the thought.

1819
01:25:12,915 --> 01:25:13,861
Hello, Hartley.

1820
01:25:13,981 --> 01:25:16,224
Aren't you excited, darling?
- Yes, rather.

1821
01:25:20,468 --> 01:25:22,890
How much have we got on this?
- Enough to give you heart failure.

1822
01:25:29,509 --> 01:25:31,955
Why don't you get back in your
wheelchair Hurley, where you belong.

1823
01:25:32,389 --> 01:25:34,832
Go, get that horse out of here, Gordon.
- Ah, shut up.

1824
01:25:50,068 --> 01:25:52,344
Rocket by a length.
Moonray, second by a half.

1825
01:25:52,655 --> 01:25:53,613
Dubonnet third.

1826
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:59,504
Ah, I can't stand to watch this.
- Then close your eyes.

1827
01:26:09,906 --> 01:26:10,693
How is it?

1828
01:26:11,505 --> 01:26:13,579
Gordon is whipping Moonray.
He's going to pass Rocket.

1829
01:26:13,754 --> 01:26:15,071
Where is Dubonnet?
- Third.

1830
01:26:15,237 --> 01:26:16,453
Come on, Hurley.

1831
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,143
Gordon is giving Moonray a ride alright.

1832
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:25,546
Where's Dubonnet?
- Third.

1833
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:26,760
Oh, my goodness.

1834
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:40,281
Dubonnet is moving up.

1835
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:42,835
He'll not touch Moonray.
Not with Dixie Gordon riding.

1836
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:50,458
Dubonnet is second now.
- That's still not good enough.

1837
01:26:50,636 --> 01:26:51,986
Come on, Gordon.
- Gordon?

1838
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:53,249
I mean Hurley.

1839
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:05,609
Lay up, Gordon.
- You can't get through, Hurley.

1840
01:27:05,903 --> 01:27:07,005
Do you want it again?

1841
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:21,989
Come on.
- Dubonnet.

1842
01:27:48,867 --> 01:27:51,027
Maybe he cut that way because
he was on the outside.

1843
01:27:51,736 --> 01:27:53,833
Boy, that was close.
Who do you think won it, Tip?

1844
01:27:54,798 --> 01:27:56,878
Don't ask me.
- Alright. I won't.

1845
01:27:57,951 --> 01:27:59,396
What is it, Hartley? A dead heat?

1846
01:28:00,035 --> 01:28:01,073
I don't know.

1847
01:28:07,227 --> 01:28:08,984
How about it, judge. Who won?

1848
01:28:09,104 --> 01:28:11,575
I think it's Moonray but we can't
tell until we see the picture.

1849
01:28:11,695 --> 01:28:13,502
Slow motion or still camera?

1850
01:28:13,799 --> 01:28:15,215
Slow motion. It's more accurate.

1851
01:28:15,378 --> 01:28:17,280
Judge, it looked like
Moonray from where I sat.

1852
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,343
You were sitting down
when you trained him.

1853
01:28:19,517 --> 01:28:21,568
Will you leave before I blow you away?

1854
01:28:22,093 --> 01:28:24,276
You know, I got a good mind to slug you.

1855
01:28:25,604 --> 01:28:27,392
How long is it take to
develop the pictures?

1856
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:28,351
17 minutes.

1857
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,999
You'd have saved yourself a lot of
time judge if you'd kept your eyes open.

1858
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:36,456
Hey. Grandpa. What happened?

1859
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:38,825
I think he must have fainted.
- Oh.

1860
01:28:48,004 --> 01:28:49,907
Give me a bicarbonate of soda.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1861
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,189
What's the matter, Fritzi? Nervous?
- Yes.

1862
01:28:53,481 --> 01:28:57,056
I know. A stomach full of butterflies?
- Oh, Duke. They feel like pigeons.

1863
01:28:57,391 --> 01:28:59,315
When you start on that
stuff it's time to quit.

1864
01:28:59,435 --> 01:29:01,373
I'm not getting it for myself.
It's for Carol.

1865
01:29:01,931 --> 01:29:03,066
Carol? Where is she?

1866
01:29:03,347 --> 01:29:05,952
Outside in my box. She knew you
were here. She wouldn't come in.

1867
01:29:06,147 --> 01:29:06,876
Why not?

1868
01:29:07,326 --> 01:29:09,378
I think she's the most
miserable girl in the world.

1869
01:29:09,579 --> 01:29:12,320
Oh. Tell her to get wise to herself.
I'd have done the same thing she did.

1870
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,895
Oh no you wouldn't. And she
knows it. That's what hurts.

1871
01:29:15,463 --> 01:29:19,322
We women can do things to a guy we love
that a man wouldn't do to a rattlesnake.

1872
01:29:19,607 --> 01:29:21,510
Yeah, I know. That's what
makes me feel so good.

1873
01:29:21,816 --> 01:29:23,533
What are you going
to do if Moonray wins?

1874
01:29:23,653 --> 01:29:26,457
Well, I'll be in a pretty tight spot. I
won't be able to buy grandpa that stud.

1875
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:29,210
Or fix up Brookvale or
restock it with thoroughbreds.

1876
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,374
Yeah, that's right.

1877
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,422
Oh Duke, don't feel like that.

1878
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:35,054
Here, you take it to her.
- Oh no, not me.

1879
01:29:35,695 --> 01:29:37,872
Oh, Duke.
- Will you turn off that tremolo.

1880
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:39,002
Oh you fool.

1881
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:41,343
Oh, here you are. Hello Dukey.

1882
01:29:41,463 --> 01:29:43,537
Hello pal. Have a snort?
- Oh, no thanks.

1883
01:29:43,761 --> 01:29:45,692
I'll see you boys in the judge's room.
- Alright.

1884
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,453
Do that again.
- Yes, sir.

1885
01:29:48,336 --> 01:29:51,297
I don't know what I'm going to
do if that Dubonnet doesn't win.

1886
01:29:51,547 --> 01:29:55,468
And you won't be able to fix
up the farm for that lovely lady.

1887
01:29:55,588 --> 01:29:56,988
Brandy, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.

1888
01:29:57,108 --> 01:30:00,185
Here. You need this worse than I do.
- Yes. Well, perhaps I do.

1889
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:03,380
Why hello, Hartley. Looking for someone?
- No.

1890
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,119
You'll find her in the Kiffmeyer box.

1891
01:30:05,577 --> 01:30:06,478
Oh, thank you.

1892
01:30:08,178 --> 01:30:10,024
I don't know. I don't like that man.

1893
01:30:12,049 --> 01:30:13,864
Hey, it's about time.
Let's see the pictures.

1894
01:30:13,984 --> 01:30:15,221
Yes. Well come on.

1895
01:30:15,627 --> 01:30:18,092
What's going to happen if
Dubonnet doesn't win?

1896
01:30:18,285 --> 01:30:20,302
You can give me a job in
one of your beauty parlors.

1897
01:30:20,566 --> 01:30:23,248
Yes, I'll give you one
of the beauty parlors.

1898
01:30:26,402 --> 01:30:28,204
Hurry up, Kiffy. They're ready to start.

1899
01:30:28,324 --> 01:30:30,064
Where shall I sit?
- Right here. Come on.

1900
01:30:30,184 --> 01:30:31,166
Thanks, darling.

1901
01:30:31,286 --> 01:30:33,717
Well, are we ready?
- All set, Mr Boswell. Close the shades.

1902
01:30:33,977 --> 01:30:37,015
Oh Duke, I never wanted to win a
race so much in my life. For all of us.

1903
01:30:37,225 --> 01:30:38,428
Let's have the picture.

1904
01:30:39,451 --> 01:30:41,043
Now which one is that on the rail?

1905
01:30:41,381 --> 01:30:42,339
That's Dubonnet.

1906
01:30:44,861 --> 01:30:47,081
Muggins, I can't stand this much longer.

1907
01:30:48,153 --> 01:30:49,668
Can't they run a little faster?

1908
01:30:50,063 --> 01:30:51,110
I'm dying.

1909
01:30:51,272 --> 01:30:52,737
Well, how do you think I feel?

1910
01:30:53,993 --> 01:30:56,270
Hurley certainly is
giving Dubonnet a ride.

1911
01:30:56,539 --> 01:30:59,783
This is the first time Gordon has
been on the outside in a long time.

1912
01:31:01,221 --> 01:31:02,547
Come on, Dubonnet.

1913
01:31:06,724 --> 01:31:08,650
Dubonnet wins.
- Oh Duke.

1914
01:31:09,123 --> 01:31:10,097
Kiffy, darling.

1915
01:31:12,662 --> 01:31:14,547
How about that stud you promised me?

1916
01:31:14,738 --> 01:31:16,762
Go get him, grandpa.
- Hot dog.

1917
01:31:17,313 --> 01:31:18,715
Did I hear you say 'Dubonnet'?

1918
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:21,677
That was Duke's cigar you
smoked in Miami, wasn't it?

1919
01:31:21,991 --> 01:31:23,160
Yes Hartley, it was.

1920
01:31:24,191 --> 01:31:25,763
You can leave the track now, Duke.

1921
01:31:26,582 --> 01:31:27,283
Fritzi.

1922
01:31:28,475 --> 01:31:29,326
I love you.

1923
