1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:13,305
Get that thing away.
Has that ugly mutt had its shots?

3
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:15,742
Go for the shoes, bad shoes.
Last season's markdowns.

4
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:18,314
Oh, I never.

5
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:20,442
It's okay, sweetie.

6
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:22,484
There's a word for a woman like that.

7
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:25,987
And it's rarely used outside a kennel.

8
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,561
Okay, puppy, five minutes
to shop the first floor. Go.

9
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:47,273
- Here?
That's right.

10
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:51,514
Do you know about that list?

11
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:54,516
No.
- It's like that, but you know, I...

12
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:05,728
Oh, I need some blush.

13
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:07,831
Girl, I gotta be...

14
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:25,616
Complimentary sampler
of our new cream with any $25 purchase.

15
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:27,012
How about you?

16
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:29,153
Would you like to get a facelift in a jar?

17
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:32,313
This is my face, deal with it.

18
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:44,992
Hey, Sylvie.

19
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,571
I'm looking at a woman right now
who should be in my magazine.

20
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,039
"There's a fine line
between an outfit and a getup. "

21
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,475
Heh, heh. Where are you right now?
You're not shopping, are you?

22
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:56,739
Of course, I deserve it.

23
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:58,883
I was in my office at 6 this morning.

24
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,180
I love Saturdays at the office,
no one there to distract me.

25
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:06,017
Hey, shouldn't you be
on your way here right now?

26
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,056
What time is it, anyway?

27
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,784
Mary, what are you doing?

28
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:12,088
Are you having sex?

29
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,694
Would I be on the phone with you?

30
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,697
Don't answer that.

31
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,961
I'm on my way upstairs for a manicure.

32
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:20,729
What time is your little do today?

33
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,602
Oh, for the third time, 12:30, okay?

34
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:25,834
And do not be late, Sylvie,
I need you here.

35
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:28,138
Please, when am I ever late?

36
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,577
- Ha.
- I'll see you 12:30-ish?

37
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:32,649
No, no, no "ish. "

38
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:33,842
No "ish. "

39
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,655
Hi, welcome to Saks.
Would you like to try?

40
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,558
- Hello, Ms. Fowler, how have you been?
- Aretha needs water.

41
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,096
Sparkling or still?

42
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,200
Whatever. She drinks out of the toilet.

43
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,960
Tanya's ready for you, Ms. Fowler.

44
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:56,003
Are you Tanya?
- Yeah, that's me. Have a seat.

45
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:59,135
That's your name?
Or are you really Susie from Brooklyn?

46
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:01,745
If it's a long story, don't tell me,
I'm in a hurry.

47
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:04,040
I was born Eileen,
if you wanna know the truth.

48
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,047
I went to this numerologist who said...

49
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,379
...to change my life,
I should change my name.

50
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:11,681
I was working at Mr. Ronnie's
on Astoria Boulevard. Do you know it?

51
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:14,348
I don't get out to Queens
as much as I'd like.

52
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:17,723
The day I changed my name,
a limousine pulls up in front of the shop.

53
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:20,558
You're never gonna believe
who gets out. Madonna.

54
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:23,667
- I have to be at a luncheon at 1.
- Anyway, I can't believe it.

55
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:26,736
I look at her nails, thinking,
"What kind of butcher did this?"

56
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:29,806
So I gave her a manicure
like she's never had in this life.

57
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:30,999
Switch.

58
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,404
I use my own polish.

59
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:34,238
I mix my own colors. I have a gift.

60
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:37,074
The luncheon's in Connecticut.
That's a whole other state.

61
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:39,513
I put Jungle Red on her.
I'll never forget it.

62
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:43,142
Next thing, Saks is calling me saying
Madonna's raving about my manicure...

63
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:44,379
...and do I want a job.

64
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:47,582
- So you wanna try my Jungle Red?
- Hmm. Not bad.

65
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,728
I put this on one of the girls
behind the perfume counter.

66
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:54,263
She just moved to town, bang,
she's having an affair with a married man.

67
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:57,492
Who isn't? If you can't speed this up,
I'm gonna have to come back.

68
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:59,967
- What's your Wednesday like?
- Oh, I'll check.

69
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:03,835
The married-man thing is tricky, isn't it?
Especially when the guy's well-known.

70
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,772
He's some big hoo-hah on Wall Street.

71
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:09,107
I can never remember that guy's name.
Everybody knows him.

72
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:12,182
Wednesday, Wednesday... Haines.

73
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,477
That's it, something Haines.

74
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:17,121
It wouldn't, by any chance,
be Stephen Haines, would it?

75
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:18,920
Uh, yeah, that's it.

76
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,853
Wednesday, 11 or 2?

77
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:23,551
You know, Wednesday isn't good.

78
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:25,821
I think I'd better get this
taken care of now.

79
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:27,362
Oh, great, okay.

80
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:32,196
So you're telling me that Stephen Haines
is having an affair with a salesgirl?

81
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,429
What do you think that's all about?

82
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:37,598
If you ever saw Crystal Allen,
you wouldn't have to ask.

83
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:49,413
Yes, buzz, buzz, I hear you.

84
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:53,791
I swear to God,
it scares me to come here.

85
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:55,249
I'll be a few minutes.

86
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:58,362
I parked on 78th Street
in front of a vacuum-cleaner store.

87
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,554
Don't let me forget.

88
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:02,791
- Why would you forget?
- I just heard something, Edie.

89
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,026
It was very disturbing.

90
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:06,898
I don't know, I almost rear-ended
somebody on the way here.

91
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,266
April, give Mommy her hat.

92
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,204
May, teach June how to braid
her hair like Mommy taught you.

93
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,640
And, hello,
don't we say hi to Aunt Sylvie?

94
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,439
- Hi, kids.
No way.

95
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,376
I don't want to.

96
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,642
- They love you, they love you.
She scares me.

97
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,342
Dora, I'm getting ready to leave.

98
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,612
I have a splitting headache.
You have aspirin?

99
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:25,949
Sylvie, what did you hear?
Where is my purse?

100
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:27,148
Come here, June.

101
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:30,192
- Wait, what's that supposed to be?
- Oh, I'm painting now.

102
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:33,729
Painting?
Wait, what about the pottery thing?

103
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:35,889
Weren't you taking
some puppet-making class?

104
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,295
Let me tell you something.

105
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:39,403
Weird crowd of people,
the puppet people.

106
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:42,233
I'd go insane living here.
I don't know how Alan does it.

107
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:44,568
Oh, Alan moved out.

108
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,472
Whoa, what?

109
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:47,668
Oh, it's okay.

110
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,007
He's down in a studio
on the eighth floor.

111
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,944
I thought he could use a little space.

112
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:55,575
- Dora!
- Let's just go, I can't focus.

113
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:58,086
Dora?
- Will you drive?

114
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:02,124
Sylvie, whatever you heard,
if it's about anybody we know...

115
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:03,624
...don't tell me, I mean it.

116
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,888
Of course I won't tell you.
It's too personal.

117
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:07,793
It's about someone we know, isn't it?

118
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:09,957
Mrs. Edie,
we're running low on breast milk.

119
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,796
Oh, I have the pump in my bag.

120
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,097
It plugs into the cigarette lighter
in the car.

121
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:15,967
Well, forget it, you're not driving.

122
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:19,167
How are you today, little Miss January?
How are you?

123
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,403
Forget it, let's go.

124
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:44,099
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, sit, stay, lay down.

125
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:47,295
Hey, Maggie, did you remember
to polish the silver for the, uh...?

126
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:48,769
- Lunch?
- Yes, lunch.

127
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,500
- Yeah, yes, ma'am.
Oh, boy.

128
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:52,938
How did it get to be noon?

129
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,376
I have 60 women
on their way here for lunch.

130
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:58,038
I haven't even showered.

131
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:00,480
Did you remember
to pick up my dry-cleaning?

132
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:03,382
Yes, I remembered
to pick up your dry-cleaning.

133
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,022
What is wrong with this picture?

134
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,248
How lovely. Thank you.

135
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:07,857
Okay, dog, clean.

136
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:11,826
Bread, flowers and... Oh.

137
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:15,830
Hey, um, do you know where the thing that
I made with the whatsits around the edge?

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,093
- Bowl with the freesias.
- Yeah, where is that?

139
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:19,497
Right in front of you.

140
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:22,401
Oh, yeah, I think the tortellini
will fit in that.

141
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:24,565
- What do you think, Uta?
- Oh, look at this.

142
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:29,975
The face of the Virgin Mary appeared
on a rag at a car wash in Los Angeles.

143
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:34,016
It's hard to believe that you were born
in a country that hands out the Nobel Prize.

144
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:36,779
That's Sweden.
How many times do I have to tell you?

145
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,252
I'm Danish.

146
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:39,720
Like the pastry.

147
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:43,026
- Mom, what's going on?
- Hey, honey.

148
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:45,458
You're supposed to help me
with my book report.

149
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,359
Oh, my God, I just completely forgot.

150
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,500
- I'm so sorry.
- It's due Monday.

151
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,397
Yes, but today is the luncheon for the park.
I'm co-chair.

152
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,630
Which is more important?
Some piece of grass or my education?

153
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:59,504
Molly, I don't know why you save
these things till the last minute, honestly.

154
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:02,305
- Uta can help you with your book report.
- That's her job.

155
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,004
Nicole Kidman has cellulite.

156
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:05,308
Where? Let me see.

157
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,178
- Oh.
I think they drew that in.

158
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:09,752
Let's do it...
We'll finish it after the lunch.

159
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:12,185
- No, we can't, I have to finish the...
- Sketches.

160
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,756
- Sketches which are late.

161
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:15,859
- Then I've to pick up...
- Airline tickets.

162
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:18,655
Why do you always save these things
for the last minute?

163
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,856
Molly Jane Haines,
is that any way to talk to your mother?

164
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,524
Chocolate macadamia cookies.

165
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:27,531
No, that's like five points.

166
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:30,538
- Since when are you counting calories?
- Since I'm fat.

167
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,732
Since you're fat?

168
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,674
Oh, honey, you're not fat, you're perfect.

169
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:37,679
I'll just do the book report myself.

170
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,415
- Now, go take a shower.
- Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:42,109
She thinks she's fat.

172
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:43,982
Oh, your father called.

173
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:47,886
He wants you to have lunch with him
when you come back from your vacation.

174
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,790
My father wants to have lunch with me?
Don't remember the last time he wanted to.

175
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:54,955
He said it was important.

176
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,226
Oh, Maggie, I think I know
what this is about.

177
00:10:57,402 --> 00:11:00,098
I think he's getting ready
to hand me the business.

178
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:03,206
- Know how long I've been waiting?
- Years, you've been waiting.

179
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:04,534
- Just years.
- Years.

180
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,075
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

181
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:12,639
Oh. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, off, off, off.

182
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,843
Molly, how many times have I told you,
no dogs on the bed?

183
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,784
Lucy, off. Go on.

184
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:20,916
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah.

185
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:23,788
How come you design clothes
you wouldn't be caught dead in?

186
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:25,862
That's what your grandfather
manufactures.

187
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,431
Those are his customers,
but they're not gonna be mine.

188
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,792
What's this?

189
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,098
That is a travel coffee filter.

190
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:42,538
Here they come.
The population of Salem has just dropped.

191
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:45,945
All right, all right,
keep your Wonderbras on.

192
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:48,642
It's just a mess now.
Who knows if it's gonna come out?

193
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,312
- It's a brand-new Lexus.
- It's gonna come out, it's from nature.

194
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,821
Just calm down.

195
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:56,256
She splattered breast milk
all over the dashboard.

196
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:58,725
- Do you have a rag?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, here.

197
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:02,559
Maggie, Maggie, can you please put this
in the refrigerator for me?

198
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,794
I'll put it right next to the 2-percent.

199
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,234
Okay, thank you.

200
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:11,873
Oh, my God.

201
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,874
I can't believe you're here.

202
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:17,378
You know what? I don't know
that I've ever seen you in the daylight.

203
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:19,573
You haven't.

204
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:26,318
Hello, I'm Edie Cohen.

205
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:27,822
Natasha.

206
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:30,859
- Natasha?
- Just Natasha.

207
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:32,493
Oh.

208
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,061
Well, very nice to meet you,
just Natasha.

209
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,228
Natasha's a supermodel.

210
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,762
I hate that word. Do not call me that.

211
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,304
It objectifies me.

212
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:45,305
I'm a person, not an accessory.

213
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,137
Okay, fine. You're not a purse.

214
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:50,543
I'm gonna go and get something to drink.
Don't talk about me.

215
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,249
She just finished anger management.

216
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,513
Well, what does she have
to be angry about?

217
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,554
- She's hungry.
- Oh.

218
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:04,526
When are you just gonna settle down
with someone who's right for you?

219
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,391
Like a man? Please.

220
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:08,930
You know that I accept you
as my gay friend.

221
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,294
Thank you.

222
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:14,404
But all of a sudden, half the world is gay.
Explain that.

223
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:17,040
You just don't understand
how much better it is...

224
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,073
...being in a relationship with a woman.

225
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:21,211
If we're lost, we both ask for directions.

226
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,472
When we watch TV,
we watch one show at a time.

227
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:27,015
Nobody drinks out of the milk carton
or asks you to pull their finger...

228
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:30,518
...or obsesses over their decreasing ability
to piss 30 feet.

229
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:33,282
- And when we have sex...
- Oh, no, my...

230
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,892
- neither one of us wants it
with the lights on.

231
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,220
Are you jealous yet?

232
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:41,229
Hey, you owe me a hundred bucks
to have my car detailed, okay?

233
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,458
And tell me, Dorothy Parker...

234
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:46,831
...how much longer am I gonna have to wait
for your second book, huh?

235
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,063
I'd like to print an excerpt
before I'm dead.

236
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,643
You see, you don't just dash off a book
full of sharply observed, hilarious...

237
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:57,303
<i>...yet deeply intelligent essays,
to quote The New York Times.</i>

238
00:13:57,482 --> 00:14:00,042
Yeah, that was six years ago.
Let's get on with it, huh?

239
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:03,187
She's a little distracted.
Did you see her date?

240
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:08,255
Hm.

241
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:09,723
So is Mary in here?

242
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:13,523
It's just so generous of you to open
your gorgeous home for Central Park.

243
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:16,565
Your mother was chair
of the women's committee for many years.

244
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,794
Yes, and it's very important to her
that I carry on the tradition.

245
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:21,996
- And me, of course.
- Well, of course.

246
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:24,437
I don't know
how you manage things in your life...

247
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,577
...and still make time
for your charitable work.

248
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:29,770
- Oh, well, pharmaceuticals.
- Oh, heh, heh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

249
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,083
There's a champagne buffet
out on the lawn.

250
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,617
Barbara, please help yourself.

251
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:40,218
- Oh, amazing, you're here on time.
- Hey, what do you mean?

252
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,484
I'm always on time.
You're the one who's late.

253
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,991
Will you put that thing away?

254
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,926
So impressive turnout. Congrats.

255
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:50,932
- Well, thanks for opening up your Rolodex.
- Hey, what are best friends for?

256
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:54,536
- What's wrong? Nothing.
- What's wrong? Nothing.

257
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,764
- Why are you asking?
- You looked at me funny.

258
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:59,171
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

259
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:01,243
Yeah, something. Your eyes just shifted.

260
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:04,040
- You're not telling me something.
- I tell you everything.

261
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:06,877
And what's with you,
and your tense shoulders up to your ears?

262
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:09,417
Oh. Okay, I wasn't gonna say anything...

263
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:12,317
...but I think my father's getting ready
to hand me the, uh...

264
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,650
- Business?
- Yes.

265
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:17,352
- Wow. Is that a good thing?
- Of course, yes, it's a great thing.

266
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:19,860
It's a fantastic thing,
it's just a lot to take on.

267
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:22,522
I have to talk to Stephen.
He's not gonna be thrilled.

268
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,635
Stephen, right.
So where is he on a Saturday afternoon?

269
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:28,499
The office, where he has been
almost every day and night...

270
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:31,198
...for the last month,
working on some hedge fund.

271
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:32,834
Hmm.

272
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,309
- Really? Ahem.
- Yeah, but in 24 hours...

273
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:39,609
...we are gonna be sipping cappuccino
at the Piazza San Marco.

274
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:45,988
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine. I'm just kind of hungry.

275
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:48,057
I'll get something to eat.

276
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:49,993
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh.

277
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:51,560
- No, that's okay.
- Lucy.

278
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:06,333
- Take this.
- Oh, no.

279
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,604
You have to.
You can come work for me.

280
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:09,837
- Oh, my.
- Take the card.

281
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:13,381
- No, I won't do it.
- Please take the card, sweetheart. Take it.

282
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,354
No carbohydrates at all, which is fine...

283
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:20,286
...because the human body
does not need them.

284
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,693
- Hey, cute dress.
Thanks.

285
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:25,419
Cool shades.

286
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:27,461
- There you go.
- Thanks.

287
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:29,395
Cheers.

288
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:36,539
Edie, that's a lot of food.
Where are you putting it?

289
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,839
Well, I might as well tell you.

290
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,479
You'll find out soon enough.

291
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:46,712
I'm eating for two.

292
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:49,114
- Aw. For crying out loud, Edie, jeez.
- Oh, my God.

293
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,585
- Don't you ever say no?
- How many kids do you need?

294
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:54,657
- What's happening?
- Edie's knocked up again.

295
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,452
Oof. Ugh.

296
00:16:56,627 --> 00:16:58,219
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

297
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:01,627
- I wanna keep going until I get a boy.
- Don't we have enough of those?

298
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,630
You know what?
You two don't understand.

299
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:06,099
There's absolutely nothing
more thrilling...

300
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,728
...than knowing that you're actually
growing a human being inside of you.

301
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:10,999
Right, Mary?

302
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:14,042
Well, you know,
I was going through some junk...

303
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:17,942
...in the attic the other day,
and I saw this box labeled "jars. "

304
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:19,810
Yes, I am a jar saver.

305
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:24,011
And I open up the box, anyway,
and I look in there, and it's not jars.

306
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,986
It's just a whole pile
of Molly's baby clothes.

307
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:31,424
I just picked up one of those little rompers,
I could just feel the tug on my uterus, so...

308
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:34,531
What are you saying?
You're thinking about having another baby?

309
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:38,931
I don't know, you know. I'd never thought
about having more than one, but lately...

310
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:42,197
Maybe since I know the gate's closing,
I don't know.

311
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:44,774
- What?
- Nothing.

312
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:45,966
Something.

313
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,775
I've gotta pee.

314
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,572
For the 10th time today.

315
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,510
I'll be right back.

316
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,850
- Edie.
- What, uh, are you doing?

317
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:01,150
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but now I have to.

318
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:02,383
Mary is like my sister.

319
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,391
I told you, Sylvie, I don't wanna know.

320
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:05,586
Oh, it's about Mary?

321
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:08,561
- This is in the vault, right?
- Vault.

322
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:12,191
- Stephen is having an affair.
- Oh, my God. How do you know?

323
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,304
The new manicurist at Saks told me.

324
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:17,999
He's fooling around with some woman
who works behind the perfume counter.

325
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,370
- The spritzer girl?
- Yeah, can you believe that?

326
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:23,479
What do you think she sells?
Chanel No. Shit?

327
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:25,707
So, what are you saying?
You wanna tell Mary?

328
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:28,579
Of course not, but she's talking
about having another baby.

329
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:31,347
Oh, this is very dangerous, Sylvie.

330
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:34,582
What if the story isn't true?
How much can you trust a manicurist?

331
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,284
Oh, they know everything.
Manicurists and florists.

332
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:40,396
It's frightening how much information
those people are carrying.

333
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:43,761
I don't think we should say anything.
It could come back to haunt us.

334
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:46,198
- The affair could be over for all we know.
- True.

335
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,998
Besides, I don't know anyone
who's gotten into trouble...

336
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:51,403
...for keeping their mouth shut.

337
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:53,509
I mean, I know things about my friends.

338
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:56,010
And I mean, things.

339
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,977
Me too.

340
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,782
- Cheap hand towels.
- Let's go.

341
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,351
Right.

342
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:06,585
Oh. I forgot to pee.

343
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:12,385
Hey!
- Oh, no.

344
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:15,624
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, everything was wonderful, Mary.

345
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,132
I must have the name of your caterer,
so yummy.

346
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:21,760
Oh. No, I made everything myself. I think
people appreciate the personal touch.

347
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:22,997
You cooked?

348
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:25,369
Oh, Mary, how could you?
What were you thinking?

349
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:27,010
Now we'll all have to do that.

350
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:28,702
And not all of us are you.

351
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:31,775
Anyway, congratulations
on a successful event.

352
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,474
Phone for you. It's him.

353
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:38,853
Bye.
Bye.

354
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,057
Hey, honey, they're almost gone.

355
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:42,817
It's safe to come home.

356
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:45,257
Since we're leaving
in the morning tomorrow...

357
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,693
...let's just eat out, and...

358
00:19:52,503 --> 00:19:54,266
Stephen?

359
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,266
Ste...

360
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,341
Stephen,
it took forever to plan this trip...

361
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,411
...and we both really need a vacation.

362
00:20:02,913 --> 00:20:05,347
Yeah, no, there has to be some way.

363
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:14,681
All right.

364
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,788
Okay, I'll call the travel agent.

365
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:21,261
I guess, uh, Venice will still be there.

366
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:23,466
When are you coming home?

367
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:26,535
Oh, okay, then I won't wait up.

368
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,166
All right, bye.

369
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:37,578
That goddamn office
is sucking the life out of him.

370
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:39,807
- Well, something definitely is.
- Sylvie.

371
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:42,680
Come on.
- We didn't mean to be listening in.

372
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,048
No, no, it's okay.
Thank you so much for coming.

373
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:46,280
It meant a lot to me.

374
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:49,483
Are you gonna be okay?
I would stay, but we carpooled.

375
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,151
I'm so sorry,
I've got the little ones at home.

376
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:55,389
No, no, I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine.

377
00:20:58,068 --> 00:20:59,467
Okay.

378
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,570
Goddamn it.

379
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,274
Ned, you gotta back me on this.

380
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,970
It's time to stop talking down
to our readers.

381
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:13,412
<i>That's the way CACHET
is gonna distinguish itself.</i>

382
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,814
You talk about branding the magazine.

383
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:20,150
How about we become
the thinking woman's fashion book?

384
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:22,451
Bring on the provocative writers.

385
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:25,094
We stop putting little Hollywood twits
on the cover.

386
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:30,100
Yes, I know the twits sell,
but, Ned, you hired me for a reason.

387
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:31,632
Let me do my job.

388
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:34,703
This time next year,
you'll look like a genius.

389
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:38,467
- Mary's on three.
- Uh, Ned, I got Ralph Lauren on the line.

390
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:40,371
I gotta go.

391
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:44,241
So how was lunch with Dad?

392
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:47,609
How does it feel to be head
of your own design house?

393
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:49,810
<i>- He fired me.
What?</i>

394
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:51,147
Yeah, my own father.

395
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:55,554
He said I was spreading myself too thin
and that it showed in my work.

396
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:58,126
Excuse me, but designing
the perfect little frock...

397
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:01,162
...for a woman to wear home
from hip-replacement surgery...

398
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:02,890
...is not exactly my work.

399
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,864
Oh, honey.

400
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:07,595
Come to my office,
the Grey Goose rep was just here.

401
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:10,899
We'll open a bottle and bitch about the men
who don't believe in us.

402
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:12,565
What? Is Ned riding you again?

403
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:14,711
Oh, I mean, that's just absolutely absurd.

404
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,676
That must feel terrible.

405
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:20,749
- Why doesn't he just trust your vision?
- Well, it's a crisis of confidence.

406
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:21,976
I can feel it.

407
00:22:22,152 --> 00:22:25,747
I need to pull a couple of great writers
onto this magazine, and fast.

408
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:28,050
<i>Well, you can do that. Stop at nothing.</i>

409
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,318
I love you, you know that?

410
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:33,622
Whoa. Well, you wouldn't if you saw me.
My hair looks terrible.

411
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:36,664
Could you get me into Saks for a haircut?
Is that okay?

412
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:38,927
Don't go to Saks. They'll butcher you.

413
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,495
Hey! Hey!

414
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:45,369
Wait, what are you talking about?
That woman just did the rudest thing.

415
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,907
Your hair always looks great.

416
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:49,705
<i>- Anyway, love you, mean it, bye.
- Mary.</i>

417
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,438
Mary?

418
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,242
Women.

419
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:06,225
Hello, I'm Mary Haines, and my friend
Sylvie Fowler called ahead for me.

420
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:09,025
Yes, she did.
We can squeeze you in, but not for an hour.

421
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,099
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh.

422
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:12,562
Oh.

423
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:14,761
Well, can I get a manicure while I wait?

424
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:16,133
- Let me check.
- Okay.

425
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:17,899
Let's see.

426
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:20,908
- Okay, Tanya's had a cancellation.
- Great.

427
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:23,546
- First table, straight back.
- Okay, thank you.

428
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:24,772
Oh.

429
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,076
Okay. Tanya?

430
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:36,616
Tanya?

431
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:40,560
- Hi, they told me to come right back here.
- Oh, sure, have a seat.

432
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:43,698
Well, let's have a look.

433
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,831
Oh, my, what have we done
to ourselves?

434
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:47,368
Oh, I retiled my bathroom.

435
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:48,630
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

436
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:50,296
Oh, God.

437
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,801
Oh, I was thinking
about something neutral.

438
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,842
Wanna maybe take a walk
on the wild side?

439
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:58,448
- How about this? Jungle Red.
- That's a little too much for me.

440
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:00,139
How about this? This is nice.

441
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:03,775
French Fawn, whatever. Okay.

442
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:07,684
What's that perfume you're wearing?

443
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:11,350
- Something my husband gave me.
- Oh, where have I smelled that before?

444
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,860
I know. That's the same stuff
that my friend wears.

445
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,022
She works the perfume counter
downstairs.

446
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,224
Expensive stuff.

447
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,335
But she's got expensive taste, that one.

448
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:21,130
- Her name's Crystal Allen.
- Who?

449
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:24,365
My friend at the perfume counter.
That girl needs a man with money.

450
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,009
She's got one now too. Married, though.

451
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:29,236
Narciso Rodriguez is just amazing.

452
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:32,541
The guy she hooked,
his picture's always in the business pages.

453
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:35,685
For Crystal, that's like the classifieds
for a husband.

454
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:38,913
I can never remember that guy's name.
Everyone knows him.

455
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,523
- That's a beautiful ring, by the way.
- Oh, thank you.

456
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,956
On the wrong hand, though.
- It's the right hand.

457
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:46,562
My girlfriends gave it to me.
We gave each other one.

458
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,494
Haines, that's his name. Stephen Haines.

459
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:52,464
I was there when she met him.
Oh, boy, what a performance.

460
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:54,536
This Haines guy walks up
to the counter...

461
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:58,300
...serious type, expensive suit,
good-looking, little thinning on top...

462
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:01,103
...and he says he wants to buy
some perfume for his wife.

463
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,178
"What type of woman is she?"
Crystal says.

464
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:06,544
He says, "The kind that smells like soap. "
Which I thought was sweet.

465
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:08,412
But for Crystal, it was a challenge.

466
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:11,110
So then she says,
"Would you prefer something sexier?"

467
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:13,381
And she runs her eyes up and down him...

468
00:25:13,557 --> 00:25:15,752
...the way a big cat looks
at a slow wildebeest.

469
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:18,690
I felt kind of bad for the guy.
He didn't stand a chance.

470
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:21,729
So then she picks up
the tester bottle of Jezebel...

471
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:23,366
That's the stuff you're wearing.

472
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:26,401
- She sprays it on her wrist and her arm
for him to smell...

473
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,969
...he starts sniffing around.

474
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:30,129
I guess he liked it more than he planned.

475
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:33,105
To tell you the truth,
I think this was a game for Crystal...

476
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:37,008
...until he took out his credit card,
and then she recognized his name.

477
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,239
And then what happened?

478
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:41,407
She really pursued him.
Then they just started seeing each other.

479
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:44,247
He takes her for nice dinners,
buys her clothes...

480
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,888
...sends her flowers in a vase.

481
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:48,923
- You know, the kind you keep.
I don't think that...

482
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:53,595
I don't think that, um...

483
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:55,889
I'm...

484
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:59,593
I just remembered
that I have to go somewhere.

485
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,102
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Was I talking too much again?

486
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:05,969
You know, I just try to entertain my clients
when they're sitting here, Mrs?

487
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:08,043
Haines.

488
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:10,911
Oh, God.

489
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:14,642
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm so, so sorry, I had no idea.

490
00:26:14,818 --> 00:26:17,378
Oh, me and my big mouth.
Is there anything I could do...?

491
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:19,749
No, just stop telling that story. I mean it.

492
00:26:19,923 --> 00:26:24,383
I'll never mention it again.
I promise, I promise, Mrs. Haines.

493
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,487
Donna.

494
00:26:28,065 --> 00:26:30,158
Good dirt. Oh, my God.

495
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,167
Hello, it's Mary for Sylvie again.

496
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:35,567
Is she still in that meeting?

497
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:39,766
Yes, if you could please have her call me
as soon as she gets out. Thank you.

498
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,271
Am I late?

499
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm sorry, Mom.

500
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:48,808
I heard what happened.
Your father is a real shit.

501
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:50,479
I ordered you a gimlet.

502
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:52,622
I know,
you don't drink in the afternoon...

503
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:56,225
...but you will eventually,
so why not start now?

504
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:59,225
You wanna see a bad facelift?

505
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:01,455
Helen Danvers, 2 o'clock.

506
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:05,762
She looks like she's re-entering
the Earth's atmosphere.

507
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,166
Honey, what can I do?
Do you want me to punish Daddy?

508
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:13,605
- Mom, Stephen's having an affair.
- What?

509
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:15,904
I can't believe those words
came out of my mouth.

510
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,446
- That just makes me sick to my stomach.
- Who is she, one of your friends?

511
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:22,380
No, she sells perfume at Saks.

512
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,512
She's a spritzer girl?

513
00:27:24,688 --> 00:27:26,588
I mean, how could I not have known?

514
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:30,124
Three months ago,
he bought cowboy boots.

515
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:36,297
I just can't believe this is happening to me.
I thought we were happy.

516
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,633
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you mean?

517
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:41,965
- I'm gonna tell him to move out.
- Well, that's not very smart.

518
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:43,767
Someone once said...

519
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:46,273
...that when you don't know
what to do, do nothing.

520
00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:51,107
Mom, my husband of 13 years
is having an affair.

521
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:53,545
I mean, do they talk about me
when they're in bed?

522
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:55,014
Do they laugh at me?

523
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:57,676
Please don't tell me to pretend
that nothing happened.

524
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:00,414
You have no idea how this feels.

525
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,926
Well, let me try.

526
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,394
It feels like someone
kicked you in the stomach.

527
00:28:12,236 --> 00:28:14,898
It feels like your heart stopped beating.

528
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,596
It feels like that dream.

529
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:20,470
You know, the one where you're falling
and you want so desperately to wake up...

530
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:24,045
...before you hit the ground,
but it's all out of your control.

531
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:26,713
You can't trust anything anymore.

532
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:29,511
No one is who they say they are.

533
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:31,278
Your life is changed forever.

534
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:36,188
And the only thing to come out
of the whole ugly experience...

535
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,354
...is no one will ever be able
to break your heart like that again.

536
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,194
I can't believe you never told me that.

537
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:49,132
I wanted you to love your father.

538
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,502
Jeez, I mean, who was she?

539
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,841
Some little skank who sold fabric.

540
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:58,738
I met her once.

541
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:03,113
She wore too much makeup
and her bra straps were always showing.

542
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:06,347
- What did you do when you found out?
- Nothing.

543
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:07,785
Nothing?

544
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,892
I had a smart mother too.

545
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,621
Mary, that girl does not mean
anything more to Stephen...

546
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:17,494
...than the fabric whore
meant to your father.

547
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:20,501
If he loved her, believe me,
you would have felt it.

548
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:23,970
I can't fake it, Mom.
I can't be anywhere near him right now.

549
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,507
Then this is what I think we should do.

550
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:30,135
It's spring break.
We'll go away for a couple of weeks.

551
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:33,010
There is nothing like a heavy dose
of a man's mistress...

552
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:35,083
...to make him miss his wife.

553
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:38,847
What do you think this is,
some kind of 1930s movie?

554
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:40,348
That's ridiculous.

555
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:42,553
Can I remind you of something?

556
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:45,422
You have a daughter, just like I did.

557
00:29:45,595 --> 00:29:47,495
This is not just about you.

558
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:49,256
Call Stephen.

559
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:52,698
Tell him I invited you and Molly
up to the cottage in Maine.

560
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,630
We'll leave tomorrow.

561
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:58,832
And I wouldn't discuss this
with any of your friends.

562
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:02,240
They'll all want to help,
and before you know it...

563
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:05,711
...you'll be taking care of them
instead of yourself.

564
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:09,680
Oh, my God.

565
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:11,787
I'm so sorry for you, baby.

566
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:16,349
But it's nice to know
you still need your mama.

567
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:24,189
Was that a sunrise we just saw?

568
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:26,359
Because I'm on the wrong side
of that thing.

569
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:27,594
Alex, stop complaining.

570
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:31,366
I just thought Mary could use a few pals
to take her to the airport.

571
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:33,836
You know why I don't
cultivate friendships?

572
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,535
So I don't have to take anyone
to the airport.

573
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:39,307
<i>At the next intersection, make a left turn.</i>

574
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:42,281
- Who the hell was that?
- The navigation lady.

575
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:46,218
She's always calm. She never talks back.
My husband's in love with her.

576
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:54,993
All right, I'm sensing something here.

577
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:56,427
Something's not being said.

578
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,569
- What's going on that I don't know about?
- Nothing's going on.

579
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,067
What would make you say that?

580
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,570
Alex, what is your take
on Mary and Stephen's marriage?

581
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,572
Um...

582
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:09,871
It looks perfect on the outside...

583
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:12,378
...but there's definitely something
going on there.

584
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,813
You know Mary doesn't like
looking at the cracks.

585
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:17,112
She's too busy filling them.

586
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:19,482
Our girl is all blue sky.

587
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:21,886
But sooner or later...

588
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:24,585
Why?

589
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,529
Mary doing somebody? Heh, heh.

590
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:29,889
- What makes you think it's Mary?
Edie.

591
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:34,059
- Is Stephen having an affair on Mary?
- Oh, for God's sake, Edie.

592
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:36,603
- What a mouth.
- I didn't say anything!

593
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:37,933
Is it somebody we know?

594
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:40,300
- Vault?
- Vault.

595
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:43,540
- Spritzer girl, Saks.
- No.

596
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:47,540
- Oh, my God, how's she taking it?
- Oh, she doesn't know.

597
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:49,909
What do you mean, she doesn't know?

598
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:51,417
What is wrong with you two?

599
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:54,386
We're in the vault, she's not?
Drag her ass into the vault.

600
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,016
Look, I have been struggling
with this for days, okay?

601
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:00,663
Mary and I have been best friends
since college.

602
00:32:01,064 --> 00:32:03,828
- I think she should be told.
- Uh, yeah.

603
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,558
Or we just don't say anything.

604
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:09,200
Sylvie, Mary has to know, okay?

605
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:11,806
Now, that's the right thing to do.

606
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:13,867
You want me to tell her?

607
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:15,443
Because I'll tell her.

608
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:17,807
I don't have a problem with it.

609
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:26,979
Hi.
Hi, I could've taken a cab.

610
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:29,955
No, no, I know you sent, you know,
Molly to be with your mom.

611
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:32,594
And why should you
go to the airport alone?

612
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:35,162
All right, so you have all
the numbers at the house.

613
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:36,356
All the information.

614
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:39,696
- Oh, will you call the vet please, Dr?
- I will, Dr. Jones.

615
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,202
Oh, and the guy from the place
is coming to fix the...

616
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:44,340
- The sink, at 2.
Next week, Tuesday at 2.

617
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:47,306
- Okay.
That too.

618
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:50,270
Oh, hi.
- Hey.

619
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:52,711
What are you guys doing here?
- Just get in, okay?

620
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:56,080
- Come on, get in.
- No, let's get out.

621
00:32:58,355 --> 00:33:04,225
Mary, there's a reason
why we are all here with you today.

622
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:08,430
Sylvie has something
she wants to talk to you about.

623
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,501
This is really hard, Mary, okay? L...

624
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,695
Oh, is this about the perfume bitch?

625
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:21,135
You knew and you didn't tell me?

626
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:23,711
Right now, honest to God,
Mary, I'm so hurt.

627
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,313
- You?
- Yeah.

628
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:27,916
This isn't happening to you,
this is happening to me.

629
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:30,075
I was trying to figure out how to tell you.

630
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:32,778
I'm not saying I didn't...
How can you not tell me?

631
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:34,781
All right, all right, all right!

632
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,084
It's out in the open, okay?

633
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:41,458
Fine, what I wanna know is,
what did he say when you confronted him?

634
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:45,059
I didn't confront him.
He doesn't know I know.

635
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:47,527
- What do you mean?
- Mary, that is ridiculous.

636
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:48,728
I'm not proud of it.

637
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:49,929
What are you saying?

638
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:51,733
He's supposed to know that you know.

639
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:57,410
Okay, okay! All right, I appreciate
all of you trying to help, I really do.

640
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:01,142
But please, don't dissect and analyze
every square inch of this right now.

641
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:02,342
I can't take it.

642
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,317
Just be there for me silently.

643
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:09,116
Okay, let's go.

644
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:13,152
I should not be operating
heavy machinery right now.

645
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:23,500
- Hey, Mom?
- Mm-hm.

646
00:34:24,007 --> 00:34:26,976
- You know what'd be really cool?
- What?

647
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:29,441
If you and I
got mother-and-daughter tattoos.

648
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:32,472
Nice try.

649
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:35,140
Come on,
it would change your whole image.

650
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:37,115
What's wrong with my image?

651
00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:39,380
Never mind.

652
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:42,589
So I can still get
the tattoo, though, right?

653
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:45,990
Yeah, right after I get my nose pierced.

654
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:48,221
How come you never just hear me?

655
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:49,922
I hear you, honey, I hear you.

656
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,160
You want a tattoo,
and you're not getting one.

657
00:34:55,538 --> 00:34:56,937
I'm gonna go watch television.

658
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:59,234
Oh, Mol. Molly, come on,
stay out here with us.

659
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:00,433
It's a gorgeous day.

660
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,738
Is there anything I'm allowed to do?

661
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:09,310
You know, Mom, I think
it's gonna be warm enough this afternoon...

662
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,215
...to go for a swim.

663
00:35:11,388 --> 00:35:13,652
I'll have to put on a bathing suit.

664
00:35:13,823 --> 00:35:18,851
Men, they can just parade around
without a care in the world.

665
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:21,793
At what age do women
start covering themselves with tarps...

666
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:24,092
...just for a stroll on the beach?

667
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:29,733
- Oh, it's Stephen.
- Don't answer it.

668
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:33,933
Let him think you're doing something
incredibly interesting without him.

669
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,772
God, I hate the game-playing.

670
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:40,043
- It does feel good to get some control.
- Of course it does.

671
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,050
He's called three times a day
since we've been here.

672
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,779
He's practically begging you
to come home.

673
00:35:45,955 --> 00:35:47,980
You can see where his heart is.

674
00:35:48,158 --> 00:35:51,525
This would be so much easier
if I didn't love him.

675
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:55,187
There should be a pill that you can take
to make love go away.

676
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:57,458
Why would you wanna
make love go away?

677
00:35:57,634 --> 00:36:00,364
It's hard enough to find it
in the first place.

678
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:03,633
It's Stephen.

679
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:06,469
All right, you can answer it now.

680
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:10,471
Hello? Oh, Stephen.

681
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:14,808
I'm dying to see what she looks like.

682
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:17,851
Okay, listen, Sylvie,
I'm just gonna put it on the record.

683
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:21,047
This is a bad idea.
We don't have a plan, you don't know...

684
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:23,920
- Oh, my God, would you look at that bag?
- So pretty.

685
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,562
Sylvie, I need an advance.

686
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,254
I am not going to enable you.

687
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:30,331
Finish your damn book.

688
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,899
Can I have this bag, Mommy?

689
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:34,502
Mommy, I'm tired of shopping.

690
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:37,003
Can we go? I wanna go.

691
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:38,299
We can't go.

692
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:41,536
Aunt Sylvie is stalking somebody.

693
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,508
When she's finished, we can leave.

694
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,639
I hate this store!

695
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:49,248
April?

696
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:52,811
I want you to listen to me.

697
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:54,854
I'm gonna say something
very important...

698
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:58,323
...and I want you to remember it
for the rest of your life.

699
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:01,020
Nobody hates Saks.

700
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,499
Now, let's do what we came here for.

701
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:09,899
Mommy, can we get something to eat?

702
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:11,404
Fragrances, this is Pat.

703
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:13,201
- She's with a customer.
I'm hungry.

704
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:15,571
- Can we eat somewhere soon, Mommy?
- Oh.

705
00:37:15,745 --> 00:37:18,077
I'm starving.

706
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:19,977
Crystal.

707
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:22,679
Phone for you.

708
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:26,284
It's a guy.

709
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:33,920
Wow.

710
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,933
- She is fine.
- Oh, Jesus, Alex, not now.

711
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:44,096
- We've seen her, now let's get out of here.
- Not on your life.

712
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:45,832
Yeah, I'm with Sylvie.

713
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:50,302
Hello?

714
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:52,309
Stephen.

715
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:55,246
I was hoping it was you.

716
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:58,945
How have you been, baby?
I missed you this week.

717
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:02,417
Well, it's cruel and unusual punishment
to be without you this long.

718
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,385
I say we make up for lost time.

719
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:08,429
What if I cook us
a romantic dinner tonight?

720
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:11,931
The big white square thing with the fire
coming out of it is the stove.

721
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:14,001
Shh. Oh.

722
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,501
No, baby, of course.

723
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:17,765
No, no, no, your work comes first.

724
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:19,374
Don't worry.

725
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:22,375
I'll just save you a piece of cake
with a candle on it.

726
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:23,841
- Phew.
- Huh.

727
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:27,346
Oh, I didn't wanna tell you,
because I didn't want you to make a fuss...

728
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:30,543
...and I'll have other birthdays.

729
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,015
I would... No, no, no.

730
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:36,420
I would feel terrible taking you away
from important business.

731
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:38,288
Are you sure?

732
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:40,861
Oh, baby, I am one happy girl.

733
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,056
Okay, I'll see you at 8.
You know where. Mwah.

734
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:47,298
That stupid wife.

735
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:51,537
Ever since she's been gone to wherever,
he's been acting like a lost puppy.

736
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:55,200
I have an audition at 4:00.
Apparently now I'm cooking dinner.

737
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:57,039
How did this all happen?

738
00:38:57,213 --> 00:38:59,875
You volunteered.
Oh, sorry, Pat, but I gotta go.

739
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:03,075
Can you find something to do tonight
so we can have the apartment?

740
00:39:03,453 --> 00:39:06,513
Fine. And good luck on your audition.

741
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:09,920
Uh, excuse me.
Can I get some help, please?

742
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:14,029
- I was just leaving, but Pat can help you.
- Oh, I was told to ask for Crystal Allen.

743
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:15,255
Ow, give me that.
Oh, no, no.

744
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:17,399
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

745
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,559
I've heard you have a special way
of knowing what a customer needs.

746
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:22,938
Really? And where would you hear that?

747
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,502
- Around.
Pretty.

748
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:28,906
I've been wearing Chanel No. 5
since my christening.

749
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,180
I'm thinking of changing.
What would you suggest?

750
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:35,112
Hmm. Probably nothing too subtle.

751
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:38,618
You're right about that.

752
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:40,983
You always know exactly
where you stand with me.

753
00:39:41,157 --> 00:39:44,718
No, I want a perfume
to be a reflection of my personality.

754
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:49,991
Smart, fearless, clever, loyal...

755
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:53,067
...protective of friends,
ruthless if crossed.

756
00:39:53,236 --> 00:39:54,726
I want that.

757
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:57,868
You shopping for a perfume
or writing a personal ad? Ha, ha, ha.

758
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:00,408
A friend of mine
is wearing something new.

759
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:03,841
Her husband bought it for her here,
I think.

760
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:08,575
Edie, what's the name of that perfume
that Mary Haines is wearing?

761
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:10,616
- You know, the one Stephen bought for her.
- Ah.

762
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:11,947
Stephen Haines.

763
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:13,554
Maybe you waited on him.

764
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:16,453
He's good-looking, receding hairline.

765
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:17,888
Platinum card.

766
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:20,291
Maybe that rings a bell.

767
00:40:20,463 --> 00:40:24,263
Oh, we know you're screwing Stephen,
and Mary is a friend of ours, so you stop it.

768
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:26,493
- Just stop it!
- Shh.

769
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:38,942
So he cheated on you,
and still you said nothing to him?

770
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:41,106
This is not modern, Mary.

771
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:45,220
Ever since I got back from Maine,
it's all flowers and foot rubs...

772
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:47,151
...and, "What can I do for you today?"

773
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:50,486
I mean, maybe my mother is right.
Maybe the affair was no big deal.

774
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,458
Maybe treating it that way
actually is the more modern thing.

775
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:56,189
- When did you become French?
- I'm not sleeping with him.

776
00:40:56,366 --> 00:41:00,496
- Good. Make him suffer.
- Sylvie, let's stop talking about me, okay?

777
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,797
- How's everything with Gary?
- Oh, it's over.

778
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:05,236
He pressed his jeans.

779
00:41:08,244 --> 00:41:09,973
- You are too choosy.
- No.

780
00:41:10,146 --> 00:41:12,410
Yeah, and you know why that is?

781
00:41:12,582 --> 00:41:13,674
You're afraid to choose.

782
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,875
- No, I am not.
- Yes, yes, you are.

783
00:41:16,052 --> 00:41:19,783
Excuse me, I chose once, remember?

784
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:22,288
It was all very nice
until my career took off.

785
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,982
"Sylvie, I'm happy for you. "

786
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,219
He said, "I want you to fly.

787
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:30,025
I just don't think I can be with a woman
who has that kind of wingspan. "

788
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,531
- That was just him.
- Excuse me, no.

789
00:41:32,702 --> 00:41:36,160
I'm sorry, men have a hard time
being with a successful woman.

790
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:38,307
So we shrink to fit, like you.

791
00:41:38,474 --> 00:41:41,841
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, like you were gonna be Donna Karan.

792
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:45,071
And then you put on the brakes
because you could eclipse Stephen.

793
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:48,809
When you fall in love, you don't think
about how it's gonna work out, Sylvie.

794
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:51,180
- You just go with your gut.
- Oh, please.

795
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:54,414
Like my first date with Stephen,
when he gave me that pumpkin.

796
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,353
Thank God it was Halloween.

797
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:59,984
That was an irresistible thing,
to be given a pumpkin on your first date.

798
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:02,324
- That's weird.
It was charming, you know.

799
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:04,466
Carving a pumpkin?
- We carved it together.

800
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:07,102
We were a really good team.
You know, 13 years.

801
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,830
Good afternoon, La Perla.
- Thirteen pumpkins.

802
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:12,634
That is what you think about
when it's all falling apart.

803
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:14,743
It's the pumpkin. The pumpkin matters.

804
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,436
I hate Halloween.
All those strangers at the door.

805
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:21,481
You know, someday, when you are not
looking and you're not thinking, Sylvie...

806
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:24,142
...you're gonna meet the man
you wanna marry.

807
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,810
I'm the man I wanna marry.

808
00:42:25,988 --> 00:42:27,956
That's the problem.

809
00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:29,716
Ooh, hey.

810
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:31,484
Sylvie, what do you think of this?

811
00:42:31,661 --> 00:42:32,753
- On you?
- Yeah.

812
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:34,863
- Really?
- Yeah.

813
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:37,365
Stephen might get lucky tonight.

814
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:40,093
Mrs. Haines, it's been a while
since we've seen you.

815
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:41,702
Time for a new robe?

816
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:44,271
Hello, Grace. I'd like to try this on.

817
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,806
- Really?
- What is everyone's deal?

818
00:42:46,976 --> 00:42:49,274
- What?
I think this is your size.

819
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:53,438
All right, I admit that I underestimated
the value of the slut factor in the bedroom.

820
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:56,551
Great. Maybe he'll leave some cash
on the nightstand.

821
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:01,523
Oh, I just don't understand
why they put fluorescent lighting...

822
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:02,749
...in dressing rooms.

823
00:43:02,925 --> 00:43:05,723
Why would a woman buy anything
if it looks like her thighs...

824
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:07,624
...were hit by a meteor shower?

825
00:43:07,797 --> 00:43:09,560
How are you doing in there, Ms. Allen?

826
00:43:09,732 --> 00:43:12,530
- Do you need another size, another color?
Oh, no, I like it.

827
00:43:12,702 --> 00:43:14,533
Don't go too far. I'm gonna need you.

828
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:16,302
No problem, Ms. Allen.

829
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:19,032
Okay, wow, is this just too much?
I mean...

830
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:22,473
No, it's... I think I'll go out,
and just get some other options, huh?

831
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:24,840
Is there a mirror with better light?
- Yes.

832
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:27,812
Out here in the hall.
But you probably don't wanna go...

833
00:43:27,984 --> 00:43:30,145
I'm not shy.

834
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:37,723
Hmm.

835
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:42,120
I've got to say, you're my first customer
who's had the courage to try that on.

836
00:43:42,298 --> 00:43:43,765
Do you have those cutlet things?

837
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:46,026
- You know, I need some lift.
- Oh, yeah.

838
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:49,433
I think I have to take this.
How much money is it?

839
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:51,095
It's Italian handmade lace.

840
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:54,175
That's why it's $650.

841
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:57,005
Does it come in any other colors?
- Champagne.

842
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,206
Ah. I love champagne.
I'll take it in a champagne as well.

843
00:44:00,783 --> 00:44:03,274
Will that be cash or charge?

844
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:04,612
You take personal checks?

845
00:44:04,787 --> 00:44:07,051
No, but I'd be happy
to open up a store charge.

846
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:10,158
It only takes a few minutes
to do a credit check.

847
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:12,226
Credit check.

848
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:15,057
I don't have time for a credit check.

849
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,667
Hey, what if I gave you the number
of someone who does have a credit card?

850
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:21,769
And I'm sure if you called him,
he'd be happy to give it to you.

851
00:44:21,938 --> 00:44:23,064
We can try that.

852
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:27,141
- What's the gentleman's name?
- Stephen Haines.

853
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:30,205
He's a friend of the family.

854
00:44:30,947 --> 00:44:32,972
Mrs. Haines is a client of ours.

855
00:44:33,149 --> 00:44:37,449
In fact, she's in the dressing room
right across the hall.

856
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:41,250
Would you like me
to have her approve this for you?

857
00:44:44,227 --> 00:44:45,489
No.

858
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:47,856
No, no, no.

859
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,090
Um, you see, I don't think
that would be in very good taste.

860
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:54,828
You see, I'm relatively new in town,
and I haven't had the pleasure...

861
00:44:55,004 --> 00:44:56,403
...of meeting Mrs. Haines yet.

862
00:44:56,572 --> 00:45:00,702
I would hate for this
to be our first introduction.

863
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:02,343
I'm sure you understand.

864
00:45:02,878 --> 00:45:05,005
I do understand.

865
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:08,482
- I'll phone Mr. Haines.
- Thanks, sweetie.

866
00:45:19,195 --> 00:45:21,322
Oh. You don't think it's flattering?

867
00:45:21,497 --> 00:45:23,590
- Is that what you're thinking?
- Mary.

868
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:27,058
She's here,
in the dressing room across the hall.

869
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,067
Crystal Allen.

870
00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:30,603
What?

871
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:34,166
- How do you know?
- I saw her talking to the saleswoman.

872
00:45:34,343 --> 00:45:38,109
She's spending a fortune, and, Mary,
she's putting it on Stephen's account.

873
00:45:38,514 --> 00:45:39,538
Oh, that's not true.

874
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:42,946
If he's paying her bills, Mary,
it means he's still involved with her.

875
00:45:43,386 --> 00:45:47,948
Well, I'm just gonna go home.
Can you just help me out?

876
00:45:48,124 --> 00:45:49,591
Are you leaving?
- Help me off...

877
00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:52,592
Mary, go in there.
- Help me off with this thing.

878
00:45:52,762 --> 00:45:54,889
You've been running away
from this whole thing.

879
00:45:55,264 --> 00:45:58,700
- What are you afraid of?
- Of being made a bigger fool, Sylvie.

880
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:02,827
Listen to me, that woman is working
her way into another person's life...

881
00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:04,404
...and it happens to be yours.

882
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:07,406
And if you don't stand up to her
and face her...

883
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:11,273
...it's a matter of time before she's
carving the pumpkin with your daughter.

884
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:13,915
Now, I'm giving you permission
to behave badly.

885
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:16,551
You go in there and kick her ass.

886
00:46:19,455 --> 00:46:20,717
- Go on.
- Okay.

887
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,518
- I'll be your cornerman, you just go.
- Go.

888
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:28,691
Go.

889
00:46:28,864 --> 00:46:30,331
Go on.

890
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,931
- You can do it.
- Okay, I can't.

891
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:35,127
- Go.
- I can't do it.

892
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:40,002
Oh, shit.

893
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:41,666
- Excuse me?
- Are you kidding me?

894
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:44,005
- Excuse me?
- Are you...?

895
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,915
I'm Mary Haines.

896
00:46:51,954 --> 00:46:53,478
Right, um.

897
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:55,780
Well, this is awkward.

898
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:58,358
- I guess he finally told you.
- No, no, no.

899
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,791
He never mentioned you,
but I've known about you.

900
00:47:00,963 --> 00:47:02,123
- Really?
- Yeah.

901
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:05,358
- I'm surprised I haven't heard from you.
- Well, it's not my style.

902
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:09,129
But since you were in the vicinity,
I thought I'd introduce myself.

903
00:47:09,305 --> 00:47:13,105
Um, look, Mrs. Haines, I am really sorry
for what this has done to you.

904
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:15,505
And I know Stephen
never meant to hurt you.

905
00:47:15,678 --> 00:47:17,942
What? You don't know anything
about my husband.

906
00:47:19,482 --> 00:47:22,610
I do know that a woman never steals
another woman's husband.

907
00:47:22,785 --> 00:47:24,047
They usually go willingly.

908
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,815
Well, it sounds like you have
a lot of experience in that area.

909
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:31,157
You know, Stephen is a very smart man.

910
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,990
He's just way too smart
to take someone like you seriously.

911
00:47:35,164 --> 00:47:36,256
I mean...

912
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:40,729
Mrs. Haines,
I know so many women like you.

913
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:43,337
You have your fancy friends
and your nice houses...

914
00:47:43,506 --> 00:47:47,806
...your calendars are full of social events
and shopping dates and charity lunches...

915
00:47:47,977 --> 00:47:50,912
...to make you feel like you're
doing something with your lives.

916
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,516
But eventually,
you stop paying attention to your men.

917
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:56,082
They get lonely.

918
00:47:56,252 --> 00:48:02,088
And they come looking for someone
who makes them feel appreciated again.

919
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:06,991
And believe me,
they take that very, very seriously.

920
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:09,421
You know, I came in here with...

921
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:13,796
...I admit, just a ridiculous idea
that if you and I ever met...

922
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:16,699
...and you saw
that I was an actual human being...

923
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:19,705
...and not just some stray thought
out in Connecticut...

924
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:22,571
...that you might actually feel
a little bit of remorse.

925
00:48:22,745 --> 00:48:26,545
One woman having that transcendent
moment of connect with another.

926
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:30,708
And that you might realize the scope
of the damage that you've done...

927
00:48:30,886 --> 00:48:33,855
...not just to me, but to a family.

928
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,519
I have no idea what you just said.

929
00:48:36,892 --> 00:48:40,384
I know, yeah. So I'm gonna put this
in terms that you can understand.

930
00:48:40,563 --> 00:48:43,862
You are gonna stop seeing my husband.

931
00:48:44,033 --> 00:48:46,593
I guess that's up to him, isn't it?

932
00:48:48,037 --> 00:48:50,130
Listen, let me give you
a little bit of a tip.

933
00:48:50,306 --> 00:48:52,171
Stephen...

934
00:48:52,575 --> 00:48:58,309
Stephen would never like anything
that, uh, trashy.

935
00:48:58,481 --> 00:49:03,475
Well, if Stephen doesn't like
anything I'm wearing, I take it off.

936
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,883
You were great, Mary.

937
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,652
Get me out of here.

938
00:49:12,928 --> 00:49:14,190
Who are you, Stephen?

939
00:49:14,363 --> 00:49:17,264
- Tell me, what's going on?
- Oh, she is really giving it to him.

940
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,867
And he is not saying much,
because, really, I mean...

941
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:23,471
...what could this cheating,
lying bastard say?

942
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:24,663
What else? What else?

943
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,241
Oh, so they argue some more,
and then Mary gets very quiet...

944
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,210
...and she says,
"Stephen, do you wanna be with her?"

945
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:33,473
- Oh, good move.
- Yeah.

946
00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:34,673
Force his hand.

947
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,478
And he says, "Mary, I love you. "

948
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:41,316
Oh, yeah. Oh, please, predictable.

949
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,924
But I think Mary started listening to him.

950
00:49:44,093 --> 00:49:45,560
So he keeps talking.

951
00:49:45,728 --> 00:49:49,494
He says he never meant
for the affair to turn into anything.

952
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:53,294
And he tried to end it more than once.

953
00:49:53,469 --> 00:49:57,132
Men get themselves into things,
then they don't know how to get out of it.

954
00:49:57,306 --> 00:49:59,536
But here's
where he makes his big mistake.

955
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:05,278
He says he kept seeing Crystal
because he felt she got dependent on him.

956
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:07,938
- And that he didn't wanna hurt her.
- Hurt her?

957
00:50:08,117 --> 00:50:11,518
That's exactly what Mary said,
then she makes her big mistake.

958
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:14,952
She says, "How could you not see
that she's just after your money?"

959
00:50:15,124 --> 00:50:16,148
Oh, she blew it.

960
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:20,227
The last thing a man wants to hear is that
his wife is the only one stupid enough...

961
00:50:20,396 --> 00:50:22,660
...to love him for himself.

962
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:25,028
Nobody knows how to argue.

963
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,667
I should run a school.

964
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:29,633
So now he asks her the big question.

965
00:50:29,805 --> 00:50:32,433
Is there any way they can put it all
back together again?

966
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:35,572
You should have heard him.
It would have broke your heart.

967
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:36,904
Oh, who cares?

968
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,104
Do we still have jobs or not?

969
00:50:39,281 --> 00:50:42,045
Mary said she wants a divorce.

970
00:50:42,985 --> 00:50:44,850
- What did he say?
- He says...

971
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,420
...he'd wish she'd take some time
and think it over.

972
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,649
And that he would spend
the night at a hotel.

973
00:50:49,825 --> 00:50:53,022
- What did she say?
- She threw her wedding band at him.

974
00:50:53,696 --> 00:50:55,027
Oh, that's bad.

975
00:50:55,197 --> 00:50:58,223
- Oh, that's very bad.
- Yeah.

976
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:02,228
Where the hell's my address book?

977
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:05,373
I have a woman who keeps offering me
a job. Barbara somebody.

978
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:08,374
What are you doing?
You can't desert them now.

979
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:11,940
Oh, my God. Shh.
I hear something.

980
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:18,843
That's it.

981
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:20,648
We're on a sinking ship, Uta.

982
00:51:21,857 --> 00:51:23,381
I have a cardinal rule.

983
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:27,655
Never get attached to the family.
This is exactly why.

984
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:32,893
And that, Uta, is why the revolutionaries
threw tea into Boston Harbor.

985
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:36,401
I need to eat something.
That's low-fat, low-carb, fat-free...

986
00:51:36,572 --> 00:51:38,164
There's fruit everywhere.

987
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,433
- Where's the junk?
- You don't let me buy any.

988
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:42,941
Why don't I fix you a drink?

989
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,503
All right.

990
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:49,014
I think you both should know
Stephen and I are splitting up.

991
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:51,509
Yeah, he's been having an affair.

992
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:53,416
- Get out of here.
- I don't believe it.

993
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:55,113
Yeah, yeah.

994
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:57,758
And let me tell you
how stupid I am, okay?

995
00:51:57,926 --> 00:52:00,827
I had myself convinced
that it was no big deal.

996
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,964
Just a little chapter, not the whole book.

997
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:06,067
And if I just put the old blinders on,
rose above it...

998
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:08,328
...everything would work itself out.

999
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:09,732
Bullshit.

1000
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:13,197
I mean, it's not like I was deliriously happy
every single day...

1001
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,468
...of this marriage, you know?

1002
00:52:15,678 --> 00:52:17,908
But did I screw around? No.

1003
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:20,171
I could have, by the way.

1004
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:23,648
I really could have
because men have come on to me plenty.

1005
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,047
All right, once or twice.

1006
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,155
But I thought about it,
because this just in:

1007
00:52:28,323 --> 00:52:34,785
Thirteen years of sex with the same man
can be a little bit boring, all right?

1008
00:52:34,963 --> 00:52:38,228
I mean, Stephen had his bag of tricks
and I knew them all.

1009
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,526
But did I complain?

1010
00:52:39,702 --> 00:52:42,466
Did I go out
and bang the Federal Express guy?

1011
00:52:43,472 --> 00:52:45,531
And let me tell you something else.

1012
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,108
Stephen does not know
how good he had it.

1013
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:52,179
There is nobody, and I mean nobody,
who's gonna give that man...

1014
00:52:52,347 --> 00:52:54,372
...a better time in bed than I did.

1015
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,485
I could suck the nails out of a board,
and that is a fact.

1016
00:53:00,923 --> 00:53:03,084
Oh, God.

1017
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:05,856
God.

1018
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:09,658
You can't think straight right now.

1019
00:53:09,832 --> 00:53:13,165
You know what I do
when I have a problem?

1020
00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:19,740
Before I go to sleep, I tell myself
I'm gonna wake up with the answer.

1021
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:21,933
And that does it. I do.

1022
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:23,203
You try it.

1023
00:53:23,378 --> 00:53:25,972
You go on upstairs
and get a good night's sleep.

1024
00:53:26,148 --> 00:53:28,616
And tomorrow morning,
it'll all look better.

1025
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:30,775
Oh, Maggie.

1026
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,412
Go on, you'll feel better.

1027
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:40,558
I love you guys.

1028
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:45,356
She's not gonna dump him.

1029
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:51,433
I know how she feels about that man
and how he feels about her.

1030
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,171
He'll be back in this house
by the end of the week.

1031
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:41,014
I don't understand.

1032
00:54:41,623 --> 00:54:42,988
Why did this happen to me?

1033
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:46,594
Oh, sweetie, listen.

1034
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:50,061
Listen, it happens
in every relationship, okay?

1035
00:54:50,232 --> 00:54:52,792
Eventually,
somebody betrays somebody else.

1036
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:56,369
It's either in a big way
or in a million little ones.

1037
00:54:56,538 --> 00:54:58,506
It's just the nature of it, okay?

1038
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:01,438
Oh, Jesus.

1039
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,840
Oh, God.

1040
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:09,184
- What am I gonna do?
- You'll figure it out.

1041
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,376
We'll figure it out.

1042
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:18,959
Come on, we need to pull out
the big idea here.

1043
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:21,755
We should focus on the cover.
How to get it to pop.

1044
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:25,457
Okay, what about this for a cover blurb?
"The 45-Minute Orgasm. "

1045
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:27,898
Forty-five minutes? Who has the time?

1046
00:55:29,571 --> 00:55:32,972
Listen, I really wanna make a statement
with this issue.

1047
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:36,633
It's time to cut ourselves away
from the herd, talk up to the reader.

1048
00:55:36,812 --> 00:55:38,245
I thought we already were.

1049
00:55:38,413 --> 00:55:41,280
What about the piece we did
on living an authentic life?

1050
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:42,747
Oh, come on.

1051
00:55:42,918 --> 00:55:45,011
We tell women
to feel good about themselves...

1052
00:55:45,187 --> 00:55:47,781
...and then we print 15 pieces
on crazy diets.

1053
00:55:47,956 --> 00:55:51,790
We run ads for wrinkle creams,
the models are 20 years old.

1054
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,054
- We're driving women mad.
- Okay.

1055
00:55:55,597 --> 00:55:58,566
I know I'm the new kid,
but here's what I would do...

1056
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:00,292
<i>...if I were in charge of CACHET.</i>

1057
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:03,530
I would tie each issue to a theme.

1058
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:04,729
Brand it.

1059
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:07,205
By branding each issue,
we brand the magazine...

1060
00:56:07,376 --> 00:56:10,277
...giving it a more unique identity
on the newsstand.

1061
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:13,346
I would make sure
that each theme had an edge.

1062
00:56:13,515 --> 00:56:14,607
A sense of humor.

1063
00:56:14,783 --> 00:56:17,343
For instance, the revenge issue.

1064
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:20,146
How to get it, who to stick it to...

1065
00:56:20,322 --> 00:56:22,620
...the fine art of holding a grudge.

1066
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:25,760
We put an actress on the cover,
someone young, hot.

1067
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:28,328
And we make the whole thing irresistible.

1068
00:56:28,497 --> 00:56:31,364
We become the guilty pleasure
of the publishing world...

1069
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:34,093
...and that is how we turn it around.

1070
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:38,334
Come on, Annie.

1071
00:56:38,507 --> 00:56:41,476
Revenge? It's so retro.

1072
00:56:41,977 --> 00:56:43,444
It's old-think.

1073
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:47,480
Don't we all have better things to do?
It's the opposite of what I'm talking about.

1074
00:56:47,649 --> 00:56:49,708
But I would buy that magazine.

1075
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:56,280
Uh, I think we should take a break, okay?
Let all this percolate.

1076
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,016
We'll pick it up after lunch.

1077
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:00,458
Just think about it.

1078
00:57:00,862 --> 00:57:02,727
It's a good idea.

1079
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:09,027
Let me tell you,
editors, they live in fear of a girl like that.

1080
00:57:09,204 --> 00:57:13,038
They walk into your world, you're thinking,
"Wait, am I out of the loop here?"

1081
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:16,377
- I mean, "Am I missing the trends?"
- Climb higher.

1082
00:57:16,545 --> 00:57:19,844
- Can't we take a break?
- No breaks.

1083
00:57:20,015 --> 00:57:22,210
What are the two most feared words
in English?

1084
00:57:22,584 --> 00:57:25,747
- "Pool party. "
- "Keep climbing. "

1085
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,658
Wait a minute. Let me down, okay?

1086
00:57:33,095 --> 00:57:34,357
Thanks.

1087
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:38,527
Hey, Bailey Smith, right?

1088
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,964
Sylvie Fowler.
We met at the MTV Awards.

1089
00:57:41,136 --> 00:57:42,899
Oh, right, right, right, yeah.

1090
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:46,472
<i>So how are things
in the hot seat at CACHET?</i>

1091
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:52,045
<i>Well, I'm not gonna be happy
until I take a nice big chunk out of Vogue.</i>

1092
00:57:52,214 --> 00:57:54,045
- You know how I'm gonna do that?
- How?

1093
00:57:54,216 --> 00:57:56,946
By putting star writers
on the magazine, like you.

1094
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,146
Oh, well, that is a nice compliment,
but I'm not for sale.

1095
00:58:01,323 --> 00:58:04,486
<i>- I'm really happy at The Post.
- Excuse me, but I don't know why.</i>

1096
00:58:04,659 --> 00:58:06,991
You made a reputation
writing brilliant profiles...

1097
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:09,756
...and now
you're writing gossip for a tabloid.

1098
00:58:10,265 --> 00:58:12,256
Wait, I am syndicated.

1099
00:58:12,434 --> 00:58:14,834
I don't have to worry
about money anymore.

1100
00:58:15,003 --> 00:58:18,370
You know, anyway,
I write about people, not fashion.

1101
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,871
That's what I want you to do.

1102
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:23,136
Write about interesting people
in your own irreverent way.

1103
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:24,710
You'll sell magazines.

1104
00:58:25,313 --> 00:58:28,043
I hear your circulation's down.

1105
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:32,482
And didn't you have
some staff defections last week?

1106
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:34,949
Some people can't take the hills.

1107
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:42,060
You know, um, I would consider
doing some pieces for you...

1108
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,892
...but I would need something in return.

1109
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:46,329
Well, you name it.

1110
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:48,435
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1111
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:53,936
Well, I'm doing a series of columns
on high-profile New York marriages.

1112
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:56,976
I hear one of them is breaking up.

1113
00:58:57,312 --> 00:58:58,973
Oh. Oh.

1114
00:58:59,147 --> 00:59:01,707
- You know who I'm talking about.
- I don't know anything.

1115
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:03,612
And who cares, anyway?

1116
00:59:03,785 --> 00:59:05,412
Oh, come on.

1117
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:09,990
Messy divorces sell more papers
than presidential campaigns.

1118
00:59:10,158 --> 00:59:12,786
Sounds like you've written a story.
What you need me for?

1119
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:17,193
You know I need confirmation
from some ironclad source.

1120
00:59:17,365 --> 00:59:19,196
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1121
00:59:20,302 --> 00:59:23,100
Just because you wouldn't do
a favor for me...

1122
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:25,796
...doesn't mean I won't do one for you.

1123
00:59:25,974 --> 00:59:31,071
One of my spies said
they saw your publisher last night...

1124
00:59:31,246 --> 00:59:34,545
<i>...having dinner with Talia Greene
from Harper's Bazaar.</i>

1125
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:39,046
Wait, I am not worried, okay?

1126
00:59:39,221 --> 00:59:40,620
Ned wouldn't replace me.

1127
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,690
He's completely committed
to my vision for the magazine.

1128
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:44,883
Sure, I'm sure.

1129
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:49,895
But it's just that I heard that there
was some heavy wooing going on.

1130
00:59:50,065 --> 00:59:52,727
Bailey, do not print that, okay?

1131
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:55,392
What little staff I have left
would smell blood.

1132
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:58,095
<i>It would completely destroy
my credibility at CACHET...</i>

1133
00:59:58,273 --> 01:00:00,070
...and then I really am out the door.

1134
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:03,734
I know, it's incredible, isn't it,
how a little piece of gossip like that...

1135
01:00:03,912 --> 01:00:08,076
...has the potential
to actually unravel an entire career?

1136
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:13,187
<i>Because, really, when you think about it,
where would you go if you left CACHET?</i>

1137
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:33,508
This is the last time
you're picking the restaurant.

1138
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:35,939
If they're gonna plaster your life
in the paper...

1139
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:38,875
...you would think
they would at least run a decent picture.

1140
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:40,844
Especially next to that Crystal.

1141
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:44,546
Shouldn't she have to have a permit
to wear a dress like that?

1142
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:46,710
You're awfully quiet for a change.

1143
01:00:46,888 --> 01:00:49,015
Oh, tough day at work, is all.

1144
01:00:52,294 --> 01:00:53,886
She's here.

1145
01:00:54,663 --> 01:00:56,153
- Hi.
Hi.

1146
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:58,094
- Alex picked the restaurant, right?
- Heh, heh, heh.

1147
01:00:58,266 --> 01:01:00,029
- Of course.
- That looks good.

1148
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,639
So everybody's seen it, right?

1149
01:01:06,808 --> 01:01:09,504
Okay, no big elephants on the table.

1150
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:13,310
Just when you thought
it couldn't get any shittier.

1151
01:01:13,481 --> 01:01:17,110
Okay, do you wanna have a big laugh
about it right now, huh?

1152
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:18,877
Or you wanna run off with a woman?

1153
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:22,922
- Lf you did, this would be the place.
- Maybe a margarita and a woman.

1154
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:24,319
I like that.

1155
01:01:24,492 --> 01:01:28,053
I think it's gonna be okay, ladies.
She's turned the page.

1156
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,324
Yeah, I've turned the page.
I hired a lawyer today.

1157
01:01:34,102 --> 01:01:37,799
Mary, um, don't you think
maybe it's too soon for lawyers?

1158
01:01:38,473 --> 01:01:40,236
Let things settle down.

1159
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:42,672
A month from now,
everything could look different.

1160
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:44,607
- What?
- I know.

1161
01:01:44,779 --> 01:01:49,978
Okay, I'm gonna take a risk here
and say something that may be...

1162
01:01:50,852 --> 01:01:52,581
There are two sides to every story.

1163
01:01:53,822 --> 01:01:57,280
Any one of us is capable,
under the right circumstances...

1164
01:01:57,459 --> 01:02:01,020
...of making a very big mistake.

1165
01:02:01,463 --> 01:02:03,863
Right? Right?

1166
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:09,627
And a good marriage counselor
might ask:

1167
01:02:09,804 --> 01:02:12,136
"And how were you culpable
in this marriage?"

1168
01:02:12,307 --> 01:02:14,707
Well, I married an asshole.
That's how I'm culpable.

1169
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,207
Which side are you on?

1170
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:18,141
- I'm not taking sides.
Well, pick one.

1171
01:02:18,313 --> 01:02:19,337
I'm on your side.

1172
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:23,482
- My money's on you.
- All right.

1173
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:26,348
Okay. Here's what I wanna know.

1174
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:29,957
I wanna know how somebody
like Bailey Smith faces herself in the mirror.

1175
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:34,221
I wanna know how somebody can make a
living feeding off of somebody else's pain.

1176
01:02:34,396 --> 01:02:36,125
Mary, it's my fault.

1177
01:02:37,999 --> 01:02:39,466
Okay.

1178
01:02:40,702 --> 01:02:42,829
Bailey Smith knew
I was about to be fired...

1179
01:02:43,004 --> 01:02:45,598
...and she knew
that I needed her on the magazine.

1180
01:02:45,774 --> 01:02:47,503
So she practically blackmailed me.

1181
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:50,941
I didn't give her any information.
She had all the details already.

1182
01:02:51,112 --> 01:02:54,707
She just said, "Nod if it's true. "
And that's all I did, is nod.

1183
01:02:57,352 --> 01:02:59,013
I was in a terrible position.

1184
01:02:59,187 --> 01:03:01,451
I was scared.

1185
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:04,820
You know, people do terrible things
when they're scared.

1186
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,460
And this is terrible.

1187
01:03:06,628 --> 01:03:08,425
I know that. I know.

1188
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,690
What is going on with you?

1189
01:03:14,569 --> 01:03:20,565
Guys, I'm fighting for a job
that I've worked for my whole life.

1190
01:03:35,724 --> 01:03:37,521
What was it that you said, Sylvie?

1191
01:03:37,692 --> 01:03:40,456
You said that betrayal is inevitable
in any relationship.

1192
01:03:40,628 --> 01:03:42,755
I thought you were just talking
about marriage.

1193
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:45,161
This is so much worse.

1194
01:03:58,446 --> 01:04:01,313
<i>You don't have
what it takes to run a company like this.</i>

1195
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,881
<i>Now, take a walk and never look back.</i>

1196
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:07,681
<i>My father will never let you
get away with this, Ramona.</i>

1197
01:04:07,956 --> 01:04:10,982
<i>I'm sleeping with your father.</i>

1198
01:04:17,499 --> 01:04:19,091
<i>Who knows moisture better than Dove?</i>

1199
01:04:19,267 --> 01:04:22,327
For God's sakes.
Middle of the afternoon.

1200
01:04:22,504 --> 01:04:25,371
Your daughter's gonna be home
from school any minute.

1201
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:29,340
You want her to see her mother
in her bathrobe again, huh?

1202
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:32,742
I don't look at clocks anymore.
It's very liberating.

1203
01:04:42,857 --> 01:04:44,757
Haines residence.

1204
01:04:44,926 --> 01:04:47,326
Oh. Hello.

1205
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:50,987
Heh, heh.
Sure, I still recognize your voice.

1206
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:54,396
Well, me?

1207
01:04:54,736 --> 01:04:56,533
Holding down the fort.

1208
01:04:57,172 --> 01:04:58,366
Uh...

1209
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:01,839
I'll see if she's still here.

1210
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,938
- It's Mr. Haines. He's on the phone.
- Oh.

1211
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:06,637
Tell him I'm not here.

1212
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:09,978
I'm a bad liar. If I were any better,
I'd be embezzling from you.

1213
01:05:10,151 --> 01:05:12,051
I don't wanna talk to him. I'm busy.

1214
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,314
Okay, look, I'm the housekeeper.

1215
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,981
I cook, I clean, I run errands
and that's it.

1216
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:20,150
I'm not your secretary.
I'm not your mother.

1217
01:05:20,328 --> 01:05:22,319
I'm not your pal. I'm not involved.

1218
01:05:22,497 --> 01:05:25,261
Now, you get over here
and take care of your business.

1219
01:05:32,173 --> 01:05:33,197
Hello, Stephen.

1220
01:05:33,374 --> 01:05:35,934
I haven't talked to the appraiser.
I'll do it next week.

1221
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,543
Let's go. Get out of here, come on.

1222
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,043
Oh.

1223
01:05:40,114 --> 01:05:43,550
Well, I'm sure she'd love
to carve a pumpkin with you.

1224
01:05:44,919 --> 01:05:47,820
Well, thank you for the invitation,
but I think you two are...

1225
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:50,048
You'd be better off on your own.

1226
01:05:50,225 --> 01:05:55,026
Because I wouldn't have the first idea
how to be around you right now, Stephen.

1227
01:05:55,196 --> 01:05:58,688
No, I already told you, it's over.
No marriage counselor.

1228
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,233
I'll have Molly call you.

1229
01:06:05,373 --> 01:06:07,102
Oh, sweetie.

1230
01:06:07,275 --> 01:06:09,209
Oh, I am so sorry.

1231
01:06:09,377 --> 01:06:11,937
I didn't mean for you to hear that.

1232
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:24,157
<i>Mary, I know you're there.</i>

1233
01:06:24,325 --> 01:06:25,849
<i>Why won't you return my calls?</i>

1234
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:27,790
<i>We have to talk about this.</i>

1235
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:32,697
<i>Hey, it's bad form
to screen calls, Mary. Pick up.</i>

1236
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:33,959
<i>Pick up.</i>

1237
01:07:14,876 --> 01:07:16,707
- May I help you?
- Ahh!

1238
01:07:17,145 --> 01:07:19,204
What do you think you're doing...

1239
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,245
...sneaking up on me like that?

1240
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:24,579
What are you doing
casing the house like a Jehovah's Witness?

1241
01:07:24,752 --> 01:07:26,686
I am looking for Mary, okay?

1242
01:07:26,854 --> 01:07:29,516
I've left her a lot of messages,
and she hasn't called me.

1243
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:31,591
- She's not here.
- Where is she?

1244
01:07:31,759 --> 01:07:32,817
Out of town.

1245
01:07:32,994 --> 01:07:35,588
- What about Molly?
- Molly is at school.

1246
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:37,822
That's where the kids go
during the week.

1247
01:07:37,999 --> 01:07:40,297
Heh, heh. Cute.

1248
01:07:40,468 --> 01:07:43,403
Are we done? I have a lot to do.

1249
01:07:43,571 --> 01:07:47,302
Besides, your Pradas
are wrecking my perennials.

1250
01:08:10,665 --> 01:08:11,689
It's Jason.

1251
01:08:11,866 --> 01:08:13,800
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1252
01:08:13,968 --> 01:08:15,367
Ask him if he likes me.

1253
01:08:15,536 --> 01:08:16,969
No, you.

1254
01:08:18,206 --> 01:08:19,730
Oh, man.

1255
01:08:20,141 --> 01:08:21,574
Who's that?

1256
01:08:21,743 --> 01:08:24,075
One of my mom's friends.

1257
01:08:24,379 --> 01:08:27,246
- You'd better go.
- Okay, well, see you later.

1258
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:29,144
See you.

1259
01:08:32,954 --> 01:08:34,319
Hey.

1260
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:36,013
Small world, isn't it?

1261
01:08:37,225 --> 01:08:39,989
So why aren't you in school?

1262
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:42,823
I didn't feel like it today.

1263
01:08:43,231 --> 01:08:44,562
Huh.

1264
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:47,526
So this is kind of a new look
for you, huh?

1265
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:50,095
I leave the house in my uniform.

1266
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:53,638
And then after school,
I change into the stuff I hid in my backpack.

1267
01:08:53,808 --> 01:08:55,901
A lot of the girls do it.

1268
01:08:56,144 --> 01:08:57,475
Oh.

1269
01:08:57,712 --> 01:08:59,270
Clever.

1270
01:08:59,714 --> 01:09:02,182
You wouldn't happen
to have a cigarette, would you?

1271
01:09:07,789 --> 01:09:09,017
Thanks.

1272
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,782
Hey.

1273
01:09:11,259 --> 01:09:14,092
- Does your mom know you smoke?
- No.

1274
01:09:14,262 --> 01:09:16,696
And don't tell her.

1275
01:09:16,864 --> 01:09:18,263
I do it so I won't eat.

1276
01:09:20,201 --> 01:09:21,793
Your weight is fine.

1277
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:24,028
I hate my body.

1278
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:26,298
I wanna look like the models
in your magazine.

1279
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:28,606
Nobody looks like those girls, okay?

1280
01:09:28,776 --> 01:09:29,970
Not even them.

1281
01:09:30,144 --> 01:09:33,238
They're all airbrushed and retouched.

1282
01:09:33,414 --> 01:09:36,440
Then why don't you just put
regular people in there?

1283
01:09:36,617 --> 01:09:39,484
I know it's hypocritical.
Life is complicated.

1284
01:09:40,755 --> 01:09:43,553
Yeah, I'm just starting to figure that out.

1285
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:46,794
Do you wanna talk about it?

1286
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:49,787
No.

1287
01:09:50,932 --> 01:09:52,263
Okay.

1288
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:58,337
How old were you when you had sex?

1289
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:01,098
Thirty.

1290
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:07,647
It was horrible. It hurt like hell.

1291
01:10:08,082 --> 01:10:09,709
And it was totally embarrassing...

1292
01:10:09,884 --> 01:10:12,978
...because we had no idea
what we were doing.

1293
01:10:13,154 --> 01:10:15,884
We were up in his room one night.

1294
01:10:16,057 --> 01:10:19,993
Big Farrah Fawcett poster
staring down on the bed.

1295
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:22,391
<i>Star Wars sheets, it was...</i>

1296
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:24,555
It was just tragic.

1297
01:10:24,732 --> 01:10:27,860
I didn't have sex again
for a really long time.

1298
01:10:28,035 --> 01:10:32,233
But then I met somebody,
and it was worth the wait.

1299
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:36,066
We were crazy for each other.

1300
01:10:36,244 --> 01:10:40,681
And then magically,
and it was all really easy.

1301
01:10:40,982 --> 01:10:43,917
Basically, you're telling me exactly
what my mother would say...

1302
01:10:44,085 --> 01:10:45,643
...if I could even ask her.

1303
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,788
Don't have sex until you're in love.

1304
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:49,281
No.

1305
01:10:49,457 --> 01:10:52,153
No, I've had pretty great sex
just for the hell of it.

1306
01:10:52,326 --> 01:10:54,089
I won't lie to you.

1307
01:10:54,262 --> 01:10:57,322
But there's no sex like the kind
you have when you love somebody...

1308
01:10:57,498 --> 01:10:59,659
...and they love you back.

1309
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:01,958
You'd make the coolest mother.

1310
01:11:02,136 --> 01:11:03,626
Really? No, I wouldn't.

1311
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:05,295
Really?

1312
01:11:05,907 --> 01:11:07,898
I don't know,
kids don't seem to take to me.

1313
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:10,543
You'd be a great mom.

1314
01:11:10,845 --> 01:11:12,574
Not like mine.

1315
01:11:12,747 --> 01:11:16,843
I can be in the same room with her,
and it's like she's not even there.

1316
01:11:17,451 --> 01:11:20,614
Listen to me, Molly.
I know you're going through a tough time.

1317
01:11:20,788 --> 01:11:25,248
And if there's anything you ever
wanna talk about, just call me, okay?

1318
01:11:25,426 --> 01:11:27,189
Promise you'll call me.

1319
01:11:27,895 --> 01:11:29,260
Tell me you promise.

1320
01:11:30,932 --> 01:11:32,331
I promise.

1321
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,828
Okay.

1322
01:11:34,001 --> 01:11:37,459
So where is your mom, anyway?

1323
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:43,468
All right, everyone,
take a deep, cleansing breath.

1324
01:11:45,446 --> 01:11:46,743
Look around.

1325
01:11:46,914 --> 01:11:49,109
Respect the power of nature.

1326
01:11:49,283 --> 01:11:51,581
This is why you have come to the Camp.

1327
01:11:51,752 --> 01:11:53,686
Let it heal you.

1328
01:11:54,021 --> 01:11:56,251
So divorce?

1329
01:11:56,424 --> 01:11:57,982
How many?

1330
01:11:58,993 --> 01:12:00,722
Hold on, I'm coming.

1331
01:12:00,895 --> 01:12:02,624
Don't start without me.

1332
01:12:02,797 --> 01:12:05,823
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1333
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:13,266
I'm just not used to getting up at the crack
of frigging dawn. Excuse my French.

1334
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:15,068
Is this the time you always start?

1335
01:12:15,243 --> 01:12:19,077
Because I'm pretty sure
the lake will still be here at noon.

1336
01:12:19,513 --> 01:12:22,573
We always canoe at dawn.

1337
01:12:23,017 --> 01:12:25,986
I always fake my orgasms.
That doesn't make it right.

1338
01:12:27,655 --> 01:12:29,179
Let's go.

1339
01:12:29,357 --> 01:12:30,790
Lift.

1340
01:12:32,426 --> 01:12:34,087
Swing.

1341
01:12:34,795 --> 01:12:36,285
- Hoist.
Oh, God.

1342
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:37,795
You've got to be kidding.

1343
01:12:37,965 --> 01:12:39,523
Turn.

1344
01:12:40,334 --> 01:12:41,824
March.

1345
01:12:57,618 --> 01:13:01,247
Oh, please. God.

1346
01:13:03,224 --> 01:13:05,055
- Forget it.
- Oh!

1347
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,452
I already tried it.

1348
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,995
Oh, you scared me.

1349
01:13:10,164 --> 01:13:14,601
And how bad an idea was this
in a place with a padlocked refrigerator?

1350
01:13:17,138 --> 01:13:19,504
Leah, right?
Right.

1351
01:13:19,674 --> 01:13:22,302
Mary. I mean, I am just so hungry.

1352
01:13:22,476 --> 01:13:26,071
I'm starving. You need the Hubble
Telescope to see what they put on our plate.

1353
01:13:26,247 --> 01:13:28,841
This place makes Betty Ford
look like Disneyland.

1354
01:13:29,016 --> 01:13:30,313
And I ought to know.

1355
01:13:30,484 --> 01:13:32,714
I ran screaming out of Betty twice.

1356
01:13:33,888 --> 01:13:35,287
Look at that.

1357
01:13:35,923 --> 01:13:37,652
Oh, no. No, thank you.

1358
01:13:37,825 --> 01:13:40,623
How did you get that in here?
They even took away my Altoids.

1359
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:44,663
I made friends with Buck, the ranger boy.

1360
01:13:44,832 --> 01:13:46,697
Another... Guess what.

1361
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:49,233
- Aspiring actor.

1362
01:13:49,403 --> 01:13:52,429
I thought I had left them
all behind in la-la land.

1363
01:13:52,606 --> 01:13:55,131
You know, where your dentist
is writing a screenplay...

1364
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:59,075
...and your gardener's playing Willy Loman
down at a dinner theater in Torrance.

1365
01:13:59,246 --> 01:14:02,079
He got me the joint, I took his headshot.

1366
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,650
Are you an agent?

1367
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:05,911
What do you think?

1368
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:09,955
- How long have you been an agent?
- Oh, since 1852.

1369
01:14:11,392 --> 01:14:13,587
At ICM, they call me the Countess.

1370
01:14:13,761 --> 01:14:18,095
I can turn anybody into a star,
even our little ranger boy.

1371
01:14:18,265 --> 01:14:20,825
And why not? Look at him, he's so cute.

1372
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:23,470
He's cute, I'm bored,
my guesthouse is empty.

1373
01:14:23,637 --> 01:14:26,401
Who knows, he could turn out
to be the next Michael Douglas.

1374
01:14:26,574 --> 01:14:29,168
Another dirtbag who left me, by the way.

1375
01:14:30,511 --> 01:14:32,445
So, what are you in for?

1376
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:35,776
Oh, well, I just ran away from home.

1377
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:39,750
I got fired from all my jobs.
Wife, mother, daughter.

1378
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,823
And I broke up with my best friend,
which, you know, that was the worst.

1379
01:14:44,992 --> 01:14:48,393
- I just bailed out of husband number four.
- Four?

1380
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,861
- No, five.
- Five?

1381
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:54,126
I keep blocking one of them out
because he tried to kill me.

1382
01:14:54,935 --> 01:14:59,531
- What?
- We were on a ski lift in Aspen and I "fell. "

1383
01:15:00,608 --> 01:15:03,941
- What did you do?
- Oh, believe me, I took care of him.

1384
01:15:04,111 --> 01:15:05,271
By the time I was done...

1385
01:15:05,446 --> 01:15:08,574
...there was nothing left but the hair plugs
and the asphalt on the driveway.

1386
01:15:11,786 --> 01:15:13,549
- Ooh, shh. Shh.
- What?

1387
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:16,687
- Why do you keep getting married?
- Oh.

1388
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:22,726
In the end, that's really all there is.

1389
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:26,764
Okay. All right, give me that thing.

1390
01:15:27,568 --> 01:15:29,968
Haven't done this
since I was a freshman in college.

1391
01:15:30,137 --> 01:15:32,571
I ate an entire tube of toothpaste.

1392
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,037
Wait.

1393
01:15:34,575 --> 01:15:36,236
Okay.

1394
01:15:39,814 --> 01:15:41,372
All right.

1395
01:15:41,549 --> 01:15:42,914
All right, here's the thing.

1396
01:15:43,084 --> 01:15:46,542
I'm just a good person, you know.
I just am.

1397
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,712
I really try to do the right thing, I do.
I try to...

1398
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:52,825
You know, I let the person
with the one item go ahead of me...

1399
01:15:52,993 --> 01:15:54,051
...in the grocery line.

1400
01:15:54,228 --> 01:15:56,662
I give money to homeless people.
I recycle.

1401
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:58,799
I never cheat.

1402
01:16:00,401 --> 01:16:01,993
Okay, well, once, I cheated.

1403
01:16:02,937 --> 01:16:04,370
- Really?
- Yeah.

1404
01:16:04,538 --> 01:16:05,596
I was playing Monopoly.

1405
01:16:05,773 --> 01:16:09,368
I was the little top hat,
and I moved it a couple extra spaces there.

1406
01:16:11,879 --> 01:16:14,313
But I was just a kid,
so that probably doesn't count.

1407
01:16:14,482 --> 01:16:17,383
So why am I going on and on about this?
What was my point here?

1408
01:16:17,551 --> 01:16:18,950
Oh, boy, a talker.

1409
01:16:19,854 --> 01:16:22,186
I'm gonna have to figure this out,
you know.

1410
01:16:22,356 --> 01:16:23,380
I am.

1411
01:16:23,557 --> 01:16:25,115
I gotta figure out why...

1412
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:28,523
...at this particular juncture,
my whole world has come tumbling down.

1413
01:16:28,696 --> 01:16:31,062
Can you not bogart that, please?
Thank you.

1414
01:16:31,799 --> 01:16:35,735
I've spent an entire lifetime
trying to be everything to everyone...

1415
01:16:35,903 --> 01:16:39,532
...and somehow,
somebody is always disappointed.

1416
01:16:39,707 --> 01:16:43,905
You know, my dear, sometimes
there's a reason why people's paths cross.

1417
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,743
Let me give you
Leah Miller's secret to life.

1418
01:16:50,784 --> 01:16:52,911
Don't give a shit about anybody.

1419
01:16:53,687 --> 01:16:55,450
Be selfish.

1420
01:16:55,623 --> 01:17:00,856
Because once you ask yourself
the question, "What about me?"...

1421
01:17:01,028 --> 01:17:03,496
...everything changes for the better.

1422
01:17:03,831 --> 01:17:08,131
I mean, after all, who are you?

1423
01:17:08,302 --> 01:17:10,668
What do you want, Mary?

1424
01:19:12,526 --> 01:19:14,494
Oh. Excuse me.

1425
01:19:16,664 --> 01:19:18,222
Excuse me.

1426
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:21,197
Hi, I'm looking for my mother,
Catherine Frazier.

1427
01:19:21,368 --> 01:19:22,630
How's she doing?

1428
01:19:22,803 --> 01:19:25,567
She's still in some pain,
but that's to be expected.

1429
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:27,468
She's in there.

1430
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:30,233
- Oh, thank you.
- Right there.

1431
01:19:34,915 --> 01:19:37,315
It'd be nice
up in your room at this time...

1432
01:19:37,484 --> 01:19:38,712
Mom?

1433
01:19:38,886 --> 01:19:40,217
Mm-mm.

1434
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:45,554
Nurse.
Get you something for the pain.

1435
01:19:45,726 --> 01:19:46,954
- Mom?
No.

1436
01:19:47,127 --> 01:19:48,321
Mary.

1437
01:19:48,495 --> 01:19:50,258
Over here.

1438
01:19:51,932 --> 01:19:54,230
Oh, Mom. Does it hurt?

1439
01:19:55,102 --> 01:19:57,900
I just spent thousands of dollars
to look rested.

1440
01:19:58,072 --> 01:20:00,472
Of course it hurts.

1441
01:20:00,874 --> 01:20:02,739
You look great.

1442
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:04,104
Oh, thank you, thank you.

1443
01:20:04,278 --> 01:20:06,212
I just can't believe you did this.

1444
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,439
Have you looked around lately?

1445
01:20:08,615 --> 01:20:11,516
There are no 60-year-old women.

1446
01:20:11,685 --> 01:20:13,676
I was the only one left.

1447
01:20:13,854 --> 01:20:16,220
No, Mom,
I'm happy you did what you wanted to do.

1448
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:18,722
Really, really.
What have you always said to me?

1449
01:20:18,892 --> 01:20:20,359
Don't look back, no regrets.

1450
01:20:21,495 --> 01:20:23,554
I'm so full of shit.

1451
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:25,892
I have plenty of regrets.

1452
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:31,296
I regret I never accomplished
anything of my own.

1453
01:20:32,005 --> 01:20:33,029
I was ambivalent.

1454
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:37,371
And frankly, I wanted things.

1455
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:41,078
A big house, beautiful clothes.

1456
01:20:41,248 --> 01:20:47,448
It was easier to get status from your father
than to get it for myself.

1457
01:20:47,855 --> 01:20:49,823
I know I failed you in a lot of ways,
Mary.

1458
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:53,255
But probably none more than that.

1459
01:20:53,827 --> 01:20:55,351
No, Mom.

1460
01:20:56,363 --> 01:20:58,627
Do you wanna have
a little bit of tea there?

1461
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:00,633
Thanks.

1462
01:21:02,669 --> 01:21:05,263
Well, I've been thinking
about going back to work.

1463
01:21:06,106 --> 01:21:07,130
Not for Dad.

1464
01:21:07,307 --> 01:21:09,332
I wanna design my own collection.

1465
01:21:09,877 --> 01:21:11,105
Whoa.

1466
01:21:11,278 --> 01:21:13,712
- What brought that on?
- Hitting bottom.

1467
01:21:13,881 --> 01:21:16,441
Having nothing left to lose.
I highly recommend it.

1468
01:21:17,885 --> 01:21:21,343
If it wouldn't blow out 80 stitches,
I'd be smiling now.

1469
01:21:22,389 --> 01:21:24,448
I don't wanna take on
more than I can handle.

1470
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:25,922
Just a small collection.

1471
01:21:26,093 --> 01:21:28,960
- Where are you gonna get the money?
- I'll find some backers.

1472
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:33,094
- What about my inheritance?
- Oh, no, Mom.

1473
01:21:33,267 --> 01:21:35,098
I never did anything with it.

1474
01:21:35,602 --> 01:21:37,627
What could be a better investment
than you?

1475
01:21:37,805 --> 01:21:39,466
No, that's not why I came here.

1476
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,165
Oh, please. I'm in no condition to argue.

1477
01:21:44,845 --> 01:21:46,779
You know something?

1478
01:21:47,481 --> 01:21:50,143
Someday, when I'm sitting here
with my head in a helmet...

1479
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:54,879
...I hope my daughter has as much love
for me as I do for you right now.

1480
01:21:55,722 --> 01:21:56,746
Huh.

1481
01:21:56,924 --> 01:22:00,485
You are even more full of shit than I am.

1482
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:02,287
Yeah.

1483
01:22:35,796 --> 01:22:38,128
Ned, please, um.

1484
01:22:38,298 --> 01:22:39,322
I know.

1485
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:44,301
It's not the strongest issue I've turned out,
but next month is a whole different story.

1486
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:48,464
Bailey Smith is writing a profile
on Christiane Amanpour...

1487
01:22:48,642 --> 01:22:52,874
...and Alex Fisher is getting me
some advanced material on her...

1488
01:22:56,383 --> 01:22:58,613
Ned, you can't do this.

1489
01:22:58,785 --> 01:23:02,118
Nobody turns a magazine around
in under a year.

1490
01:23:02,289 --> 01:23:05,486
Just give me three more issues, okay?

1491
01:23:05,659 --> 01:23:08,355
I have got this great idea.

1492
01:23:09,162 --> 01:23:12,097
How about we do a whole issue
on revenge?

1493
01:23:12,266 --> 01:23:13,631
How to get it...

1494
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,859
...who to stick it to...

1495
01:23:16,036 --> 01:23:18,266
...the lost art of holding a grudge.

1496
01:23:18,438 --> 01:23:21,373
How to construct the perfect rumor.

1497
01:23:22,209 --> 01:23:26,043
The 10 best random acts of getting even.

1498
01:23:26,213 --> 01:23:29,705
And we'll put a hot young actress
on the cover.

1499
01:23:30,617 --> 01:23:32,278
Yes.

1500
01:23:34,388 --> 01:23:36,015
Thank you.

1501
01:23:36,189 --> 01:23:39,124
Yeah, I think it'll be brilliant too.

1502
01:23:39,593 --> 01:23:41,618
Okay, then.

1503
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:44,955
I'll see you in the morning.

1504
01:23:49,136 --> 01:23:51,229
Hello?

1505
01:23:51,872 --> 01:23:53,169
Hello?

1506
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,240
Molly?

1507
01:23:55,842 --> 01:23:57,776
Where is everybody?
Where is everybody?

1508
01:23:57,945 --> 01:23:59,071
Here.

1509
01:23:59,246 --> 01:24:00,338
Hey. Oh, Maggie.

1510
01:24:00,514 --> 01:24:03,506
All that fabric from Italy?
The whole dye lot was off.

1511
01:24:03,684 --> 01:24:07,120
I had to completely recut a pattern
and the fit model didn't show up.

1512
01:24:07,287 --> 01:24:10,779
But it is going to be good.
Maggie, it's gonna be so good.

1513
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:13,256
- Where's Molly?
- She's out there.

1514
01:24:15,596 --> 01:24:16,824
What is she doing?

1515
01:24:16,997 --> 01:24:21,024
Well, she says
she doesn't want to be a woman.

1516
01:24:26,073 --> 01:24:28,007
Hey, Mol.

1517
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,041
Wow.

1518
01:24:31,311 --> 01:24:34,405
You've got quite a little bonfire
going there.

1519
01:24:34,581 --> 01:24:38,017
I started it off with the slenders
and now I'm adding the supers.

1520
01:24:38,185 --> 01:24:39,982
That's the trick.

1521
01:24:44,324 --> 01:24:48,124
Wouldn't it be just great if when
you're born, they give you a rulebook...

1522
01:24:48,295 --> 01:24:52,664
...so every time you came up against
something you had no idea how to handle...

1523
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:55,996
...you just look it up in the book
and there would be the answer?

1524
01:24:56,403 --> 01:25:01,033
You know,
I used to feel sorry for the kids in my class.

1525
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:04,609
Every other weekend with Dad
until Mommy's boyfriend sleeps over...

1526
01:25:04,778 --> 01:25:06,370
...then Dad gets you two in a row.

1527
01:25:07,014 --> 01:25:08,845
I used to feel sorry for them.

1528
01:25:09,383 --> 01:25:10,645
Now I'm one of them.

1529
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:15,452
Listen, Molly,
I know that I haven't been here for you.

1530
01:25:15,622 --> 01:25:19,058
And I'm very sorry about that.
We have a lot to talk about.

1531
01:25:19,526 --> 01:25:21,585
I can't talk to you like I talk to Sylvie.

1532
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:26,822
- You've been talking to Sylvie?
- She's been helping me.

1533
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,192
Well, I wanna help you.
Why won't you let me help you?

1534
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:33,669
Because all you'll do is tell me
that everything is going to be fine...

1535
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,432
...and it's not.

1536
01:25:35,609 --> 01:25:38,442
Dad's living in an apartment
that barely has any furniture.

1537
01:25:38,612 --> 01:25:42,104
That Crystal woman
is coming over all the time.

1538
01:25:42,516 --> 01:25:44,108
She doesn't even call first.

1539
01:25:44,718 --> 01:25:46,709
Then she leaves stuff behind.

1540
01:25:46,887 --> 01:25:49,082
A dress, a purse.

1541
01:25:49,256 --> 01:25:51,884
I don't think
he even really likes her that much.

1542
01:25:52,059 --> 01:25:54,050
He's just lonely.

1543
01:25:54,227 --> 01:25:55,285
He misses you.

1544
01:25:56,763 --> 01:25:59,857
Molly, I can't.

1545
01:26:00,033 --> 01:26:01,295
I just can't.

1546
01:26:02,769 --> 01:26:04,669
I know, I remember.

1547
01:26:04,838 --> 01:26:08,035
I used to watch you get ready
to go out with Dad.

1548
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:12,668
And you'd let me put on your dresses
and your high heels...

1549
01:26:12,846 --> 01:26:16,145
...and draw on some lipstick.

1550
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:18,117
I wanted to be you.

1551
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:25,554
I'm gonna go call Sylvie.

1552
01:26:48,715 --> 01:26:50,273
Hey.

1553
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:52,247
- Hey.
- Mary.

1554
01:26:52,419 --> 01:26:54,979
I wanna know
what you're talking to my daughter about.

1555
01:26:55,155 --> 01:26:57,020
I promised her I wouldn't discuss it.

1556
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:00,091
She's having emotional problems,
now you decide to be discreet?

1557
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:01,921
I thought she needed a safe place.

1558
01:27:02,095 --> 01:27:05,758
I'm the safe place, okay?
That is my job, not yours.

1559
01:27:05,932 --> 01:27:07,695
I'm the mother, not you.

1560
01:27:07,868 --> 01:27:10,428
- She said she loves me.
- Yeah, you never have to say no.

1561
01:27:10,604 --> 01:27:13,971
You show me the stretch marks,
and you can do all the mothering you want.

1562
01:27:14,474 --> 01:27:17,443
And what is this, casual Friday?
It's Wednesday.

1563
01:27:17,611 --> 01:27:19,135
Yeah, I know.

1564
01:27:19,312 --> 01:27:20,677
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1565
01:27:20,847 --> 01:27:23,645
- Something.
- Look, let's just drop it, okay?

1566
01:27:23,817 --> 01:27:26,513
I didn't mean to cause problems.
I was just trying to help.

1567
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,211
Don't you ever get tired of saying that?

1568
01:27:32,692 --> 01:27:36,788
How dare you reprimand me for stepping in
where you should have been all along.

1569
01:27:36,963 --> 01:27:39,625
You have not been there
for your daughter, Mary.

1570
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,392
You've not been there for anybody.

1571
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,832
You're not willing to face the hard stuff.

1572
01:27:44,004 --> 01:27:46,268
Don't you criticize me.
Let me ask you something.

1573
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:49,704
Now that Molly trusts you,
are you gonna betray her like you did me?

1574
01:27:49,876 --> 01:27:52,367
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to be your friend?

1575
01:27:52,546 --> 01:27:55,014
I tried to make it up to you.
What more do you want?

1576
01:27:55,182 --> 01:27:58,015
I wanna know
how you can sell out your best friend.

1577
01:27:58,685 --> 01:28:01,984
I hope that job is worth it, Sylvie,
because it's all you've got.

1578
01:28:02,155 --> 01:28:03,417
I quit my job.

1579
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,651
- What?
- What else could I do?

1580
01:28:05,826 --> 01:28:07,555
I was making terrible compromises.

1581
01:28:07,727 --> 01:28:09,422
I can't believe you quit.

1582
01:28:09,596 --> 01:28:14,192
How could I be so out of whack
that I sold out my best friend?

1583
01:28:14,367 --> 01:28:18,326
You were in an impossible situation.
Of course you'd wanna keep your job.

1584
01:28:18,505 --> 01:28:20,700
It's what you do, and you're great at it.

1585
01:28:20,874 --> 01:28:23,399
It's nothing compared
to being responsible for a child.

1586
01:28:23,577 --> 01:28:26,375
- I don't know how you do it.
- Come on, I'm a terrible mother.

1587
01:28:26,546 --> 01:28:28,411
Look what I'm passing down
from my own.

1588
01:28:28,582 --> 01:28:30,846
I can't even talk to my own daughter
about sex.

1589
01:28:31,017 --> 01:28:34,384
Well, it's easy for me.
I wasn't there changing her diapers.

1590
01:28:34,554 --> 01:28:36,545
- I mean...
- I know, you are helping me out.

1591
01:28:36,723 --> 01:28:39,283
You're doing me a really big favor.
Thank you very much.

1592
01:28:39,459 --> 01:28:42,019
Goddamn it. Thank you.

1593
01:28:42,829 --> 01:28:44,820
Anything I can do.

1594
01:28:44,998 --> 01:28:47,228
You have a huge job, huge.

1595
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,265
I'm so glad I never had children.

1596
01:28:49,436 --> 01:28:52,132
That's the last impermissible thing
you can say at a party.

1597
01:28:52,305 --> 01:28:53,636
That you don't want children.

1598
01:28:53,807 --> 01:28:57,038
Well, I'm gonna have a dinner party
and then you can say that.

1599
01:28:57,510 --> 01:29:00,536
Oh, my God, I'm exhausted.

1600
01:29:02,349 --> 01:29:04,249
We're a mess.

1601
01:29:05,919 --> 01:29:07,978
I like your hair, though.

1602
01:29:22,602 --> 01:29:25,093
You know what?
I got my divorce papers today.

1603
01:29:25,272 --> 01:29:26,330
Oh.

1604
01:29:26,506 --> 01:29:31,808
All I have to do is sign,
and I can't seem to be able to find a pen.

1605
01:29:32,412 --> 01:29:34,607
Mary, look, it's the 21 st century.

1606
01:29:34,781 --> 01:29:37,511
It's okay for people
to fight for their relationships.

1607
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:40,984
You know what this feels like?

1608
01:29:41,154 --> 01:29:44,248
It feels like
that phantom limb syndrome.

1609
01:29:44,424 --> 01:29:48,292
You know that thing where you lose a part
of your body, like an arm or something...

1610
01:29:48,461 --> 01:29:51,624
...but you still have the sensation
that it's there.

1611
01:29:51,798 --> 01:29:54,266
Well, you know,
I'm sure Stephen feels the same way.

1612
01:29:54,434 --> 01:29:57,028
Oh, no,
I'm not talking about Stephen and me.

1613
01:29:57,203 --> 01:30:00,070
I'm talking about you and me.

1614
01:30:11,818 --> 01:30:13,547
Fan out.

1615
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:24,954
Hi, remember me?

1616
01:30:25,131 --> 01:30:27,099
Oh, Mrs. Haines.
- My nails are a mess.

1617
01:30:27,267 --> 01:30:29,758
But why wouldn't they be,
with what I've been through?

1618
01:30:29,936 --> 01:30:31,335
- Do you have time?
- No problem.

1619
01:30:31,504 --> 01:30:33,995
It's the least I could do.

1620
01:30:34,174 --> 01:30:35,505
- Mary?
Sylvie.

1621
01:30:35,675 --> 01:30:37,870
Oh, hi, how have you been?

1622
01:30:38,278 --> 01:30:41,975
Oh, fantastic.
I just had the most fabulous facial.

1623
01:30:42,148 --> 01:30:44,548
So how's it going with you-know-who?

1624
01:30:44,718 --> 01:30:48,518
Oh, absolutely fantastic,
like we never skipped a beat.

1625
01:30:48,688 --> 01:30:51,020
And the sex is just off the charts.

1626
01:30:51,191 --> 01:30:52,749
I am so jealous.

1627
01:30:52,926 --> 01:30:55,986
It's the whole sneaking-around thing
that gives it its yummy edge.

1628
01:30:56,162 --> 01:30:59,290
There's nothing like having an affair
with your estranged husband...

1629
01:30:59,466 --> 01:31:01,593
...to put the spark back in things.

1630
01:31:02,235 --> 01:31:03,497
- Oh.
- Oops.

1631
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:06,195
Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.

1632
01:31:07,073 --> 01:31:09,507
I better go,
before I put my foot in it again.

1633
01:31:09,676 --> 01:31:10,836
Great seeing you, Mary.

1634
01:31:11,011 --> 01:31:13,138
- Call me, okay?
Sure.

1635
01:31:13,313 --> 01:31:16,214
Well, that was awkward.
You don't still see Crystal, do you?

1636
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:18,581
You have to forget what you just heard.

1637
01:31:18,752 --> 01:31:20,743
My life's been complicated enough
this year.

1638
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,047
It's all safe with me.

1639
01:31:23,223 --> 01:31:25,248
- Now, have you decided on a color?
- Yes.

1640
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:28,393
Jungle Red.

1641
01:31:34,634 --> 01:31:36,363
Are you sure, Tanya?

1642
01:31:36,536 --> 01:31:39,562
Oh, God, I can't believe he's seeing her
behind my back.

1643
01:31:39,739 --> 01:31:41,866
I'm practically living with the man.

1644
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:44,374
Doesn't anybody respect rules anymore?

1645
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:48,009
My father's taking me home now.

1646
01:31:48,548 --> 01:31:50,846
God almighty, you scared me.

1647
01:31:51,017 --> 01:31:52,109
I gotta go.

1648
01:31:52,285 --> 01:31:55,812
He said I should say good night.
- Oh, well, come give me a little kiss.

1649
01:31:56,689 --> 01:31:58,020
- That's okay.
- Oh, come on.

1650
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:00,352
We just spent
the whole weekend together.

1651
01:32:00,527 --> 01:32:02,552
It's hot in here and I have my coat on.

1652
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:05,660
All right. Well, good night.

1653
01:32:05,832 --> 01:32:07,561
- Good night.
Uh...

1654
01:32:07,734 --> 01:32:10,726
Good night, who?

1655
01:32:13,106 --> 01:32:15,939
- I asked you to call me Aunt Crystal.
- I don't want to.

1656
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:19,374
Hey, you know, I have bent over backwards
to be nice to you.

1657
01:32:19,546 --> 01:32:22,538
I fixed up your room,
I made you that amazing dinner.

1658
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:25,111
Who screws up macaroni and cheese?

1659
01:32:25,285 --> 01:32:28,311
That's not the point.
The point is that I make an effort.

1660
01:32:28,488 --> 01:32:30,922
Why don't you make an effort?
What's your problem?

1661
01:32:31,091 --> 01:32:32,786
I don't like you.

1662
01:32:34,627 --> 01:32:37,323
Come on.
What kind of stupid answer is that?

1663
01:32:37,497 --> 01:32:38,964
Everybody likes me.

1664
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:42,931
What would your father say
if he heard you talking to me like this?

1665
01:32:43,103 --> 01:32:44,502
I don't think he cares.

1666
01:32:44,671 --> 01:32:46,866
Why, what'd you hear? What'd he say?

1667
01:32:47,807 --> 01:32:49,035
Nothing.

1668
01:32:50,076 --> 01:32:53,239
Oh, by the way,
I won't be here next Friday.

1669
01:32:53,413 --> 01:32:56,211
My mother's having a fashion show.

1670
01:32:56,382 --> 01:33:00,045
Yeah, it's something she's always
wanted to do, and now she's doing it.

1671
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:02,518
My father thinks it's great.

1672
01:33:02,689 --> 01:33:07,558
He finds the whole thing
kind of sexy, in a way.

1673
01:33:07,727 --> 01:33:10,753
You know, a woman
coming into her own and all that.

1674
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:14,297
At least that's what I heard him say.

1675
01:33:14,467 --> 01:33:17,334
Well, enjoy your bath.

1676
01:33:22,942 --> 01:33:24,534
Stephen!

1677
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,581
I don't know what they do in your country,
but you don't throw the tinsel in clumps.

1678
01:33:37,757 --> 01:33:39,349
We place it. We place it.

1679
01:33:39,526 --> 01:33:41,551
Okay, I'm ready to go.

1680
01:33:41,728 --> 01:33:43,662
Oh, my God.

1681
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:45,764
This is it, the big day.

1682
01:33:45,932 --> 01:33:46,990
Look at you.

1683
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:50,102
I don't know how you are
so calm and collected.

1684
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:52,761
- You must be freaking out inside.
- Uta.

1685
01:33:52,939 --> 01:33:55,874
No, I'm really okay.
I always imagined myself doing this.

1686
01:33:56,042 --> 01:33:58,169
I guess I just stood in my own way,
you know?

1687
01:33:58,344 --> 01:33:59,811
Listen, kiddo.

1688
01:33:59,979 --> 01:34:02,504
It doesn't matter what happens tonight.

1689
01:34:02,682 --> 01:34:05,480
What counts is that you showed up.

1690
01:34:05,652 --> 01:34:08,644
I always knew
there was someone else inside of you.

1691
01:34:08,821 --> 01:34:10,982
Thank you, Maggie.

1692
01:34:11,157 --> 01:34:12,351
You know, I just love you.

1693
01:34:21,968 --> 01:34:24,334
Okay. Here I go.

1694
01:34:24,504 --> 01:34:28,099
I'm going.
And, Uta, you'll drop Molly in an hour.

1695
01:34:28,508 --> 01:34:31,170
- Yup.
- All right.

1696
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:35,243
Maggie, can it be?

1697
01:34:35,415 --> 01:34:37,349
Are you involved?

1698
01:34:37,517 --> 01:34:38,541
Oh, shut up.

1699
01:34:38,718 --> 01:34:40,652
Here, decorate.

1700
01:35:01,474 --> 01:35:04,238
You should be on the Discovery Channel.

1701
01:35:14,954 --> 01:35:17,514
It's got too much blue.
We gotta get her a different...

1702
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:19,351
I see that. Just give me a second.

1703
01:35:19,525 --> 01:35:20,822
All right.

1704
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:22,922
- Mary.
- Hey.

1705
01:35:23,096 --> 01:35:26,395
- Excuse me just a second.
- Mom, can you believe the turnout?

1706
01:35:26,566 --> 01:35:29,797
All the best boutiques are here.
If I throw up, will you hold my hair?

1707
01:35:29,969 --> 01:35:31,436
It's going to be great.

1708
01:35:31,604 --> 01:35:33,663
By the way,
your father stopped by earlier...

1709
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,037
...and said to tell you
he didn't think you had this kind of talent.

1710
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:40,509
- Fantastic.
- Don't be bitter. It leads to Botox.

1711
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:44,707
Listen, I'm not sure about
the opening sequence of the show.

1712
01:35:44,884 --> 01:35:47,682
And I think you need to reconsider
where you place the coats.

1713
01:35:47,854 --> 01:35:49,947
Mom,
when you said you'd underwrite me...

1714
01:35:50,123 --> 01:35:52,614
...I didn't think it meant
that you'd be popping by...

1715
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:54,987
...every five minutes
with helpful suggestions.

1716
01:35:55,161 --> 01:35:56,924
But you said you'd value my input.

1717
01:35:57,096 --> 01:36:00,156
That's what you say when you take a lot
of money from someone, Mom.

1718
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:02,733
Nobody ever means it.
Now, go find a seat.

1719
01:36:02,902 --> 01:36:04,870
Just take a look at those coats again.

1720
01:36:07,206 --> 01:36:08,798
Skinny.

1721
01:36:08,975 --> 01:36:10,738
Don't bother Mary.
Okay.

1722
01:36:13,946 --> 01:36:15,538
Hey. Oh, honey, what are these?

1723
01:36:15,715 --> 01:36:17,205
They just came.

1724
01:36:17,383 --> 01:36:18,407
They're from Dad.

1725
01:36:18,785 --> 01:36:19,979
They're from Dad?

1726
01:36:20,153 --> 01:36:22,849
Hey, hey. Fingers crossed for me, okay?

1727
01:36:23,323 --> 01:36:25,052
Okay.

1728
01:36:28,428 --> 01:36:30,555
- Mom?
- Yeah.

1729
01:36:31,464 --> 01:36:33,898
This is really cool.

1730
01:37:04,897 --> 01:37:06,558
Excuse me.

1731
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,929
Hi, Edie.

1732
01:37:10,136 --> 01:37:15,233
You look very rested, Catherine.

1733
01:39:12,191 --> 01:39:13,852
<i>Thank you.</i>

1734
01:39:35,548 --> 01:39:38,574
Oh, Mary, I am so proud of you.

1735
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:40,514
Okay, Mom.

1736
01:39:41,153 --> 01:39:42,780
Everything was beautiful.

1737
01:39:42,955 --> 01:39:44,081
Okay, Mom.

1738
01:39:44,257 --> 01:39:46,919
I guess I'm just living a little vicariously.

1739
01:39:47,093 --> 01:39:50,062
Maybe even jealous.
A little competitive.

1740
01:39:50,229 --> 01:39:52,595
- Mom, more than I need to know.
- Okay.

1741
01:39:52,765 --> 01:39:54,198
I'll take Molly home.

1742
01:39:55,201 --> 01:39:56,862
Mary.

1743
01:39:57,036 --> 01:39:58,731
Mary.

1744
01:39:59,805 --> 01:40:02,467
All right, tell it to me straight.
What did you think?

1745
01:40:02,642 --> 01:40:03,700
It was transforming.

1746
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:07,437
But it doesn't matter what I think.
This is the lady whose opinion counts.

1747
01:40:07,613 --> 01:40:09,137
Glenda Hill, meet Mary Haines.

1748
01:40:09,315 --> 01:40:11,715
This is the head buyer
from Saks Fifth Avenue.

1749
01:40:11,884 --> 01:40:13,909
Hello.
- Oh.

1750
01:40:14,287 --> 01:40:16,653
Wow, I didn't realize you were coming.

1751
01:40:16,822 --> 01:40:20,952
Well, I don't ordinarily crash fashion shows,
but Sylvie called me, insisted that I come.

1752
01:40:21,127 --> 01:40:24,153
Said I'd be missing something if I didn't,
and she was right.

1753
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:25,820
Really? Really?

1754
01:40:25,998 --> 01:40:27,659
I don't know what to say.

1755
01:40:28,501 --> 01:40:32,403
It's a small collection,
but I find it fresh and forward.

1756
01:40:32,572 --> 01:40:36,167
I assume you'd be open to some changes
for the Saks customer.

1757
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:40,167
Hemline here, maybe a jacket there.

1758
01:40:40,346 --> 01:40:42,337
Saks Fifth Avenue
is gonna order my clothes?

1759
01:40:43,215 --> 01:40:45,206
Well,
we'll start with the New York store...

1760
01:40:45,384 --> 01:40:50,549
...and if the clothes do well,
we'll expand to all 59 stores.

1761
01:40:50,723 --> 01:40:53,317
And of course,
we need everything shipped by spring.

1762
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,860
Are you geared up for that?

1763
01:40:56,028 --> 01:40:58,758
I think she's a little shell-shocked.

1764
01:40:59,265 --> 01:41:02,792
- Would you mind if I think about it?
- Think about it?

1765
01:41:04,103 --> 01:41:07,129
Well, don't think too long.

1766
01:41:08,808 --> 01:41:11,333
What do you have to think?
- I have to think about it.

1767
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:13,034
- What is there to think about?
Mary.

1768
01:41:13,212 --> 01:41:17,376
It was so amazing,
and we're so proud of you.

1769
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:21,145
And I am so sorry that I won't be able
to stay longer to help you celebrate.

1770
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,548
But my water just broke.

1771
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:25,679
What?

1772
01:41:28,694 --> 01:41:30,821
- Are we in the right place?
- Are you all right?

1773
01:41:30,997 --> 01:41:33,192
- Hang in there.
- Here comes another contraction.

1774
01:41:33,366 --> 01:41:34,390
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

1775
01:41:34,567 --> 01:41:36,967
The contractions
are only a couple of minutes apart.

1776
01:41:37,136 --> 01:41:39,434
Every baby comes faster
than the one before.

1777
01:41:39,605 --> 01:41:42,130
- My last one came in just two hours.
- It's okay.

1778
01:41:42,308 --> 01:41:44,139
Excuse me, our friend is having a baby.

1779
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:46,744
We need a room now,
so we need you guys to hurry up.

1780
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:49,570
- Does she have insurance?
- She doesn't need insurance.

1781
01:41:49,749 --> 01:41:52,013
Have four, get the fifth one free.
Get her a room.

1782
01:41:52,184 --> 01:41:54,448
Oh, I feel another one coming. Ah!

1783
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,383
- Another one.
- They're a minute apart.

1784
01:41:56,555 --> 01:41:58,182
One minute? She's got a minute.

1785
01:41:58,357 --> 01:41:59,619
- She's got a minute.
Okay.

1786
01:41:59,792 --> 01:42:02,920
I'll take you right to the delivery room.
And who's the birth coach?

1787
01:42:03,095 --> 01:42:05,029
- I am.
- Oh, no, no, I want Alex to do it.

1788
01:42:05,197 --> 01:42:08,098
- What, me?
- I think it'll be a good experience for you.

1789
01:42:08,267 --> 01:42:10,098
Don't worry, I'll help you through it.

1790
01:42:10,336 --> 01:42:12,861
- Oh, oh.
- Oh, my God.

1791
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:14,563
This is gonna be a big baby.

1792
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:16,935
Don't point that thing at me, Edie.
It's loaded.

1793
01:42:17,243 --> 01:42:18,904
Come on, honey. Come on.

1794
01:42:19,078 --> 01:42:20,545
Let's go.

1795
01:42:22,548 --> 01:42:24,812
Glenda Hill? She is an arbiter of taste.

1796
01:42:24,984 --> 01:42:27,111
She's a big deal.
Why didn't you jump on that?

1797
01:42:27,286 --> 01:42:30,517
- I don't think I want such a big order.
- You don't wanna be a success?

1798
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:32,021
Depends on how you define it.

1799
01:42:32,191 --> 01:42:35,558
I mean, I would be very happy
with just a little boutique business.

1800
01:42:35,728 --> 01:42:37,628
And I have a daughter
who really needs me.

1801
01:42:37,797 --> 01:42:40,027
Your daughter looked at you today
in a new way.

1802
01:42:40,199 --> 01:42:43,430
You gave her a mother who got something
for herself. That's important.

1803
01:42:43,602 --> 01:42:45,797
Remember when they said
we couldn't have it all?

1804
01:42:45,971 --> 01:42:48,303
We can have it all.
The question is, do we want it?

1805
01:42:48,474 --> 01:42:50,874
I don't want it all.
I just want a nice piece of it.

1806
01:42:51,043 --> 01:42:53,443
I don't want it all either,
because it's exhausting.

1807
01:42:53,612 --> 01:42:56,308
We can handle anything.
We'll be each other's wives.

1808
01:42:56,482 --> 01:42:58,677
Do you know how loveable you are,
Sylvie Fowler?

1809
01:42:58,851 --> 01:43:00,751
Do you have any idea
how loveable you are?

1810
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,888
Funny you say that, because I met a guy.

1811
01:43:03,055 --> 01:43:04,579
- You met a guy?
- Yeah.

1812
01:43:04,757 --> 01:43:07,089
I'm thinking of giving him
my real phone number.

1813
01:43:07,259 --> 01:43:09,056
- How did it feel?
- Oh, I don't know.

1814
01:43:09,261 --> 01:43:11,786
- I think it was because...
- No, no, no.

1815
01:43:11,964 --> 01:43:14,091
No thinking. How did it feel?

1816
01:43:14,266 --> 01:43:16,928
I felt like... I felt like...

1817
01:43:17,103 --> 01:43:19,765
I couldn't talk. I had butterflies.

1818
01:43:19,939 --> 01:43:21,998
Like that time I found my dog
at the pound.

1819
01:43:22,174 --> 01:43:26,008
- Aw.
- We're very close. You better come inside.

1820
01:43:29,048 --> 01:43:31,608
I want my husband!

1821
01:43:31,784 --> 01:43:33,274
Where the hell is that schmuck?

1822
01:43:33,452 --> 01:43:34,976
He's coming, for crying out loud!

1823
01:43:35,154 --> 01:43:38,021
You are not doing the breathing right.
What is so complicated?

1824
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:39,521
It's like this:

1825
01:43:39,692 --> 01:43:41,785
Somebody get here
before her head spins off.

1826
01:43:41,961 --> 01:43:43,292
I've got your back.

1827
01:43:43,929 --> 01:43:45,863
It's okay.
- Hey, is that Jungle Red?

1828
01:43:46,499 --> 01:43:47,523
- Okay.
Nice.

1829
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,793
Focus on my voice.
Focus right on my voice.

1830
01:43:49,969 --> 01:43:51,027
Focus on my voice.

1831
01:43:51,203 --> 01:43:53,865
- Here comes another contraction.
Okay, now, Edie, use it.

1832
01:43:54,039 --> 01:43:57,338
Use it, Edie, just use it.

1833
01:44:05,384 --> 01:44:08,512
I am never having sex again.
Sew me up right now.

1834
01:44:08,687 --> 01:44:11,781
Okay, so you got through that one, honey,
you got through that one.

1835
01:44:11,957 --> 01:44:14,050
- How's she doing?
- We're a couple pushes away.

1836
01:44:14,226 --> 01:44:16,353
- This baby has a big head.
- Oh, can you see it?

1837
01:44:16,529 --> 01:44:18,121
Oh, God, it's the head.

1838
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,292
Okay, okay, okay.

1839
01:44:25,971 --> 01:44:27,438
It's me, it's me.

1840
01:44:27,606 --> 01:44:28,971
Hello. Stephen?

1841
01:44:29,141 --> 01:44:31,132
A strong one is coming.
- Mary, Mary.

1842
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:32,777
Oh, okay. Hold on, okay.

1843
01:44:32,945 --> 01:44:34,378
Edie, see that Christmas tree?

1844
01:44:34,547 --> 01:44:38,643
Just focus on that Christmas tree
and send all your pain right there.

1845
01:44:56,435 --> 01:44:58,426
That was a good one.

1846
01:44:58,604 --> 01:45:01,596
I'm not gonna make it. Oh, God.

1847
01:45:01,774 --> 01:45:03,674
Edie's having a baby.
Can I call you back?

1848
01:45:03,843 --> 01:45:05,470
No, don't hang up. Talk to him.

1849
01:45:05,644 --> 01:45:07,509
- Alex, I just...!
- Oh, my God.

1850
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,307
He wants to go on a date.
- Good.

1851
01:45:09,481 --> 01:45:11,813
Good? I don't think
I can get past everything.

1852
01:45:11,984 --> 01:45:14,350
You can get past it, just like Alan did.

1853
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,249
- What? Whoa, back up.
- Come on.

1854
01:45:20,359 --> 01:45:22,554
Oh, don't look so shocked.

1855
01:45:22,728 --> 01:45:24,889
Five years ago. It just happened.

1856
01:45:25,064 --> 01:45:26,964
When Alan found out,
it nearly killed him.

1857
01:45:27,132 --> 01:45:29,430
And that nearly killed me.
But he forgave me.

1858
01:45:29,602 --> 01:45:30,899
Not right away, but he did.

1859
01:45:31,070 --> 01:45:33,595
And you know why?
Because he's a good man.

1860
01:45:33,772 --> 01:45:34,898
He knew I loved him.

1861
01:45:35,074 --> 01:45:36,974
And I love him and he loves me.

1862
01:45:37,142 --> 01:45:38,439
And we love the kids.

1863
01:45:38,611 --> 01:45:40,943
And now I'm gonna stop
because I am so exhausted...

1864
01:45:41,113 --> 01:45:43,081
...and I want this kid out of me
right now.

1865
01:45:43,249 --> 01:45:44,307
Get it out!

1866
01:45:45,618 --> 01:45:49,577
Okay, Stephen, here it is, here it is.
I'm gonna own up to my part in all this.

1867
01:45:49,755 --> 01:45:52,815
How could I share myself with you
if I had no idea who I was?

1868
01:45:52,992 --> 01:45:55,961
I want things now that I've put aside,
and I'm gonna get them...

1869
01:45:56,128 --> 01:45:59,928
...and anybody who is a part of my life
is gonna have to want those things for me.

1870
01:46:00,099 --> 01:46:01,293
But this is gonna be hard.

1871
01:46:01,467 --> 01:46:04,129
This is hard work
because trust doesn't happen overnight.

1872
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:09,030
And if you can accept all of that,
I will see you Tuesday at 8.

1873
01:46:09,208 --> 01:46:11,233
That's all I have available, I'm very busy.

1874
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:13,275
- We're crowning.
- I gotta go.

1875
01:46:13,445 --> 01:46:14,469
Okay, ladies.

1876
01:46:14,647 --> 01:46:16,547
Get her shoulders, get her knees.

1877
01:46:16,715 --> 01:46:18,478
- Her shoulders and her knees.
- Okay.

1878
01:46:19,785 --> 01:46:22,276
- One more push, Edie.
Here we go.

1879
01:46:31,263 --> 01:46:32,787
Congratulations.

1880
01:46:34,033 --> 01:46:35,864
It's a boy.

1881
01:46:36,869 --> 01:46:39,770
Oh, my gosh, Edie.
You did it.

1882
01:46:40,606 --> 01:46:41,630
- You did it.
I did.

1883
01:46:43,509 --> 01:46:45,477
I did it.

1884
01:46:49,281 --> 01:46:51,909
Edie had a baby.

1885
01:46:55,654 --> 01:46:58,418
So beautiful.

1886
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:02,253
Look at you. You have a boy.

1887
01:47:13,172 --> 01:47:15,231
Oh, my goodness.

1888
01:47:16,475 --> 01:47:18,807
Hi, little boy.

1889
01:47:27,353 --> 01:47:29,878
- Hello, little baby.
- Sweet boy.

1890
01:53:20,038 --> 01:53:23,405
I think real beauty is real authenticity.

1891
01:53:23,575 --> 01:53:25,440
And it's pretty much as simple as that.

1892
01:53:25,610 --> 01:53:28,238
I think a sense of humor
is really a beautiful thing.

1893
01:53:28,413 --> 01:53:33,749
People become beautiful
when you feel their confidence.

1894
01:53:33,919 --> 01:53:37,787
Because the beautiful thing about being
a woman is that we are so many things.

1895
01:53:37,956 --> 01:53:40,618
Honestly, it takes some cultivation
to know who you are...

1896
01:53:40,792 --> 01:53:44,319
...with all the mixed messages
and different kind of cultural demands...

1897
01:53:44,496 --> 01:53:45,588
...of who you should be.

1898
01:53:45,764 --> 01:53:47,425
Be kind to yourself.

1899
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:52,093
Because I promise you,
it will come and it will evolve...

1900
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:56,400
...and you will see just how spectacular
your "differences" are.

1901
01:53:56,575 --> 01:53:59,043
Being a woman is a gift.

1902
01:54:00,305 --> 01:55:00,898
