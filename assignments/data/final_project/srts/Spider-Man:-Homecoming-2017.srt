1
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,322
<i>Tonight was your first time
at the club, wasn't it?</i>

2
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,950
<i>No, I've been there
a few times before.</i>

3
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,661
<i>Really? How come
I haven't seen you?</i>

4
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,622
<i>I noticed you the first
night I walked in.</i>

5
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,020
<i>You always stand out.</i>

6
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,378
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

7
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,714
<i>How come it took you till
tonight to talk to me?</i>

8
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,634
<i>You're not shy, are you?</i>

9
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,328
<i>Maybe a little.</i>

10
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,402
<i>Are you okay with this?</i>

11
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:13,406
<i>Just taking off with
someone you hardly know?</i>

12
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,491
<i>I trust myself.</i>

13
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,701
<i>What do you mean?</i>

14
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,578
<i>Well, I believe in human nature.</i>

15
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,977
<i>You know, that</i>

16
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,832
<i>people are basically good.</i>

17
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,356
<i>You're right, most people are.</i>

18
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:37,263
<i>Tracie. You spell that
with a "Y" or an "I-E"?</i>

19
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:41,995
<i>"I-E Guys are always
assuming I'm a "T-R-A-C-Y. "</i>

20
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,605
<i>How I hate guys who assume.</i>

21
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,003
<i>Me, too.</i>

22
00:01:56,325 --> 00:02:00,953
<i>- You look like a James.
- Nope, just Jim.</i>

23
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,978
<i>- How about Jimmy?
- No, just Jim.</i>

24
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,232
<i>Oh, come on, you are shy.</i>

25
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,906
<i>Look, uh, there's something
I have been meaning to tell you.</i>

26
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,999
<i>I think you have beautiful hair.</i>

27
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,518
<i>- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.</i>

28
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,714
<i>Brown Bag, this is Brown
Bird, we have audio-visual.</i>

29
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,833
<i>Do you think it's sexy?</i>

30
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,652
Brown Bag, close into one click.

31
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,864
<i>Oh, yeah. There's nothing sexier than
short hair on a beautiful woman.</i>

32
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,284
What is it about big
hair that turns men on?

33
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,935
What is it about big hair
that turns guys on, anyway?

34
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,309
<i>Bad taste.</i>

35
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,405
<i>Look at me. I want
to see your eyes.</i>

36
00:02:55,676 --> 00:03:00,031
<i>Innocent, just the way I like them.</i>

37
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,266
That's him. That's our man.

38
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,727
Car is registered to a Jim Gelway.

39
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,889
<i>Brown Bird, this is
Brown Bag. Move in.</i>

40
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,012
He's testing, Tracie. Tell him

41
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,686
he's got the Midas touch.

42
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,819
You got the Midas touch.

43
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,782
That's 'cause I'm
God's gift to women.

44
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,825
<i>And you know what I think you are?</i>

45
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,641
I think you're a
natural-born cocksucker

46
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,270
and I think it's time you did
what you were born to do.

47
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,748
No.

48
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,542
What is this?

49
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,588
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, shit!

50
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,447
<i>- Fucking bitch!</i>
- Bust him!

51
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,893
<i>Brown Bird, Brown Bag, move in!
Take him! Take him now! Now!</i>

52
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,328
<i>Pull your vehicle to the side
of the road and keep your hands</i>

53
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,496
<i>- where I can see them.</i>
- Fuck!

54
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,958
Police! Pull over, now!

55
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,042
I got him, Alex.

56
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,939
Call for help, now!

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,443
Tracie! Hold on! Don't move!

58
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,571
Stay where you are! Stay still!

59
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,994
Tracie, hold on, we're
going to get you!

60
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,580
- Come on, guys!
- There's nothing to hook on to!

61
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,875
- Give me a hand!
- Hold on!

62
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,193
Alex?

63
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,152
Tracie!

64
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,872
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hi, Megan.

65
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,271
I hope we don't have
that big math test.

66
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,092
- Jezzie.
- Hey, Megan.

67
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,572
Jezzie, guess who called
me again last night?

68
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,556
Oh, let's see, um...

69
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,975
Ah! Good morning, Dimitri.

70
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,353
Hey, Megan, I downloaded some really
cool GIFs. You want to see them?

71
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,146
Yeah, sure. What are they?

72
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,648
We'll see inside.

73
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,467
Agent Flannigan.

74
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,283
Control, check in
Starodubov and Rose.

75
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,601
Check!

76
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,578
Hey, Jezz, what do we call
the Ruskies these days?

77
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,205
Russians, former Soviets? I forget.

78
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,230
<i>New World Order, Devine.
Get used to it.</i>

79
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:25,175
Charles Lindbergh, Lucky Lindy,
or The Lone Eagle, as he was called,

80
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:30,222
is our subject today because
he was the first man to what?

81
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,600
- Megan?
- Fly over the Atlantic?

82
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,854
Very good. First man to fly solo,
non-stop from New York City to Paris,

83
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,691
and that was 1927. An
astonishing accomplishment.

84
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,236
Which brings us to
today's assignment.

85
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:49,033
Let's see which of you can
navigate, or fly, if you will,

86
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:53,245
from our home base to
our hero's website here

87
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,623
in the fewest number of links.

88
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,917
All right, and you're off.

89
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,542
That's very clever, Dimitri.

90
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,370
Megan, might I have
a word with you?

91
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,415
- Save me a seat, okay?
- Okay.

92
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,213
Come to my office.

93
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,174
Take a seat.

94
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:19,665
Now, Megan, you know I understand
the particular pressures of your life.

95
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,376
Your father being who he is.

96
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:26,463
The enormous expectations, all adds
up to rather a lot, doesn't it?

97
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,132
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm.

98
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:33,512
But none of that excuses your
breaking the honour code.

99
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,888
What?

100
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,766
I know all about you
and Dimitri, Megan.

101
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,560
We don't tolerate
cheating, now, do we?

102
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:43,272
Cheating? Mr Soneji,
there's been a mistake.

103
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,607
We only pass notes, you
know, jokes and stuff.

104
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,777
Megan, before you go any further,

105
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,051
best have a look at that.

106
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,285
Mr Soneji?

107
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,453
Yes?

108
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,558
This essay, it isn't mine.

109
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,355
Beg your pardon?

110
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,477
What do you mean?

111
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,964
Oh, my...

112
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,134
Oh, dear girl, I'm...

113
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,908
Oh, dear, dear...

114
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,080
Gary, why is the door locked?

115
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,248
Oh, my God! What happened?

116
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,250
She's collapsed. She's just
collapsed. I'll tell you what,

117
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,169
you stay with her,
I'll get some help.

118
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,697
Okay. Megan? Hey, sweetheart,
can you hear me? Megan?

119
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,847
- Hey, Jezzie.
- Hi, Kila.

120
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,452
- Hey, Hannah, where's Megan?
- She's with Mr Soneji.

121
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,537
Control, I'm en route
to Soneji's classroom.

122
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,622
I'm sure it's just a
meeting that went long.

123
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,273
Well, it's against procedure.
Mr Soneji should know better.

124
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,836
His office.

125
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,599
Mr Soneji? Secret Service, open up.

126
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,354
Mr Soneji?

127
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,692
Do you have a key?

128
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,095
I'm sorry, there seems to
be something stuck in here.

129
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,618
Stand back.

130
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,554
Control, shut down. Stop all
vehicles. Lock on Soneji and Rose.

131
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,250
So, how many of these
boats you have to make

132
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,695
before you become shipshape?

133
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,570
I have never seen a man work
so hard at looking busy.

134
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,783
Alex, it's been eight months.

135
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,287
It's time you forgave yourself.

136
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,964
Vickie,

137
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,305
you know that forgiving yourself is
the one thing a person cannot do.

138

<i>Choose to make contact.</i>

put the pieces together</i>

would murder a teacher</i>

school photograph...</i>

157
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,809
<i>We only know that
he has disappeared</i>

158
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,311
<i>with the 12-year-old daughter
of Senator Hank Rose,</i>

159
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,896
<i>how and why is on the mind of...</i>

160
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,816
<i>Police are trying to find
out who this man really is,</i>

161
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,485
<i>his motives for killing
teacher Amy Masterson</i>

162
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,570
<i>and the kidnapping of Megan Rose.</i>

163
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,490
<i>We go back live to join
reporter Alison Peretsky,</i>

164
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,494
<i>who has been at the scene since law
enforcement officials arrived.</i>

165
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,596
<i>Thank you, Jamie.</i>

166
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,665
<i>It's now approximately four hours
since this tragic story unfolded...</i>

167
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,833
Yes?

168
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,231
<i>Mom...</i>

169
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,280
<i>Please.</i>

170
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,865
<i>I want to go home.</i>

171
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,276
Hello?

172
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,290
You tuned into me, Dr Cross?

173
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,911
<i>That sounds like Alison
Peretsky at WNKW Action News.</i>

174
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,626
Gary Soneji?

175
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,087
That'll do for now.

176
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,429
How did you get this number?

177
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,199
Unlisted numbers? Come on,
Alex, there's no such thing.

178
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,270
It's all out there in the air, you
just have to know how to grab it.

179
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,956
<i>Hey, how do you feel about my
kidnapping being bigger news</i>

180
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,560
<i>than your little tragedy
there with Jim Gelway?</i>

181
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,880
You know, you really ought to give an
interview about what happened that night.

182
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,824
You know what they say about
sharing your pain, it's

183
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,551
<i>very cathartic.</i>

184
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,154
Thanks, but I'm doing okay.

185
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,709
Well, see, now, that's good
to hear. That's very good.

186
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,423
I thought for a while there you
wouldn't be able to get your act back

187
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:20,330
together and that
would be a great shame.

188
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,670
<i>I have been planning
for a long, long time</i>

189
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,510
<i>to involve you in the fate
of our Little Miss Muffet.</i>

190
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,013
Megan.

191
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,804
Do you have trouble
saying her name?

192
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,247
First name rapport? Is that
Hostage Negotiations 101?

193
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,817
Now, come on, Alex, you can do
better than that, can't you?

194
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,197
<i>Do you think you're going to dissect
me in three blinks of an eye?</i>

195
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,299
I'm not that easy.

196
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,870
But with a little patience
and a little help,

197
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,206
you just might profile me to a T.

198
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,372
What makes you think
I'm interested?

199
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,173
They say that when
I die, the case will die.

200
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,552
They say it will be like
a book that I closed.

201
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,761
<i>But the book, it will never close.</i>

202
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,887
Very poetic. What the hell is it?

203
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:25,001
Uh, I have left you something for
your visit with the Roses tonight.

204
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,900
You'll find it in your cold,

205
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,339
<i>corrugated</i>

206
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,442
<i>mailbox.</i>

207
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,871
It's time to get back
to work, Dr Cross.

208
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,061
<i>I have been planning
for a long, long time</i>

209
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,132
<i>to involve you in the fate

210
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,296
<i>Megan.</i>

211
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,424
<i>Do you have trouble
saying her name?</i>

212
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,781
Sorry, Detective,
this is a federal case.

213
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,924
I've been invited.

214
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,369
Bobby. Sir, we have a
detective down here

215
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,864
who may have a piece of
evidence pertinent to the case.

216
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,161
Alex?

217
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,328
Special Agent Craig. Well, I'll be.

218
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,999
Dare I ask?

219
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,381
In my mailbox.

220
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,345
Anything else?

221
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,012
That'll get you inside.

222
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,016
Terry.

223
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,014
Get this to McArthur.

224
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,396
- Who's in charge?
- Ollie McArthur.

225
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:33,421
Pedigree FeBe, made his bones busting
wackos in the Seattle office.

226
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,694
Soneji. Clean?

227
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,259
Clean? Squeaky. Fibres look
generic, fingerprints, nada.

228
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,364
The whole school's a
goddamn forensic vacuum.

229
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,539
All he left us was one very
neatly strangled teacher.

230
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,708
Heads are gonna roll
at the Secret Service.

231
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,631
Oh...

232
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,110
Jezzie Flannigan, Alex Cross.

233
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,655
Agent Flannigan was in charge of the
Secret Service detail at Cathedral.

234
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,724
- Dr Cross.
- Agent Flannigan.

235
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,094
I've read your books on profiling.

236
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,063
Obviously not close enough, but...

237
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:12,437
Kyle, this shoe was IDed by
the Roses. It's Megan's.

238
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,235
Dr Alex Cross, Special
Agent in Charge...

239
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,279
- Oliver McArthur.
- How do you do, sir?

240
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,276
Alex, I'll catch you later.

241
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,278
- Forensics.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,282
The Senator and Mrs
Rose are through here.

243
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,914
But before we talk to them,

244
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,913
have you any idea why
Soneji is involving you?

245
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,789
Not at all.

246
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,587
This way.

247
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,651
Excuse me, shouldn't Agent
Flannigan be in the room with us?

248
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,095
Not a good idea.

249
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,805
Miss Flannigan is not welcome.

250
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,141
But she's a material witness.

251
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,703
She failed the Roses and
she failed the Service.

252
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,038
I think Agent McArthur has a point.

253
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,437
No, he's missing the point.

254
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,712
You saw Soneji every day, five
days a week for how long?

255
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,281
Two years.

256
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,777
You have no idea how much
you know about this case.

257
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,413
Agent Flannigan...

258
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:17,093
<i>They say that when I die,
the case will die.</i>

259
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,679
<i>They say it will be like
a book that I closed.</i>

260
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,763
<i>But the book, it will never close.</i>

261
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,845
<i>Very poetic. What the hell is it?</i>

262
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,601
<i>I have left you something for your
visit with the Roses tonight.</i>

263
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:38,152
<i>You'll find it in your cold,
corrugated mailbox.</i>

264
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,430
Well, for what it's
worth, that's Soneji.

265
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,704
His speech pattern's the same.

266
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,062
Is he, um...

267
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,383
Are we dealing with a sex maniac?

268
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,636
Someone who might, you know...

269
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,514
No, sir.

270
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,059
This man has no such
interest in your daughter.

271
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,178
She's merely a means to an end.

272
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,021
What do you mean?

273
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,522
I see no standard procedure
in anything he's done.

274
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,626
I disagree.

275
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:20,088
This is a professional kidnapping.
It's going to be about money.

276
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,736
Which is good.

277
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,403
But you're saying it
isn't about money?

278
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,245
I think he wants to draw this out.

279
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,753
From what he's said,
whatever his motives,

280
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,837
it's very unusual.

281
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,013
What did he mean about the book?

282
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,009
That it will never close?

283
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,954
I honestly don't know.

284
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,683
Well, I think I do.

285
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:02,072
Let me tell you what this
Gary Soneji is up to.

286
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,739
The last thing he wants is
good crisis management.

287
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,677
What he wants is to confuse.

288
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:12,454
Rancour, mixed signals,
disorientation, those are his tools.

289
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,418
So he calls a local cop.

290
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,585
A damaged cop shouldering
some heavy baggage.

291
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,754
He's using Dr Cross
as his messenger.

292
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,924
Excuse me, the man that kidnapped
our daughter didn't call you,

293
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,323
so your agenda is what, to
insult the man he did call?

294
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:32,270
- Mrs Rose, I never intended...
- No, you wait a second.

295
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,037
A mad man has our daughter

296
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,108
and for some reason he
contacted this man.

297
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,144
Do you know why?

298
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,781
No, ma'am, not yet.

299
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,861
Hello.

300
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,658
You okay?

301
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:36,159
You, uh, got any tips for
helpless situations?

302
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,797
Well, you could smoke
a carton a day...

303
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,900
or you could bounce back.

304
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,722
Yeah, well, I don't see
anywhere to bounce to.

305
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,886
Like to get out of here?

306
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,477
Can I ask you something?

307
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,028
Sure.

308
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,827
What did McArthur mean when he
referred to you as damaged?

309
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,751
Last summer I let a sting
operation get out of control.

310
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,417
My partner was killed.

311
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,185
Hey, Megan. How are you?

312
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,231
Lovely to see you.

313
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,446
Do you recognise my voice?

314
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,909
It's me.

315
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,615
Mr Soneji.

316
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,988
Mmm-hmm.

317
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,745
I brought you that.

318
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,119
A lovely cup of tea with honey.

319
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,917
I know your throat is sore.
It'll make you feel better.

320
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,539
There you go.

321
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,875
It's all right.

322
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,385
You have nothing to
be scared of, Megan.

323
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,157
I'm not scared.

324
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,430
Good.

325
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,371
But you're wondering
what's going on.

326
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,040
I know what's going on,
you're a kidnapper

327
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,209
and you're a sick weirdo.

328
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,616
Megan, you're the most
opinionated girl in my class.

329
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,779
- Think you got that from your mom?
- I want to go home.

330
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,952
You Will.

331
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,558
Just promise me you're going
to behave yourself, okay?

332
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,286
That's all.

333
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,166
Now, listen, if you need to use
the bathroom, or anything at all,

334
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,133
just press that, okay?

335
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,503
I want to go home! Now!

336
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,346
Look, I brought you
some fresh clothes.

337
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:58,013
Please! Mr Soneji, please!

338
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,703
This is a fine gun.

339
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,580
It's Turkish.

340
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,026
Handmade, 1924.

341
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,919
That is nice.

342
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,866
My daddy won it in a game
of poker. Aces and Eights.

343
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,655
Dead man's hand.

344
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,164
That's about as much as
I know about my father.

345
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,783
Have a seat.

346
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:33,344
Do you know of any relationship
between Amy Masterson and Soneji?

347
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,337
Amy? No way.

348
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,072
Why do you ask?

349
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,074
He strangled her.

350
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,348
It's an act of passion.

351
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,581
That's a demonstration of will.

352
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,059
A message.

353
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,862
Take me seriously. What do you see?

354
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,590
- Dr Cross...
- Alex.

355
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,069
Alex, women's intuition, third eye,

356
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,094
sixth sense, whatever
it is, I don't have it.

357
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,264
Sure you do, you just
don't look at it right.

358
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,434
Every face has two aspects.

359
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,811
Now try looking at it down the
middle one side at a time.

360
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,415
Would you say this
man was confident?

361
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,087
Yeah.

362
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,052
- Narcissistic?
- I wouldn't know.

363
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,218
- You ever see any flashes of hatred?
- No.

364
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,386
- Anger?
- No.

365
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,054
- Hostility?
- No.

366
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,890
Look,

367
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,772
everything about him was right.

368
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,936
He was always patient.
He was pleasant.

369
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,625
He had a sense of humour.

370
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,400
I mean, he was the perfect teacher.

371
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,696
What do you see?

372
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,915
I see...

373
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,750
No, I mean about me.

374
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,584
What do you see about me?

375
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,584
And that's why you're
here, isn't it?

376
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,298
To size me up?

377
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,597
Evaluate your primary
material witness?

378
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,722
I see that you're about
to start an argument.

379
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,497
I need to help get her back.

380
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,978
What makes you think
I want a partner?

381
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,333
- You don't.
- That's right.

382
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,812
- I can understand that.
- No, you can't.

383
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,314
Can I tell you why I don't care?

384
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,860
Shoot

385
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,078
Look.

386
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:32,353
When I was assigned to Cathedral,
it was a job I didn't want.

387
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,023
It's a far cry from working
rope-lines or flying Air Force One

388
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,193
but I have been there
for three years.

389
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,364
I have been responsible for
Megan for three years.

390
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:47,118
And that little girl means more
to me than even a partner.

391
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,267
Can you understand that?

392
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,146
I suppose so.

393
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,378
But even if I say no anyway,

394
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,949
you'll probably just follow
me around wherever I go.

395
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:07,555
So, if it's a choice between having
you as a partner or as a stalker,

396
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,660
I guess I'll take my
chances with a partner.

397
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,998
Thank you.

398
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,021
The student drop-off is there.
That's my morning post.

399
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,580
Student sign-in.

400
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:36,250
Cameras are there,
there, there and there.

401
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,195
Motion sensors all
around the periphery.

402
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,196
Foolproof way to
keep the kooks out.

403
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:47,367
Exactly, we were always looking
in the wrong direction.

404
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,536
Which door did he go out?

405
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,794
Uh, that one there. It's a straight
shot to his parking space.

406
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,965
Let's go in.

407
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,176
- His classroom.
- Mmm-hmm.

408
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:14,644
He was teaching the kids how everything
on the Internet is connected.

409
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,234
- Alex, you got a sec?
- Sure.

410
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,900
Listen, I think turf wars
are a total waste of time.

411
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:27,385
If I was out of line
last night, I apologise.

412
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,534
Don't. I've been there.

413
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,373
- Anything you need, you let me know.
- Sure, Mac.

414
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,253
Doctor Cross, you might
want to see this.

415
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,051
- This is Megan's desk?
- Yes.

416
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,743
What are you doing?

417
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,599
Scoping GIFs. Graphic
Interchange Formats.

418
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,499
They're all stego-encrypted.

419
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,502
Somewhere among the billions of
zeros and ones making up this image

420
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,504
is a string of text.

421
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,841
I know about this, it's the cutting-edge
method of passing notes in class.

422
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,445
It's driving the teachers nuts.

423
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,680
How long before you can access it?

424
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,014
Oh, try never.

425
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,268
You don't crack stego
without a password.

426
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,792
Would you take me to his office?

427
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,193
Oh, when you find Soneji,
ask him for the password.

428
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,468
He planted a monitoring virus
on the girl's hard drive.

429
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,532
Every keystroke Megan hit,

430
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,761
Soneji was recording it.

431
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,564
Good move, Jezz.

432
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,148
Angling for a position with
the DCPD. I like that.

433
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,967
Dr Cross, Agent Ben Devine.

434
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,721
Agent Devine is security
systems supervisor.

435
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,556
Well, for now.

436
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,159
We are going to be
thrown to the wolves

437
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:00,003
as soon as they find Megan
Rose dead in a ditch.

438
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,169
Now what makes you so sure
that's what's going to happen?

439
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,169
Me getting fired or
the girl in a ditch?

440
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,092
Sorry, I'm having a
pessimistic day.

441
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,141
Tell me, Soneji, did he...

442
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:21,437
Did he ever show any interest
in what you do? How you do it?

443
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,752
The man never talked to me.

444
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,855
I never talked to him.

445
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,700
Well, thanks for your time.

446
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,865
Hello.

447
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,865
What?

448
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,744
What do you think that is?

449
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,754
- An empty frame.
- Mmm-hmm.

450
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,754
Otherwise known as...

451
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,217
A missing picture.

452
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,978
You onto something?

453
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,837
- A missing picture.
- Mmm-hmm.

454
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:54,174
Our Mr Soneji has a
sense of humour.

455
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:58,299
He didn't just kidnap a little girl,
he turned it into a game.

456
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,012
Okay.

457
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,103
Let's see what you
know, Mr Lindbergh.

458
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,761
- My, my.
- What did he get?

459
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,930
Dr Cross isn't in
cyberspace any more,

460
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,534
you're at a live site looking
through a video camera.

461
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,036
Those arrows down there move it.

462
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,552
Where are we?

463
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,612
I would guess we're
in Soneji's home.

464
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,842
Now we're supposed to
find out where that is.

465
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,785
<i>Oliver McArthur's office.</i>

466
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,955
Yeah, it's me. Hold on.

467
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,899
How about the files?

468
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,469
There.

469
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,591
- On the wall.
- There's a...

470
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,415
Can you zoom in there?

471
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,251
Yeah.

472
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,415
Jonathan...

473
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,753
- "M"...
- "E".

474
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,064
- Hold on. Hold on.
- "L"?

475
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,259
You can't move that around,
can you? It's stationary.

476
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,423
Go back.

477
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,592
No, there's something somewhere
else. I'll guarantee it.

478
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,738
- Right there.
- There.

479
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,762
- What?
- You can zoom.

480
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,929
Focus. There.

481
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,267
Bingo.

482
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,103
- M-E-R...
- Mere?

483
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,329
Mercusio.

484
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,916
M-E-R-C-U-S-I-O.

485
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,253
- 14-32... 35.
- 35.

486
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,421
- Granville.
- Granville.

487
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,614
Gary Soneji is also known as

488
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,426
Mercusio, Jonathan,
1435 Granville Street.

489
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,120
Well done, Alex.

490
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,020
In! In!

491
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,089
Cover up. Zoom in! Left!

492
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,459
Eyes open!

493
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,045
There.

494
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,064
Not until we get the go-ahead.

495
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,086
Turn it out to the roof.

496
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,845
Yeah, he's still dusting.

497
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,539
His surveillance was
better than ours.

498
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,376
He's been at this for years.

499
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,218
Imagine the patience.

500
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,889
The dedication.

501
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,516
You sound like an admirer.

502
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,728
Well, he's...

503
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,985
He's like a spider.

504
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,991
And I happen to like spiders.

505
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,742
He's got an elaborate
setup, here, boss.

506
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,416
You want to see how he
stayed clean at school?

507
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:03,150
It laminates a plastic
veneer over your hands.

508
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,844
Look at this.

509
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:11,685
Foam rubber. Looks like he was
wearing prosthetic appliances.

510
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,161
<i>I understand the Secret Service</i>

511
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,329
<i>are being cautious tonight.</i>

512
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,248
<i>Th ere is speculation that a
full investigation is underway</i>

513
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,918
<i>into how Gary Soneji was
able to kidnap a student</i>

514
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,961
<i>from right under their cameras.</i>

515
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,190
<i>Yes, Kevin. One of the
Secret Service agents...</i>

516
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,362
Evening. What's the problem?

517
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,031
Help! Help me!

518
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,386
<i>You've got a Rule 21
problem, no running lights.</i>

519
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:59,373
Again? I just replaced
the fuses yesterday.

520
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,209
Help! Help!

521
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,712
<i>Sir, no running lights. You're
going to have to follow us in.</i>

522
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,657
Help! Please, help me!

523
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:13,618
Well, let me see what I can do with
the fuse box. Hold on. Hold on.

524
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,100
I'm in here, help me!

525
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,579
<i>I've been kidnapped, help!</i>

526
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,127
Help!

527
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,892
How's that?

528
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,144
Thanks a lot, fellas.

529
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,584
Help!

530
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,608
Help me, please!

531
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,452
Help me, please!

532
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,455
Help me!

533
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,488
"...and before the hood
was pulled over his head,

534
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,283
"he bragged to his executioner,

535
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,869
"'They think that when I die,

536
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,204
"'the case will die.

537
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,583
"'They think it will be
like a book I close.

538
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,376
"'But the book,

539
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,730
"'it will never close."'

540
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:34,115
Soneji was quoting the final words
of Richard Bruno Hauptmann.

541
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,556
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

542
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,602
1932. The infant son
of Charles Lindbergh,

543
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,897
America's greatest
hero, was kidnapped.

544
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,066
When Bruno Hauptmann was arrested,

545
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,569
what followed became known as
"The Crime of the Century."

546
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,239
I believe that Soneji wants
to do the same thing.

547
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,493
You think we're dealing
with a copycat?

548
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,411
Something like that.

549
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,889
Dr Cross.

550
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,235
What does he want from you?

551
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,548
He's brought me in

552
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,010
and left this trail because
he wants me to make sure

553
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,489
that he's properly appreciated.

554
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,667
And in order for him
to achieve this,

555
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,938
he has to kill Megan?

556
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,691
No, no. Not necessarily.

557
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,653
The death of the Lindbergh
baby was accidental.

558
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:38,031
Nevertheless, it's critical
that we pull his strings.

559
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,950
The more we make him
a living legend,

560
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,369
the more likely he is
to keep Megan alive.

561
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,995
Dr Cross, you've been
brought into this case,

562
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,789
what can you tell us
about Gary Soneji?

563
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,501
I can tell you that Soneji
is very determined,

564
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,545
<i>obviously highly capable</i>

565
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,381
<i>and we consider him a
serious adversary.</i>

566
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,799
<i>What about Megan Rose?</i>

567
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,844
<i>Megan Rose is Gary Soneji's ace.</i>

568
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,789
<i>As long as he has
her, he's in control.</i>

569
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,237
<i>Sir, would you assign as
many agents to this case</i>

570
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,406
<i>if she wasn't a Senator's daughter?</i>

571
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:25,105
<i>The size of our task force is a reflection
of who Gary Soneji is, not Megan Rose.</i>

572
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,081
Mr Soneji?

573
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,834
<i>You can parse the
words if you'd like.</i>

574
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,107
Hello.

575
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,588
I need to go to the bathroom.

576
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,131
All right. Be right there.

577
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,484
<i>No, not at this time.</i>

578
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,463
Come on.

579
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,555
Come on.

580
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,533
Hey!

581
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,542
Help!

582
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,335
Please, help!

583
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,861
Help!

584
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,385
Please, help!

585
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,167
Help!

586
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,646
Help me, please!

587
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,448
Help!

588
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,534
Help!

589
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,572
Help me!

590
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,890
Help, please!

591
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,559
Please, help me!

592
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,394
I'm coming!

593
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,838
Hold on!

594
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,898
Help! Help me!

595
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,296
Hold on!

596
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,850
No!

597
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,728
No! Please!

598
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,168
Please!

599
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,128
Please!

600
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,652
No! Help me! Please!

601
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,284
No! Please!

602
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,532
Here. Here.

603
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,851
This'll keep you warm.
There you go.

604
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,021
Megan, you promised me you
were going to behave yourself.

605
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,547
Because of you, what you've
done, that man is dead.

606
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,613
Now, promise me...

607
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:50,344
Promise me you're going to
be a good little girl, okay?

608
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,225
Say, "Yes, Mr Soneji."

609
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,941
Say, "Yes, Mr Soneji."

610
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,212
Yes, Mr Soneji.

611
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,530
Okay.

612
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,827
Now let's go have that cup of tea.

613
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,090
I'd say eight hours.
About 9:00 a.m.

614
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,844
Slugs are large calibre.
Shots hit him here, here.

615
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,513
Kill shot tapped him,
crown of the head.

616
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,433
This here is Thomas
Mathias, he found all this.

617
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,911
This way.

618
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,470
She's not in the water, Jezzie.

619
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,847
Soneji still has her.

620
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,808
- There is no way of knowing that.
- Well, think about it.

621
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,393
Megan is precious cargo.

622
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,563
Soneji is not going to let some
twist of fate bring her harm.

623
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,881
Right?

624
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,133
But why Megan? Why her?

625
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,770
Come on.

626
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:02,521
- Where are you going?
- Back to the city. We'll talk in the car.

627
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,730
You asked, "Why Megan?"

628
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,799
And that's the question we should have
been asking right from the start.

629
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,278
Why Megan?

630
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,792
Who is Senator Hank Rose?

631
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,625
- He's...
- Nobody.

632
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,148
Most people don't
even know who he is.

633
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:31,069
Never heard of him. Couldn't
pick him out of a line-up.

634
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,155
This case is front-page news now,
where will it be in two months?

635
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,366
A Year?

636
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,515
Oblivion. Know why?

637
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:44,275
Because Senator Hank Rose
is no Charles Lindbergh.

638
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,946
- Well, okay, then, who is?
- Ah...

639
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,946
There is the troublesome question.

640
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,781
Come on, Jezzie.

641
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:58,156
Two years, five days
a week. You know Soneji.

642
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:01,242
Who's a bigger fish
than Megan Rose?

643
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,128
Dr Cross, Agent Flannigan,

644
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,965
we appreciate your concern,
but Dimitri is fine,

645
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,427
and our security services are
most capable of protecting

646
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:22,031
the son of the Russian president.

647
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,933
Can we at least talk to him?

648
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,978
Nothing would please us
more than to be of help.

649
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:33,316
But speaking to Dimitri right
now would be inappropriate.

650
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,340
Thanks for your time.

651
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,266
What?

652
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,602
Well, McArthur is drag
netting the bay, right?

653
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,105
And, I mean, he's not
really missing us,

654
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,525
so I was thinking maybe we
could just stick around and,

655
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,220
you know, scope out
the place a bit.

656
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,054
Agent Flannigan, are you...

657
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:28,287
Are you suggesting a stakeout here?

658
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,707
Yeah, you know, stale
coffee, some doughnuts.

659
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,904
No, no, no. That's a first-class
stakeout, Agent Flannigan.

660
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,547
What you are talking about
here would be no frills.

661
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:41,403
You'd only get to think about
stale coffee and doughnuts.

662
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,243
Well, I can handle it if you can.

663
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,531
I get the feeling
you've done this a lot.

664
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,116
Oh, yeah.

665
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,060
Every chance I get.

666
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:54,980
Especially when it's cold and wet.

667
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,304
No parking here.

668
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,723
We are on the clock, Officer.

669
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,225
Everything okay?

670
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,454
Everything is all right.

671
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,502
What's the problem?

672
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,702
Go ahead, Jezzie.

673
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,998
What?

674
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,774
Have one.

675
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,218
Thank you.

676
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,249
Alex, that's Dimitri.

677
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:58,497
Jezzie, it's him. It's him!

678
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,189
Soneji!

679
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,020
Hold it right there!

680
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:32,030
Jezzie, shoot the tyres!

681
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,119
Jezzie!

682
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,546
Jezzie!

683
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,017
Police! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

684
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,830
Jezzie!

685
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,984
Jezzie, you're going to
get Megan back, right?

686
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,653
Yes, we are. I promise.

687
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,927
Use this to get Mr Soneji.

688
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,910
I will.

689
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,388
Thank you.

690
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,666
You talk to Hal, I want you
to bring him up to speed.

691
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,834
Well done, guys.

692
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:52,004
Avert an international crisis
and paint Soneji into a corner.

693
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,339
Not bad for a night's work.

694
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,008
Incoming, Soneji ditched the
patrol car near Reno Park.

695
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,612
Hijacked a tan Sierra. Put one
bullet in the driver's head.

696
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,596
Last seen heading toward Route 50.

697
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,100
Annapolis. I knew it. 75,000 boats.

698
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,186
- Other marinas?
- We're here, dead fisherman here.

699
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:10,439
These, all the marinas, all locked
down, patrol boats in each of them.

700
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,963
All right, listen up.
We got to move fast.

701
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,861
Roadblock Route 50 and triple the
surveillance in the harbours.

702
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,966
I want two choppers on the
pad in five minutes. Let's go.

703
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,184
Son of a bitch.

704
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,547
What's wrong?

705
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,424
I blew it, that's what's wrong.

706
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,330
I had a shot right before
he hit the hydrant.

707
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:53,732
But instead of pulling the trigger,
I was thinking. I was thinking!

708
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,462
Yeah, you were thinking of the
possibility of your shot going astray

709
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,631
and blowing Soneji's head
off, in which case...

710
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,674
We would never find
Megan. I know that.

711
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,619
Well, then, don't beat
yourself up for being prudent.

712
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:07,116
Alex, you don't get it. I was trained
to shoot first and think later,

713
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,017
- and I...
- Jezzie, for heaven's sake.

714
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,291
If you hadn't convinced
me to stay there,

715
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,355
Soneji would have two
victims instead of one.

716
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:17,460
Plus we'd have an international
incident on our hands. You did good.

717
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,588
- Yes, but still...
- You did good.

718
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,866
- Anything?
- No, not yet.

719
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,535
We're sitting on the area.

720
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,934
Chief, Soneji's on the phone.

721
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:45,324
- Soneji?
<i>- Detective Cross?</i>

722
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,994
<i>I want to explain how
the agenda's changed.</i>

723
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,349
<i>You're going to bring me
$10 million in diamonds.</i>

724
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:55,896
<i>Point five carat, colour D, clarity
SI2 in a thermos in nine hours.</i>

725
01:02:55,897 --> 01:03:00,503
<i>If the stones are rigged, laser
tagged, irradiated, the girl dies.</i>

726
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,470
<i>Does that penetrate?</i>

727
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,259
It does.

728
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:07,680
<i>I'll call back. 4:00 p.m. sharp.</i>

729
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,479
He beat the trace.

730
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:15,351
The clock's ticking, people, let's
move this downtown. Let's go.

731
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,737
<i>Dr Cross?</i>

732
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,055
I'm here.

733
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,684
<i>The Watergate. 20 minutes.</i>

734
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,683
<i>There's a package for Mr Antwerp.</i>

735
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,394
Okay, people, let's move.

736
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,235
Don't lose me, kiddo.

737
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,230
You won't even see me.

738
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,630
I'm on police business.
Keep it here, please.

739
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:45,778
Eddy, this way.

740
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,122
Hi, how are you?

741
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,811
Do you have a package
for Mr Antwerp?

742
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,209
Yes.

743
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,302
Yes, sir.

744
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,100
Over there. That one.

745
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,379
Cross.

746
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,381
<i>Leave the phone. Leave the car.</i>

747
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:31,487
<i>Pennsylvania and 6th. The fountain.
Fourteen minutes. Run.</i>

748
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,783
Thanks.

749
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,389
Mac, you there?

750
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,333
- Alex.
<i>- He made me ditch the car.</i>

751
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,999
<i>Looks like it's a running game.
I'm on my way to</i>

752
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,838
6th and Pennsylvania.

753
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,464
I'm left and behind you, Alex.

754
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,155
Bearing onto Pennsylvania.

755
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,704
- Cross.
<i>- 12th and Madison.</i>

756
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,548
<i>Twelve minutes will
get you there. Go.</i>

757
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:33,010
Unit 3, loop on 23rd Street. Unit 6,
take K Street and double back.

758
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,520
You've got four units on top, Alex.

759
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:53,592
Cross.

760
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:57,038
<i>Four minutes. Union
Station. Main entrance.</i>

761
01:06:58,765 --> 01:06:59,912
Jezzie.

762
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,309
<i>Union Station, main entrance.</i>

763
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,545
It's rush hour. He's
drawing him into a crowd.

764
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:36,410
Hey! Hey!

765
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,738
Don't answer that!

766
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,138
I think it's for me.

767
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,456
Cross.

768
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,146
- Cross.
<i>- Keep this phone. Take the Metro.</i>

769
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:07,267
<i>Platform A. You got
two minutes. Go.</i>

770
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,944
Jezzie, Metro,
downstairs, platform A.

771
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,174
Cross.

772
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,797
<i>Go to the centre of the platform.</i>

773
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:15,502
<i>Track 15. Go.</i>

774
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,943
<i>Go to the first car.</i>

775
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,385
<i>You there yet?</i>

776
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,494
Yeah, I'm there.

777
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:10,269
<i>Go to the left side.
Open the window.</i>

778
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:12,290
These windows don't open.

779
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:15,565
<i>You're smart, Detective.
Improvise. Quickly.</i>

780
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,173
Police officer, everybody down!

781
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,947
Get down, everybody down.

782
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,911
Come on, out of the way.

783
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,790
<i>We're ready. All right. Now, throw.</i>

784
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,647
We can neither confirm nor
deny that Gary Soneji

785
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,252
was involved in the incident
on the MTA train this morning.

786
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,962
We've heard rumours
that a ransom was paid.

787
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,046
Can you comment on this?

788
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,319
I can't comment on any of that.

789
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,883
What about Megan Rose?

790
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:05,594
<i>I'm not going to go into
any details at this time.</i>

791
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,323
<i>What do we know about
Soneji's state of mind?</i>

792
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,326
I'm not going to comment
on his mental stability.

793
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,435
You can draw your own conclusions.

794
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:17,898
Now, Senator Rose has agreed to
make a statement, but he's not...

795
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,065
- What's up?
- ...going to answer any questions.

796
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:22,340
The file on Soneji, is it
still on your kitchen table?

797
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,570
Yeah, why?

798
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,344
I'm going to have
another look at it.

799
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,866
This business about
the diamonds, money,

800
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,310
I didn't see it coming.

801
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,454
<i>And the feelings of
absolute helplessness.</i>

802
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:38,187
<i>I am grateful that the FBI is here
with the objective expertise required</i>

803
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:42,157
<i>to find out where my daughter
is. Secondly, I now...</i>

804
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:51,366
This is worse than killing time.

805
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,206
Yeah, but you'd be
amazed at how often

806
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:58,048
the small, neglected things
become the most important.

807
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,502
I've just got the feeling
we are missing something.

808
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,446
Maybe I'm in the
wrong line of work.

809
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,892
Maybe I should take on
something less challenging.

810
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:12,228
You do what you are, Jezzie.

811
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,598
You mean, "You are what you do."

812
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:18,442
No, I mean, you do what you are.

813
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,355
You're born with a gift.

814
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:26,572
If not that, then you get good
at something along the way.

815
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,910
And what you're good at,
you don't take for granted.

816
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,873
You don't betray it.

817
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,645
What if you do betray your gift?

818
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:41,147
Then you betray yourself.

819
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,941
That's a sad thing.

820
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:51,809
- Who is it?
- Police.

821
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,730
Gary Soneji.

822
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,740
Hi, Alex.

823
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,469
Now, right hand,
thumb and forefinger.

824
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,447
Just give me the gun.

825
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:20,629
Alex, you can't shoot me.
You'll never find Megan.

826
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:37,930
Sit down, Alex.

827
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,466
I'm a little concerned,
Alex. I'm a little...

828
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,194
I'm a little worried that you...

829
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:54,721
You don't really care to
understand me any more.

830
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:57,166
That you won't paint
an accurate portrait.

831
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,832
And I need you to convince
me that I'm wrong.

832
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:03,396
Well, in order to do that, we're going
to have to talk about Megan Rose.

833
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:05,357
No. No, no bargaining, Alex.

834
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,068
No cheap interrogation techniques.

835
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,672
It's transparent and it's clumsy.

836
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:13,678
This is between me and you.

837
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,409
I want you to see.

838
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:21,892
I want you to look inside here and
tell me what the fuck you see.

839
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,978
I'm a gift to you, Alex.

840
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,190
I'm a gift to you.

841
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:34,704
And you are beyond pitiful if
you cannot understand that.

842
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,999
I'm living proof that a mind...

843
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,337
The mind is a terrible thing.

844
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,740
I see you've got your
sense of humour back.

845
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:56,888
Yeah.

846
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,728
I wondered what happened to
it during the ransom drop.

847
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,566
The ransom drop.

848
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,190
That was a well-earned $12 million.

849
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,359
Twelve million.

850
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:19,414
Senator Rose says he
can pull strings.

851
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:23,143
Says he can fix it so you keep
the $12 million and walk.

852
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:26,146
All you have to do
is return the child.

853
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:27,874
Where is Megan?

854
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,755
Where's Megan?

855
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,379
Where's Megan?

856
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:36,925
Where's Megan? Where's
Megan? Where's Megan?

857
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:41,494
She's trapped on my boat,
Alex, isn't that right?

858
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,496
Or maybe she's stuck in
a warehouse somewhere

859
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,457
or floating in a river.

860
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,732
Swinging from the end
of a rope. Buried alive.

861
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,944
I envy her.

862
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,624
What would life have been
like with parents like that?

863
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:06,245
Come on, Gary. Blaming your
parents for what you are?

864
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,794
I'm not blaming them, Alex.

865
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,010
They've been punished already.

866
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,675
Oh?

867
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,640
I burned down the house
while they slept.

868
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,517
I was 15 years old.

869
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,605
Was it what you expected?

870
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,985
Not really. It was
a new experience.

871
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,486
What, killing?

872
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:39,658
No.

873
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,119
Being in the newspapers.

874
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:49,771
So, in your opinion, Doctor,

875
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:56,175
were my actions triggered
by nature or nurture?

876
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:01,741
If you want me to
be brutally honest,

877
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:05,813
I think you just have a morbid
desire to burn in hell.

878
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,521
We're done for today.

879
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,317
I'm taking her with me.

880
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,367
You're not taking her anywhere.

881
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,101
I'll send her back to you.

882
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:30,937
You just tell me which
piece you want first.

883
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,844
Oh, shit!

884
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:39,842
Damn it!

885
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:42,512
Alex!

886
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,609
What...

887
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,363
What have you done?

888
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,747
What have you done?

889
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,913
Residents of this normally quiet
suburb are still in shock

890
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,980
as news of the shooting
of Gary Soneji,

891
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:17,426
who is America's most wanted man,
filter through their community.

892
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,153
Apparently Soneji attempted
to confront or even harm

893
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:23,031
members of the kidnapping
taskforce hunting him.

894
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:27,228
So he came after Jezzie
as payback for Dimitri.

895
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,273
Ostensibly, yeah.

896
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,166
That's how you want it on record?

897
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,814
Yeah, for now.

898
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,826
Here they come.

899
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:55,794
Dr Cross, tell me you have at least
an idea of where my little girl is.

900
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,962
I'm sorry, sir, I can't.

901
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,318
You kill the one man
that has the answers,

902
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:02,695
and you're telling me
you haven't a clue?

903
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,197
Not one clue?

904
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,990
The man walked in the fucking room

905
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,264
- and you shot him!
- Senator.

906
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,247
Standing in his shoes, I'd
have done the same thing, sir.

907
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,476
Well, that's your job, not his.

908
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,542
He's supposed to
find my little girl,

909
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:19,613
not shoot the man who
knows where she is.

910
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,190
Senator.

911
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,782
It's not over.

912
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,295
The book is not closed.

913
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:57,814
Alex.

914
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,214
Thank you for saving my life.

915
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,817
Goodbye, Jezz.

916
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,044
You want to hear
something funny, Mac?

917
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,379
Sure, cheer me up.

918
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,835
I congratulated Soneji
on scoring $12 million.

919
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,546
You mean $10 million.

920
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,011
Exactly.

921
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,761
He had no idea what
I was talking about.

922
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,964
I know you. You work at my school.

923
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,756
Eat your food, Megan.

924
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,093
Alex, where is this going?

925
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,502
We've been through these tapes
backwards and forwards.

926
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:07,732
I can't see how this is
helping us find Megan.

927
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,361
Do you know what I see, Mac?

928
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:16,055
Someone was onto Soneji long
before we ever heard of him.

929
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,182
Look at this. What do you see?

930
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:21,102
Agent Devine hauling ass
out to the front gate.

931
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:24,981
Mac, he could have shut this whole
place down from right there.

932
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:27,835
Now you want to tell
me why he didn't?

933
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:32,923
Good God!

934
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,366
Devine was in on it with him.

935
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:38,119
Then when Soneji hit the embassy,
he pulled a double-cross.

936
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,787
He ran his own ransom.

937
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:40,980
No.

938
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,708
Soneji was a loner.

939
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,733
An accomplice would
have been beneath him.

940
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:49,714
I'll tell you what happened.

941
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,738
Soneji was hoodwinked,

942
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,078
and so were we.

943
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:59,307
<i>Details are still emerging,
but this much is clear,</i>

944
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:02,935
<i>the manhunt that began over a
week ago in the nation's capital</i>

945
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:05,146
<i>came to a violent end
late yesterday...</i>

946
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,000
<i>with the death of kidnapper,
Gary Soneji. In this...</i>

947
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,455
Don't move.

948
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:46,020
Turn around, hands on
the wall, feet apart.

949
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,980
Hi, Jezz, where did you come from?

950
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,733
You know something, Devine?
You're pretty stupid.

951
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,276
Your car in the driveway,

952
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:56,197
the TV so loud you wouldn't be
able to hear a SWAT team come in.

953
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,596
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

954
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:16,780
Where's Megan?

955
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:18,970
She's in the barn.

956
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,304
She was so doped up,

957
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:22,640
I don't think she even knew
I took her off the boat.

958
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:24,475
She's still alive?

959
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:28,020
You were supposed to dump her in the
river after you got the diamonds.

960
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:29,897
Yeah, well...

961
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:34,235
Maybe killing a kid is something
I'm not prepared to do on my own.

962
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:37,029
Anyway, today, tomorrow, it's still
going to look like Soneji killed her.

963
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,282
She can't die after
Soneji, you idiot!

964
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,826
It doesn't make any
difference, you know why?

965
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:44,680
They're never going
to find the body.

966
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:51,586
Okay. I'll go do it now,
will that make you happy?

967
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,234
Yeah, it would.

968
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,697
Wait.

969
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,205
Can I see them?

970
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:19,614
Hey, do you realise that
we spent an entire year

971
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:22,059
following Soneji's every move?

972
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:25,437
I think we deserve these.

973
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,835
That beats the hell out of a
Secret Service pension, huh?

974
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,438
Hmm.

975
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,195
Profiling the profiler.

976
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,885
Kidnap from the kidnapper,
that's brilliant.

977
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:43,034
You are a genius, Jezz.

978
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:48,369
Genius has nothing to do with
it, I'm just good at what I do.

979
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:53,856
Well, it didn't hurt that everyone
else involved was a complete half-wit.

980
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,317
You think Alex Cross is a half-wit?

981
01:25:56,318 --> 01:26:00,218
You really believe that he
shot Soneji to save my life?

982
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,114
Cross pulled the trigger

983
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:05,515
because he knew Soneji
didn't have Megan any more.

984
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,579
What are you saying?

985
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:11,874
I'm saying that sooner or later
he's going to figure it out.

986
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:15,104
He already knows Soneji
didn't run the ransom.

987
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,611
He is onto us already, isn't he?

988
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:20,905
No, he's not onto us.

989
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:24,488
But I think he's onto you.

990
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,577
<i>It's Turkish.</i>

991
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:14,038
<i>My daddy won it in a game of poker.</i>

992
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:17,234
<i>It's about as much as I
know about my father.</i>

993
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,128
Megan?

994
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,207
Megan, it's me, honey.

995
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:05,800
Jezzie?

996
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:10,279
Jezzie! Jezzie,
I'm in here! Jezzie!

997
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:13,240
Open up, honey. I'm gonna
take you home. It's all over.

998
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:16,015
Yeah, sure, just hold on a second!

999
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:24,019
Jezzie?

1000
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:26,446
Yeah, honey?

1001
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,194
What happened to that other guy?

1002
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,028
He's dead, Megan.

1003
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:35,159
You're safe now.

1004
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:36,748
Open up.

1005
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:38,993
Jezzie?

1006
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,710
Yeah, honey?

1007
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:43,459
Why isn't there
anyone else with you?

1008
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,944
Megan, it's me.

1009
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:52,924
Now don't be scared of me.
Open the door.

1010
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,788
Megan, I'm going to ask you one
more time to open the door.

1011
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:02,983
Right now! Open the door!

1012
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,852
Megan, open the door, honey!

1013
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:08,689
Listen to me! Open the door!

1014
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,715
Megan, open the fucking door!

1015
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:13,910
Open it! Bitch!

1016
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:21,660
Stop it!

1017
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:25,088
Stop it!

1018
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:37,444
Very clever, Megan.

1019
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:54,256
Come on.

1020
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:08,080
Jezzie?

1021
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:13,624
It's over.

1022
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,168
Drop the gun.

1023
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,722
Alex.

1024
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:26,660
How did you, um...

1025
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,809
Aces and Eights, Jezzie.

1026
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:32,021
Plus your timing was a little off.

1027
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:34,769
I watched the tapes.

1028
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:39,423
You and Devine could have
stopped Soneji at the school.

1029
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,593
Just like you could have stopped
him at the Russian embassy.

1030
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:44,845
But you had a different agenda.

1031
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:47,040
You know something, Alex?

1032
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:51,916
When you said you do what
you are, you were right.

1033
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:55,206
I'm living proof.

1034
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,511
Put the gun down, Jezzie.

1035
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,637
Would you kill another partner?

1036
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:11,889
You're not my partner.

1037
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,216
You all right?

1038
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:33,972
You are a very brave girl, Megan.

1039
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:36,691
Who are you?

1040
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:39,982
I'm a policeman.

1041
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:45,154
My name is Alex Cross.

1042
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:48,949
I'm a friend of your parents.

1043
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,334
Can you take me to them?

1044
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:58,746
Nothing would give
me greater pleasure.

1045
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:03,926
Could you...

1046
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,095
Thanks.
