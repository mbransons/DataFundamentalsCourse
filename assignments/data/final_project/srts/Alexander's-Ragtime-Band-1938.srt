1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,507
- Roger...
- Roger...

3
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,673
Oh, Roger, you haven't
forgotten about the party?

4
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,976
No, but I'm afraid I can't make it.

5
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,043
- But you've got to come. You promised.
- The whole crowd's going to be there.

6
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,113
And besides, I've saved
all my waltzes for you.

7
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,318
- We'll make them up next time.
- It's going to be the best party of the year.

8
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,055
- Sorry. Good night.
- Good night.

9
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,291
I've gotta run, Aunt Sophie.
Can you get home all right?

10
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,163
Yes, but I did want you
to go to that lovely party.

11
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,169
Good night, dear.
I'll see you first thing in the morning.

12
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,637
- Good night, Professor Heinrich.
- You did very well, my boy.

13
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,643
But your pizzicato -
we still have to work on it.

14
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,612
Remember, as more you press,
as less comes out.

15
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,705
I'll take care of it first thing in the morning.

16
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,250
Don't overdo yourself, dear.

17
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,084
Why did you have to say that?
His pizzicatos were perfect.

18
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,752
Perhaps, but these young people today,
we have to keep after them all the time.

19
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,488
If he's going to be a great musician...

20
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,690
If he's going to be a great musician?
A boy with his talent?

21
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,861
Why, do you know where he's gone now?
To work. In the Excelsior bakery.

22
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,600
Slaving away half the night in order to
have more time to practice in the daytime.

23
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,971
- So?
- Yes.

24
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,419
You sawed-off little runt!

25
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,364
Trying to dump your broken-down
horn-pushers off on me.

26
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,798
But you didn't give 'em a chance!

27
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,860
I won't get the stink
out of my place for a week.

28
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,807
You can't treat me like this!
I'll get the police!

29
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,867
I'll get my lawyer! I'll sue ya!

30
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,936
Don't bring that flute back in here!

31
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,244
Say, you must be
kinda hard to please tonight.

32
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,386
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What do you want?

33
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,591
Well, it wouldn't be fresh air
in this cute little cottage.

34
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,024
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,153
They tell me you're going in for music.

36
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,698
Well... here I am.

37
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,001
- What do you play?
- I don't play, I sing.

38
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,766
I've been up at Lefty's for three months.

39
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,137
Well, if you're so good,
why ain't you up there now?

40
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,440
Well, Lefty got fresh and I quit.
But I know I'll be safe here.

41
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,743
Sure. You'll be safe here.

42
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,685
Sure. Just as safe
as in the crater of a volcano.

43
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,812
Give us a beer.

44
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,686
Hey, I'm gonna knock you
right out of your seat tonight.

45
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,626
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- I've got something here that's dynamite.

46
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:27,029
Brand-new. Nobody in Barbary Coast
has ever heard anything like it before.

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,091
You must have wrote it yourself.

48
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,604
No, a friend sent it to me from New York.
Just wait till you hear it.

49
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,572
Stell!

50
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,604
Well, for crying out loud! Snapper!

51
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,881
You're a sight for sore eyes, baby!

52
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,476
- Say, listen. Is this getup on the level?
- Sure. I'm seein' the world.

53
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,180
- I'll say you are!
- Boy, am I glad to see you.

54
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,916
Gang, I want you to meet Stella Kirby.

55
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,582
- Hiya, kid.
- Hi, babe.

56
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,490
We went through school together,
up to the fifth grade,

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,326
and boy, could she spell 'em down.
Here, grab yourself a seat, Stell.

58
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,231
Bring us some beer.

59
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,326
You're looking like a million, baby.

60
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,066
- Did you ever learn long division?
- Never even learned short division.

61
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,802
- And I'm doin' all right without it!

62
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,471
- Ain't she a beaut?

63
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,605
Hey, Bill.

64
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,475
- Here are the fellas I was tellin' you about.
- Hiya.

65
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,110
- Did the other outfit show up yet?
- Yeah.

66
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:24,247
They just got thrown out.
Just wait a minute.

67
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,350
Say, boss. These boys play great.
You oughta hear 'em.

68
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,454
- Tim Dolan send 'em over?
- No, I told 'em to come over.

69
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,023
This one... This one here,
his uncle's a cop. A friend of mine.

70
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,504
Mind your own business from now on.
You're paid to draw beer.

71
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,567
- Are you beginners?
- Yes, sir.

72
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,075
- We've all gotta begin sometime.
- We're pretty good, too.

73
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,407
We've been rehearsing for weeks.
Wait till you hear us.

74
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,505
- Why aren't the others in uniform?
- You see, I was dressed for a concert.

75
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,016
Oh, we can hire 'em for you
if you want 'em.

76
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,781
Eh, you don't look so hot to me.

77
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,421
But all right. I'll give you a try.

78
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,550
- One piece.
- Oh, thanks!

79
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,490
- Thanks, Bill.
- We're in!

80
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,358
Ooh!

81
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,124
- What's the matter?
- The music.

82
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,927
- What?
- It's gone!

83
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,729
- But you had it.
- I must have left it on the streetcar.

84
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,565
- You couldn't have done that.
- What are we gonna do?

85
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,232
- Well, are you guys gonna play or not?
- Oh, sure.

86
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,776
Here. Take this. It's music.

87
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:22,110
- Brand-new. Just come from New York.
- Music, you'd better be good.

88
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,344
If they start throwing bottles at us,
I'll meet you boys on the ferry.

89
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,881
- All right, fellas. Just the chorus.
- Hey, I don't get it.

90
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:37,161
(# tentatively attempts
''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' melody)

91
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,036
What kind of time is this?

92
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,339
Four quarter. Every bar a quarter rest.

93
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,710
It's crazy.

94
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,218
Come on!

95
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,960
That's it, boys. Swing into it.

96
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,651
My music!

97
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,816

(# ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'')

99
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,078
- What's the idea of swiping my music?
- I beg your pardon?

100
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,423
Don't pull any of that ''pardon'' stuff
on me. You in that monkey suit.

101
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:52,055
The minute my back was turned, trying to
set yourself in here with my stuff, huh?

102
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,259
All right, kids.
That's dynamite. You're in.

103
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,234
- Who's in?
- All of you.

104
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,396
Say, don't hook me up with this outfit.

105
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,168
I came here to get a job for myself,
not for this bunch.

106
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,641
It was my music and my singing
that put them over.

107
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,304
- Yeah, but listen...
- They don't know to play. They're rotten.

108
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,371
Oh, and I suppose just because
you can stand up here and shout,

109
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,745
that you know everything
about music, huh?

110
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,910
Fight it out among yourselves,
but it's all of you or nothing.

111
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,286
Beer on the house
for Mr. Alexander and his Ragtime Band.

112
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,451
- My name is not Alexander.
- It's Alexander to me.

113
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,051
Come on with that beer.

114
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,290
- So I don't know music, huh?
- No.

115
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,992
Well, maybe I don't know
the tripe they play up on Snob Hill,

116
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,729
but I know what they like down here
and that's more than you'll ever know.

117
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,704
And if you think that I'm gonna work with
you, you've got another guess coming.

118
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,333
Oh, what made you think
that I'd want you with my band?

119
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,876
Your band?!

120
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,037
- Oh, give me my music...
- Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

121
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,979
This is a situation.
Let's try and figure it out.

122
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,744
Oh, I've got it all figured out.

123
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,548
And I don't want any more to do with you.
Is that plain, fancy-pants?

124
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,283
- Always a pleasure to meet a lady.
- You bet it is.

125
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,985
- Say, you were good.
- I know it.

126
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,392
- Let her go.
- Girlie!

127
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,992
Gee, look at what you've done.
Everything's going along swell

128
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,658
and you have to start
an argument with her.

129
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,329
- That girl's a whiz.

130
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,266
Wait a minute. Let's be reasonable.

131
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,278
Reasonable? Say, what do you think
I am? A half-wit or something?

132
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,110
Don't pay attention to him. He didn't mean
it. He was just shooting off his mouth.

133
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,844
Come on back. Let's pretend
it didn't happen. We all need the job.

134
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,012
Oh, say, I wouldn't go back there
if it was the last job on earth.

135
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,613
I've seen all I want
of that stuck-up pain in the neck.

136
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,681
- Yeah, but look...
- Let go of me.

There he goes again, playing my music.

138

Opening tonight, Alexander's Ragtime
Band! The hottest music on the coast!

139
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,305
And the queen of ragtime, Stella Kirby!

140
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,538
With the finest fish dinner in town!

You call this an opening?

146
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,326
You should have seen the outfit I was with
the night we opened at the Crystal Palace.

147
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,457
That was an opening.

Hello, Martha? It's Roger.
Listen, I've got to talk to Aunt Sophie.

149
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,373
I'll try. Will you hold the phone, please?

150
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,443
It's Roger again.

151
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,006
I have nothing to say to him.

152
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,718
I'm very sorry, Roger.
She won't talk to you.

153
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,125
All right. Thank you, Martha.
Good night.

154
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,267
Alexander!

155
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,326
- You, Alexander!
- Yes?

156
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,938
Thank you. Professor Heinrich!

157
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,604
- So your name's Alexander now?
- Yes, that's right.

158
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,172
Uh, won't you come in and...
sit down and have a glass of beer?

159
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,480
Not tonight.

160
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,921
I just want to know
if you're really serious about all this.

161
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,855
Oh, yes. Very.

162
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:45,090
But Roger, you spent your whole life
preparing yourself for something fine.

163
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,533
How can you throw it all away on this...
this ragtime?

164
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,038
But I like ragtime. I believe in it.

165
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,404
And besides, I have
what I've always wanted: A band.

166
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,308
Won't you stay and listen?
See for yourself.

167
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:03,405
No. You know your own mind.
You always have.

168
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,509
- Good night.
- Good night, Professor.

169
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,246
Hey, come on, come on!
Let's have a little life around here.

170
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,121
- Bring on that girl.
- Right away.

171
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,257
- Who is it?
- It's me.

172
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,799
- What do you want?
- I want to see how you look.

173
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,267
Oh, I look swell.

174
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,238
- Do you mind if I see for myself?
- No, come on in. What do I care?

175
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,802
It cost me my last dime.

176
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,351
- Very nice.
- Oh, thanks, Mr. Astorbilt.

177
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,514
But you know, you shouldn't try to cover
up your lovely throat with those feathers.

178
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,254
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Oh, and look at those flowers.

179
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,320
You don't really need those.
That's just gilding the lily.

180
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,194
Oh-oh.

181
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,860
And look at those ruffles. Now, that
might be all right for some skinny little girl,

182
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,598
but not for a girl
with a gorgeous figure like yours.

183
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,505
- There. Now, see what I mean?
- Hey, wait a minute!

184
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:07,171
Oh, and the very idea
of trying to cover up that beautiful hair!

185
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,340
- There, now.
- Why, you two-by-four snob!

186
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,214
Look what you've done.
You've ruined my dress.

187
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,051
Now, listen to me. You're not
dressing for your sailor friends now.

188
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,646
This isn't Dirty Eddie's.

189
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,421
I'm trying to build a band with class and
distinction, and I'm beginning right now.

190
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,590
Oh, so you're a know-it-all
about women's clothes too?

191
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,428
Well, let me tell you something.

192
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,493
I know how to dress myself and you or
nobody else is gonna tell me what to wear.

193
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,731
Understand?!

194
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,674
You're not going up there looking like
a comic valentine. And stop shouting!

195
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,973
I'll go out the way I want to
or I won't go out at all!

196
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,412
- All right! That suits me too.
- Well, it's good enough for me.

197
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,643
Pickleface is throwing a fit out there.
We'd better hop to it.

198
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,777
- Are you ready, Stella?
- I'm not going.

199
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,878
- Oh, now, Stella...
- Oh, let her go, and good riddance.

200
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,980
I don't want a woman with the band
anyway. Come on, Charlie.

201
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,857
Oh, what a sap I was to let you
talk me into this thing in the first place.

202
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,226
Oh, I knew how it would end
with that conceited...

203
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:02,233
Well, I'm surprised at you, letting him get
your goat. He didn't mean anything by it.

204
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,997
He was just a little excited tonight -
new place, a couple of new boys.

205
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,166
- You can't let us down now.
- There you go, sticking up for him again.

206
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,608
Why, look where he threw my flowers.
I should have slapped his ears down.

207
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,839
You can do that tomorrow.
You've gotta sing now.

208
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,246
Pulling out my feathers,
and giving me all that baloney

209
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,784
about my neck and my figure and my hair.

210
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,686
- Why, I'll see him dead first.
- You're absolutely right.

211
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,350
Don't sing for him. Sing for me.

212
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,293
Why, you dirty dog. Taking advantage
of my sweet nature, huh?

213
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,126
That's a girl, Stella.

214
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,257
Just remember the Three Musketeers.
All for one...

215
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,835
Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck.

216
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,598
Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck.

217
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,372
Three Musketeers, my...

218
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,409
my foot.

219
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,385
Ah! There you are, my tender little dove.
We were just coming to call on you.

220
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:08,688
- Well, I'm in a hurry.
- Stop being a stubborn, ornery female.

221
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,728
You and the maestro
are gonna get acquainted.

222
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,263
Say, I know all I wanna know about him.

223
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,094
And no back talk.

224
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,296
Get in there, the both of you.
Take those chips off your shoulders.

225
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,032
You're both all right if you don't
expect too much. And remember,

226
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,870
I'm staying right outside the door here,
and if I hear any yelling or screaming,

227
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,673
I'm coming back in here
and knock your heads together.

228
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,747
Well?

229
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,392
You and I have
entirely different points of view, Stella.

230
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,229
But we are grown-up.

231
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,600
I don't see why, with a little
common sense, we can't work together.

232
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,502
A simple business arrangement.

233
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,474
Listen. You're out to set the world on fire.

234
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,033
You're all hopped up with the idea
that you've got something to give

235
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,080
and you're gonna do it or bust.

236
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:06,777
Well, that's your business. All I want
is a job, and one job's as good as another.

237
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,515
As long as I can pay my own way,
and you leave me alone.

238
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,184
You have a great voice.
And a great future too.

239
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,490
If you'd only realize your possibilities
and try to make something of them.

240
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,429
Say, I'm doin' all right.
I am what I am,

241
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:25,937
and I'm not gonna let you make me over
into something else just to fit your plans.

242
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:32,035
I guess I have been unreasonable,
only seeing my side of it.

243
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,408
But all this means so much to me.

244
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,073
This music, having my own band.

245
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,947
Whether we like it or not, we're together.

246
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,045
We couldn't have gotten
this job without you,

247
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,647
and you probably couldn't have
gotten it without us.

248
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:52,061
So doesn't it seem sensible that we should
try to meet each other halfway?

249
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,530
Well, it's all right with me.

250
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,764
Well, now! You see how easy it is.

251
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,003
Something tells me
I'm sticking my head in a noose.

252
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,009
Come on!

253
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:09,572
(# ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'')

254
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,383
(# ''Everybody's Doin' It Now'')

255
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,365
- Good afternoon, Miss Kirby.
- Good morning.

256
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,768
(# ''Now It Can Be Told'' on piano)

257
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,442
Good afternoon, Miss Kirby.

258
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,102
Good afternoon.

259
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,321
Oh, hello.

260
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,559
My, you look pretty.
Another new outfit?

261
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,258
Mm-hm.

262
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,458
But I think it's a little too loud.

263
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,970
It makes me feel like a stop sign.

264
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,735
I wonder if you realize how much
you've changed in the last few months?

265
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,800
What do you mean, ''changed''?

266
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,905
Just because I pay more for my clothes
and let my hair go natural?

267
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,610
- Well, that may be part of it.

268
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:02,619
Oh, you mean I'm getting to be a lady.

269
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,178
More refined and agreeable.

270
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,193
You're wrong. I'm just doing it
to save myself a lot of arguments.

271
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,753
Oh, sure.
You're the same stubborn witch.

272
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,958
You wear these good-Iooking clothes
just for business reasons.

273
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:20,698
It burns you up to get prettier every day.
It'd just about break your heart

274
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,536
if anybody told you you were
blossoming into the most beautiful,

275
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,600
- the most charming...
- Why, I'd call him a liar to his teeth.

276
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,610
What's that?

277
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,280
Just a little hit tune I've been working on.

278
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,726
- You mean you wrote it yourself?
- Mm-hm.

279
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,938
- Do you like it?
- Like it?

280
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:15,180
- Why, it's great! It's got everything.
- Oh, take it easy.

281
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,552
No, on the level.
Imagine you having that in you.

282
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,682
Why, it'll make you famous.

283
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,024
I wrote it for you, Stella.
If it's any good, that's why.

284
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:28,122
Oh, thank you, Charlie. I'd love to sing it.

285
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:31,191
Has, uh... His Highness heard it yet?

286
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,733
Nobody's heard it... but you.

287
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,502
Well, say, this is too good to keep.

288
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:40,544
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

289
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,273
Stella.

290
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,714
Oh, come on.
What would the waiters think?

291
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,094
All right, fellas. Let's try
that introduction now without the brass.

292
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,030
Alec! Alec, look. Charlie's just
written a swell new song for me.

293
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,329
What? Holding out on me, huh?

294
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:07,030
Oh, it's nothing. Probably won't
sell more than two million copies.

295
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,903
- Well, let's hear it.
- All right.

296
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,712
- Late again, huh?
- Who, me? I was on the ferryboat...

297
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,274
Now listen to me.
And this goes for all of you.

298
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:23,684
When I say 2:00, I mean 2:00.

299
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:27,054
These rehearsals are just twice
as important as any performance.

300
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,322
We may be tops in this town,
but we haven't even started yet.

301
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,828
Now, if you fellas wanna stick with me,

302
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:34,956
try to get somewhere, like New York,
you're going to have to work.

303
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,625
Now, come on, let's snap into it.

304
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,468
Don't forget that this is an opening night.
You've gotta be better than just good.

305
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,937
Cut that.

306
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,707
- Go ahead, Charlie.
- (plays ''Now It Can Be Told'')

307
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,390
Start over again
from the beginning, Charlie.

308
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,361
Louie.

309
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,421
Bill.

310
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,524
Take the melody.

311
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,603
You take the counterpoint.

312
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:35,988
All right, fellas. Let's fake it
till we get our orchestrations.

313
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,819
(# ''Now It Can Be Told'')

314
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,626
Take over for me, Charlie.

315
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,072
Imagine, you and me like this.

316
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,540
Imagine.

317
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,210
- What happened?
- Don't ask me.

318
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,255
The roof fell in on us.

319
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,348
The minute I started
to sing that song...

320
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,394
The whole world stopped for me.

321
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,555
I'm afraid I even forgot to take a bow.

322
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,395
Let me look at you...

323
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,460
for the first time.

324
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,401
That's for tonight.

325
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,283
And that's for all the times
I've wanted to break your neck.

326
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:56,153
And that's for all the times
I've wanted to slap your ears down.

327
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,129
Do you suppose we've been in love
with each other all this time?

328
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,832
Me? In love with that awful person with
the platinum hair and the loud mouth?

329
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:09,463
Heaven forbid!

330
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,270
Say, you were no Christmas package
yourself, you know.

331
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,412
Oh, darling.

332
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,971
Don't you understand?
I'm an artist.

333
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,574
- Like Pygmalion.
- Like who?

334
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,142
Oh, just a Greek who took a hunk of marble

335
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,190
and molded it and polished it
into a beautiful woman.

336
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,157
Then fell in love with her.

337
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,718
Then you mean that you've just
fallen in love with your... with your...

338
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,492
- Handiwork.
- Oh, that isn't so.

339
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,765
You loved me
from the first day you saw me.

340
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,827
Platinum hair, loud mouth and everything.

341
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,896
I guess you're right.

342
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,073
This is the real thing, isn't it?

343
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,673
It's the realest thing
that ever happened to me.

344
00:31:03,117 --> 00:31:04,584
- Don't say a word.
- What?

345
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:06,882
- Hello, Charlie.
- Don't apologize, don't explain.

346
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:09,149
I know all about it.
I was there when it happened.

347
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:11,214
I pour out my heart
in a song to some dame.

348
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:14,125
She takes the song
and pours out her heart to the boss.

349
00:31:14,195 --> 00:31:16,390
Well, I told you it was a good song.
If you hadn't written it,

350
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:19,058
the little lady and I would have probably
gone on through life slugging each other.

351
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,101
- Well, when's the wedding?
- Don't be so practical.

352
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:22,897
He's just started courting me.

353
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,906
There, go buy me some flowers. The
long-stemmed ones that cost $20 a dozen.

354
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:29,238
- The kind I've never had.
- I will not.

355
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,507
Next you'll be wanting a Kodak, and then
a leopard coat, and then a tin lizzie.

356
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,913
- You'll get ham and eggs, and like it!
- Ham and eggs and champagne.

357
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:38,417
- Champagne for breakfast?
- Certainly. This is a champagne breakfast.

358
00:31:38,486 --> 00:31:40,215
- Good morning. Three?
- Please.

359
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:42,278
This way, please.

360
00:31:50,998 --> 00:31:53,660
And while we're guzzling it,
we'll have to do a little figuring.

361
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:56,532
- You know who's in town?
- No, who?

362
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:03,435
Charles Dillingham.
The big boy himself.

363
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:07,675
Alec, this is the break
you've been waiting for.

364
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:09,113
Yes, sir.

365
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:11,515
- Bring me a phone, please.
- At once.

366
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:14,816
This is Mr. Dillingham's secretary.
Who's calling, please?

367
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:17,551
I'm sorry. Mr. Dillingham is busy.

368
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,616
No, he's not granting any interviews.

369
00:32:19,693 --> 00:32:21,752
But this is a very important matter.

370
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:24,525
My name is Alexander.
I have a very fine band,

371
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:26,964
and I'm sure Mr. Dillingham
would be interested in...

372
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:28,331
Hello?

373
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:30,727
Hello?

374
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:34,196
Well, that doesn't seem
to be the proper approach.

375
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:36,869
Why don't we go down to the hotel,
grease a few palms?

376
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:39,276
Get everybody talking about
Alexander's Ragtime Band:

377
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:43,578
The elevator boy, the chambermaid,
the barber. Din it in his ears.

378
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:45,778
Oh, but that would
only make him suspicious.

379
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:49,482
I'm gonna get him to the Cliff House
if I have to drag him.

380
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:52,321
You know, those big guys all like to eat.

381
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:56,428
Give me that phone.

382
00:32:56,497 --> 00:33:00,297
Stella, you're marvelous.
Uh, Evergreen 2435.

383
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,892
I was reading an interview
of his in The Post last week.

384
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,871
Uh, hello.
Uh... Mr. Dillingham's suite, please.

385
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,908
But you won't be able to
get through the secretary.

386
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:13,777
I got an idea. 
Hello, may I speak to Mr. Dillingham, please.

387
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:16,840
Well, then, will you tell him this is Henri?

388
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:19,546
Henri!

389
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,351
I was for many years
the chef at the Astor House.

390
00:33:23,424 --> 00:33:27,827
I used to cook Pompereau Henri
special for Mr. Dillingham.

391
00:33:27,895 --> 00:33:33,060
I read he's in town and I would like to fix
for him some baby lobsters ŕ la Henri.

392
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:35,295
- Baby lobsters?
- What's that?

393
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:38,202
Oh, a chef named Henri wants to
cook some baby lobsters for you.

394
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:39,170
He was formerly at the Astor.

395
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,970
Baby lobsters in August?

396
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:45,068
Must be first of the season.
Splendid. Find out where he is.

397
00:33:45,146 --> 00:33:49,082
Where am I? Where would I be?
Chef at the Cliff House, of course.

398
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:52,552
Then I can expect him tonight?

399
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,679
Oh, thank you very much!

Hey, Davey.

- I'll lay you ten to one he doesn't show up.

Yeah? You got yourself a bet, brother.
And no welshing.

You welsher.

406

Hey, boss, how about me
doing my number for the old boy?

- That'll land us all on Broadway.
- Yeah. Sitting right on our curbstones.

you got. The clowning can come later.

- Yes, right now.

I gave you last night?

Come on. I'll pay you back.

- She'll have him eating out of her hand.

446
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,210
Look. Champagne.

447
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:01,886
- Won't be long now.
- Yeah, she'll be in his lap any minute.

448
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:04,260
Another crack like that
and I'll throw you right out that door.

449
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:07,926
If he's talking business, why isn't he talking
to you? Or is she managing the band now?

450
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:11,266
Alex will be there when the time comes.
Come on.

451
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:13,329
All right. Come on. Let's hit it.

452
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:16,240
Don't let him think we're too anxious.

453
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:21,779
- You'll like New York.
- Oh, I know I will.

454
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:27,450
Henri, your chef, is a great friend of mine.

455
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:29,512
No food like his in the world.

456
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,058
He's cooked me some baby lobsters.
Won't you share them with me?

457
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,525
Oh, no, thank you. Thank you.

458
00:39:37,164 --> 00:39:40,463
Mm! Superb. My compliments to Henri.

459
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:43,970
Thank you, sir. He'll be pleased, I'm sure.

460
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:46,466
Oh, I'm sorry, I must be going.

461
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,839
I've got to tell Mr. Alexander.
Excuse me, please.

462
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:00,313
Take over for me, Charlie.

463
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:10,489
- What did he say?
- He wants me to go to New York!

464
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:12,498
- What did he say?
- He wants me to go to New York!

465
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:13,999
- New York?

466
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:16,661
He's gonna make me a star.

467
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:20,104
Oh, darling, isn't that the most wonderful
thing you ever heard?

468
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:23,438
- Everything you've wanted for me.
- What about the band?

469
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,412
He says he can't use the band right now
but I know he'll find a place for you later.

470
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:30,712
Oh, isn't it marvelous?
I can't believe it's true.

471
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:32,945
- Pinch me.

472
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,215
Then you really are going?

473
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:38,224
Of course.
This is the biggest chance I'll ever get.

474
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,419
Oh, that's swell for you, Stella.

475
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:43,054
She might at least
have talked to me about it first.

476
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,894
Not just go and say yes
without even thinking about us.

477
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:49,094
Oh, but Alex, this isn't going to
make any difference with us.

478
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:52,605
We can still be together.
You can come on to New York with me

479
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:55,904
and I know Dillingham
will find a place for you before long.

480
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:58,035
Oh, yeah. That'd just be great.

481
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:02,514
But you told me over and over again that
I could make something of myself if I tried.

482
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,416
And now that it's happened,
you're all burned up.

483
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,646
I should have known better
than to expect anything from you.

484
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:10,189
Oh, Alec!

485
00:41:10,257 --> 00:41:13,488
Well, of all the selfish little tinhorn sports.

486
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,960
You're jealous
because he wants me and not you.

487
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:17,428
- Now, Stella...
- Well, just remember,

488
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:20,057
I didn't want to go
with your band in the first place.

489
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:22,863
And all that polishing and molding -
you weren't doing that for me.

490
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:24,631
You were doing that for yourself,

491
00:41:24,705 --> 00:41:26,696
just because you thought
it would help you get ahead.

492
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:29,241
And now that it's backfired and helped me,
you're yelling murder.

493
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:31,436
- All right. Go on. Get out!
- Alex...

494
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:35,072
- Go to New York! Go with him!
- Don't think you wouldn't do the same...

495
00:41:35,148 --> 00:41:36,376
Stella!

496
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,145
Alec!

497
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:40,277
Don't leave her like that.

498
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:43,016
Go back and tell her you're wrong
before it's too late.

499
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:46,388
Siding in with her again, hey?
I'm wrong and she's right.

500
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:50,327
Sure. You don't own Stella.
You can't order her around.

501
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:52,865
She has a right to decide for herself.

502
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:55,026
She doesn't owe this band a thing.

503
00:41:55,102 --> 00:41:57,832
We're liable to be stuck here
for the rest of our lives.

504
00:41:57,904 --> 00:42:00,236
- Is that the way you feel about it?
- Exactly.

505
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:04,300
Well, then what are you sticking around
for? Why don't you clear out, too?

506
00:42:04,378 --> 00:42:06,369
That's a good idea.

507
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:10,840
Well, maestro, when does Alexander's
Ragtime Band hit Broadway?

508
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:14,541
There isn't any Alexander's Ragtime Band.

509
00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:15,038

Just what did you do
before you joined up in this man's army?

515
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,196
- I was an orchestra leader, sir.
- Yeah, I was a drummer. We had a swell...

About face.

- I'm dead.

520
00:44:09,155 --> 00:44:12,682
- What'd happen if we resigned?
- We'd get shot.

521
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:14,351
It'd be a pleasure.

522
00:44:14,427 --> 00:44:17,191
Of course, if we'd have been
smart enough to get in the Navy...

- What's Boom Boom?

That's a show the Navy's putting on
in New York.

525
00:44:24,604 --> 00:44:26,538
Pretty soft for those swabs.

526
00:44:26,606 --> 00:44:31,066
No more guard duty, no more
bayonet drill. No more sore feet.

527
00:44:31,144 --> 00:44:32,975
Why didn't we go in the Navy?

528
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:34,570
- A show in New York?
- Yeah.

529
00:44:34,648 --> 00:44:36,639
Let me see that.

530
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,545
Theatricals? You're crazy.

531
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:42,383
- I told them it was no use.
- Ridiculous, I said.

532
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:44,980
I said this wasn't the theater.
They're in the Army now.

533
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:47,458
- But the Navy did it, sir.
- The Navy.

534
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:50,587
- They have time for such tomfoolery.
- Besides, they have the talent.

535
00:44:50,664 --> 00:44:53,462
Talent in the Navy? Nonsense!

536

If you can find talent in the Navy,
you can find it anywhere.

00:44:58,872 --> 00:45:01,397
All right. Go ahead.

00:51:33,499 --> 00:51:36,730
- This is certainly a long intermission.
- Yes, I wonder what's delaying the show?

596
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:38,634
Program says eight minutes.
More like half an hour.

597
00:51:38,705 --> 00:51:40,866
- Attention!
- Maybe that's it now.

598
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,498
- So long, boys. I'll see you later.
- So long.

599
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:44,839
Forward... right!

600
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:54,680
(# ''We're on our Way to France'')

601
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:44,063
- Goodbye! We're going to France.
- No!

602
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:56,207
Alex! Alex!

603
00:53:07,093 --> 00:53:09,084
- Alex!

604
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:27,178
All right, folks. That's all
until tomorrow morning at 8:00.

605
00:54:27,249 --> 00:54:29,843
Clear the stage. Everybody
except Miss Kirby, clear the stage.

606
00:54:29,918 --> 00:54:32,819
All right, boys.
You can get your picture now.

607
00:54:32,888 --> 00:54:34,549
Please give the boys a picture.

608
00:54:34,623 --> 00:54:37,421
How about leaning against the piano,
Miss Kirby?

609
00:54:37,493 --> 00:54:39,791
All right boys, set 'em up.

610
00:54:40,395 --> 00:54:41,828
Miss Kirby.

611
00:54:41,897 --> 00:54:43,888
All right, boys.

612
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:47,697
- Thank you, Miss Kirby.
- You're welcome.

613
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,968
- Has anyone a cigarette?
- Will you try one of mine?

614
00:54:54,343 --> 00:54:57,073
- Alex!
- Hello, Stella.

615
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:01,338
- Well, where in the world...
- I saw your name out front.

616
00:55:01,416 --> 00:55:04,180
Thought I'd just drop in and say hello.

617
00:55:04,253 --> 00:55:06,346
When did you get back?

618
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:08,753
Oh, a couple of days ago.

619
00:55:08,824 --> 00:55:12,055
- Are you all right?
- Sure, sure.

620
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,528
- Did you get up to the front?
- Oh, off and on.

621
00:55:15,597 --> 00:55:19,431
But you... you didn't get hit?

622
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:23,597
Oh, this? No, no.
Just a fad I picked up on the other side.

623
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:28,666
Without my stick, I'd feel completely
undressed. No, no. I didn't get a scratch.

624
00:55:28,744 --> 00:55:31,508
Oh, it was all so horrible
and useless, wasn't it?

625
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:35,479
Not altogether. It did me a lot of good.

626
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:37,781
Made me see what a stupid ass I've been.

627
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:41,687
Kicked my silly little world
right out from under me.

628
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:46,357
- Will you forgive me, Stella?
- Why, of course, Alec.

629
00:55:47,496 --> 00:55:49,987
- I've never stopped loving you.
- Alec.

630
00:55:50,065 --> 00:55:53,466
Come on. Let's get out of here.
I can't just stand here talking to you.

631
00:55:53,535 --> 00:55:55,833
I've gotta kiss you,
I've gotta put my arms around you.

632
00:55:55,904 --> 00:55:56,700
Alec, please.

633
00:55:56,772 --> 00:55:59,240
You don't know what it's been like,
wanting you every second.

634
00:55:59,308 --> 00:56:01,640
You've never been out of my mind, ever.

635
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,803
I don't care what's happened before,
and neither do you.

636
00:56:03,879 --> 00:56:06,279
We belong to each other.

637
00:56:06,348 --> 00:56:10,250
- But... don't you know?
- Know what?

638
00:56:11,987 --> 00:56:16,720
Well, Charlie and I have been married
for more than a year.

639
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:18,850
Oh, I'm sorry.

640
00:56:19,027 --> 00:56:21,018
I thought you knew.

641
00:56:22,598 --> 00:56:25,863
No, I... I didn't know.

642
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:28,025
Stella!

643
00:56:28,103 --> 00:56:29,229
Down here, Charlie.

644
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,704
- Mr. Dillingham...
- Here's Alec.

645
00:56:31,773 --> 00:56:33,570
Alec!

646
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:35,633
Hello, Charlie.

647
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:37,838
- How are you?
- Fine.

648
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:42,548
Say, you fellas put on
a great show over there.

649
00:56:42,618 --> 00:56:44,711
Yeah, that's what the Kaiser thinks.

650
00:56:44,786 --> 00:56:48,483
I got as far as Hoboken
and they called the whole thing off.

651
00:56:48,557 --> 00:56:52,960
Yeah. I see you've done the songs
for Stella's new show.

652
00:56:53,028 --> 00:56:56,987
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks, but... blame it on Stella.

653
00:56:57,065 --> 00:56:59,397
She cracked the whip.

654
00:57:00,736 --> 00:57:02,931
It's been great seeing you two again.

655
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:06,839
- Well, can't you have lunch with us?
- No, sorry. I, uh...

656
00:57:06,909 --> 00:57:10,037
- I got two fellas waiting out front for me.
- Oh.

657
00:57:10,112 --> 00:57:12,808
- Well, goodbye.
- So long.

658
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:15,111
Goodbye.

659
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:28,328
- Well, he hasn't changed much, has he?
- No.

660
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:31,730
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

661
00:57:32,367 --> 00:57:35,734
What did you say Mr. Dillingham wanted?

662
00:58:01,196 --> 00:58:02,857
Boy, have I been busy.

663
00:58:02,931 --> 00:58:06,492
I got ahold of Jim and Dirk and Reagan
and the others. We're all set for rehearsal.

664
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:09,537
We can use the sample room in
the basement, but that's not the half of it.

665
00:58:09,604 --> 00:58:11,595
Wait till you see the surprise I got for you.

666
00:58:11,673 --> 00:58:13,664
Uh, Jerry!

667
00:58:17,045 --> 00:58:18,034
Hit it, babe.

668
00:58:21,249 --> 00:58:23,683
- What a pair of pipes.
- Jerry Allen's the name.

669
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:24,808
How do you do?

670
00:58:24,886 --> 00:58:27,787
- Wait till you hear her put over a song.
- It'll probably knock you out.

671
00:58:27,856 --> 00:58:30,654
It did all the agents.
Out every time I called.

672
00:58:30,726 --> 00:58:32,057
- Sit down, Jerry.
- Thank you.

673
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:35,858
Well, we're practically set. Alexander's
Ragtime Band back in the running.

674
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:39,128
- Bigger and better than ever.
- What's all the hurry?

675
00:58:39,201 --> 00:58:41,795
What do you mean, what's the hurry?
We gotta get jobs.

676
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:45,033
- Why?
- Well, we've gotta eat.

677
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:47,667
- Why?
- Well... What?

678
00:58:47,743 --> 00:58:50,940
Say, what is this?
Listen, the bankroll is getting thin.

679
00:58:51,013 --> 00:58:53,982
Time enough to worry about that
when it's all gone. Here.

680
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:55,846
Ice?

681
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:57,179
Here, drink this.

682
00:58:57,252 --> 00:58:59,379
- Are you crazy?
- Yes.

683
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:02,252
- Do you mind?
- Certainly not. I'm a little cracked myself.

684
00:59:02,324 --> 00:59:05,691
Oh, there you are.
You see, she understands.

685
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:10,027
She knows that we heroes have to have
a little time to adjust ourselves.

686
00:59:10,098 --> 00:59:13,864
A lot has happened while we've been
making the world safe for democracy.

687
00:59:13,935 --> 00:59:17,371
Oh, cut it. You know very well
those guys won't sit down and wait for

688
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:20,840
you to get in the mood. They'll get
other jobs. Then where'll we be?

689
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:22,900
I'll bite. Where will we be?

690
00:59:22,978 --> 00:59:24,775
Nope, nothing doing.

691
00:59:24,846 --> 00:59:27,974
- Sorry, Jerry, no jobs today.
- Well, that's all right with me.

692
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:31,451
I'll always compromise for a good steak.

that Jerry could put over a song?

695
01:00:25,974 --> 01:00:27,601
That's right.

696
01:00:27,676 --> 01:00:31,908
Well, anyway, it's swell music. It sure has
changed, though. It's got a new rhythm.

697
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,608
- Nice and slow.
- Yeah, like syrup.

698
01:00:34,683 --> 01:00:38,312
- And it's sweet and sticky.
- What do you do with a guy like that?

699
01:00:38,386 --> 01:00:40,786
Oh, just relax
and put your mind on your drinking.

Stop trying to maneuver him
into talking business.

Business? What's that?

702
01:00:45,694 --> 01:00:49,095
You know, the thing you do
to take your mind off your drinking.

703
01:00:49,164 --> 01:00:52,656
- Come on, Alex. Doesn't that adjust you?
- Sorry.

01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:54,964
- Would a dance adjust you?
- Sorry.

Good evening, Mr. Dwyer. Mrs. Dwyer.

708
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:00,795
- Isn't that Bill?
- Looks like him.

709
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:04,334
- Bill!
- Bill!

710
01:02:04,406 --> 01:02:09,002
- My goodness! And he's a father!
- What do you know about this!

711
01:02:09,077 --> 01:02:11,136
Say, what are you doing in New York?

712
01:02:11,213 --> 01:02:14,614
- And out with a baby this time of night.
- Oh, nothing.

713
01:02:14,683 --> 01:02:18,449
Say, how are you folks getting along?
You look fine.

714
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,353
Well, the same to you, Bill.
Let's have a look at him.

715
01:02:21,423 --> 01:02:23,414
- Might be a her.
- Oh, not Bill.

716
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:26,892
- He wouldn't have any feminine offspring.
- I don't think it's much to look at.

Why, I bet she looks just like her...

Oh, why, Bill, it's the image of you!

719
01:02:37,539 --> 01:02:40,702
- How old is it?
- Well, there ain't no way of telling that.

720
01:02:40,775 --> 01:02:43,005
- Imported?
- Yeah. All the way from Hoboken.

721
01:02:43,078 --> 01:02:46,570
Right off the boat. Probably scraped off.

722
01:02:49,184 --> 01:02:51,675
You folks have sure been doing fine,
haven't you?

723

I caught your show, Stella.

You've come a long way.
Right up on top.

01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:59,186
- And your music's all right, too.
- Thanks, Bill.

726
01:02:59,261 --> 01:03:03,391
Don't forget, Bill. You had a hand
in all this, way back in the beginning.

727
01:03:03,465 --> 01:03:06,662
Say, it's funny, ain't it.
You and Charlie over on Broadway

down in Greenwich Village.

- Alec in the Village?
- Sure! Him and Davey.

They got a swell band down at Scarbi's.

731

I got 'em the job. Run across them
once when they was broke.

Come on down sometime when you think
about it. Ask for me. I'm there every night.

to play with the baby, just give me a call.

01:04:07,462 --> 01:04:09,760
I thought they were
going back to San Francisco.

746
01:04:09,831 --> 01:04:11,822
So did I.

747
01:04:22,043 --> 01:04:27,538
What do you say we drop down and see
them sometime, just for old times' sake?

748
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:29,606
Oh, I'd rather not.

749
01:04:30,285 --> 01:04:34,051
Those old times are over and... there's
no use trying to rake them up again.

750
01:04:34,122 --> 01:04:35,987
It never works.

751
01:04:40,929 --> 01:04:43,989
Would you like a highball?

752
01:04:44,065 --> 01:04:45,999
No, just some milk.

753
01:04:46,868 --> 01:04:49,200
All right, I'll get it.

754
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,125
Here you are.

755
01:05:21,202 --> 01:05:24,729
Oh, this is fine.
Make me sleep like a baby.

756
01:05:24,806 --> 01:05:27,240
So will this, if you drink enough of it.

757
01:05:31,513 --> 01:05:33,504
Tired?

758
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:38,885
- I'm all right.
- Come on, Charlie. What is it?

759
01:05:40,922 --> 01:05:45,450
Well... I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

760
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:49,657
Making up a lot of pretty speeches
about marriage, life and fate.

761
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:51,926
Very profound stuff.

762
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,961
But it all seems kinda silly now that
I'm sitting here talking to you like this.

763
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:02,874
Somehow doesn't go with you.
You're too honest and direct.

764
01:06:03,778 --> 01:06:05,712
Come on. Out with it.

765
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:10,407
All right.

766
01:06:12,987 --> 01:06:14,978
Here goes.

767
01:06:16,825 --> 01:06:20,226
What do you say we call this marriage off?

768
01:06:23,631 --> 01:06:27,465
- Charlie!
- Mark it up as... experience.

769
01:06:28,369 --> 01:06:31,600
A grand adventure while it lasted.

770
01:06:31,673 --> 01:06:37,634
But let's not spoil it by beginning to
pretend a lot of things we don't feel.

771
01:06:40,815 --> 01:06:44,273
You're still in love with Alec, aren't you?

772
01:06:45,386 --> 01:06:47,377
Oh, I suppose so.

773
01:06:48,122 --> 01:06:50,522
I thought I was over it, but...

774
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:54,651
Oh, I don't know. I guess you
can't turn those things off and on.

775
01:06:54,729 --> 01:06:56,720
No. Course not.

776
01:06:58,633 --> 01:07:00,624
That's what I'm getting at.

777
01:07:00,702 --> 01:07:03,728
- Oh, but Charlie...
- No buts about it.

778
01:07:03,805 --> 01:07:06,968
I'm a lucky guy
to have had you as long as I have.

779
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:10,101
I'm grateful for every minute of it.

780
01:07:10,178 --> 01:07:12,169
But I want you to be happy.

781
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,342
Now, now, now, now.

782
01:07:21,856 --> 01:07:24,848
Don't go feminine all of a sudden.

783
01:07:24,926 --> 01:07:27,326
Just keep your mind clear.

784
01:07:27,395 --> 01:07:30,296
Go get a nice, quick, cheap divorce.

785
01:07:31,399 --> 01:07:34,368
I'll make the alimony light on you.

786
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:38,132
And if you need any witnesses,
I can arrange that, too.

787
01:07:38,206 --> 01:07:42,233
And you two hotheads
can pick up where you left off.

788
01:07:48,283 --> 01:07:51,047
You haven't left me with a word to say.

789
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,112
That's good.
People talk too much anyhow.

790
01:07:56,157 --> 01:07:59,888
Now will you change your mind
about that highball?

791
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:01,895
Yes, I will.

792
01:08:03,998 --> 01:08:06,228
And a great, big one.

793
01:08:28,559 --> 01:08:31,187
- Hey, Stella!
- Bill!

794
01:08:31,262 --> 01:08:33,696
What do you know about this?
I've been wishing you would show up.

795
01:08:33,764 --> 01:08:35,459
This makes it unanimous.

796
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:39,435
- Hey, you look positively handsome.
- I'm dressed up for the party.

797
01:08:39,503 --> 01:08:42,336
- Party?
- Sure. Come on!

798
01:08:47,111 --> 01:08:49,636
- Stella!
- Davey!

799
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:52,080
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

800
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:55,744
Boy, are you terrific! You look like
you were born on Fifth Avenue.

801
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,846
You look pretty swell yourself.
How've you been, anyhow?

802
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:01,721
Never better. And where's
that old son of a gun Charlie?

803
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:04,761
- I ain't seen him in years and years.
- He's out of town.

804
01:09:04,829 --> 01:09:08,230
Oh, that's a shame. He's the only one
of the old gang that's not here.

805
01:09:08,299 --> 01:09:11,268
Well, come on! This calls for a drink.

806
01:09:11,936 --> 01:09:14,404
Attention, everybody!

807
01:09:14,472 --> 01:09:17,441
Our own personal gift to Broadway,
Stella Kirby.

808
01:09:17,508 --> 01:09:19,738
It's like old home week, isn't it, maestro?

809
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:22,540
Just in time for the celebration.
Won't you sit down?

810
01:09:22,613 --> 01:09:24,706
- Uh, Miss Allen, Mrs. Dwyer.
- How do you do?

811
01:09:24,782 --> 01:09:26,716
- How's Charlie, Stella?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

812
01:09:26,784 --> 01:09:27,773
That's good.

813
01:09:27,852 --> 01:09:30,116
- Stella Kirby!
- Hello, Stella.

814
01:09:30,187 --> 01:09:33,679
- Oh, don't you look elegant!
- Oh, thanks, Ruby.

815
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:35,589
Yeah, Stell, she hooked me at last.

816
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:40,063
I like that! After the way you ran after me
begging me to marry you!

817
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:42,156
- You two are married?
- Uh-huh!

818
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:45,862
Ah, that's what the celebration was for!
Oh, congratulations.

819
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:50,066
That's not the only thing we're celebrating.
We're all leaving for Europe tonight.

820
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:52,905
We're going to Paris and London
and everywhere.

821
01:09:52,977 --> 01:09:56,344
Yeah, we're just getting ready
to get poured on the boat.

822
01:09:56,414 --> 01:09:58,405
- You're leaving for Europe?
- Yep.

823
01:09:58,482 --> 01:10:01,076
One of those horseshoes finally hit us
and we landed a contract.

824
01:10:01,152 --> 01:10:04,019
Oh, that's wonderful.
But it's rather sudden, isn't it?

825
01:10:04,088 --> 01:10:07,387
Well, they needed an American jazz band
in a hurry, and we were just lucky.

826
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:11,485
Oh, lucky nothing!
Why, he's got the hottest band in town.

827
01:10:11,562 --> 01:10:13,553
And you should hear her sing.

828
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:16,495
- You're with the band?
- Yes, I am.

829
01:10:16,567 --> 01:10:20,196
- She took your place. Didn't she, Alec?
- Oh, Jerry's great. One of the best.

830
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:23,297
Yeah, we wanted to make it
a double wedding yesterday,

831
01:10:23,374 --> 01:10:27,504
but Alec was too busy seeing about passports.
Weren't you, Alec?

832
01:10:28,012 --> 01:10:31,345
We almost called the trip off after
we got a look at our passport pictures.

833
01:10:31,415 --> 01:10:34,077
The boys look like gangsters
and I look like a washed-out moll.

834
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:37,245
Say, a couple of friends of mine from
the press want you to give 'em a story

835
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:39,380
about Alexander's Ragtime Band.

836
01:10:39,457 --> 01:10:42,119
Oh, it'll only take you a minute.
They're just sitting right over there

837
01:10:42,193 --> 01:10:44,593
and it'll be good publicity for the speak.

838
01:10:44,662 --> 01:10:45,924
Sure. All right.

839
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:47,930
Will you excuse me?

840
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:50,990
You better hurry and get your drinking
done. We got less than an hour.

841
01:10:51,068 --> 01:10:53,730
Yeah, hurry up, everybody.

842
01:10:54,638 --> 01:10:56,970
- Sorry I missed hearing you sing.
- Thank you.

843
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:59,202
I enjoyed your show very much.

844
01:10:59,276 --> 01:11:01,972
- How long have you been with the band?
- Ever since they started.

845
01:11:02,046 --> 01:11:04,037
In fact, I was one of the charter members.

846
01:11:04,115 --> 01:11:07,016
Then you must have met Alex
soon after he came back from the war.

847
01:11:07,084 --> 01:11:10,076
Yes. He was still in
somewhat of a daze from it.

848
01:11:10,154 --> 01:11:12,679
I stepped in
and sort of helped him snap out of it.

849
01:11:12,757 --> 01:11:15,817
- That was very fortunate for him.
- Yeah, and for me too.

850
01:11:15,893 --> 01:11:19,886
Let me tell you something, Stella.
There's one swell girl.

851
01:11:19,964 --> 01:11:22,660
Why, everything Alec is now,
he owes to her.

852
01:11:22,733 --> 01:11:26,169
You know how Alec is. Moody and funny.

853
01:11:26,237 --> 01:11:29,172
And when he found out
that you and Charlie were married,

854
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,232
well, after all,
that was kind of a sock on the nose.

855
01:11:32,309 --> 01:11:36,712
Why, if it hadn't been for Jerry, he might
have turned into a no-good tramp.

856
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:38,806
But she caught him just in time.

857
01:11:38,883 --> 01:11:41,044
And now look at him!
On his way to Paris!

858
01:11:41,118 --> 01:11:42,915
Compliments of the party
over in the corner.

859
01:11:42,987 --> 01:11:45,217
They wanna know
if you'll sing a little song for them.

860
01:11:45,289 --> 01:11:49,089
- You know that one you did Sunday night?
- I'm on a vacation.

861
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,822
They're big spenders.
They're sure gonna be disappointed.

862
01:11:51,896 --> 01:11:56,765
- Sorry. Not tonight.
- Oh, please do. I'd love to hear you.

863
01:11:56,834 --> 01:11:59,268
- All right, Bill.
- Thanks.

864
01:12:00,638 --> 01:12:03,971
All right, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Get ''Blue Skies'' ready.

865
01:12:05,476 --> 01:12:07,171
Ladies and gentlemen!

866
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:11,112
This little lady, before leaving
for Paris, France and abroad tonight,

867
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:13,446
is going to favor us with a beautiful ballad

868
01:12:13,517 --> 01:12:15,849
one that I know that
you'll all enjoy as much as I have.

869
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,013
And that's saying a lot
'cause I've heard 'em all.

870
01:12:18,189 --> 01:12:23,752
So here goes, folks! The one and only,
the tops, Miss Jerry Allen!

(# ''Blue Skies'')

872
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:38,864
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a great celebrity with us here tonight.

873
01:13:38,936 --> 01:13:40,631
I want you all to meet her.

874
01:13:40,704 --> 01:13:42,934
Miss Stella Kirby!

875
01:13:43,007 --> 01:13:45,498
Sing!
Come on, Stella, sing!

876
01:13:48,445 --> 01:13:50,936
- Come on, Stella.

877
01:13:51,015 --> 01:13:53,540
Come on, come on!

01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:26,711
Come on, everybody sing!

(# ''Pack Up Your Sins
(and Go to the Devil)'')

881
01:16:58,302 --> 01:17:00,031
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stella.

882
01:17:00,104 --> 01:17:03,267
Mac, I'm leaving the show.

883
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:06,832
- You're what?
- I can't continue on.

884
01:17:09,913 --> 01:17:12,541
You're tired.
You've been on the road for ten weeks.

885
01:17:12,616 --> 01:17:15,380
But you're in Chicago now.
We should have a long run.

886
01:17:15,452 --> 01:17:17,511
In another week,
you'll feel like a new person.

887
01:17:17,588 --> 01:17:19,579
Oh, no. It's more than that.

888
01:17:19,656 --> 01:17:23,114
I'm only messing things up
and ruining the show.

889
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:25,627
I just can't stay on, I tell you.

890
01:17:25,696 --> 01:17:28,221
But Mr. Dillingham
has great plans for you, Stella.

891
01:17:28,298 --> 01:17:30,823
You can't throw opportunities
away like this.

892
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:33,927
I'm an old hand at throwing things away.

893
01:17:34,004 --> 01:17:37,531
Stella, this is something that I can't decide.

894
01:17:37,608 --> 01:17:41,544
Mr. Dillingham will have to do that.
You wait here.

895
01:17:42,646 --> 01:17:44,637
I'm going to get him.

896
01:17:45,616 --> 01:17:47,880
(chorus outside sings ''My Walking Stick'')

897
01:18:56,887 --> 01:18:59,412
(# women scat)

898
01:20:10,694 --> 01:20:12,821
(# ''Remember'')

899
01:21:19,496 --> 01:21:21,589
(# ''Everybody Step'')

900
01:23:16,913 --> 01:23:18,881
Gesundheit. I'm gonna take you home,

901
01:23:18,948 --> 01:23:22,281
put your feet in mustard water
and give you a good dose of castor oil.

902
01:23:22,352 --> 01:23:23,444
Over my dead body.

903
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,818
I knew you were crazy
wanting to walk in this rain.

904
01:23:25,889 --> 01:23:30,189
Come on, get out of the wet.
There'll be a taxi along in a minute.

905
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:33,058
Someday I'm gonna
take a good sock at you.

906
01:23:33,129 --> 01:23:35,529
Go ahead. Right on the button.

907
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:40,526
Jerry.

908
01:23:40,603 --> 01:23:42,662
Let's get married.

909
01:23:43,606 --> 01:23:46,166
Have you got a fever?
You sound delirious.

910
01:23:46,242 --> 01:23:49,370
No, I mean it. Now, tonight.

911
01:23:49,446 --> 01:23:53,143
Oh, no, thanks.
You really don't wanna marry me.

912
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,879
You're just trying to avoid the bachelor tax.

913
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:04,383
- Don't you think we'd hit it off together?
- Course. We always have.

914
01:24:04,461 --> 01:24:07,794
- Then why not?
- Because you're not in love with me, Alex.

915
01:24:07,864 --> 01:24:10,389
I used to think you might be, someday.

916
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:13,061
But I was wrong.

917
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:16,628
- You mean an awful lot to me, Jerry.
- I know I do.

918
01:24:16,706 --> 01:24:19,607
But that's not enough to marry on.

919
01:24:19,676 --> 01:24:22,474
Oh, I'm not complaining
and I'm not asking for a thing.

920
01:24:22,545 --> 01:24:24,604
When this is over, it'll be over.

921
01:24:24,681 --> 01:24:28,708
There'll be no weeping at the bar,
as far as I'm concerned.

922
01:24:28,785 --> 01:24:30,776
Just remember that.

923
01:24:32,055 --> 01:24:34,319
You think much too straight for me, Jerry.

924
01:24:34,391 --> 01:24:36,518
Like the rest of you modern, clever women.

925
01:24:36,593 --> 01:24:40,461
Come on, here comes a cab. You can't
talk yourself out of taking that castor oil.

926
01:24:50,006 --> 01:24:53,407
Oh, Mr. Alexander!
May I have your autograph?

927
01:24:53,476 --> 01:24:55,467
Certainly.

928
01:24:57,847 --> 01:24:59,940
It's a shame to bother you like this.

929
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:02,314
It'd bother me a lot more if you didn't.

930
01:25:02,385 --> 01:25:05,047
- Mine too, please.
- Thank you.

931
01:25:08,758 --> 01:25:12,592
Pardon me, Mr. Alexander, but we're ready
when you are for the audition in room B.

932
01:25:12,662 --> 01:25:14,391
Thank you. I'll be right along.

933
01:25:14,464 --> 01:25:16,455
- Whose is this?
- Mine.

934
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:31,976
That's swell. Good comedy, boys.

935
01:25:32,048 --> 01:25:35,040
- But I want a ballad for Miss Allen.
- We've got a million of them.

936
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:37,780
We'll be back tomorrow with a ballad
that'll tear your heart out.

937
01:25:37,854 --> 01:25:39,845
- Thanks very much, boys. So long.
- Thank you.

938
01:25:39,923 --> 01:25:41,254
Thank you. Goodbye.

939
01:25:43,092 --> 01:25:45,253
Will you come in, please?

940
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:53,691
Well, Charlie. You old son of a gun.

941
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:57,968
- Hello, Alec.
- Say, this is great. How are you, anyhow?

942
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:01,238
- Fine. Fine. And you?
- Swell.

943
01:26:01,311 --> 01:26:03,302
Come on. Sit down.

944
01:26:04,514 --> 01:26:07,847
Gosh, I've been reading plenty about you.

945
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:09,976
You must have had all Europe
for a press agent.

946
01:26:10,053 --> 01:26:12,851
Oh, they just happen to like
American music over there.

947
01:26:12,922 --> 01:26:16,449
Don't try to kid me.
I've heard you on the radio.

948
01:26:16,526 --> 01:26:19,051
Good old Charlie.
How are they going, anyway?

949
01:26:19,128 --> 01:26:21,858
Oh, fine. Still pounding them out.

950
01:26:21,931 --> 01:26:24,866
As long as ''moon'' rhymes with ''June,''
I'm OK.

951
01:26:24,934 --> 01:26:27,266
- I guess we're both pretty lucky.
- Yeah.

952
01:26:27,337 --> 01:26:30,898
At least we didn't have to go back
to Dirty Eddie's.

953
01:26:30,974 --> 01:26:35,001
Say, remember the night you played the
concert on Nob Hill and I lost the music?

954
01:26:35,078 --> 01:26:38,377
That was a great night.
Will you wait a few minutes?

955
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:42,145
I wanna talk to you but I got some people
waitin' outside for audition.

956
01:26:42,218 --> 01:26:44,209
- You're auditioning?
- Yeah.

957
01:26:44,287 --> 01:26:47,882
Then I guess you're the fella I'm supposed
to see. I'm one of that few that's waiting.

958
01:26:47,957 --> 01:26:50,050
- Next on the list, too.
- You?

959
01:26:50,126 --> 01:26:53,755
Sure. I got a couple of ballads.
One of 'em's pretty good.

960
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:56,128
- Oh, great. Let's hear 'em.
- OK.

961
01:26:58,735 --> 01:27:01,101
Ah, gee, I'm glad to see you, Charlie.

962
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:03,900
Don't think I'm not glad to see you.

963
01:27:04,774 --> 01:27:07,971
- How's Stella?
- I don't know.

964
01:27:08,044 --> 01:27:12,572
- What?
- I haven't heard from her in a long time.

965
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:15,846
She left town right after our divorce.

966
01:27:15,919 --> 01:27:19,411
Divorce? You and Stella divorced?

967
01:27:21,124 --> 01:27:23,024
Well, sure.

968
01:27:23,092 --> 01:27:25,822
It just didn't... didn't pan out.

969
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:30,924
I... I knew she wasn't
in show business anymore, but...

970
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,903
I thought maybe you and she were leading
a quiet life somewhere and raising a family.

971
01:27:35,972 --> 01:27:38,065
No. Not Stella.

972
01:27:39,676 --> 01:27:41,701
You know how selfish she is.

973
01:27:41,778 --> 01:27:46,374
How unreasonable. What
a double-crossing two-timer she can be.

974
01:27:46,449 --> 01:27:47,814
Now, wait a minute!

975
01:27:47,884 --> 01:27:50,944
Stella's the swellest girl I ever knew.
She never two-timed anybody.

976
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:54,148
- So you're still in love with her, huh?
- Well, what of it?

977
01:27:54,223 --> 01:27:56,214
That's all I wanted to know.

978
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:59,261
Because she's still in love with you.

979
01:28:09,038 --> 01:28:11,029
Same old Charlie.

980
01:28:12,909 --> 01:28:15,002
And you're the same old hothead.

981
01:28:15,078 --> 01:28:17,945
You were gonna sock me, weren't you?

982
01:28:18,014 --> 01:28:20,847
You don't know how close you came
to having your ears slapped down.

983
01:28:20,917 --> 01:28:24,080
Seems to me I've heard those words
before somewhere.

984
01:28:24,153 --> 01:28:28,089
Well, what are we standing here
waiting for? Let's go find her.

985
01:28:28,157 --> 01:28:30,148
I'm sorry I can't help you.

986
01:28:30,226 --> 01:28:34,959
Miss Kirby left the show in Chicago
and I haven't heard anything of her since.

987
01:28:35,031 --> 01:28:37,864
- Thanks. Thanks very much.
- Why don't you try Equity?

988
01:28:37,934 --> 01:28:40,926
- They'll know where she is.
- Thanks very much.

989
01:28:41,004 --> 01:28:43,666
Mr. Alexander,
Mr. Dillingham would like to talk to you.

990
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,731
He has a place for you in his new show.

991
01:28:45,808 --> 01:28:49,835
I'm sorry. I haven't any open time
right now. Perhaps later. Goodbye.

992
01:29:06,095 --> 01:29:08,529
Tickets, please.

993
01:29:08,598 --> 01:29:10,862
Have your tickets ready, please.

994
01:29:35,758 --> 01:29:38,386
- Yes, Miss?
- Does Bill work here anymore?

995
01:29:38,461 --> 01:29:43,626
- Bill? Bill who?
- Bill. Used to be sort of a manager.

996
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,429
- Oh, you mean Bill Mulligan?
- Yes.

997
01:29:45,501 --> 01:29:48,470
- Why, he owns the place.
- He does?

998
01:29:48,538 --> 01:29:53,532
- Could I see him, please?
- Just wait over there. I'll call him.

999
01:30:04,253 --> 01:30:06,244
Stella Kirby.

1000
01:30:07,323 --> 01:30:09,314
Bill.

1001
01:30:09,892 --> 01:30:12,690
Oh, you look positively handsome.

1002
01:30:13,329 --> 01:30:16,992
- Where have you been?
- Oh. Around.

1003
01:30:17,066 --> 01:30:19,694
I've been seeing the country.

1004
01:30:19,769 --> 01:30:21,964
And a very big country it is, too.

1005
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:24,836
- What have you been doing?
- Singing.

1006
01:30:24,907 --> 01:30:28,172
Cabarets and cafés. Anyplace.

1007
01:30:28,244 --> 01:30:30,838
You, Stella Kirby, singing in cabarets?

1008
01:30:30,913 --> 01:30:35,714
No. Lilly Lamont.
I changed my name to fit the personality.

1009
01:30:35,785 --> 01:30:40,017
When I see some of these phonies
making good today and think of you...

1010
01:30:40,089 --> 01:30:43,058
Joe, bring us a bottle of champagne.

1011
01:30:43,126 --> 01:30:47,062
- No, thanks. I feel more at home with beer.
- Just for old times' sake.

1012
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:50,031
- Seen Alec?
- No, I haven't.

1013
01:30:50,099 --> 01:30:53,159
- But you're going to his concert?
- I don't think so.

1014
01:30:53,236 --> 01:30:56,672
He'd be the happiest man in the world if
he thought you was out in that audience.

1015
01:30:56,739 --> 01:30:59,264
He's looked everywhere for you.

1016
01:30:59,342 --> 01:31:02,573
- Just let him think of me as I was.
- Oh, that's silly.

1017
01:31:02,645 --> 01:31:05,170
You're going to that concert with me.
I got a box.

1018
01:31:05,248 --> 01:31:09,241
No, I'm just killing time
until my train leaves tonight.

1019
01:31:09,318 --> 01:31:11,115
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Sure.

1020
01:31:11,254 --> 01:31:13,654
Good. I got something to do,
it'll take me about 20 minutes.

1021
01:31:13,723 --> 01:31:17,090
I'll come back, and you and I will listen
to the concert here, on the radio.

1022
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,924
- All right, Bill.
- Save mine.

1023
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:27,432
- Wish me luck, Aunt Sophie.
- Roger, there's nothing to be afraid of.

1024
01:31:27,503 --> 01:31:29,562
This is something
you've been doing all your life.

1025
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:31,129
Something you believe in.

1026
01:31:31,207 --> 01:31:35,769
Just think how proud Professor Heinrich
and I are of you, darling.

1027
01:31:35,845 --> 01:31:37,836
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1028
01:31:39,582 --> 01:31:41,573
Thank you.

1029
01:31:43,286 --> 01:31:46,255
- Where's Alec?
- He'll be here in a minute.

1030
01:31:46,322 --> 01:31:48,187
- Here he is.
- Well, here we are.

1031
01:31:48,257 --> 01:31:52,717
- It's just like Dirty Eddie's.
- Except the customers have clean collars.

1032
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:55,593
- Well, maestro. It's your night.
- Our night.

1033
01:31:55,665 --> 01:31:57,257
The Three Musketeers.

1034
01:31:57,333 --> 01:32:01,997
We fellas better get out there.
And don't forget to be good.

1035
01:33:22,184 --> 01:33:24,345
Ruby! Ruby!

1036
01:33:27,089 --> 01:33:30,024
- Ruby! Stella's back!
- Stella? Where?

1037
01:33:30,092 --> 01:33:31,821
- She's over at my place.
- Well, why didn't you bring her?

1038
01:33:31,894 --> 01:33:33,691
Don't argue! Now, listen.

1039
01:33:33,763 --> 01:33:37,096
When this concert's over, get ahold of Alec
and tell him to beat it down to my place.

1040
01:33:37,166 --> 01:33:39,819
- I'll hold her there.
- All right.

1041
01:33:41,053 --> 01:33:45,012
When Bill... I mean Mr. Mulligan comes
back, would you tell him I couldn't wait?

1042
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:47,650
Why, uh... Yes, I'll tell him.

1043
01:33:47,726 --> 01:33:48,693
Thank you.

1044
01:34:01,073 --> 01:34:03,007
Taxi, ma'am?

1045
01:34:05,878 --> 01:34:08,005
Taxi?

1046
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,071
I guess so.

1047
01:34:17,156 --> 01:34:19,852
- Where to?
- Anyplace.

1048
01:34:21,026 --> 01:34:24,484
- Just wanna go riding, eh?
- That's right.

1049
01:34:26,565 --> 01:34:29,966
- How about the park?
- Doesn't matter.

1050
01:34:32,638 --> 01:34:35,266
Would you like some music?

1051
01:34:35,341 --> 01:34:36,865
(# ''Cheek to Cheek'')

1052
01:34:41,013 --> 01:34:43,880
- Where's that coming from?
- Carnegie Hall.

1053
01:34:43,949 --> 01:34:46,474
Alexander's Ragtime Band.

1054
01:34:46,685 --> 01:34:48,983
Sure can swing it, can't he?

1055
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,983
You want me to turn it off?

1056
01:34:53,058 --> 01:34:55,049
Oh, no!

1057
01:34:55,895 --> 01:34:59,262
- You may leave it on.

1058
01:35:02,868 --> 01:35:04,699
(# ''Easter Parade'')

1059
01:36:42,101 --> 01:36:44,831
Park's kinda pretty tonight, ain't it?

1060
01:36:44,903 --> 01:36:47,098
Sort of springlike.

1061
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:52,200
- Are we still in the park?
- We're just turning into 59th Street.

1062
01:37:03,122 --> 01:37:05,852
Nice just cruising around.

1063
01:37:05,924 --> 01:37:10,987
You take most fares, always in a hurry,
always wanna get someplace.

1064
01:37:11,063 --> 01:37:14,658
- Sure you ain't tired of this music?
- No.

1065
01:37:14,767 --> 01:37:17,031
Swell music.

1066
01:37:17,102 --> 01:37:20,333
That's where it comes from.
That's Carnegie Hall right there.

1067
01:37:20,406 --> 01:37:22,499
But I didn't ask to go to Carnegie Hall!

1068
01:37:22,574 --> 01:37:27,034
I know, but we gotta get out of the park
some way and this is where we landed.

1069
01:37:27,746 --> 01:37:31,739
Driver, stop here.
I think I'll get out and walk.

1070
01:37:32,718 --> 01:37:35,744
You bet. Nice night for walking.

1071
01:37:45,597 --> 01:37:47,588
How much?

1072
01:37:48,333 --> 01:37:50,801
- One dollar.
- Is that all? Haven't we...

1073
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:53,929
One dollar even. No more, no less.

1074
01:37:55,274 --> 01:37:57,265
- Thank you.
- Night.

1075
01:38:12,758 --> 01:38:17,058
- One, please. In the balcony.
- Sorry, miss. The house is sold out.

1076
01:38:17,129 --> 01:38:20,565
- Then I'll stand.
- No standing room left either.

1077
01:38:20,632 --> 01:38:22,623
Thanks.

1078
01:38:27,973 --> 01:38:30,339
- Ruby, she's gone!
- Who's gone?

1079
01:38:30,409 --> 01:38:32,377
Stella. When I got back
to the place, she'd beat it.

1080
01:38:32,444 --> 01:38:34,912
- Well, didn't you leave anyone with her?
- Yeah, the taxi driver and he's gone, too.

1081
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:36,413
Well, of all the stupid,
clumsy things to do...

1082
01:38:36,482 --> 01:38:38,950
Grand Central Station.
That's our only hope.

1083
01:38:39,017 --> 01:38:43,078
You couldn't find her if you stumbled
over her. I'll attend to this myself.

1084
01:38:48,227 --> 01:38:50,218
Come on. Hop in.

1085
01:38:50,963 --> 01:38:54,729
- No, thanks. I think I'll walk.
- Come on! Come on. Get in.

1086
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,566
You might as well
hear the rest of the concert.

1087
01:39:04,309 --> 01:39:06,470
Taxi!

1088
01:39:06,545 --> 01:39:08,570
- Grand Central.
- Sorry, lady, this cab's taken.

1089
01:39:08,647 --> 01:39:11,115
Oh, for goodness' sake. Taxi!

1090
01:39:11,183 --> 01:39:15,517
You shouldn't have done that.
I could have gotten out.

1091
01:39:17,756 --> 01:39:20,452
I don't feel like driving anyway.

1092
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:24,428
I wanna listen to the music.

1093
01:39:24,496 --> 01:39:26,487
(# ''Heat Wave'')

1094
01:41:35,527 --> 01:41:38,496
Well, looks like that's the end.

1095
01:41:44,303 --> 01:41:46,294
Yes.

1096
01:41:46,371 --> 01:41:48,202
That's the end.

1097
01:42:01,019 --> 01:42:03,351
You can turn the radio off now...

1098
01:42:03,422 --> 01:42:05,413
and drive on.

1099
01:42:07,459 --> 01:42:10,121
I've heard all that I wanna hear.

1100
01:42:10,195 --> 01:42:15,064
You gotta listen to ''Alexander's Ragtime
Band.'' You can't go without hearing that.

1101
01:42:15,133 --> 01:42:17,931
But I don't wanna hear it!
Turn it off, I tell you.

1102
01:42:18,003 --> 01:42:23,270
- Why don't you wanna hear it?
- Because I can't! That's why.

1103
01:42:23,608 --> 01:42:25,633
Ladies and gentlemen,

1104
01:42:25,711 --> 01:42:29,943
we're going to play ''Alexander's
Ragtime Band'' for two reasons.

1105
01:42:30,015 --> 01:42:34,509
One, because I consider it the first,
and best, of all swing songs.

1106
01:42:34,586 --> 01:42:39,523
And second, because it means more
to me than any other piece of music.

1107
01:42:39,591 --> 01:42:41,991
Hearing it may take you back.

1108
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:44,494
Playing it takes me back, too.

1109
01:42:44,963 --> 01:42:48,399
And so, if you'll forgive me,
I'd like to play this song

1110
01:42:48,467 --> 01:42:52,062
not only for you and for the people
with whom you may associate it,

1111
01:42:52,137 --> 01:42:57,370
but also for the people, and especially
the one person, with whom I associate it.

1112
01:42:57,442 --> 01:43:00,002
Did you hear that, Miss Kirby?

1113
01:43:01,213 --> 01:43:04,546
- How did you know?
- Oh, I heard you sing many a time.

1114
01:43:05,584 --> 01:43:09,213
- And you remembered me?
- Sure! You was great. Listen.

1115
01:44:37,409 --> 01:44:38,740
Sing.

1116
01:44:38,977 --> 01:44:40,808
Sing.

1117
01:44:41,305 --> 01:45:41,547
