1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:51,031
It's good to see you, Dick.

3
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,165
It's good to be back.

4
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:57,540
Everything's been arranged.
She's up there waiting for you.

5
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,613
Thank you.

6
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,386
Poor dear man.

7
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:17,423
I... I guess I'll be going now.

8
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:19,500
Good luck to you, Dick.

9
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:37,174
Been through hell, hasn't he?

10
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:39,344
To a man like that...

11
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:41,649
two years in prison
is worse than hell.

12
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,882
Isn't that Dick Harland...

13
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:48,518
the chap who used to live
in Back of the Moon?

14
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:52,366
Yes, I believe it is.

15
00:02:57,872 --> 00:03:02,104
Well, of all the seven deadly sins,
jealousy is the most deadly.

16
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,770
Oh, will you bring us
some coffee, please?

17
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,371
- You were his lawyer, weren't you?
- Yes, I defended him.

18
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:11,043
Some might say
I lost the case for him.

19
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:14,053
I read the newspapers, but somehow
I never could make head nor tail of it.

20
00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:19,286
Well, there were some things that
couldn't be told in the courtroom.

21
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:24,889
Yet, of all the people involved, I suppose
I'm the only one who knew the whole story.

22
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:28,230
You see, it was through me
that they first met.

23
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:31,271
He had been
working very hard on a new book.

24
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:34,575
I invited him up to my place
in New Mexico for a rest.

25
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:37,208
<i>They met on the train.</i>

26
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:11,945
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.

27
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:12,171
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was staring at you, wasn't I?

28
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:15,936
<i>I didn't mean to, really.
It's only because...</i>

29
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:19,342
because you look
so much like my father.

30
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:21,847
<i>When he was younger,
of course, your age.</i>

31
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,578
A most remarkable resemblance.

32
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:28,849
For a moment, I thought...

33
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:32,414
- Do forgive me.
- Well, to tell you the truth...

34
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,722
I was doing quite a bit
of staring myself.

35
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:37,525
And I assure you it's not
because you look like my mother.

36
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,031
As a matter of fact, I can't say you
look like anyone I've ever met before.

37
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,605
- Then why did you stare?
- Do you really want to know?

38
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:48,539
- If it's not too unflattering.
- Now, you know perfectly well...

39
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:51,237
that nothing I could say
about you... the way you look, I mean...

40
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:53,472
could be anything
but flattering.

41
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:56,049
- Of course, if you don't like flattery...
- Oh, but I do.

42
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,746
On second thought, it won't be flattery.
It'll be the truth and nothing but the truth.

43
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:04,552
Any resemblance to flattery
will be sheer coincidence.

44
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,889
- Shall I proceed?
- Proceed.

45
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:11,761
While I was watching you, exotic words
drifted across the mirror of my mind...

46
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:16,235
- as summer clouds drift across the sky.
- Mmm.

47
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:19,170
- Couldn't you be a bit more specific?
- I'll try.

48
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:22,265
Watching you, I thought
of tales in the Arabian nights...

49
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:25,277
of myrrh and frankincense and...

50
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,143
- And patchouli?
- Patchouli, that's it.

51
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:30,217
Wait a minute.

52
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:36,990
I knew it. Here it is.

53
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:39,651
I quote:
"As he watched her...

54
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,695
"exotic words drifted
across the mirror of his mind.

55
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:45,595
"He thought of tales
in the Arabian nights...

56
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,464
of myrrh and frankincense and patchouli."

57
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,867
Unquote.

58
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:53,099
- So that's where it came from.
- Well, I guess so.

59
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:56,438
But really I wasn't... I give you my word.
It's weeks since I read the thing.

60
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:58,512
It must have impressed you enormously.

61
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:00,604
The book?
Not particularly.

62
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:04,515
- Rather a sloppy job, I thought.
- I agree with you.

63
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:08,180
<i>- You do?
- Next stop, Jacinto.</i>

64
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:12,349
Next stop, Jacinto!

65
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,054
Oh, that's me.

66
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,908
Jacinto!
That's me.

67
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:32,542
Oh!
There you are! Hello there!

68
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:35,878
Oh, it's nice to see you.

69
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,178
- Hello, Mrs. Berent.
- Hello.

70
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,946
- Hello!
- Hello, baby. How are you?

71
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:43,182
Hello, Glen. How are you?

72
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,726
- And the children?
- Fine. Wonderful. Charlie, get those bags please.

73
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:49,318
- Oh, we're lookin' forward to seeing the ranch.
- Can you stay long?

74
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,661
<i>Here! Here we are!</i>

75
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:56,168
<i>Hello there!</i>

76
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,364
- Hello, Glen. How are you? Nice to see you.
- Glad to see you, Dick.

77
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,566
- Oh, you look fine.
- How's your brother?

78
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:04,509
Oh, Danny's still flat on his back.
He wanted very much to come...

79
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:07,274
but the doctor thought
the trip might be too much for him.

80
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:11,112
<i>Oh, I'm sorry!
Ladies, may I present Mr. Harland.</i>

81
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,118
- Mrs. Berent.
- How do you do?

82
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,120
- How do you do, Mrs. Berent?
- Ruth Berent.

83
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:17,122
- How do you do?
- Hello.

84
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,124
- Ellen Berent.
- How do you do?

85
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:21,820
- How do you do?
- We met on the train, rather briefly.

86
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:25,092
Too briefly.

87
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,724
<i>I've got the car right here, folks.
You all ready?</i>

88
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:29,803
Come on.

89
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:34,832
- Did you say "Harland"?
- Richard Harland.

90
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:40,745
Oh, Mr. Harland, I'm terribly sorry.

91
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:42,907
I doubt if I'll ever forgive you.

92
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:47,454
- Ruth, wait till you get a look at the new colts.
- Oh, I bet they're darling.

93
00:08:47,555 --> 00:08:50,251
- Ellen, we've got plenty of wild turkey this year.
- Wonderful!

94
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:52,951
Big as ostriches,
twice as ornery.

95
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,723
- Hope you people are all good and hungry.
- Mmm!

96
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:27,626
- Here we are!
- Mom, they're here! They're here!

97
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:30,128
- Welcome to RanchoJacinto.
- Thank you, Glen.

98
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:34,190
- Oh, Mother, isn't this wonderful!
- Oh, it's beautiful!

99
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:38,328
Ruth! Ruth!
Oh, my dear.

100
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,600
Margaret!

101
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,040
Oh, I did want to come
to the train to meet you...

102
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:45,339
but I thought it best to stay here
to supervise dinner.

103
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,812
- Hello, children. How are you?
- Ellen.

104
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:51,043
Dick, it's so good seeing you,
but where is Danny?

105
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:53,950
- He couldn't quite make it this time, Louise.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

106
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,648
- Is he still at Warm Springs?
- Yes. He's getting along just fine.

107
00:09:56,757 --> 00:09:59,317
Oh, good!
You'll probably want to change.

108
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:01,485
Come. I'll show
you your room.

109
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,334
Those trout were in the stream
a couple of hours ago.

110
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,802
- That's something you couldn't get in Boston.
- Perhaps not.

111
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:14,568
- But on the other hand, our codfish...
- I was born and raised in Boston...

112
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:18,736
- and I yield to no one in my passion for codfish.
- I hate codfish.

113
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:21,246
- So do I.
- Children, that's rank disloyalty.

114
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:24,215
- It's treason.
- Mr. Harland, what do you think?

115
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:26,343
Well, Mrs. Robie,
I'm what you call a salmon man.

116
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:30,321
The fact of the matter is
Mother just doesn't like New Mexico.

117
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:34,053
Since this is my first visit to New Mexico,
I don't see how you can say such a thing.

118
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:36,527
It's true just the same.

119
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,827
Father and I used to come here
every spring, year after year.

120
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:43,233
And occasionally
Ruth came along but never Mother.

121
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:47,501
It's too bad Mr. Berent didn't come along
this time. I've been told I resemble him.

122
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:50,406
- Who told you that, Mr. Harland?
- I did.

123
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:52,672
Louise, don't you think so?

124
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,613
- Well, yes, now that you mention it.
- Glen?

125
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:58,947
<i>- Well, in a way.
- In every way.</i>

126
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:02,284
I noticed it the minute I saw him
in the club car...

127
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:05,950
his face, his voice, his manner.

128
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,019
- It's uncanny.
- Well, I must admit you've aroused my curiosity.

129
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,894
If I should get an opportunity
to meet your father...

130
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,696
That's hardly likely, Mr. Harland.

131
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:18,795
- My husband...
- We've come here for my father's funeral.

132
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:24,903
<i>My goodness,
there is a resemblance.</i>

133
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:28,311
Why, a most decided
resemblance.

134
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:32,875
Tell me, what do they mean
about coming here for the funeral?

135
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:35,319
Oh, that was rather
a figure of speech.

136
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:37,890
As a matter of fact,
Professor Berent died some time ago...

137
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:40,256
in the East,
and his body was cremated.

138
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:43,660
They brought the ashes here. They're
having the ceremony in the morning.

139
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:47,825
- Where?
- High up in the mountains, sort of a plateau.

140
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:52,736
A favorite spot of his.
He used to go there a lot with Ellen.

141
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,833
Well, now, if you'll excuse me, I'll see
if the children have gone to bed.

142
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,281
- Hello.
- Hello.

143
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:42,114
- Ellen's gone for a walk.
- How did you know that I...

144
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:44,156
Oh, I'm quite psychic.

145
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:47,523
Oh, and is your sister
psychic too?

146
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:49,653
Oh, yes.
Much more than I am.

147
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:52,459
- Only I'm not her sister.
- You're not?

148
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,830
No, I'm her cousin.

149
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:59,702
I've lived with her family ever since
I was a child. Mrs. Berent adopted me.

150
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:34,573
<i>Good evening, Mr. Harland.</i>

151
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:44,584
In all fairness,
I must confess...

152
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:47,620
the nights here seem more beautiful
than they do at Beacon Hill.

153
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:51,657
Infinitely. I think everything's
more beautiful here.

154
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:58,196
- Ellen has gone for a stroll.
- Thank you.

155
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:35,901
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

156
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:39,063
- Am I intruding?
- Not at all.

157
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:42,734
I... Well, I'm afraid
I owe you an apology.

158
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:46,939
It was rather clumsy of me at the table
to speak of your father.

159
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:51,711
That's all right.
You couldn't have known.

160
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:59,120
You were very close
to your father, weren't you?

161
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:01,751
Yes, we were inseparable.

162
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:06,356
From the time I was able to walk, we were
both happiest when we were together.

163
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,870
Engagement ring?

164
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,837
Yes.

165
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:20,379
Now, I believe
I'd better be going in now.

166
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:22,711
We're getting up at 5:00
in the morning.

167
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:25,910
- Good night.
- Good night.

168
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:49,954
- Don't you think somebody ought to go look for Ellen?
- What for?

169
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:53,123
Well, it's pretty wild country up there.
Perhaps she's lost.

170
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,531
Oh, Ellen knows
her way home.

171
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:58,537
I know, but it's been over 12 hours.
Suppose something happened to her.

172
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:01,540
Nothing ever happens to Ellen.

173
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:11,241
Well, I... I think
I'll take a ride before I turn in.

174
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:38,802
<i>- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. Perfectly.</i>

175
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:42,177
I just wanted to be alone
for a while.

176
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:45,183
- Thank you for coming to the funeral this morning.
- You knew I was there?

177
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:48,413
- Yes, I saw you as I rode by.
- I...

178
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:50,888
I hope you don't think
it was just curiosity.

179
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:54,984
No, I understand.
I'm glad you were there.

180
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:58,394
So am I. I'll never forget it.

181
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:02,264
Father used to say it was like
riding across the front lawn of heaven.

182
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:06,897
We made a pact to bring
our ashes here when we died.

183
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,443
"If you die first," I told him,
"I'll bring yours here.

184
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:14,605
If I die first, you'll bring mine."

185
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:16,706
Yet I know now...

186
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:20,150
people you love don't really die.

187
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,762
Can we go now?

188
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,468
- I'm not a bit sleepy. Are you?
- Not in the least.

189
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,607
Have you forgiven me yet?

190
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:21,909
- What I said about your book.
- Oh, that.

191
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:23,983
I've an altogether
different opinion now.

192
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:27,281
I finished reading your book last night,
and I found it quite absorbing.

193
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:29,355
Well, what made you
change your mind?

194
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:32,425
- I got interested in one of the characters.
- Which one?

195
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:35,927
The author.

196
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:38,691
Well, I assure you the book
is not supposed to be about me.

197
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,790
Oh, but it is,
whether you like it or not.

198
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:44,428
"Every book's a confession,"
my father always said.

199
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:47,132
- Course, you have to read between the lines.
- And did you?

200
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,640
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, what sort of man am I?

201
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:52,803
You're a bachelor.
Thirty years old.

202
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:55,006
You were born and raised
in Boston...

203
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,845
and you went to Harvard
where you edited the Lampoon.

204
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:01,443
When you graduated, you went to Paris
and you studied painting for a while.

205
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:04,649
You have a lodge in Maine
called Back of the Moon.

206
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:07,989
Before you went in for writing
novels, you were a newspaperman.

207
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:11,461
Your favorite sport is fishing, and you
speak French and Spanish quite well.

208
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:13,556
Well, shades of Sherlock.

209
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,726
Do you mean to say you got all that
just from reading my book?

210
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:18,168
Just from reading the dust jacket.

211
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:20,364
It was all there
under your picture, you know.

212
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:23,739
You know, if you'd lived in Salem a
hundred years ago, they'd have burned you.

213
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:27,405
- Why did you give up painting?
- Well, it was like this.

214
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:30,347
I... In the first place,
I discovered I was color-blind.

215
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,715
But since I was interested in post-impressionism,
that didn't matter much, did it?

216
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,879
- No.
- However, when I made the acquaintance...

217
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:39,925
of the boys on the Left Bank, I found
that they lived in squalid garrets...

218
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:42,551
and most of them were
miserably undernourished.

219
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:45,495
Have you ever known
what it was to be really hungry?

220
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,363
- I'm hungry right now.
- Good heavens, you must be.

221
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:50,436
- You haven't had dinner, have you?
- Nor lunch.

222
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:52,903
Well, you poor thing,
you must be famished.

223
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:56,100
- Mrs. Robie told Emily to leave you a tray.
- Good.

224
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:03,571
Oh, there it is! I'll get it.

225
00:22:07,988 --> 00:22:09,956
Let me.

226
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:14,256
Tell me about
your place in Maine.

227
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:17,797
Oh, it's just a cabin,
a shack, that's all.

228
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:20,867
But it's set down in just about
the most beautiful country I've ever seen.

229
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,935
Why do you call it
"Back of the Moon"?

230
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:25,869
Well, there's a lake up there,
shaped like a crescent.

231
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:28,372
Danny and I used to spend
all our summers there.

232
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:31,638
- You love Danny a lot, don't you?
- Well, naturally, I...

233
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:34,111
Is that why you've never married...

234
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:38,150
- because you've had to take care of him?
- No, not exactly.

235
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:40,583
The way I feel about marriage...

236
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:42,655
Well, it's like... Thank you.

237
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:45,418
It's like that trip I made
to Europe after I was graduated.

238
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:49,256
I hadn't the least idea of going abroad.
It just happened.

239
00:22:49,362 --> 00:22:52,593
I was taking a walk with a girl,
and we went down to Boston wharf...

240
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:55,668
and watched a freighter being loaded,
and I liked the looks of her.

241
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:58,260
- The girl?
- No, the freighter.

242
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,396
She looked good to me,
and she smelled good to me.

243
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,907
I didn't even know where she was going,
but I knew I was going with her.

244
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:05,204
And I did.

245
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:10,016
Mmm.

246
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:14,115
Hey, this is about the tastiest
sandwich I've ever eaten.

247
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,654
- What is it?
- Turkey.

248
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:19,316
- Mmm.
- Wild turkey. Ever hunted them?

249
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,020
- No, I haven't.
- It's tricky shooting.

250
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:25,757
They're sort of scary, but they're so
big and clumsy, they hate to take wing.

251
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:28,959
- They're a lot of fun.
- I'd like to try it sometime.

252
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:31,765
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, if Glen has no other plans.

253
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:35,534
- I meant just the two of us.
- I'd love to.

254
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,945
Why did you come for me tonight?

255
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,948
Well, I... I don't know exactly.

256
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,851
Everybody assured me you'd be perfectly
all right. I guess it was just an impulse.

257
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:53,221
- Like the time you took the freighter?
- Yes.

258
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:55,954
You knew I was coming
up there tonight.

259
00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:59,122
You were waiting for me,
weren't you?

260
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,359
Yes.

261
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:04,130
And you came, didn't you?

262
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:08,367
Well.

263
00:24:10,677 --> 00:24:12,872
Good night.

264
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:59,325
Come on.

265
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:24,984
<i>Hello!</i>

266
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:32,214
<i>- What's going on up there?
- I'm just pruning and tying up the roses.</i>

267
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:34,657
I hope I wasn't interfering
with your work.

268
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:37,321
<i>Oh, not at all. I'm glad you're here.</i>

269
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,126
I was thinking about you,
something you said the other night.

270
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:43,760
- What did I say?
- Something rather strange.

271
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,737
You said you'd been adopted
by Mrs. Berent.

272
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,104
Well, what's so strange
about that?

273
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,404
Well, you didn't say
"Mr. And Mrs. Berent."

274
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,776
- Weren't you adopted by both of them?
- Well, yes, of course.

275
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:56,849
<i>- Then, why did you say "Mrs. Berent"?
- I don't know.</i>

276
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,579
I suppose it was
because she suggested that...

277
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:04,680
She was alone
so much of the time, and I...

278
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:08,090
I mustn't keep you from your work.

279
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:15,198
<i>- Be careful.
- Oh, I'm all right.</i>

280
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,307
How's that for an entrance?

281
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:30,712
Perfect.
I'm delighted to see you.

282
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,349
- All of you.
- Thank you.

283
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:39,823
I do hope I've interrupted
you in your work.

284
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:42,224
You have.
Constantly, all morning.

285
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:44,626
But how could I?
I haven't been with you until just now.

286
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:48,690
Oh, yes, you have. I've been
thinking about you and about Quinton.

287
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:52,294
- Who told you his name?
- Glen Robie.

288
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:54,635
- How did he happen to tell you?
- I asked him.

289
00:26:54,741 --> 00:26:57,801
- Why?
- Because I hated Quinton.

290
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,970
- Do you know him?
- No.

291
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,547
- Then why do you hate him?
- Because you knew him.

292
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:05,345
That's nice.

293
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:08,045
You going to hate
everybody I know?

294
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:18,588
You've lost your ring.

295
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,092
No. I took it off
an hour ago.

296
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:26,164
Forever.

297
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:28,934
<i>Come on! Hurry up!</i>

298
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,615
I'll race you across.

299
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:44,924
One, two, three, go!

300
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:53,055
Attaboy, Lin!

301
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,191
Come on, Lin!
Keep it up!

302
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:01,897
Come on!

303
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:04,738
<i>- Lin's going to win.
- No. Ellen.</i>

304
00:28:04,844 --> 00:28:07,506
Ellen always wins.

305
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:21,660
The winner!

306
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:28,192
Don't forget
we have a date after lunch.

307
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,740
Quiet, Chris! Lie down!

308
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,984
What's the matter with you?

309
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,793
- Oh, come in.
- Hello, Robie.

310
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,528
Quiet. Quiet.

311
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:08,536
<i>- Let me take your things.
- Thank you.</i>

312
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:17,247
Here, let me fix that for you.

313
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:39,828
Well, hello.

314
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:42,635
What in the world
brought you here?

315
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:46,234
An airplane. I grabbed the first one
I could catch...

316
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:48,644
after getting
your telegram yesterday.

317
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:52,707
- Why all the rush?
- I wanted to be among the first to congratulate you...

318
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:55,185
on your forthcoming marriage.

319
00:29:55,288 --> 00:29:57,347
Well, we hadn't planned
to announce it for a while...

320
00:29:57,457 --> 00:30:00,688
but since you've let
the cat out of the bag...

321
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:03,284
<i>Darling, this is Russell Quinton.</i>

322
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,431
My fiancé, Richard Harland.

323
00:30:10,203 --> 00:30:12,330
- How do you do?
- Might I have a moment with you alone?

324
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:15,373
Certainly. We can go in the library.

325
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:18,342
Will you excuse us?

326
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:20,912
Mrs. Berent. Ruth.

327
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,519
Dick. Dick, is it true?

328
00:30:35,628 --> 00:30:38,358
- I'm so happy for Ellen, for both of you.
- Oh, thank you.

329
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:42,195
- Well, what I want to know is when and how.
- Well...

330
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:45,429
I'm sorry, Russ. Really I am.

331
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:49,304
I never expected you to come here
in the midst of a political campaign.

332
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:52,572
- When do you plan to be married?
- As soon as possible.

333
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:55,738
Would it be convenient for you
to postpone it until the fall?

334
00:30:55,848 --> 00:30:57,873
Until after election, you mean.

335
00:30:57,984 --> 00:31:01,078
Well, it wouldn't do me much good
for the news to get out that I'd been...

336
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:03,587
jilted and thrown aside
like an old shoe.

337
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:06,055
Oh, come now, Russ.

338
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,153
Surely there's no political significance in
the fact that a lady has changed her mind.

339
00:31:11,264 --> 00:31:16,099
I don't understand it, Ellen. I always knew
you'd never marry me while your father was alive.

340
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:18,227
But after he died, I thought...

341
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:22,433
Well, I thought there might be
a chance. What happened?

342
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,737
I'm in love.

343
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:27,779
We intend to get married at once.

344
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,905
Tomorrow.

345
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:39,181
Don't look so downcast.
I'll still be able to vote for you.

346
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:44,127
Perhaps you don't think I'm good
enough for you or romantic enough.

347
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,256
I know people thought I was marrying
into the Berent family for reasons...

348
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,357
but that's not true.

349
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:52,495
I want you to know
that I had only one reason.

350
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:55,267
I want you to know
that I was in love with you.

351
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,502
I'm not a man who loves often,
and then I love once.

352
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:02,809
Thank you, Russ.
That's quite a concession.

353
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:05,042
I loved you.

354
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:08,780
And I'm still in love with you.

355
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,152
That's a tribute.

356
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:14,317
And I always will be.

357
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:17,021
Remember that.

358
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,793
Russ, is that a threat?

359
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:04,910
Now, look here, Ellen.

360
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:08,447
Darling, will you marry me?

361
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:10,982
Why, you unpredictable little...

362
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:26,722
And I'll never let you go.

363
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:29,767
Never, never, never.

364
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:18,406
Ellen! There he is.

365
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:35,767
Danny.

366
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:40,266
Dick. Dick.

367
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:44,469
Easy, boy. Easy.

368
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:46,545
Oh, Dick.

369
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:50,605
Hey, you've put on weight.
Say, I believe you've actually grown.

370
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:53,344
- You look sort of different yourself.
- You get my telegram?

371
00:34:53,452 --> 00:34:55,852
Yeah, but I didn't
sleep much that night.

372
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:59,118
I just kept thinking, "Now, he's left
the ranch, and now he's in Chicago."

373
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:01,955
I kept seeing that train coming
nearer and nearer.

374
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:05,553
<i>- I counted every turn of the wheels.
- May I come in?</i>

375
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:09,633
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi, Ellen.

376
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:14,798
I hope you like her, Danny. Because
if you don't, we'll send her right back.

377
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,876
Oh, please don't let him fire me,
Danny. I like this job.

378
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:20,343
Don't you worry.
If he fires you, I'll hire you.

379
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:23,074
Thank you.

380
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:25,514
- Were you surprised to get my letter?
- Not a bit.

381
00:35:25,618 --> 00:35:28,178
I knew what was in that letter
even before I opened it.

382
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:30,551
I just kept reading it
over and over again.

383
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:32,920
- Just to sort of...
- Get used to the idea?

384
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:37,826
Yeah. I was trying to picture what kind of
a place Taos was. How long the honeymoon is.

385
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,093
Ellen didn't like Taos.

386
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,760
I thought Warm Springs would be
a much better place for a honeymoon.

387
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:46,235
- Gosh, I hope you can stay a while.
- We're gonna take a cottage...

388
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:48,773
right here
in Warm Springs.

389
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:50,865
- And live here, you mean?
- That's right.

390
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:54,241
That's Ellen's idea.
That's the way she wants it.

391
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:56,315
Gosh.

392
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:03,579
Well, Mrs. Harland. I think I can feel
safe in saying the job is permanent.

393
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:06,624
Thank you, sir.
I always does my best.

394
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:22,432
I trust you'll find the soup
to your taste.

395
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,771
Mmm.

396
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:27,107
It's sheer understatement
to call this ambrosia soup.

397
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:30,205
I call it
consomme a la patchouli.

398
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:32,250
When you get around to hiring
a cook, teach her the recipe.

399
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:36,219
I have no intention of hiring a cook,
housekeeper or any other servants.

400
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:39,120
<i>- You mean, for the present.
- I mean, ever.</i>

401
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:43,457
- Idiot.
- I don't want anybody else but me to do anything for you.

402
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:47,396
I want to keep your house and wash
your clothes and cook your food.

403
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,561
- A born slavey.
- Besides, I don't want anybody else in the house but us.

404
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,400
- Ever?
- Ever.

405
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:57,499
Well, but suppose
in the natural course of events...

406
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,239
<i>- Well, that's different.
- And what about Danny?</i>

407
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:04,077
Well, that's different too.

408
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:08,980
And only three people have
ever been to Back of the Moon.

409
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:11,181
- That's me and Dick and Thorne.
- Who's Thorne?

410
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,693
Leick Thorne, he's a woodsman. He helped
build the house, dam, boathouse and all.

411
00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:20,129
- He takes care of the place.
- I'd like to get hold of some of Richard's baby pictures.

412
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:23,827
- Could I, do you suppose?
- Oh, yeah, there's a whole album full.

413
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:26,962
Lot of college yearbooks
with loads of pictures of him.

414
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:29,370
Only there's one he doesn't like
to show to anybody.

415
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:33,536
- Why not?
- Well, it's got a picture of Enid Southern in it.

416
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:37,207
- Who's she? - She's the one
they voted the best-Iooking girl.

417
00:37:37,316 --> 00:37:40,649
- Was she really beautiful?
- Not as beautiful as you are.

418
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:44,120
Thank you, Danny.

419
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:48,284
Won't it be wonderful when
you can go back to school again?

420
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:50,885
- Gosh, yes.
- What sort of school did you go to?

421
00:37:50,996 --> 00:37:53,055
- Same one as Dick.
- Boarding school?

422
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:55,224
- Yeah.
- Oh, that must be fun.

423
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:57,325
Sure is.

424
00:37:57,436 --> 00:37:59,870
Uh, has Dick been busy lately?

425
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:03,931
Yes, he's been working awfully hard on
his book, and we mustn't interrupt him.

426
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:09,210
Besides, have you forgotten our secret?

427
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,896
Danny!

428
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:36,899
Dick! Dick!

429
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:39,000
Danny. Danny.

430
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,705
Now, we can all three of us
go to Back of the Moon.

431
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:44,180
<i>Can't we, Dick? Can't we?</i>

432
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:48,151
<i>You bet we can. You bet we can.</i>

433
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:55,087
<i>It's way up north,
miles from nowhere.</i>

434
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:58,220
I know all about that place.
I've heard about it plenty from Danny.

435
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,423
He can't wait
to get up there again.

436
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:02,524
I know.
That's my problem.

437
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:04,694
You see, Dr. Mason,
my husband is planning...

438
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,294
to leave for Back of the Moon
as soon as possible.

439
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:09,806
And he wants to take
Danny with us.

440
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:12,434
- So do I, of course.
- What's the problem?

441
00:39:12,545 --> 00:39:17,482
Well, it's so remote up there, wild and
rugged and miles from the nearest town.

442
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,915
The facilities are rather primitive.
There isn't even a telephone...

443
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:22,044
just in case we need
to reach a doctor for Danny.

444
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:25,123
- I'm quite sure he won't need a doctor up there.
- Or medicine or something?

445
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:27,658
- Or medicine or anything.
- What about school?

446
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,160
That can wait.

447
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:33,754
I must say Danny's progress
has been rather remarkable.

448
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:36,960
I don't know how you did it. You must've
practically willed that boy to walk.

449
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:41,733
But don't you see, Doctor? My husband will
be busy a good deal of the time writing.

450
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,970
- And with nobody else around...
- Isn't there somebody with the name "Thorne"?

451
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:49,639
Yes, but he's leaving,
and so it'll be...

452
00:39:49,748 --> 00:39:53,184
I assure you, I don't want
to shirk any responsibility.

453
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,947
I'm thinking only of Danny, and I...

454
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:59,320
No, that isn't true.

455
00:39:59,425 --> 00:40:01,893
I'm thinking a little about myself too.

456
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:06,295
I know you'll understand, Dr. Mason.

457
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:10,164
I gave up my honeymoon to come here so
that my husband could be with his brother.

458
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:12,965
But he's been working,
and the burden's been on me.

459
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:16,303
I've spent hours here, every day.

460
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:19,002
I was glad to do it.
It was no sacrifice at all.

461
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:21,511
I love Danny as much as he does...

462
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:24,879
and I'm just as happy as he is
that Danny's doing so well.

463
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:28,385
But, after all, he's a cripple!

464
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:36,320
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.
- I'm sure you didn't.

465
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:40,558
- I didn't mean it.
- Of course not.

466
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:43,567
I'm afraid I haven't been
too well myself lately.

467
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:46,797
Mrs. Harland,
what do you want me to do?

468
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:48,998
I want you to tell my husband
that it would be better for Danny...

469
00:40:49,108 --> 00:40:52,475
- to stay here at Warm Springs.
- That isn't true.

470
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:54,671
It would be much better
for him to go to Back of the Moon.

471
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,147
But surely it could do no harm for him
to stay here or perhaps go back to school.

472
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,514
<i>- And if you'll only tell my husband...
- Why don't you tell him?</i>

473
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:02,917
Because coming from you...

474
00:41:03,022 --> 00:41:05,286
- Richard.
- Hello, Doctor.

475
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:09,590
Oh, Richard, I've got
such wonderful news.

476
00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:13,495
Dr. Mason has just consented to let
Danny come with us to Back of the Moon.

477
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,531
Oh, no, darling, please. Let me.

478
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:26,110
I want to be the first to tell him.

479
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:29,180
And this is Leick Thorne.

480
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:34,316
Hello? Yes. It's for you.

481
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:40,219
Hello? Oh, golly, Ellen.

482
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:42,384
We're going to Back of the Moon.

483
00:41:42,494 --> 00:41:45,622
Yes, Ellen? When?

484
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:47,756
Tomorrow?

485
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:49,891
Oh, gosh.

486
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:52,436
Yeah?

487
00:41:52,538 --> 00:41:55,405
Gee, thanks, Ellen.

488
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:57,475
Gosh.

489
00:42:57,302 --> 00:42:59,770
Mmm.

490
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:24,555
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

491
00:43:24,663 --> 00:43:27,928
Oh, darling,
I dreamed you were...

492
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:32,002
What gives?

493
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:34,800
Another day with you.

494
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:38,070
Twenty-four hours with you.

495
00:43:44,817 --> 00:43:47,342
Mmm.

496
00:43:47,452 --> 00:43:49,750
<i>- Good morning, Dick.
- Hey, good morning, Danny.</i>

497
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:53,222
<i>- Morning, Ellen.
- Hi, Danny.</i>

498
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:58,194
Hey!

499
00:43:58,297 --> 00:44:02,393
- How about a dip in the lake before breakfast?
- Okay.

500
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,873
- Mornin', Miss Harland.
- Thorne!

501
00:44:12,978 --> 00:44:16,209
- Who gets up first, you or the sun?
- Mostly, it's neck-and-neck.

502
00:44:16,315 --> 00:44:18,943
Tell me if you'd like me
to fix breakfast for you this morning.

503
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:21,679
Oh, no! That's my job.

504
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:24,620
Shucks, I'm gonna feel
sort of like a fifth wheel around here.

505
00:44:24,723 --> 00:44:28,784
You mustn't feel like that. Richard
considers you a part of the place.

506
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:34,363
You must've been especially nice
to him when he was a boy.

507
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:38,459
O-Oh, that wasn't hard.
He was a nice kid.

508
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,902
You must've had
wonderful times together.

509
00:44:41,006 --> 00:44:44,874
- Yep. Ton of'em.
- Did he change much when he got to be a young man?

510
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,241
Ummm, not especially.

511
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:52,045
- Did he used to confide in you a lot?
- Yeah. Sometimes.

512
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,948
Did he ever tell you
about Enid Southern?

513
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:57,317
- Who?
- Enid Southern.

514
00:44:57,422 --> 00:45:00,152
I don't especially recall he did.
Who was she?

515
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:03,160
Oh, nobody in particular, I guess.

516
00:45:03,262 --> 00:45:06,231
Just school stuff.

517
00:45:27,386 --> 00:45:29,752
I'll take those.

518
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:32,847
- Thorne, do you dream a lot?
- Never.

519
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,518
I had the most awful
nightmare last night.

520
00:45:35,627 --> 00:45:37,612
We were out in the skiff, my husband
and I, and he jumped in for a swim.

521
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:39,597
We were out in the skiff, my husband
and I, and he jumped in for a swim.

522
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:41,996
<i>But I was too lazy,
so I just rowed after him.</i>

523
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,002
Somehow, I was afraid, and when
we got to the middle of the lake...

524
00:45:46,104 --> 00:45:48,368
I thought it was time
for him to get back into the boat.

525
00:45:48,473 --> 00:45:53,206
So I decided to call out to him,
but I had no voice.

526
00:45:53,312 --> 00:45:57,214
Suddenly, Richard went under,
not diving but the way seals do...

527
00:45:57,316 --> 00:45:59,546
just sort of settling in the water.

528
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:02,518
Then he came up again,
and one of his arms flung out to me...

529
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:04,782
as if he were trying to call to me.

530
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,826
I tried to row to him, but the lake
was like glue. The boat wouldn't move.

531
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:11,452
<i>My arms were paralyzed.</i>

532
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,690
Then he went down again.

533
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:16,393
And this time he stayed down.

534
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,959
Well, I reckon there's only one way
left for you to save his life.

535
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,131
- How?
- For you to wake up.

536
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,902
That's just what I did.

537
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:29,539
<i>Hey!</i>

538
00:46:49,368 --> 00:46:52,496
- Come and get it!
- Aw, come on in, Ellen!

539
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:55,539
- The water's swell!
- Guess we'd better go in.

540
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,236
Okay, last one in's a sissy.

541
00:48:08,346 --> 00:48:11,679
- Oh, no!
- No, what?

542
00:48:11,783 --> 00:48:15,241
Good grief.
"'Will you marry me? ' he said."

543
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:19,255
- What's wrong with that?
- In the first place, men never propose.

544
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:22,656
- They may think they do, but it's really the woman...
- Who told you that, Ripley?

545
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:25,161
And, if men do propose,
they never say, "Will you marry me?"

546
00:48:25,263 --> 00:48:27,254
Get away.
Get away, gadfly.

547
00:48:27,365 --> 00:48:29,959
- Did you ever propose to a woman?
- Hundreds of'em.

548
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:32,093
When you proposed
to Enid Southern...

549
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:34,172
Who told you
about Enid Southern?

550
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:36,832
- Did you say, "Will you marry me?"
- I didn't propose to her.

551
00:48:36,942 --> 00:48:39,638
- Did she propose to you?
- Beat it, will you?

552
00:48:39,744 --> 00:48:42,508
How did you propose to me?

553
00:48:42,614 --> 00:48:45,674
- Uh, I...
- You didn't.

554
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:47,775
I proposed to you.

555
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,854
Like this.

556
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:56,991
- Remember?
- Okay, I'll marry you.

557
00:48:57,095 --> 00:48:59,393
Right after I finish my chapter.

558
00:48:59,498 --> 00:49:03,298
I hate your chapter.
I hate all your chapters.

559
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:05,562
They take up too much of your time.

560
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,230
- Funny thing, that's what my publisher says.
- No, I'm serious.

561
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,900
<i>After all, it isn't as if
you had to write for a living.</i>

562
00:49:11,009 --> 00:49:13,170
I've got more than enough
for both of us.

563
00:49:13,278 --> 00:49:16,975
- And it's the dearest wish of my heart to support you.
- It's that bad?

564
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:22,886
Oh, darling, I didn't know
it could be so wonderful here...

565
00:49:22,988 --> 00:49:25,718
- Back of the Moon.
- You like it here, do you?

566
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:28,850
Every minute.
If only it weren't so crowded.

567
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,397
Crowded? Why, this is the most remote,
uninhabited place east of the Mojave.

568
00:49:33,498 --> 00:49:37,992
I mean the cabin. Not that
I mind chaperones, not in the least.

569
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:42,403
But there's Danny's room on one side of
us and Thorne's room on the other side...

570
00:49:42,507 --> 00:49:46,841
and the wall's as thin as paper
and the acoustics disgustingly perfect.

571
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:49,038
Well, at least nobody snores.

572
00:49:49,147 --> 00:49:51,274
Do you know, ever since
we've been married...

573
00:49:51,383 --> 00:49:53,681
we've never been alone,
not for a single day?

574
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:56,345
- And do you know...
- And do you know Thorne moved his cot and his things...

575
00:49:56,454 --> 00:49:58,445
- to the boathouse this morning?
- He did?

576
00:49:58,557 --> 00:50:00,582
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, Richard, I hope you didn't tell him I...

577
00:50:00,692 --> 00:50:02,683
Oh, not at all.
It was his own idea.

578
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:05,262
- As far as Danny's concerned...
- Where is Danny?

579
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:08,093
- He went with Thorne.
- Where's Thorne?

580
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,760
- He went to town.
- You don't mean they're gonna stay in town?

581
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:13,861
- Oh, certainly not.
- Then why did they go?

582
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:16,270
- Do you have to know everything?
- Tell me.

583
00:50:16,374 --> 00:50:18,365
- No.
- Tell me!

584
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:20,444
- Cut it out!
- Tell me!

585
00:50:20,545 --> 00:50:23,446
- Stop it. It's a secret.
- You can't have any secrets from me.

586
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:54,576
We wanted to surprise you, honey.

587
00:51:58,043 --> 00:52:00,671
<i>Danny, you sing one. Come on.</i>

588
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:17,021
- What was that?
- Oh, that was a loon.

589
00:52:17,128 --> 00:52:20,188
- There's a couple of'em across the lake.
- They sound horrible.

590
00:52:20,298 --> 00:52:23,859
Oh, you'll get used to it. But wait
till you see the deer. You'll love them.

591
00:52:23,968 --> 00:52:26,095
They come right up
to the cabin to be fed.

592
00:52:26,204 --> 00:52:28,764
- What do you give them?
- Potato peelin's and salt.

593
00:52:28,873 --> 00:52:31,899
- And then, of course, there's our porcupine.
- Oh, yeah.

594
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:35,411
He used to come up every morning
and nibble on the doorstep.

595
00:52:35,513 --> 00:52:39,745
- The Robies paid us a visit at Bar Harbor before we left.
- Are they well?

596
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:43,548
- The children had the mumps.
- Oh.

597
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:47,751
Of course, you've heard about Russ Quinton
being elected district attorney.

598
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:52,353
- Really?
- They say he's got his mind set on the governorship.

599
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:54,432
It wouldn't surprise me
if he made it.

600
00:52:54,532 --> 00:52:56,591
Do you suppose we could
find some wild wisteria...

601
00:52:56,701 --> 00:52:58,965
- and transplant it around the cabin?
- I know where there's some.

602
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,061
Oh, fine. And tomorrow we...

603
00:53:01,172 --> 00:53:04,039
I'm afraid
Thorne won't have time for that.

604
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:06,702
He has his work to do.

605
00:53:09,748 --> 00:53:13,343
Look what I can do.
Thorne showed me.

606
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,728
Oh!

607
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:57,524
After all, Mother, you must remember
Ellen didn't expect us.

608
00:53:57,629 --> 00:54:00,598
We shouldn't have come, Ruth.

609
00:54:00,698 --> 00:54:03,258
We shouldn't have come.

610
00:54:30,261 --> 00:54:32,695
There must be a few loose bricks
in the chimney.

611
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:36,528
I noticed it wasn't
drawing very well.

612
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:43,698
Did you hear me, darling?

613
00:54:43,808 --> 00:54:45,867
What happened tonight?

614
00:54:45,977 --> 00:54:49,174
Ever since Ruth and your mother
arrived, you've been acting like a shrew.

615
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,874
At the landing you were cold,
at dinner aloof and sullen...

616
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:54,417
- and after dinner you were beastly.
- I wasn't expecting guests.

617
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:57,352
- They're your own people, I thought you'd be pleased.
- Don't let's quarrel.

618
00:54:57,455 --> 00:55:00,652
- And Danny adores you. You hurt him. Why?
- I was upset.

619
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:03,022
You were insulting to your mother
and mean to Thorne...

620
00:55:03,127 --> 00:55:05,391
- treated him like a servant.
- Well, isn't he?

621
00:55:05,497 --> 00:55:08,864
Certainly not! He's a friend,
one of my dearest friends.

622
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:11,333
Is Ruth one of your
dearest friends too?

623
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:14,405
- What's eating you? Ruth is your own sister.
- Ruth is not my sister.

624
00:55:14,506 --> 00:55:17,031
All night long,
you devoted yourself exclusively to her!

625
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:19,575
Well, somebody
had to make her welcome.

626
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:25,547
- Maybe you're in love with her.
- You're in a rotten mood, Ellen.

627
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,051
- Maybe that's why you invited her.
- Shh! You want her to hear?

628
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:33,021
I keep forgetting you can't draw a deep
breath without being heard all over the house!

629
00:55:33,124 --> 00:55:36,184
Let's change the name
of the place to Goldfish Manor.

630
00:55:36,294 --> 00:55:40,731
What's happened to you? You're deliberately
whipping yourself into a fit of hysterics.

631
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:46,202
Oh, no, I mustn't do that. It might
disturb Mother and Ruth or wake up Danny!

632
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:56,337
Ellen, what's got into you?

633
00:55:58,216 --> 00:56:00,275
I don't know.

634
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,279
I don't know.

635
00:56:11,896 --> 00:56:15,593
Oh, darling, forgive me.

636
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,635
I'm sorry.

637
00:56:18,736 --> 00:56:24,174
I can't help it.
It's only because I love you so.

638
00:56:24,275 --> 00:56:28,507
I love you so, I can't bear
to share you with anybody.

639
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:45,369
Well, the gal with the hoe.

640
00:56:45,474 --> 00:56:47,908
Oh.

641
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:56,207
Say, you're doing a swell job.

642
00:56:56,318 --> 00:56:59,913
Oh, it's easy here. You just put things
in the ground, and they grow.

643
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:02,957
It's much harder
by the sea where we live.

644
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:06,028
Dick, when are you going
to visit us at Bar Harbor?

645
00:57:06,128 --> 00:57:09,620
- When I finish the book maybe.
- I think you'll like it there.

646
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:12,895
We were talking about it
this morning, Mother and I.

647
00:57:13,002 --> 00:57:15,971
We thought it might be a good idea for
Danny to go back with us when we leave.

648
00:57:16,072 --> 00:57:18,597
<i>The beach is lovely,
and we have a sailboat.</i>

649
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:21,575
<i>He'd have a wonderful time.</i>

650
00:57:21,677 --> 00:57:23,645
I'm sure he would.

651
00:57:23,746 --> 00:57:27,045
There's a school, too,
an excellent school.

652
00:57:27,149 --> 00:57:31,279
Yes, I know.
Ellen told me all about it.

653
00:57:34,156 --> 00:57:36,886
I'll have a talk with Danny.

654
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:18,091
Dick, as far as I've read, it's splendid.

655
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,033
Oh, well, just for that,
I'll dedicate the book to you.

656
00:58:21,137 --> 00:58:25,767
And what shall I say? "To my sweet, to my
beautiful, my discerning mother-in-law..."

657
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,843
"Who advised me to dedicate
this book to my wife."

658
00:58:27,943 --> 00:58:29,934
I'll dedicate
the next one to her.

659
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:32,104
You must dedicate
them all to her.

660
00:58:32,214 --> 00:58:34,614
I hope you'll send me the rest
of the manuscript when it's finished.

661
00:58:34,717 --> 00:58:36,685
There are only a few
chapters to write.

662
00:58:36,786 --> 00:58:39,653
- I'll probably wind it up before you leave here.
- That's hardly likely.

663
00:58:39,755 --> 00:58:41,882
- We're planning to leave on Saturday.
- On Saturday?

664
00:58:41,991 --> 00:58:44,459
But that's preposterous.
You've only been here a few days.

665
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,052
Yes, and they've been wonderful days.
Ruth and I shall never forget them.

666
00:58:48,164 --> 00:58:50,564
But, really, there are reasons
why I must be getting home.

667
00:58:50,666 --> 00:58:53,499
- Does Ellen know you're leaving?
- I told her this morning.

668
00:58:53,602 --> 00:58:56,469
Now, don't look so downcast, Dick.

669
00:58:56,572 --> 00:58:58,699
You know, in a way,
mothers-in-law are like children.

670
00:58:58,808 --> 00:59:00,901
They should be seen
and not heard.

671
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,638
And not seen too much.

672
00:59:03,746 --> 00:59:05,737
What's wrong with Ellen?

673
00:59:05,848 --> 00:59:08,009
There's nothing wrong with Ellen.

674
00:59:08,117 --> 00:59:10,915
It's just that she loves too much.

675
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,820
Perhaps that isn't good.
It makes outsiders of everyone else.

676
00:59:14,924 --> 00:59:17,518
But she can't help it.

677
00:59:17,626 --> 00:59:20,220
You must be patient with her.

678
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:23,992
She loved her father too much.

679
01:00:34,937 --> 01:00:39,306
- Please, Danny, sit still. How do you expect me...
- I can't help it. It tickles.

680
01:00:45,514 --> 01:00:47,778
You'll just love our house by the sea.

681
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:50,511
There are a lot of rocks on one side
of the beach, and, when it's low tide...

682
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:54,111
you can go there and watch
the anemones and the ink squids.

683
01:00:54,223 --> 01:00:58,284
And there are the most wonderful
shells and pebbles... all sizes and colors.

684
01:00:58,394 --> 01:01:00,589
Sounds swell.

685
01:01:00,696 --> 01:01:02,926
Hold still.

686
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:06,524
How would you like to go
to Bar Harbor for a while?

687
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:11,095
- I had a letter from Ruth, and she'd love to have you.
- I'd love to go.

688
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:13,436
- With Dick, you mean.
- Well, no.

689
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:16,511
He doesn't want to leave here until the new
book's finished, and then we can join you.

690
01:01:16,612 --> 01:01:21,675
Oh, I'd... I'd rather wait then until
we can all go together, the three of us.

691
01:01:21,784 --> 01:01:25,618
We wouldn't be separated
for long, just a few weeks.

692
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:28,417
No. I'd... I'd rather wait.

693
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:44,469
Can I swim all the way across today?

694
01:01:44,573 --> 01:01:46,632
- Think you can make it?
- Why, sure.

695
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:49,472
I made it three-quarters
yesterday, and I wasn't a bit tired.

696
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:52,877
- All right.
- If I make it today, can we show Dick tomorrow?

697
01:01:52,982 --> 01:01:55,678
- Yes. Tomorrow.
- And we don't have to tell him...

698
01:01:55,784 --> 01:01:58,753
- how long I've been practicing, do we?
- No.

699
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:01,823
We can just pretend that you decided
to do it on the spur of the moment.

700
01:02:01,924 --> 01:02:05,758
<i>Yeah. That's what we'll do. You know,
I can just see him watching now.</i>

701
01:02:05,861 --> 01:02:08,762
After a while, he'll say, "That's enough,
Danny. Better get back in the boat now."

702
01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:11,765
<i>And I'll just pretend like I didn't
hear him and keep right on goin.</i>

703
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:14,563
<i>- Are you ready?
- Ready.</i>

704
01:02:49,138 --> 01:02:52,471
- Think you can make it, Danny?
- Aw, it's a cinch.

705
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,906
Don't worry about your direction.

706
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,069
I'll keep you on your course.

707
01:02:57,179 --> 01:02:59,204
Okay.

708
01:03:20,035 --> 01:03:22,094
Are we halfway to the point yet?

709
01:03:22,204 --> 01:03:24,229
Not yet.

710
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:36,313
You're not making
very much progress, Danny.

711
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:52,997
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little winded.

712
01:03:53,102 --> 01:03:56,538
I had a kink in my side,
but it's gone now.

713
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:59,334
- You'd better float for a while.
- Yeah.

714
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:10,710
I... I think I'm gettin' tired.

715
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:13,287
Take it easy.

716
01:04:13,388 --> 01:04:16,016
You don't want to give up
when you've come so far.

717
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:19,288
Okay.
I'll get my second wind in a minute.

718
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:34,732
The wa... water's cold...

719
01:04:34,843 --> 01:04:37,311
colder than I thought.

720
01:04:37,412 --> 01:04:39,903
I ate too much lunch.

721
01:04:41,116 --> 01:04:43,710
<i>I got a stomachache. Ellen!</i>

722
01:04:43,819 --> 01:04:47,152
It's... It's a cramp.

723
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:49,451
Ellen! It's a cramp!

724
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:58,095
<i>Ellen! Ellen!</i>

725
01:04:59,368 --> 01:05:01,427
Help me!

726
01:05:22,558 --> 01:05:26,016
<i>Danny! Danny!</i>

727
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,768
Danny!

728
01:07:59,715 --> 01:08:01,774
I've been cleaning
Father's laboratory.

729
01:08:01,883 --> 01:08:03,942
I thought it might be
a good place for Dick to work.

730
01:08:04,052 --> 01:08:06,577
He's dropped his work.

731
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:09,521
He's dropped everything.

732
01:08:09,624 --> 01:08:13,185
I'm losing him, Ruth.
I'll die if I lose him.

733
01:08:19,401 --> 01:08:22,768
Perhaps... Perhaps
if you went back to the lodge...

734
01:08:22,871 --> 01:08:24,930
just the two of you.

735
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,441
No. He hates it now,
everything about it.

736
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,740
He never wants
to set foot there again.

737
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:33,872
And he doesn't want
to go back to Boston.

738
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,780
If I only knew
what he was thinking.

739
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:43,214
You've always helped me, Ruth.

740
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,725
Help me now.

741
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:49,956
A little time, Ellen. You'll see.

742
01:08:50,065 --> 01:08:54,001
He's had a great loss.
There's a great emptiness in his life.

743
01:08:54,102 --> 01:08:57,731
If he only...
If he only had a child of his own.

744
01:09:20,295 --> 01:09:22,593
<i>Oh, it's wonderful.
When Ellen was a little girl...</i>

745
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:24,790
her father fixed this room up
as a playroom for her.

746
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,095
Then when she grew up,
he used it as a laboratory.

747
01:09:27,202 --> 01:09:30,262
Now it's going to be a playroom again,
just as it was before.

748
01:09:30,372 --> 01:09:33,102
Not exactly, Mother. Your baby
was a girl. Ours is going to be a boy.

749
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:36,268
<i>- Oh, you've decided that, have you?
- Oh, definitely.</i>

750
01:09:36,378 --> 01:09:38,846
Ellen gave me her word of honor.
Stand still, will you?

751
01:09:38,947 --> 01:09:43,179
- I've got a kink in my neck.
- Dotted swiss would be nice for the curtains.

752
01:09:43,285 --> 01:09:46,015
- What about the rug?
- You don't put rugs in children's playrooms.

753
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:48,180
- You use linoleum.
- Why?

754
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,451
Linoleum washes easily,
just in case.

755
01:09:53,462 --> 01:09:55,555
Say, you women
think of everything, don't you?

756
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:59,532
- All right, you can rest.
- Oh.

757
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:09,542
Mm.

758
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:17,015
Ellen, you shouldn't have
walked up those stairs.

759
01:10:17,118 --> 01:10:20,519
- You know what the doctor told you.
- Darling, come here and sit down.

760
01:10:20,622 --> 01:10:22,681
What have you done
with Father's lab?

761
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:24,850
We didn't want you
to see it till it was finished.

762
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,758
- What have you done with his things?
- We stored them in the basement.

763
01:10:27,863 --> 01:10:32,857
- Why didn't you consult me?
- We wanted to surprise you. It's an ideal place for a playroom.

764
01:10:32,968 --> 01:10:37,064
But I didn't want the room changed ever.
I wanted it left just as it was.

765
01:10:37,172 --> 01:10:40,699
I know you don't like being surprised,
but we were only trying to please you.

766
01:10:40,809 --> 01:10:44,006
Come on, darling.
Everything's so wonderful now.

767
01:10:44,112 --> 01:10:46,137
Oh.

768
01:10:55,857 --> 01:10:57,916
Patchouli.

769
01:11:06,535 --> 01:11:09,368
Hmm. You'll have
to behave yourself.

770
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:11,769
Imagine eating shrimps
at a time like this.

771
01:11:11,873 --> 01:11:13,932
- Where's Richard?
- He went to town.

772
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:16,533
They always upset you.
I've been telling you that for years.

773
01:11:16,645 --> 01:11:18,772
<i>- Did Ruth go with him?
- Yes, I think so.</i>

774
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,906
<i>- And especially now, in your condition.
- When did they leave?</i>

775
01:11:22,017 --> 01:11:26,113
- Right after lunch.
- And another thing... don't try to be so blamed athletic.

776
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:28,655
- What time is it, Mother?
- Almost 5:00.

777
01:11:28,757 --> 01:11:32,124
- You've gotta stop gadding about.
- "Gadding"?

778
01:11:32,227 --> 01:11:35,924
What are you talking about?
This baby's making a prisoner out of me.

779
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:39,990
- What are you having it for then?
- I can't do anything. I can't go anyplace.

780
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:43,229
- I don't even see my husband.
- Why don't you have him come in here?

781
01:11:43,338 --> 01:11:47,468
- Because I don't want him to see me this way.
- That doesn't make sense.

782
01:11:47,576 --> 01:11:52,013
Those are orders now...
no shrimps, no stairs.

783
01:11:52,113 --> 01:11:54,206
And don't you budge
off that couch.

784
01:12:38,293 --> 01:12:40,659
- Hey!
- Oh! Oh!

785
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:44,027
- Get those, Ruth!
- Oh! Oh, heavens!

786
01:12:51,306 --> 01:12:55,037
- Hey!
- Oh!

787
01:13:05,854 --> 01:13:08,755
- There.
- What are you doing?

788
01:13:11,793 --> 01:13:14,921
You look so funny. You should
always wear your hat like that.

789
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:30,804
I missed you this afternoon.

790
01:13:33,948 --> 01:13:36,041
What did you do
when you went to town?

791
01:13:36,151 --> 01:13:38,847
Oh, we just shopped around
for the baby things.

792
01:13:38,953 --> 01:13:41,012
You were gone about four hours.

793
01:13:41,122 --> 01:13:43,590
Well, we walked to town and back.

794
01:13:43,692 --> 01:13:47,093
Rather a long walk, isn't it?

795
01:13:47,195 --> 01:13:49,459
Tell me.
What did you talk about?

796
01:13:49,564 --> 01:13:51,930
Oh, a lot of things.

797
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:55,196
- About Danny?
- No.

798
01:13:56,337 --> 01:13:59,465
- About me.
- Not especially.

799
01:14:00,809 --> 01:14:03,539
You're looking very well, Ruth.

800
01:14:03,645 --> 01:14:06,705
I've never seen you so happy.

801
01:14:06,815 --> 01:14:09,978
Tell me. Do you think
Richard loves me?

802
01:14:10,085 --> 01:14:12,417
Well, now that's a silly thing to say.

803
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,216
Oh, I know,
in the beginning, he loved me.

804
01:14:15,323 --> 01:14:19,783
But I'll tell you something funny.
He never liked me.

805
01:14:19,894 --> 01:14:23,557
- He loved you but he never liked you?
- That's right.

806
01:14:23,665 --> 01:14:26,657
We've never really been
friends like you and he.

807
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:29,293
He likes you.

808
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:32,271
Tell me. Has he found
a nickname for you yet?

809
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:35,831
Well, not exactly. Sometimes
he calls me the gal with the hoe...

810
01:14:35,944 --> 01:14:38,777
to kid me about my gardening.

811
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,905
He used to call me Patchouli.

812
01:14:51,893 --> 01:14:54,418
Look at me.

813
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:58,829
- I hate the little beast. I wish it would die.
- Ellen.

814
01:15:00,769 --> 01:15:04,796
Shocked, aren't you? If you were
having the baby, you'd love it.

815
01:15:04,906 --> 01:15:06,965
Well, I never wanted it.

816
01:15:07,075 --> 01:15:10,169
Richard and I never
needed anything else.

817
01:15:10,278 --> 01:15:13,679
<i>- And now this.
- How can you say such wicked things?</i>

818
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:20,051
<i>Sometimes the truth is wicked.</i>

819
01:15:20,155 --> 01:15:24,888
- You're afraid of the truth, aren't you, Ruth?
- No.

820
01:15:24,993 --> 01:15:27,052
You're the one who's afraid.

821
01:18:19,901 --> 01:18:21,698
<i>Ellen!</i>

822
01:18:28,643 --> 01:18:30,702
Call the doctor.

823
01:18:35,516 --> 01:18:37,711
- What happened?
- She must have tripped.

824
01:18:37,819 --> 01:18:40,686
Hello? Dr. Saunders,
this is Ruth Berent.

825
01:18:40,788 --> 01:18:43,484
Yes, please come over at once.
Something terrible has happened.

826
01:18:56,671 --> 01:18:58,901
Well, we couldn't save the child.

827
01:18:59,007 --> 01:19:01,066
<i>It was a boy.</i>

828
01:19:02,877 --> 01:19:08,042
I... I hadn't really hoped...
As long as she's out of danger.

829
01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:10,743
Oh, yes, you may rest
assured of that.

830
01:19:10,852 --> 01:19:14,049
When she came to, she remembered
nothing about leaving her room.

831
01:19:14,155 --> 01:19:17,090
She thought she must have been
walking in her sleep.

832
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:20,718
She couldn't have been asleep. I was with
her only 20 minutes before it happened.

833
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:23,353
You can go in and see her
for a moment if you like.

834
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:31,262
First his brother... and now his son.

835
01:20:12,013 --> 01:20:14,811
Yes?

836
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:17,510
No, she's not here at the moment.

837
01:20:17,618 --> 01:20:19,813
I'd be glad to take a message.

838
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:31,923
Yes, I will.

839
01:20:40,475 --> 01:20:42,705
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

840
01:20:44,212 --> 01:20:46,680
Ruthie, my lass, the surf was wonderful.

841
01:20:46,781 --> 01:20:49,181
<i>You should've come in for a dip.</i>

842
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:53,720
- Too cold for me.
- You're a softie. You always were.

843
01:20:58,626 --> 01:21:01,959
Mmm! Richard's new book.

844
01:21:02,063 --> 01:21:04,088
Nice.

845
01:21:13,908 --> 01:21:17,366
- Where is everybody?
- Dick's gone for a walk. Mother's in her room.

846
01:21:17,478 --> 01:21:20,914
I'm worried about Mother these days,
the way she keeps to her room.

847
01:21:21,015 --> 01:21:23,882
- Isn't she well?
- Perfectly well.

848
01:21:23,985 --> 01:21:27,318
<i>Then why do you suppose
she insists on acting like a hermit?</i>

849
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:29,548
- Why don't you ask her?
- She won't talk to me.

850
01:21:29,657 --> 01:21:31,921
I can't imagine
what's come over her.

851
01:21:32,026 --> 01:21:34,517
Oh, by the way.
That phone call was for you.

852
01:21:34,629 --> 01:21:36,756
Somebody from
the travel bureau in town.

853
01:21:36,864 --> 01:21:40,664
Said it was all right about
the transportation and hotel reservation.

854
01:21:40,768 --> 01:21:43,236
Who's going places, and where?

855
01:21:43,337 --> 01:21:45,396
I am. Mexico.

856
01:21:47,975 --> 01:21:51,035
Well, why the wanderlust
all of a sudden?

857
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:55,514
- I just thought I'd like to get away for a while.
- From what?

858
01:21:55,616 --> 01:21:58,551
Is there anything so strange
about my wanting to take a trip?

859
01:21:58,653 --> 01:22:02,111
No, I suppose not, but why Mexico?

860
01:22:02,223 --> 01:22:04,589
I've always wanted to see Mexico.

861
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:07,422
I've never heard you
say anything about it before.

862
01:22:07,528 --> 01:22:10,429
- What part of Mexico?
- Taxco.

863
01:22:13,868 --> 01:22:16,029
- When are you going?
- Next week.

864
01:22:16,137 --> 01:22:18,196
- With Mother?
- No.

865
01:22:18,306 --> 01:22:21,707
- By yourself?
- By myself.

866
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:25,301
What are you running away from?
Is it me?

867
01:22:25,413 --> 01:22:29,577
Ellen, when we were kids, you used to
torment me every way you could think of.

868
01:22:29,684 --> 01:22:32,380
- You can't do that anymore.
- Is it Richard?

869
01:22:32,486 --> 01:22:36,149
If you must know, I'm going away because I
can't stand living in this house any longer.

870
01:22:36,257 --> 01:22:38,953
The whole place is filled
with hate... your hate.

871
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,824
Not hate. Love, Ruth.
Richard's love for me.

872
01:22:41,929 --> 01:22:44,090
All these weeks, I was
in the hospital helpless.

873
01:22:44,198 --> 01:22:46,393
You had him here
in the house to yourself.

874
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,559
But it didn't do you
any good, did it?

875
01:22:48,669 --> 01:22:50,728
He still loves me.
He loves me more than ever.

876
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:52,999
That's what you can't abide.
That's why you envy me, isn't it?

877
01:22:53,107 --> 01:22:55,268
I don't envy you, Ellen.

878
01:22:55,376 --> 01:22:58,174
All my life, I've tried to love you,
done everything to please you.

879
01:22:58,279 --> 01:23:00,509
All of us have...
Mother, Father and now Richard.

880
01:23:00,615 --> 01:23:03,311
And what have you done?
With your love, you wrecked Mother's life.

881
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:05,476
With your love,
you pressed Father to death.

882
01:23:05,586 --> 01:23:07,645
With your love,
you've made a shadow of Richard.

883
01:23:07,755 --> 01:23:10,519
No, Ellen, I don't envy you.

884
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,684
I'm sorry for you.

885
01:23:12,793 --> 01:23:15,489
You're the most pitiful creature
I've ever known.

886
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:35,707
Hello, Richard.

887
01:23:35,816 --> 01:23:37,875
Have a nice walk?

888
01:23:37,985 --> 01:23:42,115
You haven't shaved, darling,
but I'll forgive you.

889
01:23:42,223 --> 01:23:44,851
Your new book just came.
I've been glancing through it.

890
01:23:44,959 --> 01:23:49,055
I noticed the dedication...
"To the Gal with the Hoe."

891
01:23:49,163 --> 01:23:52,064
I'd hoped it would be
"To Patchouli."

892
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:55,101
But I suppose she did
help you with it a lot.

893
01:23:57,104 --> 01:24:01,507
Oh, well, there'll be other books.

894
01:24:01,609 --> 01:24:05,841
Darling, I had no idea
the setting of your book was Mexico.

895
01:24:05,946 --> 01:24:08,414
I didn't even know
you'd been there.

896
01:24:08,516 --> 01:24:10,575
Why didn't you tell me?

897
01:24:18,192 --> 01:24:20,251
Is anything wrong, Richard?

898
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:22,795
<i>You look so strange.</i>

899
01:24:25,866 --> 01:24:28,061
You've been avoiding me...

900
01:24:28,169 --> 01:24:31,195
going off by yourself.

901
01:24:31,305 --> 01:24:33,535
Where do you go?

902
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:35,871
What do you think about?

903
01:24:35,976 --> 01:24:39,275
Whatever it is,
can't you share it with me?

904
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:42,076
We haven't done that
for a long time... share things.

905
01:24:42,183 --> 01:24:44,242
Ever since Danny...

906
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:50,783
You've never forgiven me
for that, have you?

907
01:24:54,195 --> 01:24:56,789
You've always blamed me.

908
01:24:56,897 --> 01:25:00,298
You did tell me not to let him swim
the lake unless you were with us, but...

909
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:02,699
but we wanted to surprise you.

910
01:25:02,803 --> 01:25:05,465
Danny was so happy
planning to surprise you.

911
01:25:05,573 --> 01:25:07,734
He'd been doing so well. He swam
three-quarters the day before...

912
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:09,867
and he was sure
he could make it.

913
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:14,038
The water was so warm.
I thought there was no danger.

914
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:17,811
I must have looked away for a moment, and
then, when I looked back, Danny was sinking.

915
01:25:17,918 --> 01:25:21,479
I pulled at the oars
and then lost one.

916
01:25:21,589 --> 01:25:24,854
And then I grew panicky.
It was like a nightmare!

917
01:25:26,193 --> 01:25:28,286
Like... walking in your sleep?

918
01:25:29,997 --> 01:25:32,124
Yes.

919
01:25:32,233 --> 01:25:36,294
Yes. I began to paddle,
and the boat didn't seem to move.

920
01:25:36,404 --> 01:25:40,340
So you let him drown,
didn't you?

921
01:25:42,743 --> 01:25:46,474
- Didn't you?
- Richard, you're hurting me.

922
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:49,140
What happened that day
at Back of the Moon?

923
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,309
You got rid of everybody else...

924
01:25:51,419 --> 01:25:53,614
your mother, Ruth, Thorne.

925
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:57,350
There was only Danny left.
What were you thinking of?

926
01:25:57,458 --> 01:26:00,154
You never really cared for him.
You only pretended to.

927
01:26:00,261 --> 01:26:02,320
What happened?
Did he refuse to leave?

928
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:05,593
- Don't, Richard. Don't.
- Was that why you killed him?

929
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:08,293
- I didn't mean to let him drown.
- But you did, didn't you?

930
01:26:08,402 --> 01:26:11,132
You're a perfect swimmer,
and the boat was so far away...

931
01:26:11,238 --> 01:26:13,468
and he was going down
for the third time.

932
01:26:13,574 --> 01:26:16,839
You killed him.
You let Danny drown, didn't you?

933
01:26:16,944 --> 01:26:19,208
- Didn't you?
- Yes. Yes, I did.

934
01:26:19,313 --> 01:26:21,372
I let him drown,
and I'd do it again.

935
01:26:21,482 --> 01:26:24,178
I didn't want him around.
I didn't want anyone but you.

936
01:26:30,458 --> 01:26:33,484
I knew it.

937
01:26:33,594 --> 01:26:36,688
I must have known it all along.

938
01:26:36,797 --> 01:26:39,129
I kept pushing it out of my mind.

939
01:26:40,768 --> 01:26:42,793
I couldn't believe it.

940
01:26:44,138 --> 01:26:46,572
I didn't want to believe it.

941
01:26:46,674 --> 01:26:49,336
How could I?

942
01:26:49,443 --> 01:26:53,379
You loved me, you said,
wanted only to make me happy.

943
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:57,884
Yes. Yes, that was all I ever wanted,
Richard... your happiness, only that.

944
01:26:57,985 --> 01:27:00,044
I didn't mean to let Danny drown.

945
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:02,384
I didn't plan it. I swear I didn't.

946
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:04,856
But when the cramp caught him and he went
under, I thought, if he never came up again...

947
01:27:04,959 --> 01:27:07,018
I'd have you all to myself.

948
01:27:07,127 --> 01:27:09,391
I thought, if he was gone,
you'd have only me.

949
01:27:09,497 --> 01:27:11,988
Then suddenly, while I was thinking that,
he was gone.

950
01:27:12,099 --> 01:27:14,761
I was sorry then and frightened,
and I tried to find him.

951
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:18,703
Tried, honestly, tried hard,
but it was too late.

952
01:27:18,806 --> 01:27:20,865
Why don't you kill me, Richard?

953
01:27:20,975 --> 01:27:23,205
You could so easily, you know.

954
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:26,211
And the baby.

955
01:27:26,313 --> 01:27:28,372
You never wanted it, did you?

956
01:27:28,482 --> 01:27:32,441
No. Oh, don't you see, Richard?
I didn't want anyone around, only you.

957
01:27:32,553 --> 01:27:36,421
I wanted to be just with you.
I couldn't stand having anyone between us.

958
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:38,617
Oh, I love you so, Richard.

959
01:27:38,726 --> 01:27:41,354
I love you so.

960
01:27:41,462 --> 01:27:43,487
I'm leaving you, Ellen.

961
01:28:35,115 --> 01:28:37,447
Mr...

962
01:28:37,551 --> 01:28:39,576
Russell...

963
01:28:40,888 --> 01:28:42,913
Quinton...

964
01:28:45,426 --> 01:28:48,156
District...

965
01:28:48,262 --> 01:28:50,321
Attorney...

966
01:28:52,232 --> 01:28:54,257
Sussex...

967
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:06,739
<i>Flight 17, the Sunset Special...</i>

968
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,104
<i>now loading at Gate Seven.</i>

969
01:30:14,815 --> 01:30:18,410
<i>Mr. Richard Harland
wanted at the telephone.</i>

970
01:30:18,519 --> 01:30:20,646
<i>Inquire at Information.</i>

971
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:26,351
- I'm Richard Harland.
- Use the phone number one.

972
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,485
Thank you.

973
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,894
Hello.

974
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:38,301
Yes, this is... Oh, hello.

975
01:30:41,842 --> 01:30:43,867
What?

976
01:30:45,079 --> 01:30:47,104
Well, how... How did it happen?

977
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:53,516
Oh, yes, of course.
I'll take the first train back.

978
01:31:05,766 --> 01:31:08,326
Dr. Saunders, I'm sorry to get
you out of bed, but she's much worse.

979
01:31:08,435 --> 01:31:11,666
Would you hold on
for just a minute, please?

980
01:31:17,111 --> 01:31:19,978
Oh, Dick.

981
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,344
- Where is she?
- In her room.

982
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:26,909
It happened very suddenly. We
were having a picnic lunch at the beach.

983
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,955
Doctor, it seems to be more
serious than you thought.

984
01:31:30,057 --> 01:31:32,821
Could you come
at once, please?

985
01:32:12,566 --> 01:32:14,625
Richard.

986
01:32:22,643 --> 01:32:27,546
- I'm going to die.
- Don't talk like that, Ellen. You're going to be all right.

987
01:32:27,648 --> 01:32:29,707
No.

988
01:32:32,019 --> 01:32:35,420
And you mustn't feel sorry for me.

989
01:32:37,424 --> 01:32:39,483
I'm not afraid.

990
01:32:41,128 --> 01:32:44,757
Only... Only promise me
one thing.

991
01:32:47,201 --> 01:32:50,762
I... I want to be cremated...

992
01:32:50,871 --> 01:32:52,930
like my father...

993
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:58,811
and my ashes scattered
in the same place.

994
01:33:00,814 --> 01:33:03,783
- Remember?
- I remember.

995
01:33:05,285 --> 01:33:07,947
<i>- Promise?
- Of course, Ellen.</i>

996
01:33:08,055 --> 01:33:10,455
<i>- I'll promise anything you like, only...
- Richard!</i>

997
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:19,624
I'll never let you go, Richard.

998
01:33:22,302 --> 01:33:24,566
Never.

999
01:33:24,671 --> 01:33:26,696
Never.

1000
01:33:28,175 --> 01:33:30,200
Never.

1001
01:33:44,758 --> 01:33:49,957
Murder. Cold, brutal,
premeditated murder.

1002
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,161
The state will prove that,
on the afternoon of September 5...

1003
01:33:57,271 --> 01:33:59,762
at a picnic attended
by Ellen Harland, her mother...

1004
01:33:59,873 --> 01:34:02,398
and her adopted sister...

1005
01:34:02,509 --> 01:34:06,468
that Ellen met death
as a result of poisoning.

1006
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,741
The state will prove
that the sugar...

1007
01:34:08,849 --> 01:34:11,443
with which Ellen that day
sweetened her coffee...

1008
01:34:11,551 --> 01:34:13,610
was mixed with poison...

1009
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:17,349
and that she met death
by reason of that poison.

1010
01:34:17,457 --> 01:34:20,620
The state will prove
that the defendant...

1011
01:34:20,727 --> 01:34:22,786
had both motive and opportunity...

1012
01:34:22,896 --> 01:34:25,421
to commit this dreadful crime.

1013
01:34:25,532 --> 01:34:29,161
And the state will prove
that the defendant, Ruth Berent...

1014
01:34:29,269 --> 01:34:31,829
<i>deliberately and maliciously plotted...</i>

1015
01:34:31,939 --> 01:34:34,169
<i>and carried through the murder.</i>

1016
01:34:37,978 --> 01:34:40,037
It'll be all right.

1017
01:34:43,784 --> 01:34:48,517
I refer now to the envelope found
in the defendant's leather jacket.

1018
01:34:48,622 --> 01:34:51,989
When you analyzed the contents
of this envelope, what did you find?

1019
01:34:54,928 --> 01:34:58,193
Shortly after you made this test,
I came to you with a sealed parcel.

1020
01:34:58,298 --> 01:35:00,960
<i>Yes, sir. The contents was a bottle
half full of white powder.</i>

1021
01:35:01,068 --> 01:35:03,127
I show you the bottle.

1022
01:35:04,304 --> 01:35:06,363
That's it.

1023
01:35:06,473 --> 01:35:08,532
- You analyzed the contents?
- I did.

1024
01:35:08,642 --> 01:35:11,008
- What was it?
- Pure arsenic.

1025
01:35:11,111 --> 01:35:14,808
- Your witness, Mr. Robie.
- Uh, no questions.

1026
01:35:14,915 --> 01:35:18,407
<i>Mr. Medcraft, you are the manager
of the Bay State Mortuary.</i>

1027
01:35:18,518 --> 01:35:21,919
- I am.
- Were the remains of the late Mrs. Ellen Harland...

1028
01:35:22,022 --> 01:35:25,048
- cremated at your establishment?
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:35:25,158 --> 01:35:28,525
- Who made the arrangements?
- Miss Ruth Berent.

1030
01:35:28,628 --> 01:35:33,224
<i>- Your witness.
- Uh, no questions, Mr. Quinton.</i>

1031
01:35:34,835 --> 01:35:37,201
Mr. Carlson,
what is your occupation?

1032
01:35:37,304 --> 01:35:39,499
Vice president of
the Seaboard Trust Company.

1033
01:35:39,606 --> 01:35:43,406
Your bank is trustee for the estate
of the late Ellen Berent Harland?

1034
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:46,911
- Yes, sir.
- When was the last time that you saw Mrs. Harland?

1035
01:35:47,014 --> 01:35:49,073
Just after she got out
of the hospital.

1036
01:35:49,182 --> 01:35:53,118
Did she make any provision in her will
about being cremated after her death?

1037
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:56,087
- No, she did not.
- Would you tell the jury...

1038
01:35:56,189 --> 01:35:58,885
what provision she did make.

1039
01:35:58,992 --> 01:36:03,292
She requested that she be buried in the
family vault at Mount Auburn Cemetery.

1040
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:25,612
- Hello, Dick.
- Hello.

1041
01:36:25,719 --> 01:36:27,778
- Good evening.
- Good evening, dear.

1042
01:36:32,192 --> 01:36:35,286
Tomorrow, Dick, you'll go
on the witness stand.

1043
01:36:35,395 --> 01:36:37,420
Just remember that Quinton
isn't just the prosecutor.

1044
01:36:37,531 --> 01:36:39,999
<i>You may rest assured he'll have
his brass knuckles on.</i>

1045
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,331
He'll throw
the whole book at you.

1046
01:36:43,437 --> 01:36:48,272
He'll ask you some questions that won't
be easy to answer, one in particular.

1047
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:50,502
<i>You swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth...</i>

1048
01:36:50,610 --> 01:36:52,669
<i>and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</i>

1049
01:36:52,779 --> 01:36:54,838
I do.

1050
01:37:00,454 --> 01:37:02,854
- Your name?
- Richard Harland.

1051
01:37:02,956 --> 01:37:05,322
- Your profession?
- Writer.

1052
01:37:05,425 --> 01:37:10,453
If you don't mind, Mr. Harland, I shall
ask you, for a moment, to be a reader.

1053
01:37:10,564 --> 01:37:14,967
I have been asked how I happened
to investigate the death of Mrs. Harland.

1054
01:37:15,068 --> 01:37:17,195
This letter is my answer.

1055
01:37:19,606 --> 01:37:22,769
I ask you to read it.

1056
01:37:25,645 --> 01:37:28,739
- Aloud?
- Please.

1057
01:37:30,784 --> 01:37:34,618
"Dear Russ, I am writing
this letter to you...

1058
01:37:34,721 --> 01:37:37,383
"because we once meant
a great deal to each other...

1059
01:37:37,491 --> 01:37:39,959
"and there's no one else
to whom I can go for help.

1060
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:51,497
"It was after I left the hospital I first
began to sense a change in my husband.

1061
01:37:51,605 --> 01:37:55,632
"At first, I thought it might be
due to the loss of our child...

1062
01:37:55,742 --> 01:37:58,074
"and then the truth, the awful truth,
began to dawn on me.

1063
01:37:58,178 --> 01:38:00,271
"The reason for the change was Ruth.

1064
01:38:07,487 --> 01:38:10,081
"I went to Ruth and begged her
to give him up.

1065
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:13,990
"She said she intended to have
him and would stop at nothing.

1066
01:38:14,094 --> 01:38:16,187
"I told Ruth I would never
give Richard a divorce...

1067
01:38:16,296 --> 01:38:19,265
"and it was then that she
threatened to kill me.

1068
01:38:22,969 --> 01:38:25,870
<i>Go on, Mr. Harland.</i>

1069
01:38:25,972 --> 01:38:29,408
"Russ, I know she means it
and is capable of it.

1070
01:38:29,509 --> 01:38:32,171
She will kill me
the first chance she gets."

1071
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:35,146
If you don't mind, Mr. Harland, will you
read that last paragraph a little louder.

1072
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:39,812
"She will kill me
the first chance she gets."

1073
01:38:42,622 --> 01:38:44,681
Go on, Mr. Harland.

1074
01:38:44,791 --> 01:38:47,021
"I'm afraid to stay in the house,
but I can't leave without Richard.

1075
01:38:47,127 --> 01:38:49,561
"I'd rather die than give him up.

1076
01:38:49,663 --> 01:38:52,097
"I don't know what to do
or where to turn except to you, Russ.

1077
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:56,226
- Please help me. Ellen."
- Do you identify the handwriting in this letter?

1078
01:38:56,336 --> 01:38:59,931
- Yes. Ellen's.
- I call your attention to the first sentence.

1079
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:03,976
I am writing this letter to you because
we once meant a great deal to each other.

1080
01:39:04,077 --> 01:39:07,103
Do you know
the significance of this?

1081
01:39:07,214 --> 01:39:10,149
I suppose it refers to the fact that
you once were engaged to her.

1082
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:14,084
Yes. We were once engaged. Did you
know that when you first met her?

1083
01:39:14,187 --> 01:39:16,246
- She was wearing an engagement ring.
- You knew when you met her...

1084
01:39:16,356 --> 01:39:18,415
- that she was engaged to another man.
- Yes.

1085
01:39:18,525 --> 01:39:20,584
- And in spite of that, you made love to her.
- I suppose so.

1086
01:39:20,694 --> 01:39:23,128
Would you tell the jury
about this courtship.

1087
01:39:23,230 --> 01:39:25,289
I didn't exactly court her.

1088
01:39:25,398 --> 01:39:27,457
- You mean that she courted you?
- No, not that either.

1089
01:39:27,567 --> 01:39:31,128
- Then what do you mean?
- I knew that she'd marry me if I asked her to.

1090
01:39:31,238 --> 01:39:34,071
- And so you decided to ask her.
- No. I decided not to.

1091
01:39:34,174 --> 01:39:36,972
- Did she ask you?
- Not exactly.

1092
01:39:37,077 --> 01:39:40,274
Well, then how did you
happen to get married?

1093
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:44,077
Well, I found one day that she had
removed her engagement ring.

1094
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:46,744
She gave me to understand...

1095
01:39:46,853 --> 01:39:49,583
I realized then that
I was in love with her.

1096
01:39:49,689 --> 01:39:51,748
- Did you tell her so?
- Yes.

1097
01:39:51,858 --> 01:39:55,294
- What did she say?
- She said she would never let me go.

1098
01:39:55,395 --> 01:39:58,159
How soon after this
were you married?

1099
01:39:58,265 --> 01:40:00,324
A couple of days later.
She wanted it that way.

1100
01:40:00,433 --> 01:40:03,925
- Were you reluctant?
- I was doubtful.

1101
01:40:04,037 --> 01:40:07,939
Now, Mr. Harland, I don't
say this critically nor in mockery...

1102
01:40:08,041 --> 01:40:10,532
nor to suggest
that you are conceited...

1103
01:40:10,644 --> 01:40:14,273
but simply to be sure that
I understand you correctly.

1104
01:40:14,381 --> 01:40:18,511
You suggest that a beautiful young woman
engaged to another man falls in love with you...

1105
01:40:18,618 --> 01:40:22,486
wins you and persuades you into a quick
marriage against your better judgment.

1106
01:40:22,589 --> 01:40:25,888
Is that a fair statement of the facts?

1107
01:40:25,992 --> 01:40:28,051
<i>- Yes.
- I see.</i>

1108
01:40:28,161 --> 01:40:31,187
Now, how soon after this did you
begin to regret your surrender?

1109
01:40:31,298 --> 01:40:34,859
- Were you happy with your wife for the first month?
- Completely.

1110
01:40:34,968 --> 01:40:37,027
- The second, the third, the fourth?
- Yes.

1111
01:40:37,137 --> 01:40:40,504
Was Ruth at the ranch in New Mexico
during the time Ellen met and courted you?

1112
01:40:40,607 --> 01:40:42,871
- Yes.
- Did you see much of Ruth at this time?

1113
01:40:42,976 --> 01:40:46,377
- No.
- Where did you go after you left New Mexico?

1114
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:49,073
To Warm Springs, Georgia,
to visit my brother, Danny.

1115
01:40:49,182 --> 01:40:52,583
- During your residence in Warm Springs, did you have any servants?
- No.

1116
01:40:52,686 --> 01:40:54,745
- Who did the housework?
- Ellen.

1117
01:40:54,854 --> 01:40:57,220
- And the cooking?
- Ellen.

1118
01:40:57,324 --> 01:41:01,488
<i>- You couldn't afford servants.
- It wasn't a question of afford. She preferred it that way.</i>

1119
01:41:01,594 --> 01:41:03,653
- Ellen liked doing things for you.
- Yes.

1120
01:41:03,763 --> 01:41:05,822
- Did Ruth come to visit you during this time?
- No.

1121
01:41:05,932 --> 01:41:09,333
Where did you go
after you left Warm Springs?

1122
01:41:09,436 --> 01:41:12,337
To a fishing lodge I have
at a place called Back of the Moon.

1123
01:41:12,439 --> 01:41:15,567
- Did anyone come with you?
- My brother, Danny.

1124
01:41:15,675 --> 01:41:17,939
- When was that?
- In June.

1125
01:41:18,044 --> 01:41:20,103
- In June, were you still happy with your wife?
- Yes.

1126
01:41:20,213 --> 01:41:22,272
- How aboutJuly?
- Yes.

1127
01:41:22,382 --> 01:41:24,577
You loved her in July.
How about August?

1128
01:41:24,684 --> 01:41:28,381
- Did anyone come to visit you in August?
- Mrs. Berent.

1129
01:41:28,488 --> 01:41:31,286
- Anybody else?
- Ruth.

1130
01:41:31,391 --> 01:41:33,689
You loved Ellen in August.

1131
01:41:33,793 --> 01:41:37,786
<i>- Well, how about August?
- My brother was drowned in August.</i>

1132
01:41:37,897 --> 01:41:40,457
Yes, I... I know how that
must have saddened you...

1133
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:42,626
but did it affect your love for Ellen?

1134
01:41:44,704 --> 01:41:46,899
- Danny meant a lot to me.
- So did Ellen.

1135
01:41:47,006 --> 01:41:49,736
- Yes.
- Danny was drowned in August.

1136
01:41:49,843 --> 01:41:54,405
Come to September. Did your love
for Ellen continue in September?

1137
01:41:54,514 --> 01:41:57,142
- In a different way.
- In what different way?

1138
01:41:57,250 --> 01:42:00,242
- We were to have a baby.
- You mean that your love for Ellen increased...

1139
01:42:00,353 --> 01:42:02,821
because she was going
to have a baby.

1140
01:42:02,922 --> 01:42:05,516
- No, not exactly.
- Did it grow less?

1141
01:42:07,827 --> 01:42:10,421
- I don't know.
- Then what do you mean by "in a different way"?

1142
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:12,589
- I don't know.
- During this time...

1143
01:42:12,699 --> 01:42:15,133
- you were living in Bar Harbor at the Berent home?
- Yes.

1144
01:42:15,235 --> 01:42:17,465
- And Ruth was there all the time.
- Yes.

1145
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:20,937
- Your wife was confined to her room.
- A good part of the time.

1146
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,099
- Did you see a great deal of Ruth during this time?
- Yes.

1147
01:42:23,209 --> 01:42:25,268
- Practically every day.
- Yes.

1148
01:42:25,378 --> 01:42:28,279
When did you stop loving Ellen?

1149
01:42:28,381 --> 01:42:31,179
I... I don't know.

1150
01:42:31,284 --> 01:42:35,084
Isn't it true that, shortly before
your wife died, you quarreled with her?

1151
01:42:36,289 --> 01:42:39,281
- Yes.
- What about?

1152
01:42:39,392 --> 01:42:42,850
- I can't say.
- Wasn't it because Ellen was jealous of Ruth?

1153
01:42:42,962 --> 01:42:45,328
<i>- She had no reason to be.
- Wasn't she?</i>

1154
01:42:45,432 --> 01:42:48,265
<i>- Ellen was jealous of everybody.
- But was shejealous of Ruth?</i>

1155
01:42:48,368 --> 01:42:51,098
- I refuse to answer that.
- Then perhaps you'll answer this.

1156
01:42:51,204 --> 01:42:53,798
<i>- Are you in love with Ruth?
- We're very good friends.</i>

1157
01:42:53,907 --> 01:42:56,671
<i>- Are you in love with her?
- I'm very fond ofher.</i>

1158
01:42:56,776 --> 01:42:59,142
I want you to answer yes or no.
I'm asking you a very simple question.

1159
01:42:59,245 --> 01:43:01,839
Perhaps you didn't understand me.
I shall repeat it for you.

1160
01:43:01,948 --> 01:43:05,440
Are you in love with Ruth?
Are you in love with Ruth?

1161
01:43:05,552 --> 01:43:07,713
Are you in love with Ruth?

1162
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:13,186
I hand you a copy
of Richard Harland's new book.

1163
01:43:13,293 --> 01:43:15,454
Kindly turn to the dedication page.

1164
01:43:17,664 --> 01:43:20,724
<i>- Would you please read the dedication.
- "To the Gal with the Hoe."</i>

1165
01:43:20,834 --> 01:43:22,995
<i>- To whom does that refer?
- To me.</i>

1166
01:43:23,102 --> 01:43:26,663
Isn't it rather strange that Mr. Harland
didn't dedicate his new book to his wife?

1167
01:43:26,773 --> 01:43:29,333
I don't think Ellen was
very much interested in the book.

1168
01:43:29,442 --> 01:43:31,501
- But you were.
- Yes, very much.

1169
01:43:31,611 --> 01:43:33,670
- You worked with him on it.
- On the final draft, yes.

1170
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,839
- That was written while Ellen was in the hospital, wasn't it?
- Yes.

1171
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:38,918
You were together a great deal during
the time Ellen was in the hospital.

1172
01:43:39,018 --> 01:43:41,578
- Well, we were... Yes.
- Working on the book.

1173
01:43:41,688 --> 01:43:46,489
- Tell the jury where most of the action in this book takes place.
- Taxco, Mexico.

1174
01:43:46,593 --> 01:43:48,925
- Had you ever been to Mexico before?
- No.

1175
01:43:49,028 --> 01:43:51,087
During all the time that you lived
with the Berent family...

1176
01:43:51,197 --> 01:43:54,064
- had you ever gone away on a trip before alone?
- No.

1177
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:57,102
- Why did you decide to go to Taxco?
- I wanted to get away.

1178
01:43:57,203 --> 01:43:59,398
- Did you expect to meet anybody there that you knew?
- No.

1179
01:43:59,506 --> 01:44:02,066
- Did you expect to be joined there by anybody you knew?
- No.

1180
01:44:02,175 --> 01:44:05,076
- Did Mr. Harland suggest
that you go to Taxco? - No-No.

1181
01:44:05,178 --> 01:44:07,442
Let's get back
to the dedication.

1182
01:44:07,547 --> 01:44:12,109
- Why did Mr. Harland refer to you as "the Gal with the Hoe"?
- I'm rather fond of gardening.

1183
01:44:12,218 --> 01:44:14,277
- You did all of the gardening.
- Yes.

1184
01:44:14,387 --> 01:44:17,117
- Did you ever use any chemical sprays or insecticides?
- Yes.

1185
01:44:17,223 --> 01:44:20,454
<i>- Any containing arsenic, for example?
- I don't know.</i>

1186
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:23,791
I show you a bottle here in evidence.
Do you recognize it?

1187
01:44:23,897 --> 01:44:26,263
Yes. It was mine.
It held bath salts.

1188
01:44:26,366 --> 01:44:28,561
<i>- Are you aware of what it contains now?
- Yes.</i>

1189
01:44:28,668 --> 01:44:30,932
By what chemical process
do you suppose...

1190
01:44:31,037 --> 01:44:33,403
<i>- that bath salts turned into poison?
- I don't know.</i>

1191
01:44:33,506 --> 01:44:36,236
<i>- I show you a leather jacket in evidence. Do you recognize it?
- Yes, it's mine.</i>

1192
01:44:36,342 --> 01:44:38,401
I show you an envelope
here in evidence.

1193
01:44:38,511 --> 01:44:40,911
- Do you recognize it?
- Yes. It's the envelope containing the sugar.

1194
01:44:44,684 --> 01:44:47,983
And which the sheriff testified was found
in the pocket of this leather jacket.

1195
01:44:48,087 --> 01:44:50,885
- Yes.
- Did you wear this jacket on the day of the picnic?

1196
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:53,424
For a while, yes.
Then I gave it to Ellen to wear.

1197
01:44:53,526 --> 01:44:56,154
<i>- Why did you do that?
- She complained of feeling chilly.</i>

1198
01:44:56,262 --> 01:44:58,423
<i>- And so you loaned her the jacket.
- Yes.</i>

1199
01:44:58,531 --> 01:45:01,967
Will you tell the jury who prepared
the food in the picnic hamper.

1200
01:45:02,068 --> 01:45:04,764
- Ellen and I.
- Who prepared the sugar?

1201
01:45:04,871 --> 01:45:08,398
- I don't know. It must have been Ellen.
- Why do you think it was Ellen?

1202
01:45:08,508 --> 01:45:10,601
She was the only one
who took sugar with her coffee.

1203
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:13,406
- Who served the coffee on the day of the picnic?
- I did.

1204
01:45:13,513 --> 01:45:15,481
- And you gave her the sugar?
- Yes.

1205
01:45:15,582 --> 01:45:17,345
- And that night, she was dead.
- Yes.

1206
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:20,146
- And the very next day, her body was cremated.
- Yes.

1207
01:45:20,253 --> 01:45:22,813
And the following day, Harland left with
the ashes for the ranch in New Mexico...

1208
01:45:22,922 --> 01:45:26,153
to dispose of them there so that
no autopsy could be possible.

1209
01:45:26,259 --> 01:45:30,161
No, no. That wasn't the reason.
Ellen always wanted to be cremated...

1210
01:45:30,263 --> 01:45:32,697
and to have her ashes scattered
with those of her father.

1211
01:45:32,799 --> 01:45:36,166
Then why did she take the trouble
to have a clause inserted in her will...

1212
01:45:36,269 --> 01:45:38,260
requesting that she
be buried in Mount Auburn?

1213
01:45:38,371 --> 01:45:41,772
<i>- I can't explain it.
- There are a great many things you can't explain.</i>

1214
01:45:41,874 --> 01:45:44,775
You can't explain how the poison
got in the bottle of bath salts.

1215
01:45:44,877 --> 01:45:47,038
You can't explain
how it got in the sugar.

1216
01:45:47,146 --> 01:45:50,809
You can't explain why Ellen's body was
cremated so as to make an autopsy impossible.

1217
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:53,511
You can't explain why you made plans
to leave this country...

1218
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:55,679
shortly before your sister
was poisoned.

1219
01:45:55,788 --> 01:45:57,847
Well, perhaps you can
explain this!

1220
01:45:57,957 --> 01:46:00,016
When did you first fall in love
with Richard Harland?

1221
01:46:00,126 --> 01:46:02,720
<i>- Did you ever tell him that you loved him?
- No.</i>

1222
01:46:02,829 --> 01:46:05,354
<i>When did you fall in love with him?
You've dodged long enough.</i>

1223
01:46:05,465 --> 01:46:08,127
You can answer a simple question,
and I demand that you do so!

1224
01:46:08,234 --> 01:46:10,498
Just when did you fall in love
with Richard Harland?

1225
01:46:10,603 --> 01:46:13,470
Did you love him after his brother,
Danny, was drowned?

1226
01:46:13,573 --> 01:46:17,873
Did you love him after the death of
his stillborn child, after his wife died?

1227
01:46:17,977 --> 01:46:21,140
Did you love him last week,
a month before, a year before?

1228
01:46:21,247 --> 01:46:23,408
<i>Are you in love with him today?</i>

1229
01:46:23,516 --> 01:46:27,077
Yes. Yes, I am in love with him.

1230
01:46:27,186 --> 01:46:30,155
<i>I think I've always loved him.</i>

1231
01:46:30,256 --> 01:46:34,283
The state recalls
Richard Harland to the stand.

1232
01:46:35,595 --> 01:46:37,620
That's all.

1233
01:46:45,605 --> 01:46:47,835
Get some water, please!

1234
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:50,176
<i>Order in the court!</i>

1235
01:46:50,343 --> 01:46:55,280
<i>Richard Harland, you heard that woman
finally tell the truth...</i>

1236
01:46:55,381 --> 01:46:58,111
<i>and now I want the truth out of you!</i>

1237
01:46:58,217 --> 01:47:01,380
You heard Ruth Berent
confess her love for you...

1238
01:47:01,487 --> 01:47:05,116
and now I ask you... as I have asked
you over and over, time and again...

1239
01:47:05,224 --> 01:47:07,283
are you in love with her?

1240
01:47:07,393 --> 01:47:10,226
<i>Are you in love with the woman
who murdered your wife?</i>

1241
01:47:10,329 --> 01:47:13,298
My wife was not murdered.
She killed herself.

1242
01:47:13,399 --> 01:47:16,960
- Do you honestly believe Ellen committed suicide?
- Yes.

1243
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:19,538
Knowing her as you did and I did,
you think her capable...

1244
01:47:19,639 --> 01:47:23,097
not only of committing suicide but falsely
accusing her own sister of her death?

1245
01:47:23,209 --> 01:47:25,268
Ellen was capable of anything.

1246
01:47:25,378 --> 01:47:29,075
You actually want the jury to believe
that she was that sort of monster?

1247
01:47:29,182 --> 01:47:31,582
<i>Yes, she was that sort of monster...</i>

1248
01:47:31,684 --> 01:47:34,312
a woman who sought to possess
everything she loved...

1249
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:36,718
who loved only for
what it could bring her...

1250
01:47:36,823 --> 01:47:39,291
whose love estranged
her own father and mother...

1251
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:42,452
whose love possessed her father
until he couldn't call his soul his own...

1252
01:47:44,097 --> 01:47:47,931
who, by her own confession
to me, killed my brother...

1253
01:47:48,034 --> 01:47:50,093
killed her own unborn child...

1254
01:47:52,371 --> 01:47:55,636
And who is now reaching from the grave
to destroy her innocent sister.

1255
01:47:57,043 --> 01:47:59,102
Yes, she was that sort of monster.

1256
01:48:02,915 --> 01:48:05,406
Order in the court!

1257
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:10,246
<i>I can't believe it. Suicide?</i>

1258
01:48:13,392 --> 01:48:18,523
It took the jury only ten minutes to
bring a verdict of not guilty for Ruth.

1259
01:48:18,631 --> 01:48:21,794
But Harland had sacrificed himself.

1260
01:48:21,901 --> 01:48:25,803
In withholding knowledge
of Ellen's crime, he'd become an accessory.

1261
01:48:25,905 --> 01:48:28,499
He got two years.

1262
01:48:28,608 --> 01:48:31,008
But Ellen had lost.

1263
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:33,738
I guess it's the only time
she didn't come out first.

1264
01:48:38,084 --> 01:48:40,882
I guess Dick's about home now.

1265
01:48:41,305 --> 01:49:41,436
