1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,091
This way to the sanitarium.

3
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:50,761
Free bus to the sanitarium.

4
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,852
This way to the Standish Sanitarium.
Standish San... Standish San...

5
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:57,516
This... This way to the Standish...

6
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:00,316
Stand... Free bus. Free bus.
Standish Sanitarium.

7
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,026
Free bus to the sanitarium.
Just got room for a few more.

8
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:10,948
- Sanitarium?
- No, racetrack.

9
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,868
You don't wanna go there.
You're sick.

10
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:14,788
I'm going to the races!

11
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:18,249
All right. You want something hot
in the fifth race?

12
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:22,879
Sanitarium? Bus to the sanitarium.
Standish Sanitarium.

13
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,051
Free bus to the sanitarium.

14
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:29,719
It's no use, Tony.

15
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:33,726
If business keeps up like this,
I'm afraid I'll have to drive the car myself.

16
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:36,471
Oh, no, Miss Judy. You can't fire me.

17
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,651
- But what if I can't pay your salary?
- That's different.

18
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,394
You don't have to pay me,
but you can't fire me.

19
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:45,444
- Tony, you're sweet.
- Yeah. And don't worry, Miss Judy...

20
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:49,117
...I'm gonna get us some customers
if I have to make them sick myself.

21
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,696
Tony, I'm afraid we need
more than customers.

22
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,828
You don't understand.
I owe a great deal of money.

23
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,493
Far more than I can ever pay.

24
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:01,206
Let me see.
Who do I know that's rich?

25
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:04,669
How about that big, strong,
sick woman at the sanitarium?

26
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:06,637
- You mean Mrs. Upjohn?
- That's the one.

27
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,134
She'd lend you the money.

28
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:11,723
Oh, she's rich. Why, last week,
she gave me a dollar tip.

29
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:13,721
She did once offer to help.

30
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:16,221
But it doesn't seem right
to borrow from a patient.

31
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:18,687
- Then we make her a partner.
- Oh, Tony.

32
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:21,315
We gotta hurry
before she changes her mind.

33
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:31,528
Go ahead, Miss Judy.
There's Mrs. Upjohn now.

34
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:34,623
- But, Mrs. Upjohn...
- There's no use, doctor. I'm leaving!

35
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,745
Mr. Whitmore, I want my bill at once.

36
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,411
- Just as you say.
- What's the matter, Mrs. Upjohn?

37
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:42,997
It's no fault of yours, my dear.
It's the doctor.

38
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:46,010
Telling me I'm perfectly well
when I know I'm on the verge...

39
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:49,049
...of a nervous collapse.
Goodbye, Judy, dear.

40
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:51,596
Have the boy come up
and get my bags, please.

41
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:07,046
Gil! Oh, Gil!

42
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:10,734
- I'm glad you're here.
- What is it, honey?

43
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:14,576
Hold me tight. I'll be all right.

44
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:16,907
Come on, honey, tell me.

45
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:19,290
It's Mrs. Upjohn.

46
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:21,004
She's leaving.

47
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:24,623
Oh, let her leave. Say, I have something
here worth 100 Upjohns.

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,505
You don't understand.
I'm going to lose this place.

49
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:32,257
No, you're not. That's what I'm trying
to tell you. From me to you, with love.

50
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:35,636
Your radio contract. You've got it!

51
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:41,104
"Gelding, out of Honey Lamb
by Blue Bolt...

52
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:44,893
...two-year, Hi Hat."

53
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:49,734
- Why, Gil, this doesn't make sense.
- It's a horse, honey, a racehorse.

54
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,696
Perhaps I'm awfully stupid,
but what do we want with a horse?

55
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,278
I'll tell you. Horse wins race,
owner wins money.

56
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:58,955
Owner gives money to girl he loves.
Girl saves sanitarium. It's very simple.

57
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:02,127
Very simple?
But what happens if horse loses race?

58
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:06,709
Oh, but he can't lose. He's a wonder.
I picked him up for a song, only $ 1500.

59
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:08,627
Fifteen hundred dollars?

60
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:12,130
That's all the money
you had in the world.

61
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:14,714
Well, I still have my job
singing at the casino.

62
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:18,225
Now, Gil. You return that horse at once
and get your money back.

63
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:20,305
You've got to go on
with your music.

64
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:23,482
You need money fast, more than
I could make 10 years of singing.

65
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:28,147
I don't care. I want you to be
a great singer, not a racetrack tout.

66
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:30,730
Oh, wait a minute.
That isn't fair!

67
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,862
- Are you going to return that horse?
- I can't. I just bought him.

68
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:37,535
You mean you don't want to. You'd rather
bet on a horse than on yourself.

69
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:41,158
- Of all the ungrateful people!
- What have I got to be grateful for?

70
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:44,870
You've thrown your career away on a long
shot and gambled away our happiness.

71
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:49,211
Here. Take your horse.
And I hope you're very happy with it.

72
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:55,181
I'm going to someone
who understands me, to Dr. Hackenbush.

73
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,267
Dr. Hackenbush? Why, I never heard
of him. Has he a sanitarium?

74
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:02,184
The biggest in Florida, that's what he said.
Of course, I was never there.

75
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:06,852
Hugo, I mean, Dr. Hackenbush, always
insisted on treating me in my home.

76
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:10,194
I didn't know there was a thing
the matter with me until I met him.

77
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,447
Excuse, please.

78
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,208
We're getting a lot of customers since
they heard Dr. "Hackenapuss" is coming.

79
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,122
- Did you say Hackenbush?
- Yes, ma'am.

80
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:30,133
I wonder if that could be
the same one.

81
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:31,878
Where does he come from?

82
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:35,053
- Where's your Hackenapuss come from?
- Palmville, Florida.

83
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:36,882
That's the one!

84
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:40,392
Why... Why, Judy!

85
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:43,396
Why didn't you tell me
Dr. Hackenbush was coming here?

86
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:45,355
Dr. Hackenbush?

87
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:47,731
Oh, I'm so excited!

88
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:49,978
Judy, why don't you make him
chief of staff.

89
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:52,443
He'd do wonders for the sanitarium.

90
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:57,075
With Dr. Hackenbush in charge,
I might help you financially.

91
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:59,570
I don't say I will, but I might.

92
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:04,243
Oh, Mr. Whitmore, have my bags
sent right up. I'm staying!

93
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,377
- Who's Dr. Hackenbush?
- I don't know.

94
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,418
But if she wants a Hackenapuss,
she's going to get a Hackenapuss.

95
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:28,674
Inhale.

96
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:30,509
Exhale.

97
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:32,678
Inhale.

98
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:34,513
Exhale.

99
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,016
Inhale.

100
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:39,018
Exhale.

101
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:41,187
Inhale.

102
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,156
- Here's a telegram for you, doc.
- What does it say?

103
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,871
Well, goes on to say...
How should I know?

104
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:49,120
"Come up and take care
of Mrs. Upjohn. Stop.

105
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:52,665
You can write your own ticket. Stop.
Come at once, Standish Sanitarium."

106
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:55,712
Mrs. Upjohn. Ah, Emily.

107
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:58,460
She never forgot that hayride.

108
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:00,134
Don't she know you're a vet?

109
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,679
She's so in love with me,
she doesn't know anything.

110
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:04,346
That's why she's in love with me.

111
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,307
They could throw a horse doctor in jail
for treating people.

112
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:10,482
They can throw a horse doctor in jail
for not paying his rent too.

113
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:13,059
- Up in there.
- What have I got to lo...?

114
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:40,971
Take one of those every half-mile.
And call me if there's any change.

115
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:48,220
Mr. Morgan, if I sign this, it means I turn
the sanitarium over to you today.

116
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,603
That's right,
and I'll give you $5000.

117
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:53,100
But the notes aren't due.
I've got almost a month.

118
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:56,942
This place has been losing money steadily.
You'll never be able to pay.

119
00:08:57,114 --> 00:09:00,032
If you wait, I'll take it over,
and you won't get a cent.

120
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:04,827
As your business manager, Judy, I strongly
advise you to take Mr. Morgan's offer.

121
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:07,488
You're forgetting that doctor
Mrs. Upjohn recommended.

122
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,371
Surely with him in charge,
we'll be able to pay Mr. Morgan.

123
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:13,331
Are you going to take the advice
of a hysterical patient?

124
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:15,747
- Now, look here, Miss Standish...
- Judy!

125
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:18,546
- Judy, he's here! He's here!
- Why, who's here?

126
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:21,550
Dr. Hackenbush!

127
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:23,762
Are you going to sign that or not?

128
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:26,056
- No.
- Of course she's not going to sign it.

129
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:29,263
I have a month. I can at least
try this new doctor.

130
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:31,727
You're going to wish
you'd taken that check.

131
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,393
Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan!

132
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:37,735
- You fixed that, all right.
- How'd I know she was going to butt in?

133
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:41,321
- I'll get to work on this new doctor.
- Work fast.

134
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:45,240
With Dr. Hackenbush in charge,
I'm sure my trustees will let me help you.

135
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:48,947
- I think I'm better able to advise...
- I don't want to hear any more about it.

136
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:52,493
I can't stand this excitement.
I know this will cause a relapse.

137
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,829
Oh, my metabolism! Doctor!

138
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:57,248
Oh, doctor!

139
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:01,133
Here, boy. Here, boy.

140
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:04,090
Take these bags to my room,
and here's a dime for yourself.

141
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:08,013
Oh, no, no, no, no. This is Mr. Whitmore,
our business manager.

142
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:11,186
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Here's a quarter.

143
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,312
You mustn't take the doctor
too seriously.

144
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,641
He probably feels tired
after his long trip.

145
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:18,819
Why shouldn't I be tired?
Did you ever ride four on a motorcycle?

146
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:20,779
And me, top man.

147
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:24,649
This is Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush,
your new chief of staff.

148
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:28,781
And now, doctor,
I'd like you to meet Miss Standish.

149
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:30,949
Oh, doctor.

150
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,525
Doctor.

151
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:34,833
Just a moment,
while I calm these paralytics.

152
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:37,376
Oh, dear. Doctor.

153
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:40,584
Doctor, this is Miss Standish,
owner of the sanitarium.

154
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:44,469
- How do you do, Miss Standish?
- How do you do?

155
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:47,805
You're the prettiest owner
of a sanitarium I've ever seen.

156
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:50,513
- Thank you.
- You have a charming place here.

157
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,102
I knew your mother very well.

158
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,144
I'll let you in on a little secret.

159
00:10:57,318 --> 00:10:59,987
Many, many years ago,
in the dear, dim past...

160
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:02,479
...I proposed to your mother.

161
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:06,655
- But that's my father.
- No wonder he turned me down.

162
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:10,245
Now, doctor, I'd like you
to meet your new associates.

163
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:12,656
Johnson, Bellevue Hospital, 1918.

164
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,493
Franco, Johns Hopkins, '22.

165
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:18,915
- Wilmerding, Mayo brothers, '24.
- Dodge brothers, late '29.

166
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,415
Doctor, I'm happy to welcome
you as chief of staff.

167
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:24,842
I hope you'll be able to pull
the sanitarium out of its difficulties.

168
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:27,847
The sanitarium's having
a little financial trouble.

169
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,886
I get it. I'm not gonna get paid.
So long! Take it away!

170
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,515
Oh, no, no, no.
Doctor, please don't go.

171
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,357
- I'll take care of your salary.
- Oh, yeah?

172
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:38,812
The last job I had,
I had to take it out in trade.

173
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:41,143
And this is no butcher shop.

174
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,277
Not yet anyhow.

175
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:47,027
Judy, it seems to me,
if I may say so...

176
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:49,028
...we are making rather
a hasty decision.

177
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:52,120
Surely you don't question
the doctor's ability.

178
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:54,531
No. Not exactly.

179
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,042
But running a sanitarium calls
for a man with peculiar talents.

180
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:01,912
I've got the most peculiar talents
of any doctor you ever met.

181
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:05,008
I'm satisfied with Mrs. Upjohn's
recommendations.

182
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:08,546
If you'll excuse me, I'll go
and bring in the rest of the staff.

183
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:12,388
Why don't you go out and bring in
something. Preferably your resignation.

184
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,267
Tell me, Dr. Hackenbush...

185
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:18,723
...just what was your medical
background?

186
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,808
- Medically?
- Yes.

187
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:25,647
Well, at the age of 15, I got a job
in a drugstore filling prescriptions.

188
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:28,230
Don't you have to be 21
to fill prescriptions?

189
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:31,860
Well, that's for grownups.
I just filled them for children.

190
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,199
No, no, doctor.

191
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:37,742
I mean, where did you get your training
as a physician?

192
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:41,501
Oh, well, to begin with,
I took four years at Vassar.

193
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:46,381
- Vassar? But that's a girls' college.
- I found that out the third year.

194
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:49,469
I'd have been there yet, but I went out
for the swimming team.

195
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:54,764
The doctor seems reluctant
to discuss his medical experiences.

196
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:57,972
Well, medically, my experiences
have been most unexciting.

197
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:00,934
- Except during the flu epidemic.
- And what happened?

198
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:02,733
I got the flu.

199
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:08,109
- Oh, doctor, I think it's time for my pill.
- Ix-nay on the ill-pay.

200
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:11,366
Now, you told me
to take them regularly.

201
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,954
Just a minute, Mrs. Upjohn.

202
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:23,959
- That looks like a horse pill to me.
- Oh, you've taken them before?

203
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:27,630
- You sure you haven't made a mistake?
- You have nothing to worry about.

204
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:31,384
The last patient I gave one of those to
won the Kentucky Derby.

205
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:33,049
May I examine this, please?

206
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:36,299
Do you actually give those
to your patients?

207
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:38,469
Isn't that awfully large for a pill?

208
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:41,979
It was too small for a basketball,
and I didn't know what to do with it.

209
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,067
Say, you're awfully large
for a pill yourself.

210
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:47,855
Dr. Wilmerding...

211
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:51,319
...just what is your opinion?

212
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:53,983
It must take a lot of water
to swallow that.

213
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,735
Nonsense. You can swallow that
with 5 gallons.

214
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,072
Isn't that a lot of water
for a patient to take?

215
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,289
Not if the patient
has a bridge in her mouth.

216
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,328
The water flows under, the patient walks
over and meets the pill on the other side.

217
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:10,749
So it's war!
I'm off to the battlefield!

218
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:12,470
No, that's from the racetrack.

219
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:16,636
- Racetrack? Well, what am I doing here?
- Oh, doctor, don't leave me!

220
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:27,022
Well, you won it, Stuffy.

221
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:34,655
Nice work, Stuffy.

222
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,662
I told you to lose that race.

223
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:58,888
Stuffy, where are you? Where's Stuffy?
Did you see my jockey?

224
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,933
Whoa. Please, Mr. Morgan,
don't stay here.

225
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,428
You ought to beat the head
off that ornery devil!

226
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:06,061
Well, he only acts this way
when he sees or hears you.

227
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:13,397
I should have plugged that nag
when I owned him.

228
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,574
Please, Mr. Morgan,
don't stay here.

229
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,992
Calm down. He's gone now.
That's a boy.

230
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:24,080
You better stay out of Morgan's way
for a while.

231
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:29,625
Get your ice cream.
Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

232
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:32,491
Stuffy!

233
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:35,592
Hey, get out of there.

234
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:37,802
Hey, that was some ride
you put up.

235
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:40,180
I had 5 bucks right
on the nose.

236
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:43,020
I won 60 cents. Yeah.

237
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:44,930
Who you riding tomorrow?

238
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:47,347
What's the matter? What happened?

239
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:51,736
You're fired?
Oh, Morgan fired you, huh?

240
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:55,107
- He wanted you to throw the race?
- He wanted Stuffy to be crooked, eh?

241
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:57,074
You know he's honest.

242
00:15:57,868 --> 00:16:00,276
He's honest, but you gotta
watch him a little.

243
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:03,159
Gil, why don't you give Stuffy a job.
Let him ride Hi Hat.

244
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:06,582
We can't afford a jockey. We haven't
enough money to eat on ourselves.

245
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:10,702
Eat, eat, eat. All the time eat.
We don't have to eat. I'll eat.

246
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:13,123
- Hey, you.
- Hello, sheriff.

247
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,708
- Have you got the money for the feed bill?
- You see...

248
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:17,843
You guys have been stalling me
for weeks.

249
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:21,133
Either I get some money right now,
or I'm taking Hi Hat.

250
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:24,973
Wait, wait.
I'll give you some money.

251
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:26,390
There you are.

252
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:30,182
Five dollars? That's not enough.
Come on. Well?

253
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:33,609
All right, all right.
I've got some more. Just...

254
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:34,977
There you are.

255
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:38,738
That makes 10. Chicken feed.
Come on, you've got some more.

256
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,151
Yeah, but it's hard to get at,
you know?

257
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:43,321
- Come on, come on.
- All right. Don't hurry.

258
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:47,246
I've got it someplace.
I know it's someplace.

259
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:49,078
Here. I knew it was someplace.

260
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:52,836
Well, that's 15.
Have you got any more?

261
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:56,669
- I'll let you know in a minute.
- Quit stalling. Come on, hurry.

262
00:16:56,844 --> 00:16:59,216
All right, I've got some more,
but I can't hurry.

263
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:03,433
Hey, what are you doing? Cut it...
Get up. What is this? Cut it...

264
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:06,174
What are you trying to do?
Get up.

265
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,682
Here! Come back here!

266
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:17,854
Well, that's fine. Now we owe
the sheriff $ 120 and a sock.

267
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:20,439
It's a good thing Judy doesn't have
to depend on me.

268
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:26,039
- I can't even hold on to the horse.
- No? Well, we hold on to the horse.

269
00:17:31,212 --> 00:17:33,881
Say, if we only had some dough.
I got a tip on Sun-Up.

270
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:37,298
Sun-Up? He's in the next race!
We don't got much time!

271
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:39,544
Hey, wait! What are we gonna use
for money?

272
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:44,473
Hey! What are you doing,
you crazy kook, you?

273
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:48,718
Hey, look, look!
Sun-Up, he's 10-to-1.

274
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:52,347
Oh, boy, are we gonna clean up,
10-to-1.

275
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:55,894
- We haven't any money to bet.
- Don't worry. I get us some money.

276
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,193
I find a sucker someplace.

277
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:01,733
Scram. I think I see a sucker coming now.
Get out of here.

278
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:04,826
Get your ice cream.

279
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:11,579
Two dollars on Sun-Up.

280
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:15,536
Hey. Hey, boss. Boss, come here.
You want something hot?

281
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:19,712
Not now. I just had lunch.
Anyhow, I don't like hot ice cream.

282
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:23,965
Hey, come here. I no sell ice cream.
That's fake to fool the police.

283
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:28,552
I sell tips on the horses. I got something
today can't lose. One dollar.

284
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:32,428
No. Some other time. I'm sorry.
I'm betting on Sun-Up. Some other time.

285
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:34,932
- Two dollars on Sun-Up.
- Hey, boss. Hey. Come here.

286
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:37,185
Sun-Up is the worst horse
on the track.

287
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:41,904
- I notice he wins all the time.
- Just because he comes in first.

288
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:45,028
I don't want him any better than first.
Two dollars on Sun-Up.

289
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:47,610
Hey, boss, come here.
Come here.

290
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:51,453
Suppose you bet on Sun-Up. What you
gonna get for your money? 2-to-1.

291
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,330
One dollar, and you'll remember me
all your life.

292
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:57,789
That's the most nauseating proposition
I ever had.

293
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:02,426
Come on. Come on.
You look like a sport. Come on, boss.

294
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:05,264
Don't be a crunger for one buck.

295
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:10,049
Thank you.

296
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:12,019
- What's this?
- That's the horse.

297
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:13,468
How'd he get in here?

298
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:18,475
Get your ice cream.
Tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

299
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,318
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L."

300
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:26,359
I had that same horse
when I had my eyes examined.

301
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:28,989
Hey, ice cream.

302
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,615
What about this optical illusion
you slipped me? I don't understand it.

303
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,709
That's not the real name of the horse.
That's the name in code.

304
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:37,420
Look in your codebook.

305
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:39,913
- What do you mean, "code"?
- Look in the codebook.

306
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,294
- That will tell you what horse you got.
- I haven't got any codebook.

307
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,711
- You don't got one?
- You know where I can get one?

308
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:50,265
Well, just by accident, I think
I've got one right here. Here you are.

309
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:52,059
- How much is it?
- That's free.

310
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:56,225
- Oh, thanks.
- Just a $ 1 printing charge.

311
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,360
Well, give me one without printing.
I'm sick of printing.

312
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:02,397
Come on. You want to win?

313
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:06,154
- Yeah, sure. Of course I want to win.
- Well, then you've got to have this.

314
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:08,614
But I don't want the savings
of a lifetime...

315
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:11,455
...wiped out in the twinkling
of an eye.

316
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,200
- Here.
- Thank you very much.

317
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:19,703
Ice cream...

318
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,878
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L, page 34."

319
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:29,387
Hey, ice cream, I can't make head
or tail out of this.

320
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:33,883
That's all right. Look in the master
codebook. That will tell you where to look.

321
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,219
Master code? I haven't got
any master codebook.

322
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:39,563
- You don't got a master codebook?
- Do you know where I can get one?

323
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:43,434
Well, just by accident, I think
I've got one right here. There you are.

324
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:47,313
A lot of quick accidents around here
for a quiet neighborhood.

325
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:50,741
- Is there a printing charge on this?
- No.

326
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,453
Oh, thanks.

327
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:55,408
Just a $2 delivery charge.

328
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,824
Delivery charge?
I'm standing right next to you.

329
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:02,253
Well, for such a short distance,
I make it $ 1.

330
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:05,794
Couldn't I move over here
and make it 50 cents?

331
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:09,419
Yes, but I'd move over here
and make it $ 1 just the same.

332
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:12,838
Say, maybe I'd better
open a charge account, eh?

333
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:14,262
You got some references?

334
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:16,226
The only one I know
around here is you.

335
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:19,230
That's no good.
You'll have to pay cash.

336
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:23,230
A little while ago, I could have put $2
on Sun-Up and avoided all this.

337
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:25,774
Yeah, throw your money away.
Thank you very much.

338
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:27,275
- I'm all set, huh?
- Yes, sir.

339
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:30,117
Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

340
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:34,282
- Master code, master code, plain code.
- Get your ice cream...

341
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:38,120
...tootsie-fruitsie.
Get your tootsie-fruitsie...

342
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:44,461
"Z-V-B-X-R-P-L. The letter Z stands for J
unless the horse is a filly."

343
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:47,965
- Get your tootsie-fruitsie...
- Hey, tootsie-fruitsie.

344
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:51,634
- Is the horse a filly?
- Don't know. Look in your breeder's guide.

345
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:54,593
Get your ice cream...

346
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,388
What do you mean?
I haven't got any breeder's guide.

347
00:21:57,561 --> 00:21:59,518
You haven't got a breeder's guide?

348
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:03,556
Not so loud. I don't want it to get around
that I haven't got a breeder's guide.

349
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,854
Even my best friends don't know
I haven't got a breeder's guide.

350
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:12,236
Well, boss, I feel pretty sorry for you,
walking around without a breeder's guide.

351
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:14,449
Why, you're just throwing
your money away...

352
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,028
...buying those other books
without a breeder's guide.

353
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:28,755
Where can I get one?
As though I didn't know.

354
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:31,713
One is no good.
You got to have the whole set.

355
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:34,343
Get your tootsie-fruitsie...

356
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:37,136
You know, all I wanted was a horse,
not a public library.

357
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:39,635
- What do you mean? How much is a set?
- One dollar.

358
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:42,303
- One dollar?
- Yeah. Four for $5.

359
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:45,518
Give me the four of them.
There's no use throwing away money.

360
00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:46,973
All right, here you are.

361
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:49,525
This is all I'm buying too.
I didn't want so many...

362
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:52,698
- I thought you could do this quickly.
- There you are.

363
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:57,450
Six dollars on Sun-Up.

364
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:02,789
- Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.
- Breeder's guide.

365
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,869
Get your ice cream.

366
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:09,043
- "Z-V-B-X-R-P-L is Burns."
- Yeah, that's right.

367
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:10,461
- Burns?
- Yeah.

368
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:13,719
Some days it gives you the name
of the jockey instead of the horse.

369
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:18,514
You find out who jockey Burns is riding,
and that's the horse you bet on. It's easy.

370
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:21,555
Get your ice cream, tootsie-fruitsie.

371
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,895
I'm getting the idea of it.
I didn't get it for a long time.

372
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:27,438
It's pretty tricky when you don't
know it, isn't it?

373
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,068
It's not that book.

374
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:31,727
- It's not that book.
- It's not that book?

375
00:23:31,906 --> 00:23:33,448
Oh, I see.

376
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:36,949
No. It's not that book.
Not that book.

377
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:44,664
- Nope. Nope. It's not that book.
- It's not?

378
00:23:45,252 --> 00:23:46,628
No, you haven't got that book.

379
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,419
You've got it, huh?

380
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:00,633
I'll get it in a minute, though, won't I?

381
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,641
Get your tootsie-fruitsie.

382
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:08,140
I'm getting a fine tootsie-fruitsying
right here.

383
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:11,651
Get your ice cream.

384
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:14,939
- How much is it?
- One dollar.

385
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:18,484
- And it's the last book I'm buying.
- Sure, you don't need no more. Here.

386
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:21,827
Now, here's a...
Here's a $ 10 bill.

387
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:24,619
- Shoot the change, will you?
- I got no change.

388
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:27,247
I'll have to give you nine more books.
You don't mind.

389
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,127
- You take nine more books.
- Nine more?

390
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:33,211
- You don't handle any bookcases, do you?
- Well, you come tomorrow again.

391
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:36,468
- I didn't know that you needed...
- You're gonna win today.

392
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:39,009
I thought you just walk up
and bet on a horse.

393
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:41,851
- Open!
- Am I shedding books down there?

394
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:44,093
Close! Close! That's it.

395
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,476
It's a good thing I brought
my legs with me, eh?

396
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:48,723
- Now, what horse have I got?
- It's right here.

397
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:51,473
- I just heard the fella blowing his horn.
- Here it is.

398
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:54,819
Jockey Burns, 152.
That's Rosie.

399
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:57,527
- Rosie, yeah?
- Look! Oh, boy! Look, 40-to-1!

400
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,692
- 40-to-1, huh?
- Oh, what a horse!

401
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:04,116
Am I gonna give that bookie a whipping!
I was going to bet on Sun-Up at 10-to-1.

402
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,662
- Look, it's 40-to-1.
- I'll show them a thing or two.

403
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,835
Hey, there, big boy.
Two dollars on Rosie, eh?

404
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:11,877
Sorry, that race is over.

405
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:14,336
- I say the race is over.
- Over? Who won?

406
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:17,675
- Sun-Up.
- Sun-Up! That's my horse! Sun-Up.

407
00:25:17,845 --> 00:25:20,846
Sun-Up. Hurry up. Sun-Up.

408
00:25:21,015 --> 00:25:27,053
Goodbye, boss. Goodbye. Sun-Up.
Ten, 20, 30... Sun-Up! Forty, 50...

409
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:34,231
Get your tootsie-fruitsie. Nice ice cream.
Nice tootsie-fruitsie ice cream.

410
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,940
- Oh, Miss Standish?
- Yes?

411
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:40,950
- These calls came while you were out.
- Oh, thank you.

412
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:48,574
Hello.

413
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:52,452
- Mr. Stewart?
- I'm still out.

414
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,465
I'm sorry. Miss Standish is still out.

415
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,629
Yes, Mr. Whitmore.

416
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,375
What about that call
to the Florida medical board?

417
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:03,804
What? Well, keep on trying.

418
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:05,552
Call me the moment you get it.

419
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:08,561
You can't even get any action
out of your telephone operator.

420
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:11,267
Don't worry. I'll get the dope
on that Florida quack.

421
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,316
Now, listen, I want to turn this place into
a gambling casino before the season ends.

422
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:19,274
With my racetrack, my nightclub
and this...

423
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:22,402
...I'll have every sucker in America here,
but every day counts.

424
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:25,743
- I'll let you know when I get the call.
- I'll be waiting.

425
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,037
Doctor, may I have one
of your photographs?

426
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,405
Why, I haven't one.

427
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,833
I could let you have my footprints,
but they're upstairs in my socks.

428
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:35,673
I want to announce your association
with the sanitarium.

429
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,832
We'll send your picture
to all the papers.

430
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:40,381
- Florida papers?
- Yes. It'd be wonderful publicity.

431
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:44,420
Publicity? We mustn't have any of that.
You know, the ethics of my profession.

432
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:46,887
But we have to get new patients.

433
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:50,510
Well, after all, the old patients
were good enough for your father.

434
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:52,976
Besides, who wants to see my picture?

435
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:57,609
I'm not a famous man. I'm just a simple
country doctor with horse sense.

436
00:26:57,778 --> 00:26:59,189
Oh, you're too modest.

437
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:01,605
- We'll forget about the pictures.
- That's better.

438
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:04,534
And, doctor, remember,
I'm counting on you.

439
00:27:04,702 --> 00:27:07,868
The success of the sanitarium
is in your hands.

440
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:14,205
Look, Miss Standish, suppose...
Suppose I were to tell you...

441
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:16,287
...that I'm not the doctor
you think I am.

442
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:18,586
Well, you're the only one
that can help me.

443
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:20,715
And do be nice to Mrs. Upjohn,
won't you?

444
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:26,259
Well, she's not exactly my type,
but for you, I'd make love to a crocodile.

445
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:27,632
Silly.

446
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,105
Have the florist send roses to Mrs. Upjohn.
Write "Emily, I love you" on the bill.

447
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:36,645
Just a moment, Dr. Hackenbush.

448
00:27:38,152 --> 00:27:39,729
Yes, Mr. Whitmore.

449
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:43,486
No, I haven't been able to get that call
through to the Florida medical board.

450
00:27:43,657 --> 00:27:46,575
Well, I'm doing the best I can.
It ought to be here any minute.

451
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:50,611
If that call's what I think, she can cancel
those roses and make it lilies for me.

452
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,035
Get me Mr. Whitmore.

453
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:01,128
- Hello?
- Here's your Florida call, Mr. Whitmore.

454
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,589
All right. Hello?

455
00:28:03,761 --> 00:28:06,216
Florida medical board.
Good morning.

456
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:09,176
I'd like to talk to the man
in charge of the records, please.

457
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,508
Record department?
Just a moment, sugar.

458
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:15,768
Record department.
Colonel Hawkins talking.

459
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:20,272
Colonel Hawkins, did you get a wire
from me regarding Dr. Hackenbush?

460
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:23,696
I'm sorry, sir, but there's a hurricane
blowing down here...

461
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:26,534
...and you'll have to talk
a little louder.

462
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,191
It certainly is the windiest day
we ever did have.

463
00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:32,617
<i>It certainly is windy!</i>

464
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:36,119
I want to know about Dr. Hackenbush!

465
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,712
- Yes?
- Whitmore, cut out that squawking.

466
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:44,041
The patients are all complaining.

467
00:28:44,218 --> 00:28:47,338
<i>And I hope, sir, that that's</i>
<i>the information that you require.</i>

468
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:51,096
I'm sorry, colonel. I didn't hear it.
I was called to the Dictograph.

469
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:55,644
- What was that you said, sir?
- I was called to the Dictograph!

470
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:03,066
Whitmore, one more yelp out of you,
and I'll have you bounced out of here.

471
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:06,072
<i>And I trust, sir, that that answers</i>
<i>your question.</i>

472
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,407
I'm terribly sorry, colonel.
I didn't hear you.

473
00:29:09,577 --> 00:29:11,984
I can't hear you. You'll have to talk
a bit louder.

474
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:16,492
I want to find out something
about Hackenbush!

475
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,495
- Well, what is it now?
- That's the last time...

476
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,748
...I'm gonna warn you
about that yowling.

477
00:29:24,175 --> 00:29:26,748
<i>And in conclusion,</i>
<i>let me say...</i>

478
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:30,012
I'm sorry, colonel. What was
that you said about Hackenbush?

479
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:34,510
Hacken... You mean, Dr. Hackenbush?
Oh, no. He's not here.

480
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:37,141
I know he's not there. He's here!

481
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:40,100
Then what are you
bothering me for, Yankee?

482
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:43,275
But I want to know something
about his Florida record.

483
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:45,271
Here's your Florida call, Mr. Whitmore.

484
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:47,189
Operator, will you get off the line?!

485
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:50,116
- Hello? Hello, colonel.
<i>- Yes?</i>

486
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:54,282
Are you sure you're speaking
of Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush?

487
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:56,780
- Who?
- Hugo Z. Hackenbush!

488
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:58,656
Who's calling him?

489
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:04,292
- The Standish Sanitarium.
- Yeah, that's where he works.

490
00:30:04,465 --> 00:30:07,170
Say, I understand he's doing
a mighty fine job up there.

491
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:08,343
I...

492
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,300
I want to get some information
regarding his qualifications for the job.

493
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:17,013
- What job?
- As head of the sanitarium!

494
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:19,060
- Who?
- Hackenbush!

495
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:27,651
- Whitmore, are you calling me?
- No, you sap!

496
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:32,736
- Hello.
- Yes, now, what was that name?

497
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:35,320
Hackenbush. Hackenbush!

498
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:41,036
Well, as soon as he comes in,
I'll have him get in touch with you.

499
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:50,832
Hey, you see that sourpuss?

500
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:53,134
That's Whitmore,
the man you gotta watch.

501
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:55,345
You see, he's no good.
He's in with Morgan...

502
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:59,644
...and I think they're trying to get
the sanitarium away from Miss Judy.

503
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:04,142
Hey, hey! No, no, no.

504
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:06,807
You no gonna fight him.
You gonna watch him.

505
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:09,062
You gotta watch him like a hawk.

506
00:31:09,238 --> 00:31:12,737
That's it. Not so fast.
No, not so fast.

507
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:15,197
First, I gotta get you
in here as a patient...

508
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:17,527
...or else Whitmore's going
to get wise to you.

509
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:20,540
Come on, I take you to the doctor.

510
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:24,788
Stuffy! Stuffy! Hey, come here.
Hey, he won't hurt you.

511
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:28,378
No, no, come here.
This fella's a nice doctor.

512
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:32,132
You're hungry, eh?
You want some ice cream?

513
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:35,054
You want a nice, big steak?
With spinach?

514
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,844
All right, all right.
No spinach. No spinach.

515
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:41,516
Apple pie? And beautiful nurses?

516
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:44,439
Oh, baby, come on.
You're gonna get a nurse.

517
00:31:44,607 --> 00:31:46,730
Oh, my, you're gonna get plenty.

518
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:49,060
- Have you seen Dr. Hackenbush?
- No, doctor.

519
00:31:49,236 --> 00:31:50,814
Go find him.
Mrs. Upjohn wants him.

520
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:55,235
- What's the matter with Mrs. Upjohn?
- Nothing, in its most violent form.

521
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:03,077
- Pick me up at 5.
- Yes, sir.

522
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,417
- May I have an okay on this, please?
- I'm too busy right now.

523
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:13,508
I'll put the O on now
and come back later for the K.

524
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:15,551
- Dr. Hackenbush.
- A little later.

525
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:17,595
- Get me the Turkish bath.
- Yes, sir.

526
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:20,090
Dr. Hackenbush, Mrs. Upjohn
is complaining again...

527
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,426
...and these x-rays show
nothing wrong with her.

528
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:26,019
Is that so? Who are you gonna believe,
me or those crooked x-rays?

529
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,645
Doctor, the Turkish bath.

530
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:33,278
Hello? Gus, will you look in the steam
room and see if my frankfurters are done?

531
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:37,616
That will be all.
I have some important research.

532
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:38,985
Now...

533
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:57,468
Excuse me.

534
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:00,421
Oh, so you're the doctor.

535
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,137
Yeah, remember me?
I used to be in the book business.

536
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,888
Hey, forget about that, doc.

537
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:07,933
- I got some good news for you.
- Yeah? What are the odds?

538
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:10,598
No, no, it's no horse.
I got a patient for you.

539
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:12,852
Oh, a patient? Oh, fine.
What size?

540
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:16,312
- You didn't get him here any too soon.
- Hey, Stuffy!

541
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,361
Sit down here till I snatch you
from the jaws of death.

542
00:33:19,535 --> 00:33:23,319
- Just sit quietly.
- Sit down.

543
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:36,629
Either he's dead,
or my watch has stopped.

544
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:39,171
He's a good doctor.

545
00:33:39,346 --> 00:33:41,505
Knows his business.

546
00:33:48,063 --> 00:33:49,106
Singing doctor.

547
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,894
Here you are. Oh, come on.
This isn't gonna hurt.

548
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:55,686
- Come on, everybody gets that.
- Open up those pearly gates.

549
00:33:55,863 --> 00:33:58,532
Flip this under your flapper. Attaboy.

550
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:02,198
- Didn't hurt, did it, huh?
- He's pretty sick, eh, doc?

551
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:14,712
Well, that temperature
certainly went down fast.

552
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:19,835
Hey, don't drink that poison!
That's $4 an ounce.

553
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:23,055
We better put him to bed.
He looks awfully sick today.

554
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:24,718
Better get him a nurse too.

555
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:27,597
If he thinks that, he'll go to bed.

556
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:33,352
- Come on.
- There, now. Take it easy, will you?

557
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:35,732
He's been a doctor for years,
this fella.

558
00:34:35,903 --> 00:34:39,319
I've been a doctor longer than you've been
a patient, I'll tell you that.

559
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,897
Come on. Why do you do like that?

560
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:44,827
What do you think,
he's gonna play with you?

561
00:34:48,582 --> 00:34:51,749
No, don't look at me.
Let me look at you, huh?

562
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,380
No.

563
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,591
Don't look at me.
What do you think I am, a peepshow?

564
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,882
Get away there, will you?

565
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,802
It's rather a strange-looking sight.

566
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:09,924
- Yeah, it's serious, huh, doc?
- I haven't seen anything like this in years.

567
00:35:10,104 --> 00:35:13,473
The last time I saw a head like that
was in a bottle of formaldehyde.

568
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:17,018
- I told you he was sick.
- That's all pure desiccation along there.

569
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:21,905
He's got about a 15-percent metabolism
with an overactive thyroid...

570
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:24,861
...and a glandular affectation
of about 3 percent.

571
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:28,701
- That's bad, huh?
- With a 1 -percent mentality.

572
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,452
He's what we designate
as the crummy, moronic type.

573
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:39,417
This is the most gruesome-looking
piece of blubber I've ever peered at.

574
00:35:39,592 --> 00:35:41,750
Hey, doc! Hey, doc.

575
00:35:41,927 --> 00:35:45,795
You got the looking glass turned around.
You're looking at yourself.

576
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:48,591
I knew it all the time.

577
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:51,472
That was a good joke on all of us,
wasn't it?

578
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:56,066
Let's do it again sometime, huh?

579
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:00,527
Say, "Ah."

580
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:02,096
Louder.

581
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:04,891
Louder!

582
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,493
- Hey, doc, where you going?
- I'm going to the ear doctor. I'm deaf.

583
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:12,368
Come on back. It's not you. It's him.

584
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,661
Sometimes, I'm not sure
who's getting the examination here.

585
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:19,252
Take it easy, now, huh?

586
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:31,679
Say, am I stewed,
or did a grapefruit just fly past?

587
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:33,845
I don't see nothing.

588
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,571
If that's his Adam's apple,
he's got yellow fever.

589
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:50,199
- He's got ingrown balloons.
- He has, huh?

590
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:52,743
Well, we'll soon find out.

591
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:01,457
- Hold that till I get a rock.
- He's got a blister on his tongue.

592
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:03,625
- Is that what it is?
- I think he's a Ubangi.

593
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,968
Well, I'll get the hammer
and "Ubangi" that right off.

594
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:11,182
I had a case like that once in Düsseldorf
many years ago, and...

595
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,102
Say, it's grown considerably,
hasn't it, huh?

596
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,102
- What's that hairy fungus all over it?
- Some fungus, eh, doc?

597
00:37:18,274 --> 00:37:20,599
Not a great deal, no.

598
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:23,730
- Well...
- You're making a mistake. That's his head.

599
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:26,775
If that's his head,
he's making a mistake, not me.

600
00:37:29,451 --> 00:37:32,322
I can't do anything for him.
That's a case for Frank Buck.

601
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:35,787
Put him in the room
till Frank Buck gets here.

602
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:39,292
Fine. Shall we say a 50-buck room,
or would you prefer something better?

603
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:41,538
- We'll take something better.
- That's nice.

604
00:37:41,714 --> 00:37:46,257
- But we'll talk about the money tomorrow.
- Oh, no. Money on the line, or out you go.

605
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:52,264
"To Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush,
for saving my horse."

606
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:55,553
- Come here with that watch.
- You, a horse doctor?

607
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:58,100
- A little easy with that talk.
- A horse doctor.

608
00:37:58,272 --> 00:38:01,439
- Don't mention that word around here.
- Hey, that's terrible.

609
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:03,815
I'm gonna tell Miss Judy quick.

610
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:05,895
No. That's no good.

611
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:09,654
Miss Judy, she's depending on you.
A horse doctor.

612
00:38:09,825 --> 00:38:13,775
Now, listen, boys, I admit it.
You've caught me with my coat down.

613
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:17,786
- Well, it's been nice knowing you.
- Oh, no, you don't. Oh, no.

614
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,532
Let's get together.
I'm open to any kind of proposition.

615
00:38:20,711 --> 00:38:22,869
All right, you stick on this job.

616
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:26,961
You make Mrs. Upjohn happy,
or we're gonna have you thrown in jail.

617
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:29,423
Well, that doesn't leave me
much choice, does it?

618
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:32,218
Nobody must know
you're a horse doctor.

619
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:37,303
You make one false move,
and we fix you good.

620
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,315
I hate to admit it,
but I haven't got a leg to stand on.

621
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:43,894
Now, let's...
Hey, wait a minute!

622
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:45,977
- Bring that over here.
- There it goes.

623
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:49,356
- No, whip it around the other way.
- You keep quiet.

624
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:51,655
- We know what we're doing.
- Okay.

625
00:38:51,826 --> 00:38:54,317
Say, I thought I wasn't
gonna be able to walk again.

626
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:55,989
- I got it too.
- It's fine now.

627
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:59,081
Stuffy, I got it. Come on.

628
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:11,712
1:44. That's bad.

629
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:14,509
You think that's bad?
I know something worse than that.

630
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:16,509
- Did Stuffy tell you?
- Tell me what?

631
00:39:16,684 --> 00:39:18,807
- Hackenapuss, he's a horse doctor.
- What?

632
00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:23,355
- Sure. Here, ask Stuffy.
- A horse doctor?

633
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:28,190
- Does anyone else know about this?
- Only Hackenapuss, and he won't talk.

634
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:30,153
It's bound to get out sooner or later.

635
00:39:30,322 --> 00:39:33,157
There must be something
we can do to help Judy.

636
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:38,533
Yes. Hi Hat, you gotta win the race
and make us plenty of money.

637
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:42,332
Stuffy's right.
Hi Hat's too hungry to run.

638
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:45,917
I'm gonna get paid extra for singing
at the water carnival tonight.

639
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:49,006
That's fine. You sing,
I sell some more books...

640
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:51,251
...and Stuffy, he's gonna
put Hi Hat to bed.

641
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:53,384
I've gotta go to rehearsal.
See you later.

642
00:39:53,554 --> 00:39:55,428
- All right. Good luck.
- Hey, you!

643
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:56,843
Hello, sheriff.

644
00:39:57,016 --> 00:40:00,681
I told you not to take this horse out
till I got the rest of my dough.

645
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:03,178
We didn't take him out.
He walked out, we followed.

646
00:40:03,355 --> 00:40:05,313
I warned you.
Now I'm taking the nag.

647
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:10,607
Hey, you can't take that horse. How will
we win money to pay the feed bill?

648
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:15,240
That don't mean a thing to me. I'm gonna
put him where nobody will take him out.

649
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:41,516
He couldn't get you,
so he took six other girls.

650
00:47:44,551 --> 00:47:46,757
Isn't it beautiful?

651
00:47:46,928 --> 00:47:49,598
It's the prettiest number
I've ever seen.

652
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:56,099
Oh, Hugo, it's so impress...

653
00:47:57,189 --> 00:47:58,731
Now what?

654
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:00,699
The idea!

655
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:04,771
Oh, now, Judy, wait a minute.

656
00:48:04,946 --> 00:48:07,437
I want to talk to you.
You can't depend on Hackenbush.

657
00:48:07,616 --> 00:48:11,660
Mrs. Upjohn is perfectly satisfied with
Dr. Hackenbush, and that's what matters.

658
00:48:11,828 --> 00:48:14,366
In fact, she may take over
the notes tomorrow.

659
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:18,197
I guess everything's all right.
Nothing to worry about?

660
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:21,046
No, not a thing,
except that horse of yours.

661
00:48:21,213 --> 00:48:23,454
Wait. That horse is all right.
He's in the pink.

662
00:48:23,632 --> 00:48:26,633
Why, today he ran the mile in 1:36.
That horse is going places.

663
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:29,719
Oh, that's wonderful.
I wish you luck.

664
00:48:29,888 --> 00:48:32,759
- Thanks. I'm sorry I bothered you.
- It's all right.

665
00:48:34,017 --> 00:48:37,552
Now, Judy, I'm the biggest liar
in seven states.

666
00:48:37,729 --> 00:48:39,805
He isn't all right,
he isn't in the pink...

667
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:42,270
...and it was 1:44 instead of 1:36...

668
00:48:42,442 --> 00:48:45,360
...and the only place he'll go
is where the sheriff takes him.

669
00:48:45,529 --> 00:48:48,483
You can't possibly mean Hi Hat.

670
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:51,191
Well, there's only one horse
in my stable.

671
00:48:51,368 --> 00:48:53,195
Come on, let me have the rest of it.

672
00:48:53,954 --> 00:48:55,993
The only thing I'm going
to say is this, Gil:

673
00:48:56,164 --> 00:48:59,865
Don't ever let a horse
come between us again.

674
00:49:01,628 --> 00:49:03,003
She loves him.

675
00:49:03,171 --> 00:49:05,496
Everything is going to be
all right now.

676
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:20,552
Change your partners.

677
00:49:43,795 --> 00:49:47,959
- Hugo, I am surprised at you.
- Oh, you didn't know I could rumba?

678
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,720
Change your partners.

679
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:23,039
How would you like me
to dance away from you?

680
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,211
I'd be satisfied if you'd dance
off my feet.

681
00:51:04,918 --> 00:51:08,085
I'm disappointed. To think of your dancing
with that strange woman.

682
00:51:08,255 --> 00:51:11,505
Well, don't think of it.
Think of me dancing with you.

683
00:51:16,888 --> 00:51:18,430
I'm crazy about you.

684
00:51:19,266 --> 00:51:22,136
Nothing will ever
come between us again.

685
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:25,554
You don't know
how lonely I get at night...

686
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,221
...in my little room at the sanitarium.

687
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,859
Room 412.

688
00:51:30,026 --> 00:51:33,277
Perhaps I could come in
and say good night to you.

689
00:51:33,447 --> 00:51:37,278
Yes. We could have a midnight snack,
nice little steak between us.

690
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:39,701
Why, Hugo!

691
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:43,115
You'd stay up until midnight.
That's how you follow doctor's orders.

692
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,872
You know you're supposed to be in bed
by 10:00. 12:00. 10:00.

693
00:52:01,224 --> 00:52:03,596
Listen, we mustn't have
any disturbance here tonight.

694
00:52:05,228 --> 00:52:07,600
All right. I can wait.

695
00:58:49,674 --> 00:58:52,711
Well, it's in the bag. I have a date
with him in his room at 12.

696
00:58:52,886 --> 00:58:56,172
Nice going. See that you stay there
till I break in with Mrs. Upjohn.

697
00:58:56,348 --> 00:58:58,803
I want Hackenbush fired
out of the sanitarium tonight.

698
00:58:58,975 --> 00:59:01,098
Don't worry.
When you knock on the door...

699
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:05,184
...I'll have that moth-eaten Romeo
playing the balcony scene.

700
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:22,368
I got you. I got you. L...

701
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,948
You're spoiling my game.
What's the matter?

702
00:59:25,127 --> 00:59:26,834
What's the matter?

703
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:28,913
Buffalo Bill?

704
00:59:29,881 --> 00:59:32,551
Buffalo Bill goes ice-skating?

705
00:59:38,223 --> 00:59:39,468
Oh, Hackenbush!

706
00:59:39,808 --> 00:59:42,299
Oh, what's the matter with him?

707
00:59:42,477 --> 00:59:44,470
Dr. Hackenbush.

708
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:46,722
He's got a snake?

709
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:48,941
No.

710
00:59:49,443 --> 00:59:51,601
He's got apple dumpling?

711
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,731
Dr. Hackenbush...

712
00:59:53,905 --> 00:59:56,064
...he's got apple dumpling.

713
00:59:56,575 --> 00:59:57,950
No apple dumpling.

714
00:59:58,118 --> 01:00:00,324
No, it's no apple dumpling. No.

715
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:01,495
No.

716
01:00:01,913 --> 01:00:04,867
Oh, it's a woman! A woman.
Oh, I get it.

717
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:08,292
Oh, there's a woman.
Yeah. Smart, eh?

718
01:00:09,129 --> 01:00:11,086
Dr. Hackenbush...

719
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:13,213
...there's a woman...

720
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:15,758
...she got a wooden leg?

721
01:00:15,927 --> 01:00:16,927
No?

722
01:00:17,304 --> 01:00:19,213
She got a woodpecker?

723
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:21,180
She got a headache?

724
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:24,345
Dr. Hackenbush...

725
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:26,013
...there's a woman...

726
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:28,180
...she knock on the door!

727
01:00:28,356 --> 01:00:30,349
She knock on the door!
All right. All right.

728
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:34,855
Dr. Hackenbush, there's a woman,
she knock on the door...

729
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:43,490
You're crazy!
You make me sick.

730
01:00:43,663 --> 01:00:45,407
What's the matter now?

731
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:49,292
Oh, she's going to frame him!

732
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:52,794
Oh, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up.

733
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,993
- Who is it?
- It's Miss Marlowe.

734
01:01:25,163 --> 01:01:27,322
Just a moment, fruitcake.

735
01:01:47,018 --> 01:01:48,018
Yes?

736
01:01:49,062 --> 01:01:50,889
Oh, doctor.

737
01:01:51,064 --> 01:01:53,389
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

738
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:55,976
- Do you like gardenias?
- I adore them.

739
01:01:56,153 --> 01:01:58,822
- How did you know?
- I didn't, so I got you forget-me-nots.

740
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:02,784
One whiff of this,
and you'll forget everything.

741
01:02:04,077 --> 01:02:05,619
Won't you sit down?

742
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:12,709
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

743
01:02:12,878 --> 01:02:14,420
Oh, do you mind?

744
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:17,339
Not at all. I always take the wrap.

745
01:02:18,216 --> 01:02:20,505
You are such a charming host.

746
01:02:20,677 --> 01:02:22,504
The Hackenbushes, we're all like that.

747
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,837
- How about a short beer?
- Nothing, thank you.

748
01:02:25,015 --> 01:02:26,639
Thank you.

749
01:02:28,727 --> 01:02:32,807
Miss Marlowe, I've dreamed
of this moment ever since I met you.

750
01:02:32,981 --> 01:02:35,223
For days, I've been trying to see you...

751
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,938
...and I still don't seem
to be able to make the grade.

752
01:02:38,111 --> 01:02:41,895
A quiet evening alone with you.
What more could anyone ask?

753
01:02:42,407 --> 01:02:44,447
Say, did you sneak out of here?

754
01:02:44,618 --> 01:02:46,741
Oh, there you are.

755
01:02:47,871 --> 01:02:50,540
Isn't this too, too devastating?

756
01:02:51,082 --> 01:02:53,490
You mind carving?
I can't reach the steak from here.

757
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:54,668
Me?

758
01:02:55,462 --> 01:02:56,462
Yes?

759
01:02:57,464 --> 01:03:00,133
Hey, doc. Hey, doc, can you see us?

760
01:03:00,425 --> 01:03:02,916
If I can't, there's something wrong
with my glasses.

761
01:03:04,054 --> 01:03:05,881
You mean, her? She's the one?

762
01:03:06,056 --> 01:03:07,254
We fix her.

763
01:03:09,768 --> 01:03:12,259
Oh, baby, you look good to me!

764
01:03:12,437 --> 01:03:13,635
Oh, stop it!

765
01:03:13,814 --> 01:03:16,684
Wait a minute.
I thought you came here to see me.

766
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:19,147
Well, I can see you from here.

767
01:03:19,778 --> 01:03:21,023
Get up, you...

768
01:03:21,196 --> 01:03:22,607
You know my friend.

769
01:03:28,662 --> 01:03:30,820
Oh, no. Not for me,
three men on a horse.

770
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:34,042
What is the meaning of this?

771
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:35,787
Why, you little pest.

772
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:38,915
What's the matter with you mugs?
Haven't you got any gallantry?

773
01:03:39,089 --> 01:03:41,295
She's with Whitmore.
She's trying to frame you.

774
01:03:41,466 --> 01:03:44,301
Wouldn't mind framing her.
A prettier picture I've never seen.

775
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:45,667
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

776
01:03:45,846 --> 01:03:49,049
Hey, doc. Doc, I'm telling you a secret!
She's out to get you!

777
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:51,632
Why, I've never been so insulted
in my life.

778
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,016
Well, it's early yet.

779
01:03:54,187 --> 01:03:56,974
I'm leaving. I'm not going to stay here
with these men.

780
01:03:57,149 --> 01:04:00,185
You're not leaving. They're leaving.
I want you fellas to get out.

781
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,816
- Oh, my cape!
- Come back here with my woman.

782
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,021
You fellas are busting up
a beautiful romance.

783
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:08,073
Get her out.
She's going to make trouble.

784
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:11,826
You're wrong. This is my aunt. She's
come to talk over some family matters.

785
01:04:11,997 --> 01:04:13,705
I wish I had an aunt look like that.

786
01:04:13,874 --> 01:04:15,665
Well, take it up with your uncle.

787
01:04:15,834 --> 01:04:18,372
Hey, doc. Doc, you're playing with fire.

788
01:04:18,545 --> 01:04:21,332
- You didn't mind getting scorched.
- I got fire insurance.

789
01:04:21,506 --> 01:04:23,000
Well, you better get accident.

790
01:04:23,175 --> 01:04:25,381
Scram. Blow.

791
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:35,017
How do you like those cheap chiselers
horning in on us?

792
01:04:38,315 --> 01:04:40,023
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

793
01:04:46,364 --> 01:04:48,938
- How about a little Scotch?
- Why, I'd love it.

794
01:04:49,117 --> 01:04:51,026
Oh, I'll ring for some.

795
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:54,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

796
01:04:55,832 --> 01:04:58,869
Will you have the bellhop
hop up with some hop Scotch?

797
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:01,788
I'll flip you to see who pays for it.

798
01:05:01,963 --> 01:05:04,163
Oh, doctor.

799
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:13,968
I'm O'Reilly, the house detective.

800
01:05:14,142 --> 01:05:16,894
Don't talk so loud.
Your mustache will drop off.

801
01:05:17,437 --> 01:05:18,848
Have you got a woman in here?

802
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:21,560
If I haven't, I've wasted 30 minutes
of valuable time.

803
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:24,734
You better get her out.
This is the last time I'll tell you.

804
01:05:24,903 --> 01:05:26,563
The last time? Can I depend on that?

805
01:05:26,738 --> 01:05:30,189
Yes, because this time,
I'm going to stay all night.

806
01:05:35,914 --> 01:05:38,452
- This looks like a tough case.
- So does this.

807
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:41,413
I think I'll call me assistant.

808
01:05:55,142 --> 01:05:58,226
If you're looking for my fingerprints,
you're a little early.

809
01:06:09,364 --> 01:06:11,736
When you're through
with that steak, chew him.

810
01:06:16,663 --> 01:06:19,119
Pull in your ears.
You're coming to a tunnel.

811
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:23,996
Get along, little doggies.
Get along, little doggies.

812
01:06:25,005 --> 01:06:26,463
It's been a nice, quiet dinner.

813
01:06:26,631 --> 01:06:29,668
How do you know?
You haven't had any yet. Shall we?

814
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,761
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

815
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:40,137
Tomato soup?

816
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:46,977
Have you got a can opener?

817
01:06:47,152 --> 01:06:48,979
Oh, here it is.

818
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:52,030
Oh, I'm really not hungry.

819
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:53,823
Couldn't we just sit over here?

820
01:06:53,992 --> 01:06:57,408
I want to be near you.
I want you to hold me.

821
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,655
Oh, hold me closer.

822
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:02,831
Closer. Closer.

823
01:07:03,043 --> 01:07:05,794
If I hold you any closer,
I'll be in back of you.

824
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:09,168
You're so comforting.

825
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:11,084
The Hackenbushes, we're all like that.

826
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:13,667
Shall we sit down and bat it around?

827
01:07:22,145 --> 01:07:25,182
You're a little near-seated...
A little nearsighted, aren't you?

828
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:31,028
Oh, no. There's nobody else going
to get in. I bolted the door.

829
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,490
Say, fun is fun.

830
01:07:41,206 --> 01:07:43,282
We come to hang the paper.

831
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,032
How about hanging yourself instead?

832
01:07:48,588 --> 01:07:51,874
- Well, I'm going to stay right here.
- Thank you.

833
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:56,759
That's right. You work that side, I work
this side, and we meet on the ceiling.

834
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:59,765
You'll wind up on the gallows
is my prediction.

835
01:08:02,394 --> 01:08:04,932
I must be a citizen.
I just got my second papers.

836
01:08:09,776 --> 01:08:12,896
Looks like a wet track tomorrow, Stuffy.

837
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:19,444
- I think Stuffy's is the one with water.
- I'll see that he's dismissed immediately.

838
01:08:22,622 --> 01:08:24,745
What's going on?

839
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:28,455
Good gracious!

840
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:33,291
You're mistaken. There's no woman here.

841
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:35,625
- What are they...?
- No?

842
01:08:39,598 --> 01:08:40,598
Hugo!

843
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:42,725
What are you doing?

844
01:08:42,893 --> 01:08:46,012
I'm having the place done over.
It'll make a lovely honeymoon suite.

845
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:50,726
- Good...
- You better go, dear.

846
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:53,273
- We're tearing up the floor next.
- Oh, my.

847
01:08:53,445 --> 01:08:56,481
Come, Mr. Whitmore.
I've a few words to say to you.

848
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:03,954
Boys, you were wonderful.
You saved my life.

849
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:10,085
I'll get even. You... You dirty, low-down,
cheap, double-crossing snake.

850
01:09:10,253 --> 01:09:11,961
Thank you.

851
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:23,137
Hugo, speak to me.

852
01:09:24,142 --> 01:09:26,633
I said I was sorry about last night.

853
01:09:26,812 --> 01:09:30,015
I never should have mistrusted you.

854
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:34,225
Isn't there anything I can do
to make you forgive me?

855
01:09:34,402 --> 01:09:37,273
You could take over the notes
from Miss Standish.

856
01:09:37,781 --> 01:09:39,489
Then would you forgive me?

857
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:41,567
Well, it would help.

858
01:09:42,911 --> 01:09:45,663
Emily, I can't hide it any longer.
I love you.

859
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:47,574
Oh, Hugo.

860
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:50,501
It's the old, old story, boy meets girl.

861
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:52,412
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

862
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:54,379
Minneapolis and St. Paul.

863
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:56,464
Mrs. Upjohn.

864
01:09:56,967 --> 01:09:58,924
Judy has the papers ready
for you to sign.

865
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:01,051
Later, later. Can't you see we're busy?

866
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:03,344
It's all right.
I'll remember where I left off.

867
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:06,350
Must they do that now?

868
01:10:07,227 --> 01:10:08,935
Mrs. Upjohn, just a moment, please.

869
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:12,389
Mrs. Upjohn, may I present
Dr. Leopold X. Steinberg of Vienna?

870
01:10:12,566 --> 01:10:15,732
And this is Dr. Hackenbush.

871
01:10:15,902 --> 01:10:19,485
Doctor. I have a few questions
I would like to ask you.

872
01:10:19,656 --> 01:10:21,565
I've got a question I'd like to ask you.

873
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:25,157
Steinberg, what do you do
with your old razorblades?

874
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:28,621
I've been telling Dr. Steinberg
about your unusual case.

875
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:33,701
Yes, and I would like to know what
is this ailment, double blood pressure?

876
01:10:35,213 --> 01:10:38,084
Dr. Hackenbush tells me
I'm the only case in history.

877
01:10:38,258 --> 01:10:44,012
I have high blood pressure on my right side
and low blood pressure on my left side.

878
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:46,054
There is no such thing.

879
01:10:46,224 --> 01:10:48,217
She looks as healthy
as any woman I've met.

880
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,802
You don't look like
you ever met a healthy woman.

881
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:53,055
- What?
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

882
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:56,896
There's a very simple way to settle this.
Why not examine Mrs. Upjohn?

883
01:10:57,068 --> 01:10:59,394
- Splendid, splendid.
- Right this way, Mrs. Upjohn.

884
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:03,485
Dr. Hackenbush will show you,
then I insist that you apologize to him.

885
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:07,193
Come, Hugo. The idea!

886
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:13,448
Hey, doc, where you going?
If Steinberg examines her, we're through.

887
01:11:13,627 --> 01:11:15,251
- I'm through right now.
- You're not.

888
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:18,421
You gotta get in there.
Do anything, but stop Steinberg. Hurry.

889
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:21,876
I'll say. I'm hopping the next
banana boat for Central America.

890
01:11:22,052 --> 01:11:23,926
Hey, doc, where you going?

891
01:11:24,387 --> 01:11:26,427
Wait, doc. Wait.

892
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:32,802
It's all right with me. Go right ahead.
I'm not sleeping here tonight.

893
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:38,057
- It's Hi Hat.
- Nonsense. That's a horse.

894
01:11:38,235 --> 01:11:42,019
No, it's Hi Hat. We hide him in the closet
so the sheriff can't find him.

895
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,320
Is that so?
He's not going to find me either...

896
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:46,614
...because I'm leaving here
right away, boys.

897
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,445
Doc, doc, wait a minute, now.

898
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,158
- No, I'll see you again sometime.
- No, doc, please.

899
01:11:51,331 --> 01:11:54,036
See you again, just as soon
as I get my effects.

900
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:57,495
Old Hackenbush isn't gonna be
with you very long.

901
01:11:57,671 --> 01:12:02,131
- Doc, you can't walk out on us like this.
- I'll say I can't. I'm gonna run out.

902
01:12:03,468 --> 01:12:06,173
You can't go, doc.
If you walk out, where will Judy be?

903
01:12:06,346 --> 01:12:09,181
She won't be in jail,
and that's where I'll be if I stay here.

904
01:12:09,349 --> 01:12:10,594
Besides, what can I do?

905
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:14,302
- You've got to stop the examination.
- Not today I don't.

906
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:16,187
Are you a man or a mouse?

907
01:12:16,356 --> 01:12:19,476
You put a piece of cheese down there,
and you'll find out.

908
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,107
Well, it's been nice seeing you.

909
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:26,193
Oh, no, you don't.
You leave, it's over my dead body.

910
01:12:26,366 --> 01:12:28,157
Well, that's a pleasant way to travel.

911
01:12:28,326 --> 01:12:31,909
All right. Now, look, doc.
You can't leave Miss Judy in a fix like this.

912
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,989
- I know, but the sheriff...
- Doc, doc.

913
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:37,998
If you leave now,
Judy loses the sanitarium.

914
01:12:38,336 --> 01:12:39,581
All right. I'll stay.

915
01:12:39,754 --> 01:12:42,246
You're gonna stay?
I knew you'd do it, doc.

916
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:45,049
Next, we will see...

917
01:12:45,218 --> 01:12:47,010
Just a moment. Take your hands off her!

918
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:48,756
A fine doctor you are.

919
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:51,967
You're not supposed to touch a patient
without being sterilized.

920
01:12:52,142 --> 01:12:54,384
You don't see me running
an examination like that.

921
01:12:54,561 --> 01:12:56,470
No, that's true.

922
01:12:56,646 --> 01:12:58,639
And I think it would be very interesting...

923
01:12:58,815 --> 01:13:01,900
...to see just how Dr. Hackenbush
does conduct an examination.

924
01:13:02,068 --> 01:13:05,272
Splendid, splendid. Show them, doctor.

925
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,523
If you insist, I'll proceed.

926
01:13:17,334 --> 01:13:20,785
In case you've never done it,
this is known as washing your hands.

927
01:13:34,226 --> 01:13:36,598
I'd rather have it rusty than missing.

928
01:13:40,899 --> 01:13:44,066
You'll go a long ways to see
prettier drippings than those.

929
01:13:44,236 --> 01:13:47,936
Why sterilization? After all,
this is not an operation, you know?

930
01:13:48,115 --> 01:13:53,239
Not yet, but I may get hot and operate
on everybody in the joint, including you.

931
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,405
Come, come, doctor. Aren't you ready?

932
01:13:56,915 --> 01:13:59,584
Now, Mrs. Upjohn,
I guess I know my business.

933
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:01,744
Of course, that's just a guess
on my part...

934
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,837
...but at any rate, I know a thing
or two about cleanliness...

935
01:14:05,006 --> 01:14:08,541
...and that's more than I can say
for that mountain goat standing there.

936
01:14:11,596 --> 01:14:14,087
Come, doctor. We're waiting.

937
01:14:14,266 --> 01:14:16,887
All right. If you insist,
we'll proceed at once.

938
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,931
Now, Mrs. Upjohn,
I want you to take your arms...

939
01:14:20,105 --> 01:14:23,474
...and let them wave through the air
with the greatest of ease.

940
01:14:24,901 --> 01:14:26,609
Not too swiftly.

941
01:14:26,778 --> 01:14:29,898
- Like that, doctor?
- Yes, that's splendid.

942
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:32,280
How long do you want me
to do this, doctor?

943
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:34,942
Just until you fly away.

944
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,626
I told you guys to stay down
in that room with those pigeons.

945
01:14:54,222 --> 01:14:58,302
Dr. Hackenbush, tell me,
who sent for these men?

946
01:14:58,477 --> 01:15:01,643
You don't have to send for them.
You just rub a lamp, and they appear.

947
01:15:01,813 --> 01:15:04,138
- My name is Steinberg.
- Nix. Nix. That's Steinberg.

948
01:15:04,316 --> 01:15:08,016
Dr. Steinberg, by a strange coincidence,
this is another Dr. Steinberg.

949
01:15:08,195 --> 01:15:11,943
May I introduce my colleagues
and good friends, another Dr. Steinberg?

950
01:15:12,115 --> 01:15:14,155
This is a Dr. Steinberg, Dr. Steinberg.

951
01:15:14,326 --> 01:15:16,568
Dr. Steinberg and Mrs. Steinberg.

952
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:19,995
And, doctor, I'd like you
to meet another Dr. Steinberg.

953
01:15:20,332 --> 01:15:22,241
And that's Steinberg Jr.

954
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:26,664
If Dr. Hackenbush is not going to continue
with the examination, professor...

955
01:15:26,838 --> 01:15:30,338
...may we have your diagnosis, please?
- With pleasure.

956
01:15:30,509 --> 01:15:32,133
In all my years of medicine...

957
01:15:32,302 --> 01:15:35,671
In your years of medicine. You don't
know the first thing about medicine.

958
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:38,381
And don't point that beard at me.
It might go off.

959
01:15:38,558 --> 01:15:43,054
Dr. Steinberg, do you remember
your diagnosis?

960
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:46,681
Certainly. To begin with,
her pulse is absolutely normal.

961
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:48,685
- I challenge that.
- Challenge that?

962
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,652
- You take her pulse.
- Pulse?

963
01:15:50,821 --> 01:15:53,062
- Take her pulse!
- I don't do any pulse work.

964
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,363
I am an acute diagnostician.

965
01:15:55,534 --> 01:15:57,859
Take her pulse. Take her pulse!

966
01:15:58,537 --> 01:16:01,656
Oh, no, no, no. My purse, my purse,
my purse. He has my purse!

967
01:16:01,832 --> 01:16:04,204
You must forgive him.
He doesn't spell very well.

968
01:16:04,376 --> 01:16:07,045
Oh, dear. Come, gentlemen.
Let us begin.

969
01:16:07,212 --> 01:16:10,083
You shouldn't have done that.
Now we're all unsterilized.

970
01:16:10,257 --> 01:16:11,632
What's the matter with you?

971
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,222
Well, I must say,
I've seen quicker examinations.

972
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:25,387
Maybe, but you'll never see
a slipperier one.

973
01:16:25,564 --> 01:16:28,233
- Are you ready to proceed?
- We'll proceed immediately.

974
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,685
Doctor. And what do you expect
to do next?

975
01:16:31,862 --> 01:16:34,566
The next thing I think we should do
is wash our hands.

976
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:36,946
- You're absolutely right.
- Oh, I've never seen...

977
01:16:42,414 --> 01:16:45,617
- Oh, what is the matter with them?
- I don't know.

978
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:48,627
- What is this? Get away!
- Everything is going to be all right.

979
01:16:48,795 --> 01:16:51,582
Nurse, sterilization! Sterilization!

980
01:16:51,756 --> 01:16:54,508
- Are they mad? What is it?
- No, we're not mad.

981
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:57,167
We're just terribly hurt, that's all.

982
01:16:58,096 --> 01:17:01,595
Hey, just a moment. Just put
the gown on, not the nurse, huh?

983
01:17:01,766 --> 01:17:03,309
Come here.

984
01:17:04,978 --> 01:17:07,849
- How's it a dame like that never gets sick?
- But I am sick.

985
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:10,015
Doctor, will you pay attention to me?

986
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:13,027
You'll have to get in line.
There's three orders ahead of you.

987
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:16,445
That poor girl may be out there,
catching her death of cold.

988
01:17:16,615 --> 01:17:19,106
- Same nurse, sterilization.
- Doc, get away from there.

989
01:17:19,284 --> 01:17:22,285
- This is absolutely insane!
- That's what they said about Pasteur.

990
01:17:22,454 --> 01:17:25,621
This is ridiculous.
Put the patient in a horizontal position.

991
01:17:26,124 --> 01:17:29,291
- Oh, what are you gonna do now?
- Be careful. Be careful.

992
01:17:29,461 --> 01:17:32,213
I don't want to be examined anymore.
Do you hear me?

993
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,545
Doctor, where are you?

994
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,553
Oh, my. I want to get down.
You let me down this very moment.

995
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:40,966
Do you hear me?

996
01:17:41,181 --> 01:17:43,138
I'll get you down.

997
01:17:43,308 --> 01:17:45,846
I'll report this to Miss Standish.
You wait and see.

998
01:17:46,019 --> 01:17:49,637
What are you doing?
Get off there. Get off there!

999
01:17:53,151 --> 01:17:55,144
How do you like that, honey?

1000
01:17:55,779 --> 01:17:58,151
What are you doing? Give me that.

1001
01:17:58,323 --> 01:18:01,941
Get away from me. I don't want
to have my head massaged!

1002
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:06,163
In all my life, I haven't seen
such an examination!

1003
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:09,287
But there is one indisputable test.

1004
01:18:09,459 --> 01:18:10,657
- What?
- The x-ray!

1005
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:13,540
- X-ray!
- X-ray!

1006
01:18:13,713 --> 01:18:17,497
X-ray! All about the examination!

1007
01:18:17,676 --> 01:18:21,175
X-ray! All about the examination!

1008
01:18:21,346 --> 01:18:23,946
X-ray! X-ray!

1009
01:18:24,182 --> 01:18:25,382
X-ray!

1010
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,015
That's enough! I will call the police!

1011
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:33,939
I've never gone through
anything like this!

1012
01:19:05,056 --> 01:19:08,556
- I certainly messed things up for Judy.
- You messed things up?

1013
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:11,893
I suppose old Doc Hackenbush
didn't throw a nasty monkey wrench.

1014
01:19:12,063 --> 01:19:14,056
You no throw the monkey wrench.

1015
01:19:14,232 --> 01:19:15,561
I'm the guy that did it.

1016
01:19:15,734 --> 01:19:18,735
Now, listen.
It was nobody's fault but mine.

1017
01:19:19,196 --> 01:19:21,947
I don't want any more arguments.
It was all my fault.

1018
01:19:22,115 --> 01:19:24,072
I think he's right. It was his fault.

1019
01:19:24,242 --> 01:19:26,780
Oh, it was my fault, eh?
That's the thanks I get.

1020
01:19:26,953 --> 01:19:28,993
I get you the first shower
you had in years...

1021
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,121
...you turn on me
like a snake in the grass.

1022
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:33,996
- Someone's coming.
- The sheriff.

1023
01:19:42,219 --> 01:19:45,635
- Judy.
- Hello, Miss Judy.

1024
01:19:45,806 --> 01:19:48,593
- Hello. Hello.
- You're the prettiest sheriff I've ever seen.

1025
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:50,925
- Thought I was the sheriff?
- Taking no chances.

1026
01:19:51,102 --> 01:19:52,680
I just brought you these blankets.

1027
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:56,270
I thought it might make it
a little more comfortable living out here.

1028
01:19:56,441 --> 01:19:57,639
Get up. Get up.

1029
01:19:57,818 --> 01:20:00,487
Don't worry about our comfort.
We bungled your affairs.

1030
01:20:00,654 --> 01:20:01,934
You did your best, Gil.

1031
01:20:02,114 --> 01:20:04,023
Yes, and our best was none too good.

1032
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:07,235
Tell me, is the water still running
in the examination room?

1033
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:10,281
After tomorrow,
I'm afraid that's Mr. Morgan's worry.

1034
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:12,495
Morgan, he no got the sanitarium yet.

1035
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:15,287
A lot of things can happen
before tomorrow.

1036
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,868
The sanitarium doesn't matter anymore.

1037
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:21,296
Gil, you were right.
I've been taking things far too seriously.

1038
01:20:21,466 --> 01:20:24,752
It's much better this way.
Now I can be free. I won't be tied down.

1039
01:20:24,928 --> 01:20:28,712
I can enjoy myself and really laugh.

1040
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,135
Oh, Judy, please.

1041
01:20:30,308 --> 01:20:33,808
Don't cry, Miss Judy.
I feel sad, but I laugh.

1042
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:36,137
I laugh. Stuffy's laughing too. Look.

1043
01:20:36,314 --> 01:20:37,974
Go on and laugh, Stuffy.

1044
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:42,267
Hey, look. Look at Hackenapuss.
Laugh. Go on, laugh.

1045
01:20:43,155 --> 01:20:45,028
Where did that come from?

1046
01:20:50,162 --> 01:20:52,700
It can't be that bad, Judy.

1047
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,579
Look at those kids. Laughing, happy.

1048
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:04,001
Come on. You're just a kid.
Laugh. Be happy.

1049
01:31:20,584 --> 01:31:22,457
It's the sheriff.

1050
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:28,455
- Hey, you.
- I ain't done nothing.

1051
01:31:28,633 --> 01:31:30,792
You've got nothing on me.
My skirts are clean.

1052
01:31:30,969 --> 01:31:33,804
Yeah? This letter from Florida
says you're a horse doctor.

1053
01:31:35,432 --> 01:31:36,974
Put them all under arrest.

1054
01:31:37,142 --> 01:31:39,763
They won't run, sheriff,
if you break their legs.

1055
01:31:41,271 --> 01:31:42,813
Get that horse. Get that horse.

1056
01:31:44,858 --> 01:31:46,186
What's wrong with that horse?

1057
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:49,313
He goes wild every time
he sees Morgan or hears his voice.

1058
01:31:49,488 --> 01:31:51,480
Get him out.

1059
01:31:52,491 --> 01:31:56,358
Hey, come here, you.
Where do you think you're going?

1060
01:32:07,506 --> 01:32:09,000
You can't get away with this.

1061
01:32:13,637 --> 01:32:15,345
Never mind him. Get the horse.

1062
01:32:20,227 --> 01:32:21,970
Why, you!

1063
01:32:22,938 --> 01:32:25,226
Nice work, Stuffy.

1064
01:32:26,066 --> 01:32:29,067
Stop that horse!
Don't let him get out of here!

1065
01:32:29,236 --> 01:32:30,979
Did you see that horse jump?

1066
01:32:31,154 --> 01:32:34,072
And I'm doing some
pretty fancy jumping myself.

1067
01:32:35,909 --> 01:32:37,534
Let me off this rope!

1068
01:32:37,702 --> 01:32:40,538
I'll throw you all in jail!
Get me down! Get me out of here!

1069
01:32:40,705 --> 01:32:43,742
This is no way to treat the law.
You'll never get away with this!

1070
01:32:43,917 --> 01:32:45,660
I'll get you.

1071
01:32:48,338 --> 01:32:49,536
There he goes.

1072
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:55,338
If he's headed south,
I'd like to make a reservation.

1073
01:32:55,554 --> 01:32:57,712
Look at that horse.
He cleared the automobile.

1074
01:32:57,889 --> 01:32:59,087
I wish I could clear mine.

1075
01:32:59,266 --> 01:33:03,050
Darling, perhaps that's why he
never won a race. He's a jumper.

1076
01:33:03,228 --> 01:33:06,893
Am I a sap. I have a steeplechase horse,
and I don't know it.

1077
01:33:45,061 --> 01:33:48,430
We're gonna find that added starter
and see that he doesn't start.

1078
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:51,514
They're not pulling any fast ones.
Hi Hat's not running.

1079
01:33:51,693 --> 01:33:54,943
- But Hi Hat isn't a jumper.
- He was jumping plenty last night.

1080
01:33:55,113 --> 01:33:58,114
- But he can't beat your horse.
- Well, I'm not taking any chances.

1081
01:33:58,283 --> 01:34:00,739
My money is riding on Skee Ball,
and that's not all.

1082
01:34:00,911 --> 01:34:04,280
If Hi Hat wins,
we can kiss the sanitarium goodbye.

1083
01:34:04,456 --> 01:34:07,789
Well, Morgan, you got nothing
to worry about. Hi Hat's not on this track.

1084
01:34:07,959 --> 01:34:10,118
See he doesn't get on.
Put a man at every gate.

1085
01:34:10,295 --> 01:34:13,130
If that nag slips by you,
it means your job.

1086
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:30,355
Here. Keep me posted.

1087
01:34:38,782 --> 01:34:40,193
He's made it!
He's made it!

1088
01:34:40,367 --> 01:34:42,525
Go ahead, Stuffy!
Go to it. Good luck!

1089
01:34:42,702 --> 01:34:45,193
Ride them, cowboy,
or we're heading for the lockup.

1090
01:34:45,372 --> 01:34:46,914
Come on. We get a reserved seat.

1091
01:34:53,672 --> 01:34:55,664
- Gil!
- I got a man on every gate.

1092
01:34:55,841 --> 01:34:59,340
- There's no sign of them.
- See there's no sign of them till after.

1093
01:34:59,511 --> 01:35:02,263
Whoa, Hi Hat!
Whoa, boy! Hi Hat, whoa!

1094
01:35:04,307 --> 01:35:05,505
Hey, what you got in there?

1095
01:35:07,727 --> 01:35:10,645
If you believe in signs, Sherlock,
look at that ambulance.

1096
01:35:13,692 --> 01:35:16,728
- Now, wait a minute, sheriff!
- Don't you start anything, Stewart!

1097
01:35:19,823 --> 01:35:23,026
We'll just put this baby
under lock and key.

1098
01:35:24,578 --> 01:35:27,495
You keep searching for those other mugs.

1099
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:35,529
Stuffy.

1100
01:35:35,797 --> 01:35:37,706
What's the matter?

1101
01:35:38,592 --> 01:35:40,216
What's happened?

1102
01:35:40,385 --> 01:35:41,385
What?

1103
01:35:44,264 --> 01:35:46,422
Hi Hat's gone!

1104
01:35:47,559 --> 01:35:51,888
- The race is going to start!
- They won't start till we find Hi Hat.

1105
01:35:57,611 --> 01:36:00,481
Now, listen, son,
you're riding this race to win.

1106
01:36:00,655 --> 01:36:03,989
I don't care what you do as long
as the judges don't see you doing it.

1107
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:07,444
All right, men!
Go to your horses!

1108
01:36:16,588 --> 01:36:17,588
Soap!

1109
01:36:27,265 --> 01:36:31,310
<i>We are sorry for the delay, but</i>
<i>the horses are now coming on the track.</i>

1110
01:36:31,937 --> 01:36:33,265
Twenty-five minutes late!

1111
01:36:33,438 --> 01:36:35,478
<i>The horses are parading</i>
<i>past the grandstand.</i>

1112
01:36:35,649 --> 01:36:37,191
<i>Only 11 are headed postward.</i>

1113
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:39,932
<i>Hi Hat, the added starter, is missing.</i>

1114
01:36:40,112 --> 01:36:42,270
<i>This is the third running...</i>

1115
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:57,789
Hey, Stuffy! Stuffy!
Did you find him?

1116
01:36:57,963 --> 01:36:59,243
Did you find the ambulance?

1117
01:36:59,422 --> 01:37:01,380
Well, keep on looking.
We know it came in.

1118
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:04,041
<i>Now that the storm of hats</i>
<i>has subsided...</i>

1119
01:37:04,219 --> 01:37:07,469
<i>... the stewards have ordered</i>
<i>the track cleared for action.</i>

1120
01:37:07,639 --> 01:37:10,474
- Don't stop searching till you find them!
- Here you are, boss.

1121
01:37:10,642 --> 01:37:14,391
<i>- And the horses are back on parade</i>
<i>towards the starting point.</i>

1122
01:37:14,563 --> 01:37:17,647
<i>They're going back now,</i>
<i>up to the starting post.</i>

1123
01:37:17,816 --> 01:37:21,683
<i>And everyone is getting his own hat,</i>
<i>we hope.</i>

1124
01:37:22,362 --> 01:37:25,648
<i>The horses are coming back</i>
<i>to the starter now. They're very fractious.</i>

1125
01:37:25,824 --> 01:37:27,982
<i>They are giving the boys</i>
<i>quite a bit of trouble.</i>

1126
01:37:29,953 --> 01:37:32,574
<i>First Legion is acting very badly...</i>

1127
01:37:32,747 --> 01:37:35,665
Free parking! Here you are!
Free parking!

1128
01:37:36,293 --> 01:37:38,831
Get your free parking!
Come on! Come on, this way!

1129
01:37:39,004 --> 01:37:41,577
<i>They're coming up this time,</i>
<i>almost in an even line.</i>

1130
01:37:41,756 --> 01:37:44,164
<i>The starter has his flag up,</i>
<i>and it looks like...</i>

1131
01:37:44,342 --> 01:37:45,623
<i>Wait a minute!</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

1132
01:37:45,802 --> 01:37:48,340
<i>A horserace or an automobile race?</i>

1133
01:37:49,848 --> 01:37:51,472
Hold those horses!

1134
01:37:51,641 --> 01:37:53,219
Hold it! Hold it!

1135
01:37:59,524 --> 01:38:02,359
Plenty of room. Nice fresh parking today.
Right ahead, folks.

1136
01:38:20,212 --> 01:38:22,881
You girls got anything on for tonight?

1137
01:38:23,965 --> 01:38:25,765
Hey! Hey!

1138
01:38:26,218 --> 01:38:28,709
- Get that one!
- Hey, get off!

1139
01:39:04,297 --> 01:39:05,957
Going my way?

1140
01:39:09,427 --> 01:39:11,337
Get them out!
Get them out of here!

1141
01:39:15,308 --> 01:39:17,135
Hey, Stuffy, did you find Hi Hat?

1142
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:19,718
Well, keep looking.
He must be around somewheres.

1143
01:39:31,408 --> 01:39:34,859
Get that horse out of there!
There's been a terrible wreck!

1144
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:38,028
Come on! Hurry up! Help me!

1145
01:39:55,265 --> 01:39:59,049
- Come on, we've got no time to lose.
- Is she alive?

1146
01:40:04,191 --> 01:40:07,441
- Get going, sheriff, I'll take care of her.
- All right.

1147
01:40:18,163 --> 01:40:20,321
<i>- Well, here we are again.</i>
- Come on!

1148
01:40:20,499 --> 01:40:23,499
Get them off
before something else happens.

1149
01:40:23,668 --> 01:40:26,919
- Turn that horse around.
- <i>It looks like he'll send them away.</i>

1150
01:40:27,088 --> 01:40:29,046
<i>- Yes, yes...</i>
- Now, easy, easy.

1151
01:40:29,216 --> 01:40:31,623
<i>And now they go!</i>

1152
01:40:35,013 --> 01:40:37,171
- At last.
- <i>Flying Demon is third.</i>

1153
01:40:37,349 --> 01:40:39,674
<i>Sun Helmet is fourth, and Green Goddess.</i>

1154
01:40:39,851 --> 01:40:42,425
<i>Skee Ball showing the way</i>
<i>in the center of the track...</i>

1155
01:40:42,604 --> 01:40:45,605
<i>... by two lengths.</i>
<i>Sun Helmet is second.</i>

1156
01:40:45,774 --> 01:40:48,810
<i>Green Goddess is third,</i>
<i>and Flying Demon is fourth.</i>

1157
01:40:49,402 --> 01:40:53,614
<i>Now they're going around the first turn</i>
<i>with Skee Ball in front by two lengths.</i>

1158
01:40:53,782 --> 01:40:55,691
<i>First Legion is second by a head.</i>

1159
01:40:55,867 --> 01:40:57,243
<i>Wait a minute!</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

1160
01:40:57,869 --> 01:40:59,067
What is...?
What happened?

1161
01:40:59,746 --> 01:41:02,202
Get me the riot squad!

1162
01:41:02,541 --> 01:41:05,577
- Oh, Mr. Morgan, don't get excited.
- I'm not excited! Shut up!

1163
01:41:09,005 --> 01:41:10,630
<i>Quiet, please. Your attention.</i>

1164
01:41:11,758 --> 01:41:14,214
<i>Quiet, please! Your attention!</i>

1165
01:41:14,386 --> 01:41:15,714
Stuffy!

1166
01:41:15,887 --> 01:41:19,470
<i>The stewards have ruled this</i>
<i>a false start...</i>

1167
01:41:20,058 --> 01:41:23,759
<i>... and have ordered the horses back</i>
<i>to the starting post.</i>

1168
01:41:24,104 --> 01:41:26,856
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>if you will all...</i>

1169
01:41:27,023 --> 01:41:28,566
Stuffy, scram!

1170
01:41:28,733 --> 01:41:31,853
<i>Who knows, we may yet have</i>
<i>a horserace this afternoon.</i>

1171
01:41:32,028 --> 01:41:35,444
<i>Horses are back at the starting point.</i>

1172
01:41:35,615 --> 01:41:40,242
<i>And now the boys are turning them about.</i>
<i>They're very nervous, very fractious.</i>

1173
01:41:40,412 --> 01:41:42,239
<i>They're having quite a bit of trouble.</i>

1174
01:41:42,414 --> 01:41:43,956
Get that wagon off of here!

1175
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,912
Get off!

1176
01:42:07,606 --> 01:42:09,432
Get it off!

1177
01:42:12,110 --> 01:42:14,815
Hi Hat, he got him away from me!
I don't know where he is!

1178
01:42:14,988 --> 01:42:16,862
What do you think that is, stupid?

1179
01:42:18,909 --> 01:42:20,782
- Number 7!
- Somebody's gonna pay for this!

1180
01:42:20,952 --> 01:42:22,197
That's Hi Hat!

1181
01:42:23,038 --> 01:42:26,621
<i>They're coming up to the start this time,</i>
<i>and the starter has his flag raised.</i>

1182
01:42:26,792 --> 01:42:28,665
<i>And now they go!</i>

1183
01:42:29,586 --> 01:42:31,875
<i>Here comes Hi Hat!</i>

1184
01:42:32,506 --> 01:42:33,786
<i>And he's in the race!</i>

1185
01:42:33,965 --> 01:42:35,376
Come on! Hoof it!

1186
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:38,551
<i>Skee Ball going to the front,</i>
<i>First Legion is second...</i>

1187
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:41,472
<i>... Flying Demon is third,</i>
<i>Sun Helmet is fourth...</i>

1188
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,050
<i>... and Green Goddess is fifth.</i>

1189
01:42:43,225 --> 01:42:45,098
<i>Now there goes Hi Hat into contention.</i>

1190
01:42:45,268 --> 01:42:47,842
<i>He's picking up the field,</i>
<i>he's moving up between horses.</i>

1191
01:42:48,021 --> 01:42:50,808
<i>And look at him go!</i>
<i>He's moving up there at the leader.</i>

1192
01:42:50,982 --> 01:42:53,652
<i>And Skee Ball's still in front,</i>
<i>pressing into second.</i>

1193
01:42:53,819 --> 01:42:57,484
<i>But here comes Hi Hat between horses,</i>
<i>and now he's challenging the leader.</i>

1194
01:42:59,449 --> 01:43:01,489
<i>Skee Ball in front</i>
<i>by a length and one half.</i>

1195
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:03,985
<i>Hi Hat is second by three-quarters</i>
<i>of a length.</i>

1196
01:43:04,162 --> 01:43:06,404
<i>First Legion is third</i>
<i>by a length and one half...</i>

1197
01:43:06,581 --> 01:43:09,535
<i>... and Flying Demon is fourth.</i>
<i>Now Skee Ball is going out a bit.</i>

1198
01:43:09,709 --> 01:43:13,328
<i>And they're coming to the first fence now,</i>
<i>and Skee Ball takes it...</i>

1199
01:43:13,505 --> 01:43:15,877
<i>... but Hi Hat refuses.</i>
<i>He's turning back.</i>

1200
01:43:16,049 --> 01:43:19,632
<i>But wait a minute, wait a minute.</i>
<i>He's going to try it. There he goes.</i>

1201
01:43:19,803 --> 01:43:22,009
<i>He's going after it this time,</i>
<i>and he's over!</i>

1202
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:24,173
Oh, your idea worked, Judy!

1203
01:43:24,349 --> 01:43:27,765
<i>Flying Demon is third by three-quarters</i>
<i>of a length. Sun Helmet in fourth.</i>

1204
01:43:27,936 --> 01:43:30,308
Oh, he's lost Morgan's picture!

1205
01:43:31,189 --> 01:43:33,182
<i>And he's going up on the outside</i>
<i>this time...</i>

1206
01:43:33,358 --> 01:43:37,356
<i>... and here he is at the leader! It's Skee</i>
<i>Ball in front. Here comes Skee Ball...</i>

1207
01:43:37,529 --> 01:43:39,771
Can you shout like Morgan?

1208
01:43:39,948 --> 01:43:42,154
No, but Morgan can.

1209
01:43:43,076 --> 01:43:45,745
<i>- Third by three-quarters of a length.</i>
<i>Skee Ball on the outside.</i>

1210
01:43:45,912 --> 01:43:49,827
<i>And Hi Hat on the rail,</i>
<i>with Flying Demon third...</i>

1211
01:43:50,792 --> 01:43:52,701
Something's happened
to the loudspeaker.

1212
01:44:06,057 --> 01:44:08,264
- Let me take a look.
- Give me those glasses...

1213
01:44:08,435 --> 01:44:09,715
<i>It's you! Officer!</i>

1214
01:44:16,026 --> 01:44:18,481
You take care of Judy,
and I'll take care of Morgan.

1215
01:44:38,089 --> 01:44:40,627
I hope the judges didn't see that.

1216
01:44:46,431 --> 01:44:48,922
Mind telling the radio audience
what a heel you are?

1217
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,927
Come back later.
I've had enough of y...

1218
01:44:51,436 --> 01:44:54,852
<i>If the police can 't handle you,</i>
<i>I'll handle you myself!</i>

1219
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:57,932
Keep that man away from me,
do you understand?

1220
01:45:03,824 --> 01:45:06,030
Get down there! And stay there!

1221
01:45:06,201 --> 01:45:08,158
And see that
I'm not disturbed again today!

1222
01:45:12,874 --> 01:45:14,119
Get out of here!

1223
01:45:14,292 --> 01:45:15,703
<i>Get out of here!</i>

1224
01:45:39,234 --> 01:45:42,021
Oh, we've got him!
He won't get away this time!

1225
01:45:47,159 --> 01:45:49,400
- They're both down!
- Stuffy's down!

1226
01:45:59,671 --> 01:46:01,249
Skee Ball's in the lead!

1227
01:46:16,438 --> 01:46:18,015
- Smell this.
- Oh, get away!

1228
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:20,515
<i>I don 't wanna smell anything!</i>
<i>Get him out of here!</i>

1229
01:46:20,692 --> 01:46:23,527
<i>Come on! How many men</i>
<i>does it take to do this?</i>

1230
01:46:23,695 --> 01:46:26,364
Come on, Skee Ball!
Come on, Skee Ball!

1231
01:46:26,531 --> 01:46:28,275
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

1232
01:46:33,497 --> 01:46:37,541
Skee Ball wins! He wins at everything!
Let me out of here.

1233
01:46:41,087 --> 01:46:44,706
Okay, sheriff, what are your rates
for a cell with southern exposure?

1234
01:46:44,883 --> 01:46:48,133
Gil, Hi Hat couldn't have tried harder.

1235
01:46:48,303 --> 01:46:49,714
We were just unlucky.

1236
01:46:54,434 --> 01:46:57,720
Great race, Skee Ball.
Great race, Skee Ball.

1237
01:47:00,941 --> 01:47:03,811
Get out of here!
Get him out of here!

1238
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,785
- Why, it's number 7!
- Hi Hat's the winner.

1239
01:47:20,961 --> 01:47:24,626
- Hi Hat wins! Cancel that reservation.
- It's Hi Hat!

1240
01:47:24,798 --> 01:47:27,752
Gil, come on! Come on,
I want to put the wreath on the winner!

1241
01:47:27,926 --> 01:47:31,010
One more yell out of you, and he'd
have jumped over the grandstand.

1242
01:47:31,179 --> 01:47:32,971
- Stuffy!
- Stuffy, you were wonderful!

1243
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:35,381
- Oh, boy!
- I haven't seen so much mudslinging...

1244
01:47:35,559 --> 01:47:37,765
...since the last election.

1245
01:47:41,606 --> 01:47:44,393
Come on, boy! Hi Hat!

1246
01:47:46,695 --> 01:47:48,522
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

1247
01:47:49,573 --> 01:47:51,612
Hallelujah!

1248
01:48:24,858 --> 01:48:26,851
Emily, I have a little confession to make.

1249
01:48:27,027 --> 01:48:28,687
I really am a horse doctor.

1250
01:48:28,862 --> 01:48:31,898
But marry me,
and I'll never look at any other horse.

1251
