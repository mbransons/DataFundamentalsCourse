1
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,860
Good morning, beauty.

2
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:08,699
Let's go, or we'll never
leave on time.

3
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,120
I'm totally ready.

4
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:14,914
Come on. I'll make you some waffles.

5
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,666
- Mother....
- Caitlin.

6
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:18,709
Blueberries!

7
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:22,296
Hey, Cooper.

8
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:24,257
You want some breakfast too?

9
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,967
You want some waffles?

10
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:27,885
Good boy.

11
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,038
Look. They're at it again.

12
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,207
Christ, that's twice in....

13
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,042
When did they move in?

14
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,503
Three weeks. What's their name?

15
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:06,591
Feur, I think. Psych department.
Figures, they're all nuts.

16
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:15,725
She's awake.

17
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:18,519
We'll be quiet.

18
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:19,979
Quick and quiet.

19
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:23,066
I don't want to be either.

20
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:29,906
- When's she out of here?
- Norman Spencer!

21
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:34,368
All right, I can't stand
the rejection. I'm going for a run.

22
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:37,288
Hey, you okay?

23
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,123
Yeah.

24
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,127
Come on, Pooper. Let's go.

25
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,131
We'll have to leave by 11
if we want to beat the traffic.

26
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,967
Eleven o'clock.

27
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:18,788
You know, you can call me...

28
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:20,873
...whenever you want.

29
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,917
Sweetheart...

30
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:26,712
...I've known this day was coming
for a long time.

31
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:29,882
I have Norman, and the garden
and the new house.

32
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:31,801
You really don't have to worry.

33
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,137
- I'm just saying--
- Really.

34
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:35,847
Okay.

35
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:42,311
Mom?

36
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:43,980
Mom?

37
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:45,773
Mother?

38
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:49,026
I have to go.

39
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:56,576
Honey, if I don't get you out of here
quick, they'll make you enroll.

40
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:58,619
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

41
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:00,496
- Bye.
- Bye.

42
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:02,206
Come home often.

43
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:03,750
Call your mom.

44
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,294
- Beatrice, it's nice to meet you.
- Bye.

45
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:10,089
- You take care of each other.
- I won't go to a bar without her.

46
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:11,966
I'm just kidding.

47
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,053
Bye.

48
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:24,270
Well, I almost made it.

49
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:52,131
What are you reading?

50
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:56,469
"Genetic Repair Mechanisms
in Eukaryotic Organisms."

51
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,930
Eukaryotic. How is it?

52
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:00,807
Excellent.

53
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,351
Oh, a couple of...

54
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:08,815
...Swedish sailor cells just gang-
divided a virginal cheerleader cell.

55
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,529
Almost there.

56
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:22,245
- If you have to work....
- No, no. Just let me get this.

57
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,916
Okay, almost.

58
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,377
There.

59
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:31,921
How's it going?

60
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,716
Great. I think we cracked it.

61
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,884
The prenatal thing?

62
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:39,470
Yeah, I targeted repair.

63
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,558
You are so brilliant.

64
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:45,852
Yep.

65
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,520
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk...

66
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,188
...Norman Spencer.

67
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,274
Yes!

68
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,737
How are you?

69
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,572
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

70
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:00,450
I am. Yeah, really.

71
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,745
It's okay if you're not, you know.

72
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:06,247
To tell you the truth, I'm...

73
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:08,082
...excited.

74
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,959
Really?

75
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:13,963
Yeah, I'm gonna get my life back.
Get some time for myself.

76
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:16,174
Some time for us.

77
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:22,555
Did a great job.

78
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:24,474
She's a good kid.

79
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,267
We did.

80
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:34,108
Just us now.

81
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:37,153
I know.

82
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:41,282
Tired?

83
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:44,577
Nope.

84
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:47,747
Want to fool around?

85
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:49,624
Yep.

86
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,276
Jesus.

87
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,534
What is he doing to her?

88
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,953
- I guess they're making up.
- Wait.

89
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:29,163
Leave it open.

90
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:32,834
Think we can take 'em?

91
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,335
It's worth a try.

92
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:52,311
Do the brilliant Norman stuff
some more.

93
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,070
And speak up.

94
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,818
Oh.

95
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,136
Hello?

96
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:18,476
Ouch! Ow!

97
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:22,271
Hello?

98
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:30,530
Mrs. Feur?

99
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,703
Hello?

100
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,665
Are you all right?

101
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,130
He's so....

102
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:49,257
It's too much...

103
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,467
...and I can't....

104
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:54,095
I can't breathe.

105
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,431
And I'm afraid.

106
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,725
What? What are you afraid of?

107
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:01,227
That one day I'll just...

108
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,312
...disappear.

109
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:07,316
Is there something I can do?

110
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:08,651
Can I...?

111
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:11,070
I've never even met you.

112
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,905
I know. I'm sorry.

113
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,115
I've been consumed.

114
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:17,201
This fence...

115
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:19,454
...it's so....

116
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:24,959
I'm sorry. Listen, would you like
to come over for coffee, or--?

117
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,919
Oh, God, he's back.

118
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:29,922
I'm sorry. Please forget what I said.

119
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:32,800
I don't even know you!
Please!

120
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:53,738
She sounded...

121
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:55,531
- ...terrified.
- Of what?

122
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,408
Of him, I think.

123
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:58,826
Did she say that?

124
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:00,787
More or less.

125
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:04,165
I want to go over there.
Let's go and--

126
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,042
- Why?
- To see if she's all right--

127
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,463
Honey, we're not going to march over
to our new neighbors and accuse them--

128
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:15,176
- That's not what I'm suggesting.
- Especially since they'll keep us up...

129
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:16,677
...with their sexual olympics.

130
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,721
What if something happened to her?

131
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:21,140
- Nothing will happen.
- I'd never forgive....

132
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:24,018
Honey, people argue.

133
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:26,020
People fight.

134
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:29,107
It's not our business.

135
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,953
- I've got to work tonight.
- I know.

136
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:46,624
This conference is the first
big preview of my paper.

137
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,544
I've just got to stay focused
a little while longer.

138
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,589
This is what I've been working for.

139
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:56,134
I just wish you could have heard her.

140
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:57,844
I'll tell you what I'll do.

141
00:15:58,052 --> 00:16:01,097
I'll call Harvey Tomes tomorrow
in the psych department...

142
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,226
...and I'll see what I can
find out about him.

143
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:06,978
Promise?

144
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,813
Yeah, I promise.

145
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:06,329
Hey, lady!

146
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:08,372
What are you doing?

147
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:10,958
Looking for you.

148
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:14,003
What are you doing?

149
00:17:14,462 --> 00:17:17,882
Just trying to drop off this
welcome thing for the new neighbors.

150
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:19,133
Not home?

151
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:20,635
Guess not.

152
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:24,680
- You are so good at this.
- If I were, I'd have done it weeks ago.

153
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,975
I gave my neighbors wine
that someone left at my house.

154
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:31,229
- Are you staying?
- Just came by to see how you're doing.

155
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:33,439
Good. I'm good.

156
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:35,650
Are you?

157
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:40,738
Why does everyone
find that so surprising?

158
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:43,699
Because your only daughter
just left for college...

159
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,077
...who you're extremely close with.

160
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:47,620
I'd be tripping.

161
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:48,830
Oh, right.

162
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,667
You had a hell of a year too.
The move, the new house...

163
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:53,876
...the garden.

164
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:55,169
The car.

165
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:57,255
A minor setback.

166
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:58,631
Was that a year ago?

167
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,174
This week.

168
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:01,759
Wow. Now Caitlin.

169
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:03,302
Big stress stuff.

170
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:04,887
Okay.

171
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:06,597
I'm a little tender.

172
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,850
Good. You're human.

173
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:12,729
And so far this week, my big task
is to take pictures of my roses...

174
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:14,647
...for the garden club.

175
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:18,401
Got here just in time, didn't I?

176
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:20,194
Brought you something.

177
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,363
It's Kambucha mushroom tea.

178
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:25,366
It soothes heartache
and promotes psychic wellness.

179
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:28,828
- Floriana suggested it.
- So you discuss me with your psychic?

180
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:32,331
No, and she's not really a psychic.
Just an enlightened spirit.

181
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,541
Like me.

182
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,544
That's worse.
You're gossiping about me.

183
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:41,340
Notice anything different?

184
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,427
Oh, my God. You bought it!

185
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:45,511
Yep.

186
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,721
Nice.

187
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:49,390
It's a beautiful thing, alimony.

188
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,933
You lose a husband...

189
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:52,643
...get a car.

190
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:55,188
- Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
- Absolutely.

191
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:56,564
Cool.

192
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:58,858
I have to run. You take care.

193
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:00,735
Thanks for the tea.

194
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:39,899
Norman.

195
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,153
Norman.

196
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:45,947
- Norman!
- What?

197
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:48,449
Come here. You have to see this.

198
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:54,956
- What's the matter?
- Look.

199
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:00,920
What, Claire?

200
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:05,800
I thought I saw....

201
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:08,136
- I--
- What?

202
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:11,305
- I thought I saw something.
- Jesus Christ!

203
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:38,082
Ow.

204
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:02,041
Hi, is Caitlin there?

205
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,877
Any idea when she'll be back?

206
00:22:08,464 --> 00:22:10,758
You be sure to tell her I called?

207
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,593
Thanks, Beatrice.

208
00:22:14,804 --> 00:22:16,139
Well, that's a first.

209
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:18,224
Cooper, come on.

210
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,934
Get your ball.

211
00:22:21,477 --> 00:22:22,854
What's the matter?

212
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:26,816
Cooper, it's your favorite ball.

213
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:08,149
- Hello?
- Hi.

214
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:11,527
I'm stuck here for another
couple of hours. Sorry.

215
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:14,197
Unless you want me to come home?

216
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,533
No. No, it's fine.

217
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:19,077
You sure?

218
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:24,290
Claire?

219
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,000
Huh?

220
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:28,461
Oh, absolutely. Take your time.

221
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,129
See you soon. Love you.

222
00:23:30,338 --> 00:23:32,215
Love you. Bye.

223
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:42,308
Cooper!

224
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:48,106
Cooper!

225
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:56,239
Fine. Have it your way.

226
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,880
We use different kinds.
Now we're using halothane.

227
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:56,424
Halothane? Is that a sedative?

228
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:57,842
It's a dissociative.

229
00:24:58,051 --> 00:25:01,095
It paralyzes motor function
but leaves her conscious.

230
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:04,057
She can't move
but knows what's going on.

231
00:25:04,265 --> 00:25:06,601
- Hi, Mrs. Spencer.
- Hi, Teddy.

232
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:10,229
- How long does that last?
- Five minutes.

233
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:13,024
- Sometimes three.
- Can it be used on all mammals?

234
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:17,403
Yeah, any procedure where you want
to get the patient immobile, pain-free.

235
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:18,446
- Hey.
- Hi.

236
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:20,573
Hi. What are you doing here?

237
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:21,949
- Are you okay?
- I....

238
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:24,452
I heard noises.

239
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:28,247
- What kind of noises? Where?
- At the house. I was scared.

240
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:30,750
- Did you call the police?
- No.

241
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:33,669
I'll have the police
check on the house while I'm gone.

242
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:35,421
Oh, great.

243
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,342
"Could you check in on my wife?
She's hearing voices."

244
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,219
Wait till that gets around.

245
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:44,806
I'll be in New Haven for the
conference. I want you to feel safe.

246
00:25:45,014 --> 00:25:46,349
I do.

247
00:25:46,557 --> 00:25:49,227
I'm sure it was just...

248
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:51,646
...nothing.

249
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:55,566
Did you call about the Feurs?

250
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:57,652
Oh, yeah.

251
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,781
Harvey says the guy's harmless.
Wouldn't hurt a flea.

252
00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:04,450
Warren. Warren Feur.

253
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:06,452
What about her?

254
00:26:07,954 --> 00:26:09,747
I know he told me....

255
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:11,958
Oh.

256
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,836
I met Schumway today.

257
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:17,255
Who wrote that book you love.

258
00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:21,134
They were doing some spiel
for the chemistry department...

259
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:23,344
...so Bob Shine introduces us.

260
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:27,181
You'll love this.
He looks right at me...

261
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,892
...and congratulates me
on Spencer's Theorem.

262
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:32,645
He didn't know your father was dead?

263
00:26:33,187 --> 00:26:34,188
He knew.

264
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:37,442
Oh, Norman.

265
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:40,278
What?

266
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:42,780
You're so sensitive about that.

267
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,282
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

268
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,576
You always overreact.

269
00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:51,372
I'll have to watch that, won't I?

270
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,341
Was it Mary?

271
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,760
Mrs. Feur.

272
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:06,429
Warren and Mary?

273
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,015
Yeah.

274
00:27:09,223 --> 00:27:10,767
Mary. That's it.

275
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,187
I'm gonna do some work.

276
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,078
Hello?

277
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:56,706
Mrs. Feur?

278
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:14,409
Can I help you?

279
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:16,619
Oh, yes.

280
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:19,247
Hi.

281
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm Claire Spencer, from next door.

282
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:25,086
Nice to meet you.

283
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:28,923
I wanted to stop by and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

284
00:30:32,176 --> 00:30:35,805
Thank you, but this really isn't
a good time. I'm running late.

285
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:38,099
Is your wife home?

286
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:40,935
No, she isn't.

287
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:44,147
When will she be back?

288
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:46,315
I have to go.

289
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:49,277
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.

290
00:30:58,619 --> 00:30:59,579
What's he doing?

291
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:00,872
Eating dinner.

292
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,290
Alone.

293
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:04,375
TV dinner.

294
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,002
That's bad.

295
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:08,921
That's my shiatsu guy.

296
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,051
Listen, call me back if he starts in
on some serial-killer dessert...

297
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:15,053
...like ladyfingers.

298
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:17,597
- You got it.
- Bye.

299
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:21,559
Where did you go?

300
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,932
Shit!

301
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,130
Jesus, Claire.

302
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:16,257
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was looking--

303
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,259
- Spying.
- Spying on Mr. Feur.

304
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:20,386
- How come you're not dressed?
- Dressed?

305
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:22,513
Dinner with Stan.

306
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:24,557
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

307
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:27,685
- We're going to be--
- Fashionably five minutes late.

308
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:29,854
Are you saying he murdered his wife?

309
00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:32,148
Is that so ridiculous?
She was terrified...

310
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:35,610
...and now she doesn't answer
the door, but her car's in the garage.

311
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,488
Maybe she was out,
or in bed with the flu.

312
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:41,866
- Or maybe she was abducted by aliens.
- Who are you calling?

313
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:45,453
- Restaurant.
- We're not at the center of the bridge.

314
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,705
You can't get service
until the center.

315
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:50,416
I know we're not at the center.

316
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:54,128
There. See?

317
00:33:54,962 --> 00:33:57,006
Well, that's a relief.

318
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:58,216
Hi, Stan.

319
00:33:58,424 --> 00:34:00,802
Hey, Claire. Norman.

320
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,096
- Sorry we're late.
- It's my fault.

321
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:04,430
We just got here.

322
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:07,225
- Where's the new squeeze?
- Here I am.

323
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,935
- This is--
- Elena?

324
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:10,603
Oh, my God. Claire!

325
00:34:10,812 --> 00:34:12,814
I don't believe it!

326
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:16,818
- This is--
- We know each other.

327
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:19,487
- Norman.
- Hello, Norman. How do you do?

328
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:21,072
Claire, look at you!

329
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,865
You look beautiful.

330
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:27,787
Here was this brilliant conductor
in purple bikini briefs...

331
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:30,331
...with no bangs...

332
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:35,002
...cursing his ass off in Finnish.

333
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:37,213
Oh, Claire.

334
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:39,799
I made an honest woman of her.

335
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:42,343
How long have you been in Vermont?

336
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,512
Oh, well, Norman grew up here.

337
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:49,684
Remember Beau Flynn, head of cardio
at the hospital? He was just sacked.

338
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:52,186
I just dropped her off at college.

339
00:34:52,395 --> 00:34:55,690
He was involved in some stalking
incident. An intern, some girl.

340
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:57,233
We're getting so old!

341
00:34:57,442 --> 00:35:00,445
They don't screw around
with that anymore.

342
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:05,032
- When did we last get together?
- New York.

343
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:08,036
- Of course. Right after--
- Right after Michael died.

344
00:35:08,244 --> 00:35:09,704
- Michael who?
- Marlov.

345
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:11,622
Claire's first husband.

346
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:13,541
- Oh, the musician.
- Yeah.

347
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,710
You know, we all toured together.

348
00:35:17,253 --> 00:35:19,005
Have you heard her play?

349
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:20,506
No.

350
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:23,092
No, I....

351
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:26,220
I would sit on-stage...

352
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:29,599
...during Claire's solo...

353
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:33,895
...and I mean, truly, I had tears
streaming down my face.

354
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:36,189
I mean, she's fabulous.

355
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:38,066
So why did you stop?

356
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:40,193
Oh....

357
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:43,654
Well, one night, after a concert...

358
00:35:43,863 --> 00:35:47,408
...I met a dashing, handsome...

359
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:50,661
...genius scientist...

360
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,707
...and three months later,
I was married.

361
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:59,545
Is that when you guys
moved up to Vermont?

362
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:02,965
No, we were living in Boston...

363
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:05,385
...when Norman was offered a position.

364
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:06,886
A position.

365
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:09,764
The DuPont Chair in genetics.

366
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,560
I see. So now you're teaching
at your father's school here.

367
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:16,479
I actually don't...

368
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:18,523
...do much teaching anymore.

369
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:20,775
I run a research project.

370
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:22,485
Oh.

371
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:29,200
Norman's father had this old stuffy--

372
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:32,286
--stately place on a lake.

373
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:35,289
- Which we're renovating.
- Practically gutted.

374
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:36,958
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did.

375
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,167
"Gutted."

376
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:43,089
- Wait till you see it. It's beautiful.
- It is beautiful. You'll see it.

377
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:45,091
It's haunted.

378
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:46,718
No.

379
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:48,010
Is it really?

380
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:50,138
Claire's hearing things.

381
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:52,890
What? What are you hearing?

382
00:36:58,187 --> 00:36:59,439
I, um....

383
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,774
I don't know. I heard...

384
00:37:01,983 --> 00:37:04,360
...voices, whispering....

385
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:06,612
A picture fell.

386
00:37:06,821 --> 00:37:10,324
You know, I completely believe
in all that.

387
00:37:11,117 --> 00:37:12,118
You do?

388
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:13,327
I do.

389
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:15,913
Wait a minute.
Who do you think it is?

390
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,709
I know exactly who it is.

391
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:22,920
It's my old man.

392
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:26,007
He's pissed about us
dicking around with the house.

393
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:56,954
Ow.

394
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:40,535
Claire.

395
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:42,412
Jesus....

396
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:44,580
It's all right.

397
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:47,667
Calm down, Claire.

398
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,585
It's okay.

399
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:01,097
Whose idea was it?

400
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:02,890
Mine. His.

401
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:05,017
We both thought....

402
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:08,104
I didn't want to come here.

403
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:10,732
- Then why did you?
- He was worried about me.

404
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,358
- Your husband?
- Yes.

405
00:41:12,608 --> 00:41:16,571
I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me
full of Prozac or lithium...

406
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:18,823
...so he can live out his life
in peace.

407
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:21,034
- Do you really think so?
- No.

408
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:22,785
Are you on medication?

409
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:25,705
No. Well, Valium.

410
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:27,248
For sleeping.

411
00:41:27,457 --> 00:41:28,875
Having trouble sleeping?

412
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,585
Sometimes.

413
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:32,420
When I get anxious.

414
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:35,590
Do you get anxious only at night?

415
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,218
No, I only take Valium at night.

416
00:41:39,427 --> 00:41:40,928
For sleeping.

417
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,182
Why do you get anxious?

418
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:46,350
I don't know.

419
00:41:46,726 --> 00:41:49,103
Why do you think
your husband's worried?

420
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,105
Because....

421
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:53,941
I don't know.

422
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:58,362
Because ever since Caitlin left--

423
00:41:58,571 --> 00:42:01,616
Ever since my daughter left
for school...

424
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:04,202
...there have been....

425
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:07,872
I've been....

426
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:10,166
Why is this so hard?

427
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,503
Here. Have a fireball.

428
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:18,758
Thank you.

429
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:22,220
It's hard because I'm
a complete stranger...

430
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,348
...and you're talking about
incredibly personal things.

431
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:30,103
Besides, most people, when they
come the first time, are wondering...

432
00:42:30,853 --> 00:42:32,980
...if I think they're crazy.

433
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:35,608
Don't worry. I'm required...

434
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:38,403
...to have three sessions
before I can commit.

435
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:41,989
That was a joke.

436
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:53,418
These are good. They're hot.

437
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:57,296
There's a ghost in my house.

438
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:03,594
I saw her in the water, beside me...

439
00:43:03,803 --> 00:43:05,012
...in the bathtub.

440
00:43:05,555 --> 00:43:06,848
What does she look like?

441
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,102
She looked like...

442
00:43:11,352 --> 00:43:12,478
...me.

443
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:15,565
Oh.

444
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:18,109
Only she had green eyes.

445
00:43:19,026 --> 00:43:20,820
Any idea who she is?

446
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,283
Maybe. But I'd rather not say
just yet.

447
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:26,701
Fine.

448
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,127
What do you think I should do?

449
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:37,670
Try to contact her.

450
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:42,341
Communicate with her somehow.
Find out what she wants.

451
00:43:43,676 --> 00:43:47,221
What do you want me to do?
Go buy a Ouija board?

452
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,476
Ah.

453
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:55,980
Are we hoping the ghost
will have to use the potty?

454
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,648
This is where she was.

455
00:43:57,857 --> 00:43:59,025
This is where I...

456
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:00,234
...saw her.

457
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:01,861
That makes sense.

458
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,781
- Where did you finally find one?
- Kmart.

459
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:09,369
I think we're supposed to sit
in a protective circle, aren't we?

460
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:10,578
What's that for?

461
00:44:12,038 --> 00:44:13,915
- Where did you get it?
- Never mind.

462
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:16,084
You stole her shoe.

463
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:19,712
You have to have something
of the dead woman's.

464
00:44:19,921 --> 00:44:20,838
Says who?

465
00:44:21,923 --> 00:44:23,174
Is that blood on it?

466
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:27,553
I don't know. Just place your fingers
on the message indicator.

467
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:29,680
Okay.

468
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:42,443
We wish to commune...

469
00:44:42,652 --> 00:44:44,070
...with the spirit--

470
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:47,490
What?

471
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:49,283
"Wish to commune."

472
00:44:50,118 --> 00:44:51,244
- Forget it.
- What?

473
00:44:51,494 --> 00:44:53,830
No, this whole thing is insane.

474
00:44:54,038 --> 00:44:55,206
I'm sorry.

475
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:57,709
What's her first name?

476
00:45:00,336 --> 00:45:01,587
Mary.

477
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:04,173
Feur.

478
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:08,553
Mary Feur, Mary Feur....

479
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:11,556
Mary Feur....

480
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:15,143
We wish to communicate...

481
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,730
...with the spirit of Mary Feur.

482
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:28,114
- Not much happening.
- Shh.

483
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:01,481
What was that?

484
00:46:03,524 --> 00:46:04,984
It's flickering.

485
00:46:07,028 --> 00:46:08,196
Yeah.

486
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:30,343
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

487
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:06,087
Cooper!

488
00:47:07,755 --> 00:47:08,756
Listen...

489
00:47:09,298 --> 00:47:11,718
...about our little séance.

490
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,803
Norman doesn't need to know.

491
00:47:14,595 --> 00:47:16,931
- I won't tell if you won't.
- It's just that...

492
00:47:17,223 --> 00:47:20,101
...ever since the accident...

493
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:22,228
...he treats me like I'm this...

494
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:25,022
...fragile, loopy....

495
00:47:25,898 --> 00:47:28,651
Well, I am seeing ghosts
in the bathtub, aren't I?

496
00:47:28,901 --> 00:47:32,113
You did wrap your car around a tree
doing, like, 80.

497
00:47:33,322 --> 00:47:34,949
He was pretty shaken up.

498
00:47:35,158 --> 00:47:38,369
- We all were.
- It was an accident. A year ago.

499
00:47:38,578 --> 00:47:40,538
I'm fine.

500
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:42,540
Right?

501
00:47:45,835 --> 00:47:47,837
Of course you are.

502
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:52,717
You're just not much of a medium,
however.

503
00:47:53,593 --> 00:47:55,261
I'll call you tomorrow.

504
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,637
Get some rest.

505
00:47:56,846 --> 00:47:58,639
Did you pick up any dudes yet?

506
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:00,767
I have one in the trunk.

507
00:48:04,145 --> 00:48:05,396
Bye.

508
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,422
What do you want?

509
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,918
She's dead.

510
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:16,838
- Who's dead?
- You know damn well who's dead.

511
00:51:17,046 --> 00:51:18,047
The Feur thing.

512
00:51:18,297 --> 00:51:19,257
Listen to me.

513
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:21,801
He killed her and I'm not crazy.

514
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:25,680
Jody and I had a séance in the
bathroom, and nothing happened...

515
00:51:25,888 --> 00:51:29,392
...but when I went back there
she was there. She was.

516
00:51:30,226 --> 00:51:31,477
Wait a minute.

517
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:34,188
You had a séance?

518
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:39,485
- Are you angry with me?
- What?

519
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,282
- Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
- No.

520
00:51:45,074 --> 00:51:49,245
You know what I've got at stake for
this paper. How important it is to me.

521
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:53,291
I can't help feeling that you're
trying to sabotage me, to hurt me.

522
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:55,376
Norman, this isn't about you.

523
00:51:55,585 --> 00:51:57,503
Something is happening to me.

524
00:51:57,712 --> 00:52:02,508
And it's not to get even, and it's
not some warped bid for attention.

525
00:52:02,717 --> 00:52:07,388
Something is happening in our house,
whether you like it or not.

526
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:11,100
Claire.

527
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:13,561
Claire, stop.

528
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,937
You're overreacting.

529
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:17,023
Don't tell me how to react.

530
00:52:17,231 --> 00:52:19,942
- Will you keep your voice down?
- I will not!

531
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:21,319
Maybe you're right.

532
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:23,404
Maybe I am losing my mind.

533
00:52:23,613 --> 00:52:25,281
But what if I'm not?

534
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,116
What if she died...

535
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:28,534
...some horrible death?

536
00:52:28,743 --> 00:52:30,620
Can we please not do this here?

537
00:52:30,912 --> 00:52:32,538
Oh, wow.

538
00:52:37,877 --> 00:52:39,087
You.

539
00:52:39,379 --> 00:52:41,297
You think you're smart, don't you?

540
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:43,132
You think you got away with it.

541
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:47,220
Well, I know you killed her,
you murdering son of a bitch!

542
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:48,388
Who?

543
00:52:48,596 --> 00:52:50,098
Don't give me that shit.

544
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:52,141
Your wife.

545
00:52:53,017 --> 00:52:55,311
She's very upset. Forgive us, please.

546
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,646
Honey.

547
00:52:58,147 --> 00:53:00,149
I didn't kill my wife.

548
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:03,069
Are you all right?

549
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:07,115
Come on, honey.

550
00:53:09,701 --> 00:53:11,661
Come on. Let's go.

551
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:13,579
I'm sorry.

552
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,881
You all right?

553
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,258
Oh. Yeah.

554
00:53:25,508 --> 00:53:27,009
I'm fine.

555
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:29,637
What happened? Just now?

556
00:53:29,846 --> 00:53:32,974
I just saw Norman's face.

557
00:53:34,934 --> 00:53:38,062
He was so frightened for me.

558
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:39,564
How's your marriage?

559
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,484
Good. Really good.

560
00:53:44,193 --> 00:53:46,946
We've had our moments, I guess...

561
00:53:47,155 --> 00:53:50,324
...but he's a wonderful husband
and father.

562
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:54,162
I mean, sure, he can be obsessed
with his work...

563
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,831
...and sometimes it's like...

564
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:01,335
...that he doesn't see me.

565
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:03,796
Or, you know...

566
00:54:04,005 --> 00:54:05,673
...like I'm....

567
00:54:07,383 --> 00:54:09,927
That there's something wrong...

568
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:12,263
...with me.

569
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,017
That can't feel good.

570
00:54:16,726 --> 00:54:18,227
No.

571
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,944
Okay.

572
00:54:27,195 --> 00:54:30,239
I see where you're going with this...

573
00:54:30,448 --> 00:54:33,409
...but my marriage is fine. No.

574
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:37,997
I have had some kind of
empty-nest episode...

575
00:54:38,206 --> 00:54:40,833
...where I saw...

576
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:44,003
...some things that weren't there.

577
00:54:45,588 --> 00:54:49,092
Let's deal with that.
I'm willing to deal with that.

578
00:55:17,537 --> 00:55:20,915
"Thought you might need this.
Love, Jody."

579
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:23,000
Uh-oh.

580
00:55:40,852 --> 00:55:42,603
Mrs. Spencer.

581
00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:48,234
I wanted to apologize
for scaring you like I did.

582
00:55:48,443 --> 00:55:50,778
When I thought about
how it must have seemed--

583
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:53,698
Please. Let's just....

584
00:55:57,827 --> 00:55:59,328
Claire Spencer.

585
00:55:59,537 --> 00:56:01,247
Mary Feur.

586
00:56:01,456 --> 00:56:04,667
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Very much.

587
00:56:06,044 --> 00:56:07,253
That day at the fence...

588
00:56:07,462 --> 00:56:09,839
...you seemed terrified.

589
00:56:10,465 --> 00:56:12,842
I don't think I imagined that.

590
00:56:13,092 --> 00:56:14,385
No.

591
00:56:15,344 --> 00:56:17,263
What were you so afraid of?

592
00:56:19,348 --> 00:56:23,811
Have you ever felt so completely
consumed by a feeling for someone...

593
00:56:24,062 --> 00:56:26,773
...that you couldn't breathe?

594
00:56:27,774 --> 00:56:30,443
Thought that your time together
was so...

595
00:56:30,651 --> 00:56:34,697
...passionate and consuming that you
felt physical pain when they'd leave?

596
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,158
Um....

597
00:56:37,408 --> 00:56:38,368
Sure.

598
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:40,536
I couldn't catch my breath...

599
00:56:40,995 --> 00:56:42,205
...and I panicked.

600
00:56:42,997 --> 00:56:45,458
I never dreamed anyone would hear me.

601
00:56:47,126 --> 00:56:48,961
I tried to leave him.

602
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:52,465
I went to my mother's in Providence...

603
00:56:52,924 --> 00:56:54,467
...but he brought my things up...

604
00:56:54,717 --> 00:56:56,928
...in the middle of the night...

605
00:56:57,345 --> 00:56:59,055
...during the rainstorm.

606
00:56:59,263 --> 00:57:01,599
He pleaded with me to come home.

607
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,559
You must think I'm pathetic.

608
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,436
No.

609
00:57:06,938 --> 00:57:08,231
I don't.

610
00:57:09,524 --> 00:57:13,903
I'll be quick. I've got to get Sidon
to okay my budget before his trip.

611
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:16,572
What's Templeton's wife's name again?

612
00:57:16,823 --> 00:57:18,866
Lois. Phil and Lois Templeton.

613
00:57:19,117 --> 00:57:22,620
Don't let her corner you,
she'll chew your ear off.

614
00:57:22,912 --> 00:57:24,372
- Evening, Phil.
- Here they are.

615
00:57:24,622 --> 00:57:25,832
How do you do? Hi.

616
00:57:26,082 --> 00:57:29,168
Hi. Nice to see you again, Lois.

617
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:21,888
White wine, please.

618
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,020
How are you holding up?

619
00:58:29,312 --> 00:58:31,856
Just fine. It's a lovely party.

620
00:58:32,732 --> 00:58:35,276
Norman was telling me the house
is finished.

621
00:58:35,526 --> 00:58:37,695
- Almost.
- Wonderful.

622
00:58:38,071 --> 00:58:40,531
It's good to see you doing so well.

623
00:58:40,948 --> 00:58:41,908
Thank you.

624
00:58:42,158 --> 00:58:44,494
Well, I was worried.

625
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:48,873
I don't think I've seen you since
Norman's reception here last year.

626
00:58:49,082 --> 00:58:50,792
You were worried?

627
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:56,214
I swear, I've become that nosy old lady
I used to run away from at Amherst.

628
00:58:56,422 --> 00:58:58,800
No, I'm just not sure what you mean.

629
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:02,678
You got so upset.

630
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:05,431
Oh, at the party.

631
00:59:05,723 --> 00:59:07,809
For the DuPont Chair.

632
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:09,352
You remember?

633
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:12,188
Well, I remember the party, but....

634
00:59:14,565 --> 00:59:16,192
Oh, God!

635
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:20,738
I had completely forgotten.

636
00:59:21,197 --> 00:59:22,573
I broke your crystal.

637
00:59:22,782 --> 00:59:23,991
Oh, my dear.

638
00:59:24,242 --> 00:59:26,994
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.

639
00:59:27,578 --> 00:59:30,790
But you went completely pale.
You couldn't catch your breath.

640
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,960
It was as if you had seen a ghost.

641
01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:20,882
"Missing girl."

642
01:00:24,385 --> 01:00:27,472
Madison Elizabeth.

643
01:00:29,682 --> 01:00:31,225
M-E.

644
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:45,990
Frank.

645
01:00:46,824 --> 01:00:49,118
Madison Elizabeth...

646
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:51,329
...Frank.

647
01:00:53,831 --> 01:00:56,000
M-E-F.

648
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:34,414
Claire?

649
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,502
Hey, good morning.

650
01:01:43,339 --> 01:01:44,340
Up all night?

651
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:45,425
Mm-hm.

652
01:01:45,675 --> 01:01:46,592
You okay?

653
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:55,518
Do you remember this?

654
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:05,236
It's the girl that disappeared
last year.

655
01:02:07,572 --> 01:02:08,823
Did you know her?

656
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:10,366
No.

657
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:20,251
Claire, I'm afraid to ask.

658
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:23,755
Where's all this going?

659
01:02:25,048 --> 01:02:26,049
It's her.

660
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:30,762
The woman I saw in the bathtub.

661
01:02:31,012 --> 01:02:32,472
- The ghost?
- Yes, the ghost.

662
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,557
I thought it was Mrs. Feur,
but it's not.

663
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:36,350
I'm positive this time.

664
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:38,061
Claire, stop it!

665
01:02:38,895 --> 01:02:40,271
Stop it.

666
01:02:43,107 --> 01:02:46,194
I know you're going through something
I don't understand.

667
01:02:48,404 --> 01:02:51,574
I have tried to be here for you,
but this is enough, Claire.

668
01:02:51,824 --> 01:02:53,117
Enough.

669
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:56,829
Do you want to go see somebody
together?

670
01:02:57,163 --> 01:02:58,956
I'll call Dr. Drayton.

671
01:03:01,709 --> 01:03:04,045
Then what, Claire? What?

672
01:03:04,295 --> 01:03:06,339
Tell me what to do.

673
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:08,508
It's her.

674
01:03:11,177 --> 01:03:13,596
So let me ask you this....
Mr. McCain?

675
01:03:13,888 --> 01:03:15,765
- McCann.
- McCann.

676
01:03:17,308 --> 01:03:21,604
Nothing was ever found?
No car, or...?

677
01:03:21,813 --> 01:03:25,149
Listen....
This girl's a real live wire.

678
01:03:25,441 --> 01:03:29,487
She drives around in a souped-up
Mustang convertible.

679
01:03:29,737 --> 01:03:31,197
Most people think she's...

680
01:03:31,447 --> 01:03:35,410
...off around Mexico or somewhere
with her friends.

681
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,955
The police downgraded it to a runaway.

682
01:03:41,082 --> 01:03:44,085
Her mother lives out here
in Addison County.

683
01:03:45,753 --> 01:03:48,256
- Mrs. Frank?
- Yeah?

684
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:51,134
I'm Claire.

685
01:03:52,635 --> 01:03:55,638
I wanted to talk to you about Madison.

686
01:03:56,013 --> 01:03:58,099
Just plain coffee.

687
01:03:58,808 --> 01:04:01,978
- None of that mocha nonsense.
- Fine.

688
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:06,441
You look a little old for a student.

689
01:04:06,691 --> 01:04:10,361
I'm not a student. We met at a party.

690
01:04:11,112 --> 01:04:13,614
Well, that sounds about right.

691
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:17,910
I never understood how a girl
that wild got all A's.

692
01:04:18,161 --> 01:04:20,163
She liked to read a lot, though.

693
01:04:20,413 --> 01:04:24,333
Sometimes she'd lock herself up
in her room for days, just reading.

694
01:04:25,918 --> 01:04:30,423
They wanted to put her in a school
for the gifted when she was young.

695
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:33,509
Maddie wouldn't hear about it.

696
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:37,555
I don't know where she got it.
She didn't get it from me.

697
01:04:38,723 --> 01:04:41,976
She probably got it
from her father's side of the family.

698
01:04:44,771 --> 01:04:46,898
She never really mentioned her father.

699
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:49,859
Yeah, well, she wouldn't.

700
01:04:51,152 --> 01:04:52,862
She was 12 when he left.

701
01:04:53,112 --> 01:04:55,365
Never spoke about him after that.

702
01:04:57,867 --> 01:04:59,494
You don't even need the sound.

703
01:05:01,913 --> 01:05:04,916
You can pretty much tell
what's happening by the faces.

704
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:09,128
I turn it up sometimes, though.

705
01:05:09,879 --> 01:05:12,048
Feels like there's someone here.

706
01:05:15,551 --> 01:05:17,011
Why are you here?

707
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:24,894
I don't know.

708
01:05:26,729 --> 01:05:28,439
You want to see her room?

709
01:05:39,492 --> 01:05:41,119
Full scholarship.

710
01:05:41,786 --> 01:05:43,329
Princeton too.

711
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:46,874
She wanted to stay on the East Coast.

712
01:05:48,084 --> 01:05:50,253
You must be so proud.

713
01:05:54,674 --> 01:05:57,427
These are the last pictures
taken of her.

714
01:05:58,261 --> 01:06:00,263
The police used this one.

715
01:06:01,973 --> 01:06:03,933
Let me get that. Excuse me.

716
01:07:24,597 --> 01:07:25,765
Claire?

717
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:49,664
Claire?

718
01:08:05,847 --> 01:08:09,976
- Hello, Dr. Spencer.
- Mrs. Spencer.

719
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:14,147
Forbidden fruit.

720
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:19,736
You got a problem with that?

721
01:09:12,705 --> 01:09:15,625
Guess this means you're not
mad at me anymore, huh?

722
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,835
I wouldn't go that far.

723
01:10:02,422 --> 01:10:04,048
Ow.

724
01:10:06,426 --> 01:10:08,469
Take it easy, huh?

725
01:10:14,142 --> 01:10:15,852
What's got into you?

726
01:10:20,606 --> 01:10:22,984
- Ow!
- What's the matter?

727
01:10:23,901 --> 01:10:25,153
It's too rough.

728
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:27,113
Since when?

729
01:10:32,744 --> 01:10:34,203
This is a brand-new--

730
01:10:34,412 --> 01:10:35,705
Shh.

731
01:10:47,258 --> 01:10:51,095
- Okay, Claire, that's--
- Why don't you shut up, professor?

732
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,724
Why don't you just...

733
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,393
...shut up?

734
01:12:15,263 --> 01:12:17,932
I think she's starting
to suspect something.

735
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:19,642
Who?

736
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:23,646
Your wife.

737
01:12:25,481 --> 01:12:26,315
Stop it!

738
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:41,039
You know.

739
01:12:41,581 --> 01:12:42,832
What the hell are you doing?

740
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,376
I know.

741
01:12:49,047 --> 01:12:50,590
I was there.

742
01:12:53,593 --> 01:12:55,720
Just before the accident.

743
01:12:57,138 --> 01:12:58,306
I remember now.

744
01:12:59,265 --> 01:13:00,266
What?

745
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,727
I came to the door.

746
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:05,646
There was whispering.

747
01:13:05,855 --> 01:13:08,775
I saw you in the mirror...

748
01:13:11,736 --> 01:13:14,405
...lying there with her...

749
01:13:14,614 --> 01:13:15,823
...in our house.

750
01:13:16,074 --> 01:13:17,950
Claire, listen to me.

751
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,702
She was at the DuPont party...

752
01:13:19,911 --> 01:13:22,330
...staring at me. It was her.

753
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,207
That's why I couldn't breathe.

754
01:13:24,457 --> 01:13:26,709
That's why I dropped the glass.

755
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:29,629
Honey, that was last year.
We were having troubles.

756
01:13:30,254 --> 01:13:32,715
So you slept with a fucking student?

757
01:13:32,965 --> 01:13:35,635
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Don't touch me.

758
01:13:36,469 --> 01:13:37,595
Get away from me.

759
01:13:39,889 --> 01:13:41,349
Get out!

760
01:13:42,517 --> 01:13:44,060
I said, get out!

761
01:13:46,145 --> 01:13:47,063
Fine.

762
01:13:48,731 --> 01:13:50,274
Claire, please, please.

763
01:13:50,733 --> 01:13:52,568
I gave up everything.

764
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:54,612
Claire, please don't....

765
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:58,199
- My life, my music.
- I never asked you to quit.

766
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:00,702
There was never any other choice!

767
01:14:00,952 --> 01:14:04,247
You had to topple perfect daddy.
That meant perfect wife.

768
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:06,624
- Perfect family.
- That's not fair.

769
01:14:06,874 --> 01:14:08,584
You were touring with a baby...

770
01:14:08,835 --> 01:14:10,795
...and you were happy to give it up.

771
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:14,132
When you did, you hated me for it,
so you gave it all to her.

772
01:14:14,382 --> 01:14:15,675
- Who?
- Caitlin!

773
01:14:15,967 --> 01:14:16,926
Leave her out of this.

774
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:20,430
And then some bright
young woman finds me attractive.

775
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,515
- Stop it!
- And I slipped!

776
01:14:22,765 --> 01:14:24,934
- God help me, I slipped!
- I'm not gonna listen.

777
01:14:25,184 --> 01:14:29,772
- Claire, I tried to break it off.
- You should've tried harder.

778
01:14:38,072 --> 01:14:39,949
I was in Adamant.

779
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:42,201
In Adamant?

780
01:14:42,452 --> 01:14:46,497
You know, that artsy little hippie
village a couple hours away down on 7.

781
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:51,294
I stopped at this café to get coffee,
and I see Norman sitting in the back.

782
01:14:51,544 --> 01:14:52,837
But he wasn't alone.

783
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:56,299
It was a young blond woman.

784
01:14:57,091 --> 01:14:58,718
I didn't see her face.

785
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:01,012
I didn't think anything of it
at first.

786
01:15:01,262 --> 01:15:03,723
And I was walking over to say hello.

787
01:15:06,684 --> 01:15:09,979
And they started arguing
in such a way...

788
01:15:11,522 --> 01:15:13,316
...that it stopped me.

789
01:15:14,692 --> 01:15:18,196
Then a few days later,
you were in the accident.

790
01:15:18,446 --> 01:15:21,866
And I get a bizarre call from Stan
working at the hospital...

791
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:24,535
...asking me, was I with you that day?

792
01:15:24,827 --> 01:15:26,537
If you were upset about anything.

793
01:15:26,746 --> 01:15:29,582
He made it sound
like you had deliberately...

794
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:31,292
...driven your car into a tree.

795
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:33,628
And I thought, "Oh, my God.

796
01:15:33,878 --> 01:15:36,714
Claire's found out."

797
01:15:36,964 --> 01:15:41,719
And when I went to the hospital,
I see Norman.

798
01:15:44,931 --> 01:15:48,267
And he was so desperate
at the thought...

799
01:15:51,062 --> 01:15:52,939
...of losing you.

800
01:15:54,482 --> 01:15:57,068
I couldn't say anything.

801
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:01,114
Please...

802
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:06,035
...don't hate me, Claire.

803
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:08,913
I don't hate you.

804
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,211
Hello, this is Miss Jody.

805
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:19,590
Can't get to the phone. Leave your
name and I'll call you back.

806
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:21,676
Jody, it's Norman.

807
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:25,138
I'm looking for Claire.
Will you please...

808
01:16:26,597 --> 01:16:28,474
...ask her to call home, please?

809
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,106
I can't talk to him.

810
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:40,653
Will you call and tell him
I'll be home in the morning?

811
01:16:43,281 --> 01:16:45,408
I have to ask him something.

812
01:17:08,306 --> 01:17:09,599
Norman?

813
01:17:40,546 --> 01:17:41,756
Norman?

814
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,886
Norman!

815
01:17:49,889 --> 01:17:51,265
Oh, God!

816
01:17:52,225 --> 01:17:53,142
Norman!

817
01:17:53,518 --> 01:17:55,687
- How's his blood pressure?
- 140/80.

818
01:17:55,978 --> 01:17:59,399
- How about his rhythm?
- Rhythm is normal. Normal sinus.

819
01:17:59,649 --> 01:18:01,442
- No sign of arrhythmia.
- Good.

820
01:18:01,651 --> 01:18:04,112
Pulse/ox is normal.
His pupils were equal.

821
01:18:04,404 --> 01:18:06,114
I'd still like to take you down.

822
01:18:06,406 --> 01:18:07,782
I'm fine, really.

823
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:11,828
Dr. Powell, I'd recommend
a cardiac workup.

824
01:18:12,286 --> 01:18:16,249
- I'll take care of that.
- He needs to sign the release form.

825
01:18:16,499 --> 01:18:18,126
Thanks, guys.

826
01:18:18,376 --> 01:18:22,088
They can take you for a CAT scan
tomorrow if you start feeling dizzy.

827
01:18:22,338 --> 01:18:24,132
I'm not going to the hospital...

828
01:18:24,382 --> 01:18:26,968
...unless they have
a miracle drug for clumsiness.

829
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,053
Honey, I'm so sorry.

830
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,264
Thank God you came home.

831
01:18:31,556 --> 01:18:33,099
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

832
01:18:33,349 --> 01:18:35,768
You know, if that breaker
hadn't popped, he....

833
01:18:36,019 --> 01:18:37,186
I know.

834
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:39,772
Yeah, don't worry, Claire.

835
01:18:40,023 --> 01:18:43,026
You just keep him quiet tonight, okay?

836
01:18:43,276 --> 01:18:47,071
You might want to think twice
about keeping anything electrical...

837
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:49,699
- ...next to the tub.
- Oh, thank you.

838
01:18:51,325 --> 01:18:53,411
Goodbye. Call me, okay?

839
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:29,238
I called you last night.
I left a message on Jody's machine.

840
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:33,993
I want you to answer one question.

841
01:19:36,913 --> 01:19:40,833
Did you have anything to do
with her disappearance?

842
01:19:42,585 --> 01:19:43,503
Yes.

843
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,093
I had an affair with her.

844
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:55,139
And when I tried to break it off...

845
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,975
...she became unstable.

846
01:20:00,645 --> 01:20:02,939
She came out here to the house.

847
01:20:04,649 --> 01:20:06,734
She threatened to kill herself...

848
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:10,780
...or you.

849
01:20:13,449 --> 01:20:16,786
I didn't think she'd
go through with any of it.

850
01:20:18,287 --> 01:20:19,664
But then she....

851
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:23,209
She disappeared.

852
01:20:27,004 --> 01:20:28,464
It was her, Norman.

853
01:20:28,715 --> 01:20:30,174
She tried to kill you.

854
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,427
- Claire.
- You said it yourself.

855
01:20:32,677 --> 01:20:34,303
She wanted you dead.

856
01:20:34,595 --> 01:20:37,682
Are you saying I was attacked
by a ghost?

857
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:40,768
You had an affair with a girl...

858
01:20:40,977 --> 01:20:45,815
...who threatened to kill herself, and
now there's a presence in our house.

859
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:49,402
A young, blond girl.

860
01:20:50,194 --> 01:20:51,654
Don't you get it?

861
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:53,823
She did it, Norman.

862
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,366
She's dead...

863
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,536
...and now she's trying to hurt you
or both of us.

864
01:20:58,786 --> 01:21:01,372
- You don't know that she's dead.
- Of course we do!

865
01:21:01,664 --> 01:21:04,083
It's the only thing that makes--

866
01:21:06,878 --> 01:21:08,171
Oh, God.

867
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,966
It's my fault. I....

868
01:21:12,592 --> 01:21:14,052
I opened the door.

869
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:17,805
- Madison. I stole her hair.
- From where?

870
01:21:18,056 --> 01:21:20,183
- And it gave her power.
- Claire.

871
01:21:21,267 --> 01:21:24,812
Nothing attacked me.
There are no ghosts.

872
01:21:25,563 --> 01:21:28,107
It was an accident. I'm fine.

873
01:21:28,566 --> 01:21:31,652
It's not your fault.
Are you listening to me?

874
01:21:32,278 --> 01:21:34,489
- Yes.
- Claire, say it.

875
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:37,825
Say it:
"It was an accident.

876
01:21:38,117 --> 01:21:39,660
It's not my fault."

877
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:42,997
Say it, Claire.

878
01:21:43,915 --> 01:21:46,292
I need to go lie down.

879
01:21:46,584 --> 01:21:50,088
I didn't sleep last night,
and I need to lie down.

880
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,051
I want to be alone for a while.

881
01:22:15,655 --> 01:22:18,116
Hey, Teddy, it's me.
Right, yeah.

882
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:22,412
What's the name of that friend of
yours? That who-you-gonna-call guy?

883
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:25,957
The guy that does the paranormal
psych stuff?

884
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,834
Holodnik.

885
01:22:29,502 --> 01:22:32,880
Could you contact him and ask him
to give me a call here?

886
01:22:33,131 --> 01:22:35,967
I'd really like to talk to him today.

887
01:23:47,413 --> 01:23:48,498
Hello.

888
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,833
Yes, this is he.

889
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:52,919
Thanks for calling back.

890
01:23:54,837 --> 01:23:58,591
No, sir. That was my father.

891
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:03,930
Yeah, he passed away
a couple of years ago.

892
01:24:05,348 --> 01:24:07,058
Yes, he was. Thank you.

893
01:24:08,267 --> 01:24:10,812
Look, the reason I'm calling is....

894
01:24:11,062 --> 01:24:13,815
I'm a little out of my depth here.

895
01:24:14,023 --> 01:24:17,193
Someone who is very close to me...

896
01:24:17,443 --> 01:24:20,196
...believes herself to be
or seems to be...

897
01:24:20,446 --> 01:24:22,448
...in contact with some kind of...

898
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,660
...entity or spirit, and--

899
01:24:28,913 --> 01:24:31,374
No, there's no...

900
01:24:31,624 --> 01:24:34,001
...no history of delusional behavior.

901
01:24:37,171 --> 01:24:41,718
Well, I guess what I'm asking is,
is it possible that she could be...

902
01:24:41,926 --> 01:24:45,012
...causing these manifestations...

903
01:24:45,263 --> 01:24:50,184
...through some kind of unconscious
or telekinetic--?

904
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:53,855
Uh-huh.

905
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,067
Is there anything else
that it could be?

906
01:25:04,741 --> 01:25:07,118
And this has been documented?

907
01:25:10,455 --> 01:25:11,497
Really?

908
01:25:14,417 --> 01:25:16,878
I'm sorry,
but could I call you back...

909
01:25:17,128 --> 01:25:19,005
...or have you call me back?

910
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,090
Please, yes, that'll be great.

911
01:25:21,632 --> 01:25:22,759
Thank you, sir.

912
01:25:26,846 --> 01:25:27,764
Claire!

913
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,107
Claire!

914
01:26:03,966 --> 01:26:05,176
Claire!

915
01:26:31,202 --> 01:26:32,495
You all right, Claire?

916
01:26:32,745 --> 01:26:33,830
The braid!

917
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,042
Where's the braid?

918
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:40,002
What are you talking about?

919
01:26:41,504 --> 01:26:43,506
What are you talking about?
This?

920
01:26:43,756 --> 01:26:45,758
Is this what you're talking about?

921
01:26:46,008 --> 01:26:50,054
- Where'd you get this?
- I took it from Madison's house.

922
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:53,516
This is hers?

923
01:26:54,058 --> 01:26:56,102
This is Madison Frank's hair?

924
01:27:17,415 --> 01:27:18,791
What do you think?

925
01:27:20,084 --> 01:27:22,295
I really don't know.

926
01:27:26,549 --> 01:27:27,800
Norman.

927
01:27:33,264 --> 01:27:34,390
Yes...

928
01:27:36,309 --> 01:27:37,852
...I believe you.

929
01:28:28,361 --> 01:28:29,612
You're playing.

930
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:33,783
She's gone.

931
01:28:35,827 --> 01:28:36,953
How do you know?

932
01:28:38,371 --> 01:28:39,997
I can feel it.

933
01:28:48,506 --> 01:28:51,342
I picked up the book you ordered
at the bookstore.

934
01:29:00,309 --> 01:29:03,980
Claire, I don't know how to apologize
to you for what I've done.

935
01:29:11,029 --> 01:29:13,197
But if you give me another chance...

936
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:19,579
...I promise I'll spend the rest of my
life making you glad that you did.

937
01:29:33,217 --> 01:29:34,469
Please.

938
01:29:53,237 --> 01:29:54,697
Last sail of the year.

939
01:29:54,947 --> 01:29:56,574
Beautiful, isn't it?

940
01:29:57,116 --> 01:30:00,370
We ought to take a drive
before the leaves all disappear.

941
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:04,499
- Stay at a little bed-and-breakfast.
- Look for antiques.

942
01:30:04,749 --> 01:30:06,959
Yeah, we haven't
done that for a while.

943
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:10,004
Adamant.

944
01:30:11,255 --> 01:30:14,842
- Adamant?
- An artsy little village down 7.

945
01:30:15,093 --> 01:30:17,136
Supposed to be charming.

946
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:20,223
- Do you know it?
- No.

947
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,769
Maybe we'll stop there for lunch.

948
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:45,998
What's that for?

949
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,167
Nothing.

950
01:33:37,795 --> 01:33:39,505
God, oh, God....

951
01:34:16,501 --> 01:34:18,753
You don't understand what that is.

952
01:34:20,463 --> 01:34:21,756
Don't I, Norman?

953
01:34:22,006 --> 01:34:25,009
That's Madison's necklace.

954
01:34:28,513 --> 01:34:30,223
You killed her, didn't you?

955
01:34:31,557 --> 01:34:33,101
I did not.

956
01:34:34,477 --> 01:34:36,020
I didn't kill anyone.

957
01:34:38,356 --> 01:34:40,066
Jesus, Claire.

958
01:34:40,316 --> 01:34:41,442
Listen to me.

959
01:34:42,985 --> 01:34:44,612
When I got here...

960
01:34:45,113 --> 01:34:48,991
...she was already dead. She killed
herself in our house to destroy me.

961
01:34:49,867 --> 01:34:51,411
Do you think I'm stupid?

962
01:34:51,869 --> 01:34:55,123
She left that for you in the garden,
with a letter.

963
01:34:55,373 --> 01:34:57,959
I burned the letter
and threw the box in the lake.

964
01:34:59,502 --> 01:35:00,461
A week before...

965
01:35:01,421 --> 01:35:04,674
...she showed up at the DuPont party.

966
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:08,761
I was terrified.

967
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:12,724
She insisted, so I agreed
to meet her here.

968
01:35:13,683 --> 01:35:14,851
When I got here...

969
01:35:15,101 --> 01:35:16,936
...she had taken pills.

970
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:20,440
I tried to revive her, but...

971
01:35:21,274 --> 01:35:23,067
...she was gone.

972
01:35:23,735 --> 01:35:25,987
There was nothing I could do.

973
01:35:27,613 --> 01:35:30,700
So I put her in her car...

974
01:35:31,075 --> 01:35:33,161
...and I drove to the boat ramp...

975
01:35:33,453 --> 01:35:36,706
...and I rolled it out into the lake.

976
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:40,293
I made a terrible mistake.
I know that.

977
01:35:40,877 --> 01:35:42,336
But tell me, Claire.

978
01:35:42,587 --> 01:35:45,590
What should I have done?
Should I sacrifice everything?

979
01:35:45,798 --> 01:35:47,425
Our marriage?

980
01:35:48,384 --> 01:35:51,637
My work,
which I spent my whole life on?

981
01:35:54,057 --> 01:35:55,767
Tell me, Claire.

982
01:35:56,934 --> 01:36:00,104
Tell me, please. Because we can
put this behind us.

983
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:02,482
Our life can go on.

984
01:36:02,732 --> 01:36:04,275
It's not too late.

985
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:10,073
What are you asking me to do?

986
01:36:12,241 --> 01:36:14,911
I'm asking you to forgive me.

987
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:31,260
That girl must be brought up.

988
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:05,044
Hello. This is Dr. Norman Spencer.

989
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:07,130
I have some information...

990
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,257
...about a missing person.

991
01:37:09,716 --> 01:37:11,968
Madison Frank, yes.

992
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:16,514
Could you send an officer
out to the house, please?

993
01:37:19,183 --> 01:37:21,144
15 Willoughby Lane.

994
01:37:21,352 --> 01:37:23,479
It's about a mile from the bridge.

995
01:37:25,023 --> 01:37:26,149
Okay.

996
01:37:27,191 --> 01:37:28,484
Thank you.

997
01:37:42,874 --> 01:37:44,834
I'm gonna go get dressed.

998
01:39:51,294 --> 01:39:53,546
Information. What city?

999
01:40:01,179 --> 01:40:02,430
Don't!

1000
01:40:05,016 --> 01:40:05,933
Stop it!

1001
01:41:08,246 --> 01:41:10,415
I begged you, Claire.

1002
01:41:11,749 --> 01:41:13,918
I pleaded with you.

1003
01:41:19,173 --> 01:41:21,134
But you wouldn't let it go.

1004
01:41:25,054 --> 01:41:26,514
Oh, Claire.

1005
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:31,728
I never wanted any of this to happen.

1006
01:41:33,813 --> 01:41:34,856
All I ever wanted...

1007
01:41:36,733 --> 01:41:38,693
...was for you to love me.

1008
01:41:40,486 --> 01:41:42,030
Be proud of me.

1009
01:41:43,823 --> 01:41:45,283
To be happy.

1010
01:41:48,244 --> 01:41:50,246
She was going to go to the dean.

1011
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:52,665
She would have ruined us.

1012
01:41:54,292 --> 01:41:56,961
Did she think I was just
gonna sit there...

1013
01:41:57,211 --> 01:41:59,255
...and watch it happen?

1014
01:42:03,968 --> 01:42:06,346
You have no idea what it was like.

1015
01:42:06,721 --> 01:42:08,681
Hold her underwater...

1016
01:42:11,684 --> 01:42:14,020
...watch her life slip away.

1017
01:42:21,194 --> 01:42:23,237
But she gave me no choice.

1018
01:42:33,915 --> 01:42:35,375
And neither have you.

1019
01:42:41,547 --> 01:42:44,801
I can't figure out
how you put it all together.

1020
01:42:45,593 --> 01:42:47,595
At first I thought you knew.

1021
01:42:47,887 --> 01:42:52,266
Thought you created the whole
ghost thing as an elaborate trap.

1022
01:42:53,309 --> 01:42:55,561
Then I realized you believed it.

1023
01:42:56,145 --> 01:42:59,399
It was a passive-aggressive
masterpiece.

1024
01:43:03,736 --> 01:43:05,613
The first time I met you...

1025
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:10,076
...all I ever wanted was to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1026
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:14,455
It's not gonna happen now.

1027
01:43:49,407 --> 01:43:50,366
Too cold.

1028
01:43:52,493 --> 01:43:55,246
I almost froze to death laying here...

1029
01:43:55,496 --> 01:43:59,083
...wet, naked, pretending to be
electrocuted.

1030
01:43:59,959 --> 01:44:01,419
Hey, Coop.

1031
01:44:01,753 --> 01:44:04,213
How you doing? How you doing, boy?

1032
01:44:04,464 --> 01:44:08,092
Let's go get your ball. Come on.
Come on.

1033
01:44:26,152 --> 01:44:27,528
Jody, it's Norman.

1034
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:29,822
If you're there, pick up, please.

1035
01:44:30,114 --> 01:44:32,241
It's Norman.

1036
01:44:33,785 --> 01:44:35,244
Listen, Claire and I...

1037
01:44:36,788 --> 01:44:38,331
...had a terrible blowout.

1038
01:44:38,623 --> 01:44:39,999
Could you do me a favor?

1039
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:43,544
I'm sleeping at the lab. Could
you check on her in the morning?

1040
01:44:44,212 --> 01:44:45,755
I'm worried about her.

1041
01:44:47,632 --> 01:44:49,092
Thanks.

1042
01:45:13,157 --> 01:45:15,493
The halothane's starting to wear off.

1043
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:23,126
I'm sure in some...

1044
01:45:24,043 --> 01:45:27,046
...tragic way,
your suicide is gonna...

1045
01:45:27,797 --> 01:45:30,883
...help bring Caitlin and I
closer together.

1046
01:45:33,928 --> 01:45:35,888
And every time I look at her...

1047
01:45:37,598 --> 01:45:38,766
...I'll see you.

1048
01:45:45,273 --> 01:45:46,899
Oh, God.

1049
01:46:11,591 --> 01:46:12,550
What's this?

1050
01:57:44,367 --> 01:57:45,660
Oh, shit.

1051
01:58:00,967 --> 01:58:03,011
I'm on the bridge!

1052
01:58:03,594 --> 01:58:04,971
Somebody help me!

1053
01:58:06,806 --> 01:58:07,932
I'm on the bridge!

1054
01:58:46,387 --> 01:58:47,930
No!

1055
01:59:38,731 --> 01:59:40,775
I beg you...

1056
01:59:41,025 --> 01:59:42,318
...think of Caitlin.

1057
01:59:42,568 --> 01:59:44,570
Please, don't. Please.
