1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,779
<i>Previously on Hannibal...</i>

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:06,799
- How do you know Hannibal is in Florence?
- Botticelli.

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,552
You're drawing them to you, aren't you?

4
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:13,556
I'm not searching for Hannibal.
I know exactly where he is.

5
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:18,891
I will pay 3 million
dollars for the doctor alive.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,730
I'm inspector Rinaldo Pazzi.

7
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,315
Dr. Lecter is careful. He will strike.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,319
You're going to be caught.
It's already been set into motion.

9
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,813
Jack.

10
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,013
He's wounded...

11
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,895
and he's worried.

12
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:46,465
No, Hannibal doesn't worry.

13
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,068
Knowing he's in danger
won't rattle him any more

14
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,137
than killing does.

15
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,405
If Rinaldo Pazzi had decided to do his job

16
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,374
as an officer of the law,

17
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,343
he would have determined
very quickly that he was

18
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,311
Hannibal Lecter. Would have
taken less than 30 minutes

19
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,247
- to get a warrant.
- All those resources

20
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:04,750
were denied to Pazzi.

21
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,186
As soon as he decided to sell Hannibal,

22
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,188
he became a bounty hunter.

23
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,324
Outside the law and alone.

24
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:16,462
Here we are: outside the law and alone.

25
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,751
Have you told <i>la polizia</i>

26
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:26,322
they're looking for Hannibal Lecter?

27
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:30,159
They're motivated to find
Dr. Fell inside the law.

28
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,962
Knowing who he is, what he's worth,

29
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,964
it will just coax them out of bounds.

30
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,067
- That'd be a free-for-all.
- And Hannibal will slip away.

31
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,271
Will you slip away with him?

32
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:48,043
Part of me will always want to.

33
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:51,413
You have to cut that part out.

34
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:53,682
(small chuckle)

35
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,652
No, of course, you found him here,

36
00:03:56,654 --> 00:04:00,356
not because of the exhibit,

37
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:03,659
but because of the crowd it attracts.

38
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,365
You had him, Jack. He was beaten.

39
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,800
Why didn't you kill him?

40
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:16,639
(Jack sighs.)

41
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:21,010
Maybe I need you to.

42
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:35,157
I want to be able to draw
these streets from memory.

43
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,660
I want to be able to draw
the Palazzo Vecchio

44
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:39,628
and the Duomo.

45
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,565
You won't be coming back here
for a very long time.

46
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:48,337
Memories of Florence will be all I have.

47
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:52,741
Florence is where I became a man.

48
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,115
I see my end in my beginning.

49
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,553
All of our endings can be
found in our beginnings.

50
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,523
History repeats itself,

51
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,591
and there is no escape.

52
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:17,132
You've packed lightly.

53
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,253
I packed for you.

54
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,506
This is where I leave you.

55
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:27,042
Or more accurately,

56
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,078
where you leave me.

57
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:35,651
This isn't how I intended to say goodbye.

58
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:37,620
I imagined it differently.

59
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:41,657
I didn't.

60
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:47,229
I knew that you intended to eat me,

61
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:49,932
and I knew that you had

62
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,468
no intention of eating me hastily.

63
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:58,273
Would be a shame not to savour you.

64
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:02,544
I have not marinated
long enough for your tastes.

65
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,782
When they come for you...

66
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,784
And they will come...

67
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:12,021
what will you say of me?

68
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:17,559
I will help you tell the version
of events you want to be told.

69
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:22,331
I will help you because you asked me to.

70
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:27,002
You may make a meal of me yet, Hannibal...

71
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,587
but not today.

72
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:54,496

(chopping sounds)

75
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,059
Pig tails cut into sections to give

76
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:33,361
the aesthetic of fingers cut at the joint.

77
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:35,563
Finger food. Ha!

78
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:37,765
Hands are how we touch the world.

79
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:40,702
They're tactile... sensual.

80
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:42,170
Remove an arm and your patient

81
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:44,606
will still feel phantom digits.

82
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:48,309
Imagine how Dr. Lecter will feel

83
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:51,879
when he watches you nibble on his fingers.

84
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,104
Oh, poetry, Cordell. Poetry.

85
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:57,619
In a ginger-black vinegar sauce.

86
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,523
Mmmm. It's mostly skin and bone.

87
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,026
- Oh!
- The actual fingers

88
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:08,696
will have more meat.
Then, there's the marrow.

89
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,799
Here it is in a fermented

90
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:14,669
bean sauce.

91
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:17,639
Ah, I prefer the ginger.

92
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,409
No, no.

93
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:22,844
Spit.

94
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,746
- (spitting)
- (Ding!)

95
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,448
- (Cordell laughing)
- A Buddhist singing bowl.

96
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,819
The gong represents the start of a new day.

97
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:35,589
- Buddhists don't eat meat.
- This isn't meat...

98
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:38,325
this is man.

99
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,631
Papa always used to say
meat was a people business.

100
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,900
He was a pioneer in livestock production;

101
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:48,435
I'm sure he's eaten someone.

102
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:50,905
I must admit a tremble
at the notion myself.

103
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:53,607
I find there's something reassuring

104
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,809
about you eating Dr. Lecter.

105
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,912
It makes you the apex predator.

106
00:08:57,914 --> 00:09:00,848
I like that. "Apex predator."

107
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:05,719
We could... Peking duck him.

108
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,454
Oh?

109
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:10,724
You have to torture a duck to prepare it.

110
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:12,960
Pump its skin up with air,

111
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:15,723
then glaze it with a hot honey

112
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,290
and hang it by its neck until it dries.

113
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,593
And then roast until crispy.

114
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,696

115
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,766

116
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:47,369
Transubstantiation.

117
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:50,472
(phone ringing)

118
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,317
I'm here. Tell me.

119
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:05,187
(woman on TV speaking Italian)

120
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:20,769
I feel like I just paid a lot
of money for a dead dago.

121
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:23,772
The feces will fly about Pazzi.

122
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:26,141
Better get it out that Pazzi was dirty.

123
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:29,244
They'll take it better
if he was dirty. Was he dirty?

124
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:32,114
Except for this, I don't know.

125
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,218
What if they trace Pazzi

126
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,487
back to you?

127
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,389
(disfigured man): Oh, I can
take care of that.

128
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,357
You took care of Pazzi.

129
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:44,993
I have little interest

130
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,995
in the expensive piece of meat

131
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:50,032
twitching on the end of that
electrical cord, Dr. Bloom.

132
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:51,819
Might wanna get interested.

133
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:55,003
Hannibal could disappear too well
and you'd be left with nothing.

134
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,005
(seated woman): Better buy another cop.

135
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,877
Better buy the whole department.

136
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,273
(tapping her arm)

137
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,016
You must be looking for Hannibal Lecter.

138
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,554
One of his patients?

139
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:49,591
No, not a patient.

140
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:53,261
Where is he?

141
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:54,969
Seeing how you let yourself in,

142
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,592
forgive me if it's forward for me to ask,

143
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,728
who the hell are you?

144
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,064
Family.

145
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:09,146
And you've come all the way from home.

146
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:12,490
Who are you?

147
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:15,662
I'm his psychiatrist.

148
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:23,069
Medicinal purposes.

149
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:26,639
You're like his bird.

150
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:29,542
I'm his bird, too.

151
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:31,744
He puts us in cages

152
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:34,247
- to see what we'll do.
- Fly away

153
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:38,184
or dash ourselves dead against the bars.

154
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:40,153
You haven't flown away.

155
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:44,290
You are flying right
towards him. How does he

156
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:47,427
inspire such devotion?

157
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:49,462
You're his psychiatrist.

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,267
You could add into what I've learned

159
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:56,536
from my experience with him

160
00:12:56,538 --> 00:13:00,306
and from the mute postures of the dead.

161
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:03,743
Were you there?

162
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:06,145
Did you watch

163
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:08,348
as the wild beast within him

164
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,350
turned from the teat

165
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,952
and entered the world?

166
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,190
I met the beast...

167
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:19,158
and I saw him grow.

168
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:21,861
Someone wants to kill him.

169
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:27,166
More than one someone, I'd say.

170
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,869
What do you want?

171
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:34,340
I want to cage him.

172
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:40,385
I thought Will Graham was
Hannibal's biggest mistake...

173
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,557
wonder if it isn't you.

174
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,861
Now, if you'll excuse me,

175
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:53,565
I have to take my medicine.

176
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,399
Mrs. Fell I presume?

177
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,586
My husband is a doctor.

178
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,213
He's been treating my condition.

179
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,800
And what condition is that... Mrs. Fell?

180
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,344
I get confused.

181
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,478
Oh, please. You need to get

182
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,515
over yourself, whatever self
that is, Bedelia.

183
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:37,519
My name is Lydia Fell.

184
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:41,356
You expect us to believe that you somehow

185
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,126
lost yourself in

186
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:47,763
the hot darkness of Hannibal Lecter's mind?

187
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:51,467
That Lydia Fell is some construct?

188
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,428
It's you, isn't it?

189
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,431
Well, now I'm really confused.

190
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,103
I... don't...

191
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:13,138
believe you.

192
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,446
You...

193
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,381
are not confused...

194
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,583
Bedelia.

195
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:27,229
- That is not my name.
- Oh, you know

196
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:29,805
who you are and what you've
done, and you know exactly

197
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:31,774
how you're going to wiggle
out of it. What is this?

198
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:34,210
Sedatives? Hypnotics?

199
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:35,978
Ethanol? Scopolamine?

200
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,813
- Midazolam?
- Same cocktail

201
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:40,015
Dr. Lecter served Miriam Lass.

202
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:42,351
You've been freebasing your alibi.

203
00:16:42,353 --> 00:16:44,887
And I'm not even mad at you.

204
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:48,023
To tell the truth, I'm fairly impressed.

205
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,626
Mostly because you're still alive.

206
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:53,740
When this fog of yours clears...

207
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:59,854
- I'd love to hear how you managed that.
- You say my husband

208
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,521
murdered a chief investigator.

209
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,790
Where is the<i> polizia?</i>

210
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,236
Shouldn't they be questioning?

211
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,408
Don't worry. They will.

212
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:18,320
They sure are taking their time.

213
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:23,224
What could possibly be the delay?

214
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:25,927
Oh, I have an idea.

215
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,898
Do you?

216
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,133
They're being bought

217
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,570
by the same people
that bought Rinaldo Pazzi.

218
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:37,605
Interest in my husband is

219
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:41,543
certainly getting competitive.

220
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,848
Will?

221
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,085
Will?

222
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,155
I wonder who'll catch him first.

223
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:00,076
I've made new friends in Italy.

224
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:03,791
They're cleaning up and
starting over, so all you need

225
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,669
to concern yourself with now
is what will happen

226
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,012
once Dr. Lecter is in your hands.

227
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,748
You've worked so hard
to give me what I want.

228
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,218
It's only fair to talk
about what Margot wants.

229
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,254
Come sit on Santa's lap, huh?

230
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:26,363
You know what I want.

231
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:29,332
The biggest regret of my life

232
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,368
is taking away your ability

233
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,436
- to create it.
- Adoption

234
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:36,540
is a nice thing to do.
No pedigree in buying

235
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,942
a Chinese baby.
They're cheaper than shoats.

236
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:41,611
I wish I could give you a Verger baby,

237
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:44,614
our own baby. Yours and mine.

238
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:47,450
We could raise it together.

239
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:50,086
The last time you said
you wanted to have a baby,

240
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,889
- you removed my uterus.
- In my defense,

241
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:55,025
you weaponized your uterus.
You shouldn't have been

242
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:56,993
waving it around like a loaded pistol.

243
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:59,262
I brought it on myself.

244
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,999
As you so often do, Margot.

245
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,402
But there's a possibility
that I'm still packing

246
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:09,206
loads of viable sperm.

247
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:13,643
Stumbled across
any viable uteruses lately, hm?

248
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:15,946
What are you up to, Mason?

249
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:18,748
I want us to have a baby, Margot.

250
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,952
I could be really good to a child.

251
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,288
I could take parenting classes.

252
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,458
Let's find a way, Margot.

253
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,029
Let's find a way to be a family again, hmm?

254
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,266
(Will groans.)

255
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:22,174
(Will sighs.)

256
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:24,576
If I saw you every day,

257
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:26,612
forever, Will,

258
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:29,748
I would remember this time.

259
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:34,019
Strange seeing you here in front of me.

260
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:39,124
Been staring at afterimages
of you in places you haven't

261
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:41,126
been in years.

262
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:48,748
"To market, to market, to buy a fat pig.

263
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,350
Home again, home again, jiggity-jig."

264
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:56,989
I wanted to understand you

265
00:20:56,991 --> 00:20:59,992
before I laid eyes on you again.

266
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:04,640
I needed it to be clear...

267
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,811
what I was seeing.

268
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:14,832
Where does the difference between the past

269
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,568
and the future come from?

270
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,071
Mine?

271
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:25,209
Before you and after you.

272
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:29,080
Yours?

273
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:34,051
It's all starting to blur.

274
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:37,521
Mischa.

275
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,460
Abigail.

276
00:21:42,462 --> 00:21:44,829
Chiyoh.

277
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,799
How is Chiyoh?

278
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:53,337
She pushed me off a train.

279
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,773
Atta girl.

280
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:02,139
You and I

281
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:05,117
have begun to blur.

282
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:12,756
(Will sighs.)

283
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:14,925
Isn't that how you found me?

284
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:20,152
Every crime of yours...

285
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:23,122
feels like one I am guilty of.

286
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:30,963
Not just Abigail's murder, every murder...

287
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:34,967
stretching backward and forward in time.

288
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:39,838
Freeing yourself from me and...

289
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,175
me freeing myself from you,

290
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:45,611
they are the same.

291
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:48,247
We're conjoined.

292
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:54,119
I'm curious

293
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,889
whether either of us can

294
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:59,725
survive separation.

295
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:07,533
Now is the hardest test:

296
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:10,702
not letting rage and frustration...

297
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,275
nor forgiveness keep you from thinking.

298
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:33,725
Shall we?

299
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:36,228
(Will groans.)

300
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,700
After you.

301
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:39,528
(gunshot with silencer)

302
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:49,777
Mason's ahead of the FBI

303
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,885
in the pursuit of Hannibal Lecter.

304
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:55,489
Mason has no intention of ever
sharing his lead with the FBI.

305
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:00,294
I do...

306
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,951
once he has Hannibal.

307
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:12,148
There is something I need to get from Mason

308
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,183
before he goes to prison.

309
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:18,721
Any experience harvesting sperm?

310
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:24,961
(with Italian accent):
We cannot locate Dr. Fell.

311
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:32,902
Close attention has been
brought to bear on him.

312
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:35,304
We have eyewitness accounts
of a bloody figure,

313
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:37,273
matching his description,

314
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:39,942
running from the scene.

315
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:42,245
The Italian public has already decided

316
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:44,781
il Mostro has killed Rinaldo Pazzi.

317
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:47,483
A 20-year-old debt finally paid.

318
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:49,852
The Italian public is right.

319
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:52,889
Il Mostro died in prison.

320
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:55,825
<i>Il Commandator Pazzi</i>

321
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:57,827
had been assigned to investigate

322
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:59,996
the disappearance of two men
from the Palazzo Capponi.

323
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:02,999
My husband knew Professor Sogliato.

324
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:07,070
We were at his home many times.

325
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:10,339
We believe your husband was
responsible for the disappearances

326
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:15,011
and murdered Pazzi when he came
to the same conclusion.

327
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:17,513
If you haven't already,

328
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:19,849
access the ViCAP database at Quantico.

329
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:22,385
You'll find Dr. Fell
on the Most-Wanted page,

330
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:24,754
under the name of Hannibal Lecter.

331
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:26,956
The fingerprints
you'll pull from Pazzi's noose

332
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,025
- will be his.
- If you knew

333
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:31,060
Dr. Fell to be Hannibal Lecter,

334
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:33,696
why didn't you bring it to
the attention of the<i> Questura?</i>

335
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:37,300
He had a price on his head. Pazzi
knew about it, tried to sell him.

336
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:40,169
For that kind of money, I can't blame him.

337
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:42,605
Can you?

338
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:45,274
(amused exclamation)

339
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:47,510
You've already been questioned

340
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:50,481
regarding Rinaldo Pazzi's
murder, Signor Crawford.

341
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:54,808
Since you're not in Florence
on official FBI business,

342
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,669
that will be all.

343
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:01,674
Not you, Signora Fell.

344
00:29:01,676 --> 00:29:04,477
You stay right where you are.

345
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:11,484
(sigh)

346
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:25,631
(Will panting)

347
00:29:30,672 --> 00:29:32,638
This is gonna hurt.

348
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
The bullet is still inside you.

349
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:37,009
(Will panting)

350
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:40,046
(Will grunting in pain and panting)

351
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:52,091
Chiyoh has always been
very protective of me.

352
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:54,060
(Will laughing)

353
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:56,395
Did she kill her tenant,

354
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,664
or did you?

355
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,833
She did.

356
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:03,135
Excellent.

357
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
You dropped your forgiveness, Will.

358
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:17,983
You forgive how God forgives.

359
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,255
Would you have done it quickly?

360
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:25,624
Or would you have stopped to gloat?

361
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:28,394
Does God gloat?

362
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:32,031
Often.

363
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:36,836
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

364
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:38,671
Ugh!

365
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:41,507
(Will panting)

366
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,844
(Will breathing easier)

367
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:06,632
Give that a moment.

368
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:37,004
I can almost taste the butter.

369
00:31:37,506 --> 00:31:40,140
Taste and smell are the oldest senses

370
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:43,977
and the closest to the center of the mind.

371
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:47,748
(Will): Parts that precede
pity and morality.

372
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,187
They play in the dome of our skulls,

373
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:54,691
like miracles illuminated
on a church ceiling.

374
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:58,795
The ceremonies and sights
and exchanges of dinner

375
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:02,566
can be far more engaging than theater.

376
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:12,642
What's for dinner?

377
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:14,644
Never ask.

378
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:18,382
Spoils the surprise.

379
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,643
No, no.

380
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:10,448
I don't indulge much in regret, but...

381
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,882
I am sorry to be leaving Italy.

382
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:19,456
There were things in the Palazzo Capponi

383
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,725
I would have liked to read.

384
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:27,664
I would have liked to play the clavier...

385
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,467
and perhaps compose.

386
00:33:39,745 --> 00:33:43,680
I would have liked
to show you Florence, Will.

387
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:47,111
Soup isn't very good.

388
00:33:51,456 --> 00:33:53,757
It's a parsley and thyme infusion,

389
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,860
and more for my sake than yours.

390
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:03,400
Have another sip.

391
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,471
Let that circulate.

392
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:15,245
Are we expecting company?

393
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:52,835
Wrong floor.

394
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:06,215
(muffled Italian song playing)

395
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:12,455
- (tick-tock)
- (something sizzling)

396
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:14,958
(Italian song playing)

397
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:31,140
- (louder sizzling)
- (Italian song still playing)

398
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:50,159
Will.

399
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:54,063
He is under the table, Jack.

400
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,368
Argh!

401
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:11,523
Your husband left you behind.

402
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:16,995
I had no reason to run.

403
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:21,232
I've done nothing wrong.

404
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:23,201
I hold in my hands

405
00:37:23,203 --> 00:37:25,203
the photographs

406
00:37:25,205 --> 00:37:28,506
taken for Dr. Fell's State work permit.

407
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:31,743
Oh. I also have his French

408
00:37:31,745 --> 00:37:34,012
work papers.

409
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:37,949
Looks different with a beard, no?

410
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,388
- That is not my husband.
- This is Roman Fell.

411
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:49,327
And this is Lydia Fell.

412
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:52,731
I am Lydia Fell.

413
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,939
Did you murder her with your husband?

414
00:38:00,941 --> 00:38:03,775
Or did you just watch?

415
00:38:03,777 --> 00:38:07,846
I... am Lydia Fell.

416
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:15,186
I don't care who you are.

417
00:38:15,188 --> 00:38:17,956
I don't care if you're in your right mind

418
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:21,159
or your wrong mind. Understand?

419
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:24,529
Those things are inconsequential.

420
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:31,836
I understand. In this moment,

421
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:34,839
you do not work for the <i>Questura.</i>

422
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:37,675
Hmm...

423
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:41,079
That's a good thing to understand.

424
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:45,583
I do not want to be seen
as... uncooperative.

425
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:50,889
How you're seen is entirely up to you.

426
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:57,095
Rescued by the brave<i> Questura</i> or...

427
00:38:57,097 --> 00:38:59,130
apprehended.

428
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:04,936
I've never considered myself
in need of being...

429
00:39:04,938 --> 00:39:09,558
rescued, until now.

430
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:14,320
Is your husband still in the city?

431
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:19,925
My husband was hoping to meet a friend

432
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:22,729
before he left Florence.

433
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:24,230
Where?

434
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:27,783
The nature of the meeting required privacy.

435
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:31,220
They will be somewhere

436
00:39:31,222 --> 00:39:34,056
no one is supposed to be.

437
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,637
I've taken the liberty of giving you

438
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,906
something to help you relax.

439
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:53,242
Won't be able to do much more than chew,

440
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:55,277
but that's all you'll need to do.

441
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:57,613
I didn't have

442
00:39:57,615 --> 00:40:00,515
an opportunity to ask you
during our last encounter,

443
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:02,618
but did you enjoy the exhibition?

444
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,420
A different kind of evil minds museum...

445
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,358
Not that different.

446
00:40:11,295 --> 00:40:14,563
We were supposed to sit down together

447
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:17,432
at your house in Baltimore,

448
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:20,335
just the three of us.

449
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,337
You were to be the guest of honour.

450
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:27,743
But the menu was all wrong.

451
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:29,845
Yes, it was.

452
00:40:36,987 --> 00:40:40,656
Jack was the first to suggest
getting inside your head.

453
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:46,161
Now, we both have the opportunity

454
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:48,196
to chew quite literally...

455
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,235
what we've only chewed figuratively.

456
00:40:55,306 --> 00:40:58,340
(saw buzzing)

457
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:00,409
Hannibal...

458
00:41:03,314 --> 00:41:04,579
stop.

459
00:41:07,017 --> 00:41:08,817
Stop!

460
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:16,925
(silent screaming)

461
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:23,258
Gentlemen,

462
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,595
welcome to Muskrat Farm.
