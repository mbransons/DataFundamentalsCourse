1
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,573
This is my bath water.

2
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,552
There it is,
going down the drain.

3
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,383
My soap.

4
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,788
My passport,
with no occupation on it...

5
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,587
but I'm a film editor.

6
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,594
That's my Nagra 3.

7
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,189
Actually, it's not mine.
I'm borrowing it from work.

8
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,429
I'm borrowing this film, too,
because I'm shooting everything.

9
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,301
This is the little fern
that Marlene and I bought...

10
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,839
when we first moved in together.

11
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,603
Wow, it's grown.
It's just been a few months.

12
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,168
I bought these shoes for her.

13
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,044
They do not fit her
and she still wears them.

14
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,579
This is my strong French coffee.

15
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,487
And this is... really stupid.

16
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,787
Or is it? I don't know.
Start again.

17
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,488
Paris, September 1st, 1969.

18
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,291
Time is 9:30.

19
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,060
These are pieces of me.

20
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,931
Me in pieces.

21
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,267
I'm trying to find
what's real, what's honest.

22
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,307
The total opposite of the film
I'm editing...

23
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,740
which is a sci-fi picture
about a secret agent...

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,471
Codename: Dragonfly.

25
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,980
Bonjour.

26
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,639
Wake up. Wake up.

27
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,412
Rise and shine, Dragonfly.

28
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,716
It is time for you to wake up.

29
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,120
It is a beautiful day today.

30
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,658
You have many secret missions
to accomplish today.

31
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,131
It's so early.

32
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,268
It is 2:00 in the afternoon,
Dragonfly.

33
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,513
Can't I sleep?

34
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,709
I never get to sleep.

35
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,082
Would you like to hear
your horoscope?

36
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,450
It's good today.

37
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,150
Mystery will be revealed
when the moon makes its orbit.

38
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,184
I love a mystery.

39
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:19,357
Fly

40
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,798
Dragonfly

41
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:26,032
Seek you out from undercover

42
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,199
Could you be my lover?

43
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,836
Together we can fly

44
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,846
Together we can fly

45
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,712
Fly

46
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,486
The water's freezing.

47
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,993
We are making cinema together!

48
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,898
We are making revolution!

49
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,099
Did I ever tell you that I was
the one who discovered her?

50
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,882
You're wonderful. Oh, yes.

51
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,186
Like that. Yes.

52
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,521
Very good.

53
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,851
This is Marlene sleeping.

54
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,123
She's mad at me today.

55
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,324
I asked her if she passed
her driving test.

56
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,833
Don't you think I would tell you
if I had passed?

57
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,801
Leave me alone!

58
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,862
Yesterday she was happy.

59
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,188
Everything is important.

60
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,985
It's all in the details,
they say.

61
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,050
This is the beginning
of a new cinema.

62
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,059
It's so delicious.

63
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,154
It's personal,
but not pretentious.

64
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,222
- It was beautiful.
- Definitive.

65
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,530
It's such an emotion
to see a film like that.

66
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,934
- Daring. Mature.
- Why are you in Paris?

67
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,165
- Which vitamin do you prefer?
- Let him speak.

68
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,674
Gentlemen, we can find out
more about a man by his dreams.

69
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,008
I guess I've always been
a bit of a daydreamer.

70
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,138
Always interested in film.

71
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,274
A lot my thoughts...

72
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,284
my little notions
of things and feelings...

73
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,479
are like little scenes
in my head.

74
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,454
I guess I want to show people
what I think about.

75
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,014
What I think is touching
or sad or funny...

76
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,492
Oops. I didn't realize
you were filming.

77
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,086
It sounded like
you were talking to yourself.

78
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,099
Just because you film every
possible thing in your life...

79
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:45,035
doesn't mean you'll understand
yourself any better.

80
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,005
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

81
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,939
Go ahead. Turn it on.

82
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,881
Go ahead. Tell me.

83
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,349
You're a warm person...

84
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,786
but closed off emotionally.

85
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,416
You're self-absorbed
and live in a fantasy world.

86
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:10,223
- Come on.
- Let me talk. It's true.

87
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,787
You've come to Paris
to find your life...

88
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:17,063
but it is in front of you,
and you won't admit it.

89
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,604
You film all the details
of things around you...

90
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,606
as if that would
bring some understanding.

91
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,802
I just want to capture
what's real and honest.

92
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,742
And what if it's boring?

93
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,247
Did you ever think about that?

94
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,214
It may not be interesting
for others to watch.

95
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,391
You're mad at me now,
aren't you?

96
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,224
Come on.
Let me fix your hair.

97
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,491
I'm just thinking about work.

98
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,658
We've been cutting the ending
for two weeks now.

99
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,167
The director has no idea
how to end the picture.

100
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,760
And he won't admit it.

101
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,305
Kiss me.

102
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,338
What are you thinking about?

103
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,475
She stands there,
looking at him.

104
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,979
She leans closer and says...

105
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,241
I love you.

106
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,044
And we have the ending.

107
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,209
It all comes together.

108
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,721
This shot is not finished yet.

109
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,450
They emerge from the tunnels...

110
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,016
and the sun rises...

111
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,757
and we see
she's joined the revolution.

112
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,804
And so...

113
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,904
it ends with
a simple declaration of love.

114
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,643
It ends with a beginning.

115
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,219
Yes, a circle. Circle.

116
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,622
Sort of circle.

117
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,592
It's great.

118
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,496
Is that the original ending?

119
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,466
You don't have an ending!

120
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,468
We make an action movie
with no action!

121
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,867
It doesn't make any sense!

122
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,236
I haven't shot the end yet.

123
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:40,371
My vision is to subvert
the audience expectations.

124
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,813
I want the end,
not with a bang...

125
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,181
but with a whimper.

126
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,244
No picture of mine
ever ended with a whimper!

127
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,847
We need a bang!
The picture is not watchable!

128
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,291
If you're thinking of changing
one frame of my revolution...

129
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,522
- You're off the picture!
- What?

130
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,121
Each moment I spend with you,
I'm losing money.

131
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,756
Fabrizio,
shut down this production.

132
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,800
What are you saying?

133
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,562
You're off the picture!

134
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,696
Fabrizio, I don't
want to see him ever again!

135
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,069
Go! Go away!

136
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,108
- You're afraid of this film!
- You're not director!

137
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,371
- You fascist! You go away!
- Andre!

138
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,710
It's the young actress!
She's gone to his head!

139
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,683
Finalmente. Eh?

140
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,083
Bullshit!

141
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,678
I have seen this happen
many times before.

142
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,917
A director falls
for the leading lady...

143
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,517
and his judgment
goes to the toilet.

144
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:33,293
Fabrizio, fire everybody
involved with this mess.

145
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,325
I have made 63 pictures,
and this is the worst.

146
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,666
See if you can bring in...
Felix DeMarco.

147
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,734
The young director.
Call him, now.

148
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,913
One, two, three, four.

149
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,548
Break on me! One, two, three!

150
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,191
Break out.
Something's not right here.

151
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,862
Felix DeMarco.

152
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,493
Now, if I'm being
totally honest...

153
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,867
which is
the point of this film...

154
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,669
just hearing his name
fills me with envy.

155
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,767
And I don't even know why
I care so much.

156
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,573
They can do whatever they want.

157
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,876
I have this film. My film.

158
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,642
So much has happened
since yesterday.

159
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,983
I lost my job.
I need to find a camera.

160
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,023
No more borrowing film.

161
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,720
Need to conserve stock.
Stay on track.

162
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,565
Everything's changing,
becoming clearer.

163
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,431
I feel like it might be
all over with Marlene.

164
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,203
I need some time
to figure things out.

165
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,179
Maybe we should live apart
for a little while.

166
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,306
No. It's me. It's all me.

167
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,613
She'll slip into bed
without a word...

168
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,017
without even a hello.

169
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,147
Maybe a scowl...

170
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,885
and I'm going
to stop her this time.

171
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,417
I missed him.

172
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,362
Did you miss me?

173
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,457
Yes!

174
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,900
How was your day?

175
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,972
How was your day?

176
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,804
Don't get it. Let's kiss.

177
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,680
Hello? Hey, Pippo.

178
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,678
Really? What, right now?

179
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,951
OK, OK.

180
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,261
They fired everybody
this morning...

181
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,095
and now
they just hired me back...

182
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,068
and I have to go to meet
the new director.

183
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,468
You're going now?

184
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,733
Till the weekend.

185
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,107
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,942
Call them and tell them
you'll go tomorrow.

187
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,606
There's nothing I can do.

188
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,981
I just get back,
you fucking ass!

189
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,917
Why are you leaving me
right now?

190
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,553
I'll make a nice salad for you.

191
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,219
I have to go.

192
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,635
I'm sorry. I'm going to cut.

193
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,608
Let's go again.

194
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,144
Can we get some more blood?

195
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,014
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Sure.

196
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,883
I'm glad you're still working
on the picture.

197
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,853
Do you know this young director,
Felix DeMarco?

198
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,756
Yeah, I met him before.

199
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,422
He's an ass. Over there.

200
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,590
You look very scary,
and action!

201
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,568
A certain number of virgins
must be given up to Satan.

202
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,504
I now give you to my master,
His Highness of Darkness...

203
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:06,910
where you will slumber forever
in the tomb of Satanic blood.

204
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,243
And... cut!
Print that one.

205
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,044
It was perfect, everyone.
Let's go to lunch.

206
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,947
Come on, baby.

207
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,747
You are getting better
and better every day.

208
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,014
Unbelievable.

209
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,990
- Enzo!
- Felix.

210
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,055
Follow me.

211
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,030
What this picture needs,
Felix, is you.

212
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,832
It needs youth,
and also... a better ending.

213
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,640
Felix, this is Paul.
He is the editor.

214
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,801
I know this guy.
How you doing?

215
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,141
You did sound on
the speedway picture, right?

216
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,112
I pulled cable for you.

217
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,274
I was awful at it, though.

218
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,877
Enzo, Paul's also done
the second unit on the picture.

219
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,420
Second unit.
That's fantastic.

220
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,083
Go ahead and tell Felix
the plot of the picture.

221
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,616
I would tell you myself,
but I'm lousy with English.

222
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,787
Go on.

223
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,093
It's a science fiction film
set in...

224
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,531
It's a good little idea, Felix.

225
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,863
You'll make it great.

226
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,030
Use the footage we have.
Cut here, cut there.

227
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,269
Add some action,
more of the girl. Very sexy.

228
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,003
I like it sexy, Enzo.

229
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,671
Keep telling the story.

230
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,615
- It's set in the future...
- The year is 2001.

231
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,050
We have one hell of a setup.

232
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,610
Real sexy stuff.

233
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,691
Go ahead, Paul. Go. Go.

234
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,818
There's a group
of revolutionaries...

235
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,158
hiding out on a moon base...

236
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,130
and there's only one answer.

237
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,064
Gentlemen, I want
to thank you for attending...

238
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,074
this emergency
security session.

239
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,168
This visual report
will illustrate our problem.

240
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,681
Recent intelligence reports...

241
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,582
indicate that a band
of youthful revolutionaries...

242
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,088
have set up a secret base
in the far out region...

243
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,556
of the dark side of the moon.

244
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,083
Their leader is a man
who's known as Mr. E.

245
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,154
His many followers
regard him as a great poet...

246
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:10,964
orator, inventor,
and expert in martial arts.

247
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,364
He appears to be leading his
group in training exercises...

248
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,377
which we believe are linked
to a plan to attack Earth...

249
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,404
to spread his dangerous
anarchistic philosophy.

250
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,610
Not since our troubles began
way back in May, 1968...

251
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:31,315
have we seen
such a cause for concern.

252
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,982
Most distressing
are the reports...

253
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,253
that he has developed
a top-secret weapon...

254
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,855
which we feel we must capture
to preserve our way of life.

255
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,867
Gentlemen,
we're left with only one option.

256
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,335
To use Agent Codename:
Dragonfly.

257
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,374
- But she's so expensive.
- And so difficult.

258
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:53,138
I know she's exasperating,
but we need her.

259
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,375
Now, I've arranged
a teleconference.

260
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,576
Please, Agent Dragonfly.
We had an appointment.

261
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,118
I need my sleep.

262
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,279
We need to get down to business.

263
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,983
OK. What is it?

264
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,754
Your mission is
to infiltrate the community...

265
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,022
by whatever means available...

266
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:15,032
find Mr. E, and
take possession of his weapon.

267
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,071
He's pretty cute, isn't he?

268
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,008
Please. Are you prepared
to accept this mission?

269
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,679
I'll take the mission,
but you know how much I cost.

270
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,045
Of course.

271
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,016
We're relying on you,
Dragonfly.

272
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,216
The future of the world
is in your hands.

273
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:58,937
So, are you prepared
to take this mission?

274
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,571
If you can meet my price.

275
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,877
That sounds like fun.
I love science fiction.

276
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,541
I could probably
make this amazing.

277
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,312
I want to tighten it up...

278
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,115
reshoot some things,
fix the ending...

279
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,088
because you don't
seem to have that...

280
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,851
and...

281
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,393
I could start once
the vampire picture wraps.

282
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,021
Perfect.
While Felix shoots...

283
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,361
we continue with the trailer
and the looping.

284
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,629
Felix, give the editor
your thoughts on the trailer.

285
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,671
Stick to Felix like glue.

286
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,798
Hear his ideas, his visions.
Write it.

287
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,139
Yes, we have to go.
We have another projection.

288
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,906
The Three Killers, no?

289
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,173
It just hit me.

290
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,547
I know how the trailer
needs to be.

291
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,288
Are you going back to set?

292
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,800
I'll let you know if
I get any other great ideas!

293
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,429
And we're up! We're back!

294
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,702
I want two cameras
and another here with me!

295
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,968
We're going to do two!

296
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,719
So, we finally meet.

297
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,794
I like what I see.

298
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,707
- I'm Paul.
- Valentine.

299
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,834
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

300
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,471
The director's still on his way.

301
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,572
I'll just get us set up
in the meantime.

302
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,116
Sorry about my voice.

303
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,175
My apartment's flooding.
I'm getting a cold.

304
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,983
You'll be fine. Maybe it's...

305
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,793
I was just...

306
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,698
I was just...

307
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,993
- Would you like some tea?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,663
Paul... Felix is missing.

309
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,229
Go ahead and get
the session going. Come on.

310
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,707
Yes, yes. People, come on.

311
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,835
- Ever done this before?
- No.

312
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,243
It's pretty easy.

313
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,847
There you go.

314
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,054
So, we finally meet.

315
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,098
I like what I see.

316
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,400
I have a mission,
which I intend to accomplish.

317
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,377
I love you.

318
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,880
I love you.

319
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,712
I'm so in love with you.

320
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,582
Do you love me?

321
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,714
I'm in love with you.

322
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,256
I love you.

323
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,093
That's OK.

324
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,357
Changing rolls. Sorry.

325
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,432
You have an eyelash right here.

326
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,478
If you blow on it,
you can make a wish.

327
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,278
I wish cats could talk.

328
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,315
You're not supposed to tell me.
It won't come true.

329
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,422
I'm sure it'll come true.

330
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,086
My cat's pregnant.

331
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,791
I wish I could talk to her.

332
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,367
- Can I get you to sign this?
- Sure.

333
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,610
You must be the director.

334
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,275
How exactly
you want me to do this?

335
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,549
With a lot of authority,
or maybe more playful?

336
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,688
Who is Dragonfly?
She's a super-sexy secret agent.

337
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,127
But that's top secret.

338
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,392
Dragonfly is coming.

339
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,060
- How do you like it? Good?
- It's great.

340
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,433
You hear me? One, two, three.

341
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,701
You hear me?
Dazzling? It's OK.

342
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,299
Dazzling is terrific.
Dragonfly is terrific.

343
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,345
- Everything else good.
- It's great.

344
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,813
Thank you. Thanks.
Just try them.

345
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,180
Where'd she go?

346
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,014
Out that way.

347
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,815
Who is Dragonfly?

348
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,131
Hi, Valentine.
Felix DeMarco, the director.

349
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,571
How are you?
Sorry I'm late.

350
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,074
I'm just... crazy.

351
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,576
Actually,
we already finished.

352
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,772
Oh, great.
Want to get a bite to eat?

353
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:36,905
Sure.

354
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,542
- Do you have any francs?
- Yeah. I do.

355
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:43,816
I'm fresh out.
I know a little great place.

356
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,085
Do you use The Method?

357
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,157
Do we have to do this now?

358
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,822
Yeah. That's the thing.

359
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,459
I have to do it,
even if I don't want to.

360
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,163
It's the only way
to be honest and real.

361
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,865
Have you seen my light meter?

362
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,108
You didn't tell me your father
was coming for Christmas.

363
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,619
I'm sorry. I forgot.
He's on a lecture tour.

364
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,280
Just be passing through
the airport for an hour or two.

365
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,118
Asked me to meet him there.

366
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,386
You never tell me anything.

367
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:29,424
What was the actress like?

368
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,869
She's a nice girl.

369
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,769
And?

370
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,637
Am I in frame?

371
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,352
Today is December 20th, 1969.

372
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,981
I have to stay focused.
Complete honesty.

373
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,285
Do you love me?

374
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,287
You know how I feel about you.

375
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,660
You just want me to say it
in front of my camera?

376
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,256
Why can't you just say it?

377
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:07,738
I sew your ripped pants.
I trip over your camera.

378
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,036
I love you, of course.

379
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,567
I just don't
want to run out of film.

380
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,040
What are you looking for?

381
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,641
What do you mean?

382
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,949
What is your biggest wish?

383
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,127
That cats could talk.

384
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,460
Something that girl said,
isn't it?

385
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,727
What are you talking about?
You're being silly.

386
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,598
I thought you had to be
totally honest in this film.

387
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,467
I am.

388
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,030
You're being ridiculous.

389
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,803
Who said that? That actress?

390
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,605
You want to sleep with her!

391
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:50,045
- Now, that's ridiculous.
- What is your problem?

392
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,640
I can't believe you!
I just don't understand!

393
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,480
We need to talk.

394
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,658
Hey, Paul.
Ready to go to the party?

395
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,069
Let me drive.

396
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,338
Did you pass
your driving test finally?

397
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,986
Maybe you can drive
on the way home.

398
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,926
I got a call from the hospital.

399
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,329
Felix was in a car accident.

400
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,732
Smashed up his Alfa.

401
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,794
The doctor said he was OK.

402
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,204
Just broke his leg.

403
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,139
He's getting out of
the Dragonfly picture...

404
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,506
taking a break.

405
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,442
- Really?
- Yeah.

406
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,380
I want to recommend you to Enzo.

407
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,510
Me?

408
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,816
I think
you should finish the film.

409
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,815
I know you can do a good job.
You're a talented kid.

410
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,862
You have helped
the picture a lot.

411
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,191
I have seen that...

412
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,959
in the second unit shots
I have gotten.

413
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,935
The footage
of the cosmic rays...

414
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,538
that was your idea.

415
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,583
It's a good idea.

416
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,218
We talk to him tomorrow.

417
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,496
It is sonic boom
of the Concorde.

418
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,661
It's so fucking amazing.
We're living in the future, man.

419
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,729
...acting is to the scenario.

420
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,433
I found this great place
in St. Germain.

421
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,408
Would you excuse me one second?

422
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,445
I've got some big news.

423
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:11,073
Can't you see I'm talking
to someone right now?

424
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,548
Give me two minutes.

425
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,778
Excuse me,
you were saying?

426
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,718
It's called
theater of revolution.

427
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,951
It's going to be a movement,
a voice, a poetry workshop.

428
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,821
I'm sure you'd love this place.

429
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:25,294
- Did you hear about poor Felix?
- I hope he's OK.

430
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,955
He's so talented.

431
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,192
Working with him
is so much fun.

432
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,292
I remember once,
when we finished early...

433
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,132
and he took us all
to the go-kart ride.

434
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,037
Oh, God! Come here.

435
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,372
- That nobody can deny...
- Hey, babe!

436
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,710
For he's a jolly good fellow

437
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,477
For he's a jolly good fellow

438
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,984
It's Felix DeMarco!

439
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,781
That nobody can deny

440
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,481
That nobody can deny

441
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,354
Thank you. Thank you.
So kind.

442
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,258
Ladies and gentlemen...

443
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,161
I'd like
to make an announcement.

444
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,528
I'm sure
you've probably heard...

445
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,760
about the mad events
of this evening...

446
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,894
but we're OK, right?

447
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,430
But there's one more thing
that happened.

448
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,138
I asked Brigit to marry me...

449
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,945
and she said yes!

450
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,351
And so, we can't wait
one moment further...

451
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,855
and we're
setting sail tomorrow.

452
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:37,263
Don't stand around
staring at us!

453
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,700
Let's dance!

454
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,548
Dad. Dad.

455
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,987
Hey, you all right?

456
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,288
Yeah. I misplaced my glasses
on the plane.

457
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,453
Thank you very much.

458
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,156
Let me hold your hand.

459
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,302
Hold on. Wait.

460
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,603
I took a sleeping pill,
and I ate all the ice cream.

461
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,446
It's good to see you.

462
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,417
Good to see you at Christmas,
even briefly.

463
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,284
Wait a second.
I brought you something.

464
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,086
Thanks, Dad.

465
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,863
I had a dream the other night...

466
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,422
and I thought of you.

467
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,435
Well, you were in it.

468
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,403
I was watching these...

469
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:51,602
hideous films of Vietnam
on the television.

470
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:55,772
And I had
this deep, desultory dream...

471
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,578
where I met a son
that I didn't know I had.

472
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,784
And he looked like you.

473
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,484
You were there, too.
Two brothers.

474
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,291
But then I realized that
he was a soldier in the war.

475
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,491
And when I woke up,
I had these...

476
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:20,629
these feelings
of worry and of loss.

477
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,468
And I wondered...

478
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,304
this is curious...

479
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,241
could I have had a child
by another woman...

480
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,473
and never known about it?

481
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,015
Isn't that a curious thought?

482
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,014
I think about it
sometimes and...

483
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,785
What if I met a boy
and he looked like you?

484
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,791
Maybe it's really my son.

485
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,630
Sometimes I'll be driving
down the street...

486
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,260
and I'll see someone
who looks familiar...

487
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,464
like it could be my brother.

488
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,530
You know?

489
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,507
So, maybe it's true, Dad.

490
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,871
It is possible, Paul.

491
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,246
I wasn't always faithful
to your mother.

492
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,352
When I was your age...

493
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,652
all I could think about
was women.

494
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,091
It was like a disease
or a curse.

495
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,356
I think I know
what you mean, Dad.

496
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,779
Kids are nice.

497
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,882
When do you think
you'll have some of your own?

498
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,312
I don't know, Dad.

499
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,292
Have you thought about
coming back home?

500
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,055
Your mother wanted me
to ask you.

501
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,653
I don't know.

502
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,699
Excuse me.
We found your glasses.

503
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,701
Oh, thank you.

504
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,737
Thank you very much.

505
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,998
Wow.

506
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,680
I think it's time to go.

507
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,419
I'm very glad for you, Paul.

508
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,148
I know you'll do well
in this new job of yours.

509
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,780
What is it?

510
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,586
It's a science-fiction film...

511
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,390
about a futuristic spy
named Dragonfly.

512
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,522
That's interesting.

513
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,930
Your grandmother
used to call dragonflies...

514
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,798
the Devil's darning needles.

515
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,200
She told me that
they come in the night...

516
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,136
and stitch up your mouth
if you use profanity...

517
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,764
or were otherwise voluble.

518
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,365
This isn't exactly about that.

519
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,877
Maybe you can use it somehow.

520
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,071
Thanks, Dad.

521
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,444
You never know when
some little overheard story...

522
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,484
or image can find a place
in your work.

523
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,183
Here.

524
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,997
- OK, see you.
- See you.

525
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,434
How was it seeing your father?

526
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,935
It was nice.

527
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,494
He told me about
this strange dream that he had.

528
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,201
I'm going out to get some milk.

529
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,800
Action!

530
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,839
Give me some screaming, girls.

531
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,501
Louder!

532
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,342
Now give me some moaning.

533
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,014
Louder!

534
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,210
You did good work
on the trailer.

535
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,275
Thank you, sir.

536
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,514
Fabrizio says you know
the space picture...

537
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,352
better than anyone else...

538
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,655
and thinks you should take over.

539
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,321
He usually knows
what he's talking about.

540
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:47,898
So, you make some shorts,
films, things like that?

541
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,600
- I'm working on a film.
- Come here.

542
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:57,205
Now, there are
two kinds of movies.

543
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,647
Those with an ending,
and those without an ending.

544
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,810
This movie needs an ending.

545
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,945
I've made some fifty pictures...

546
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,046
and this is my advice...

547
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:09,991
the ending is the most important
part of the movie.

548
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,825
The part that people remember
when they leave the theater...

549
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,697
but everybody works on it last
when they are exhausted.

550
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,894
So, listen to me...

551
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,133
and figure out
how to end this picture...

552
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,071
with an exciting twist.

553
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,665
And that we can do it
in two days.

554
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,802
Yes, that we can shoot
in two days!

555
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,478
I'll be in Rome
for the holidays...

556
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,677
and Fabrizio
will get you out there...

557
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,413
and you can show me
what you're thinking.

558
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,715
Francheschino!

559
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,121
And you... astonish me.

560
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,347
I'll have a cocktail.

561
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,757
Your cocktail is ready,
Dragonfly.

562
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,114
Attention, all comrades.

563
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,660
We will soon be ready
to leave our lunar domes...

564
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,492
to descend
and bring change to Earth.

565
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,696
We need to be free...

566
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,135
to make love all day.

567
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,835
Every day.

568
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,809
Must be free.

569
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,551
So... we finally meet.

570
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,720
I like what I see.

571
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,725
I've been expecting you.

572
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,624
Hope you're not disappointed.

573
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,219
I knew it was only
a matter of time...

574
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,959
before they sent in
Agent Codename: Dragonfly.

575
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,661
You've got quite a reputation.

576
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,728
Really? Tell me about it.

577
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,899
Work with the revolution,
Dragonfly. Join us.

578
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,000
I have a mission...

579
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,011
which I intend to accomplish.

580
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,108
There she is!

581
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,537
Fabulous.

582
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,523
Preparing boosters.

583
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,667
Stand by.

584
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,666
There she is!

585
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,948
There's
too many loose ends here.

586
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,680
This gun...

587
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,280
What is so special
about this gun?

588
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,122
We got a Christmas gift.

589
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,219
Have a look.

590
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:41,730
It's a present from the guys
in the screening room.

591
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,289
What a temper.

592
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,835
Andrezej was so mad that day.

593
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,342
The mysterious, dark figure.
Who should that be?

594
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,809
Paul, relax.
It's just a movie.

595
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,747
I can't find reel seven here.

596
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,283
What is this?

597
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,486
Oh, Madonna.

598
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,493
Paul, reel seven.

599
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,468
It will take me days
to put it back together.

600
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,028
A message.

601
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,437
It's written in the code
from the movie.

602
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,872
Yeah. Film 37.

603
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,371
Checking code book.

604
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:32,677
All right. D-e...

605
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,843
"Defilers beware.

606
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,547
"Defilers beware,
exclamation point?"

607
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:41,057
Who sent this?

608
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,685
Andrezej.

609
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:48,255
Oh, God, Andrezej.
It has to be him.

610
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:51,961
He has a key to the door.
This is bad news.

611
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,004
Damn. I knew it. He's crazy!

612
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,698
And you know what?

613
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,241
I'm sure he cut the brakes
on Felix's car.

614
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,277
Jesus. You know...

615
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,345
I'm calling the locksmith.

616
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,644
You know what?
You better watch out, Paul.

617
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,922
Damn. He's crazy. I knew it!

618
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,619
He cut the film
in a million pieces.

619
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,300
I want to see your soul
in action.

620
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,732
I love you.

621
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,500
Take your time. Not so fast.

622
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:32,269
- I love you.
- Like that, yes.

623
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,810
Say "I'm in love with you."

624
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,139
I'm in love with you.

625
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,407
- One more time.
- Shut up.

626
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,073
Transmission breach.

627
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,186
Need assistance.

628
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,121
Need assistance.
Ship's been damaged.

629
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,897
Hey, you got my message.

630
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,732
Come in.

631
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,338
It must be freezing out.

632
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,641
I've tried everything
to fix this...

633
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,147
but I can't figure out
how it goes back together.

634
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,944
Let me take a look.

635
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,308
You look cold.

636
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,114
I'm all right now.

637
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,311
We'll be out of here in no time.

638
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:59,355
What are you doing on the moon?

639
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,947
I don't know.

640
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,856
I think I'm lost.

641
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,034
Dragonfly...

642
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,161
what happens in the end?

643
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:17,571
I don't know, but don't worry.

644
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,438
We're going to find out soon.

645
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,614
Hey, what happened?

646
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,352
Are you OK?

647
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,951
Was someone here?

648
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,155
I'm just sad.

649
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,769
I'm losing all my patience
with you.

650
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,279
You talk to your camera
night and days...

651
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,283
but you never talk to me.

652
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,880
Why don't
you say anything to me?

653
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,595
What should I say?

654
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,393
I don't know what to say.

655
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,530
I'm sorry you're sad.

656
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,810
Come here.

657
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,565
I don't know what I'm doing.

658
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,962
I don't know
if I have any ideas.

659
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,031
They want something that
I'm not sure I can give them.

660
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,670
Maybe I should just go to Rome
and tell them...

661
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,307
"I don't know what to do
with your idiotic story."

662
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:17,786
It's not even my film.

663
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,084
And this ending...

664
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,425
Paul, I'm glad
you're saying all this to me...

665
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,363
but I don't care about
the stupid film.

666
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,266
I care about us
like we used to be.

667
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,928
Come here. Come here.

668
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,165
Now go.

669
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,673
Go to Rome.
Do what you like...

670
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,576
but just remember that you
bring everything upon yourself.

671
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,545
That came for you.

672
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:17,843
You spent all your money
on a camera.

673
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,473
You are here.

674
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,344
These are good, don't you think?

675
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,677
It's very nice.

676
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,377
Not too bad. Sit down.

677
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,819
Good, good, good.

678
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,516
OK, so...

679
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,560
do you have
a great ending for me?

680
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,696
I recut most of the picture...

681
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,356
to make it
shorter and clearer.

682
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,993
And one of my ideas
is to take Mr. E's gun...

683
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,094
and make it
a little more special...

684
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,163
so it can temporarily
freeze people.

685
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,573
Freeze people. Sounds good.

686
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,372
And that's how
they plan to take over.

687
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:01,282
What about the ending?

688
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,083
The alley...

689
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,282
Dragonfly's running,
chasing after the guy.

690
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,325
What happens?

691
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,656
Well...

692
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,320
I have a few ideas.

693
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:16,365
That's the problem.
You got too many ideas.

694
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,424
We just need one good one.

695
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:24,631
Look, son, this is
my thirty-seventh picture.

696
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,609
I've worked with some
of the best in the business...

697
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,668
and I've learned
a few little tricks.

698
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:33,512
One of them is to always try
to make the audience...

699
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,848
wonder what's going to happen.

700
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,354
And then at the end,
you tell them...

701
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,084
but you surprise them
a little, eh?

702
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,456
Easy.

703
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,360
Look, it's New Year's Eve.

704
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,865
You are going to the party.
Come with us. Let's have fun.

705
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,697
Oh, my little monster.

706
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:55,567
Julietta.
Come on, come with us.

707
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,368
Paul, go ahead to the party.

708
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:04,038
Have a good time.
We'll be right back.

709
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:39,742
Valentine!

710
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,548
There you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

711
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,319
Listen, I know you've been
working on that ending...

712
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,654
which is exciting
because it got me thinking.

713
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:27,663
This ending has to be fabulous.
I imagine a new scene.

714
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,665
I'm parachuting
down to Earth...

715
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:32,497
Where did you go?
You just left me standing there.

716
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,833
Excuse me.
I'm talking to my director.

717
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,910
Thank you.
I think I'll just walk.

718
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,227
Hold on.

719
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:48,796
There you go.

720
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,601
- Are you English?
- American.

721
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,197
What are you doing here?

722
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,302
I don't know.
What are you doing here?

723
00:56:56,379 --> 00:57:00,179
My friend is waiting for a boy.
He's in the army.

724
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,377
They haven't seen each other
for one year.

725
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,818
He wrote her and
say that he would run away...

726
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,823
from the army
and meet her here tonight.

727
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,277
1970.

728
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,817
It's a whole new decade...

729
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:40,481
but it still
feels the same to me.

730
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:43,856
So, let's hear it.

731
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:48,523
So, Dragonfly's
running through the tunnel.

732
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,931
She comes to the figure
hidden in the shadows.

733
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,866
And the figure emerges.

734
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,000
And the figure...

735
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,490
Your book!

736
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,831
That cats could talk.

737
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,961
I thought you had to be
totally honest in this film.

738
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,010
- Absolutely pretentious.
- Indulgent.

739
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,103
You're just fucking blowing it.

740
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,410
This film is too fractured.
It's confusing.

741
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,848
It's an aggression
for your eyes, for my eyes.

742
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,079
Especially the shot
where you sit on the toilet.

743
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,748
Where's the story?
Where's the structure?

744
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:56,291
I don't care about this person.

745
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,259
Do you think you are clever?

746
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,886
I just wanted
to make something...

747
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,692
that would reflect
who I am, who I was.

748
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,358
It was a difficult
and confusing time.

749
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,594
What's the point?

750
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,698
What am I supposed to do?

751
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,864
And regarding that space project
you're involved in...

752
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,874
there's no snow on the moon.

753
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,034
- Wait!
- You should know that.

754
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,805
What should I do?

755
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:19,109
You need to connect things
so they make us feel something.

756
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,124
You surprised me.
I didn't see you there.

757
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,261
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

758
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,332
Would you please let me know if
I'm not doing something right?

759
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,877
It's my first day, so...

760
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,277
It'll be fine.

761
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:00,747
Remind me about the scene
in the story...

762
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,307
right before
the one we're shooting.

763
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,013
You... I mean, Dragonfly
had just barely escaped...

764
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,080
with this special gun
from the dark side of the moon.

765
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,955
How does my spaceship
get fixed?

766
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:14,087
I came to the moon
and fixed it for you.

767
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,793
Then you landed safely in Paris.

768
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:30,642
Landing successful.

769
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:34,240
Please notify the Corporation
that the mission's complete.

770
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:35,477
Affirmative.

771
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,027
You didn't knock.

772
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,767
I wanted to surprise you,
my darling.

773
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,482
Dragonfly

774
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:48,547
Tell me,
how can you resist her

775
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:52,287
Until your lips have kissed her

776
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:57,162
She'll be a mystery

777
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,600
Please don't try to stop me.

778
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,203
I'm sorry.

779
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,341
He kills me?

780
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,346
The gun doesn't work on you.

781
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,245
Why not?

782
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,580
I'll explain later,
but what happens...

783
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,414
is the gun actually
has a special property.

784
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,214
The revolution
depends on this weapon...

785
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,793
The gun freezes people.

786
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,490
Interesting.

787
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,999
So, what happens next?

788
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,431
Incoming call on cine-com.

789
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,113
Do you have possession
of the package? Please respond.

790
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,342
Affirmative.

791
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,697
I'm sorry.

792
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,797
Bring it down. You all right?

793
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:14,365
Sorry, I didn't realize...
I'm fine. My foot...

794
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,035
All right, we'll go again.

795
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,704
It was our fault.
Bring her up, please.

796
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:32,312
Someone stole the exposed film.

797
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,773
Paul, go.

798
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,036
Here.

799
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,763
Are you scared?

800
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,384
Oops.

801
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,167
- You OK?
- Yeah.

802
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,332
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

803
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:45,918
Go.

804
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,820
How could you betray me?

805
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,523
Destroy my artwork,
you little shit!

806
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:31,259
Do you think that you can
make a better ending...

807
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,801
by putting in your car chase?

808
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:36,838
What about the theme?
The story?

809
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:38,305
Have you
thought about that, Paul?

810
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:39,671
- I wasn't trying...
- Bullshit!

811
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,734
Don't move! I'm warning you!

812
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:48,908
I'm sorry.

813
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:51,851
It's a big opportunity for me...

814
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,253
You want
to know the real reason?

815
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:57,417
They are afraid about the film.

816
01:09:57,493 --> 01:10:00,462
They're trying to keep
the youth rebellion suppressed.

817
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:04,295
A film can change
the course of the future.

818
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:09,736
It can invent the future
by making ideas concrete.

819
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:13,263
That's why when I heard
you were changing the ending...

820
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,934
I was forced to do this.

821
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,272
I had an idea.

822
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:19,212
I had a new idea for the ending,
that maybe she...

823
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:23,149
the Corporation, its center,
betrays her.

824
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:34,792
The revolutionary get
their weapon back in the end.

825
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,491
Promise me that, Paul.

826
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,229
I promise.

827
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:48,774
Good.

828
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:54,412
I've been working
on a personal film.

829
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:56,781
Personal film?

830
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,320
With no compromise, right?

831
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:01,913
- Right.
- We'll...

832
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:04,050
see about you.

833
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,728
I'm old.

834
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:11,254
I can go now and write
my personal work.

835
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:18,665
Now that I have something
to write about.

836
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,410
I have to ask...

837
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,285
Did you make love to her?

838
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,060
Did you cut the brakes
on Felix's car?

839
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,237
Remember, Paul...

840
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:52,900
always stand
next to the camera.

841
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,603
Your actor
will feel you there...

842
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:59,045
and will be playing
just for you.

843
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:11,151
I can't believe it.

844
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:13,091
Bravo! Did they catch him?

845
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,493
Who was the son of a bitch
who stole the film?

846
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:15,791
Just some old guy.

847
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,958
It doesn't matter anyway.
We got it back.

848
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,365
It's all going to work out.

849
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,564
We'll get the final footage
tomorrow on the stage.

850
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:27,006
- You did good, Paul.
- Where's Valentine? Is she OK?

851
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:30,477
She was fine. In fact,
I think she enjoyed herself.

852
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,878
She just left in a rush.

853
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,280
She asked that you call her.

854
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,081
She said it was important.

855
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:41,054
Antonio, come on, eh?

856
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,062
Hi, it's Paul.

857
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,224
You got to come here quickly.

858
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,767
Oh, my God!

859
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,068
Taxi!

860
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,127
Come look.

861
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,471
They were just born.

862
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,952
I like to document
all the things of my life.

863
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,228
I found you.

864
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:12,931
I was cold.

865
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,442
Thank you very much.

866
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,452
All right.

867
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,690
And...

868
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:41,964
And action.

869
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,255
But how?

870
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,757
You're me.

871
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,463
Quickly, we're in danger.

872
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:13,468
Nice try, Dragonfly.

873
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,002
Go, go!

874
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,367
My father built
the Dragonfly robot...

875
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,669
for the most dangerous
missions.

876
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,300
He modeled her on me...

877
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:30,811
her looks and
her lifelike qualities.

878
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,938
But the Corporation
programmed her...

879
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,745
so that
she couldn't betray them.

880
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,615
She wanted to help you,
but she couldn't.

881
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,416
That's why I tried to help.

882
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,014
I knew the revolution
needed this weapon...

883
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,423
so I took it to give to you.

884
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:49,225
I did it to help you,
to help the cause.

885
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:52,858
I believe in this revolution...

886
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:55,698
and I believe in you.

887
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:00,039
We were in love.

888
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:04,834
We are identical
in all respects.

889
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,948
In all respects?

890
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,109
In all respects.

891
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,490
All I really did was stitch
together things from my life.

892
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,496
Things that made
an impression on me.

893
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,998
Just put a little piece
of myself out there...

894
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,693
try to organize it,
take a look at it...

895
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:02,760
make some connections,
some sense of things.

896
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:04,703
I think that's
all the time we have.

897
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:06,206
Thanks a lot to Paul.

898
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,440
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

899
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,280
I enjoyed what you had to say.

900
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:18,614
Thank you very much.

901
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,815
By the way,
do you know Felix DeMarco?

902
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:26,351
Do you think you could pass
this script on to him for me?

903
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,397
- Sure.
- Thanks.

904
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,468
My dog knocked over the tripod,
and the camera kept running...

905
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,597
so I kept it all in the film.

906
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,778
...things around you...

907
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:49,316
as if that would bring
some understanding?

908
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:51,978
I just want to capture
what's real and honest.

909
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,918
And what if it's boring?

910
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,388
Maybe Marlene was right...

911
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:59,291
but each one of these images
brings up a feeling or a memory.

912
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:03,297
I can smell Marlene when
I see this shot of the soap.

913
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:06,198
I found her drivers license...

914
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:08,600
and I tried to reach her
by calling her mother...

915
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,467
and Marlene answered.

916
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,235
When she heard my voice,
she hung up.

917
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,541
I thought that my film
was going to be about...

918
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:23,174
Iooking at
all the pieces of myself...

919
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,310
but, Marlene...

920
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:28,322
I got you in pieces, too.

921
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:35,953
So this is the end...

922
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,932
or is it the start?

923
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,592
Of what?
