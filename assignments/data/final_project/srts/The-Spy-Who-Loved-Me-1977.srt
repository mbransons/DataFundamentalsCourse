1
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,291
Captain wants you
to keep 500 feet.

2
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,827
Maneuvering, Control.
Come in shallow to 500 feet.

3
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,109
- Keep 500 feet.
- Keep 500 feet, sir.

4
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:36,609
What the hell's going on, Eddie?

5
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:41,604
Emergency stations.
Captain to the control room.

6
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,984
- What's going on?
- Number five bulkhead shut down.

7
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:48,146
- Control, Maneuvering.
- Control, Captain.

8
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:51,123
I'm losing electrical frequency.
I'll have to break down the system.

9
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,522
Control, Sound Room.

10
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:59,824
Total loss of power
on all sonar sets.

11
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,061
Surface.
Blow forward, blow aft, full ahead.

12
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:04,297
Full rise on both planes.
Raise the search periscope.

13
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:26,658
Oh, my God.

14
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:28,854
Yeah, put him through.

15
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,362
Good morning, sir.

16
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,165
No, First Sea Lord.

17
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:36,498
There's been no contact
with Ranger yet, sir.

18
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,266
No sightings,
no distress signals, sir.

19
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,805
It looks very much like it.

20
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,810
Yes, of course I will, sir.

21
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:50,783
We've lost one
of our nuclear submarines.

22
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:57,121
What?

23
00:02:57,191 --> 00:03:01,218
The submarine Potempkin
disappeared without trace?

24
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,924
What a catastrophe, Comrade Chairman.

25
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:10,094
Yes, of course.
I'll assign our best agent immediately.

26
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,977
- Rubelvitch, where is Agent XXX?
- On leave, General.

27
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:20,946
At a people's rest
and recuperation center.

28
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:33,492
It's been a wonderful weekend.

29
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:37,428
- I shall never forget it.
- Nor will I.

30
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,431
When can we meet again?

31
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,798
As soon as my mission
is accomplished.

32
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:49,542
I must go.
I have to be in Austria tonight.

33
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,043
Five more minutes.

34
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:01,276
Agent XXX.
Calling Agent XXX.

35
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,721
You will report to headquarters
immediately.

36
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,725
Agent XXX,
acknowledge and verify.

37
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:19,163
This is XXX.
Message received and understood.

38
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,369
Yes, Mr. Prime Minister. I understand
the gravity of the situation.

39
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:27,440
Yes, I'll put our best man on it
at once.

40
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:29,981
Good-bye.

41
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,484
Moneypenny, where is 007?

42
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,618
He's on a mission, sir,
in Austria.

43
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:44,391
Tell him to pull out,
immediately.

44
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:57,336
Oh, James,
I cannot find the words.

45
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,239
Let me try
and enlarge your vocabulary.

46
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,938
What's happened?

47
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:29,809
- Where are you going?
- Sorry, darling. Something came up.

48
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:38,108
But, James, I need you.

49
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,617
So does England.

50
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:51,821
He has just left.

51
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:53,558
Over and out.

52
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:56,362
Message received. We are waiting.
Over and out.

53
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,314
Now.

54
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:15,405
Nobody does it better

55
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:23,406
Makes me feel sad for the rest

56
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:29,084
Nobody does it

57
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:33,784
Half as good as you

58
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:38,090
Baby, you're the best

59
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:43,964
I wasn't looking

60
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:46,765
But somehow you found me

61
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:49,930
I tried to hide from

62
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:54,445
Your love light

63
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:58,039
But like heaven above me

64
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:01,051
The spy who loved me

65
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:06,352
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

66
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:13,856
And nobody does it better

67
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,761
Though sometimes I wish

68
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:22,067
Someone could

69
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:26,833
Nobody does it

70
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:30,005
Quite the way you do

71
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:35,376
Why do you have to be so good

72
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:41,220
The way that you hold me

73
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:45,126
Whenever you hold me

74
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:47,357
There's some kind of magic

75
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:52,267
Inside you

76
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:55,500
That keeps me from running

77
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:58,371
But just keep it coming

78
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:03,938
How'd you learn
to do the things you do

79
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:32,434
Baby, baby

80
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,206
Baby, you're the best

81
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:50,587
Send in Agent XXX.

82
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,337
You sent for me, Comrade General.

83
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:06,865
Good morning. Major Amasova,
we are facing a most delicate situation.

84
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:10,572
Our nuclear submarine Potempkin
has disappeared.

85
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:12,080
Sabotage?

86
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:15,379
That is for you to find out.
We have one lead:

87
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,385
A connection in Cairo.

88
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,886
You leave tonight.

89
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,650
Will that be all?

90
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,093
There is one more thing.

91
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:32,125
I regret to inform you, Major, that
Agent Sergei Borzov has been killed.

92
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:40,103
On a mission at Berngarten
in the Austrian Alps.

93
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:44,877
A tragic occurrence,
Comrade General.

94
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:47,541
It had not escaped our notice
that you and Agent Borzov...

95
00:11:47,617 --> 00:11:51,053
had been more than friends
for some time.

96
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,553
I'm very sorry.

97
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:54,522
How did he die?

98
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,080
We haven't all the details yet.

99
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,289
It appears he'd become involved
in a British Secret Service operation.

100
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:04,127
Please keep me informed,
Comrade General.

101
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,134
I should very much like to meet...

102
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:08,568
whoever was responsible
for his death.

103
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:37,494
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

104
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,501
- Good morning, 007.
- Hello, Q.

105
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:42,504
- Mission successful?
- On and off.

106
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:44,904
- Good morning, Commander.
- Good morning, sir.

107
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,568
- Captain Forsyth.
- Sir.

108
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,167
Commander Bond, sir.

109
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:51,839
- Mr. Fredrick Gray, Minister of Defense.
- Good morning, Commander.

110
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:54,883
Admiral Hargreaves,
Flag Officer, Submarines.

111
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:57,351
- Ark Royal, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,651
- I believe M told you about this.
- Yes, Minister.

113
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:02,657
Over here, please, gentlemen.

114
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:32,944
This, I take it, is Ranger's
prearranged coastal patrol area.

115
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:36,856
- That's right.
- How many people knew this course?

116
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,655
Admiral Hargreaves, myself...

117
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:40,923
and Talbot, the submarine captain.

118
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,105
Good God.

119
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:56,277
Where did this come from?

120
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,575
I'm sorry, Benson.
For the moment, that's top secret.

121
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:01,879
I see, sir.
Commander, this tracing means...

122
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:06,581
that the Russians can track our nuclear
submarines underwater and sink them.

123
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:09,420
- I believe it does.
- How could they? It's impossible.

124
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,827
It's quite simple.

125
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,729
Heat signature recognition,
most likely.

126
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,892
- With your permission, Minister?
- Yes, of course.

127
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,560
Thank you.

128
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:23,503
We already know that satellites
with infrared heat sensors...

129
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:26,838
can detect a nuclear missile
in flight by its tail fire.

130
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,240
Well?

131
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:31,747
Someone can now locate
a submerged nuclear submarine...

132
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:36,251
in exactly the same way,
by its wake.

133
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:40,449
That means they can totally undermine
our Western defense strategy.

134
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:41,956
Yes, it looks like it.

135
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:45,360
Where did we get that tracing, Freddie?

136
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:47,692
Cairo, diplomatic bag.

137
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:51,790
Somebody got the plans of that tracking
system and is trying to sell them.

138
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:54,701
They sent us that tracing as proof
that it's genuine.

139
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,739
Then, if there is a deal to be made,
the price will be high.

140
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:00,935
"High"? Astronomical.

141
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,969
That missing submarine
had 16 Polaris missiles aboard.

142
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:08,410
We have a contact in Egypt?

143
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:11,920
M will give you the details.
You leave tonight.

144
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:24,965
Dr. Bechmann
and Professor Markovitz.

145
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:26,626
Thank you.

146
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:30,194
Gentlemen, now that the moment
has come to bid you farewell...

147
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:33,538
I congratulate both you, Doctor,
and you, Professor...

148
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:36,669
on your brilliant work
in the development...

149
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,112
of the submarine tracking system.

150
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:42,275
Thanks primarily to you,
I'm happy to say...

151
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:45,047
that the first phase
of our operation...

152
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:47,555
has met with considerable success.

153
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:49,818
I have instructed my assistant...

154
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:51,655
to have paid into your...

155
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:53,627
Swiss bank account...

156
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:57,223
the sum of $10 million each.

157
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,461
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, indeed.

158
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:03,130
And that, I think,
concludes our business.

159
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,204
Before you go, however...

160
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,869
I very much regret to inform you...

161
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:10,845
that a dangerous development...

162
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:13,814
has recently been brought
to my notice.

163
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:16,852
Someone has been attempting
to sell the plans...

164
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,217
of our tracking project...

165
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:21,222
to competing world powers.

166
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,782
Someone intimately associated
with the project.

167
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:29,325
My dear, it would be more seemly
if you left us.

168
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,832
Thank you.

169
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:04,060
It was you
who betrayed me.

170
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,897
You had access
to all the information.

171
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:09,961
Now you will pay the penalty.

172
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:38,333
Once again, gentlemen,
my most profound thanks.

173
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:00,739
- Sandor.
- Yes, sir.

174
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,786
Jaws.

175
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:09,490
I'm assigning you the task...

176
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:11,788
of recovering the microfilm copy...

177
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,795
of the tracking system.

178
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:18,658
Sandor, you will go with him.
Obey him.

179
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:23,103
Every person who even comes into contact
with that microfilm...

180
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:25,333
is to be eliminated.

181
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:42,313
Stand by for helicopter takeoff.

182
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:45,758
All personnel,
clear the flight deck platform.

183
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:18,619
Cancel transfer of $20 million.

184
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:22,824
Inform next of kin
that a tragic accident...

185
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:25,731
has resulted in the death
of Professor Markovitz...

186
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:27,792
and Dr. Bechmann.

187
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:32,073
The funeral was at sea.

188
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:33,299
May the peace of Allah
descend upon this magnificent abode...

189
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,301
and allow a poor traveler
to enter.

190
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,803
May the hospitality
of these miserable quarters...

191
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:40,136
be sufficient
to your honored needs.

192
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,539
James Bond, what a delightful surprise
after all these years.

193
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:51,050
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

194
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:58,214
I always wondered what you were gonna do
when you went down from Cambridge.

195
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:01,352
I never had any problems knowing
what you were going to do, Hosein.

196
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,895
We don't only have oil, you know.

197
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:09,231
What can I offer you?
Sheep's eyes? Dates?

198
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:12,363
- Vodka martini?
- Information.

199
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:14,999
Who is putting the submarine
tracking system on the market?

200
00:22:16,644 --> 00:22:19,613
What a pity it is you insist
on being so businesslike.

201
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,054
The gentleman you will
eventually be dealing with...

202
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,854
is a certain Max Kalba.

203
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:35,191
- "Eventually"?
- To reach Kalba...

204
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:38,095
you must first make contact
with a man called Fekkesh.

205
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:41,430
Aziz Fekkesh. I'll give you
his apartment address in Cairo.

206
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:44,437
It's too late to meet him today.

207
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:48,601
Can I persuade you to accept a bed
for the night?

208
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:54,141
That's kind of you, Hosein,
but I really feel I...

209
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:05,322
Are you quite sure I can't persuade you
to stay the night?

210
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,988
When one is in Egypt...

211
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:12,191
one should delve deeply
into its treasures.

212
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:36,507
Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.
The door was open.

213
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,381
Mr. Fekkesh is expecting me.
I phoned him.

214
00:24:39,453 --> 00:24:41,011
He asked me
to give you a message.

215
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,817
He will be late.

216
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,881
May I ask where he is?

217
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:48,587
Mr. Fekkesh asked me to entertain you
while you are waiting.

218
00:24:48,662 --> 00:24:50,095
Really?

219
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:03,336
Where is Fekkesh?

220
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,571
You are very suspicious.

221
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:07,841
I find I live much longer that way.

222
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:09,849
Now where is he?

223
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,257
If there's anything at all
you would like...

224
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:22,591
I had lunch,
but I seem to have missed dessert.

225
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:33,732
As urgent as my appointment is,
I'd hate him to walk in and surprise us.

226
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:36,799
There is no danger of that.

227
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:40,112
He'll be some time then?

228
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,349
Is he meeting someone?

229
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,815
I'm sorry,
I cannot answer that question.

230
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:51,449
Oh, I think you can.

231
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:14,097
Where's Fekkesh?

232
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:17,075
Pyramids.

233
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,948
What a helpful chap.

234
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:33,090
You have come tonight
to the most fabulous...

235
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:35,753
and celebrated place
in the world.

236
00:27:37,296 --> 00:27:42,324
Here on the Plateau of Giza
stands forever...

237
00:27:42,402 --> 00:27:44,427
the mightiest of human achievements.

238
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:50,501
No traveler, emperor,
merchant or poet...

239
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:53,773
has trodden on these sands...

240
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:56,314
and not gasped in awe.

241
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:03,713
The curtain of night
is about to rise...

242
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,884
and disclose the stage on which...

243
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:09,826
the drama of a civilization
took place.

244
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:17,295
Those involved have been present
since the dawn of history...

245
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,033
pitched stubbornly
against sand and wind.

246
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:26,711
And the voice of the desert...

247
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,713
has crossed the centuries.

248
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,851
Excuse me, Major.
I'll be back in a moment.

249
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:57,905
With each new dawn,
I see the sun god rise...

250
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:00,639
on the far bank of the Nile.

251
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:54,930
I am the faithful warden
at the foot of his lord.

252
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,266
So faithful, so vigilant...

253
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:00,930
so near him...

254
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,408
that he gave me his face
for my own.

255
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:10,411
I am a pharaoh's companion...

256
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:15,352
and I am he, the pharaoh.

257
00:30:56,128 --> 00:30:57,686
This is the tomb of Cheops...

258
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:03,832
Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty
4,500 years ago.

259
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,737
Here is the Great Pyramid
which he built...

260
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:11,436
to defend himself against death.

261
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,767
Here in the depths of his tomb...

262
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:40,704
a servant of the king
awaits the call...

263
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:44,470
to set out upon his journey
into eternity.

264
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,303
Death lies waiting.

265
00:32:11,203 --> 00:32:12,636
Where is Fekkesh?

266
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:14,866
With the pharaohs.

267
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:17,842
- You killed him.
- No, he was dead when I found him.

268
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:45,202
Hope you enjoyed the show.

269
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:46,704
Good night.

270
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:28,008
What an unexpected pleasure.
Welcome to the Mujaba Club.

271
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:31,744
Buy you a drink,
Major Amasova?

272
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,752
Or may I call you XXX?

273
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,685
You know who I am.

274
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:38,883
You made quite an impression.

275
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,449
I'm sorry about Ivan and Boris.

276
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:43,325
They exceeded their orders.

277
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,024
Good staff is hard to find these days.

278
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,794
Yes, sir?

279
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:50,563
The lady will have a Bacardi
on the rocks.

280
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:55,540
For the gentleman,
vodka martini, shaken not stirred.

281
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,174
Touche.

282
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,235
Commander James Bond.

283
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:03,805
Recruited to the British Secret Service
from the Royal Navy.

284
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:07,375
Licensed to kill, and has done so
on numerous occasions.

285
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:10,218
Many lady friends,
but married only once.

286
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,885
- Wife killed...
- All right, you've made your point.

287
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:16,952
You're sensitive.

288
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,463
About certain things, yes.

289
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:21,664
Now, if you'll excuse me.

290
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:23,999
Tragically,
I have a previous engagement.

291
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,300
Happily enough, so do I.

292
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:29,501
- Good-bye, Mr. Bond.
- Let's say au revoir.

293
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:33,103
I have the oddest feeling
we'll be meeting again sometime.

294
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:43,588
I'm looking for Mr. Kalba.

295
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:46,386
Mr. Max Kalba is the owner
of the club, sir.

296
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,892
Over there.

297
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:13,743
Mr. Kalba,
my name is James Bond.

298
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,720
What of it?

299
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,781
You had an appointment
with Mr. Fekkesh.

300
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:22,487
- Well?
- He won't be joining you.

301
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:35,574
You have something
I'm interested in buying.

302
00:35:35,642 --> 00:35:38,076
Just a moment.
I would like to bid for it too.

303
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:43,482
You forgot your drink.

304
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:46,184
Thank you.

305
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,481
It seems you have competition,
Mr. Bond.

306
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:52,616
From where I sit...

307
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:57,823
I fancy you will find the lady's figure
hard to match.

308
00:35:57,897 --> 00:36:01,458
Might the contestants be permitted
to view the article for sale?

309
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:15,343
Well, now,
who will start the bidding?

310
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:20,784
Mr. Kalba, sir, the telephone.
An urgent call.

311
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:22,788
Excuse me.

312
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:31,195
Pardon me.

313
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:43,437
This is Kalba. Hello?

314
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,370
Another?

315
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:37,920
We've really got to stop
meeting like this.

316
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,556
Kalba was called to the phone.
What happened?

317
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:47,228
He was cut off, permanently.

318
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,894
Where is the microfilm?

319
00:38:51,137 --> 00:38:52,570
Search me.

320
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,301
He must have it,
or you wouldn't be here.

321
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,808
You don't know who he is.

322
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,970
- He's a professional killer.
- Called Jaws?

323
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,345
Make no mistake, Mr. Bond...

324
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:05,680
I want that microfilm...

325
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:07,845
and I'm going to get it.

326
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,854
Unless I get it first.

327
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,985
Watch out!

328
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:40,829
Don't move.

329
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,503
Give me the microfilm.

330
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:34,819
Egyptian builders.

331
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:07,916
Sorry.
You're just too late.

332
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:10,321
Give me the key!

333
00:44:12,492 --> 00:44:14,221
The key!

334
00:44:23,236 --> 00:44:24,396
Try the big one.

335
00:44:31,311 --> 00:44:33,245
Can you play any other tune?

336
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,241
Let's try reverse.
That's backwards.

337
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,336
Would you like me to drive?

338
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:07,812
Women drivers.

339
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:09,815
Quiet. Watch this.

340
00:45:15,154 --> 00:45:16,815
Shaken, but not stirred.

341
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,349
That gorilla must have his teeth
fixed by a riveter.

342
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:54,518
By the way,
thanks for deserting me back there.

343
00:45:54,594 --> 00:45:56,960
Every woman for herself.
Remember?

344
00:45:58,498 --> 00:46:02,025
Still, you did save my life.

345
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:04,399
We all make mistakes, Mr. Bond.

346
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:40,972
The cylinder head gasket.

347
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,321
What did he say?

348
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,291
He thinks we're overdressed,
but he'll take us to Cairo.

349
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,792
Good.

350
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,782
It's getting cold.

351
00:48:37,856 --> 00:48:40,654
Is there anything I can do
to warm you up?

352
00:48:40,725 --> 00:48:43,922
You don't have to worry about me.

353
00:48:43,995 --> 00:48:46,429
I went on a survival course
in Siberia.

354
00:48:46,498 --> 00:48:51,435
Yes, I believe a great number
of your countrymen do.

355
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:52,970
What did they teach you?

356
00:48:53,038 --> 00:48:57,600
That it's very important
to have a positive mental attitude.

357
00:48:57,676 --> 00:49:00,167
Nothing more practical than that?

358
00:49:00,245 --> 00:49:03,612
Food is also very important.

359
00:49:05,183 --> 00:49:06,616
What else?

360
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:11,213
When necessary,
shared bodily warmth.

361
00:49:13,258 --> 00:49:14,691
That's the part I like.

362
00:49:23,468 --> 00:49:25,561
Is this really what they do
in Siberia?

363
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:29,403
Yes, but not how they do it.

364
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:45,047
You're not trying to take advantage
of me, are you?

365
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:48,719
The thought never crossed my mind.

366
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:59,998
Just when it was getting interesting.

367
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,837
Where's the girl?

368
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,976
- Morning, Moneypenny.
- Good morning, James.

369
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:51,174
Is he in?

370
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:53,581
It must have been quite a party.

371
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,177
Boring.

372
00:51:56,254 --> 00:51:57,744
I dropped off.

373
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:18,734
Hello, James.
We've been expecting you.

374
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,243
Good morning, sir.

375
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:23,712
There's been a change in plan.

376
00:52:23,782 --> 00:52:28,242
You probably recognize my opposite
number in the KGB, General Gogol.

377
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,255
I believe you're familiar
with Major Amasova.

378
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:34,484
Enough to know which brand
of cigarette she smokes.

379
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,186
Our respective governments...

380
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:40,322
agreed to pool their resources to find
out what happened to our submarines.

381
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:43,323
We have entered a new era...

382
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:45,494
of Anglo-Soviet cooperation.

383
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,971
As a sign of Russian good faith...

384
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,008
I'm prepared to make available to you
the microfilm...

385
00:52:51,075 --> 00:52:53,543
recovered by Agent XXX.

386
00:52:53,611 --> 00:52:56,808
With considerable ease,
I might add.

387
00:52:57,715 --> 00:52:59,876
Don't bother. It's useless.

388
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,819
I examined it on the boat.

389
00:53:04,122 --> 00:53:06,352
I assure you it is quite genuine.

390
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:10,554
Except that the vital technical
information has been taken out.

391
00:53:10,628 --> 00:53:12,789
This was only intended
to whet our appetites.

392
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:20,802
Maybe Q can make something
out of it.

393
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,025
I want that ready
for Akmid's tea party.

394
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,951
After you, Alexis.

395
00:53:45,028 --> 00:53:47,258
- After you, Miles.
- Thank you.

396
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,984
That could bring tears
to your eyes.

397
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,721
Everybody ready? Right.

398
00:54:21,264 --> 00:54:24,665
We're pretty certain that this drawing
was drafted in Italy.

399
00:54:24,734 --> 00:54:27,635
The size corresponds
with a Venetian octavo...

400
00:54:27,703 --> 00:54:30,137
and the typeface
is an Italian one.

401
00:54:30,206 --> 00:54:34,506
Now, note the slight upward stress
on the transversals.

402
00:54:34,577 --> 00:54:36,841
What's that mark there?

403
00:54:38,047 --> 00:54:40,311
Probably a show-through
of something...

404
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,476
the drawing was resting on
when it was photographed.

405
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:44,520
Must have been done in a hurry.

406
00:54:44,587 --> 00:54:47,317
- Can you enlarge it?
- Wait a minute.

407
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,690
- "Oratory"? What is that?
- It's another word for chapel.

408
00:54:54,764 --> 00:54:57,824
Looks a bit like a bishop's mitre.

409
00:54:59,268 --> 00:55:01,065
It is a fish.

410
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:03,935
That is the symbol
of the Stromberg Shipping Line.

411
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:06,907
Karl Stromberg? He's one
of the richest men in the world.

412
00:55:06,976 --> 00:55:10,412
One of the principle capitalist
exploiters of the West, sir.

413
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,573
So it's not "oratory,"
it's laboratory.

414
00:55:12,648 --> 00:55:15,378
Stromberg has a marine
research laboratory.

415
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:16,975
On Corsica, I believe.

416
00:55:19,055 --> 00:55:20,488
Well done.

417
00:55:21,357 --> 00:55:23,348
Actually, it is in Sardinia.

418
00:55:28,097 --> 00:55:29,928
That's brilliant.

419
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,866
I'm certain that two such
perceptive talents...

420
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:36,132
will enjoy working together
in Sardinia...

421
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:41,074
and that it will help to make
Anglo-Soviet cooperation a reality.

422
00:55:57,693 --> 00:55:59,126
Here we are.

423
00:56:01,197 --> 00:56:03,665
That was a delicious meal.
Thank you.

424
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:07,300
I didn't realize you had
such a healthy appetite.

425
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,962
Neither did I.

426
00:56:09,038 --> 00:56:12,201
It must be traveling by train.
I always enjoy it.

427
00:56:12,275 --> 00:56:14,835
I remember when...

428
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:16,503
What do you remember?

429
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:19,480
I was going to talk about a mission.

430
00:56:20,716 --> 00:56:22,479
Silly, isn't it?

431
00:56:22,552 --> 00:56:24,679
We can't talk,
and yet we're in the same business.

432
00:56:24,754 --> 00:56:28,690
- But with rival companies.
- We're not rivals at the moment.

433
00:56:30,693 --> 00:56:35,960
Then how about a nightcap,
on the company?

434
00:56:36,032 --> 00:56:37,465
My company.

435
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:41,663
I'm very sorry. I have an idea
tomorrow is going to be a busy day.

436
00:56:41,737 --> 00:56:45,264
- I must sleep.
- Yes.

437
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:48,777
- Well, then, sleep well.
- And you.

438
00:56:50,413 --> 00:56:51,846
Good night.

439
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:42,744
What happened?

440
00:59:42,818 --> 00:59:45,252
He just dropped in
for a quick bite.

441
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,423
You're hurt.

442
00:59:50,326 --> 00:59:51,918
Later.

443
00:59:51,994 --> 00:59:54,588
Let's worry about you.

444
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:59,259
What was it they taught you
on that survival course?

445
00:59:59,335 --> 01:00:01,929
A positive mental attitude.

446
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:05,606
And shared bodily warmth.

447
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:09,443
Nothing about keeping out of drafts?

448
01:00:11,697 --> 01:00:14,291
Still enjoy traveling by train?

449
01:00:18,204 --> 01:00:20,138
You saved my life.

450
01:00:21,507 --> 01:00:22,974
Thank you, James.

451
01:00:23,843 --> 01:00:25,276
I'm sorry.

452
01:00:29,882 --> 01:00:32,407
Why don't you lie down
and let me look at it?

453
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:58,435
What can we use for a bandage?

454
01:01:00,346 --> 01:01:01,779
How about this?

455
01:01:45,157 --> 01:01:46,590
Wait a moment.

456
01:02:06,844 --> 01:02:08,937
- Good morning, Major Boothroyd.
- Good morning, Major.

457
01:02:09,013 --> 01:02:11,948
Look what Q has brought for us.
Isn't it nice?

458
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:18,455
Right.
Now pay attention, 007.

459
01:02:18,523 --> 01:02:22,687
Take great care of this equipment.
There are some special accessories...

460
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,161
- Have I ever let you down?
- Frequently.

461
01:02:59,664 --> 01:03:02,030
You have a reservation for me.
The name is Sterling.

462
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:05,796
Yes. Mr. And Mrs. Sterling.
Booked from Cairo.

463
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:07,303
That's right.

464
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:12,604
We have Suite A-5 for you;
a sitting room and two bedrooms.

465
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:18,639
Moneypenny being over-efficient.
Do you have any messages for me?

466
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:26,455
Thank you.

467
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:32,894
Excellent.
We have been granted an audience.

468
01:03:59,557 --> 01:04:02,151
- Mr. Sterling?
- Yes.

469
01:04:02,226 --> 01:04:06,162
I'm Naomi.
Mr. Stromberg sent me to collect you.

470
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:08,562
How do you do?
This is my wife...

471
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:10,897
who also happens
to be my assistant.

472
01:04:10,968 --> 01:04:13,835
- You are on holiday here?
- Where there's an ocean...

473
01:04:13,904 --> 01:04:16,532
a marine biologist
is never on holiday.

474
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:18,837
Can we offer you a drink
before we go?

475
01:04:18,909 --> 01:04:21,844
No, thank you.
Mr. Stromberg's a very busy man.

476
01:04:21,912 --> 01:04:23,846
His time is precious.

477
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:28,578
What a handsome craft.

478
01:04:28,653 --> 01:04:30,348
Such lovely lines.

479
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:31,012
Thank you.

480
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:33,514
Very impressive.

481
01:05:38,721 --> 01:05:41,656
I wonder if you'd mind
showing my wife around...

482
01:05:41,724 --> 01:05:44,124
- while I'm with Mr. Stromberg.
- Of course.

483
01:05:44,193 --> 01:05:45,956
- This way.
- Thank you.

484
01:05:46,028 --> 01:05:48,690
Don't be a bother
to Naomi, darling.

485
01:05:48,764 --> 01:05:51,028
- I'll be back soon.
- By the way...

486
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,126
Mr. Stromberg prefers
not to shake hands.

487
01:05:54,203 --> 01:05:57,138
- It's the third button.
- Thank you.

488
01:06:29,138 --> 01:06:31,072
Why do we seek
to conquer space...

489
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:36,669
when seven-tenths of our universe
remains to be explored?

490
01:06:36,746 --> 01:06:38,680
The world beneath the sea.

491
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:42,707
You seem to be well-equipped
to repair that oversight.

492
01:06:45,688 --> 01:06:50,489
My name is Robert Sterling.
It's very kind of you to receive me.

493
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,053
It's always a pleasure to welcome
someone with a mutual interest.

494
01:06:57,867 --> 01:06:59,664
An extraordinary number
of rare species.

495
01:07:03,372 --> 01:07:06,307
You recognize that variety,
of course.

496
01:07:11,914 --> 01:07:13,347
Of course.

497
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:18,946
Other fish avoid it.

498
01:07:19,021 --> 01:07:23,355
Those dorsal spines
are laden with venom.

499
01:07:24,326 --> 01:07:25,850
Handsome, but deadly.

500
01:07:27,897 --> 01:07:30,263
I see you know your subject.

501
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:33,501
One tries.

502
01:07:33,569 --> 01:07:36,663
You have a remarkable
establishment here.

503
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:39,833
I'm somewhat of a recluse.

504
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:43,606
I wish to conduct my life
on my own terms...

505
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:48,616
and in surroundings
with which I can identify.

506
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:51,448
That is a privilege of wealth.

507
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,785
Don't you miss the outside world?

508
01:07:55,858 --> 01:07:59,954
For me,
this is all the world.

509
01:08:01,197 --> 01:08:03,131
There's beauty...

510
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:06,125
there's ugliness...

511
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,804
and there is death.

512
01:08:11,373 --> 01:08:14,809
I think you will find
this interesting.

513
01:08:16,579 --> 01:08:18,308
An underwater city.

514
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,473
Fascinating, isn't it?

515
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:23,814
The only hope
for the future of mankind.

516
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:25,319
We all have our dreams.

517
01:08:25,387 --> 01:08:29,824
No dream, Mr. Sterling.
Soon a reality.

518
01:08:31,994 --> 01:08:35,930
I'm afraid you must excuse me.
I have business to attend to.

519
01:08:37,066 --> 01:08:38,499
Good-bye.

520
01:08:38,567 --> 01:08:43,095
If we don't meet again,
I wish you luck with your research.

521
01:08:43,172 --> 01:08:45,936
Thank you. The brief glimpse
you've afforded me today...

522
01:08:46,008 --> 01:08:49,603
will only encourage me
to redouble my efforts.

523
01:08:49,678 --> 01:08:51,111
Good-bye.

524
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:09,793
- How interesting.
- There you are.

525
01:09:09,865 --> 01:09:13,460
Darling, you should look at this model.
It's beautiful.

526
01:09:14,537 --> 01:09:16,129
This is the Liparus...

527
01:09:16,205 --> 01:09:18,537
the latest addition
to the Stromberg fleet.

528
01:09:18,607 --> 01:09:20,472
Launched nine months ago.

529
01:09:20,543 --> 01:09:23,512
At over a million tons,
it's the largest tanker in the world.

530
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:27,481
- After the Karl Marx, of course.
- Really, darling?

531
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:30,986
It's amazing the items of information
you store away.

532
01:09:36,892 --> 01:09:39,588
Were they the two on the train?

533
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,924
James Bond...

534
01:09:43,999 --> 01:09:47,332
and the woman is Major Amasova,
a Russian agent.

535
01:09:49,505 --> 01:09:51,439
Let them get ashore...

536
01:09:54,009 --> 01:09:56,170
and then kill them.

537
01:10:09,692 --> 01:10:12,627
You're being very secretive.
Where are we going?

538
01:10:12,695 --> 01:10:15,459
I want another look
at that Stromberg laboratory.

539
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:18,557
Do you think you could operate
the tracking system from there?

540
01:10:18,634 --> 01:10:20,124
It's possible.

541
01:10:20,202 --> 01:10:23,035
All we know for sure is that
two nuclear submarines are missing.

542
01:10:43,225 --> 01:10:45,318
What did you think
of that tanker model?

543
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:48,420
There was something strange
about the design of her bows.

544
01:10:48,497 --> 01:10:50,055
I've asked M to check her out.

545
01:10:56,872 --> 01:11:00,569
- James, that motorcycle...
- Has been following us for a mile.

546
01:11:55,163 --> 01:11:57,427
All those feathers
and he still can't fly.

547
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,432
Yes, I know. Don't tell me.

548
01:13:22,283 --> 01:13:24,513
You ever get the feeling
somebody doesn't like you?

549
01:14:46,634 --> 01:14:48,534
Can you swim?

550
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:20,732
It's time we said good-bye
to an uninvited guest.

551
01:15:47,695 --> 01:15:49,287
Alone at last.

552
01:16:27,735 --> 01:16:29,669
That's what we've come to see.

553
01:17:40,474 --> 01:17:41,600
Brace yourself.

554
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:51,083
Look!

555
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:37,691
How did you know about that?

556
01:18:37,765 --> 01:18:40,996
I stole the blueprints
of this car two years ago.

557
01:18:43,671 --> 01:18:45,298
Do you think we can make it?

558
01:19:57,009 --> 01:19:58,943
Hello.

559
01:19:59,011 --> 01:20:03,505
- I have a message for you.
- I think you just delivered it.

560
01:20:05,518 --> 01:20:06,951
Thank you.

561
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:23,958
Sorry to interrupt you...

562
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:26,129
but I asked M for a list
of all the ports...

563
01:20:26,205 --> 01:20:28,469
the Stromberg tanker
had called at.

564
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:30,133
What is the answer?

565
01:20:30,209 --> 01:20:32,143
In the nine months
since she was fitted out...

566
01:20:32,211 --> 01:20:35,203
there is no record of her
having put into port anywhere.

567
01:20:36,549 --> 01:20:39,985
That's very odd,
if it's true.

568
01:20:41,053 --> 01:20:43,749
We don't make mistakes
of that sort.

569
01:20:43,823 --> 01:20:46,087
You sound just like a Russian.

570
01:20:48,828 --> 01:20:52,764
I think we should take a closer look
at that tanker, don't you?

571
01:20:52,832 --> 01:20:54,265
Yes, I do.

572
01:20:55,334 --> 01:20:57,097
Shall I contact Gogol?

573
01:20:57,169 --> 01:20:59,433
There's no need.

574
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:04,340
- M has already offered to fix it.
- Very nice.

575
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:07,607
It's Austrian.
I bought it in Berngarten.

576
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:14,710
- I was doing some skiing.
- When was this?

577
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,948
About three weeks ago. Why?

578
01:21:29,368 --> 01:21:31,461
Do you recognize him?

579
01:21:33,572 --> 01:21:35,005
Who is he?

580
01:21:36,876 --> 01:21:39,310
The man I loved.

581
01:21:39,378 --> 01:21:43,109
He was in Berngarten
three weeks ago.

582
01:21:44,183 --> 01:21:46,117
Did you kill him?

583
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,589
When someone's behind you on skis
at 40 miles an hour...

584
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:58,255
trying to put a bullet
in your back...

585
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,924
you don't always
have time to remember a face.

586
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:06,771
In our business,
people get killed.

587
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:10,206
We both know that.
So did he.

588
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:14,475
It was either him or me.

589
01:22:14,546 --> 01:22:18,846
The answer to the question is yes.
I did kill him.

590
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:24,751
Then, when this mission is over...

591
01:22:24,823 --> 01:22:26,256
I will kill you.

592
01:22:53,652 --> 01:22:55,085
Come in.

593
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:01,755
- Commander Carter?
- That's right. Welcome aboard.

594
01:23:01,827 --> 01:23:06,594
Major. Have a seat.
Can I get you something?

595
01:23:06,665 --> 01:23:08,895
Not for me, thank you.
I don't know about the major.

596
01:23:14,173 --> 01:23:16,801
I'm sorry.
I hadn't expected you to be a woman.

597
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:21,312
Aboard this vessel, Commander,
I am Major Amasova of the Russian Army.

598
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:24,679
- Yeah, sure.
- It's good of you to help us out.

599
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,741
Got a couple cabins at your disposal.

600
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:28,286
Thank you.

601
01:23:28,354 --> 01:23:31,551
Major, you're most welcome
to use the shower in my quarters.

602
01:23:31,623 --> 01:23:34,717
You do not have to show me
any special favors, Commander.

603
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:37,762
All the same,
I think it might be better if I did.

604
01:23:45,204 --> 01:23:47,604
From Com Sub Atlantic, sir.

605
01:23:47,673 --> 01:23:49,402
Right.

606
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,707
What's the matter, sailor?

607
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:00,013
You never see a major
taking a shower before?

608
01:24:22,274 --> 01:24:25,141
Stand by for second observation
on target.

609
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:26,643
Up scope.

610
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:32,716
Check.

611
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:41,286
Target bearing. Mark.
Range. Mark.

612
01:24:42,361 --> 01:24:44,420
Down scope.

613
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:48,159
- One division in high power.
- Range 6,200 yards, sir.

614
01:24:48,233 --> 01:24:50,167
Angle on the bow, port 50.

615
01:24:50,235 --> 01:24:52,567
Control, Torpedo Room.
Boarding party ready, sir.

616
01:24:58,143 --> 01:25:03,080
Captain, sir, our best solution for
the target is 120. Speed three knots.

617
01:25:03,148 --> 01:25:06,549
Officer of the deck, come right north.
Maneuvering, make turns for 11 knots.

618
01:25:06,618 --> 01:25:08,108
Officer of the deck, aye, sir.

619
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:12,453
Which bullet has my name on it?
The first or the last?

620
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:16,858
I have never failed on a mission,
Commander. Any mission.

621
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,897
In that case, Major...

622
01:25:19,965 --> 01:25:23,025
one of us is bound
to end up gravely disappointed...

623
01:25:23,102 --> 01:25:24,535
because neither of the...

624
01:25:27,573 --> 01:25:30,133
Control, Maneuvering.
We're losing electrical frequency.

625
01:25:31,577 --> 01:25:34,307
Control, Sonar. Total power
supplies failure on all sets.

626
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,837
- Surface!
- Blow forward! Blow aft!

627
01:25:55,033 --> 01:25:57,058
Up scope. Stand by.

628
01:26:02,975 --> 01:26:04,909
Where the hell is she?

629
01:26:07,146 --> 01:26:08,579
She's right behind us.

630
01:26:14,553 --> 01:26:15,986
Impossible.

631
01:27:20,483 --> 01:27:22,815
Stand by on number two dock.

632
01:27:25,621 --> 01:27:27,714
Liparus crew, take up positions.

633
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:33,989
Dock Officer to Operations.

634
01:27:34,063 --> 01:27:36,691
Mobilization crew
entering dock area.

635
01:27:40,236 --> 01:27:42,101
Number two dock to Operations.

636
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:44,537
Twenty-five meters to run.
I say again.

637
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:54,438
Operation Room to number two dock.
Docking now complete.

638
01:27:54,517 --> 01:27:57,384
Disembarkation crew
moving into position.

639
01:28:09,031 --> 01:28:12,967
S Ray program completed.
Magnetic field shut down.

640
01:28:13,035 --> 01:28:15,196
All systems normal.

641
01:28:15,271 --> 01:28:17,739
Limpet speaker
in position, sir.

642
01:28:17,807 --> 01:28:21,675
Commander,
you have precisely two minutes...

643
01:28:21,744 --> 01:28:24,975
to open your hatches
and surrender your ship.

644
01:28:25,047 --> 01:28:30,178
The alternative is extermination
by cyanide gas.

645
01:28:31,721 --> 01:28:34,019
Well?

646
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:36,024
There's no alternative.

647
01:28:39,729 --> 01:28:42,823
Now hear this.
Your Captain speaking.

648
01:28:42,898 --> 01:28:45,594
Open all hatches and proceed quietly
onto the casing.

649
01:28:55,711 --> 01:28:58,942
Hurry, Commander.
I'm not renown for my patience.

650
01:29:02,485 --> 01:29:04,419
Okay, two ranks.
Move it out.

651
01:29:07,957 --> 01:29:09,925
Stay close to me.
We'll try and hide you.

652
01:29:11,127 --> 01:29:14,096
Our time is limited, Captain.

653
01:29:14,163 --> 01:29:16,791
- Commence operations forthwith.
- Yes, sir.

654
01:29:19,368 --> 01:29:21,836
Attention all personnel.

655
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:24,429
Stromberg crews One and Two...

656
01:29:24,507 --> 01:29:26,441
embark your submarines.

657
01:29:40,523 --> 01:29:43,287
Put the Americans in
with the others, Captain.

658
01:29:44,894 --> 01:29:46,327
Remove the prisoners.

659
01:29:54,403 --> 01:29:56,337
Don't look up.
You're on Candid Camera.

660
01:29:59,842 --> 01:30:01,776
Complete nuclear missile loading.

661
01:30:35,211 --> 01:30:38,442
Operations, Radar.
No contacts within 25,000 meters.

662
01:30:38,514 --> 01:30:40,505
Bring those two prisoners here.

663
01:31:04,306 --> 01:31:06,866
Let's go. Come on now.

664
01:31:06,942 --> 01:31:08,705
Operations Room, Sonar.

665
01:31:08,778 --> 01:31:10,678
No contacts, no transmissions.

666
01:31:10,746 --> 01:31:12,680
Cease stable hold.

667
01:31:16,485 --> 01:31:19,010
You have certainly been persistent.

668
01:31:19,088 --> 01:31:23,525
Very well.
Now your curiosity can be satisfied.

669
01:31:23,592 --> 01:31:25,287
Both crews aboard, sir.

670
01:31:25,361 --> 01:31:27,022
Missile onload completed.

671
01:31:27,096 --> 01:31:29,826
They have already
been given their targets.

672
01:31:29,899 --> 01:31:33,494
At 12:00 noon, they will have
reached firing positions.

673
01:31:33,569 --> 01:31:37,972
Within minutes,
New York and Moscow...

674
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,974
will cease to exist.

675
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:42,909
Global destruction will follow.

676
01:31:44,046 --> 01:31:46,640
The new era will begin.

677
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:49,582
Submarines One and Two...

678
01:31:49,652 --> 01:31:52,712
commence departure drill.

679
01:31:52,788 --> 01:31:55,780
All right, you've made your point.

680
01:31:55,858 --> 01:31:57,382
How much do you want?

681
01:31:57,459 --> 01:31:59,893
"How much?"

682
01:31:59,962 --> 01:32:01,987
Whatever do you mean, Mr. Bond?

683
01:32:02,064 --> 01:32:05,124
The price for not firing
those nuclear missiles.

684
01:32:06,602 --> 01:32:09,264
You're deluded, Mr. Bond.

685
01:32:09,338 --> 01:32:12,068
I'm not interested in extortion.

686
01:32:12,141 --> 01:32:14,666
I intend to change the face
of history.

687
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:16,506
By destroying the world?

688
01:32:16,579 --> 01:32:19,207
By creating a world.

689
01:32:19,281 --> 01:32:22,375
A new and beautiful world
beneath the sea.

690
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:26,854
Today, civilization as we know it
is corrupt and decadent.

691
01:32:26,922 --> 01:32:29,584
Inevitably, it will destroy itself.

692
01:32:29,658 --> 01:32:33,594
I'm merely accelerating the process.

693
01:32:33,662 --> 01:32:36,631
That does not justify mass murder.

694
01:32:36,699 --> 01:32:38,792
For that, Major...

695
01:32:38,868 --> 01:32:41,837
I will accept the judgment
of posterity.

696
01:32:43,038 --> 01:32:45,233
Submarines ready for departure, sir.

697
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:49,300
Open bow doors, Captain.

698
01:32:54,516 --> 01:32:56,450
Stromberg One...

699
01:32:56,518 --> 01:32:59,612
you are clear
to proceed to sea.

700
01:33:05,127 --> 01:33:09,894
Stromberg Two, you are also clear
to proceed to sea. Forward stern.

701
01:33:15,104 --> 01:33:18,972
Observe, Mr. Bond,
the instruments of Armageddon.

702
01:33:50,673 --> 01:33:53,437
Put this man
with the rest of the prisoners.

703
01:33:55,077 --> 01:33:58,638
The lady will be traveling to Atlantis
with me.

704
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:09,724
Farewell, Mr. Bond.

705
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:12,022
That word has, I must admit...

706
01:34:12,094 --> 01:34:15,495
a welcome ring of permanency
about it.

707
01:34:17,099 --> 01:34:18,862
Au revoir, Anya.

708
01:34:19,969 --> 01:34:21,402
Bring her.

709
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:07,074
Get that man!

710
01:35:14,123 --> 01:35:16,114
Keep going.

711
01:35:31,807 --> 01:35:33,365
Call him over.

712
01:35:49,591 --> 01:35:52,321
- Where's your captain?
- Here.

713
01:35:52,394 --> 01:35:54,191
Release the other crews,
then make for the armory.

714
01:35:54,263 --> 01:35:55,787
Follow me, men.
At the double.

715
01:36:04,073 --> 01:36:05,506
Come on. Let's go.

716
01:36:13,015 --> 01:36:14,812
Seal the operations room!

717
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:28,294
You! Stand by over there!

718
01:36:37,907 --> 01:36:39,738
Help yourself to firearms!

719
01:36:44,413 --> 01:36:46,438
Grab a weapon.
Come on, let's go.

720
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:45,467
We've taken both sides of the lower dock
area, but your captain's dead.

721
01:38:45,534 --> 01:38:47,502
We're still no closer
to that control room.

722
01:38:49,171 --> 01:38:51,105
Leave it to me, sir.

723
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:57,645
Andrews, James, Marchal, Purvis.
Follow me.

724
01:39:27,843 --> 01:39:30,403
That armored plating
must be inches thick.

725
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:32,709
- We'll never get through it.
- Let's get to the armory.

726
01:39:32,781 --> 01:39:34,942
- What do you reckon to find there?
- A nuclear missile.

727
01:39:35,017 --> 01:39:37,110
A nuc... Hey, wait!

728
01:39:50,732 --> 01:39:52,825
This could take hours, sir.

729
01:39:52,901 --> 01:39:54,892
You got a date?

730
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:56,528
No, sir.

731
01:40:00,976 --> 01:40:03,001
Now you are beautiful.

732
01:40:03,078 --> 01:40:06,411
I'm sorry if you feel
less than comfortable...

733
01:40:06,482 --> 01:40:10,942
but you have a tendency to violence
that must be controlled.

734
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:18,026
- What is it?
- I have to report, sir...

735
01:40:18,093 --> 01:40:20,493
a breakout by some
of the prisoners.

736
01:40:20,562 --> 01:40:22,530
That is unfortunate, Captain.

737
01:40:22,598 --> 01:40:25,692
However, sir, we now
have the situation under control.

738
01:40:25,767 --> 01:40:28,895
The operations room
is quite impregnable.

739
01:40:28,971 --> 01:40:34,170
Then we must hope, Captain,
that you will suffer no further mishap.

740
01:40:45,154 --> 01:40:47,179
All I need out of here
is the detonator.

741
01:41:06,141 --> 01:41:08,666
James, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

742
01:41:10,078 --> 01:41:12,012
There has to be a first time
for everything.

743
01:41:19,021 --> 01:41:20,545
Blast.

744
01:41:21,857 --> 01:41:23,791
What's the problem?

745
01:41:23,859 --> 01:41:26,327
I mustn't touch any part
of the impulse conductor circuit.

746
01:41:27,763 --> 01:41:30,323
This ring houses the impulse conductor
circuit, sir.

747
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:35,166
It's magnetic. I mustn't touch it
with any part of the detonator.

748
01:41:35,237 --> 01:41:38,832
- What happens if you do?
- It'll go off.

749
01:42:18,213 --> 01:42:20,704
- Get me a number six detonator.
- Aye, aye, sir.

750
01:42:24,286 --> 01:42:27,346
- Number six, sir.
- Thank you.

751
01:42:27,422 --> 01:42:29,447
Did you fix that 20-second fuse?

752
01:42:29,524 --> 01:42:30,957
Yes, sir. Here it is.

753
01:42:32,294 --> 01:42:35,525
Plastic explosive.

754
01:42:49,544 --> 01:42:51,512
Is everything proceeding
according to plan?

755
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:54,378
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.

756
01:44:21,136 --> 01:44:22,797
- Sir?
- What is it?

757
01:44:22,871 --> 01:44:25,169
The monitors faded.

758
01:44:48,897 --> 01:44:49,921
Change the circuit.

759
01:45:21,129 --> 01:45:22,596
Cease fire!

760
01:45:24,599 --> 01:45:26,965
You're too late, Bond.

761
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:30,061
Our submarines are already on station.

762
01:45:30,138 --> 01:45:33,869
In four minutes,
the missiles will be launched.

763
01:45:38,713 --> 01:45:40,840
Can you work
the printout transmission unit?

764
01:45:40,916 --> 01:45:42,941
Sure,
but we've only got three minutes.

765
01:45:43,018 --> 01:45:47,114
If we can work out the position of those
submarines, maybe we can reprogram them.

766
01:45:47,189 --> 01:45:49,123
- To do what?
- To destroy each other.

767
01:46:28,661 --> 01:46:30,424
James! The globe!

768
01:46:36,102 --> 01:46:41,096
Pass the position of the first submarine
to the second as their target.

769
01:46:41,173 --> 01:46:43,198
- And vice versa?
- Exactly.

770
01:47:08,567 --> 01:47:12,333
Missile Control, this is the Captain.
We have a change of target.

771
01:47:12,404 --> 01:47:17,364
New coordinates are 034285219.

772
01:47:33,926 --> 01:47:37,225
Missile Control, Captain.
We have a new target.

773
01:48:57,243 --> 01:49:00,440
Everybody back on board the submarine!
Pass it on!

774
01:49:00,512 --> 01:49:01,979
Come on! Let's go!

775
01:49:12,725 --> 01:49:15,922
Foster, get those lines cleared!
Come on!

776
01:49:15,995 --> 01:49:17,428
Leaver, throw those guys a line!

777
01:49:18,731 --> 01:49:21,461
Get those block fenders cleared!
Fore and aft!

778
01:49:21,533 --> 01:49:23,728
Get the submarine
at diving stations!

779
01:49:33,379 --> 01:49:36,007
Control, Maneuvering.
Reactor at half-power state.

780
01:49:36,081 --> 01:49:37,514
Ready to check telegraphs.

781
01:49:37,583 --> 01:49:40,677
All personnel,
take up positions fast!

782
01:49:40,753 --> 01:49:42,846
- Get Roberts in the gyro unit.
- Right.

783
01:49:42,921 --> 01:49:44,513
Come on! Move it!

784
01:49:51,864 --> 01:49:53,957
Stand by to revert
to normal lighting.

785
01:49:54,033 --> 01:49:56,627
Come on, sailor.
Get that hatch shut quick.

786
01:49:59,872 --> 01:50:01,464
- Torpedo Room, Control.
- Torpedo Room.

787
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:03,974
Load tube one
with mark 46 torpedo.

788
01:50:13,252 --> 01:50:15,049
Open outer door on tube one.

789
01:50:16,889 --> 01:50:18,880
Select zero gyro angle.

790
01:50:20,626 --> 01:50:22,491
Outer door on tube one open.

791
01:50:22,561 --> 01:50:24,051
Match bearings and shoot.

792
01:50:24,129 --> 01:50:26,290
- Set.
- Shoot.

793
01:50:29,134 --> 01:50:30,897
Torpedo running.

794
01:50:50,289 --> 01:50:53,019
Rudder amidships.
Ahead two-thirds.

795
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:04,496
Left seven degrees rudder.

796
01:52:38,664 --> 01:52:40,097
How far would you say?

797
01:52:42,401 --> 01:52:46,132
- About 10,000 yards, sir.
- Commander.

798
01:52:55,013 --> 01:52:56,446
Close it.

799
01:53:00,185 --> 01:53:02,449
I just got this signal
from the Pentagon.

800
01:53:02,521 --> 01:53:04,785
On instructions
from the Security Council:

801
01:53:04,857 --> 01:53:06,950
"Destroy Atlantis fast. "

802
01:53:07,025 --> 01:53:08,458
What does "fast" mean?

803
01:53:08,527 --> 01:53:10,791
Battle stations five minutes.

804
01:53:11,864 --> 01:53:13,957
With torpedoes?

805
01:53:14,032 --> 01:53:15,795
Yes.

806
01:53:15,868 --> 01:53:18,132
He has Anya on there.

807
01:53:18,203 --> 01:53:20,637
- I know. I'm sorry.
- I have to get her off.

808
01:53:20,706 --> 01:53:23,800
- How?
- Can I have the equipment Q sent?

809
01:53:23,876 --> 01:53:25,309
Sure.

810
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:31,316
Barton. That package
for Commander Bond, bring it in quick.

811
01:53:34,052 --> 01:53:36,452
- I need an hour.
- That comes from the top!

812
01:53:36,522 --> 01:53:37,955
Forty minutes!

813
01:53:39,024 --> 01:53:40,992
You're gonna get me court-martialed.

814
01:53:43,562 --> 01:53:44,995
One hour.

815
01:53:46,231 --> 01:53:47,664
Come in.

816
01:53:51,069 --> 01:53:52,764
I'll give you a hand.

817
01:54:44,222 --> 01:54:47,817
Good evening, Mr. Bond.
I've been expecting you.

818
01:54:47,892 --> 01:54:52,420
Stay where you are.
I'll send the elevator down for you.

819
01:55:06,210 --> 01:55:08,201
Good-bye, Mr. Bond.

820
01:55:19,857 --> 01:55:21,950
You did want me to drop in.

821
01:55:33,037 --> 01:55:36,905
- Where's Anya?
- Well, well, well.

822
01:55:36,975 --> 01:55:41,139
A British agent
in love with a Russian agent.

823
01:55:41,212 --> 01:55:42,873
Detente, indeed.

824
01:55:46,384 --> 01:55:48,784
Sit down, Mr. Bond.

825
01:55:54,225 --> 01:55:57,956
- Your time is running out.
- Yours too, Mr. Bond.

826
01:55:59,731 --> 01:56:02,165
And faster than you think.

827
01:56:11,743 --> 01:56:15,144
You shot your bolt.
Now it's my turn.

828
01:58:21,806 --> 01:58:23,637
How does that grab you?

829
01:59:12,056 --> 01:59:15,150
We're five minutes overdue, Captain.

830
01:59:23,734 --> 01:59:25,827
- Stromberg?
- Dead.

831
01:59:25,903 --> 01:59:27,894
So are we
unless we get out of here fast.

832
01:59:27,972 --> 01:59:29,496
Match bearings and shoot.

833
02:01:44,408 --> 02:01:46,501
Maybe I misjudged Stromberg.

834
02:01:46,577 --> 02:01:50,343
Any man who drinks Dom Perignon '52
can't be all bad.

835
02:01:54,518 --> 02:01:57,112
The mission is over, Commander.

836
02:02:12,036 --> 02:02:16,097
In my country, the condemned man
is usually allowed a final request.

837
02:02:16,173 --> 02:02:17,538
Granted.

838
02:02:21,212 --> 02:02:23,840
Let's get out of these wet things.

839
02:02:47,238 --> 02:02:51,971
But, James,
what would our superiors say?

840
02:02:52,043 --> 02:02:53,476
They'll never know.

841
02:02:59,350 --> 02:03:01,284
Lower the stern gate.

842
02:03:01,352 --> 02:03:04,344
- Is there danger of the bends?
- We'll soon find out.

843
02:03:32,683 --> 02:03:35,516
- 007.
- XXX.

844
02:03:35,586 --> 02:03:37,019
What are you doing?

845
02:03:40,057 --> 02:03:42,321
Keeping the British end up, sir.
