1
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,700
The assistant warden wants this one
out of the block early.

2
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,700
Wants to get it over with fast.

3
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,900
Okay. Let's do it.

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,300
Hey, wake up. It's time.

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,800
Wake up. Let's go. It's time.

6
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,800
This is it.

7
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,700
7474505B.

8
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,600
- What wing?
- Maximum wing, Block 9.

9
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,700
Standard release?

10
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,100
Parole, three out of five.
Good behavior.

11
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,700
Give me a minute.

12
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,200
One Timex digital watch, broken.

13
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
One unused prophylactic.

14
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
One soiled.

15
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,700
Boots, black.
Belt, black.

16
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,400
One black suit jacket.

17
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,100
One pair black suit pants.

18
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,900
One hat.

19
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
Black.

20
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,300
One pair sunglasses.

21
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
Twenty-three dollars
and seven cents.

22
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,700
Sign here.

23
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,100
- What's this?
- What?

24
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,700
This car.

25
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,600
This stupid car.

26
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,700
Where's the Cadillac?

27
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,800
The Caddy.
Where's the Caddy?

28
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,500
The what?

29
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,100
The Cadillac we used to have.
The Bluesmobile.

30
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,500
I traded it.

31
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,200
- You traded the Bluesmobile for this?
- No, for a microphone.

32
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,600
A microphone?

33
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,300
Okay, I can see that.

34
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,500
- What the hell is this?
- This was a bargain.

35
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,700
I picked it up at the Mount Prospect
City Police Auction last spring.

36
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,500
It's an old Mount Prospect police car.
They were practically giving them away.

37
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, thank you, pal.

38
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
The day I get out of prison...

39
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,000
my own brother picks me up
in a police car.

40
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,200
You don't like it?

41
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
No, I don't like it.

42
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,500
Car's got a lot of pick-up.

43
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,500
It's got a cop motor,
a 440-cubic-inch plant.

44
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,100
It's got cop tyres,
cop suspension, cop shocks.

45
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
A model made
before catalytic converters...

46
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,700
so it'll run good on regular gas.

47
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,100
What do you say?
Is it the new Bluesmobile, or what?

48
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,700
Fix the cigarette lighter.

49
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,900
What are we doing here?

50
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,200
You promised you'd visit
the Penguin the day you got out.

51
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Yeah. So I lied to her.

52
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
You can't lie to a nun.

53
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,200
We gotta go in
and visit the Penguin.

54
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,400
No fucking way.

55
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,600
Who is it?

56
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
Jake and Elwood.

57
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
Come in.

58
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,700
Hello, boys.

59
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,100
Nice to see you.

60
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Please, have a seat.

61
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,500
No, boys.

62
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Come over here in front of me.

63
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,500
I want to see your faces.

64
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,300
The county took a tax assessment
of this property last month.

65
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,200
They want $5,000.

66
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Won't the church pay?

67
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
They would if they were
interested in keeping the place.

68
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,800
But they aren't.

69
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,900
The archbishop wants to sell this
building to the Board of Education.

70
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,700
What will happen to you?

71
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,300
I'll be sent to the missions--

72
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Africa, Latin America...

73
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,200
- Korea.
- Forget it!

74
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Five grand? No problem. We'll have it
for you in the morning. Let's go.

75
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,300
I will not take
your filthy, stolen money!

76
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,600
Well, then.
I guess you're really up shit creek.

77
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

78
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,700
I offered to help you.

79
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,900
You refused to take our money.

80
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Then I said,
''I guess you're really up shit creek.''

81
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,900
- Christ, Jake, take it easy, man.
- Elwood!

82
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
- Ow! Shit!
-Jesus Christ!

83
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,600
- Shit!
-Jesus!

84
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,900
- Shit! Goddam it!
- Son of a bitch!

85
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
You fat penguin!

86
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,500
Fuck this!

87
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,600
You are
such a disappointing pair.

88
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,600
I prayed so hard for you.

89
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,600
It saddens and hurts me...

90
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,000
that the two young men
whom I raised...

91
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,200
to believe
in the Ten Commandments...

92
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,200
have returned to me
as two thieves...

93
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,900
with filthy mouths
and bad attitudes.

94
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,900
Get out!

95
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,400
And don't come back...

96
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,500
until you've
redeemed yourselves.

97
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,400
Boys, you gotta learn
not to talk to nuns that way.

98
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,300
Curtis!

99
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,900
- You look fine!
- Good to see you!

100
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Buy you boys a drink?

101
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,400
Boys, things are bad.

102
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,400
They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Education...

103
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,400
and I'll be out on the street.

104
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,000
That money's got to be in the Cook
County Assessor's Office within 11 days.

105
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,700
They wouldn't turn you out,
would they?

106
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,500
Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?

107
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,500
Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.

108
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,500
You're the only one
that was ever good to us...

109
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,000
singing Elmore James tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.

110
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,800
Well, the sister was right. You boys
could use a little churching up.

111
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,600
Slide on down
to the Triple Rock...

112
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,000
and catch Reverend Cleophus.

113
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,900
You boys listen
to what he's got to say.

114
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't want to listen
to no jive-ass preacher...

115
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,400
talking to me
about heaven and hell.

116
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,500
You get wise.
You get to church!

117
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,200
All I'm saying is,
we got to figure out...

118
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,700
some way
to get that money honestly.

119
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,700
That could be a problem.

120
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,100
Like the Penguin says.

121
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,700
We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church.

122
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,200
''We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church.''

123
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,600
Bullshit.

124
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,700
Come on.

125
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
And now, this week's sermon...

126
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,300
is from our beloved,
the Reverend Cleophus James!

127
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,000
And now, people--

128
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,100
And now, people--

129
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,400
When I woke up this morning,
I heard a disturbing sound.

130
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,200
I said,
when I woke up this morning...

131
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,600
I heard a disturbing sound!

132
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,300
What I heard
was the jingle-jangle...

133
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,300
of a thousand lost souls!

134
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and women...

135
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,800
departed from this life!

136
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,800
Wait a minute!

137
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,300
Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth...

138
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
seeking a divine light...

139
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,400
they'll not find
because it's too late!

140
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Too late! Yeah! Too late
for them to ever see again...

141
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,600
the light they once chose
not to follow! All right!

142
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Don't be lost
when the time comes!

143
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,300
For the day of the Lord cometh...

144
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,000
as a thief in the night!

145
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,900
Amen

146
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,700
Say amen!

147
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
- Let us all
- All go back

148
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,500
- To the old
- Old landmark

149
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
As we stay
in the service of the Lord

150
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,500
- Let us preach
- Preach the word

151
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,900
- Got to preach
- Preach the word all the way

152
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Do it, know it, feel it

153
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
Jake, are you all right?

154
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,200
Alleluia

155
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,500
The band.

156
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,000
Do you see the light?

157
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,400
What light?

158
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,400
Have you seen the light?

159
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,600
Yes!
Jesus H. Tap-Dancing Christ!

160
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,500
I have seen the light!

161
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,100
The band!

162
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,600
- Praise God!
- And God bless the United States!

163
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,100
Stay in the service
of the Lord

164
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Yea, Lord

165
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,300
We'll put the band back together,
we do a few gigs...

166
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,500
we get some bread.
Bang-- five thousand bucks!

167
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,900
Well, getting the band
back together might not be that easy.

168
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,800
- What are you talking about?
- They split.

169
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
They all took straight jobs.

170
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,100
Yeah? So you know
where they are.

171
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
You said you were
keeping in touch with them.

172
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,800
I got a couple of leads,
a few phone numbers.

173
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,800
But, I mean, how many of them
visited or even wrote you?

174
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,100
They're not the kind of guys
who write letters.

175
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,900
You were outside.
I was inside.

176
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,200
You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.

177
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,100
I kept asking you
if we were gonna play again.

178
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,900
What was I gonna do,
take away your only hope?

179
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,900
Take away the very thing
that kept you going in there?

180
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,700
I took the liberty
of bullshitting you. Okay?

181
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,300
- You lied to me.
- It wasn't lies. It was just bullshit.

182
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,500
- Shit.
- What?

183
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,500
- Rollers.
- No.

184
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,100
Shit.

185
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,700
- What? What did I do?
- You failed to stop at a red signal.

186
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,000
The light was yellow, sir.

187
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,400
May I see your license, please?

188
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,200
Goddam it!

189
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,700
I haven't been pulled over
in six months.

190
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
I bet those cops
have got SCMODS.

191
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,000
State County Municipal Offender
Data System.

192
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,900
Elwood, we show your license
currently under suspension.

193
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,300
Step out of the car, please.

194
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,800
First you trade the Cadillac
for a microphone.

195
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,000
Then you lie to me
about the band.

196
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,300
Now you're gonna put me
right back in the joint!

197
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,100
They're not gonna catch us.
We're on a mission from God.

198
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,400
We are in high-speed pursuit
northbound on Courtland Avenue.

199
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,800
Black-and-white 1974 Dodge sedan
with Illinois plates.

200
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,000
Request assistance.

201
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,000
We'll be all right if we can
just get back on the express way.

202
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
This don't look
like no express way to me!

203
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,800
Don't yell at me.

204
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,100
What do you want me to do,
motor head?

205
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,100
Try not to be so negative
all the time.

206
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,100
Why don't you offer
some constructive criticism?

207
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,500
You got us into this parking lot, pal.
Now you get us out!

208
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,300
You want out
of this parking lot?

209
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,900
- Will there be anything else?
- Do you have Miss Piggy?

210
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,800
- There's pants and burgers.
- Yeah, lots of space in this mall.

211
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,300
Disco pants and haircuts.

212
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,400
Baby clothes.

213
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,600
This place has got everything.

214
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,800
New Oldsmobiles
are in early this year.

215
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,300
Pier 1 Imports.

216
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,800
Oh, shit!

217
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,200
They broke my watch!

218
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,800
I'm gonna catch that sucker...

219
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,600
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

220
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
Nice place, huh?

221
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,800
Hey, Sam.

222
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,600
Hey, Lloyd.

223
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,800
- Anybody call for me on the phone?
- No. No calls.

224
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,300
Some guy left his card.
Cop. Said he'd be back.

225
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,800
This here's my brother, Jake.
He just got out of the joint.

226
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,800
He's gonna be staying with me
for a few weeks.

227
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,500
Yeah. Okay.

228
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
Did you get me
my Cheez Whiz, boy?

229
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,000
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.

230
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,800
- How often does the train go by?
- So often you won't even notice it.

231
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
What are you doing?

232
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,800
Making dinner.
Want some?

233
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,900
Tomorrow we got to get
the band back together.

234
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,700
I'm gonna quit work
in the morning, first thing.

235
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,900
And how are you going
to get to work...

236
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,100
Mr Lead Foot, Mr Hot-Rodder,
Mr Motor Head?

237
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,500
Those cops took your license away.

238
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
They got your name,
your address.

239
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,300
No, they don't got my address.
I falsified my renewal.

240
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,900
I put down 1060 West Addison.

241
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,000
That's Wrigley Field.

242
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,500
I gotta hit the sack.

243
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,400
Hey, you sleaze! My bed!

244
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,800
This, gentlemen, is the elegant
abode of one Elwood Blues.

245
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,600
Thanks, Mr Mercer.

246
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,100
- I kinda like the Wrigley Field bit.
- Yeah, real cute.

247
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,000
Hi, Sam.

248
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,700
Hi. Has my friend arrived yet?
He failed to report in yesterday.

249
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,200
I don't want trouble.

250
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,700
Tell us where they are,
and there'll be no trouble.

251
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,300
Stand back.

252
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's almost 9:00.
We've gotta go to work.

253
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,400
Hello, Elwood. Sit down.
What's on your mind?

254
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,600
I gotta quit.

255
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,000
Why is that, Elwood?

256
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,100
I'm going to become a priest.

257
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'll call payroll and have them get
your severance pay ready.

258
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,900
- Good luck.
- God bless you, sir.

259
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,200
thank you.

260
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,600
- What's this?
- This is the last known address...

261
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,300
of Bones Malone
and Blue Lou Marini.

262
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,100
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

263
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,700
- Mrs Toronto?
- Tarantino.

264
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,200
Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone
or Louis Marini living here?

265
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,400
Not any more.
They moved out a long time ago.

266
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,800
I don't take in boarders any more.

267
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,500
- May we come in, ma'am?
- Please.

268
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,200
Did they leave a forwarding address?
A phone number?

269
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,000
Did they live quietly?
What were their personal habits?

270
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,200
They were good boys...

271
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,500
but they made
a lot of racket at night.

272
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,400
Are you the police?

273
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,700
No, ma'am.
We're musicians.

274
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,200
Mr Man!

275
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,200
- Yes, ma'am?
- They left this card. Maybe it'll help.

276
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,600
Thanks.

277
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,000
thank you. You're marvelous.

278
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,200
thank you. I'm Murph,
and these are the Magic Tones.

279
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,500
Steve ''The Colonel'' Cropper,
Donald ''Duck'' Dunn...

280
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Willie ''Too Big'' Hall
and Tom ''Bones'' Malone.

281
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,700
We'll be back with the Magic Tones
for the Armada Room's...

282
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,100
two-hour disco swing party
after this short break.

283
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,400
Till then, don't you go changing.

284
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,700
So you're out. You're free.
You're rehabilitated.

285
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,700
What's next? What's happening?
What you gonna do?

286
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,900
You got the money you owe us,
mother-fucker?

287
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
Let's get something
straight here.

288
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,800
The reason he got locked in the slam
in the first place...

289
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,700
was for sticking up a gas station
to cover you guys.

290
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,400
You're kidding.

291
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,200
He pulled that job to pay
for the band's room-service tab...

292
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,800
from that Kiwanis gig
in Coal City.

293
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,700
- You did?
- That's right.

294
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,000
So I don't want to hear
any more of this small-change shit.

295
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,900
We're putting the band
back together.

296
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,600
Who here at this table
can honestly say...

297
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,700
that they played any finer
or felt any better than they did...

298
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,700
when they were
with the Blues Brothers?

299
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,700
You were the backbone...

300
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,400
the nerve centre
of a great rhythm-and-blues band.

301
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,500
You can make that live,
breathe and jump again.

302
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Murph and the Magic Tones?

303
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,900
Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.

304
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,500
And I thought
I had it bad in Joliet.

305
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,700
At least we got
a change in clothes.

306
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,300
You're wearing the same shit
from three years ago.

307
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,300
Jake ain't lying, though.

308
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,600
We had a band powerful enough
to turn goat piss into gasoline.

309
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,800
We'll never get that fat sound again
without more horns.

310
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,700
We'll never get Mr Fabulous.

311
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,800
- Where is he?
- Forget it.

312
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,200
Mr Fabulous is the top maitre d'
at the Chez Paul.

313
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,300
He's pullin' down
six bills a week.

314
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,700
- Matt Murphy got married.
- Where is Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy?

315
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,700
He opened a restaurant with his old lady
on Maxwell Street...

316
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
and he took Blue Lou with him.

317
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,500
You'll never get Matt and Mr Fabulous
out of them high-paying gigs.

318
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,200
Oh, yeah?

319
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,700
Well, me and the Lord...

320
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,100
we got an understanding.

321
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,200
We're on a mission from God.

322
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,800
Mainly French cuisine.

323
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,600
No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer
dines here. He's dead, sir.

324
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,300
Private dining rooms
are available.

325
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,700
Oh, no. It was supposed to be
five years.

326
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,600
Didn't you get five years?
No, sir, not you.

327
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,500
And your name, sir?

328
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,600
Rizzolo, for eight at 11:30.
thank you.

329
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,900
Mr Fabulous,
how marvelous it is to see you.

330
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,800
- You're looking younger than ever.
- Wait. You guys can't come in here.

331
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Nonsense, my dear fellow.

332
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,900
My brother and I
have come to dine...

333
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,700
to celebrate my early release
from the service of the state.

334
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,500
Wait. Let's talk outside.

335
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,500
- Let's have a cup of coffee outside.
- Why, heavens, no.

336
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,600
We seek a full meal and all
the compliments of the house.

337
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,500
Come, Elwood.

338
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,900
Let us adjourn ourselves
to the nearest table...

339
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,300
and overlook this establishment's
board offare.

340
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,300
Good evening. Chez Paul.
Wait! Hey!

341
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,100
Sir, do you mind calling back
in about five minutes, please?

342
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,400
We'll have a table
in a few moments.

343
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,200
Excuse me.

344
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,900
Give us a bottle
of your finest champagne...

345
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,300
five shrimp cocktails
and some bread for my brother.

346
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,000
We have a Dom Perignon '71
at $120.

347
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,100
That'll be fine, pal.

348
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,500
Seriously, the food here is really
expensive. The soup is fucking $10!

349
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,400
Let's go outside.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

350
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,100
We're putting the band
back together.

351
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,500
- Forget it. No way.
- We're on a mission from God.

352
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,500
Hold it. Hold it.
What's this?

353
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,400
Waiter? Sir?

354
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,600
Please, waiter?

355
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,800
Yes, sir? How are your salads?

356
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,300
The salads are fine.

357
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,800
It's just that we'd like
to move to another table...

358
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,200
away from those two gentlemen.

359
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,100
Why? Have they been
disturbing you?

360
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,700
No. It's just that--

361
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,100
Well, frankly,
they're offensive-smelling.

362
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,800
I mean, they smell bad.

363
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,200
Excuse me. I'll see if I can locate
another table for you.

364
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,600
thank you.

365
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,200
Wrong glass, sir.

366
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,500
How much for the little girl?

367
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,600
- The women? How much for the women?
- What?

368
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,700
I want to buy your women.

369
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,000
Your little girl. Your daughters.
Sell them to me.

370
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,400
- Sell me your children.
- Maitre d'!

371
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,900
Cut it out. The owners are gonna
ask me to call the cops.

372
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,300
- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
- He just got outta Joliet.

373
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,400
He's on parole. You can't
call the cops on him, man.

374
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,300
- We're putting the band back together.
- I said no.

375
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,800
Absolutely not!

376
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,100
How much for your wife?

377
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,300
We're putting the band back together.
We need you, man. We need your horn.

378
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,100
I really can't.

379
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,500
We got everybody except
Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy and Blue Lou.

380
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,800
- We're getting them next.
- No way.

381
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,800
If you say no, Elwood and I
will come here for breakfast...

382
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,700
lunch and dinner
every day of the week.

383
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,200
Okay. I'll play.
You got me.

384
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,900
Sir?

385
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,300
White men!

386
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,500
White women!

387
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,400
The swastika is calling you!

388
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,100
The sacred and ancient symbol
of your race...

389
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,000
since the beginning of time.

390
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,400
The Jew is using the black...

391
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,800
as muscle against you.

392
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,400
And you are left there, helpless.

393
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,100
-Fuck you!
-What are you gonna do about it, withy?

394
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,500
-Just sit there?
- Go back where you came from!

395
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,300
Of course not!

396
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,200
- Son of a bitch!
- You are going to join...

397
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,700
with us...

398
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,100
the members of...

399
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,200
the American Socialist
White People's Party:

400
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,600
an organization of decent...

401
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,700
law-abiding white folk...

402
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,200
just like you.

403
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,500
Go to hell, bastards!

404
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,000
Go to hell!

405
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,100
I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler...

406
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,100
the immortal leader of our race.

407
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,900
To the order for which he stands.

408
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,100
One great cause.

409
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,700
Sacred and invincible.

410
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,500
Hey, what's going on?

411
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,700
Those bums won their court case
so they're marching today.

412
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,800
- What bums?
- The fucking Nazi party.

413
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,000
Illinois Nazis.

414
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,600
I hate Illinois Nazis.

415
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,000
Heil Hitler!

416
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,200
Ten-hut!

417
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,100
- Gruppenfuehrer!
- Yes, sir!

418
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,600
Get that car's license plate number.

419
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,600
We're gonna kill
that son of a bitch.

420
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,000
Come on home, babe

421
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,200
Oh, come on home, woman

422
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:28,100
Oh, come on home, pretty baby

423
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,100
I love you

424
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,900
When she walk that walk

425
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,800
And talk that talk

426
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,100
And whisperin' my ear

427
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,000
Tell me that she love me

428
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,800
I love that talk

429
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,100
That baby talk

430
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,100
When she talk like that

431
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,200
I can't take it like that

432
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,900
Come on home to me, baby

433
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,400
Walk your walk
Talk your talk

434
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,500
Talk your talk, baby

435
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,100
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

436
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,900
That was ''Boom, Boom,''
a song that I wrote back in the '50s.

437
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,700
- No, you didn't.
- It was a hit.

438
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,900
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

439
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,100
I wrote ''Boom, Boom''!
I wrote ''Boom, Boom''!

440
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,700
- Can I help you, boys?
- You got any white bread?

441
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,100
Yes.

442
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,900
I'll have some
toasted white bread, please.

443
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,100
You want butter or jam
on that toast, honey?

444
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,300
No, ma'am. Dry.

445
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,200
- Got any fried chicken?
- Best damn chicken in the state.

446
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,000
Bring me four fried chickens
and a Coke.

447
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,300
You want chicken wings
or chicken legs?

448
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,800
Four fried chickens and a Coke.

449
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,700
And some dry white toast, please.

450
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,700
You all want anything to drink
with that?

451
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,400
- No, ma'am.
- A Coke.

452
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,700
Be up in a minute.

453
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,800
We got two honkies out there
dressed like Hasidic diamond merchants.

454
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,300
- Say what?
- They look like they're from the CIA.

455
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,100
- What they wanna eat?
- The tall one wants white-bread toast.

456
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,900
- Dry. With nothing on it.
- Elwood!

457
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,300
And the other one wants
four whole fried chickens and a Coke.

458
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,700
And Jake! Shit!
The Blues Brothers!

459
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,000
- Hi, Jake!
- Matt! How you doing?

460
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,700
- How was Joliet?
- Oh, it's bad.

461
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,500
On Thursday night
they serve a wicked pepper steak.

462
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,700
Can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls
at the Terre Haute Federal Pen.

463
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,900
Or that oatmeal
at the Cook County slammer.

464
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,400
- They're all pretty bad.
- Matt--

465
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,100
Me and Elwood--

466
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,500
we're putting the band back together.

467
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,000
We need you and Blue Lou.

468
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,400
Don't talk that way around here.
My old lady--

469
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,300
- She'll kill me.
- Ma'am, you gotta understand.

470
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,400
This is a lot bigger than any domestic
problems you might be experiencing.

471
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,400
Matt, what the hell
is he talking about?

472
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,500
- Don't get riled, sugar.
- Don't you ''sugar'' me!

473
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,500
Now, you not going
back on the road no more.

474
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,300
And you ain't playing
any more two-bit, sleazy dives.

475
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,900
You're living with me now...

476
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,500
and you're not gonna go sliding around
with your white hoodlum friends.

477
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,300
But, babes! This is Jake and Elwood!
The Blues Brothers!

478
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,000
The Blues Brothers! Shit!

479
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,200
They still owe you money, fool!

480
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,300
Ma'am.

481
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Would it make you feel better
if you knew...

482
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,600
that what we're asking Matt to do
is a holy thing?

483
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,600
You see,
we're on a mission from God.

484
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,400
Don't you blaspheme in here!

485
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,900
Now, this is my man,
my restaurant...

486
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,900
and you two are gonna
walk right out that door...

487
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,100
without your dry, white toast...

488
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,000
without your four fried chickens...

489
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,500
and without Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy!

490
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,200
Now you listen to me!
I love you.

491
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,100
But I'm the man
and you're the woman.

492
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,100
And I'll make the decisions
concerning my life!

493
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,900
You better think about
what you saying.

494
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,400
You better think about
the consequences of your actions.

495
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,700
Shut up, woman!

496
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,300
You better think

497
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,200
Think about what you're
trying to do to me

498
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,000
Yeah, think

499
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,500
Let your mind go
Let your self be free

500
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,900
Let's go back

501
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,800
Let's go way on back when

502
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,800
I didn't even know you, you couldn't
have been too much more than ten

503
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,000
I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with degree

504
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,400
It don't take too much high IQ
to see what you're doing to me

505
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,000
You better think

506
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,100
Think about what you're trying
to do to me

507
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,800
Think

508
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,100
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

509
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,000
Freedom

510
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,100
Yeah, freedom right now

511
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,400
Hey, think about it

512
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,000
You, think about it

513
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,800
There ain't nothing you could ask
I could answer you, but I won't

514
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,900
But I was gonna change that, I'm not
if you keep doing things I don't

515
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,100
Think about what you're trying
to do to me

516
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,300
Damn it

517
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,100
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

518
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,400
People walking around every day
playing games and taking scores

519
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,800
Tryin' to make people lose their mind
Now, be careful you don't lose yours

520
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,000
You need me

521
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,900
And I need you

522
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,100
Without each other
there ain't nothing either can do

523
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,900
- Yeah, think about it, baby
- What you trying to do to me

524
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,800
To the bone
Think about it right now

525
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,400
Oh, freedom

526
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You, think about it

527
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,100
There ain't nothing you could ask
I can answer you, but l won't

528
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,300
But l was gonna change my mind
if you keep doing things I don't

529
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,400
You need me

530
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,200
And I need you

531
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,600
Without each other
there ain't nothing either can do

532
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,200
- Think about it, baby
- What you're trying to do to me

533
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,600
To the bone, man

534
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,400
Think about it, baby

535
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
- Yeah, right on
- To the bone

536
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,900
- For deepening
- To the bone, for deeps

537
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,400
Deepening

538
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,200
Right now

539
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,000
Think about it, yeah, yeah

540
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,300
To the bone
For deepening

541
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,400
Think about it

542
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,900
To the bone

543
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,400
Don't give me the Blues Brothers

544
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,000
You had better

545
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,700
Stop and think about it

546
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,500
Think

547
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,300
Let's boogie.

548
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,000
Well, go ahead, damn it!

549
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,500
Shit!

550
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,000
Pardon me...

551
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,800
but we do have a strict policy
concerning handling the instruments:

552
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,100
An employee
of Ray's Music Exchange...

553
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,000
must be present.

554
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,700
Now, may I help you?

555
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,600
Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake.

556
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,300
I once rented some column speakers
from you...

557
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
for my band-- The Blues Brothers.

558
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,900
Hey, Ray. It's me. Murph,
of Murph and the Magic Tones.

559
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,700
Remember me?
I bought three Fender amps.

560
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,600
- Oh, we sell a lot of amplifiers.
- Not like these. They were beautiful.

561
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:39,100
- Upholstered with thick, red shag.
- Right!

562
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,700
I remember now.
I'll buy them all back for 350 a piece.

563
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,300
Three fifty?

564
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,800
I paid 800 each
not six months ago.

565
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,400
You know-- depreciation, man.

566
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,400
Ray, we're here to buy stuff.

567
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,500
We need pianos, amps, mikes--
the works.

568
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,200
Go on! Get!

569
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,700
Breaks my heart:
a boy that young going bad.

570
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,200
Tell me a little
about this electric piano.

571
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,100
You have a good eye, my man.

572
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,200
That's the best
in the city of Chicago.

573
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,700
- How much?
- Two thousand bucks and it's yours.

574
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,800
You can take it home with you.
I'll throw in the black keys for free.

575
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,300
Two thousand
for this chunk of shit?

576
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,200
Come on, Ray!

577
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,500
Really, Ray. It's used.
There's no action left in this keyboard.

578
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,900
Excuse me.

579
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,400
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the action on this piano.

580
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,200
Well, I heard about the fella
you've been dancing with

581
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,200
All over the neighborhood

582
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,900
So why didn't you ask me, baby

583
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,600
Didn't you think I could

584
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,500
Well, I know that the bugaloo
is out of sight

585
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,200
But the shing-a-ling's
the thing tonight

586
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,900
But if that was you and me
out there, baby

587
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,400
l would have shown you
how to do it right

588
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,500
Do it right

589
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,500
Twisting

590
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,500
Shake it, shake it, baby

591
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,500
Here we go loop-de-loop

592
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,900
Shake it out, baby

593
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,300
Here we go loop-de-lai

594
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,300
Bend over
Let me see you shake your tail feather

595
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,600
Come on
Let me see you shake your tail feather

596
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,700
Come on
Come on, baby

597
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,900
Allright

598
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,200
Do the twist

599
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,500
Do the fly

600
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,800
Do the swim

601
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,500
And do the bird

602
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,800
Do the duck

603
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,900
Do the monkey

604
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,900
Watusi

605
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,100
And what about the frug

606
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,800
Do the mashed potato

607
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,600
What about the bugaloo

608
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,700
Oh, the Bony Maronie

609
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,900
Come on, let's do the twist

610
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,600
Twisting

611
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,000
Shake it, shake it, baby

612
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,300
Okay, man.

613
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,200
We'll take these axes.

614
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,800
Naturally. And as usual,
I gotta take an IOU.

615
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,000
You guys go inside.
Get yourselves a bite.

616
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,100
I've got to make a phone call.

617
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,200
Does this phone call
concern our first gig?

618
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,600
Have I ever lied to you?

619
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,400
What are we gonna do, man?
We don't got no gig.

620
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,500
How much money you got?

621
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,500
- I got a quarter.
- That's enough for a phone call.

622
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,600
Come on.

623
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,400
- What are you doing?
- You said we were gonna make a call.

624
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,200
I said I was gonna make a call.

625
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,100
Who are you gonna call, Jake?

626
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,900
Do you remember Maury Sline?

627
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,400
Sline? Booking agent?
What about him?

628
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,400
He got us some good showcases
in the old days.

629
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,900
He got us the Morgan Park.
He got us the Ticktock.

630
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,200
I got him laid.
He owes me.

631
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,900
Give it a shot.

632
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,400
There's got to be at least
seven dollars' worth of change here.

633
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,000
Sir.

634
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,800
- What did you find out?
- Okay.

635
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,800
I called a friend
at the Motor Vehicle Department.

636
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:34,200
That license plate is like a rash
all over the computer.

637
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,000
The car belongs
to a known traffic menace.

638
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,600
- What's his name?
- His name is Elwood Blues.

639
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:43,600
He's got a record a mile long.
And he's a Catholic.

640
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,000
- Did you get his address?
- Of course.

641
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,600
1060 West Addison.

642
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,200
Let's go.

643
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,800
Anybody with that kind of record
is gonna make a mistake.

644
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,900
I want all party members
in the tristate district...

645
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,900
to monitor the city, county
and state police on their CBs.

646
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,200
Mr Blues is gonna fuck up.

647
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,700
And when he does...

648
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,500
he better pray the police get to him
before we do.

649
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,000
We been in this car for three hours now.
Where is this place?

650
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,200
I told you it'd take
a little while to get there.

651
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:45,600
- What's the name of the place?
- The name of the place is--

652
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,100
Bob's Country Bunker.

653
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,600
- Here we are.
- Bob's Country Bunker?

654
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,500
The sign says, ''Tonight only,
the Good Ole Boys.''

655
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,000
Blues Brothers! It should read,
''Tonight only...

656
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,700
the Blues Brothers'
triumphant return.''

657
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,200
Must be some kind of mistake.

658
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,100
You guys unload the stuff.

659
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,700
Elwood, come with me.

660
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,500
What can I get you boys?

661
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,000
You thirsty, hungry
or just driving through?

662
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,800
Maybe you'd like a beer
or something a little harder?

663
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,400
We happen to make
the state's best pepper steak.

664
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
No, thank you, ma'am.

665
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,100
We may be sucking back
a few beers later on.

666
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,800
We'll be here all night.
You see, we're the band.

667
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,000
You are?
Gee, that's nice!

668
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,200
Hey, Bob, this is the band!

669
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,000
All right!

670
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,100
What kind of music
do you usually have here?

671
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,800
We got both kinds.
We got country and western.

672
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,500
Jake, are you sure this is the place?

673
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,100
Yeah, sure. This is the place.

674
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,800
- Hi! You the Good Ole Boys?
- That's us!

675
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:35,800
The rest of the band's
in the parking lot getting our stuff.

676
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,000
Well, I'm sure glad
to have you boys here.

677
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,200
I'm Bob and this here is my place.

678
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:43,900
Well, it's a beautiful place, Bob!

679
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:47,900
I guess you wanna get your steel guitars
and everything set up on stage.

680
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Claire, get up and turn those stage
lights on and get these boys going.

681
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,900
Chicken wire?

682
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,000
What do you say
we have a sound check?

683
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,800
Excuse me, sonny. I'll give this
to you. You're the tallest one.

684
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,200
Okay. What is it?

685
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,500
That there is a list
of the songs...

686
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,400
that you boys
will be playing tonight.

687
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,900
I don't think we know
any of the songs on this list.

688
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,700
This list doesn't mean anything.
They're just requests.

689
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,300
Do our regular set.
First tune.

690
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,700
''Give Me Some Loving.''
One, two--

691
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,600
One, two, three, four.

692
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,800
Shit!

693
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,100
What are those damn freak
pecker heads playing?

694
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:08,100
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We're glad to be here tonight.

695
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,900
We're the Good Old Blues Brothers
Boys Band from Chicago.

696
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,000
We hope you'll like our show.
I'm Elwood. This is my brother Jake.

697
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,700
Well, my temperature's rising
And my feet on the floor

698
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,700
Crazy people knockin'
'Cause they want some more

699
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,100
Let me in, baby
I don't know what you got

700
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,500
Better take it easy
'Cause this place is hot

701
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,300
And I'm so glad we made it

702
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,400
That ain't no Hank Williams song!

703
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,400
Give me some loving

704
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,300
Get off the stage!

705
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,200
Everyday

706
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,800
Why'd they turn off the lights?

707
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,300
- Maybe they blew a fuse.
- I don't think so.

708
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,200
Those lights are off on purpose.

709
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,200
We gotta figure out something
these people like, and fast!

710
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,600
I got it. Remember the theme
from ''Rawhide''?

711
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,000
Old favorite. Rowdy Yates.

712
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,800
- What key?
- ''A.'' Good country key.

713
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,200
''Rawhide'' in ''A.''

714
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,100
Rollin', rollin'

715
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,100
Though the streams are swollen

716
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,200
Keep them dogies rollin'

717
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,800
Rawhide

718
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,700
Through rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather

719
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:27,900
Wishin' my gal was by my side

720
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,900
All the things l'm missin'

721
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,100
Good vittles, love and kissin'

722
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,600
Are waiting at the end of my ride

723
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:37,800
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

724
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,100
- Head 'em out
- Move 'em on

725
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,300
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

726
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,800
Rawhide
Cut 'em out

727
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,100
Ride 'em in

728
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,400
Cut 'em out

729
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,700
Ride 'em in, rawhide

730
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,800
Theme from the TV show ''Rawhide.''
thank you.

731
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,500
We'd like to do a favorite of the horn
section. We hope it's one of yours.

732
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:04,800
Sometimes it's hard
to be a woman

733
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,800
Giving all your love

734
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,000
To just one man

735
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,900
And if you love him

736
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:23,400
Oh, be proud of him

737
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,400
'Cause after all

738
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,100
He's just a man

739
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:35,100
Stand by your man

740
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:39,000
Give him two arms to cling to

741
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,500
And something warm to come to

742
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,700
When nights are cold and lonely

743
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,500
Stand by your man

744
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,900
And tell the world you love him

745
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:59,800
Keep giving all the love you can

746
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:07,300
Stand by your man

747
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,500
Stand by your man

748
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,800
And show the world you love him

749
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:24,300
Keep giving all the love you can

750
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,400
Baby

751
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,800
Stand by

752
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,900
Your man

753
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,100
Well, folks, it's time
to call it a night.

754
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,800
But do what you feel,
and keep both feet on the wheel.

755
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
You don't have to go home
but you can't stay here.

756
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,300
So, till next time:

757
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,500
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

758
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,800
- Head 'em up
- Move 'em on

759
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,900
Rawhide

760
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,100
- Cut 'em out
- Ride 'em in

761
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,300
- Ride 'em in
- Cut 'em out

762
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,900
Ride 'em in, rawhide

763
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,400
Let's get the hell out of here.

764
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:30,600
Shit, I wanna tell you, that's some
of the best goddam music we've had...

765
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,800
at the Country Bunker
in a long time.

766
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,800
Well, sorry we couldn't remember
''The Wreck of the Old 97.''

767
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,600
Why, hell! You guys can learn it
next time when you come back.

768
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,800
Bob, about our money for tonight.

769
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,400
That's right.

770
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,500
Two hundred dollars...

771
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,100
and you boys drank
$300 worth of beer.

772
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,300
When we first came in...

773
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:56,100
the bar lady never charged us
for the first round.

774
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:00,000
So, like, we figured
beer was complimentary for the band.

775
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,500
Well, I'll just go out
and take up a collection from the boys.

776
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,000
I sure would appreciate it.

777
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,300
I say this trip is nowhere, man.

778
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,900
I say we gotta quit.

779
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,900
What? Quit?

780
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,100
I wish you guys
would make up your mind.

781
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,700
Otherwise I gotta call Mr Ronzini at
the Holiday Inn to get our old gig back.

782
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,300
Back at the Armada Room?

783
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,200
Listen, they want us
to pay for the beer we drank.

784
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,400
So you'd better split.

785
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,300
The next gig is gonna be dynamite!

786
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,600
Huge! You'll see.

787
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,700
I say we give the Blues Brothers
just one more chance.

788
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,100
Why not? If the shit fits, wear it!

789
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,200
Scoot over, goddam it!

790
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,500
Boys look a little upset.

791
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:04,200
Hey, man. Don't worry.
We got a couple of days.

792
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,300
We'll get the Penguin's tax money.

793
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,300
I mean, look. We got an appointment
to see Mr Sline tomorrow.

794
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,200
Everything's gonna be all right.

795
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,700
Let's skate.

796
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,000
Goddam it.

797
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,700
Excuse me. Are you
the Good Ole Boys?

798
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:25,800
That's right. I'm Tucker McElroy,
lead singer, driver of the Winnebago.

799
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,300
I'd like to talk to you,
but we're running very late.

800
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,300
I'm Jacob Stein, American Federation
of Musicians Union, Local 200.

801
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,900
I've been sent here to see
if you're carrying your permits.

802
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,500
Our what?

803
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,000
Your union cards.
May I see your cards, please?

804
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,300
Suppose we ain't got no union cards,
and we go in and start playing anyway?

805
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,400
What you gonna do about that?
You gonna stop us?

806
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,500
Stein!

807
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:52,200
You gonna look funny trying to eat
corn on the cob with no fucking teeth!

808
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:58,100
Listen, let me talk to Bob,
the owner.

809
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:01,100
See if we can put your band
on contract waivers for tonight.

810
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,700
I don't want you to move
from this spot.

811
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,600
Just let me handle this.

812
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,100
We'll talk to Bob.

813
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,100
Get in the car and start her up.

814
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,600
You know you boys owe me
a lot of money for that beer you drank!

815
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,700
- Goddam it!
- Bob, we loved playing here tonight.

816
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,400
My brother's writing out an
American Express traveler's check...

817
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,200
to cover the bar tab.

818
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,900
I sure would appreciate it.

819
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:36,400
I'd better check up, see how he's doing.
I have to sign it too.

820
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:41,100
I usually sit in the car and write it
out on the glove compartment lid.

821
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,800
Need a pencil.

822
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,800
- Were them guys from the union?
- What the hell, ''union''?

823
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,000
Those boys skipped out of here
owing me a lot of money for beer.

824
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,400
What the hell are you guys
all dressed up for?

825
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,900
We're the Good Ole Boys!

826
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,900
You're the Good Ole Boys?

827
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,800
''A.F.M.'' Shit!

828
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,300
Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration,
don't fail me now!

829
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,800
I don't believe it!
It's that shit-box Dodge again.

830
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,100
The bastards are ours now!

831
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,700
Holy shit!

832
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,100
Boys, you in big trouble.

833
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,400
Maury, you owe me.

834
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,200
We'll play anywhere, anytime,
for anybody.

835
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,900
Put us in the Double Up Lounge, or
the Morgan Park Theatre, or the Crystal.

836
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,300
We always knocked them dead
in those joints.

837
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,600
Discos. They're all discos.

838
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,300
Singles. Mixed singles.
Gay singles.

839
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,100
These people like to dance
with each other.

840
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,000
We are a dance band.

841
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,400
I don't know, boys.
I just don't know.

842
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,500
Times have changed,
you know what I mean?

843
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,500
What are you guys gonna do?
The same act?

844
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,400
You wear
the same farkakte suits.

845
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,200
You'll scare people away.

846
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,000
Don't you ever wear blue jeans
or jump suits...

847
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,500
like Wayne Cochran
and the C.C. Riders?

848
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,000
You gotta come through for us.

849
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,200
We need 5,000 bucks fast.

850
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,300
Five thousand bucks?

851
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,900
Who do you think you are?
The Beatles?

852
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,100
You know the size hall you gotta work
to take in that kind of money?

853
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,600
We'll fill any hall in the country.

854
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,000
You guys familiar
with the Palace Hotel ballroom?

855
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,300
- Never heard of it.
- Nice place up north.

856
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,400
Built in the '40s
on Lake Wazapamani.

857
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,300
That seats 5,000.

858
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,700
You guys fill that place,
you can make 5,000 bucks, easy.

859
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:04,300
- Book us for tomorrow night.
- Hold it! Tomorrow night?

860
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:07,100
A gig like that, you gotta prepare
the proper exploitation.

861
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,900
I know about that stuff.
I been exploited all my life.

862
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,300
Forget it. There's no way
with you guys. Forget about it.

863
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:18,500
Say, how's Mrs Sline?

864
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,400
I might have some information
she'd like to know.

865
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,100
You blackmailing me?

866
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,700
If you wanna put it that way.
Maury, we need this gig!

867
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,200
We're on a mission from God.

868
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,500
Get us the hall, and I guarantee
we'll pack them in for miles around.

869
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,200
What do you say?

870
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,700
Okay. I'll get you the Palace Hotel.

871
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,900
I'll print up show bills. I'll make
the place look real pretty, okay?

872
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:51,700
I don't think you guys
are gonna gross dollar one.

873
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,200
But if you do, I want a taste
of the gig, okay?

874
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,800
Thanks, Maury.
Let's go, boys!

875
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,200
Listen, you boys heard me talk
about Jake and Elwood.

876
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,600
They used to live here,
just like you.

877
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,100
And I used to sing to them,
just like with you.

878
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:16,700
Tonight Jake and Elwood are going out
to sing and play...

879
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,700
to raise money
to help you children.

880
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,700
Your lazy butts are in this too!

881
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,700
So get up on that wagon.

882
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,800
We're going up north
to put the word on the streets.

883
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:49,700
Tonight only,
the fabulous Blues Brothers...

884
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,400
Rhythm and Blues Revue...

885
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:56,900
at the Palace Hotel ballroom,

886
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:59,300
Lake Wazapamani.

887
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,400
The fabulous Blues Brothers...

888
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,800
Show Band and Revue.

889
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,900
There you go, boy.

890
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,100
All right, man!

891
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,900
Check it out!

892
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,200
- Tonight only!
- From Chicago!

893
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,200
- The Blues Brothers.
- Rhythm and Blues Revue.

894
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,800
One night only!
The fabulous--

895
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,500
Blues Brothers Show Band
and Revue.

896
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,500
You! On the motorcycle!

897
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,900
You two girls!

898
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,500
- Tell your friends!
- Free parking.

899
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,000
Two-dollar cover charge only, folks!

900
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,300
- That's a lot of entertainment.
- For two dollars.

901
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:48,300
Will you please put this in the window,
'cause it's real important.

902
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,700
Tonight only, from Chicago...

903
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,900
the fabulous Blues Brothers...

904
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,300
Rhythm and Blues Revue...

905
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:10,700
for your dancing pleasure.

906
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,100
And it's ladies' night tonight.

907
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,900
at the Palace Hotel ballroom.

908
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,800
''Tonight only, the Blues Brothers...

909
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,000
genuine Rhythm and Blues Show
and Revue.

910
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,400
Palace Hotel ballroom.
Tonight only.''

911
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,300
How we doing?

912
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:42,000
So far we covered Lake, McHenry...

913
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,800
and part of Du Page County.

914
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,100
Good. Let's get to the gig.

915
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,300
What is it?

916
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,500
We're out of gas.

917
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,200
Oh, shit.

918
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:20,900
Wow! A classic. What a room!

919
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,500
This place is gonna swing tonight.

920
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,300
It's a fucking barn.
We'll never fill it.

921
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,800
We've gotta fill this hall tonight.

922
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,900
A lot of young children
are depending on it.

923
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,200
Young children?
What do you mean?

924
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:35,000
Jake and Elwood are donating
the band's share of the door money...

925
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,500
to pay the taxes
on the St. Helen's orphanage...

926
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,100
in Calumet City.

927
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,600
What?

928
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,600
- We're out of gas.
- Yep. Mind if we fill her up?

929
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,800
Nope. I said ''we're'' out of gas.

930
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,700
Tanker truck's late.
Should have been here two hours ago.

931
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,700
It's always late on Thursdays.

932
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:57,400
I guess we'll have to wait.

933
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,400
Excuse me, sir.

934
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:28,000
Yes, you. Could you fill it up
with premium, and check under the hood?

935
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,200
Sure.

936
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,100
You want I should wash
the dead bugs off the windshield?

937
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,100
No. I'm in kind of a hurry.

938
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,700
Where in the hell are they?

939
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:55,100
So maybe you'd like to come by
and see the show.

940
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:58,900
I'm awfully sorry, but I do have
a prior dinner engagement.

941
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,700
Thanks, Marvin.

942
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,100
Get me Troopers Daniel and Mount.

943
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,800
I don't see those Blues Brothers.

944
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:25,900
We'll wait.

945
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:30,500
Okay, you're all set.

946
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:34,400
That'll be $94.

947
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,600
Here's 95.
thank you.

948
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,800
Okay. And that's a dollar change.

949
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,200
- Oh, keep the change.
- Thanks.

950
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,400
So, look. If your date...

951
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,900
don't work out tonight
for any reason...

952
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:56,900
there's a motel
up on the interstate.

953
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,900
Maybe we could, say, meet...

954
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,500
around midnight?

955
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,900
I'll think about it, Elwood, okay?

956
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,600
Bye.

957
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:25,900
Son of a bitch!

958
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,900
Come on!

959
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:03,000
We're really late.
You'd better step on it.

960
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,900
I always like to perform
for angry mobs.

961
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,400
You can't quit now.

962
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,800
What can they be doing?

963
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,800
My head hurts.

964
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,600
That Night Train's a mean wine.

965
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,500
You'd better get bright!
We got a show to do.

966
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,900
Then we gotta figure out
some way to collect that gate money...

967
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:47,900
get it to the County Assessor's office
as soon as they open in the morning.

968
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,800
We want the show!

969
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,200
Gentlemen, I'm leaving.

970
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,600
Man, we were so close.

971
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,700
Hey, you guys know
''Minnie The Moocher''?

972
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:17,000
I knew a hooker once
named Minnie Mazola.

973
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,400
No! The song ''Minnie the Moocher.''

974
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,700
- Yeah. So what?
- Hit it!

975
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:56,300
Hey, folks, here's a story
'bout Minnie the Moocher

976
01:37:56,300 --> 01:38:01,100
She was a low-down hoochie coocher

977
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:04,900
She was the roughest, toughest frail

978
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:07,500
But Minnie had a heart

979
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,400
As big as a whale

980
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,700
She messed around
with a bloke named Smokey

981
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:37,200
She loved him
though he was cokey

982
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:41,300
He took her down to Chinatown

983
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:46,600
And he showed her how
to kick the gong around

984
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,800
She had a dream
about the King of Sweden

985
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,800
He gave her things
that she was needin'

986
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:39,400
He gave her a home
built of gold and steel

987
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:43,800
A diamond car
with the platinum wheels

988
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,600
This is glue. Strong stuff.

989
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,600
What the hell are you doing?

990
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,900
This can is from
a surplus disposal run.

991
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,900
Fifteen overcharged ounces
of pure, uncompounded...

992
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,600
isopropyl butane monosulfate.

993
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,900
When combined with oxygen
and a little heat...

994
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,000
it will cause a rapid expansion.

995
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:33,400
Poor Min, poor Min

996
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,200
- Let's take them!
- Wait a minute.

997
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:21,000
I've never even heard
these boys sing, all right?

998
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,800
All right.

999
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,000
They're not going no place.

1000
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,700
All right, cover all exits! Let's go!
Come on! Hurry up!

1001
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:33,000
Move it!

1002
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,900
Who wants an Orange Whip?
Orange Whip?

1003
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,700
Three Orange Whips.

1004
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,900
Excuse us.

1005
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:20,000
Good evening, ladies.

1006
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,400
One, two,
one, two, three, four.

1007
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:23,500
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the
distinct pleasure of the management...

1008
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:27,500
to present to you
the evening's star attraction.

1009
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:31,900
Here they are, back after
their exclusive three-year tour...

1010
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:35,900
of Europe, Scandinavia
and the subcontinent.

1011
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:39,500
Won't you welcome
from Calumet City, Illinois...

1012
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:44,800
the show band
of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues.

1013
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,200
The Blues Brothers!

1014
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,800
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1015
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:37,500
We're so glad to see
so many lovely people here tonight.

1016
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:40,100
We'd like to welcome
all the representatives...

1017
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,900
of Illinois' law enforcement
community...

1018
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:45,400
who have chosen to join us in
the Palace Hotel ballroom at this time.

1019
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,700
We certainly hope you all
enjoy the show.

1020
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:49,700
And remember that
no matter who you are...

1021
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,100
and what you do
to live and survive...

1022
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:55,000
there's still some things
that make us all the same.

1023
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,800
You. Me. Them. Everybody.

1024
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,700
Everybody

1025
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:05,100
Needs somebody

1026
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:07,500
Everybody

1027
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:11,100
Needs somebody to love

1028
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,800
Someone to love

1029
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,500
Sweetheart to miss

1030
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,000
Sugar to kiss

1031
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,100
I need you, you, you

1032
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,200
In the morning

1033
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,500
When my soul's on fire

1034
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,800
Sometimes I feel

1035
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:36,800
I feel a little sad inside

1036
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,200
When my baby mistreats me
I never, never

1037
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,700
Find a place to hide
I need you

1038
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:03,200
Sometimes I feel

1039
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,300
I feel a little sad inside

1040
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:07,500
When my baby mistreats me

1041
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:11,500
I never, never find a place to hide
I need you

1042
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:22,100
People, when you do find
that special somebody...

1043
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,300
you gotta hold that man,
hold that woman...

1044
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:25,900
love him, please him,
squeeze her, please her!

1045
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:28,200
Signify your feelings
with every caress.

1046
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,500
Because it's so important
to have that special somebody...

1047
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,700
to hold, kiss, miss...

1048
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,400
to squeeze and please!

1049
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,400
Everybody needs somebody

1050
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:41,000
Everybody

1051
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,700
Needs somebody to love

1052
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,100
Someone to love

1053
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:49,600
Sweetheart to miss

1054
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,800
Sugar to kiss

1055
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:54,000
I need you, you

1056
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,400
In the morning

1057
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,400
When my soul's on fire

1058
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:10,200
When there ain't no one around
I need you

1059
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:43,000
thank you.
That was for Wilson Pickett.

1060
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,900
This is dedicated
to the late, great Magic Sam.

1061
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:52,600
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1062
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:03,900
Come on
Baby, don't you wanna go

1063
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:16,800
Back to that same old place

1064
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,000
Sweet home Chicago

1065
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:24,200
Six and three is nine

1066
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:25,900
Nine and nine is eighteen

1067
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:29,100
Look there, brother, baby
and see what I see

1068
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:34,300
- The Mafia's after us now.
- You guys were hot!

1069
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:37,400
You were great!
I've got to record you.

1070
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,400
- Bullshit.
- I don't bullshit.

1071
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,200
I'm president of Clarion Records...

1072
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,500
the largest recording company
on the eastern seaboard.

1073
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:47,000
- So what?
- Here's $10,000.

1074
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,900
An advance on your first
recording session.

1075
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:53,200
Is it a deal?

1076
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,500
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal.

1077
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,400
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal!

1078
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,200
Listen, all these cops out here--
they're waiting for us.

1079
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:05,500
We gotta get out with nobody
seeing us. You know a back door out?

1080
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,500
Sure. I used to be head bouncer here
back in the '70s.

1081
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:12,200
There's an electrical service duct
behind your drummer's riser.

1082
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,200
Do us a favor.

1083
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:17,300
Take $1,400 and give it
to Ray's Music Exchange...

1084
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,100
in Calumet City,
and give the rest to the band.

1085
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:21,800
- You got it.
- Thanks.

1086
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,600
Bye.

1087
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:43,200
Me and Elwood are gonna make a break
for it. You and the band keep playing.

1088
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:03,300
- Something's wrong.
- Where's Jake?

1089
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,300
Where'd they go?

1090
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,400
I sure hope this thing
leads someplace.

1091
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:25,900
Elwood, we're gone, man.

1092
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:36,500
Who is that girl?

1093
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,800
Well, Jake.

1094
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,600
You look just fine down there...

1095
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,800
slithering in the mud
like vermin.

1096
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,600
No problem.

1097
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:48,700
You're not gonna get away from me
this time.

1098
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,400
Check that out! Let's go!

1099
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,800
It's good to see you,
sweetheart!

1100
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:19,800
You contemptible pig.

1101
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:24,700
I remained celibate for you.

1102
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:27,500
I stood at the back
of a cathedral...

1103
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:30,000
waiting, in celibacy, for you...

1104
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,500
with 300 friends and relatives
in attendance.

1105
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:36,700
My uncle hired the best
Rumanian caterers in the state.

1106
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:39,100
To obtain the seven limousines...

1107
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:42,300
my father used up his last favors
with Mad Pete Trullo.

1108
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:46,200
So for me, for my mother...

1109
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:50,100
my grandmother, my father,
my uncle and for the common good...

1110
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:53,400
I must now kill you
and your brother.

1111
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:09,200
Oh, please don't kill us!

1112
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,800
You know I love you, baby! I wouldn't
leave you! It wasn't my fault!

1113
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,700
You miserable slug!

1114
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:20,100
You think you can talk your way
out of this? You betrayed me!

1115
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:23,000
No, I didn't. Honest!

1116
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,900
I ran out of gas!

1117
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:28,000
I had a flat tyre!
I didn't have money for cab fare!

1118
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
My tux didn't come back
from the cleaners.

1119
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,900
And old friend came in
from out of town!

1120
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:35,900
Someone stole my car! There was
an earthquake! A terrible flood!

1121
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:41,000
Locusts! It wasn't my fault,
I swear to God!

1122
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:04,600
Jake, honey.

1123
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,900
Let's go.

1124
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,400
Take it easy.

1125
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,200
You're now going to
totally demolish that car.

1126
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:47,200
You want to maybe consider
going after the Blues Brothers?

1127
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,400
It's 106 miles to Chicago.

1128
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:02,200
We got a full tank of gas,
half a pack of cigarettes...

1129
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,900
it's dark
and we're wearing sunglasses.

1130
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:05,800
Hit it.

1131
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,500
Shit, man. Can't this damn thing
go any faster than this?

1132
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,800
Bob, I think I've got
a little problem.

1133
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:58,200
Goddam, boy.

1134
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:22,500
Shit.

1135
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:51,600
Don't you say a fuckin' word.

1136
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:31,500
All units, we have a ten-seven-niner.

1137
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,100
Officers are in pursuit:

1138
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:36,500
a black-and-white
1974 Dodge sedan...

1139
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,400
southbound on 47.

1140
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,800
Respond to signal, ten-seven-niner.

1141
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:45,000
Occupants of vehicle:
one Joliet Jake Blues...

1142
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,100
one Elwood Blues.

1143
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:49,200
- Considered extremely dangerous.
- Gruppenfuehrer!

1144
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:04,200
Jake, I gotta pull over.

1145
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:15,100
Southbound on State Highway 47.

1146
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:42,600
Hi! Wanna hand me the mike?

1147
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,700
Thanks a lot.

1148
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:48,100
This is car--
What number are we?

1149
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,700
Five-five.

1150
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:53,200
Car 55. We're in a truck.

1151
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:03,100
Signal ten-seven-niner
still engaged.

1152
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:06,700
Vehicle traveling southbound
approaching Chicago city limits.

1153
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:09,600
Commander advises will contact
Chicago precincts...

1154
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:11,200
for a local intercept.

1155
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:12,500
Maintain pursuit.

1156
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:21,200
Use of unnecessary violence...

1157
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,800
in the apprehension
of the Blues Brothers has been approved.

1158
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:55,200
Well, this is definitely
Lower Wacker Drive.

1159
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,900
If my estimations are correct...

1160
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:02,400
we should be very close to
the Honorable Richard J. Daley Plaza.

1161
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,900
- That's where they got that Picasso.
- Yep.

1162
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,800
Son of a bitch!

1163
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:42,400
There they are.

1164
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:22,900
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck was that?

1165
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:25,400
The motor. It's thrown a rod.

1166
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:28,000
- Is that serious?
- Yep.

1167
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:56,800
Faster.

1168
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:48,800
Holy shit!

1169
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:10,500
I've always loved you.

1170
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:23,500
There it is!

1171
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,000
Come on!

1172
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:51,700
Sir, where's the office
of the assessor of Cook County?

1173
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:54,000
Down the hall. Turn right.

1174
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,600
Take the elevator to 1102.

1175
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,300
thank you, sir.

1176
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:13,200
Excuse me.
Did you see two guys...

1177
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:15,300
with black suits and hats,
one carrying a briefcase?

1178
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:17,300
Yeah. I just sent them down there.

1179
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,100
thank you.

1180
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:39,000
Hold the door.

1181
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:08,700
Let's go.

1182
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,300
Can I help you?

1183
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:22,200
- This is where they pay taxes, right?
- Right.

1184
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,900
This money is for
the year's assessment...

1185
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:27,000
on the St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud
Orphanage in Calumet City, Illinois.

1186
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,300
Five thousand bucks.
It's all there, pal.

1187
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,800
Stand back!

1188
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,000
Fire!

1189
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:04,900
And here is your receipt.

1190
02:13:22,600 --> 02:13:25,200
Warden threw a party
in the county jail

1191
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:27,700
Prison band was there
and they began to wail

1192
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:30,700
The band was jumping
and the joint began to swing

1193
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:32,400
You should of heard those
knocked-out jail birds sing

1194
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,200
Let's rock

1195
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:36,100
Everybody, let's rock

1196
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:39,700
Everybody on the whole cell block

1197
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:42,400
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

1198
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:45,100
Spider Murphy played
the tenor saxophone

1199
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:47,300
Little Joe was blowin'
on the slide trombone

1200
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:50,000
The drummer boy from Illinois
went crash, boom, bang

1201
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,100
The whole rhythm section
was the Purple Gang

1202
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:55,400
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock

1203
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,600
Everybody on the whole cell block

1204

Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

1205
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:08,900
Sad Sack was sitting
on a block of stone

1206
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:11,700
Way over in the corner
weeping all alone

1207
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:13,900
The warden said
Buddy, don't you be no square

1208
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:16,400
lf you can't get a partner
use a wooden chair

1209
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:18,100
Let's rock

1210
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:21,000
Everybody, let's rock

1211
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,500
Everybody on the whole cell block

1212
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:26,600
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock
