1
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,413
Truck looks great.
Must be a fortune here.

2
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:44,336
I know, just not in front of him, OK?

3
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,877
Fellas, what's going on?
I've been here too long.

4
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:50,977
- Give us a minute.
- No. Check this out.

5
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:56,140
You can't get no cleaner. These are
very popular with the children.

6
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:59,514
This is a federal tax stamp.
You can't get no cleaner.

7
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:02,476
You keep 'em
if it's such a great deal.

8
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,481
I ain't from Detroit. I don't know
nobody who can handle a job this big.

9
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:10,486
You're supposed to have the
connections. Do what you want to do.

10
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:15,200
- It ain't easy to get rid of this.
- I know, but I'm a businessman.

11
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:18,796
Warm up the truck.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

12
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,041
- Here you go.
- You're a sharp kid.

13
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:23,957
Thank you.

14
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:28,589
Cousin, my man, don't dash yet.
This looks like $2,000, not $5,000.

15
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:31,842
- Let me see.
- The deal is for 5,000.

16
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:35,179
I told my people
there should be five grand.

17
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:39,137
- They stiffed us.
- No, they stiffed you.

18
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:43,644
You can't count on anybody.
But let's not hassle about it now.

19
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:47,777
Take the two grand and on the next
score, I'll make it up to you.

20
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:51,029
Don't jerk me off. This is bullshit.

21
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:54,488
I need $5,000, not $2,000.
Don't do this to me.

22
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:57,450
Come on, you ain't dealin'
with Johnny Bananas.

23
00:03:57,554 --> 00:04:00,207
I know I ain't.
Can I have my money?

24
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:04,373
Can I say it slow for you?
I need $5,000. Read my lips.

25
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:08,084
$5,000 is what I need.
I can't do nothing with that.

26
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,591
You want to be an asshole,
smoke 'em yourself.

27
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:14,440
I don't smoke Lucky Strike.
I smoke King Size Kent.

28
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:20,197
Fuck this.
Nice doing business with you.

29
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,518
What you doing here?

30
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:26,229
Officer, you know what happened?
You ain't going to believe it.

31
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,491
The truck just stopped. You got
some cables, you give me a jump?

32
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:35,251
- Don't I know you?
- No, I'm from Buffalo.

33
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,255
Break out some ID.

34
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,095
Let's get the fuck outta here!

35
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:21,780
Shit!

36
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:58,372
Freeze, asshole!

37
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:10,057
Foley, we should have known
it was you!

38
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,221
Axel. Way to go!

39
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:20,597
- I don't have time.
- Todd's after you.

40
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:25,434
He said it's your worst fuck-up.
I don't think that's true.

41
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,980
- He's not in there.
- I see that.

42
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:32,611
If you'd busted them, maybe he
wouldn't be so mad, but you haggled.

43
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:35,986
$2,000 wasn't enough.
They'd have known I was a cop.

44
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:39,282
- Leave me alone.
- Don't go anywhere.

45
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:42,039
- You asshole.
- I'm not saying you did wrong,

46
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:45,708
but if you had busted them,
it would have been better.

47
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,084
- Where you going?
- Out of here.

48
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,667
- Big mistake. You want my advice?
- No.

49
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:53,880
Go in there, talk to him.
He'll be right back.

50
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:57,220
Jeff, get away from me.
I'm going to shoot you.

51
00:08:57,324 --> 00:09:01,350
- You know what I would do?
- Lighten up. I'm not listening. OK?

52
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:04,059
You're making it a lot worse
for yourself.

53
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,187
Look at this. Thank you, guys.

54
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,525
Axel, you got a cigarette?

55
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:13,946
- Did you write that one?
- Everybody knows about the truck.

56
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,208
Will you listen to me?
I am not listening to you.

57
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:20,574
Great. Real mature.

58
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:24,535
I am not listening to Jeffrey,
but he's still talking.

59
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,127
- I hate when you do that.
- Stop, then!

60
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:31,841
- Is that fucking Foley in here?
- There's Todd, it's show time.

61
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,469
Boss, I know...

62
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:40,219
Where do you come off going
undercover without my authorisation?

63
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:44,519
You want to play cowboy cop,
do it in someone else's precinct.

64
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:48,908
- Want to hear my side of the story?
- What's your side of the story?

65
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:52,068
Let's hear your side of the story.

66
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:56,236
Do you know how much this stunt
of yours is going to cost this city?

67
00:09:56,341 --> 00:10:01,036
Cost isn't the issue. It's my blatant
disregard for proper procedure.

68
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,452
You're damn right, wise-ass!

69
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:06,958
The mayor called the chief,
he called the deputy,

70
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:10,750
he chewed my ass out.
You see I don't have any of it left!

71
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:13,797
Where the fuck d'you get
the cigarettes from, anyway?

72
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:18,218
- From the Dearborn hijack.
- That bust went down last week.

73
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:21,972
- That truck should be in the pound.
- I told you.

74
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:25,227
- It's none of your business.
- This isn't my locker.

75
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:28,769
Listen, Axel.
No more set-ups, you understand?

76
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:31,399
You're a good cop
with great potential,

77
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,944
but you don't know
every fucking thing.

78
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:38,780
I'm tired of taking the heat for you.
Once more and you're on the street.

79
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:40,910
- Do you understand?
- Look...

80
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:43,295
Do you understand me?

81
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:47,131
Yeah, I understand. Boss...

82
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:52,085
Chief ain't chewed it all.
You still got some ass.

83
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:56,680
Don't fuck with me, Axel.
Not now. Go on, go home.

84
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:26,932
How you doing, man? How you doing?

85
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:29,395
Still breaking in people's houses.

86
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,567
What do you expect with that lock?
Buy a real lock.

87
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:35,488
I got my pistol.
I'll shoot somebody.

88
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:40,738
I can't afford no electric, close
my fridge. There's roaches in there.

89
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,158
So what's up, man? Look at you!

90
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,371
- When did you get out?
- Six months ago.

91
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,293
And you're just coming to see me now?

92
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:53,795
I got out early for good time and
I went to California, get some sun.

93
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,924
I gotta show you something.

94
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:59,471
I ain't seen you in two years, man.
What's up?

95
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:04,347
10,000 Deutschmarks.

96
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,561
- Deutschmark?
- Yeah.

97
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:10,519
- What is that?
- They're bearer bonds. Untraceable.

98
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,650
You stole 'em?

99
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:16,276
- No.
- I don't want to hear it.

100
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,826
- It's just good to see you.
- I missed you, man.

101
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:23,370
- What were you doing in California?
- Working.

102
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:25,496
- Working where?
- Guess.

103
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,834
- I don't know.
- Beverly Hills.

104
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:32,879
- What were you doing?
- You won't believe this.

105
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:35,596
I was a security guard.

106
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,720
Who'd hire you as a security guard?

107
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,940
- Jenny Summers.
- Jenny Summers?

108
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,351
I haven't seen Jenny in years.

109
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:48,645
- What's she up to?
- She's doing great.

110
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,895
She's manager of this art gallery.

111
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,902
The Hollis Benton Art Gallery,
Beverly Hills.

112
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:56,399
It's world famous. Ever hear of it?

113
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,613
Yeah, I buy all my art there.

114
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,742
Corner pocket, two cushions.

115
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,784
- 50 bucks you don't make that shot.
- Bullshit.

116
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,374
- 100.
- You got a bet.

117
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:19,052
- What are you gonna do?
- You're as bright as always.

118
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:23,010
20, 40, 60, 80, take it.
Have a party.

119
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,973
Pleasure doing business with you.

120
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,435
What the fuck you gonna do?

121
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,940
Miss, two more Scotch and sodas.

122
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:38,991
I got a great idea.
I got a great idea.

123
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:42,536
Let's steal a car.

124
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:47,039
Are you serious?

125
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:50,581
I'm a fucking police officer.
I can't steal cars no more.

126
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,710
How many times
have you stolen a car, man?

127
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:55,848
A fucking Cadillac!

128
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:03,731
Driving on the expressway
like two fucking maniacs.

129
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:09,434
I remember you went to jail for that.

130
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,234
- No, it was state school.
- That's jail when you're 15.

131
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:18,197
That ain't jail, man. That's like
day camp compared to jail.

132
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,045
How come you didn't tell on me
when you got caught?

133
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,336
You don't know?

134
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,544
- You don't know?
- No.

135
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,715
Because I love you, man.

136
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,480
One more round.

137
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,731
Hold still. Mike, I gotta open
the door, OK? Balance yourself.

138
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,151
Here we go, Mike.

139
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,528
I'm opening the door now, OK?
Here we go.

140
00:15:58,633 --> 00:15:59,675
Axel!

141
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,744
Hey, Mikey, where have you been?

142
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:09,874
What's up, Zack?

143
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:12,001
What have you got there, Mikey?

144
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,138
What is this? Your laundry?

145
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:19,425
I swear,
I was going to bring 'em back.

146
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,969
- You got lost?
- No.

147
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:26,313
I came to see my friend. I had 'em
with me. I figured, you know...

148
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:31,648
- What you doing?
- What am I supposed to do, Mikey?

149
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:36,482
There was a whole box of them. I
didn't think anybody'd miss a couple.

150
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:38,567
I figured I'd take 'em...

151
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:41,613
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

152
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:43,751
No, shut up.

153
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:48,467
- Man, please.
- Just shut up, Mikey.

154
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:54,012
I swear...

155
00:16:56,352 --> 00:17:00,885
I swear, if you ever show
your face out there again...

156
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,554
- Ever.
- I won't. I promise you. I'm sorry.

157
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:09,643
I fucked up, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

158
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:12,196
- Ever.
- I'm sorry.

159
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:42,800
Axel, go to the hospital and get
that bump on your head checked out.

160
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:46,399
- My head is all right, man.
- It's not a request, Axel.

161
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:02,284
Boss. Boss...
Can I talk to you for a minute?

162
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:06,285
I heard you got Rand on this case.

163
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,662
He doesn't know the time of day.

164
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,580
Don't mess with me.

165
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:13,292
He hasn't left his desk in 12 years.

166
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:16,214
At least he's had 12 years.

167
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:21,720
Anyway, it's a homicide case and it
belongs to Rand. Go to the hospital.

168
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:25,094
- Can I ask around a bit?
- Don't do a thing.

169
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:28,268
You're skating on thin ice as it is.

170
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,022
We're talking about a friend of mine!

171
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:33,186
Yes, we are, aren't we?

172
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,400
Let's take a close look at that.

173
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:39,319
One, a hoodlum friend.
Two, a professional hit.

174
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:41,696
Three, in a cop's apartment.

175
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,491
This whole thing
stinks to high heaven.

176
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:49,327
- Why a professional hit?
- I didn't just walk into this town.

177
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:52,706
Whoever killed your friend
wasn't worried about you.

178
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:56,629
If they were, you'd be lying
beside him in that meat wagon.

179
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,967
Don't do a damn thing.
Stay out of this.

180
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:04,053
I'm owed some vacation time.
I want to take my vacation now.

181
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,309
Stay away from this case.

182
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:09,987
I just need a little vacation,
that's all.

183
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:17,438
All right, as soon as you finish
at the hospital, you're on vacation.

184
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,359
Thank you.

185
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:22,572
But if you decide
to butt into this case,

186
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:26,370
it'll be the longest vacation
you ever heard of.

187
00:20:56,475 --> 00:21:00,509
- Checking in today, sir?
- That depends. This hotel expensive?

188
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:04,187
Not for Beverly Hills.
Can I get your bags for you?

189
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:09,147
Yeah, that's my bag
in the front seat.

190
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:23,111
I'm sorry, sir, we just
have nothing available tonight.

191
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,740
I suggest next time
you call for a reservation

192
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:27,870
at least a week in advance.

193
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:30,051
Thank you.

194
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:32,413
- Hi.
- The nerve of some people!

195
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:33,915
May I help you?

196
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,211
You have a reservation
for Axel Foley.

197
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:38,383
Let's see.

198
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:42,843
I'm sorry, I don't see
anything under that name.

199
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:47,565
Check Rolling Stone Magazine's
Axel Foley, that's what it is.

200
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:54,396
No, no Rolling Stone, no Axel Foley.
I'm sorry, sir.

201
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,482
You probably just made a mistake.
Just give me another room.

202
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:02,155
Sorry, sir,
but there are none available.

203
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:08,619
Don't you think I realise what's
going on? Who do you think I am?

204
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:11,496
If I was some hotshot
from out of town

205
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,416
and you'd made a reservation mistake,
I'd be the first to get a room.

206
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,294
I'm not some hotshot, I'm
a small reporter from Rolling Stone,

207
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:22,796
here to do an interview
with Michael Jackson,

208
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,721
that's gonna be
in every major magazine.

209
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:29,391
I wanted to call it Jackson
Is Sitting On Top Of The World.

210
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:32,562
Now I'll call it
Jackson Can Sit On Top Of The World

211
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:36,270
But Not In The Beverly Palm Hotel
Cos There's No Niggers Allowed.

212
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:41,070
Excuse me, sir, it seems
we have a last-minute cancellation.

213
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:43,568
There is a room available, a suite,

214
00:22:43,672 --> 00:22:46,782
but I'll charge you
the single-room rate.

215
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:49,621
Thank you. I'm sorry,
it's probably jet lag.

216
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:51,831
- I understand.
- What's the rate?

217
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:54,049
That'll be $235 a night, sir.

218
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,893
Fine.

219
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:04,008
- That'll be suite 1035.
- Thank you very much.

220
00:23:04,113 --> 00:23:06,146
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

221
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:09,727
If Michael calls,
tell him what room I'm in.

222
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:10,874
Of course.

223
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,584
- How you are doing?
- Hi.

224
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:19,542
I'm fine. My name is Serge.
How can I help you?

225
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:21,884
I'm looking for Miss Jenny Summers.

226
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:26,884
It's very busy today.
You give me your name?

227
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:30,512
- My name's Axel Foley.
- What it's pertaining?

228
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:35,145
- I didn't understand.
- Pertaining, meaning, regarding...

229
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,940
Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance.

230
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,288
Donny.

231
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,287
One moment.

232
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:47,409
Donny, tell Miss Summers
that Ahmed Farley's here to...

233
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:50,624
- No, Axel Foley.
- Ahmel... Ahwell...

234
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:55,458
Foley's here,
he's an old acquaintance.

235
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:57,375
Cover this up.

236
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,713
It's like the breast of a dog
to scrub for the customer.

237
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:03,468
- It's not sexy, it's animal.
- Not sexy at all.

238
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:09,020
May I offer you something to drink?
Wine, cocktail, espresso?

239
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:10,971
No, thank you.

240
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:14,517
I make it myself, with a lemon twist.
You should try it.

241
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:17,063
No, I'm fine.

242
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:21,106
- I see you look at this piece.
- How much would it go for?

243
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,988
$130,000.

244
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:25,403
- Get the fuck outta here.
- No, I cannot.

245
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:27,738
It's a very important piece.

246
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:30,784
- Ever sold one of these?
- Yesterday.

247
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:35,122
- Get the fuck outta here.
- I'm serious. I sell it myself.

248
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:36,957
What are you doing here?

249
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:40,796
- How you doing?
- I'm fine. Hold on a second.

250
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,384
Great. Excuse me, Serge.

251
00:25:45,189 --> 00:25:48,052
- What are you doing here?
- How you doing?

252
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:50,720
It's good to see you.
How've you been?

253
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:52,851
- Look at you!
- You like?

254
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:55,183
Yeah. You're getting old.

255
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:56,936
Fuck you.

256
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,066
- What is this?
- A moustache.

257
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,857
- Peach fuzz.
- No, that's man style now.

258
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,988
You have someplace we can talk?

259
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:08,908
Yeah. Over there. Come on.

260
00:26:09,012 --> 00:26:11,536
- You've filled out.
- Yeah, I filled out.

261
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,664
No, it looks good, though.

262
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:15,637
Sit down.

263
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:21,097
- I want to talk about Mikey.
- Is he in trouble again?

264
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:26,440
He's dead.

265
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:29,568
What?

266
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,445
He came into Detroit
and somebody killed him.

267
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:38,114
I don't believe this.

268
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:51,462
Look, I can't right now.
I'll be up in a second.

269
00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:58,417
Mikey mentioned
that you helped him get a job.

270
00:26:58,522 --> 00:26:59,974
Yeah...

271
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:04,929
The guy who owns this gallery
hired him as a favour to me.

272
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:09,188
- Who's this guy?
- His name is Victor Maitland.

273
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:14,482
He was working for Victor
at the gallery's warehouse.

274
00:27:14,907 --> 00:27:17,030
I can't talk now,
I have to go upstairs.

275
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:19,357
That's cool.

276
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:23,360
I'll call you later on
and we'll get together and talk, OK?

277
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:24,507
Sure.

278
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:28,045
Be good.

279
00:27:36,428 --> 00:27:39,292
Hi. Delivery for Victor Maitland.

280
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:41,753
I'll take it upstairs to him.

281
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:44,004
Maybe I should give it to him myself.

282
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,173
Deliveries should be left here.

283
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:49,097
He has to get these flowers.
I'll go up myself.

284
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:51,223
You're not supposed to.

285
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:54,311
Floral delivery is my life.
I have to take it.

286
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:57,685
- Who let you in?
- I let myself in.

287
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,235
How you doing? I have some questions
about Michael Tandino.

288
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,037
Speak to you later, darling.

289
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:12,162
What, may I ask,
is your interest in Mr Tandino?

290
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:16,037
He was my best friend. He visited me
in Detroit a couple of days ago.

291
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:19,212
Soon after he got there,
someone killed him.

292
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:22,004
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

293
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:23,975
It's fucked up.

294
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,939
And? What do you wish to know?

295
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,138
- He worked for you, didn't he?
- Yes, yes, he did.

296
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:36,558
Good gracious!

297
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:40,148
I'm really sorry to hear this.
Would you like to sit down?

298
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:42,942
Can I get you anything?

299
00:28:43,046 --> 00:28:47,491
- No, I'm all right.
- How on earth did this happen?

300
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:50,338
Detroit is a very violent city,
isn't it?

301
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:54,661
Yeah.

302
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:59,427
I do hope the police have procured
some intelligent leads.

303
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:04,222
Exactly what did Mikey do for you?

304
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,727
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

305
00:29:09,524 --> 00:29:11,178
My name is Foley.

306
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,806
Excuse me, Mr Foley,
if I appear a little rude,

307
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,396
but this sounds like something
for the authorities in Detroit.

308
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,484
So, if you'll forgive me,
I must get back to work.

309
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:27,821
- All I want to know is...
- Please show Mr Foley to the door.

310
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:30,366
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, take it easy.

311
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,959
Get off me, man.
Get the fuck off me. Get off!

312
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,840
Get the fuck off me, man. Get off!

313
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:46,259
Get off me. Think I'm playing games?
I'm fucking somebody up.

314
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,029
What the fuck is this shit?

315
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:04,648
Did you see that?
I can describe them all.

316
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:07,279
Put your hands
on the hood of the car.

317
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:10,959
- What's with you guys?
- You heard him, sir. Do it now.

318
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:14,997
What kind of shit is this?
Wait a second.

319
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:18,500
You're arresting me
for getting thrown out of a window?

320
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:21,082
I got thrown out of a window, man!

321
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,222
Gun, partner!

322
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,173
Sir, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

323
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:29,886
Anything you say will be used
against you in court.

324
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,347
You have the right
to have an attorney.

325
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:34,475
I understand the rights.

326
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:37,479
This is bullshit.
I got thrown out of a window.

327
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:40,233
- Get in the car.
- What's the charge?

328
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:43,773
Possession of a concealed weapon
and disturbing the peace.

329
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:46,025
I got thrown out of a window!

330
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:49,532
What's the charge for getting
pushed out of a car, jaywalking?

331
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:51,454
This is bullshit!

332
00:30:58,387 --> 00:31:02,672
You know, this is the cleanest and
nicest police car I've ever been in.

333
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:04,806
It's nicer than my apartment.

334
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,639
Officers, if we see any movie stars
could you point them out to me?

335
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:16,768
That's enough talking.

336
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:19,023
OK, that's cool.

337
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:28,956
This is nice.

338
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,831
It's about time. I thought
you'd forgot me. I was hungry.

339
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:41,719
I've never seen a cell with a phone.
Could I stay cos I ordered pizza?

340
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:47,725
Somebody'll eat it.

341
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:11,037
Have a seat right over there, please.

342
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:21,503
I'm Sergeant Taggart and this
is my partner, Detective Rosewood.

343
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,726
Do you always treat visitors
from out of town like this?

344
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:30,803
Why didn't you say you were a police
officer when you were arrested?

345
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,808
Where do you get off
arresting somebody

346
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,101
for getting thrown out of a window?

347
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:39,060
Six witnesses say you started
tearing up the place,

348
00:32:39,164 --> 00:32:41,197
then jumped out the window.

349
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:45,193
You believe that? What the fuck
are you, cops or doormen?

350
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,946
We're more likely to believe
an important local businessman

351
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,074
than a foul-mouthed jerk.

352
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,495
Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man.

353
00:32:56,383 --> 00:33:00,247
- Watch your mouth.
- Don't square off on me.

354
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:03,016
- Don't push me.
- Fuck you, man.

355
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:05,644
Taggart!

356
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,975
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

357
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:27,874
Sir...

358
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,795
I apologise for striking you.

359
00:33:32,922 --> 00:33:35,247
I have no excuse.

360
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:39,621
Forget about it.

361
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:44,210
I am Lieutenant Bogomil of
the Beverly Hills Police Department.

362
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:48,254
Do you wish to file charges
against Sergeant Taggart?

363
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,175
Is this a joke?

364
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,724
Do you wish to file charges
against this officer for assault?

365
00:33:54,828 --> 00:33:59,474
Where I'm from, cops don't
file charges against other cops.

366
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,438
No, I don't want to do that.

367
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:06,065
In Beverly Hills,
we go strictly by the book.

368
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,028
Why didn't you inform us
when you came to town?

369
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,279
I'm on vacation.

370
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,453
Then why were you
in Victor Maitland's office?

371
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:18,131
I had to go to the bathroom.
It looked like a nice clean place.

372
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:25,671
- Always take your gun on vacation?
- Don't know. Never been on vacation.

373
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:28,714
But, in Detroit,
cops must always carry a firearm.

374
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,759
If you want to carry a gun,
go back there.

375
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,222
I really can't wait to get back.

376
00:34:34,326 --> 00:34:38,520
Is that so? I just spoke
to Inspector Todd in Detroit.

377
00:34:38,624 --> 00:34:40,856
Does that name ring a bell?

378
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:46,696
- He's my boss.
- You may not be welcome back.

379
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,574
He says you're
an outstanding young detective.

380
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,238
I find that difficult to believe.

381
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,159
It's true.

382
00:34:56,263 --> 00:35:00,469
He also says he nearly fired you.
I find that very easy to believe.

383
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,212
What are you doing here?

384
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:06,710
I'm on vacation.
I went to the bathroom

385
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:09,091
and six guys threw me out a window.

386
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:13,344
Inspector Todd gave me a message
for you. Wanna hear it?

387
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:14,491
No.

388
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,889
He says if you're here
investigating the Tandino murder,

389
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,141
don't bother coming back.

390
00:35:20,246 --> 00:35:23,565
If we inform him
you are working on this case,

391
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:25,700
he'll have you fired.

392
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,067
One last time, what are you doing?

393
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,197
I'm on vacation!

394
00:35:31,302 --> 00:35:32,871
Vacation.

395
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,034
Rosewood, take Mr Foley
over to the courthouse

396
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:39,581
and let him arrange for bail.

397
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:41,747
Follow me, sir.

398
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:46,140
I got to hand it to you guys,
you are extremely polite.

399
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:50,311
Pretty good punch you got, Taggart.

400
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,398
After you.

401
00:35:57,362 --> 00:35:59,447
After you.

402
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,028
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

403
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:05,566
Thanks for bailing me out, Jen.

404
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,487
If I'd known why you'd been arrested,
I wouldn't have come.

405
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:13,785
- You don't mean that.
- No, I don't mean that.

406
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:16,954
If it wasn't for Victor Maitland,
I'd be a waitress.

407
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:21,705
The day Mikey got killed, he showed
up with a bag of German bearer bonds.

408
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:24,667
I think he stole them
from whoever killed him.

409
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:28,212
When I mentioned Mikey's name,
Maitland threw me out.

410
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:33,594
You look like a hoodlum. You barge
into his office, carrying a gun.

411
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:36,888
If I didn't know you,
I'd throw you out.

412
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,807
Is this your car?

413
00:36:38,912 --> 00:36:41,852
No. In Beverly Hills
we just take the closest one.

414
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:47,566
I remember you used to drive
that crappy blue Chevy Nova.

415
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:49,901
What are you driving now?

416
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:53,075
The same crappy blue Chevy Nova.

417
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:56,449
Do you think it's too late
for me to study art?

418
00:36:56,553 --> 00:36:59,705
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

419
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:03,664
You don't think he has anything
to do with Mikey's death?

420
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:08,087
No, I was just poking around.
I don't think he did nothing.

421
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:13,311
Victor is one of the top art dealers
in the US, he has been for ten years.

422
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,856
I'm impressed.

423
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:23,980
- What are you looking at?
- The cops, they're following us.

424
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,579
What? Where?

425
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,664
In the back, on the right.
Beige Ford.

426
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,725
Can you believe this place?

427
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:04,188
How can you afford this?

428
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:06,732
They only charged me
the single-room rate.

429
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:09,315
- How can you afford that?
- I can't.

430
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:12,075
In the bathroom they got little robes

431
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:14,488
with the hotel's initials on it.

432
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,908
I love this place, I can't leave.

433
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:19,327
- I'm going to steal one. Want one?
- No.

434
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:22,759
You want some slippers?
I'm going to steal them, too.

435
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:25,386
Excuse me, two seconds.

436
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:32,968
Hello, room service?
This is Mr Axel Foley in suite 1035.

437
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:36,427
I'd like to order something
from your late supper menu.

438
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:39,601
I want you to deliver it
to this beige Ford on Wilshire.

439
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:44,074
Send down one bay shrimp
salad sandwich. OK?

440
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:48,774
Right. And is the cold poached salmon
in dill sauce tasty?

441
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:53,528
OK, send one of those down.
And send down something for dessert.

442
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,826
All right. Thank you.

443
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,953
You're quite a sport.

444
00:38:58,057 --> 00:39:00,828
How long are you going to stay?

445
00:39:00,933 --> 00:39:03,382
Until I find out who killed Mikey.

446
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:10,879
And I'm considering checking out
the warehouse where he worked.

447
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:14,228
Really?
How you planning on getting in?

448
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,073
- Good evening, sir.
- What is that?

449
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:39,870
Late supper,
compliments of Mr Axel Foley.

450
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:44,916
- Foley? How'd he know we were here?
- Because I let you drive.

451
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:47,378
I need a couple of bananas. How much?

452
00:39:47,482 --> 00:39:52,714
The buffet plate is $12.50. You get
peaches, plums, oranges and bananas.

453
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:55,768
All I need is a couple of bananas.

454
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:03,186
Go ahead, take those bananas.

455
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,359
Thank you.

456
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,774
- I'm not eating that. Take it back.
- Certainly.

457
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,911
This really looks great.

458
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:28,220
- Could I get some extra mayo?
- Certainly, sir.

459
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:31,426
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

460
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:35,813
There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

461
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:53,121
What the hell are you doing?

462
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:05,709
This the place?

463
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:08,713
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I should do this.

464
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:12,926
OK, but when you hear glass breaking,
don't get scared.

465
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,188
It's just me kicking in the window.
Sit tight.

466
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:19,856
All right. Come on, Axel.

467
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:45,802
- What's happening, baby?
- Grow up.

468
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,311
- Did you find something?
- Coffee grounds.

469
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:04,458
So?

470
00:42:05,534 --> 00:42:07,898
You know what this is used for?

471
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:10,358
People add hot water and drink it.

472
00:42:10,463 --> 00:42:14,785
I'll take this home, add hot water
and drink it in the morning.

473
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:31,256
What are we hiding for?

474
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:34,104
I wish you'd been with me last night.

475
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:39,179
- What happened?
- We stopped in a joint for a drink.

476
00:42:39,283 --> 00:42:41,316
- Which one?
- A local joint.

477
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:45,435
Some guy comes in,
sits a couple of stools away.

478
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,689
He's got one of them eyes
that's going like this.

479
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:53,028
I didn't know whether he was trying
to put the make on me.

480
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:55,405
I thought I'd take you there tonight,

481
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,168
let him have a shot at you
before I tore his head off.

482
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:12,005
Let's go. I want to get out of here.

483
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,222
- Just get off my back.
- Come on.

484
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:20,819
I got it.

485
00:43:37,379 --> 00:43:41,163
- What the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later.

486
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:43,370
Hurry up.

487
00:43:43,474 --> 00:43:45,954
- Give me the key.
- Ever driven a Mercedes?

488
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:48,795
A car's a car.
I drive mine every day.

489
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,758
- I'm driving, I've seen your car.
- Shit, that's cold.

490
00:44:00,528 --> 00:44:04,812
How could you not notice a man
sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

491
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:07,060
- He distracted us.
- How?

492
00:44:07,165 --> 00:44:10,816
He sent us a late supper.
This waiter comes over...

493
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,028
Billy, he gets the point.

494
00:44:13,132 --> 00:44:17,453
A late supper?
And what did you have, Rosewood?

495
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:23,497
I think it was
a shrimp salad sandwich, sir.

496
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:27,258
- A shrimp salad sandwich?
- Yes, sir.

497
00:44:29,975 --> 00:44:34,131
I want you two to go back
to the hotel and wait for Foley.

498
00:44:34,235 --> 00:44:37,842
If you lose him again,
don't bother calling in. Got that?

499
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:40,515
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:43,818
A late supper.

501
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:48,108
We've got something for you, Billy.

502
00:44:49,161 --> 00:44:51,912
An anti-banana disguise.

503
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:59,378
- It may come in handy.
- A little extra protection, Billy.

504
00:45:00,506 --> 00:45:02,546
Very funny.

505
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:05,678
Let's go.

506
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:24,817
- You take the car and go home.
- What about you?

507
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,771
I want to find out about this place.

508
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:30,020
It's a bonded warehouse.

509
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:33,861
They hold our foreign shipments
till they clear customs.

510
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,488
I'm going to check it out. Go home.

511
00:45:36,592 --> 00:45:40,531
Damn it, Axel.
I'm not going to bail you out again.

512
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:42,299
Go home.

513
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:41,650
How you doing?
Come here for a second, please.

514
00:46:43,613 --> 00:46:46,227
- Hi, you have a match?
- No smoking in here.

515
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:50,186
I'm going to smoke when
I go outside. Thank you very much.

516
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,522
- Is your supervisor here?
- In the office.

517
00:46:52,627 --> 00:46:54,736
- Will you get him?
- What's the problem?

518
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,986
You security?

519
00:46:56,091 --> 00:46:59,535
Then you're the fucking problem.
Get your supervisor. Now.

520
00:47:00,338 --> 00:47:01,380
Now!

521
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:02,840
OK.

522
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:12,297
He didn't come back yet.

523
00:47:14,936 --> 00:47:17,551
What do we do now?

524
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:19,316
We wait.

525
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:23,403
OK.

526
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,645
- Can I help you?
- Are you the supervisor?

527
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:29,897
- Yes. Who are you?
- Inspector Rafferty, US Customs.

528
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:33,568
- Has all this gone through customs?
- No, this is the bonded area.

529
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:37,360
Then tell me,
how can a black man, dressed like me,

530
00:47:37,464 --> 00:47:40,285
just march in and start poking around

531
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:43,049
without being asked any questions?

532
00:47:44,258 --> 00:47:46,917
- I don't know.
- That's the answer I wanted.

533
00:47:47,022 --> 00:47:50,419
Give me your ID numbers.
Somebody's going to lose their job.

534
00:47:50,523 --> 00:47:54,505
- He gave me a match.
- You gave him a match?

535
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:57,881
Listen. I do security checks
all over the nation.

536
00:47:57,986 --> 00:48:00,012
And apart from Cleveland,

537
00:48:00,116 --> 00:48:03,348
this place has the worst security
in the nation.

538
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:06,352
Call your wives
cos we'll be here all night.

539
00:48:06,457 --> 00:48:09,689
We're gonna check the background
of every crate,

540
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:11,778
starting with this one.

541
00:48:14,248 --> 00:48:19,032
It says here that by the time
the average American is 50,

542
00:48:19,136 --> 00:48:23,588
he's got five pounds
of undigested red meat in his bowels.

543
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:26,998
Why are you telling me this?

544
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:30,961
What makes you think
I have any interest in that at all?

545
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,555
Well, you eat a lot of red meat.

546
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:38,257
The inspector needs
the information on those bills.

547
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:40,221
All the manifests, too.

548
00:48:40,325 --> 00:48:43,930
And records of all shipments
due into the same destination.

549
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:46,265
- What's this about?
- Just do it.

550
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:49,144
You got a warrant for this?

551
00:48:49,248 --> 00:48:53,776
You have a very big mouth, sir.
Are you hiding something from me?

552
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,196
I bet that's your Porsche outside.
Is it?

553
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,743
Would you like me to have the IRS
crawl up your ass with a microscope?

554
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:04,995
It's not pretty.
I want you to know something.

555
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,747
I want you all to know, I could
have 25 agents here in 15 minutes,

556
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:14,170
to march in here, snatch your bond
and you'd be out of business,

557
00:49:14,274 --> 00:49:16,383
if you don't cooperate. Understood?

558
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:19,148
We'll give you everything you need.

559
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:23,015
- Everything you need.
- That's not my Porsche, sir.

560
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,322
You've nothing to worry about, then.
You all take me for a fool. Hurry!

561
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:38,161
I notice you've been drinking
a lot of coffee lately.

562
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:43,461
I think that's why
you have a hard time relaxing.

563
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:07,310
Jesus Christ!
You almost gave me a heart attack.

564
00:50:07,414 --> 00:50:11,562
- What are you doing here so late?
- You're a cocky son of a bitch.

565
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,524
If you're still mad
about the banana, I'm sorry.

566
00:50:14,628 --> 00:50:16,692
I needed some time to myself.

567
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:20,737
I wish I'd seen your face
when the car conked out.

568
00:50:20,841 --> 00:50:23,912
Very funny. The lieutenant
docked us two days' pay.

569
00:50:24,016 --> 00:50:26,046
Get outta here!

570
00:50:28,636 --> 00:50:32,136
- He's not kidding.
- No, he's not kidding.

571
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:35,555
By the way, thanks for the sandwich.

572
00:50:36,352 --> 00:50:38,550
It was a joke, like the bananas.

573
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:44,724
I know what it's like on a stakeout.
That food was from the heart.

574
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:46,697
Bullshit!

575
00:50:47,323 --> 00:50:51,367
Why are we always arguing? We're all
cops. We should work together.

576
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:53,689
We've all had a rough day.

577
00:50:53,794 --> 00:50:58,615
What do you say we go get something
to drink, make up and be friends?

578
00:50:59,418 --> 00:51:01,503
Forget it.

579
00:51:01,837 --> 00:51:06,909
OK, fuck it. I'm going to get
a drink. Follow me if you want.

580
00:51:07,013 --> 00:51:09,917
But I lost you once, I can again.

581
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:13,707
Why don't we get something
to drink together? Let's be friends.

582
00:51:13,812 --> 00:51:17,299
- We don't drink on duty.
- OK. Fine.

583
00:51:17,404 --> 00:51:21,802
But listen. I found
the perfect place. I saw it today.

584
00:51:21,906 --> 00:51:26,268
It's perfect for you. It's
very conservative. You'll love it.

585
00:51:26,372 --> 00:51:28,818
It's nice. Trust me.

586
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:55,502
- Hi. Can I get you something?
- Yes!

587
00:51:55,606 --> 00:51:59,841
Can I have a Scotch and soda?
What do you want?

588
00:51:59,945 --> 00:52:02,940
- Light beers for them.
- Two club sodas.

589
00:52:04,193 --> 00:52:07,517
You crack me up
with this "on duty" shit.

590
00:52:07,622 --> 00:52:11,658
Billy, you don't have to be
embarrassed if your dick is hard.

591
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:15,981
Your dick is supposed to get hard.
That's the whole object.

592
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:19,238
Taggart's dick is hard,
but he won't say. He's the boss.

593
00:52:19,343 --> 00:52:21,282
Boss's dick got to stay limp.

594
00:52:21,386 --> 00:52:24,379
I ain't on duty
so my dick can be hard.

595
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,131
Taggart, look. I found that
at Maitland's warehouse.

596
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:33,712
- Billy! Give her this.
- No.

597
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:36,380
Stuff that in her thing.
She'll go nuts.

598
00:52:36,852 --> 00:52:38,891
Excuse me.

599
00:52:40,647 --> 00:52:41,898
Billy.

600
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:47,725
- What do you think?
- Coffee grounds. So?

601
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:52,312
You guys don't know nothing
about nothing, do you?

602
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:56,538
Make sure we get the right drinks.
I drink club soda, I'll throw up.

603
00:52:56,831 --> 00:53:00,081
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

604
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:25,473
- She likes you.
- Think so?

605
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,443
No doubt.

606
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:32,447
Taggart... See that guy
over there in the black coat?

607
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:37,194
- Black jacket?
- Yeah.

608
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:40,575
It's June.
Isn't it hot for a long leather coat?

609
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,491
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.

610
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,043
Look at his partner.
They just came in.

611
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,748
Something's getting ready to go down.

612
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:55,043
- Go and cover that guy.
- What's going on?

613
00:53:55,148 --> 00:54:00,213
I'll check out this asshole at the
bar. Billy will make sure I behave.

614
00:54:00,317 --> 00:54:03,398
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

615
00:54:07,362 --> 00:54:09,401
No bullshit this time.

616
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:15,276
Just sit tight, Billy.

617
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:43,774
Philip!

618
00:54:44,275 --> 00:54:46,972
Man, what's happening, Phil?

619
00:54:47,077 --> 00:54:52,027
He said you don't come here no more,
but I said, "It's Phil".

620
00:54:52,616 --> 00:54:55,231
- Get out of here, man.
- I told you!

621
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:58,283
- Give me a kiss, baby.
- I said get outta here!

622
00:55:00,959 --> 00:55:03,331
Everybody freeze!

623
00:55:03,837 --> 00:55:05,868
Turn around. Turn around!

624
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:09,039
- Phil!
- Keep your hands on the table!

625
00:55:09,143 --> 00:55:11,875
What's wrong?
What's all the hostility?

626
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,917
- Get back.
- What's all this gun, man?

627
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:17,046
You changed.

628
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,218
Get back or I'll
blow your brains out.

629
00:55:22,814 --> 00:55:24,973
Police. Move and I'll kill you.

630
00:55:25,984 --> 00:55:28,607
Don't move! Turn over!

631
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:33,021
Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some cop. You know that?

632
00:55:33,126 --> 00:55:37,578
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything's under control.

633
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:49,209
Taggart.

634
00:55:50,385 --> 00:55:54,041
Would you explain why
you and Rosewood were in a strip bar

635
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:56,963
out of our jurisdiction
while you were on duty?

636
00:55:57,067 --> 00:56:01,299
Before you chastise these officers,
there's something you should know.

637
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:06,846
The only reason they were at a strip
bar is because they were tailing me.

638
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,807
They were outside
wondering what I was doing.

639
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:13,274
I was in having a good time.
I'm into those things.

640
00:56:13,993 --> 00:56:17,522
These guys waited outside
and the only reason they came in

641
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:22,367
was because they saw two men with
bulges in their jackets going in.

642
00:56:23,043 --> 00:56:25,907
Well, these guys
were going to commit a robbery.

643
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:30,373
They watched them, waited for them to
make their move, then foiled a crime.

644
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:33,460
I did not know what was going on.

645
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:36,630
I'm freaked out.
They must have a sixth sense.

646
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:41,631
I don't know what you teach them,
but they're not just regular cops.

647
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,550
They're supercops.

648
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:46,733
The only thing missing
on these guys are capes.

649
00:56:50,113 --> 00:56:52,782
Is this what really happened?

650
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:56,161
No, sir.

651
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:58,908
Would someone tell me what happened?

652
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,418
Well...

653
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:07,950
Foley invited us to this bar.
We accepted.

654
00:57:08,054 --> 00:57:10,995
- We ordered club sodas, sir.
- Right.

655
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,752
And while we were there,

656
00:57:13,856 --> 00:57:16,126
Foley observed the two suspects

657
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:18,255
casing the establishment.

658
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:21,426
And before we knew what was going on,

659
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:24,438
he'd already disarmed one of them.

660
00:57:25,566 --> 00:57:30,222
Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrests, sir.

661
00:57:30,326 --> 00:57:34,606
Detective Foley,
we appreciate your assistance,

662
00:57:34,711 --> 00:57:37,399
but if you want to practise
law enforcement,

663
00:57:37,503 --> 00:57:40,247
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.

664
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,864
I understand. I'm sorry.

665
00:57:43,968 --> 00:57:46,740
But before I go
I want you two to know,

666
00:57:46,845 --> 00:57:49,329
the supercops story was working.

667
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:55,415
OK? It was working
and you guys just messed it up.

668
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,047
I'm trying to figure you guys out,
but I haven't yet. But it's cool.

669
00:58:00,152 --> 00:58:03,643
Just fuck up a perfectly good lie
and it's all right.

670
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:12,851
You guys are off the case.

671
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:16,567
Foster, McCabe, your turn.

672
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:21,782
- Don't lose him.
- Not a chance, sir.

673
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:26,030
And you two...

674
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:28,168
In my office.

675
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:48,478
Morning, gentlemen.
Coffee and doughnuts?

676
00:58:49,486 --> 00:58:52,440
- What?
- Coffee and doughnuts.

677
00:58:57,661 --> 00:58:59,903
There he is.

678
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:18,849
Morning, officers.
You the second team?

679
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:22,049
We're the first team.

680
00:59:22,153 --> 00:59:24,676
We won't fall
for a banana in the tailpipe.

681
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,052
You won't fall
for the banana in the tailpipe?

682
00:59:28,156 --> 00:59:30,976
It should be more natural,
brother, like this.

683
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,310
"I ain't falling for no banana in my
tailpipe." It's more natural for us.

684
00:59:35,415 --> 00:59:39,074
You've been hanging out
with this dude too long.

685
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:43,788
I'm sorry, I'm just fucking with you.
That's funny to me.

686
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:48,031
- You gonna try to keep up with me?
- No problem.

687
00:59:48,136 --> 00:59:51,914
- Isn't this Victor Maitland's house?
- Yeah, I think so.

688
00:59:54,512 --> 00:59:57,587
I've seen enough.
You want something to drink?

689
00:59:57,691 --> 00:59:59,962
I got some stuff in the trunk.

690
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:02,098
Excuse me.

691
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:16,936
For a man on vacation,
you look like you're on a stakeout.

692
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,863
Stakeout? No, no. I'm picnicking.
This is a picnic area.

693
01:00:29,423 --> 01:00:32,498
I've been shooting the shit
long enough.

694
01:00:32,602 --> 01:00:35,677
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.

695
01:01:27,107 --> 01:01:29,147
What the hell's he doing?

696
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,407
Can you put this in a good spot?

697
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:33,590
This shit happened
last time I parked here.

698
01:03:01,204 --> 01:03:03,607
May I help you?

699
01:03:03,711 --> 01:03:06,624
I'm looking for Victor Maitland.

700
01:03:07,419 --> 01:03:10,116
You realise that
this is a members only club?

701
01:03:10,221 --> 01:03:13,205
I have to talk to Victor.
It's very important.

702
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:16,208
- Victor Maitland, are you sure?
- Yes.

703
01:03:16,312 --> 01:03:19,839
Grey-haired gentleman.
Very dark skin. Capricorn.

704
01:03:20,892 --> 01:03:24,383
Why don't you give me the message
and I'll take it to him?

705
01:03:24,487 --> 01:03:29,679
OK. Tell Victor that Ramon,
the fella he met about a week ago...

706
01:03:29,783 --> 01:03:32,722
Tell him that
Ramon went to the clinic,

707
01:03:32,827 --> 01:03:35,850
and I found out that I have...

708
01:03:35,955 --> 01:03:37,980
herpes simplex 10.

709
01:03:38,084 --> 01:03:41,522
I think Victor should check himself
out with his physician

710
01:03:41,626 --> 01:03:44,575
before things start falling off
on the man.

711
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:49,626
Perhaps you better tell him that.

712
01:03:51,924 --> 01:03:55,838
- I think that would be best.
- So do I.

713
01:04:11,443 --> 01:04:13,483
Hi, Victor.

714
01:04:15,656 --> 01:04:17,533
I'm back.

715
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:26,157
Look, guys, don't even try it.

716
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,657
Why don't you
get the hell out of here?

717
01:04:29,762 --> 01:04:32,126
Get the fuck away from me, man.

718
01:04:48,356 --> 01:04:52,687
Very good, Victor. Could you teach
him to roll over and sit, too?

719
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:56,602
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

720
01:04:56,706 --> 01:05:00,779
- Last time, I didn't get the chance.
- I've nothing to say to you.

721
01:05:01,162 --> 01:05:03,617
That's cool, I'll do all the talking.

722
01:05:04,874 --> 01:05:07,246
This is a very nice place, Vic.

723
01:05:07,835 --> 01:05:10,587
Hi. I like this. This is nice.

724
01:05:11,505 --> 01:05:14,590
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.

725
01:05:17,136 --> 01:05:21,626
Victor, I know that you're into
a lot of crooked shit.

726
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:25,171
And I have a pretty good idea
that you had Mikey killed.

727
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:28,095
And when I find out for sure,

728
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:30,343
I'm going to fuck you up real bad.

729
01:05:30,447 --> 01:05:32,473
Is that so?

730
01:05:32,577 --> 01:05:35,766
Now listen to me,
my tough little friend.

731
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:39,726
I don't know
from under what stone you crawled

732
01:05:39,831 --> 01:05:43,273
or where you get
these ridiculous ideas about me,

733
01:05:43,377 --> 01:05:45,857
but it seems painfully obvious

734
01:05:45,962 --> 01:05:48,527
you haven't
the slightest fucking idea

735
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:50,947
who you're dealing with.

736
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:54,288
Now, my advice to you

737
01:05:54,392 --> 01:05:57,663
is crawl back to your little stone
in Detroit

738
01:05:57,767 --> 01:06:01,297
before you get squashed, OK?

739
01:06:01,808 --> 01:06:05,132
- Please step away from the table.
- Gotta go now, Vic.

740
01:06:05,236 --> 01:06:08,348
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.

741
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:16,236
Catch you later, Vic.

742
01:06:17,115 --> 01:06:19,154
I can't wait.

743
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,005
Don't I know you guys?
You look so familiar.

744
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:40,960
Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

745
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:44,141
Why are you bothering
Victor Maitland?

746
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:51,010
I had a friend, Michael Tandino,
who used to work for him.

747
01:06:51,114 --> 01:06:55,569
Maitland had him killed. When I can
prove it you'll be the first to know.

748
01:06:57,949 --> 01:07:00,736
Forget what you can prove,
talk to me.

749
01:07:03,663 --> 01:07:08,153
OK. Listen. Everybody knows Victor
Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.

750
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:11,448
But I poked around.
Art's not the only thing he deals.

751
01:07:11,552 --> 01:07:14,287
I saw some guys in his warehouse

752
01:07:14,392 --> 01:07:16,619
unloading a crate
of German bearer bonds.

753
01:07:16,723 --> 01:07:20,625
Michael Tandino had bonds
like this on him, coincidentally,

754
01:07:20,729 --> 01:07:22,753
when he was killed.

755
01:07:22,857 --> 01:07:25,629
Just because Maitland invests
in the same bonds

756
01:07:25,733 --> 01:07:27,758
doesn't mean he's a killer.

757
01:07:27,862 --> 01:07:30,885
The man's not an investor,
he's a smuggler,

758
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:33,053
be it bonds, drugs or whatever.

759
01:07:33,157 --> 01:07:36,227
The crate I saw
didn't even pass through customs.

760
01:07:36,331 --> 01:07:38,936
Maitland is paying
to get his shipments out

761
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,853
before they're inspected.

762
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:45,403
When his guys get it, they take
the drugs or bonds out of the crates

763
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:49,626
and they send it back before customs
even knows what's going on.

764
01:07:51,462 --> 01:07:55,408
- And you witnessed this?
- Everything except for the drugs.

765
01:07:55,512 --> 01:07:57,750
But I found coffee grounds
everywhere.

766
01:07:58,928 --> 01:08:02,375
- Coffee grounds?
- What does that mean?

767
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:05,760
Drugs are packed in coffee.
The scent throws off the dogs.

768
01:08:06,436 --> 01:08:09,223
Very good. Now what do we do?

769
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:12,730
Look, Detective Foley, I...

770
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,064
I'm sorry.
I'd really like to help you.

771
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:20,645
If you'd found the drugs,
that's one thing,

772
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:24,860
but if your only evidence is coffee,
we can't get a search warrant.

773
01:08:24,964 --> 01:08:26,986
We can get around that.

774
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:30,249
We don't "get around"
search warrants.

775
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:35,578
Taggart, I want you
to start checking this out.

776
01:08:35,682 --> 01:08:38,954
Start with the LAPD,
the FBI and the Customs Service.

777
01:08:39,058 --> 01:08:43,087
Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.

778
01:08:43,192 --> 01:08:45,463
We snoop around, he'll close down

779
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:48,174
and get his shipments from elsewhere.

780
01:08:48,278 --> 01:08:52,305
Really? Is that what your
extensive experience tells you?

781
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:55,436
I haven't been on the force...

782
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:57,989
Shit.

783
01:08:59,324 --> 01:09:02,075
- Is this the man?
- Yes, sir.

784
01:09:03,203 --> 01:09:07,321
The gentleman that crashed
through Victor Maitland's window?

785
01:09:07,425 --> 01:09:11,195
Who disabled an unmarked unit
with a banana?

786
01:09:11,299 --> 01:09:12,698
Yes, sir.

787
01:09:12,803 --> 01:09:15,871
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont

788
01:09:15,976 --> 01:09:19,662
into a gross dereliction of duty

789
01:09:19,766 --> 01:09:22,670
at a striptease establishment?

790
01:09:22,774 --> 01:09:25,167
It's Rosewood, sir.

791
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:27,144
Yes, sir.

792
01:09:27,394 --> 01:09:29,963
Is this the gentleman
who ruined the buffet

793
01:09:30,068 --> 01:09:31,890
at the Harrow Club today?

794
01:09:33,025 --> 01:09:34,641
Yes, sir.

795
01:09:34,745 --> 01:09:39,612
I just bet you are the pride
of your department in Detroit.

796
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:47,694
Lieutenant,
I'd like to see you in your office.

797
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:49,668
Yes, sir.

798
01:09:53,004 --> 01:09:57,788
Is this the man who wrecked the
buffet at the Harrow Club today?

799
01:09:57,892 --> 01:10:01,751
- Lower your voice.
- Can he hear me through the wall?

800
01:10:02,263 --> 01:10:04,303
Yes, he can.

801
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:25,855
Rosewood, take Detective Foley
back to his hotel room,

802
01:10:25,959 --> 01:10:27,986
watch him pack,

803
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,945
and escort him to the city limits.

804
01:10:31,049 --> 01:10:33,415
Then you can give him his gun back.

805
01:10:34,922 --> 01:10:39,495
The two charges of disturbing the
peace have been dropped against you.

806
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,080
But if you return to Beverly Hills,

807
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:44,417
the charges will be reinstated

808
01:10:44,521 --> 01:10:48,046
and you will be prosecuted
to the limit of the law.

809
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,842
- Sir, may I say something?
- What?

810
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:53,009
He seems to have enough...

811
01:10:53,113 --> 01:10:55,516
You want to tell that to the chief?

812
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:59,939
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

813
01:11:01,575 --> 01:11:03,900
Come on, Axel.

814
01:11:21,637 --> 01:11:25,250
Right. Let me check on that tomorrow
and get back to you.

815
01:11:25,355 --> 01:11:27,419
Thank you.

816
01:11:27,524 --> 01:11:29,677
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.

817
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:34,435
- Sit down. I'm not interrupting?
- Of course not.

818
01:11:35,234 --> 01:11:37,682
There's a gentleman in town
from Detroit

819
01:11:37,786 --> 01:11:40,899
who says he's a friend
of Michael Tandino.

820
01:11:41,659 --> 01:11:46,398
He came by the office yesterday and
asked me all sorts of odd questions.

821
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,317
Excuse me, darling.

822
01:11:48,422 --> 01:11:50,901
I believe his name is Foley.

823
01:11:51,005 --> 01:11:53,154
Since you were a friend of Michael,

824
01:11:53,259 --> 01:11:56,533
I was wondering
if you knew the fellow.

825
01:11:56,637 --> 01:11:59,540
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.

826
01:11:59,644 --> 01:12:01,960
Really? Have you seen him lately?

827
01:12:03,847 --> 01:12:05,887
He came in yesterday.

828
01:12:06,642 --> 01:12:09,097
What? He came by here?

829
01:12:11,773 --> 01:12:12,816
And?

830
01:12:14,776 --> 01:12:18,109
He told me that Mikey
had been killed.

831
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:21,611
Yes. Yes, I know.

832
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:27,316
- And then?
- That's it.

833
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:31,246
He left and I haven't seen him since.

834
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:36,449
Jenny, darling,
do you know where he's staying?

835
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:40,213
I have some information
which might be helpful for him.

836
01:12:43,597 --> 01:12:45,804
No, I have no idea.

837
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:57,304
I hope I didn't disturb you.

838
01:12:57,408 --> 01:13:00,487
- No problem.
- We'll have dinner soon, yes?

839
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:03,946
- That'd be lovely.
- Take care.

840
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:20,960
I read the manifests. They're
expecting another shipment in today.

841
01:13:22,054 --> 01:13:23,457
Bogomil...

842
01:13:23,561 --> 01:13:27,878
This is a chance for me and you
to blow this case wide open.

843
01:13:27,982 --> 01:13:30,257
I wish I could, but I can't.

844
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:31,404
Why?

845
01:13:32,272 --> 01:13:34,680
Because Bogomil would kill me.

846
01:13:39,696 --> 01:13:42,726
I'm not going to drive you
to the art gallery.

847
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:46,566
It's easy. Jenny will let us in
Maitland's warehouse.

848
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:48,861
The shipment arrives, we nail them.

849
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:52,197
- How can you be sure it'll be drugs?
- I got a hunch.

850
01:13:52,301 --> 01:13:57,410
A technique by which many crimes
outside Beverly Hills get solved.

851
01:13:57,514 --> 01:14:00,582
Why didn't you tell Bogomil
about this shipment?

852
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:05,460
He does everything by the book.
Is everybody in this town a robot?

853
01:14:05,565 --> 01:14:08,427
This thing is very personal to me.

854
01:14:10,269 --> 01:14:13,721
All he asked me to do
was drive you out of town.

855
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:17,395
Now I'm going to screw that up, too.

856
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:24,156
Billy, I love you.
I just fell in love with you.

857
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,194
Jenny, how are you?

858
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,236
This is my buddy Billy Rosewood.
Jenny Summers.

859
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,531
- Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

860
01:14:35,635 --> 01:14:37,616
That's Serge.

861
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,578
Can you get my friend an espresso?

862
01:14:40,682 --> 01:14:43,083
You want it with a lemon twist?

863
01:14:44,722 --> 01:14:46,920
Sure, if it's no bother.

864
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,758
No, don't be stupid.

865
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:53,427
Victor Maitland was here
asking questions about you today.

866
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,887
He was acting real weird.

867
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:59,151
Look, I want to get back
inside the warehouse.

868
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:01,977
How about I go with you?

869
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:05,397
You work in a gallery.
You're not a cop.

870
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:09,816
If this has to do with Mikey's death,
I want to check it out.

871
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:12,037
I don't have time to argue with you.

872
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:16,872
Let me get my keys
and we'll argue on the way.

873
01:15:20,509 --> 01:15:24,416
Billy, you sit here and observe.
Don't move till I get you.

874
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:28,631
- Why can't I come in?
- Cos you're a cop in this town.

875
01:15:28,735 --> 01:15:31,923
Without probable cause,
it's an illegal search.

876
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,635
Didn't they teach you that
in cop school?

877
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:38,139
- I find some evidence, I'll get you.
- You can't...

878
01:15:38,244 --> 01:15:44,190
Be cool, all right? If anything
jumps off, I'll come and get you.

879
01:15:45,326 --> 01:15:48,733
Is there any chance
you'll let me go in by myself?

880
01:15:48,838 --> 01:15:50,870
No chance.

881
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:54,284
Fuck. Come on.

882
01:16:40,258 --> 01:16:43,749
- Seems they've been already.
- What are you looking for?

883
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:44,896
This.

884
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:48,963
A crate from overseas that
hasn't passed through customs yet.

885
01:16:58,193 --> 01:17:00,519
What is that?

886
01:17:10,873 --> 01:17:12,110
Coffee?

887
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:14,449
Yeah, it's coffee on top.

888
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:23,331
But this ain't sugar.
Go get Rosewood.

889
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:25,717
Welcome to the party.

890
01:17:50,205 --> 01:17:52,577
It seems we have guests.

891
01:18:13,104 --> 01:18:16,852
How nice. I do like surprises.

892
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,244
Jeannette.

893
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:39,045
I just can't tell you how
disappointed I am to find you here.

894
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:41,967
Shut up!

895
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,590
I don't want to hear it.

896
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:06,193
Take her to the car and wait for me.

897
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:09,648
What are you going to do with him?

898
01:19:09,752 --> 01:19:14,030
You should be more worried about
what we're going to do with you.

899
01:19:14,134 --> 01:19:18,159
Don't worry. We've got cocaine and
coffee, we're going to have a party.

900
01:19:18,263 --> 01:19:21,867
Thanks for having me over, Vic.
This is very nice.

901
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:23,793
Did you say something?

902
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:41,438
If something happens to her...

903
01:19:43,113 --> 01:19:45,153
I'm all ears.

904
01:19:46,575 --> 01:19:48,615
I'll kill you.

905
01:19:49,745 --> 01:19:53,161
Really? That would be a neat trick.

906
01:20:05,345 --> 01:20:09,295
- Well, cuz.
- Are you still pissed at me?

907
01:20:12,394 --> 01:20:17,980
No. But I should have
taken care of you in Detroit.

908
01:20:23,947 --> 01:20:26,354
When I popped your little buddy.

909
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:35,449
Goodbye, Mr Foley.

910
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:40,456
- Have a nice day.
- I'll try.

911
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:07,784
Damn it.

912
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:12,247
Oh, boy.

913
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:28,291
How's that little bump
on the head I gave you in Detroit?

914
01:21:28,396 --> 01:21:30,677
Healed up nice, I hope.

915
01:21:56,459 --> 01:21:57,704
Freeze!

916
01:22:11,183 --> 01:22:12,226
Thanks.

917
01:22:27,533 --> 01:22:32,150
Tell Taggart to check out
the warehouse. I'll explain later.

918
01:22:32,254 --> 01:22:35,237
Sergeant Taggart is here,
he wants to talk to you.

919
01:22:35,342 --> 01:22:36,363
Shit!

920
01:22:36,468 --> 01:22:39,364
Billy, what the hell is going on?

921
01:22:39,469 --> 01:22:43,535
- Sorry, Sarge, I can't talk now.
- What do you mean?

922
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:48,289
Just check out the warehouse and
please don't say anything to Bogomil.

923
01:22:48,393 --> 01:22:50,957
- He's not transmitting any more.
- Shit.

924
01:22:51,061 --> 01:22:55,425
- What's the matter?
- Billy's doing something dumb again.

925
01:22:55,529 --> 01:22:59,177
- Was he calling from the hotel?
- No, sir.

926
01:22:59,281 --> 01:23:02,681
Right now, his car's heading north
on Palm Canyon Road.

927
01:23:02,786 --> 01:23:06,390
- We were there this morning.
- What?

928
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:08,937
Foley was looking over
Maitland's house.

929
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:12,735
- Do you have that warehouse address?
- Yes, sir.

930
01:23:13,956 --> 01:23:18,823
Check that place out, let me know
what's going on over there.

931
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:20,959
Don't talk to anybody but me.

932
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:45,305
Hold it, Foley. You're under arrest.
Billy, why are you here?

933
01:23:45,409 --> 01:23:48,313
- I forced him at gunpoint.
- No, he didn't.

934
01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:52,904
Everything he said about Maitland
is right. He's kidnapped a woman.

935
01:23:54,664 --> 01:23:57,611
- Let's get her.
- What do you think I'm doing?

936
01:23:57,715 --> 01:24:01,994
- We'll have a warrant in 20 minutes.
- She could be dead in 20 minutes.

937
01:24:02,098 --> 01:24:04,120
Stop. You're coming with us.

938
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:07,715
I'm going inside.
You want to stop me, shoot me.

939
01:24:10,389 --> 01:24:14,335
Me, too. You can do what you want,
but I'm going in.

940
01:24:14,439 --> 01:24:16,838
This is really serious trouble.

941
01:24:16,942 --> 01:24:19,762
If you're lucky,
you'll just get fired.

942
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:22,942
- Got it.
- This is my last warning.

943
01:24:31,035 --> 01:24:33,158
I'm sorry, Sarge. I've got to.

944
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:40,253
Shit. Wait a minute.

945
01:24:53,934 --> 01:24:57,758
- What's that?
- Looks like East Gate.

946
01:24:57,862 --> 01:24:59,894
Punch it up.

947
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:07,405
Who the hell is that?
Better get Maitland up here.

948
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:27,082
Where is everybody? Is Rosewood back?

949
01:25:27,186 --> 01:25:29,624
- No, sir.
- Seen Taggart?

950
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,010
He took off about 10 minutes ago.

951
01:25:41,066 --> 01:25:43,097
Foley's on the grounds.

952
01:25:43,201 --> 01:25:47,737
How the hell should I know?
Get some people out there right away.

953
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:53,030
Don't take your eyes off that screen.

954
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:26,066
Try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.

955
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:38,875
Come on.

956
01:27:02,442 --> 01:27:07,264
- They must be away from the car.
- I can see that. Keep trying.

957
01:27:07,368 --> 01:27:10,448
- DD-13, come in please.
- What's their 20?

958
01:27:14,454 --> 01:27:16,274
609 Palm Canyon Road.

959
01:27:16,378 --> 01:27:18,828
Who lives at that address?

960
01:27:21,962 --> 01:27:24,002
A Victor Maitland, sir.

961
01:27:27,217 --> 01:27:31,630
- Let's go around.
- Come on, we can do it. Come on.

962
01:27:37,061 --> 01:27:39,630
Ready, one, two...

963
01:27:39,734 --> 01:27:40,981
three!

964
01:28:11,221 --> 01:28:13,260
You all right?

965
01:28:16,434 --> 01:28:18,676
What the fuck am I doing here?

966
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:26,737
Drop it!

967
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:38,077
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let's go.

968
01:28:48,759 --> 01:28:51,584
- Jesus Christ!
- These guys are serious.

969
01:28:51,688 --> 01:28:54,134
I hate machine guns.

970
01:29:02,774 --> 01:29:04,651
Cover me.

971
01:29:17,831 --> 01:29:20,915
Go around front.
I'm going to check the back.

972
01:29:22,586 --> 01:29:27,997
We have a report of shots fired at
that location. 609 Palm Canyon Road.

973
01:29:28,102 --> 01:29:30,917
Put out a 998,
officers need assistance.

974
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:33,043
- Undercovers on scene.
- Sir?

975
01:29:33,147 --> 01:29:38,045
I want all north end units to roll.
South end units stay in their area.

976
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:41,809
- Damn! Let's go.
- Undercover officers at location.

977
01:29:50,865 --> 01:29:53,190
Police! You're all under arrest!

978
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:02,115
Do that again, I'll shoot you myself.

979
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:17,280
Know what I keep thinking about?

980
01:31:17,913 --> 01:31:20,535
Know the end of Butch Cassidy?

981
01:31:22,626 --> 01:31:26,126
Redford and Newman
are almost out of ammunition.

982
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:32,511
And the whole Bolivian army
is out in front of this little hut.

983
01:31:36,933 --> 01:31:39,685
I'm going to make you pay for this.

984
01:32:58,642 --> 01:33:00,516
- Hanging around?
- Fuck, no.

985
01:33:28,256 --> 01:33:30,712
Freeze it! Hold it right there.

986
01:33:33,928 --> 01:33:34,971
Shit!

987
01:33:53,532 --> 01:33:56,237
Be careful, old boy,
it might hit me.

988
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,420
Freeze!

989
01:34:24,398 --> 01:34:27,261
Police! You're all under arrest!

990
01:34:27,365 --> 01:34:33,148
Lay down your weapons and take
two steps back with your hands up!

991
01:34:38,286 --> 01:34:40,319
Very good.

992
01:34:40,423 --> 01:34:41,466
Great.

993
01:35:00,727 --> 01:35:02,841
What the hell's going on here?

994
01:35:02,945 --> 01:35:03,988
Shit.

995
01:35:04,188 --> 01:35:08,095
- What's this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.

996
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:11,140
How come he isn't wearing cuffs?

997
01:35:11,244 --> 01:35:14,395
Well, he isn't actually
in custody, sir.

998
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,233
Place him in custody.
Or would you like me to?

999
01:35:17,337 --> 01:35:20,613
Wouldn't you like to hear
my report first, sir?

1000
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:25,781
You have a report
that explains all this?

1001
01:35:25,885 --> 01:35:27,755
Yes, sir.

1002
01:35:28,338 --> 01:35:31,209
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

1003
01:35:34,386 --> 01:35:38,210
Miss Jeannette Summers, the manager
of Mr Maitland's art gallery,

1004
01:35:38,314 --> 01:35:42,047
accidentally discovered
what she suspected was cocaine

1005
01:35:42,151 --> 01:35:43,966
in the gallery's warehouse.

1006
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:48,560
She immediately communicated her
discovery to Detective Axel Foley.

1007
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:52,848
Detective Foley was, at the time,

1008
01:35:52,953 --> 01:35:57,853
cooperating in a joint
Beverly Hills-Detroit investigation.

1009
01:35:57,958 --> 01:36:02,275
Detectives Foley and Rosewood
proceeded to the warehouse

1010
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:06,241
where Rosewood discovered
approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.

1011
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:11,798
Rosewood called for back-up
and I despatched our officers.

1012
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:15,256
Sergeant Taggart
was the first on the scene.

1013
01:36:16,055 --> 01:36:20,672
Believing a felony was in progress,
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood,

1014
01:36:20,776 --> 01:36:23,965
with Detective Foley present
only as an observer,

1015
01:36:24,069 --> 01:36:26,383
and proceeded to enter the grounds.

1016
01:36:26,487 --> 01:36:29,973
In defending ourselves,
we shot several suspects,

1017
01:36:30,077 --> 01:36:32,524
including Mr Maitland.

1018
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:38,910
You expect me to believe that report?

1019
01:36:40,329 --> 01:36:43,116
That's the report I'm filing, sir.

1020
01:36:45,335 --> 01:36:50,293
Sergeant Taggart,
why don't you tell me what happened?

1021
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,770
Happened just like
the lieutenant said, Chief.

1022
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:23,366
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

1023
01:37:25,543 --> 01:37:27,364
Thank you, sir.

1024
01:37:27,468 --> 01:37:30,241
That report better be
on my desk in the morning.

1025
01:37:30,346 --> 01:37:32,628
Yes, sir. First thing.

1026
01:37:40,933 --> 01:37:43,341
You were lying your ass off.

1027
01:37:46,814 --> 01:37:50,101
Go to the hospital
and get your shoulder looked at.

1028
01:37:51,153 --> 01:37:53,276
Excuse me, sir.

1029
01:37:57,868 --> 01:38:00,573
Could you do me a favour, sir?

1030
01:38:01,997 --> 01:38:05,859
- Your favours are all used up.
- I understand.

1031
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,034
I just hoped you could
call Inspector Todd

1032
01:38:09,139 --> 01:38:12,243
and straighten things out for me,
but that's all right.

1033
01:38:12,347 --> 01:38:14,577
I'm out of a job. It's cool.

1034
01:38:14,682 --> 01:38:16,830
I think I'll stay in Beverly Hills.

1035
01:38:16,934 --> 01:38:20,014
I'm going to start
a private investigation company.

1036
01:38:21,017 --> 01:38:23,676
I'll talk to Todd first thing.

1037
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:25,590
- Really?
- You bet.

1038
01:38:25,695 --> 01:38:26,737
Thank you so much.

1039
01:38:35,115 --> 01:38:37,894
Hi, I'm Axel Foley
checking out of suite 1035.

1040
01:38:37,999 --> 01:38:40,530
One moment, sir. I'll get your bill.

1041
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:48,903
Guys, you didn't have to come
to see me off, but I'm very moved.

1042
01:38:49,008 --> 01:38:53,085
Bogomil ordered us to make sure
you got out of town.

1043
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:57,914
That doesn't matter. What matters
is that you came down here.

1044
01:38:58,019 --> 01:39:01,171
I'm all choked up.
I've got a lump in my throat.

1045
01:39:01,275 --> 01:39:04,047
Look a little misty yourself,
Taggart.

1046
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:06,214
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.

1047
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:10,304
Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police
Department is picking that up.

1048
01:39:10,408 --> 01:39:14,557
Get outta here.
Guys, that's the last straw.

1049
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:16,686
You guys are too nice.

1050
01:39:16,791 --> 01:39:19,063
Do you sell those Beverly Palm robes?

1051
01:39:19,167 --> 01:39:23,068
- Yes, sir. $95 apiece.
- Put them on my tab.

1052
01:39:23,172 --> 01:39:26,498
I have to have two of them, though.

1053
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:30,128
Billy, you saved my life.

1054
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:34,701
I'll never be able to repay you,
but as a token of my appreciation,

1055
01:39:34,805 --> 01:39:37,287
I want you to have
this fine Beverly Palm robe.

1056
01:39:37,391 --> 01:39:41,877
Each time you get in the shower,
think about our friendship.

1057
01:39:41,981 --> 01:39:44,893
Think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.

1058
01:39:49,483 --> 01:39:51,803
Thanks, Axel.

1059
01:39:51,907 --> 01:39:56,558
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.

1060
01:39:56,663 --> 01:39:58,899
Billy, take care of the tab.

1061
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:01,608
- Taggart...
- Here you are, sir.

1062
01:40:01,713 --> 01:40:03,857
This is for you.

1063
01:40:03,962 --> 01:40:07,041
No, that's all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.

1064
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,754
I already have three of them
in my bag.

1065
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,916
Thank you, sir.

1066
01:40:17,021 --> 01:40:19,542
Not going to say goodbye?

1067
01:40:19,646 --> 01:40:22,836
Aren't you tailing me
to the city limits?

1068
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:25,798
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.

1069
01:40:25,902 --> 01:40:28,298
I was thinking
about stopping for a drink.

1070
01:40:28,403 --> 01:40:32,099
- We figured you would.
- Then will you join me?

1071
01:40:33,362 --> 01:40:36,936
I don't think so, Axel.
We're still on duty.

1072
01:40:37,041 --> 01:40:40,311
I don't think
one beer's going to kill us, Billy.

Right. Listen to Taggart. Lighten up.

1074
01:40:43,914 --> 01:40:46,037
One drink's not going to kill us.

1075
01:40:47,334 --> 01:40:51,574
But guys, if you fall too far behind,
don't be afraid to honk, OK?

1076
01:40:51,678 --> 01:40:55,995
- Where we going, anyway?
- Don't worry, just follow my lead.

1077
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:00,222
I know the perfect place.
You guys'll love it. Trust me.
