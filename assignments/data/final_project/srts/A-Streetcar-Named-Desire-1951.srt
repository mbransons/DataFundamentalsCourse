305
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,164
Not sold. Lost!

306
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,624
- Lost.
- Come here.

307
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:41,336
- Stanley. Ow!
- Will you open your eyes to this stuff?

308
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:44,339
- What, she got this out of teacher's pay?
- Oh, hush.

309
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:48,343
Look at these fine feathers and furs
that she comes to preen herself in here?

310
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:51,471
What is this article?
That's a solid-gold dress, I believe.

311
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:55,016
- Oh, honest.
- This one here. What is that, a fox piece?

312
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,769
- Stanley!
- A genuine fur fox a half a mile long.

313
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,146
Where are your fox pieces?

314
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:03,733
This is bushy snow-white ones, no less.
Where are your white fox furs?

315
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,695
Those are inexpensive summer furs
that Blanche has had a long time.

316
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:10,782
I have an acquaintance who deals
in this sort of merchandise.

317
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,369
- He's coming to make an appraisal.
- Don't be such an idiot, Stanley.

318
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:18,623
Listen, I'm gonna bet you there's
a thousand dollars invested in this stuff.

319
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,709
Well, now, what is that?
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?

320
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:25,130
- Oh, Stanley. Would you...?
- That's pearls, Stella. Ropes of them.

321
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:28,007
What is this sister of yours,
a deep-sea diver?

322
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:31,219
Bracelets, solid gold. Where are
your pearls and gold bracelets?

323
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,762
Be still, Stanley.

324
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,014
And here. Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.

325
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:38,768
A rhinestone tiara
she wore to a costume ball.

326
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:41,563
- What is rhinestone?
- Next door to glass.

327
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,022
STANLEY:
Yeah.

328
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,276
I have an acquaintance who works in
a jewelry store and he's coming...

329
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:48,194
...to make an appraisal of that stuff.

330
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:53,533
- Here's your plantation fella, right here.
- You know I... Stupid and horrid.

331
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:56,870
You stay away from these things
before she comes out of the bathroom.

332
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:59,873
The Kowalskis and the DuBois
got a different notion on this.

333
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,751
Indeed they have, thank heavens.
I'm going outside.

334
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,171
Go ahead.

335
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,676
You come on out with me
while Blanche is getting dressed.

336
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,470
Now, since when
are you giving me orders?

337
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:17,765
Are you gonna stay here
and insult her?

338
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:20,268
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.

339
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,952
Hello, Stanley.

340
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:44,083
Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented
and feeling like a brand-new human being.

341
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:45,668
Oh, that's good.

342
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:51,090
Will you excuse me
while I put on my pretty new dress?

343
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:52,926
Go ahead.

344
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,469
[BLANCHE CLEARS THROAT]

345
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,645
Oh.

346
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,072
Thank you.

347
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,964
I understand there's to be
a little card party here tonight...

348
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:34,384
...to which we ladies
are cordially not invited.

349
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:35,843
STANLEY:
That's right.

350
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,721
Where...? Where is Stella?

351
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:42,016
STANLEY:
She's out there on the porch.

352
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,192
I'm going to ask a favor of you
in a moment.

353
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,029
Well, now, what's that gonna be,
I wonder.

354
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,448
Some buttons in back.

355
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,201
You may enter.

356
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:05,206
How do I look?

357
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:06,958
You look okay.

358
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,460
Well, thanks. Now the button.

359
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,926
Well, I can't do no more with them.

360
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:19,095
You men with your big, clumsy fingers.

361
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:22,265
- May I have a drag on your cig?
- Yeah, have one for yourself.

362
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,309
Why, thank you. It...

363
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,103
It looks like my trunk has exploded.

364
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:29,772
Me and Stella was helping you unpack.

365
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:33,109
You certainly did a fast
and thorough job of it.

366
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:36,654
Well, certainly looks like you raided
some stylish shops in Paris, Blanche.

367
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,573
Clothes are my passion.

368
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:41,075
How much does it cost
for a string of furs like that?

369
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:43,411
Why, these were a tribute
from an admirer of mine.

370
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,371
He must have had a lot of admiration.

371
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,374
In my youth I excited some admiration,
but look at me now.

372
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:52,420
Would you think it possible that I
was once considered to be attractive?

373
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:55,131
Your looks are okay.

374
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:58,301
- I was fishing for a compliment.
- I don't go for that stuff.

375
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,678
- What stuff?
- Compliments to women about looks.

376
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,724
I never met a dame didn't know she was
good-looking or not without being told.

377
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:08,019
And some of them give themselves
credit for more than they've got.

378
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:11,272
I once went out with a dame
who told me, "I'm the glamorous type."

379
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,609
She says, "I am the glamorous type."
I says, "So what?"

380
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:17,570
- And what did she say then?
- She didn't say nothing.

381
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:20,656
- That shut her up like a clam.
- Did it end the romance?

382
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:23,743
Well, it ended the conversation,
that was all.

383
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:26,954
There's some men that are took in
by this Hollywood glamour stuff...

384
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:30,625
...and there's some men that aren't.
- You belong in the second category.

385
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:33,294
- That's right.
- I can't imagine any witch of a woman...

386
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,463
...casting a spell over you.
- That's right.

387
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,965
You're simple,
straightforward and honest.

388
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:41,135
A little bit on the primitive side,
I should think.

389
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:44,639
- To interest you a woman would have to...
- To lay her cards on the table.

390
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:47,475
Well, I never did care
for wishy-washy people.

391
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,478
That was why when you walked
in last night, I said to myself:

392
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,855
"My sister has married a man."
Of course.

393
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:55,733
- That was all I could tell...
- How about cutting the rebop!

394
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,110
STELLA:
Stanley!

395
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,322
Come on outside with me
and let Blanche finish dressing.

396
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,408
- I'm finished dressing.
- Then come on out.

397
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,660
- Your sister and I are having a talk.
- Honey...

398
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:08,788
...run to the drugstore and get me
a lemon Coke with chipped ice.

399
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,749
Will you do that for me,
sweetie, please? Please.

400
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:15,002
All right.

401
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,093
Poor thing was out there listening to us.

402
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:25,847
And I have an idea she doesn't
understand you as well as I do.

403
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:30,977
All right now, Mr. Kowalski, let us
proceed without any more digression.

404
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:34,939
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I have nothing to hide.

405
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,691
What is it?

406
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,780
In the state of Louisiana we got here
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

407
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:47,160
Which says, what belongs to the wife
belongs to the husband and vice versa.

408
00:24:47,327 --> 00:24:49,662
My, but you have
an impressive judicial air.

409
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,708
If I didn't know that you was my wife's
sister, I would get ideas about you.

410
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:59,714
- Such as what?
- Don't play so dumb. You know what.

411
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:03,718
All right. Cards on the table.

412
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:09,515
I know I fib a good deal. After all,
a woman's charm is 50 percent illusion.

413
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,269
But when a thing is important
I tell the truth.

414
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:14,937
And this is the truth:

415
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:20,401
I never cheated my sister, or you, or
anyone else on earth as long as I lived.

416
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,906
- Where are the papers, in your trunk?
- Everything I own is in that trunk.

417
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:31,537
What are you thinking of? What's in the
back of that little boy's mind of yours?

418
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,748
Let me do that.
It'll be faster and simple.

419
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:38,669
- I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
- What are those underneath?

420
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:42,715
Those are love letters...

421
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:45,134
...yellowing with antiquity...

422
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:48,513
...all from one boy. Give those back.
- I'm just gonna have a look.

423
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,766
- The touch of your hands insults them.
- Now, don't pull that stuff.

424
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:55,686
Now that you've touched them,
I'll burn them.

425
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,105
What are they?

426
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:02,527
Poems the dead boy wrote.

427
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:06,614
I hurt him the way that you would
like to hurt me. But you can't.

428
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:11,869
I'm not young and vulnerable anymore,
but my young husband was, and I...

429
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,914
Never mind about that.

430
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,625
Just give them back to me.

431
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,797
Thank you.

432
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,300
What'd you mean by saying
you have to burn them up?

433
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:28,511
I'm sorry.

434
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:31,806
I must have lost my head for a moment.

435
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:36,227
Everyone has something they won't
let others touch because of their...

436
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:38,729
Their intimate nature.

437
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,321
Ambler and Ambler.

438
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:49,323
Crabtree.

439
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:52,660
- More Ambler and Ambler.
- What's Ambler and Ambler?

440
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,453
A firm that made loans on the place.

441
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:57,415
- It was lost on a mortgage.
- That must have been what happened.

442
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,334
I don't want if, ands or buts.
What's the rest of the papers?

443
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:04,005
There are thousands of papers
stretching back over hundreds of years...

444
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:05,464
...affecting Belle Reve...

445
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:08,426
...as piece by piece,
our improvident grandfathers...

446
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,012
...exchanged the land
for their epic debauches...

447
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,638
...to put it mildly.

448
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:15,850
Until finally, all that was left...
And Stella can verify that.

449
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:17,351
- Was the house itself.

450
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,105
And about 20 acres of ground,
including a graveyard...

451
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:25,234
...to which now all but Stella
and I have retreated.

452
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:28,738
Here they are, all of them.
All papers.

453
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:33,200
I endow you with them. Take them,

- No, no, I don't understand French.

1079
01:06:06,012 --> 01:06:10,432
Oh. Well, why don't you sit down.
Take off your coat. Loosen your collar.

1080
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,852
- No, I better leave it on.
- No. I want you to be comfortable.

1081
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:17,314
No, I'm ashamed of the way I perspire.
My shirt is sticking to me.

1082
01:06:17,482 --> 01:06:22,277
Perspiration is healthy. If people didn't
perspire, they would die in five minutes.

1083
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,863
Oh, this is a nice coat.
What...?

1084
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:28,075
- What material is it?
- They call this stuff alpaca.

1085

- Oh, lightweight alpaca.
- Yes.

1087

I don't like to wear a watch coat even in
the summer because I sweat through it.

A man with a heavy build is careful of
what he wears so he don't look clumsy.

- I'd say in the vicinity of 180 pounds.
- No, guess again.

1105
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,478
- Not so much?
- No, more.

1106
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:41,398
- Well?
- I weigh 207 pounds.

1107
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:43,900
I'm 6'1 " and one-half inches tall
in my bare feet...

...without shoes on,
and that's what I weigh stripped.

Oh, my goodness, it's awe-inspiring.

1110
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:54,619
Well, my weight's not a very
interesting subject to talk about.

- Why, you're light as a feather.
- You may release me now.

1116

- Huh?
- I said unhand me, sir.

1117
01:08:14,098 --> 01:08:17,851
Mitch, Mitch, we're in public.
You must behave like a gentleman.

1118
01:08:18,019 --> 01:08:20,270
Just give me a slap
whenever I step out of bounds.

1119
01:08:20,438 --> 01:08:25,233
It won't be necessary. You're a natural
gentleman. One of the few left.

1120
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,154
I don't want you to think that I'm
severe or old-maid schoolteacherish...

1121
01:08:29,322 --> 01:08:31,239
...or anything. It's just, well, I...

1122
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:35,827
I guess I have old-fashioned ideals.

Where's Stanley and Stella tonight?

1124
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:55,222
I think they were planning
to take in a midnight preview.

1125
01:08:55,389 --> 01:08:57,808
We all ought to go out together
some night.

1126
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,478
That wouldn't be a good plan.

Why not?

1128

You are an old friend of Stanley's?

1129

- Sure.

1131
01:09:11,739 --> 01:09:13,990
Has he talked to you about me?

1132
01:09:15,701 --> 01:09:17,410
- No, not much.
- The way you say that...

1133
01:09:17,578 --> 01:09:19,746
...I suspect that he has.
- He hasn't said much.

1134
01:09:19,914 --> 01:09:23,834
Well, what he has said, what would
you say his attitude toward me was?

1135
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:25,710
- What makes you ask that?
- Well...

1136
01:09:25,878 --> 01:09:27,921
Don't you get along with him?

1137
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:29,965
What do you think?

1138
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:32,175
I think he don't understand you.

1139
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:37,556
That's putting it mildly. Surely he must
have told you how much he hates me.

1140
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:43,770
I don't think he hates you.

1141
01:09:43,938 --> 01:09:47,232
He hates me,
or why would he insult me?

1142
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:48,775
Of course...

1143
01:09:48,943 --> 01:09:51,820

Oh, no.

1146
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:01,121
To think of it makes me...

1147

- Blanche.
- Yes, honey?

1148
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:08,170
- Blanche, can I ask you a question?
- Yes, what?

What do you want to know that for?

1151
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:19,681
I talked to my mother about you
and she said, "How old is Blanche?"

1152
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,186
- You talked to your mother about me?
- Yes.

1153
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:25,896
Why?

1154
01:10:26,272 --> 01:10:29,608
Because I told her how nice
you were, and I liked you.

Were you sincere about that?

You know I was.

Why did your mother
want to know my age?

1158
01:10:41,662 --> 01:10:46,041
- My mother is sick, and...
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. Badly?

She won't live long...

...maybe just a few months,
and she worries because I'm not settled.

1161

She wants to see me
settled down before she...

1162
01:10:58,638 --> 01:11:01,765
You love her very much, don't you?

1163
01:11:04,143 --> 01:11:07,562
You'll be lonely when she passes on,
won't you?

1164
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:14,027
I know what that means.

1165
01:11:16,614 --> 01:11:18,365
To be Ionely?

1166
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:21,826
I loved someone once.

1167
01:11:21,994 --> 01:11:24,871
And the person I loved, I lost.

...much too completely.

1175
01:11:47,853 --> 01:11:51,314
It was like you suddenly turned
a blinding light...

1176
01:11:51,482 --> 01:11:55,277
...on something that had
always been half in shadow.

1177
01:11:55,653 --> 01:11:58,738
That's how it struck the world for me.

1178
01:11:59,073 --> 01:12:01,074

There was something about the boy.

1181
01:12:06,706 --> 01:12:09,374
A nervousness, a tenderness...

1182
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,293
...an uncertainty.

1183
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,628
And I didn't understand.

1184
01:12:14,088 --> 01:12:18,258
I didn't understand why this boy,
who wrote poetry...

...didn't seem able to do anything else.

He came to me for help.

...unendurably.

...we drove out to a place
called Moon Lake Casino.

We danced the Varsouviana.

Suddenly, in the middle of the dance,
the boy I married broke away from me...

BLANCHE [SINGING]:
Without your love

1266
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,482
It's a honky-tonk parade

1267
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:31,362
So she moved to a hotel
called the Flamingo...

1268
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:33,865
...which is a second-class hotel...

1269
01:17:34,033 --> 01:17:35,867
...and has the advantages...

1270
01:17:36,035 --> 01:17:40,038
...of not interfering with the private
and social life of the personalities there.

1271
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:43,207
Now, the Flamingo is used to
all kinds of goings on.

1272
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:47,879
But the management of the Flamingo
was impressed by Dame Blanche.

1273
01:17:48,047 --> 01:17:50,590
In fact, they were so impressed
that they requested her...

1274
01:17:50,758 --> 01:17:52,967
...to turn in her room key
for permanently.

1275

before she showed here.

this is gonna upset you.

Baby, listen. I checked on every story.

1280
01:18:15,866 --> 01:18:19,535
The trouble was she couldn't
put on her act anymore in Auriol...

1281
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:21,037
...because they wised up.

1282
01:18:21,205 --> 01:18:24,207
And after two, three days they quit,
then she goes on to another one.

1283
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:27,001
The same old line, the same old act
and the same old hooey.

1284
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:29,587
And as time went by,
she became the town character...

1285
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:32,799
...regarded not just as different,
but downright loco and nuts...

Baby, now...

1289
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:45,144
She didn't resign temporarily because
of her nerves. She was kicked out...

1290
01:18:45,312 --> 01:18:47,397
...before the spring term ended.

1291
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,153
And, now, I hate to tell you the reason
that step was taken.

1292
01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:56,781
A 17-year-old kid
she got mixed up with.

1293
01:18:56,949 --> 01:18:58,616
The boy's dad learned about it...

1294
01:18:58,784 --> 01:19:01,411
...and he got in touch
with the high school superintendent.

1295
01:19:01,578 --> 01:19:04,288
And it was practically a town ordinance
passed against her.

01:43:02,852 --> 01:43:06,062
I received a telegram
from an old admirer of mine.

1683
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:10,775
- Anything good?
- I think so. An invitation.

1684
01:43:11,443 --> 01:43:13,069
What to?

1685
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:18,199
A cruise of the Caribbean on a yacht.

1686
01:43:19,076 --> 01:43:20,952
Well, what do you know?

1687
01:43:21,453 --> 01:43:25,123
I was never so surprised in my life.
It came like a bolt from the blue.

1688
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:27,917
Who'd you say it was from?

1689
01:43:29,753 --> 01:43:31,421
An old beau of mine.

1690
01:43:32,965 --> 01:43:35,425
Oh, the one that give you
the white fox fur pieces.

1691
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:37,468
Shep Huntleigh.

1692
01:43:37,636 --> 01:43:39,971
I wore his ATO pin
my last year in college.

1693
01:43:40,139 --> 01:43:42,724
I hadn't seen him for a while,
then just now this wire...

1694
01:43:42,892 --> 01:43:45,935
...inviting me on a cruise of the
Caribbean. The problem is clothes.

1695
01:43:46,103 --> 01:43:49,397
I tore into my trunk to see what I had
that was suitable for the tropics.

1696
01:43:49,565 --> 01:43:52,192
And you come up
with a gorgeous diamond tiara.

1697
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:54,611
This old relic? It's only rhinestones.

1698
01:43:55,446 --> 01:43:57,614
Oh, I thought it was
Tiffany's diamonds.

1699
01:43:57,781 --> 01:44:00,867
Well, anyhow,
I shall be entertained in style.

1700
01:44:01,035 --> 01:44:04,245
Well, it just goes to show you,
Blanche, you never know what's coming.

1701
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,748
When I thought my luck
was beginning to fail me.

1702
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:09,834
Into the picture
pops this Miami millionaire.

1703
01:44:10,169 --> 01:44:12,587
This man is not from Miami.
This man is from Dallas.

1704
01:44:12,755 --> 01:44:15,340
Just so he's from somewhere.

1705
01:44:15,674 --> 01:44:18,509
Close the curtains
before you undress any further.

1706
01:44:18,677 --> 01:44:21,346
No, this is all
I'm gonna undress right now.

1707
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,350
Hey, Blanche,
you seen the bottle opener?

1708
01:44:26,977 --> 01:44:31,064
I used to have a cousin who could open
a bottle of beer with his teeth.

1709
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:35,652
And that was all he could do.
He was just a human bottle-opener.

1710
01:44:36,654 --> 01:44:40,949
Then one time at a wedding party,
he broke his front teeth right off.

1711
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:44,494
And then after that,
he was so ashamed of himself...

1712
01:44:44,662 --> 01:44:48,081
...that he used to sneak out of the house
when company came.

1713
01:44:48,832 --> 01:44:50,959
Rain from heaven.

1714
01:44:59,134 --> 01:45:02,679
What do you say, Blanche? You want to
bury the hatchet and make a loving cup?

1715
01:45:03,389 --> 01:45:04,847
No. No, thank you.

1716
01:45:06,058 --> 01:45:08,643
- Why don't you get with it?
- What are you doing in here?

1717
01:45:08,811 --> 01:45:11,562
Hey, wait a second.
I want to show you something.

1718
01:45:11,981 --> 01:45:14,565
Here's something I always break out
on special occasions:

1719
01:45:14,733 --> 01:45:16,567
Silk pajamas I wore
on my wedding night.

1720
01:45:16,735 --> 01:45:19,195
When they call on that phone
and say, "You got a son"...

1721
01:45:19,363 --> 01:45:22,282
...I'm gonna rip them off
and wave them like a flag!

1722
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:24,534
I guess we're both entitled
to put on a dog.

1723
01:45:24,702 --> 01:45:27,996
You're having an oil millionaire
and I'm having the baby.

1724
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:33,042
When I think of how divine it'll be to
have such a thing as privacy once more...

1725
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:34,877
...I could weep with joy.

1726
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:38,089
This millionaire isn't gonna interfere
with your privacy none?

1727
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:41,009
It won't be the sort of thing
you have in mind.

1728
01:45:41,176 --> 01:45:43,094
This man is a gentleman.
He respects me.

1729
01:45:43,345 --> 01:45:44,887
What he wants is my companionship.

1730
01:45:45,055 --> 01:45:47,473
Having great wealth
sometimes makes people lonely.

1731
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:50,226
A cultivated woman,
a woman of breeding and intelligence...

1732
01:45:50,394 --> 01:45:53,813
...can enrich a man's life immeasurably.
I have those things to offer.

1733
01:45:53,981 --> 01:45:56,316
And time doesn't take them away.

1734
01:45:56,483 --> 01:46:01,362
Physical beauty is passing,
a transitory possession.

1735
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:06,492
But beauty of the mind, richness
of the spirit, tenderness of the heart...

1736
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:12,915
I have all those things... . Aren't taken
away, but grow, increase with the years.

1737
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:14,542
Oh.

1738
01:46:16,545 --> 01:46:20,048
Strange that I should be called
a destitute woman...

1739
01:46:20,215 --> 01:46:24,260
...when I have all these treasures
locked in my heart.

1740
01:46:25,262 --> 01:46:28,931
I think of myself as a very,
very rich woman.

1741
01:46:29,099 --> 01:46:32,977
But I have been foolish,
casting my pearls before...

1742
01:46:33,145 --> 01:46:34,270
Swine, huh?

1743
01:46:34,938 --> 01:46:37,440
Yes. Swine.

1744
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:41,110
And I'm thinking not only of you but
of Mr. Mitchell. He came here tonight.

1745
01:46:41,278 --> 01:46:44,906
He dared to come in his work clothes to
repeat slander, vicious stories from you.

1746
01:46:45,074 --> 01:46:46,908
I gave him his walking papers.

1747
01:46:47,868 --> 01:46:52,413
But then he returned. He returned with
a box of roses to beg my forgiveness.

1748
01:46:52,581 --> 01:46:54,832
He implored my forgiveness.

1749
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:58,669
But some things are not forgivable.

1750
01:47:00,422 --> 01:47:04,384
Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable!

1751
01:47:04,551 --> 01:47:07,303
It is one unforgivable thing,
in my opinion...

1752
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:09,806
...and the one thing
of which I have never...

1753
01:47:09,973 --> 01:47:11,557
...never been guilty.

1754
01:47:11,725 --> 01:47:14,977
So I said to him, "Thank you.

1755
01:47:15,145 --> 01:47:18,523
It was foolish of me to think that
we could adapt ourselves to each other.

1756
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:22,151
Our ways of life are too different,
our backgrounds are incompatible.

1757
01:47:22,444 --> 01:47:28,199
So farewell, my friend,
and let there be no hard feelings."

1758
01:47:45,676 --> 01:47:49,178
Was this before or after
you got the telegram?

1759
01:47:49,805 --> 01:47:52,890
Telegram? What telegram?

1760
01:47:53,684 --> 01:47:56,936
- Heh. As a matter of fact, my wire...
- As a matter of fact...

1761
01:47:57,104 --> 01:47:59,522
...there wasn't no wire at all.

1762
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:05,445
And there isn't no millionaire.

1763
01:48:06,905 --> 01:48:11,200
And Mitch didn't come in here with
roses, because I know where he is.

1764
01:48:11,368 --> 01:48:16,289
And there isn't a thing but imagination
and lies and deceit and tricks.

1765
01:48:16,457 --> 01:48:18,166
And look at yourself.

1766
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:21,377
Take a look at yourself here,
in a worn-out Mardi Gras outfit.

1767

from the start...

1770
01:48:30,637 --> 01:48:33,556

over this boy's eyes.

You come here and sprinkle the place
with powder and you spray perfume...

over the light bulb.
