1
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:45,799
The year, 1462.
Constantinople had fallen.

2
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:54,015
Moslem Turks swept into Europe,
threatening all of Christendom.

3
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:58,645
From Transylvania arose
a Romanian knight.

4
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:02,315
Dracula.

5
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:25,463
On the eve of the battle,
his bride, Elizabetha,

6
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:29,885
knew that he must face
an insurmountable force

7
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:35,140
from which he might never return.

8
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,046
Elizabetha...

9
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:54,553
The vengeful Turks
shot a message into the castle.

10
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,305
It told of Dracula’s death.

11
00:02:57,514 --> 00:03:03,353
Elizabetha, believing him dead,
flung herself into the river.

12
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:46,438
My prince is dead.
All is lost without him.

13
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:50,525
May God unite us in heaven.

14
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:07,287
I've done everything
you asked, Master.

15
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:12,459
All the preparations are in order.
Everything.

16
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:17,214
I await your command, for I know

17
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,510
that when the rewards are given,

18
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:27,015
I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

19
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,063
Thank you.

20
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:37,067
Renfield is deranged.

21
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:43,615
He's lost his mind, poor chap.
Take over his foreign client,

22
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:48,203
this eccentric Count Dracula.
He's buying up property in London.

23
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:52,207
Of course, sir.
Thank you for your confidence.

24
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,588
This is a great opportunity, Harker.
Leave for Transylvania immediately.

25
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:04,928
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

26
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:10,684
May I enquire, what happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

27
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,688
Nothing... Personal problems.

28
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:20,026
Close these transactions, and your
future with this firm is assured.

29
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:24,531
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

30
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:29,661
We've waited this long...

31
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:35,417
- We can be married when I return.
- Of course.

32
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:42,174
- I will write.
- Jonathan...

33
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:50,307
- Jonathan, I love you.
- I love you, Mina.

34
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:24,424
25th May, Budapest.
Left Budapest early this morning.

35
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:27,636
We're leaving the West...

36
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:34,059
We're traveling to the far east
of the country.

37
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:38,647
To the border of Transylvania,
Moldavia and Bukovina

38
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:44,778
in the Carpathian mountains.
One of the wildest areas of Europe.

39
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:52,911
My friend,
welcome to the Carpathians.

40
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:56,456
I am anxiously expecting you.

41
00:08:56,665 --> 00:09:02,254
At the Borgo Pass,
my carriage will await you.

42
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,300
I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one.

43
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:13,473
And I hope you will enjoy your stay
in my beautiful land.

44
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,186
Your friend... D.

45
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:32,158
Diary, 25th May. My dear Jonathan
has been gone almost a week.

46
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:36,037
I wish we'd married
before his departure,

47
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:42,335
but I am happy he was sent
on this important mission.

48
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:46,590
It must be so nice
to see strange countries.

49
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:53,013
I wonder if Jonathan and I
shall ever see them together.

50
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:10,322
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

51
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,946
I say, is the castle far?

52
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,777
Welcome to my home.

53
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:59,115
Enter of your own will and leave
some of the happiness you bring.

54
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:05,163
- Count Dracula?
- I am Dracula.

55
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:10,252
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker,
to my house.

56
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,423
Come in.

57
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:36,695
You will, I trust, excuse me
that I do not join you.

58
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:45,495
I have already dined
and I never drink...

59
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,666
...wine.

60
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:59,801
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

61
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,472
The order of the Dracul...

62
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:07,517
...is a dragon.

63
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:13,773
An ancient society
pledging my forefathers

64
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,779
to defend the church
against all enemies of Christ.

65
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:27,496
That relationship
was not entirely... successful.

66
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:30,373
Oh, yes...

67
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:38,757
It is no laughing matter!

68
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,262
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

69
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:51,770
No devil was greater than Attila,
whose blood flows in these veins.

70
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,319
Blood...

71
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:07,619
...is too precious a thing
in these times.

72
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:14,668
The warlike days are over.

73
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:22,509
The victories of my great race
are but a tale to be told.

74
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:31,226
I am the last of my kind.

75
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,483
I have offended you
with my ignorance. Forgive me.

76
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,209
I long to go through the crowded
streets of your mighty London.

77
00:15:56,418 --> 00:16:01,131
To be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity.

78
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:06,845
To share its life, its changes...
its death.

79
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:11,057
There. You, Count...

80
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:17,814
... are the owner of Carfax Abbey.
Congratulations.

81
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:22,319
Your firm writes most highly
of your talents.

82
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:28,491
They say
you are a man of good... taste.

83
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:37,292
And that you are a worthy substitute
to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

84
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,295
You may rely on me.

85
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:45,342
I'm curious. Why ten houses
in such precise locations?

86
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:50,055
Is it to raise the market value?

87
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,935
Do you believe in destiny?

88
00:16:56,645 --> 00:17:01,441
That even the powers of time

89
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,155
can be altered
for a single purpose?

90
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:22,379
The luckiest man on earth
is the one who finds... true love.

91
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:27,676
You found Mina.
I thought she was lost.

92
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:34,599
We're to be married when I return.
Are you married, Count?

93
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:38,353
Sir, are you married?

94
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:41,982
I was married once.

95
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,612
Ages ago, it seems.
She died.

96
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:53,368
- I'm very sorry.
- She was fortunate.

97
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:59,499
My life, at its best, is misery.

98
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:08,633
She will, no doubt,
make a devoted wife...

99
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,596
...and you a faithful husband.

100
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:21,563
Come, write to your firm
and any loved ones.

101
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:28,278
Say that it should please you
to stay with me for a month.

102
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:34,701
A month?
Do you wish me to stay so long?

103
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:41,416
I will take no refusal.

104
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:55,847
Diary. 30th May, 1897.

105
00:18:56,014 --> 00:19:00,143
Jonathan does not want me
to stay with Lucy while he is away.

106
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:05,065
If I become accustomed to the
privileges of the Weston family,

107
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:09,486
he thinks I will not be content
as the wife of a mere clerk.

108
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:12,405
But Lucy and I are friends.

109
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:17,744
She has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.

110
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,128
Disgusting!

111
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:33,844
Mina...

112
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:41,476
Mina, you're always working.

113
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:47,148
Is your ambitious John Harker
forcing you to learn that machine?

114
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:54,114
He could be forcing you into acts
of passion on the parlor floor.

115
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:59,161
Lucy! You shouldn't talk about
my fiancé in such a way.

116
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:02,747
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasures.

117
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:08,712
So I see... much, much more!

118
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:20,515
What is it, Lucy?
I don't understand it.

119
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:25,353
Can man and woman
really do... that?

120
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:29,774
- I did... only last night.
- Fibber! You did not.

121
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:35,363
Yes, I did. Well, in my dreams.

122
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,203
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?
You can tell Lucy.

123
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,872
We've kissed, that's all.

124
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,210
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

125
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:53,340
It's all the worse now that
I'm visiting you... my rich friend.

126
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:59,554
Yes, but not one marriage proposal,
and here I am almost 20...

127
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,932
Practically a hag!

128
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:10,649
Mr. Quincy P. Morris!

129
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,779
Look! What is that?

130
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:23,203
A Texan. Quincy P. Morris.
He's so young and fresh.

131
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:28,041
- A wild stallion between my legs.
- You're positively indecent!

132
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:32,420
I just know what men desire.
Watch.

133
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:35,882
- Quincy, darling.
- Miss Lucy...

134
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:39,386
You're as fresh as a spring rain.

135
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:46,518
Quincy, please let me touch it.

136
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,731
It's so big.

137
00:21:53,567 --> 00:22:02,075
My dear, sweet little girl. I hold
your hand, and you've kissed me.

138
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:08,039
Jack! Oceans of love...

139
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:11,835
Oh, my poor little baby!

140
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:16,590
Come over here,
my poor little blossom.

141
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:21,803
My poor, little, brilliant doctor.

142
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:27,601
- What a naughty bear.
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.

143
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:30,729
My darling.

144
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:36,276
I'm so sorry about your hat.

145
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:39,738
This is my snake dress.

146
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:46,703
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl,
but she does shock me sometimes.

147
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:52,417
Jonathan says a defect of the rich
is that they say what they please.

148
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:57,506
But I admire Lucy and I'm not
surprised men flock around her.

149
00:22:57,714 --> 00:23:02,093
I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.

150
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:12,938
You are the love of my life.

151
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,613
What manner of man is this?

152
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,576
R.N. Renfield, successful solicitor
in the firm of Hawkins & Thompkins.

153
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:29,871
Member of the Wyndham Club.

154
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,543
He returns from business abroad
in Transylvania

155
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:41,550
and suffers a mental breakdown.
He's obsessed with some bloodlust.

156
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:47,097
George.

157
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:51,893
Wait here.

158
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:04,239
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre,
doctor, or a canapé?

159
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:11,621
- No, thank you. How are you?
- Better than my love-sick doctor.

160
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,669
- Does my private life interest you?
- Of course. All life interests me.

161
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:24,384
- Your diet is disgusting.
- They're perfectly nutritious.

162
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:29,598
Each life that I ingest
gives back life to me.

163
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:38,315
- A fly gives you life?
- Certainly.

164
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:45,030
You'll eat molecules with chopsticks
before I eat the lesser carnivore.

165
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:50,327
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

166
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:54,206
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

167
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,337
- Yes, spiders eat them.
- What about sparrows?

168
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:06,635
- Yes... did you say sparrows?
- Something larger perhaps?

169
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:13,433
Oh yes...
A kitten. I beg you!

170
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:18,063
A little, sleek, playful kitten.
Something I can teach.

171
00:25:18,271 --> 00:25:21,983
Something I can feed.
Don't refuse me.

172
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:26,655
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

173
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:32,744
Yes! A big cat!
My salvation depends upon it.

174
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:37,582
- Your salvation?
- Yes, lives for the Master.

175
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:41,419
Master? What master?

176
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:45,131
The Master will come.

177
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,220
- He's promised to make me immortal.
- How?

178
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:58,144
The blood is the life!

179
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:01,815
Blood is the life!

180
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:09,281
30th May, Castle Dracula. I think
things that I dare not confess.

181
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:14,202
The way the Count looked at
Mina's picture fills me with fear.

182
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:19,541
As if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.

183
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:45,483
I didn't hear you come in.

184
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,534
Take care. You cut yourself.
It is more dangerous than you think.

185
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:04,920
A foul bauble of man's... vanity.

186
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:09,591
Perhaps you should grow a beard.

187
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:23,688
The letters I requested...
have you written them?

188
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:41,665
Good.

189
00:27:49,756 --> 00:27:54,386
Should you leave these rooms,

190
00:27:54,594 --> 00:28:00,892
you will not go to sleep
in any other part of the castle.

191
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:08,567
It is old and has many bad memories.

192
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:16,366
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

193
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:26,418
Do not put your faith in such...
trinkets of deceit.

194
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:35,719
We are in Transylvania,
and Transylvania is not England.

195
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:39,389
Our ways are not your ways.

196
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:45,020
And to you...
there shall be many strange things.

197
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:52,402
I've seen strange things already.
Wolves chasing me! A blue inferno!

198
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,369
Listen to them.

199
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:08,627
The children of the night.

200
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:16,384
- What sweet music they make.
- Music? Those animals?

201
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:53,088
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

202
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:56,883
To the firm, to my family,
and to my beloved Mina.

203
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,763
I said nothing of my fears,
as he will read them, no doubt.

204
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,646
I know now that I am a prisoner.

205
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:35,899
Jonathan...

206
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:39,694
Jonathan, come to me.

207
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:51,081
Come.

208
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:13,478
Lay down.
Lay back into my arms.

209
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:27,200
Lay back, Jonathan.

210
00:34:16,977 --> 00:34:20,480
What is this? Charlatans!

211
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:44,981
Dearest Mina, all is well here.

212
00:35:45,148 --> 00:35:50,320
The Count has insisted
that I remain here for a month.

213
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:56,535
I can say no more, except I
love you. Ever faithful, Jonathan.

214
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:05,210
The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

215
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:13,760
The Count's gypsies, loyal to the
death to whomever they serve.

216
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:23,812
Day and night, they fill boxes with
earth from the castle's cellar.

217
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,442
They are to be delivered
to Carfax Abbey in London.

218
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,365
Why do they fill these boxes
with earth?

219
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:44,082
I love him!

220
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:49,171
Mina, it's so wonderful.
I've decided.

221
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:53,884
- I love him and I've said yes!
- Finally.

222
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:58,471
- The Texan with the big knife?
- No, to my number three.

223
00:36:58,638 --> 00:37:05,520
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
You're to be my maid of honor.

224
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:11,193
Mina, what is it? It's the most
exciting day of my life.

225
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,698
- You don't seem to care.
- I'm so worried about Jonathan.

226
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:23,330
This letter I received is so cold.
It's not like him at all.

227
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:27,751
Mina, don't worry.

228
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:57,739
Captain's log, the Demeter.
27th June, 1897.

229
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:04,913
We picked up 50 boxes of earth
bound for London, England.

230
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:10,001
We set sail at noon into a storm
that seemed to come from nowhere,

231
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:13,421
carrying us out to sea.

232
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:52,335
3rd July. Second mate is missing.
Nearing Gibraltar.

233
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:55,922
Storm continues.
Crew uneasy.

234
00:38:56,089 --> 00:39:03,388
Believes someone or something
is aboard the ship with us.

235
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:21,448
He is here!
The master of all life is at hand!

236
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:25,994
Gather round! I am here
to do your bidding, Master!

237
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:32,209
I have worshipped you from afar,
but now you are near.

238
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:37,672
I am your slave.
I await your command.

239
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:40,675
The Renfield case
grows more interesting.

240
00:39:40,884 --> 00:39:44,638
There is method in his madness,
with his flies and spiders.

241
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:51,561
Had I the secret
of even one such brilliant mind...

242
00:39:58,485 --> 00:40:00,612
Lucy...

243
00:40:57,711 --> 00:41:02,090
Lucy!

244
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,485
No, do not see me!

245
00:42:56,788 --> 00:43:00,834
Lucy...

246
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:06,756
- I couldn't control myself.
- You're dreaming. Sleepwalking.

247
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:11,011
My soul...
It seemed to leave my body.

248
00:43:11,178 --> 00:43:15,223
There was this agonizing feeling.

249
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,020
- I started shaking.
- It's all right, you're dreaming.

250
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:25,233
It pulled me and lured me.
I had no control.

251
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:33,617
Those red eyes. I still have
the taste of his blood in my mouth.

252
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:56,681
Master, I'm here to do your bidding.
