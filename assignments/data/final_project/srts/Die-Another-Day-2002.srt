1
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,760
Look, what is this? I'm supposed to...

2
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,740
Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's H.Q.
De-Militarised Zone North Korea.

3
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,160
Open the bag.

4
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
That will teach you to lecture me.

5
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,750
Retract the blast doors.

6
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,020
Find me a new anger therapist.

7
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,720
I am Zao.

8
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,380
You are late.

9
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,920
Mr. Van Bierk. I've been looking
forward to this meeting.

10
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,220
Me too.

11
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,800
My African military friends owe
you many thanks, Colonel Moon.

12
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,730
Few men have the guts to trade conflict
diamonds since the U.N. embargo.

13
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,960
I know all about the U.N. I
studied at Oxford and Harvard.

14
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,400
Majored in Western hypocrisy.

15
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,770
From your modest collection of
cars, I wouldn't have guessed.

16
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,880
Show me the diamonds.

17
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,110
Show me the weapons.

18
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,690
Bring the weapons.

19
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,470
Hiding weapons in the de-militarised zone.

20
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,710
- It's a bit of a minefield out there.
- America's cultural contribution.

21
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,780
One million landmines. And my
hovercrafts float right over them.

22
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,320
RPGs, flamethrowers, automatic weapons...

23
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,400
and enough ammunition to run a small war.

24
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,660
My diamonds?

25
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,680
Check it over quick.

26
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,180
Don't blow it all at once.

27
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,020
I have special plans for this consignment.

28
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,870
His name is James Bond, a British assassin.

29
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,960
Mr. Van Bierk, let me show you something.

30
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,920
Our new tank buster.

31
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,390
Depleted uranium shells, naturally.

32
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,160
Naturally.

33
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,840
And how do you propose to
kill me now, Mr. Bond?

34
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,250
It's pathetic that you British still beliee
you have the right to police the world.

35
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,660
You will not live to see the day
all Korea is ruled by the North.

36
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,800
Then you and I have something in common.

37
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,970
Who is it?

38
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,970
Where's my son?

39
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,580
It's the General.

40
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,440
Hello... Father.

41
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,710
Why is there a fire?

42
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,880
I'll be there in five minutes.

43
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,150
Get the weapons out of here.

44
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,150
And kill the spy.

45
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,060
Saved by the bell.

46
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,790
My son is dead.

47
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,430
14 months later

48
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,750
I don't condone what they do here.

49
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,710
Tell it to the concierge.

50
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,730
Still you jest.

51
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,460
Defiant to the last.

52
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,660
Your people have abandoned you.

53
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,010
Your very existence denied.

54
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,080
Why stay silent?

55
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,920
It doesn't matter anymore.

56
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,610
Things are out of my hands.

57
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,700
We reach the end, Mr. Bond.

58
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,460
Spare me the unpleasantries.

59
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,700
Fifty years after the superpowers
carved Korea in two...

60
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,340
and then you arrive.

61
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,380
A British spy, an assassin.

62
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,010
And now the hard-liners have their proof.

63
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,250
We cannot trust the West.

64
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,920
You...

65
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,830
You took away my son.

66
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,760
Your firing squad should
have done the job for me.

67
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,910
I hoped a Western education would
help him become a bridge...

68
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,300
between our worlds.

69
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,710
But all it did was to corrupt him.

70
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,610
Let's get this over with, shall we?

71
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,680
My son had an ally in the West.

72
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,390
For the last time, who was it?

73
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,420
Who made him betray his country and name?

74
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,330
The same person who betrayed me.

75
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,010
Turn around.

76
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,850
Start walking.

77
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,070
Keep walking, please.

78
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,070
Keep moving.

79
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,950
Zao.

80
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,650
I'm being traded...

81
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,660
for you.

82
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,560
Keep moving. Keep walking, please.

83
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,500
Your time will come.

84
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,670
Not as soon as yours.

85
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,640
Keep walking, please.

86
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,590
Look at him.

87
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,850
Double check.

88
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,690
You'd think he was some kind of a hero.

89
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,760
- Reference nine.
- Sir.

90
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,130
Section four.

91
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,200
Okay, hold him tight. Got him.

92
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,500
Watch his legs now.

93
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,350
All right, let's go.

94
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,750
No biological agents in the prelim scan.
He's clean.

95
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,550
Pulse, 72. Blood pressure, 120/80.

96
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,290
Indications of neurotoxins, histamine,
serotonin and enzyme inhibitors.

97
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,160
Scorpion venom.

98
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,840
Note also traces of a venom antiserum.

99
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,340
They'd sting him then
administer the antidote.

100
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,510
Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.

101
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,840
Liver not too good. It's
definitely him then.

102
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,080
Morning.

103
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,730
Welcome back.

104
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,770
Such hospitality.

105
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,620
You don't seem too pleased to see me.

106
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,520
If I'd had my way, you'd
still be in North Korea.

107
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,660
Your freedom came at too high a price.

108
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,400
Zao.

109
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,840
He tried to blow up a summit
between South Korea and China.

110
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,840
Took out three Chinese
agents before he was caught.

111
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,340
And now he's free.

112
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,410
I never asked to be traded.

113
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,950
I'd rather die than let him loose.

114
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,990
- You had cyanide.
- Threw it away years ago. What is this?

115
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,920
The top American agent...

116
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,000
in the North Korean High Command
was executed a week ago.

117
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,830
The Americans intercepted a signal
from your prison naming him.

118
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,130
- And they think it's me?
- You were the only inmate.

119
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,440
They concluded you cracked and
were hemorrhaging information.

120
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,840
We had to get you out.

121
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,410
And what do you think?

122
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,390
With the drugs they gave you, you
wouldn't know what you said.

123
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,890
I know the rules.

124
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,830
And number one is, no deals.

125
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,200
Get caught and you're given up.

126
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,630
The mission was compromised.

127
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,430
Moon got a call exposing me.

128
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,810
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew.

129
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,640
- Whether that's true or not, it's irrelevant.
- No, it isn't.

130
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,020
The same person who set me up
then set me up to get Zao out.

131
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,810
So I'm going after him.

132
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,690
You're going to our evaluation
center in the Falklands.

133
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,520
Double-O status rescinded.

134
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,790
Along with my freedom?

135
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,130
For as long as I deem necessary, yes.

136
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,600
You're no use to anyone now.

137
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,270
- He's in cardiac arrest.
- Get the crash cart. Notify his superiors.

138
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,110
- He's flat-lining on the ECG.
- Stand by.

139
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,950
Two hundred joules.

140
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,310
Three hundred.

141
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,750
Get me some atropine. We're losing him!
Stand by. Clear.

142
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,130
I'm checking out.

143
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,500
Thanks for the kiss of life.

144
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,240
Security breach on level three. All
personnel, defensive code red.

145
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,850
Apprehend and detain with force.

146
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,210
Security breach on level three. All
personnel, defensive code red.

147
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,410
Apprehend and detain with force.

148
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,720
Security breach on level three. All
personnel, defensive code red.

149
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,070
My goodness, standards are falling.

150
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,110
No tie, dear me.

151
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,940
My usual suite, please.

152
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,880
Do you have a credit card?

153
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,050
Or even any luggage, sir?

154
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,850
Mr. Bond, so good to see you.

155
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,420
- It's been a long time.
- Mr. Chang.

156
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,590
Open the Presidential Suite.

157
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,460
Send up my tailor. And some food.

158
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,360
The lobster's good, with quails'
eggs and sliced seaweed.

159
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,200
- And if there's any left, a '61 Bollinger.
- Of course.

160
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,100
Do it... quickly.

161
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,270
Been busy, have we, Mr. Bond?

162
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,570
Just surviving, Mr. Chang. Just surviving.

163
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,670
I am Peaceful Fountains
of Desire, the masseuse.

164
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,840
I come with compliments of the manager.

165
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,600
I'm sure you do. Come in.

166
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,750
On the bed, please. Face down.

167
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,250
Yes, of course.

168
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,060
I'm not that kind of masseuse.

169
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,590
I'm not that kind of customer.

170
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,040
You think I haven't always known
you're Chinese Intelligence, Chang?

171
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,610
- Hong Kong is our turf now.
- Don't worry about it.

172
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,150
I'm not here to take it back.

173
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,820
Put your hands down.

174
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,650
What the hell do you want?

175
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,460
Just to help you settle a score.

176
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,830
Zao killed three of your men.

177
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,030
You get me into North Korea,
I'll take care of him for you.

178
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,200
What's in it for you?

179
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,170
Chance to get even.

180
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,350
Zao has information I need.

181
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,350
- I'll have to ask Beijing.
- Do it.

182
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,650
Now get out.

183
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,090
Unless you really wanna give me a massage.

184
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,570
Mr. Bond.

185
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,210
A little thank-you from us.

186
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,420
Cuba?

187
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,560
It seems Mr. Zao has
lost himself in Havana.

188
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,290
If you find him, say goodbye from us.

189
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,060
With pleasure.

190
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,400
HAVANA

191
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,300
I'm here to pick up some Delectados.

192
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,560
Delectados? We haven't made
Delectados in 30 years.

193
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,140
Universal Exports. Check with your boss.

194
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,180
Raoul...

195
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,780
Universal Exports.

196
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,940
Follow me.

197
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,080
Your passport, se? Or.

198
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,260
I'd come to think the Delectados
would never be smoked.

199
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,360
They are particularly hazardous
for one's health, Mr...?

200
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,300
Bond.

201
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,370
Mr. Bond.

202
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,230
Do you know why?

203
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,170
It's the addition of the Volado tobacco.

204
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,310
Slow burning.

205
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,780
It never goes out.

206
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,390
Just like a sleeper.

207
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,150
Sorry for the rude awakening.

208
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,180
I love my country.

209
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,090
I'd never ask you to betray your people.

210
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,660
- I'm after a North Korean.
- A tourist?

211
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,920
A terrorist.

212
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,070
One man's terrorist is another
man's freedom fighter.

213
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,200
Zao has no interest in
other people's freedom.

214
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,640
I still have some friends in high places.

215
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,650
Favors called in. Some
dollars spread about.

216
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,520
We find your friend is here, on an island.

217
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,350
In Los Organos.

218
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,790
There is a strange clinic
run by Dr. Alvarez.

219
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,490
He leads the field in gene therapy.

220
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,570
Increasing the life expectancy
of our beloved leaders.

221
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,070
And, of course, the richest Westerners.

222
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,540
We may have lost our freedom
in the revolution...

223
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,480
but we have a health system second to none.

224
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,320
You didn't do too badly
out of the revolution.

225
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,250
We all have our ways of getting by.

226
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,730
You'd be surprised how many
government officials come to me...

227
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,630
- ...for reminders of the decadent times.
- Yeah, well...

228
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,900
- Mind if I borrow these?
- Please.

229
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,070
My sources tell me this
Zao is very dangerous.

230
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,640
I wish I could give you more help.

231
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,750
I could use a fast car.

232
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,120
Mojito, por favor.

233
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,850
Mr. Krug, your admittance
papers for the Alvarez Clinic.

234
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,720
About bloody time, Fidel.

235
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,800
Round up more girls and
take them to room 42.

236
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,870
Unless you want to be
known as Fidel Castrato.

237
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,130
Magnificent view.

238
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,600
It is, isn't it?

239
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,830
Too bad it's lost on everybody else.

240
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,240
Mojito?

241
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,210
You should try it.

242
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,110
Giacinta Johnson. My friends call me Jinx.

243
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,980
My friends call me James Bond.

244
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,560
Jinx, you say?

245
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,560
Born on Friday the 13th.

246
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,460
Do you believe in bad luck?

247
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,300
Let's just say my relationships
don't seem to last.

248
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,490
I know the feeling.

249
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,810
The predators usually appear at sunset.

250
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,970
And why is that?

251
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,340
It's when their prey comes out to drink.

252
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,990
Too strong for you?

253
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,480
I could learn to like it.
If I had the time.

254
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,090
How much time have you got?

255
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,990
Until dawn. What about you?

256
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,960
I'm just here for the birds.

257
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,460
Ornithologist.

258
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,830
Ornithologist, huh?

259
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,840
Now there's a mouthful.

260
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,910
So you're gonna be busy
tonight with the owls then?

261
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,080
No owls in Los Organos. Nothing
to see till the morning.

262
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,050
Not out there anyway.

263
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,350
So, what do predators do...

264
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,120
when the sun goes down?

265
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,860
They feast...

266
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,290
like there's no tomorrow.

267
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,790
Are you always this frisky?

268
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,790
I've been missing the
touch of a good woman.

269
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,490
Who says I'm good?

270
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,630
What do you want?

271
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,310
- I don't need a wheelchair.
- No?

272
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,600
You do now.

273
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,060
Se? Or.

274
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,500
- Okay.
- Gracias.

275
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,260
Isla Los Organos.

276
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,170
So you are to have DNA-replacement therapy.

277
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,600
Let me explain the two phases.

278
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,250
First, we kill off your bone marrow.
Wipe the DNA slate clean.

279
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,880
Phase two:

280
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,020
Introduction of new DNA
harvested from healthy donors.

281
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,810
Orphans, runaways...

282
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,350
people that won't be missed.

283
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,450
I like to think of myself as an artist.

284
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,660
And this is when I create.

285
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,160
Thank you.

286
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,530
It is a painful process, I'm afraid, but...

287
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,310
all great art is.

288
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,170
I'll certainly enjoy working on you.

289
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,950
Of course, most artists are
only truly appreciated...

290
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,780
after they're dead.

291
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,740
My father was a sergeant.
We lived in Hampshire.

292
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,040
I have fond memories of the countryside.

293
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,970
Good.

294
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,900
Got your attention.

295
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,880
Who's bankrolling your makeover, Zao?

296
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,610
Same person who set me up in North Korea?

297
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,340
James? What's going on?

298
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,610
Jinx, you gotta get out of here now!
Move! Move!

299
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,410
Move it!

300
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,570
Let's go!

301
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:45,020
You see, my friend, the
chemical composition shows...

302
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,490
this is from Sierra Leone.
Conflict diamonds.

303
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,960
There's some kind of marking here.

304
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,730
- "GG."
- Let me see.

305
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,640
Yes.

306
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,110
From the Graves Corporation in Iceland.

307
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,880
That's his laser signature.

308
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,950
A man called Gustav Graves
discovered diamonds there...

309
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,290
a year or so ago.

310
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:19,050
Yet they're identical to conflict diamonds.

311
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,460
What an amazing coincidence.

312
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,960
How can he escape from a British warship...

313
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,160
in the middle of Hong Kong
harbor, right under your nose?

314
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:34,370
- Interesting station, Moneypenny?
- I got a storm warning.

315
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,710
You were supposed to throw away the key...

316
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,900
not leave the door wide open.

317
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,710
Are you implying I had
a hand in his escape?

318
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,850
Well, Bond got away real fast, didn't he?

319
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,920
It is what he's trained to do.

320
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,710
Your boy's been very busy.

321
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,980
He torches a clinic in Cuba.

322
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:54,330
Listen, you put your house in order...

323
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,190
or we're gonna do it for you.

324
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,180
Your drink, sir.

325
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,010
Lucky I asked for it shaken.

326
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,410
- When's he coming?
- I don't know.

327
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,050
- Looks like your man won't make it.
- He's right on time.

328
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,380
Wonderful day to become a knight.

329
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,760
Will you be using your title, Mr. Graves?

330
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,160
I'm proud of my adopted nation,
but I'd never stand on ceremony.

331
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,520
After that entrance, you
can't be surprised...

332
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,860
you're called a self-publicizing
adrenaline junkie, can you?

333
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,700
I prefer "adventurer."

334
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,270
We've heard about the Icarus space program.
What's the secret?

335
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,930
It's a surprise. You'll
soon be enlightened.

336
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,480
You work 24/7. Is it true
that you don't need sleep?

337
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,550
You get one shot at life.
Why waste it on sleep?

338
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,450
Aren't you trying out for
the Olympic fencing team?

339
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,820
- We hear you're training furiously.
- I never get furious.

340
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,420
As they say in fencing, "What's the point?"

341
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,720
Thank you.

342
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,230
We don't want to keep Her
Majesty waiting any longer.

343
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,490
- Mr. Graves.
- Mr. Graves.

344
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,210
Hit.

345
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,680
That's a hit.

346
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,350
Hit.

347
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,100
Verity?

348
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,570
James Bond.

349
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,530
Your lesson.

350
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,570
I see you handle your weapon well.

351
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,930
I have been known to keep my tip up.

352
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,950
Do you mind? I think I've come undone.

353
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,490
Why not?

354
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,520
Hit. Positions. Play.

355
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:15,490
Feast your eyes on the
finest blade in the club.

356
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,930
Gustav Graves?

357
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,300
His publicist, Miranda Frost.

358
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,130
Gorgeous, isn't she?

359
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,640
She took the gold at Sydney.

360
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,780
- By default, if I remember.
- Default?

361
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,080
The one who beat her OD'd on steroids.

362
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,050
Miranda deserved that gold.

363
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,720
Now she's teaching Graves how to win one.

364
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,220
He only plays for cash.

365
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,090
He's won so much, nobody
else wants to fight him.

366
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,630
You wanna meet him?

367
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,730
Absolutely.

368
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,470
Lead on.

369
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,570
- Gustav?
- Verity.

370
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,980
- And Mr...?
- Bond.

371
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,910
James Bond.

372
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,820
- Have we met before?
- I think I'd remember.

373
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,200
Of course you would. My mistake.

374
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,160
- Are you a gambling man, Mr. Bond?
- If the stakes are right.

375
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,800
A thousand a point too much for you?

376
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,810
Care to place a bet, Verity?

377
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,380
No, thanks.

378
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,580
I don't like cockfights.

379
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,770
Shall we?

380
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,920
Excuse me.

381
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,250
Best of three hits?

382
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,560
Positions.

383
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,520
Ready. Play.

384
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:58,820
En garde.

385
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,930
Hit.

386
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,630
Positions.

387
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,910
Play.

388
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,280
Hit.

389
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,290
Two-nil.

390
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,350
Do you want to continue?

391
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,690
- You wanna up the wager?
- How much can you afford?

392
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:33,160
Let's play for this.

393
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,730
I picked it up in Cuba.

394
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,870
I believe it's one of yours.

395
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,940
My, my. They do get around.

396
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,040
But then diamonds are for everyone.

397
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,950
Brilliant specimen. Completely flawless.

398
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,880
And chemically identical to
African conflict diamonds.

399
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,860
Then you're about to lose
something very precious.

400
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,790
Positions.

401
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,600
Ready.

402
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,390
- Play.
- En garde.

403
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,480
Oh, dear.

404
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,050
You want to continue?

405
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,120
Of course I want to bloody continue!

406
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,510
But since we're upping the wager...

407
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,810
let's up the weapons, shall we?

408
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:37,790
Let's do this the old-fashioned way.
First blood drawn from the torso.

409
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,290
That is enough!

410
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,370
It's just a little sport, Miranda.

411
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,510
Seems you beat me, Mr. Bond.

412
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,540
Settle downstairs, shall we?

413
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,330
You're a rare challenge, Mr. Bond.

414
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:37,870
I'm putting on a scientific demonstration
in Iceland at the weekend. Icarus?

415
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:41,280
Perhaps you could join us.
Miranda, make the arrangements.

416
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,380
Once I've smoothed things
over with the club.

417
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,020
What would I do without you?

418
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,390
Can I expect the pleasure
of you in Iceland?

419
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,290
I'm afraid you'll never have that pleasure.

420
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,000
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Someone left this for you.

421
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,160
Place needed redecorating anyway.

422
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,380
I heard of this place.

423
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:00,220
Never thought I'd find myself here.

424
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,520
Some things are best kept underground.

425
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:08,890
An abandoned station for abandoned agents.

426
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:13,570
- Your calling card.
- So, what have you got on Graves?

427
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,110
You burn me...

428
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,940
- and now you want my help?
- Did you expect an apology?

429
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:24,710
I know you'll do whatever it
takes to get the job done.

430
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,750
- Just like you.
- The difference is, I won't compromise.

431
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:32,580
Well, I don't have the luxury of
seeing things as black and white.

432
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,750
- While you were away, the world changed.
- Not for me.

433
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,830
You're suspicious of Graves, or
I wouldn't be here right now.

434
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,600
- So, what do you have?
- Nothing beyond the official biography.

435
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,340
Orphan working in a diamond mine...

436
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:57,280
learns engineering, makes a huge find in
Iceland and gives half of it to charity.

437
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,450
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.

438
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:06,820
- And his demonstration this weekend?
- Probably just another publicity stunt.

439
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,750
Tell me what you know
about this Cuban clinic.

440
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,160
Gene therapy.

441
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,300
New identities courtesy of DNA transplants.

442
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:21,770
So-called "beauty parlor." We'd heard rumors.
I didn't think it really existed.

443
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,630
It doesn't anymore.

444
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:30,140
Zao got away, but he left these behind.

445
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:34,280
All from Gustav Graves' mine.

446
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,720
I think it's a front for laundering
African conflict diamonds.

447
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:45,360
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is politically connected.

448
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,960
Lucky I'm on the outside, then.

449
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,670
It seems you've become useful again.

450
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,870
Then maybe it's time you
let me get on with my job.

451
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,620
Forgive my mentioning it,
but a perfect marksman...

452
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:25,190
isn't really supposed
to shoot his own boss.

453
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:29,500
Check the replay.

454
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:34,000
You'll find he's dead and
she's only got a flesh wound.

455
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,770
There's always an excuse,
isn't there, double-O zero?

456
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,940
Give me the old firing range any day.

457
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,950
Yes, but it's called the
future, so get used to it.

458
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:49,140
So this is where they keep
the old relics, then, eh?

459
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:53,690
This is where our most cutting-edge
technology is developed.

460
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,550
- Point taken.
- Must you touch everything?

461
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,850
Does this still work?

462
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,340
- Now, look...
- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?

463
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,510
I'm trying to get to it.

464
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,310
Weapon, please.

465
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:25,520
One pane unbreakable glass, one
standard-issue ring finger.

466
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,320
Twist so. Voilo.

467
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:33,090
Ultra-high frequency single-digit
sonic agitator unit.

468
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,560
- You're cleverer than you look.
- Better than looking cleverer...

469
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,460
than you are. Follow me.

470
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:42,230
Now, a new watch. This will
be your 20th, I believe.

471
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,470
- How time flies.
- Yes, well, 007...

472
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:48,540
why don't you establish a
record by returning this one.

473
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,480
Your new transportation.

474
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:06,260
- Maybe you've been down here too long.
- The ultimate in British engineering.

475
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,060
- You must be joking.
- As I learned from my predecessor...

476
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:14,000
I never joke about my work.

477
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:19,510
Aston Martin call it the
Vanquish, we call it the Vanish.

478
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:26,150
- Very good.
- Adaptive camouflage.

479
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:29,250
Tiny cameras project the image they see...

480
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:33,150
onto a light-emitting polymer
skin on the opposite side.

481
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,290
To the casual eye, as good as invisible.
Plus, the usual refinements:

482
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:43,190
Ejector seat, torpedoes, target-seeking
shotguns to shoot down mobile objects.

483
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:48,200
The manual. Should be able to shoot
through that in a couple of hours.

484
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:56,680
Just took a few seconds, Q.

485
01:06:57,450 --> 01:07:00,250
Wish I could make you vanish.

486
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,950
Come in.

487
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:12,190
Before you leave on your
mission for Iceland...

488
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,370
tell me what you know of James Bond.

489
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,460
He's a double-O. A wild
one, as I discovered today.

490
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:22,560
He'll light the fuse on any
explosive situation...

491
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:27,400
and be a danger to himself and others.
Kill first, ask questions later.

492
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:32,050
His method is to provoke and confront.
A man nobody can get close to.

493
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,770
A womanizer.

494
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:39,310
You're going to be seeing a
lot more of him in Iceland.

495
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:44,450
With great respect, a man
like him could blow my cover.

496
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:50,560
You volunteered for this, but in three
months, you've found next to nothing.

497
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,760
Graves seems to be clean.

498
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,920
Bond thinks differently, so I'm going to
let him do what you so ably described:

499
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:01,660
Mix things up a little with Mr. Graves.
With you there...

500
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,270
things won't get out of hand.

501
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:09,730
In your three years in Cryptology, you've
kept business and pleasure separate.

502
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:16,280
You haven't fraternized with any of your
fellow agents, despite several advances.

503
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,780
It would be foolish to get involved
with someone within the community.

504
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,280
Especially James Bond.

505
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,990
I'm Mr. Kil.

506
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,750
Well, there's a name to die for.

507
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,250
Three hundred and twenty-four miles an hour.
A new personal best.

508
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:38,160
Thruster two cut out again. Get it fixed.

509
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:43,990
- Glad you could make it. Like my run?
- You were on the edge of losing control.

510
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:48,610
It's only by being on the edge that we
know who we really are. Under the skin.

511
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:54,710
Take your Donald Campbell. 1967, the Bluebird.
Water speed record.

512
01:09:55,910 --> 01:10:00,110
- Campbell died on his return run.
- But he died chasing a dream.

513
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,690
- Isn't that the way to go?
- I'd rather not go at all.

514
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:08,220
- You don't chase dreams, you live them.
- A virtue of never sleeping.

515
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:13,860
I have to live my dreams. Besides, plenty
of time to sleep when you're dead.

516
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:16,890
Mr. Bond.

517
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,570
- Miss Frost.
- I'll show you your room.

518
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:23,570
A palace of ice. You
must feel right at home.

519
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:26,400
This was built for tonight's demonstration.

520
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:29,980
The human element necessitates
a balance of heat and cold.

521
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:33,050
Built on a lake? Hope
Graves got things right.

522
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:36,310
- What's that property next door?
- The diamond mine.

523
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,420
And Gustav's living quarters.

524
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:51,400
Thank you.

525
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,930
This is you.

526
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:02,410
Wonderful. Would you like to show me more?

527
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:20,300
Vodka martini. Plenty of
ice, if you can spare it.

528
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:25,960
Mojito?

529
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:31,210
James. Here for the penguins this time?

530
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:36,770
- Or for the view again?
- I'm only interested in endangered species.

531
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,970
Well, does that include me?

532
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,340
- Depends on what you're up to this time.
- So I left you in an explosive situation.

533
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:46,210
Figured you could handle yourself.

534
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:52,290
- No wonder your relationships don't last.
- I just don't like to get tied down.

535
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,470
You look terrible.

536
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,440
You aren't looking too good yourself.

537
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:53,120
- You're still feeling the side effects?
- The insomnia is permanent for me.

538
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,350
An hour on the Dream Machine keeps me sane.

539
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,950
- What happened to you?
- Bond.

540
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:03,090
He knows nothing. I've
been this close to him...

541
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,730
and he didn't know who I really was.

542
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:12,670
- You saw my father after your exchange?
- Yes.

543
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,740
- General Moon still mourns your death.
- My death.

544
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,610
Mr. Bond.

545
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,280
- And Miss...?
- Swift. Space and Technology magazine.

546
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,150
Really? I take it Mr. Bond's been
explaining his big-bang theory?

547
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:35,830
- Yeah, I think I got the thrust of it.
- I see.

548
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,830
The demonstration's about to
begin in five minutes. Shall we?

549
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,090
Shall we?

550
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:52,070
- Not "Jinx" anymore?
- I'll always be a jinx to you.

551
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,590
I'm always trying to give the
planet something in return...

552
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,730
for what it has given me:

553
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:11,660
Those little shards of
heaven known as diamonds.

554
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:16,600
Diamonds aren't just expensive stones.
They are the stuff of dreams.

555
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,030
And the means to make dreams real.

556
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:43,720
Imagine being able to bring light and
warmth to the darkest parts of the world...

557
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:47,870
being able to grow crops year-round,
bringing an end to hunger.

558
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:51,190
Imagine a second sun...

559
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,900
shining like a diamond in the sky.

560
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,640
Let there be light.

561
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:08,310
I give you Icarus!

562
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:20,460
Icarus is unique. Its miraculous silver
skin will inhale the sun's light...

563
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:23,600
and breathe it gently
upon the Earth's surface.

564
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,930
You have no idea how much Icarus
is about to change your world.

565
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:45,710
And now let us brighten this
night with our inner radiance.

566
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,800
All right, that's a wrap.

567
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,380
- Vlad, show me the modifications.
- Yeah.

568
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:28,620
Here is the self-defense mechanism
you asked me to build in.

569
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,450
- Fifty-thousand volts?
- A hundred.

570
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:36,330
Armed...

571
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,500
- and very dangerous.
- Very.

572
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,600
M warned me this would happen.

573
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:42,390
That's why you tried not
to be interested in me.

574
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:45,730
God, you're even worse than your file says.

575
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:50,030
They don't look too convinced.

576
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,710
Come on, put your back into it.

577
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:03,590
I know all about you. Sex for dinner, death
for breakfast. Not gonna work with me.

578
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:05,450
- No?
- No.

579
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:17,970
- You're getting good at this.
- Stop it. Are we still being watched?

580
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,640
- They left ages ago.
- God, you're impossible.

581
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,570
Let's get out of here.

582
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:56,000
You'd better stay here. Keep up
the charade of being lovers.

583
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,330
All right.

584
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:02,710
I admire your restraint. You were here a
full two hours before anything blew up.

585
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:07,480
The way you're going,
you'll get us both killed.

586
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:14,150
James, tell me what really
happened in North Korea.

587
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,290
I was betrayed.

588
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:18,160
That was all.

589
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,060
Occupational hazard.

590
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,380
This is crazy. You're a double-O.

591
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,910
It's only a number.

592
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,520
James...

593
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:20,230
be careful.

594
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,760
Go back to your room.
I'll come back for you.

595
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,230
Why do you want to kill me?

596
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,500
I thought it was the humane thing to do.

597
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,840
Who sent you?

598
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,270
Your mama.

599
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,970
And she's really disappointed in you.

600
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:22,050
I'll let you in on a little secret.

601
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:26,420
This mine is fake, but the lasers...

602
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,550
are real.

603
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,520
She won't talk.

604
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,280
Let's make it permanent.

605
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:57,390
I'll use the laser.

606
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:59,680
Don't leave a mess.

607
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,270
- Jinx?
- James! James! No, no!

608
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,940
Turn it off! Off! Off!

609
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:51,100
James, I could use a little help here.

610
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,680
Switch it off...

611
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,810
or I'll be half the girl I used to be.

612
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:47,390
So, the girl who hates
to be tied down, huh?

613
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:49,320
Are you gonna get me off this?

614
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:52,000
- What are you, CIA?
- NSA.

615
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:56,140
- We're on the same side.
- Doesn't mean we're after the same thing.

616
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:59,430
Sure it does. World peace,
unconditional love...

617
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,570
and our little friend
with the expensive acne.

618
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:05,540
- Zao?
- Yeah, Zao.

619
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:09,540
He's back there with some
weird, psychedelic light mask.

620
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:13,020
Probably brought it from
the clinic in Cuba.

621
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,090
He couldn't have brought it.

622
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:17,690
It was already here.

623
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,290
It belongs to another Korean.

624
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,790
His boss.

625
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:33,240
- We need Kil to help us get out of here.
- I got a better idea.

626
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,140
- I'm going to get backup.
- Wait.

627
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:49,380
Go to Miranda first. She's MI6.
Warn her to get out.

628
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:51,250
And what are you gonna do?

629
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,650
Unfinished business.

630
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:09,410
So you live to die another day...

631
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,870
colonel.

632
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,750
At last. I was beginning to
think you'd never guess.

633
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:19,820
Was it painful?

634
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:23,450
- The gene therapy?
- You couldn't possibly imagine.

635
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,320
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

636
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:29,320
But there have been compensations.

637
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:32,430
Like watching you flail
around in your ignorance.

638
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:35,570
Granting you life just to
see if you'd get wise.

639
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:37,790
It's been fun.

640
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,970
Well, the fun is about
to come to a dead end.

641
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,970
We only met briefly, you and I...

642
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,740
but you left a lasting impression.

643
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:51,780
When you forced me to present
the world with a new face...

644
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:56,150
I chose to model the disgusting
Gustav Graves on you.

645
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,120
Just in the details.

646
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:04,130
That unjustifiable swagger.

647
01:28:04,330 --> 01:28:09,270
Your crass quips, a defense mechanism
concealing such inadequacy.

648
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:12,030
My defense mechanism is right here.

649
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:20,310
So, Miss Frost is not all she seems.

650
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:23,480
Looks can be deceptive.

651
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:27,350
Yes.

652
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:31,520
Did you find out who
betrayed you in North Korea?

653
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,120
Only a matter of time.

654
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:37,790
You never thought of looking
inside your own organization?

655
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:44,130
She was right under your nose.

656
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:50,800
It was so good of you to
bring your gun to bed.

657
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,250
Yes. Occupational hazard.

658
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,350
You see, I have a gift.

659
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:03,340
An instinct for sensing
people's weaknesses.

660
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:07,390
Yours is women. Hers and mine
is winning, whatever the cost.

661
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:11,530
When I arranged for the fatal overdose
of the true victor at Sydney...

662
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:15,180
I won myself my very own MI6 agent...

663
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,940
using everything at my disposal:
Her brains, her talent...

664
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,300
even her sex.

665
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:26,370
The coldest weapon of all.

666
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:31,200
Hello.

667
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:33,870
Miranda?

668
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,750
There will be others after me.

669
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,450
You mean your American friend, Jinx.

670
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:51,100
Soon to be the victim of a tragedy.

671
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:56,570
- An ice palace can be a treacherous place.
- Hand over the toys.

672
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:58,740
Oh, yeah.

673
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,870
You know, I've missed your
sparkling personality.

674
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:08,640
How's that for a punch line?

675
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:10,650
Kill him.

676
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,390
I enjoyed last night, James...

677
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:15,490
but it really is death for breakfast.

678
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:33,400
Kill him, quietly.

679
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,410
Kill him. Now!

680
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:21,090
- He got away.
- No matter.

681
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:23,850
The pleasure of the kill is in the chase.

682
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,620
Bring me the generals.

683
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:38,600
Gentlemen...

684
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:40,970
I promised you a demonstration.

685
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:44,480
Now you will see the true power of Icarus.

686
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:56,390
The Western spy runs, but he cannot hide.

687
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:11,900
Icarus will lock on to the heat signature
and concentrate the sun's power.

688
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:32,950
Hey, boss, he beat your time.

689
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,290
Time to draw the line.

690
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:13,960
Global warming is a terrible thing.

691
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:16,780
Yeah, nice moves, just like Bond.

692
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:20,280
He was pretty vigorous last night as well.

693
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:21,960
He did you?

694
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:25,330
- I didn't know he was that desperate.
- He's not coming for you.

695
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:28,830
He just died running, trying
to save his own skin.

696
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,640
That's pretty good tailoring.

697
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:36,610
I hope it doesn't shrink when it gets wet.

698
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:09,170
Soon, we will be victorious.

699
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:23,550
We've got one hour to wrap this up.
Let's move.

700
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:25,410
Come on, Jinx, where are you?

701
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:35,060
All units report. Now!

702
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:00,580
Warning, adaptive camouflage failure.

703
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:57,260
Time to give the American her bath.

704
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:16,400
Adaptive camouflage restored.

705
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:08,290
Vlad, does the word "ergonomics"
mean anything to you?

706
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,520
Man? Machine?

707
01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:13,930
This is still a suitcase.

708
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,930
Finish it, will you?

709
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,680
Come on, it's warm in here. Come on.

710
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:32,490
The cold kept you alive, huh?
It must've kept you alive.

711
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:34,860
Come on.

712
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:45,370
What took you so long?

713
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:46,540
I'm sorry.

714
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:21,400
Agent Johnson.

715
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:24,780
- James.
- Charles.

716
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:28,380
Okay, bring us up to speed on this.

717
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:33,350
Another division mobilized north of the DMZ.
80,000 troops and counting.

718
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:37,690
- And another million in reserve.
- Moon's father won't allow a war.

719
01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:39,230
General Moon's under arrest.
Hard-liners staged a coup.

720
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:45,090
You deliberately misled
me by implicating Bond.

721
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:48,630
- If you'd told us about your agent...
- She'd be dead.

722
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,960
- Your mole would've made sure.
- We wouldn't have a mole...

723
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:57,130
if you'd told us that Frost and Moon were
on the Harvard fencing team together.

724
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:00,710
Knowing who to trust is
everything in this business.

725
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:03,180
Well, well, James Bond.

726
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:06,880
- Just in time for the fireworks.
- Let's get down to business.

727
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:08,760
We're at DEFCON 2.

728
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,650
And if the North goes south,
they're gonna go south big-time.

729
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,720
You don't just stroll through a minefield.

730
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:19,030
You need some kind of an edge.

731
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:21,460
- Icarus.
- We're taking care of that...

732
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:24,470
with an ASAT launch in one hour.

733
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:28,010
- Where's Graves?
- In a North Korean air base.

734
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:31,410
They're right where we can't touch him.

735
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,650
You can't...

736
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:38,580
- ...but I can.
- Look...

737
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:43,020
we're here in case things escalate,
not to make sure that they do.

738
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:46,960
No incursions into the North.
President gave me a direct order.

739
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:49,760
And when did that ever stop you?

740
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,800
You make your own decision.
I'm sending in 007.

741
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,500
You think I'd leave this in
the hands of the British?

742
01:46:58,710 --> 01:47:00,670
You go with him.

743
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:03,380
Approaching drop zone.

744
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:10,110
Okay, let's go!

745
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:25,000
- They've entered North Korean airspace.
- Relax, Robinson.

746
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:31,260
If our radar can't see those switchblades,
the North Koreans sure as hell can't.

747
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:54,730
Hey, boss, they launched against Icarus.

748
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,920
Leave it on automatic.

749
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:12,580
I hope nobody here is superstitious. That's
one big mirror we're about to break.

750
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:23,250
Oh, my God.

751
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:27,450
Mobilize the South Korean troops.
And get me the president, now!

752
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:29,990
Still no news of Bond?

753
01:48:43,610 --> 01:48:45,310
Vehicles.

754
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:47,910
Some big shots.

755
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:53,950
It's him.

756
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:59,660
- Three hundred meters.
- Windage, one and a half.

757
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:09,030
We gotta get on that plane.

758
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,750
You, have my father brought down.

759
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:43,530
Father...

760
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:48,200
I regret our meeting had to be like this.

761
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:53,160
You can't tell it's me?

762
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:55,300
I don't know you.

763
01:50:57,210 --> 01:51:00,410
You've always found it
difficult to accept me.

764
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:04,070
That made my exile easier to bear...

765
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:06,680
but I never forgot what you taught me.

766
01:51:06,890 --> 01:51:11,290
In war, the victorious
strategist only seeks battle...

767
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:14,430
after the victory has been won.

768
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:20,400
You see, Father, I
remember my Art of War...

769
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,060
and this is what guarantees that victory.

770
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:08,940
My son...

771
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:13,440
What have you done to yourself?

772
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:15,040
Come, Father.

773
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:20,650
Watch the rising of your son.

774
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:51,480
The second that hits the 38th parallel...

775
01:52:51,690 --> 01:52:53,710
hit them with everything we got.

776
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:56,360
That may not be enough.

777
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:13,870
Do you see, Father?

778
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:15,740
Icarus is clearing the minefield...

779
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:18,880
creating a highway for our troops.

780
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:23,590
If the Americans don't run,
Icarus will destroy them.

781
01:53:47,310 --> 01:53:51,110
Japan is a bug waiting to be squashed...

782
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:54,380
and the West will shake with fear.

783
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,590
But the Americans will
send nuclear warheads.

784
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:03,850
Icarus will swat them from the sky.

785
01:54:48,270 --> 01:54:51,040
You will destroy us.

786
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,480
You would kill your own son?

787
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:01,520
The son I knew died long ago.

788
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:23,570
Father... you disappoint me.

789
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,720
Caution. Caution.

790
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:19,900
- Manual.
- Up!

791
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,120
Manual.

792
01:56:27,470 --> 01:56:28,730
- Up! Up!
- Caution.

793
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:31,210
- Manual.
- Come on!

794
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:53,030
Okay, guys.

795
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:55,520
Okay.

796
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,130
I got it.

797
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:05,170
My, my. You get around. Let's see your gun.

798
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:08,400
Left hand.

799
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,140
That's it.

800
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:13,340
That's it.

801
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:15,920
Now drop it.

802
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:20,450
Looks like your friends have bailed.

803
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:30,160
Push on autopilot.

804
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:31,930
Come on.

805
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:34,700
That's it. Good girl.

806
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:57,850
Well, drowning you didn't seem to work.

807
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:00,330
I'll have to try something
more to the point.

808
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:06,060
One thousand meters and closing.

809
02:00:10,490 --> 02:00:13,150
I can read your every move.

810
02:00:17,130 --> 02:00:19,360
Read this.

811
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:21,730
Bitch.

812
02:00:57,140 --> 02:01:01,370
Look, parachutes for the both of us.

813
02:01:04,010 --> 02:01:06,170
Not anymore.

814
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:15,920
You see, Mr. Bond, you
can't kill my dreams.

815
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:21,530
But my dreams can kill you.

816
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:24,430
Time to face destiny.

817
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:43,210
Time to face gravity.

818
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,990
I think I broke her heart.

819
02:02:28,860 --> 02:02:31,630
Looks like we're going down together.

820
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:33,770
Not yet.

821
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:40,260
- Get the back open.
- Okay.

822
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,020
Come on!

823
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:11,660
- Come on.
- I told you I was a jinx.

824
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,060
I should have warned you...

825
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:16,890
my relationships don't last either.

826
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:24,640
At least we're gonna die rich.

827
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:31,510
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.

828
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:33,440
Come on.

829
02:04:53,170 --> 02:04:55,140
Now...

830
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:59,780
you said something about
going down together?

831
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:40,480
James.

832
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:42,510
Moneypenny.

833
02:06:26,930 --> 02:06:29,060
Oh, James.

834
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:41,800
Moneypenny?

835
02:06:43,250 --> 02:06:47,510
I was just testing it out.

836
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:50,810
It's rather hard, isn't it?

837
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:54,790
Yes. Very.

838
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:32,080
Wait, don't pull it out. I'm
not finished with it yet.

839
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:36,250
See? It's a perfect fit.

840
02:07:37,330 --> 02:07:40,560
- Leave it in.
- It's gotta come out sooner or later.

841
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:45,670
No, leave it in, please. Few more minutes?

842
02:07:47,610 --> 02:07:50,700
We really have to get these back.

843
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,650
Still the good guys, huh?

844
02:07:57,890 --> 02:08:02,590
I'm still not quite sure how good you are.

845
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:07,650
I am so good.

846
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:13,000
Especially when you're bad.
