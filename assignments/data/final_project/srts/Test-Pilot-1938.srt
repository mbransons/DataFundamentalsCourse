1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:25,767
There she is,
Mr. Drake.

3
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:29,300
You mean to tell me there's not
Even that much more to do to her?

4
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,334
Not a whisper.

5
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,033
All the years and all the
Wrecks and all the schemes,

6
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,801
And out of it grows
This sweet peach.

7
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, and she's going to
Crack that record by an hour.

8
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,200
You can go and hang it
On your wall right now.

9
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:45,667
And up high,
Gunner-

10
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:48,167
Up where the storms
Can't touch her-

11
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,801
Out of their reach.

12
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:54,767
Something more than
A record, eh, gunner?

13
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,434
She'll spit on
Those mountains.

14
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:58,267
Yes, she will.

15
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:01,434
If she wasn't such
A lady, she would.

16
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:02,901
How's Lane feeling?

17
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,467
He's been asleep
About 3 hours.

18
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:07,968
Uh-huh. 12:00. He's got
To take off at 1:00 sharp.

19
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,968
Yeah. I'll wake him
In about a half-hour.

20
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,234
Oh, yeah. Let him
Have all he can.

21
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,200
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:13,734
Lane
Still asleep?

23
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,300
We won't pay him the 750
Without his cross on this.

25
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:17,801
And you won't pay him if
You don't break the record.

26
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:19,634
Sure. The ad's no good if
He don't break the record.

27
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,934
We're selling gasoline.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,033
Get out. Give me air,
Will you?

29
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,300
Air? Is that what you're
Asking for, gunner?

30
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,801
Have a little on me.

31
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:26,267
Everything grounded
West of albuquerque.

32
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:27,934
Just what you've
Been waiting for.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,801
And look what's waiting
For him over colorado.

34
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,467
It's all right.
He won't be there long.

35
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:32,467
Let me know the minute
He wakes up, will you?

36
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:33,601
All right.
He'll be here.

37
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,634
He ain't going
Anywhere else.

38
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:35,801
I wouldn't
Put it past him.

39
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,467
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,567
Hey! Where's Lane?

41
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,434
Yeah, where? I had a
Date with him at 10:00.

42
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:58,934
You're telling me
Where.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,901
When'd you see him?

44
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:01,267
I'm telling you,
I haven't seen him!

45
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,267
How long you been here? Since 9:00.

46
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:03,734
When'd you
Fall asleep?

47
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:05,434
I don't know. What
Difference does it make?

48
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,601
Don't get so tough about it. I'll
Tell you what difference it makes.

49
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,934
He left for home here 3 hours ago.
I want to know if he's been here.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,467
What time is it?
12:00.

51
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:12,934
I was awake at 11:00, I know that.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,100
Then he hasn't
Been here.

53
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,567
Who are you? The guy
Called gunner?

54
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:17,567
Yeah, and I'm telling you, you
Can't let him out of your sight.

55
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,100
What are you
Telling me for?

56
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,934
I ain't ever seen
So much of him.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,434
You don't think
Anything happened to him?

58
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:23,601
An accident
Or something?

59
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,601
Quiet!

60
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,133
Yeah, an accident-
Another dame.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,300
Oh, yeah. Hello,
Gunner, old boy.

62
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:31,300
Look what I rescued.
Dying of thirst, she said.

63
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,767
Hello, pal. Everything
All right with you?

64
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:34,767
What's your name?

65
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:35,968
Sarah.

66
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,634
Oh? Her name is mable.
Mable, this is sarah.

67
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:40,434
And this is the gunner. And this
Is all a very unexpected pleasure,

68
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,100
And I'm very glad
To know all of you.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,501
Do you know
What time it is?

70
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:44,968
Yeah. Time to go to bed. You
Told me that two hours ago.

71
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,501
What do you want to keep
Repeating yourself for?

72
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:47,968
Come on, girls. Blow.
Get out of here.

73
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,567
I won't go out
With that.

74
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,901
Girls, girls.

75
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,767
Look, this guy's
Got to get some sleep.

76
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,601
Get out of here
Before I throw you out.

77
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,567
Come on. Remember, you girls
Were with me if anybody asks.

78
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:59,934
Girls are
Always quarreling.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,100
Girls don't get on good for some reason.

80
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,234
Girls, girls.

81
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,267
The dear old girls.

82
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:15,567
Jim.
Yeah?

83
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:17,801
Ok. Where are
My clothes? Oh.

84
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,901
I don't know
How you do it.

85
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:24,100
How'd she wind?

86
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,634
2,762.

87
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,934
Good. She ought to bust in my face
Before I get her off the ground.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,934
Yeah. Just like
Those dames of yours.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,100
What dames?

90
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,100
Oh, lord.

91
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,400
How's the weather?

92
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,167
You got a 62-mile tailwind
At 20,000 feet.

93
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:38,234
How's the weather?

94
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,234
You got a 78-mile tailwind
At 25,000 feet.

95
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,033
Yeah? How's that storm over
Colorado? Who you trying to kid?

96
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,133
Ah, what's a little weather
To the Drake bullet?

97
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,100
Oh, Drake's got a new
Name for her now.

98
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,767
Calls her
His sweet peach.

99
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,267
Yeah? Don't tell
Colorado that.

100
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,934
Don't you worry.
She'll hold.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,267
Yeah. I love you guys
That know all about it.

102
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,267
Sure. If you crack up,
You can blame me.

103
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,767
Mm-hmm. I get that
Out of it.

104
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,734
Every time I see a crash
Coming, I know it isn't my fault.

105
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:07,934
That makes it
All right, too.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,300
Sure, sure.

107
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,100
Thank you.
Thank you.

108
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,100
Well, once
Again, Jim.

109
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,267
Yep.

110
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,267
She's in shape.
Like a peach?

111
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:20,767
That's right.
That's right.

112
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,267
She may leave a little
Fuzz along the way,

113
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:25,767
But she'll keep that
Schoolgirl complexion.

114
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,968
This is more than
Just a record, Jim.

115
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,734
It means a whole lot
To aviation.

116
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,434
I never heard of it.
I'm doing it for you, pal.

117
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:34,467
Well, see you tomorrow. All right.

118
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:35,667
In you go.

119
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,801
Go on and break
The record!

120
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:49,133
Take it easy now. Remember, you got
4,200 pounds of gas in this crate.

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,133
Yeah. I'd have never
Thought of that.

122
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,901
If I don't see you again,
It'll be too soon.

123
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:56,734
Yeah, and if I never see
That ugly map of yours again,

124
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,267
It'll be too soon.

125
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,968
Do I look like you?

126
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,467
Huh?

127
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,701
Well, they're both good.
I'll say that for them.

128
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:57,200
What are you going to do
For the next 5 or 6 hours?

129
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,067
Look like
You're looking.

130
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,567
Well, come on.
Let's look together.

131
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,634
Are you all right?

132
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,634
Are you all right?

133
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,934
I'm licked, see? I'm licked! I
Couldn't move this thing with a derrick.

134
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400
Oh. That's too bad.

135
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,133
"that's too bad."
Is it really?

136
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,300
All I had was a coast to coast
Record, and it's too bad.

137
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,734
Don't you understand?
I had it licked to death.

138
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,234
Why, I had it right in my
Hand, just like that wrench.

139
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,467
And now you haven't
Even got the wrench.

140
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,300
Say, where are we?

141
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:17,767
We are in kansas.

142
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,275
That's great.
How near wichita?

143
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:21,267
About 20 miles.

144
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:22,801
I'll tell you what you can do
For me. Do you live around here?

145
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:23,767
Right there.

146
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,467
You got a phone?
Yes.

147
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:27,067
All right. Go call the union
Air terminal at burbank.

148
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,133
Ask for gunner morris. When you get
Him, just yell down, and I'll come.

149
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,167
Johnny morris?

150
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:32,534
Gunner! Gunner.

151
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,767
Just ask for gunner. Tell
Him I'm calling. I'm Jim Lane.

152
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,133
That's all
You have to do.

153
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,667
Why don't you
Call him yourself?

154
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:39,167
Hey, I got to get
These lines out of here.

155
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:41,334
You don't think I want to be stuck
In this dump all night, do you?

156
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,934
I don't care very much
One way or the other.

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,167
All right, all right!
I'll pay for it.

158
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:48,133
Don't worry about that.

159
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,501
Listen, swellhead, you're
On private property,

160
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,100
And very uninvited.

161
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,434
How'd you like to get
That junk over the fence

162
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,801
Before I sic
A bull on you?

163
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,133
Say, I'm just in the mood
For a bull, sister.

164
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,501
You go get him. I'm liable to pick him
Up and throw him right back in your lap.

165
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:10,834
I know you.
You're the prince-

166
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,167
A nice,
Charming prince,

167
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,968
Right out of
The sky-

168
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,334
A young girl's
Dream.

169
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,000
And I've been waiting
For you all my life.

170
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:24,334
That's why no other man ever
Touched the tip of my finger.

171
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,467
I have lived
For a prince.

172
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:33,334
What's the matter?
Too much for you?

173
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,667
You're a funny-looking gazabo.

174
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:40,667
Yeah.

175
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:43,167
Are you a famous
Flier, Mr. Lane?

176
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:44,801
Why, I'm Jim Lane.

177
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:47,634
Should I faint
On that one?

178
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,133
Say, where
Do you live?

179
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,834
I still live there. I haven't
Moved since I told you.

180
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,968
Can I use your phone?

181
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:01,634
It's all right with me if
It's all right with the phone.

182
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,667
What's your name?

183
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,567
Ann barton.

184
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:09,767
And we're near wichita, are we, ann?

185
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:11,601
And it's still
20 miles.

186
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,267
That's right. You told me
That before, too, didn't you?

187
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:15,601
What time is it?

188
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:16,801
About 6:00.

189
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:18,801
Didn't ask you that
Before, did I?

190
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,133
No. Don't
Startle me so.

191
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,133
Do all the girls around
Here look like you

192
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,467
This early
In the morning?

193
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,801
Every girl I've ever seen this ear-

194
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:29,601
Yeah. Look at
All the hay.

195
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,133
That's wheat.

196
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,801
Oh.

197
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:34,434
The staff of life.

198
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,467
Is it?

199
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,834
It's nice here
At that, isn't it?

200
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,934
I'm so glad
You like it.

201
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:43,801
How many waffles
Can you eat, Mr. Lane?

202
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:44,834
How many
Have you got?

203
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,133
That's all
I want to know.

204
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Come along.
Keep following me.

205
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:53,267
Hey, where did you get such
A nice father and mother?

206
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,267
I took time
Picking them out.

207
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,400
Oh.

208
00:13:56,467 --> 00:14:00,601
Say, this is a pretty
Room. This your room?

209
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,067
No. This is
The spare room.

210
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,901
Oh. This is where I'd
Stay if I were a guest.

211
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:07,067
That's right...

212
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,934
If you were
Stuck here.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,100
Hmm.

214
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:13,934
Oh.

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,934
What's the matter?

216
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,601
No towels.
I'm stuck.

217
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:17,801
Oh, dear.

218
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:20,000
You're not supposed
To say "oh, dear."

219
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,934
You should say,
"that's all right."

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,334
I've been around here too long
Now not to say what I mean.

221
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,634
Quite an imagination
For an aviator.

222
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,300
Can't match yours, pal.
You went to school.

223
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,968
I didn't
Learn it there.

224
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,467
Don't get lost.

225
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,634
No, no. I won't.

226
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,834
Ann keeps all those
Records in the books.

227
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:06,267
Ann went to school.

228
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,267
Smart. Ann graduated from the
State university, Mr. Lane,

229
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:09,601
With the highest
Honors.

230
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:10,601
Didn't you, ann?

231
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,067
Oh, you bet.

232
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,767
I broke all records.

233
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,067
Did you go
To college, Mr. Lane?

234
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,100
Ha ha ha!

235
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,767
Why, ann!
Why, mother!

236
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,300
She's crazy. I broke
All records, too.

237
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,434
I entered high school a
Sophomore and came out a freshman.

238
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:23,467
Have you been a test pilot ever since?

239
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:25,467
No. I was in the army for a
While, but we didn't agree.

240
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:26,734
Had to get up
Too early?

241
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,267
No. Had to
Go to bed.

242
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,734
That must be
Your call.

243
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,334
Yeah, thanks. No wisecracks
Now. I beat you to it.

244
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,300
He's
A charming man.

245
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,300
Uh-huh.

246
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,300
Yeah. Yeah?

247
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

248
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:48,501
The oil pump let go. He's
Down ok on a farm near wichita.

249
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:52,667
Well, that's
The way it goes.

250
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,033
Yeah.

251
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,467
And bring along a whole new
Assembly and the center line.

252
00:15:58,367 --> 00:15:59,767
Yeah. Wait.
I'll find out.

253
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,801
Oh, ann?

254
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:02,334
Who's ann?

255
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,834
Yes?

256
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:06,434
Will anyone in wichita with a cab
Know how to get here all right?

257
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,767
Oh, sure. Due west of wichita
On the main highway.

258
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,934
Everybody knows
The barton farm.

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,400
Oh, sure. Due west of
Wichita on the main highway.

260
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,200
Everybody knows
The barton farm.

261
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,801
What's all this
"ann" stuff?

262
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:20,767
Listen, have you got all
That dope now, or haven't you?

263
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,767
What time will you
Get in wichita?

264
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,767
I'll hop the first trip east.
The weather's cleared.

265
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,467
Wichita? Wait a minute.

266
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,467
5:30 your time.

267
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:33,033
Why do you always have to
Land way out in the sticks?

268
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey, this isn't
The sticks, lad.

269
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,300
This is the prettiest farm I ever saw.

270
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:40,434
Wait'll you see it. The
Wheat sways in the field

271
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,634
Like a silken sea.

272
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:42,834
How's that?

273
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,601
Sounds like a blond.

274
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,367
Listen, don't fool around
There all afternoon.

275
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:49,601
Get that old pump out of there, will you,
So I can put the new one in right away?

276
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,100
Maybe we can pull
Out of there tonight.

277
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,901
Oh, sure. Sure. I'll
Work on it all afternoon.

278
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,767
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

279
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,267
All afternoon.

280
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:02,434
Yeah. Ok. Good-bye.

281
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,734
All set. Have we
Got a car?

282
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,267
Yes. Why?

283
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,234
We got to go to wichita, haven't we?

284
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Oh.

285
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,901
We got to meet the gunner, haven't we?

286
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:14,100
Oh. And he arrives
There when?

287
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,934
Around 5:00
This afternoon.

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,934
And in the meanwhile?

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,901
I'll entertain you
There.

290
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:22,567
Oh. I thought you
Had to work here.

291
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,100
Oh, no, no.
That's hard work.

292
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,634
Come on.
Come on, pal.

293
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,434
We're wasting time.
Wichita is calling.

294
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:28,767
Here. Come on.

295
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,267
And wear that
Red dress, will you?

296
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:31,467
What?

297
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,434
How did you know
I had a red dress?

298
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:36,334
Oh, I got
In the wrong room.

299
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:43,734
Good-bye, father.
Good-bye, mother.

300
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,133
Bye. You all be back
For supper?

301
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,100
We will.

302
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,133
And, Mr. Lane?

303
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,300
Yes, mother?

304
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,801
I'll have a cot all
Fixed up for your friend.

305
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,367
All right, mother. And
The towels are in the hall.

306
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:52,367
What?

307
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:53,601
Shh! Shut up!

308
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,367
Horseshoe!
Horseshoe!

309
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,234
Beautiful!
Beautiful!

310
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,267
Oh!

311
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:08,601
You can see now why wichita's
Going to win this league.

312
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,734
What's that
You say, lady?

313
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:11,234
Wichita's going to
Win what?

314
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,901
It's in the bag, omaha,
And you're holding it.

315
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,067
Yeah. That was
A smart play, eh?

316
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,868
The smartest play you've
Seen today, mister.

317
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:19,868
Ask your pitcher what's
The last thing he expected,

318
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,534
And he'll tell you
A hit and run.

319
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,033
What a beauty!

320
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,767
Two outs,
A man on first,

321
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,868
And 3 and 1
On the batter. Yeah.

322
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:29,100
And that second baseman
Isn't surprised much.

323
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,167
Look at him! He can't
Get over it!

324
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:33,033
I think this guy is right.
It was horseshoed.

325
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,033
Why, sure. Listen. See, it's the
Luckiest ball club in the business.

326
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,934
It's kept them up there
All year.

327
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,767
What's the matter,
Second baseman?

328
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,534
Can't you get over
The surprise?

329
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,300
I see what you mean. You mean wichita's
Been getting breaks like this all year?

330
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,968
All year. I never seen
Anything like that.

331
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,601
Your girl
Is just prejudiced.

332
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:54,534
Women don't know anything
About baseball, anyway.

333
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,801
What's all this?

334
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,267
Watch the game, pal.
Watch the game.

335
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,133
There they are.

336
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,267
Yeah. We're
Just in time.

337
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,601
I love you.

338
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,267
"I love you, too."

339
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:19,267
I love you, too.

340
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:23,434
Shh!

341
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:35,634
Look, Jim. Look at that.
Look at that!

342
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,767
Could you do that?

343
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:43,601
Will you stop? Look at
All the space he's taking.

344
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,968
Well, there's
Plenty of it.

345
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:46,968
Come on.

346
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,000
Where?

347
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,167
Never mind.

348
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:55,701
How do you like it?

349
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:57,200
Oh, it's great!

350
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,334
Whoo!

351
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, that was
Wonderful!

352
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,834
Simply wonderful.

353
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:46,801
Oh!

354
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:47,834
Whoops!

355
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:49,133
Take it easy, pal. Take it easy.

356
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,667
You all right?

357
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:54,801
Oh, yes.
I'm all right.

358
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:56,300
But I'm all right now.

359
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:57,300
Oh!

360
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,434
Thanks, ray.
Whoa! Whoa.

361
00:20:58,501 --> 00:20:59,667
Well!

362
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,701
Hello, darling.

363
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,701
I'm in no mood
For gags.

364
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,133
Shake hands
With ann instead.

365
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,968
Oh, you only got
One this time, huh?

366
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,100
Where's mable?

367
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,801
She must have seen
Your picture somewhere.

368
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,267
Hello, hello, hello.

369
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:18,133
Where did you
See each other?

370
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,133
I picked her off a cloud
And got dizzy. Come on.

371
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Thanks, pal.

372
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,634
Hey.

373
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:27,601
What?

374
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,334
Do you know what
I'm thinking about?

375
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,167
Am I in it?

376
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:34,667
It's a wish.

377
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:38,000
Ohh. What?

378
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:40,834
That it was
This morning again.

379
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,501
Could you do it all over again tomorrow?

380
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,000
Could you?

381
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:48,501
I never had a better
Time, ann. And you?

382
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,501
The best.

383
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,601
There's a new show
There tonight.

384
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:53,601
Where?

385
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,067
Wichita.

386
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,767
Oh. How about
Your friend?

387
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:00,100
You want him
To go with us?

388
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,467
No.

389
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,467
You're going to have
A nice sleep tonight, pal.

390
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:12,267
Yeah.

391
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:14,968
Did you get
That pump off? No.

392
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:15,968
No, I didn't.

393
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,300
That's fine.
That's fine.

394
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:18,801
I had to go to wichita, didn't I?

395
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:19,801
Oh, sure. Sure.

396
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:20,801
I had to meet you,
Didn't I?

397
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:21,801
Oh, yeah. Sure.

398
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:22,801
I didn't want you
To get lost, did I?

399
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:23,968
No, no, no, no.

400
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:25,133
Be a little
Grateful then.

401
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,634
Grate-for what?

402
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:28,133
Aren't you glad
To meet ann?

403
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,634
Sure, I'm glad
To meet ann.

404
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:30,601
Sure, I'm gl-

405
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,667
Ha ha!

406
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:34,334
Any chance of getting
Out of here tonight?

407
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,667
Nah. Not a chance. Wait'll
You see where she lives.

408
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:42,300
Oh, a little house sailing along
All by itself in a sea of wheat.

409
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:45,000
And a cute little cot
For you to sleep on.

410
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,334
Yeah. And wait'll you
Smell them honeysuckles.

411
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,267
Don't give me that banjo. What
Time can we get out tomorrow?

412
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:53,901
Well, I'm ready
Whenever you are.

413
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:57,300
That's all I wanted to know.
We're leaving early.

414
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:02,334
You usually at least bring
The ship home when you flop,

415
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,467
But maybe you ain't
Jim Lane after all.

416
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:07,167
Ok, chicago. Should've
Been with me this morning.

417
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:09,167
Had them colorado
Mountains melting.

418
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:11,467
And tomorrow morning, I'll
Have that ship in new york

419
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:13,434
Before you can
Pack up your tools.

420
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:19,934
Oh.

421
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,300
What?

422
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,767
Joe.

423
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,133
Oh.

424
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,133
My sweetheart.

425
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,467
Oh. This is new.
She's got a sweetheart.

426
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:29,801
Yeah.

427
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,267
And he's
Sweet, too.

428
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,300
I wonder what
He's doing here.

429
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:36,133
He's probably here
To see you.

430
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,133
Yes.

431
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,868
Tell him he'll
Do better tomorrow.

432
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:40,000
Hello!

433
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:41,200
Hello.

434
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:45,501
Hello, Mr. Lane. You look
Just the way you ought to.

435
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,467
Hi, Joe.

436
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:47,834
Joe, this
Is gunner.

437
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:48,834
Hello.

438
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:50,334
Hello, Joe.
Glad to see you.

439
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,734
Gee, you
Had me worried.

440
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,133
I thought you'd forgotten about tonight.

441
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,767
Oh. Is it tonight?

442
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,734
Yes. Did you
Forget?

443
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,667
We're having
A dance, Mr. Lane.

444
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:00,801
Wouldn't you both
Like to come?

445
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:04,367
No. I'm afraid
We can't get away.

446
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:06,434
I'll get you
Some nice girl.

447
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,601
I don't think
They'd like it.

448
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,434
Come on.
Wait for me, Joe.

449
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:15,300
Oh, thanks for
A lovely afternoon.

450
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,467
Yes, sir. Ain't noplace
Like the country.

451
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:25,634
Hear them sounds
And smell them smells.

452
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:29,300
Hmm. Honeysuckle.

453
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,834
Honeysuckle
And raspberries.

454
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,934
Hello.

455
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,968
Oh, hello, Mr. Lane.
Are you still up?

456
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:06,934
Hello.
How are you?

457
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,067
What have you
Been doing?

458
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:14,901
Sitting here
And thinking.

459
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:16,734
Oh.

460
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,234
It's nice here.

461
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,934
Yes, it is
Nice here.

462
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And she's decided to stay
At last, haven't you, ann?

463
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,767
Where was she going?

464
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,801
I was going
To the moon.

465
00:25:29,868 --> 00:25:31,267
Mr. Lane will
Tell you about that.

466
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:33,300
He's been nearer
Than you have.

467
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,100
Uh, what is
The altitude record?

468
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,133
I don't know. It changes all the time.

469
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,234
What's all
The smiling about?

470
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,968
I've been trying to win ann
For a long time, Mr. Lane,

471
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:51,634
But she very frankly told
Me she wanted someone better,

472
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:53,267
And my understanding
Of that

473
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,300
Is probably why
I won her tonight.

474
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,200
I don't get you.

475
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:59,167
We're going to
Be married.

476
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,167
All right. All right.

477
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:07,067
The prince
Is puzzled.

478
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,434
What do you call him
The prince for?

479
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,267
Well, isn't he?

480
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:13,567
They used to ride white
Horses over some hill,

481
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,234
But nowadays they go so
Fast, they can't see straight.

482
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,934
Gee whiz, they go right
Around the world like that

483
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,934
Until they're right back over the hill

484
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,400
Where they
Started.

485
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,434
Do you know
What she means?

486
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,467
No.

487
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:26,734
I don't either.

488
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:31,133
When she talks like this,
Mr. Lane, I just let her go.

489
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,634
Now, Joe, kiss me
Good night.

490
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:34,634
I'm tired.

491
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:35,767
Right.

492
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,801
Good night, Mr. Lane,
And good-bye.

493
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:39,100
Good night, Joe.
Good luck.

494
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,501
Thanks.

495
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,267
Good night, dear.

496
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:44,968
Good night.

497
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:59,434
She must have heard that talk
About a horse, and she's sore.

498
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:02,234
Good night!

499
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,767
Good night.

500
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,434
He's a nice fellow.

501
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,434
Did anyone ever
Nickname you "nice"?

502
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,601
No. Why?

503
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,434
It seems to be
Your favorite word.

504
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:20,634
He's still
A nice fellow.

505
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,767
And you think I made
A nice choice.

506
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:31,400
This is the life.

507
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,267
Sitting out here tonight's
The first time

508
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:36,601
I've ever felt peace
Since I was born.

509
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,567
It's a nice life.

510
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,767
I mean, it's fine.
Hey, you're a flip, girl.

511
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:44,634
Ha ha ha!

512
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:48,400
You're charming.

513
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,234
Yeah.

514
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,567
You turn your head like
A big bear and just gaze.

515
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,901
It looks as if you
Were making up your mind

516
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:59,400
Whether you'd jump
At somebody or not,

517
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:03,267
And then you just
Decide not to.

518
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,467
It's very charming.

519
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:07,467
Mm-hmm.

520
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:09,167
You've got me
Watching for it

521
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,400
And thinking up things
To make you do it.

522
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:12,400
Look.

523
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:13,801
I'll show you.

524
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:15,434
I'm you.

525
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,434
And somebody
Says something,

526
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:20,167
And you go, "hmm?"

527
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, if that isn't going out of
Your way to get a laugh, I ask you.

528
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:33,934
Hey!

529
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,934
There. Ha ha! That's the way you do it.

530
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,167
Sure.

531
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:43,834
I'd go out of my way
Any day to get that.

532
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:46,801
What are you going to
Marry that guy for?

533
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:48,467
You don't love him.

534
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:50,934
What makes you
Suddenly say that?

535
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,234
Just the way
You're behaving now-

536
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,501
Like a little flirt.

537
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,033
I don't like you
For saying that.

538
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,367
That's tough. Look at the
Way you behaved all day.

539
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:03,234
One minute, you're going
To a show with me tonight.

540
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,400
The next, you get yourself
Engaged to him.

541
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:08,534
And then the minute he goes,
You're like this again.

542
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:11,434
Sure. That's right.

543
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,200
That's me.

544
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:15,868
Yeah.

545
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:20,267
And I rated you the
Best girl I ever saw.

546
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:21,968
It's rotten to be
Disappointed.

547
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,734
You'll be gone
In the morning.

548
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:26,267
It will soon
Be here.

549
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,601
I wish
I got out tonight.

550
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,267
I wish
I'd never landed.

551
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:32,467
I wish
I never saw you.

552
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:36,901
What do you think
I wish?

553
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:38,634
Do you think
I like this?

554
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:41,167
What are you
Trying to say now?

555
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:42,634
All my life,
I've waited

556
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:44,167
For this morning
To come

557
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:45,667
Because I thought
It had come.

558
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,467
I thought
It had brought

559
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:49,801
What I'd longed for
So long.

560
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:51,767
Well, I was wrong.

561
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,300
It was just
A day to you.

562
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:56,601
All right,
You don't love me.

563
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,334
What of it?

564
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:01,400
What did you get
Engaged to him for,

565
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,901
If that's the way
You feel?

566
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,901
Because I'm going to
Forget you-

567
00:30:04,968 --> 00:30:06,400
Because he's fine-

568
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:09,534
Because I'm going to be a
Farmer's wife and a good one,

569
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,200
And don't kid yourself I'm not.

570
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,667
I'm grateful to you

571
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:14,701
For making me
Forget dreams,

572
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,334
For giving me peace.

573
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,801
Is that clear, or do you
Want me to blueprint it?

574
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:22,801
What do you want me
To do-say I love you?

575
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,667
No! Not in
A million years...

576
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:28,667
If your heart were
Tearing for me.

577
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:31,334
I'd like to see you
Get me now.

578
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,834
It's over-complete.

579
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:37,167
It was a thrill to see
You come out of the sky.

580
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:38,801
It will be
A greater one

581
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:40,534
To see you
Disappear in it.

582
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:42,734
You better
Get up early...

583
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,501
Because
It will be early.

584
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,033
Well...

585
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,033
Give my regards
To Joe.

586
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,033
What will I tell him?

587
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,968
You don't need anybody to talk for you.

588
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:18,467
Give my love
To the wichita team.

589
00:32:05,868 --> 00:32:08,801
Well, he got away,
All right.

590
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:10,300
Yeah.

591
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:11,767
When do you go?

592
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,300
Right away.

593
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,300
Catch the first
Transport out.

594
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,801
Oh.

595
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,300
Then you'll want
Somebody to...

596
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:21,300
Drive you to wichita.

597
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:28,467
Never mind, pal.
Never mind.

598
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,801
You'll be glad
In the end.

599
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,767
Ann!

600
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,534
Ann!

601
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:46,367
All right, mother.

602
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,300
I- I forgot my hat!

603
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,834
Jim, you didn't.

604
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:51,300
What?

605
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:52,767
You didn't forget
Your hat.

606
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,234
What did I forget?

607
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,767
You forgot me.

608
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,267
What are you
Talking about?

609
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:58,634
You did.
You couldn't go.

610
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:00,434
You came back.
You couldn't go.

611
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:02,434
Well, then get in.
Don't ask any questions.

612
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,934
Let's get
Out of here.

613
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,267
Get in? How?

614
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,634
Here.

615
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:12,968
You'll be sorry
For this.

616
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,701
All right.

617
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:20,300
Not a word anywhere.
It's a crash.

618
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:21,801
Who have you
Sent out?

619
00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:23,300
Oh, everybody.
Everybody!

620
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:24,801
He isn't worth it,
Either.

621
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:26,300
What are you
Talking about?

622
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:28,300
Oh, I don't know what I'm talking about.

623
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,834
Here he comes.

624
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:36,100
What is this?

625
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,467
I give up.

626
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,801
You know her?

627
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,968
Yes, sir.

628
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:41,267
Well, who is she?

629
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:42,801
The girl he left
This morning.

630
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:44,100
Oh, I give up.

631
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,467
Won't do any good.

632
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:46,901
Send him
Into my office.

633
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:48,701
That may do me
Some good.

634
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,234
That's all, frank.

635
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,267
This is my wife,
Gunner.

636
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:58,267
Oh, I've heard so much
About the gunner.

637
00:34:58,334 --> 00:35:00,234
It's almost as if
I'd seen you before.

638
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,734
Now, wait a minute. I
Can't take any more today.

639
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,234
Just tell me about it
As it happened, will you?

640
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,767
I went back for her. We
Were married in indianapolis,

641
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,434
And now we're
With you again.

642
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,601
Married, huh?

643
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,901
Yeah. Where's Drake?

644
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:13,434
He's waiting
To congratulate you.

645
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:16,267
Hang on to her for me, will
You? I got to get some dough.

646
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:17,767
Gee, you must be
Surprised.

647
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:20,133
No, no, I'm not surprised.
I wouldn't be surprised

648
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,601
If he got married in indianapolis
And divorced in toledo.

649
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,334
I'm surprised
You didn't.

650
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:26,901
Now, listen to this.

651
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:28,400
You start out.

652
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,133
You're off on
A great adventure,

653
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,634
Carrying with you

654
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:34,334
The best we can give
You in work and hope.

655
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,968
You're due here
In 7 hours,

656
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:39,968
And aviation's supposed
To be advanced 7 years,

657
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,467
And what happens?

658
00:35:41,534 --> 00:35:45,467
You arrive here 37 hours
Late and with a girl.

659
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:46,934
Now, I ask you!

660
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,934
Ha ha ha! Yeah,
But how she fits it-

661
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,234
You know,
One peach to another.

662
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,267
You're going to test that
Thompson racer on thursday.

663
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:57,767
Tomorrow's tuesday.

664
00:35:57,834 --> 00:36:00,767
That will give you a couple
Of days for a honeymoon.

665
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:03,267
Well, the best of luck
To you. How's that?

666
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:05,734
Well, how about a couple
Of hundred in advance?

667
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:06,901
All right.

668
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:09,000
Right. I'll see you
A week from thursday.

669
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,033
No, no, no, no, no!
This thursday.

670
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,067
I heard you-
A week from thursday.

671
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:15,767
I'm sorry. The national air
Races won't wait for a honeymoon!

672
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,267
This thursday!

673
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,734
Right-a week
From thursday.

674
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,767
Lane!

675
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:20,767
Yeah?

676
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,234
Wait a minute.

677
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,267
Yes, sir.

678
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:26,801
If Jim Lane asks
For any money,

679
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:29,167
Tell him he's no longer on the payroll.

680
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:31,234
Yes, Mr. Drake.

681
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,901
You can still
Change your mind.

682
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:34,467
Who'll you get
In my place?

683
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:35,634
Benson!

684
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,634
Ha ha! You'll
Change yours.

685
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:40,300
Say, Jim, you've got
The idea in your head

686
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,968
You're the only aviator
In the world, haven't you?

687
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:46,300
No, but you have.
Ha ha ha!

688
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,200
There's
Lane's dough.

689
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:56,734
He's got all
The answers, too.

690
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:58,200
Tell barney
To study it

691
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,634
And then come in here
And see me.

692
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,300
Well, I got it.

693
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:05,501
How much?

694
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:07,901
The gate. Yeah, he's
Pulled a lot of beauties,

695
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,767
But this one he dressed up for the ball
- I'm fired.

696
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:12,734
Jim! Jim, fly for me.
Fly mine.

697
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:14,767
I've got the fastest ship
In the world.

698
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,234
Hello, stuart.
Oh, and get this-

699
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,734
Listen, Jim, I've given 3
Good years designing that ship.

700
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,267
If I win the thompson,
I'll have a factory in a year!

701
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:22,767
Hey, grant,
Hey, hey.

702
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:25,267
You know I'm broke, Jim.
I can't give you any dough,

703
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:27,767
But if you win,
The whole 10 grand is yours!

704
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,267
How can he fire you? We're
Testing the racing job on thursday.

705
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,267
I don't feel like
Testing it thursday.

706
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:33,267
Listen, Jim-

707
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,801
Hey, look, look,
Will you blow?

708
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:36,901
Come on, gunner. Don't
Be that way. Come see her!

709
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,467
Every day's like this,
So don't worry.

710
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:40,767
Charming.

711
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,267
I saw her
Before she started.

712
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:43,767
And you said
She was fast.

713
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,434
You ok'd all that dope.
Remember, gunner?

714
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:48,434
Yeah, yeah, and I told you
Ought to run her on dope, too.

715
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:49,968
Remember? She's fast,
And she's crazy.

716
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:54,701
Oh, he's kidding you.
It's a good boat.

717
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:56,234
No, no.
It's too fast.

718
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,968
You know, I like them slow
And steady. What do you say?

719
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,467
I got a wife and $10.
What more do you want?

720
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:02,934
Got me beat
Both ways.

721
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,467
And I know
What I've got.

722
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:06,868
I thought you were pretty crazy
Without thinking, darling,

723
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,734
But I didn't know
You were that crazy.

724
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,501
Jim! Jim,
If I buy a drink,

725
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,300
Will you take
A look at her?

726
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:14,734
No, but if you buy two
Drinks, we'll sit in her.

727
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:16,767
If I buy 3 drinks,
Will you race her?

728
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,234
No!

729
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,067
Glad to have met you.

730
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,267
You mean I'm
As crazy as that?

731
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:25,767
You're worse, honey.

732
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:27,767
Gunner, he buys
A ring for 600.

733
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:30,601
He marries a girl.
He has $10 in the world.

734
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:33,167
He loses his job,
And he comes out laughing.

735
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:34,767
Yeah, it's all
Very funny.

736
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:37,267
We're wasting time. How much
Dough have you really got?

737
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:39,467
I had 200 coming, but
That was this morning.

738
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:40,601
Well, who took it?

739
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:41,634
Indianapolis.

740
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:43,968
All right, I'll
Cut you in on the 10.

741
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
What will we do first?
We've got to get a house.

742
00:38:48,267 --> 00:38:49,801
Don't you live anywhere,
Darling?

743
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:52,567
No. Gunner and I move around.
We've got our clothes in a room.

744
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:55,400
There's some apartments over on 81st
Street we'd like. Let's grab one.

745
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,067
Don't you have to pay
Anything in advance?

746
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,067
No.

747
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,234
How do you know?

748
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,400
I don't know. I just
Know that you don't.

749
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:02,868
How are you,
Gunner, old boy?

750
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:05,234
Oh, I'm great. I got the
Whole thing figured out.

751
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,567
I'm going to be associated
With two nuts instead of one.

752
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,234
Why, gunner.
Why, gunner.

753
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,567
What are you
Looking at?

754
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:12,934
I found a dime.

755
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:15,767
Ooh, it's nice.

756
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:16,934
We'll take it.

757
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,434
Darling, we've only seen
This room.

758
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:20,067
We'll look
At the rest of it.

759
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:22,100
I think that would be a very good idea.

760
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,434
The doors work good.

761
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,267
What do you think
Of this room, dear?

762
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:26,434
I think it's fine.

763
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:27,767
I'm glad you do.

764
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:29,734
Does he always take
Everything like this?

765
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,234
He's inclined to. He's very
Much of a hurry-up gentleman.

766
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,734
They're the very first to
Complain if anything goes wrong.

767
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:36,267
Does philosophy go
With the joint,

768
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:38,267
Or do we get that
On the side?

769
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,234
Come on, dear. Let's
Look at the kitchen.

770
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,767
Yeah, ok.
Oh. Ok!

771
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,767
I think we'd like
To have it very much.

772
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:46,300
The faucets
Are nice.

773
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:50,000
That will be one month in advance, please
- $150.

774
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:54,300
Ahem. It's your turn to turn
On the speed, isn't it, pal?

775
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:56,300
He's a crazy loon,
Isn't he?

776
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:57,801
He's a test pilot.

777
00:39:57,868 --> 00:40:00,300
Oh, you try airplanes out before we do.

778
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:03,300
Mm-hmm, and they try
Themselves out before I do.

779
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,767
Can I see the kitchen
Again?

780
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:07,300
Surely. If you notice,
It's a brand-new stove.

781
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,267
I wouldn't miss this
For anything.

782
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:11,133
Look, that was
Just an excuse.

783
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,934
I wanted to speak
To you alone.

784
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,934
Oh.

785
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,601
What do you think
Of that girl?

786
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,467
Why, I should think
She's very nice.

787
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:18,801
We just got married.

788
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:20,167
Oh, did you?
Just today?

789
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:21,334
Just now.

790
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,834
Where were you married,
Mr. Lane?

791
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:24,100
Indianapolis.

792
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,834
Indi-maybe you think you're
Still in indianapolis.

793
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:28,334
Huh? Oh, no, dear.
I see what you mean.

794
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,167
No, no, we were
Married in indianapolis

795
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:32,501
A couple of hours ago.
Came here in a plane.

796
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:34,300
Oh, not as crazy
As that, pal, really.

797
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,200
Do I think this is
Indianapolis? Ha ha!

798
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,334
And look, get this.
She never was here.

799
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,100
First time
In new york, see?

800
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:42,501
Well, now, I got to show
Her around good, haven't I?

801
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,501
It takes a little dough,
Right? You said it.

802
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,467
Does this mean you
Can't pay me in advance?

803
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:48,334
No, no, no. Don't bother
About that, honey.

804
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,734
Look, I want to borrow
A hundred bucks from you.

805
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,133
Mr. Lane.

806
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,400
Well, next week I'll
Have plenty of dough.

807
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:56,200
In my business,
You make it that way.

808
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm always in the hole from 5 to 10
Grand, and then I pay it back in one sweep.

809
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:00,334
I don't owe
Anybody yet.

810
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,534
But, Mr. Lane-

811
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah, listen.
She likes you.

812
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,801
I don't give out the blarney.
You know what I mean by that,

813
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,901
But sometimes
- I want that dough very much.

814
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:10,801
If I didn't like you, I
Wouldn't ask you for a quarter,

815
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,801
But it's fun asking you for dough.
I'm enjoying this, aren't you?

816
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,501
Well, I don't know.

817
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:18,467
Of course, if it's going to leave you
Short, don't give it another thought.

818
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:20,734
Mr. Lane, I have
Exactly $9.00,

819
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:23,801
But you may have it
If it will help you any.

820
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:26,834
Darling, I got you
Beat by a buck.

821
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,634
You keep it. Ann!

822
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:30,667
Yes?

823
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:31,868
A lovely woman.

824
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:34,133
Yes, dear, and did you like
The new stove?

825
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,300
Mm-hmm. She was right.
It's a brand-new stove.

826
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,834
Well, the stove isn't the
Only new thing in this kitchen.

827
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:40,334
I understand
You just married him.

828
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,334
You didn't have no chance
Not to, did you?

829
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,834
Not any,
And neither did he.

830
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:48,300
Glad you're going to
Live here...

831
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,801
I guess.

832
00:41:49,868 --> 00:41:51,467
Ha ha ha!

833
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:54,267
You've got
A new girl.

834
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:57,167
Yeah. I still got the
10, and that's all.

835
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:59,701
I got to stick another
Zero on it somehow.

836
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,968
We don't need any more.
I'll try out the new stove.

837
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:04,400
Gunner!

838
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:11,767
You know, sometime when we might
Be starving to death or something-

839
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,300
But the 9 bucks got me.

840
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:16,300
The minute she pulled out the
Old pocketbook, I knew I was sunk.

841
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,300
I should have known better
Than to listen.

842
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,300
Here, here. Stick it
Away and stop beefing.

843
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:21,801
Save it
For a snowstorm.

844
00:42:21,868 --> 00:42:24,801
How do you like that? I'll bet
You this 10 against that dime

845
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:26,133
He's got this
Before morning.

846
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,801
Oh, what a lovely
Way to live!

847
00:42:27,868 --> 00:42:30,801
Yeah, and if we ever get
Hungry, we can always cook this.

848
00:42:30,868 --> 00:42:32,267
Oh! Right
On the new stove?

849
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:34,801
Mm-hmm. We got a hundred
Bucks, a new house,

850
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:36,801
And a city. Where do we head first?

851
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,300
I'll fix this first.

852
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,767
All right. What do you
Think of it?

853
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,300
This works good.

854
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:43,801
Suits you ok, huh?

855
00:42:43,868 --> 00:42:46,801
Sure. I'll come over and
Visit you from time to time.

856
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,133
Oh, yeah?

857
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,300
Now, this is your room,
Or we don't play.

858
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:52,767
Ok, sucker?

859
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:56,267
Say, uh, it's 6:00. The
Stores close at half past.

860
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:57,767
What stores?

861
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:00,234
Oh, ain't you going to
Buy her anything?

862
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,234
Tomorrow, everything. She
Doesn't need anything tonight.

863
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,767
What's the matter
With you?

864
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,767
She needs a nightgown,
Don't she?

865
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,300
Oh.

866
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,300
She's a lady,
You mug.

867
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:12,300
Yeah. Yeah, I guess she
Does at that, doesn't she?

868
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:14,267
Well,
Be just as well.

869
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:15,801
Yeah, yeah,
You're right.

870
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:18,000
Anything else
You can think of?

871
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,501
Oh, darling, it's
Going to be lovely here.

872
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:25,000
Wait until I've changed it all around.

873
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:28,133
What are you
So serious about?

874
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,767
Say, you've got to buy
Something before we have dinner.

875
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:32,100
Oh, what?

876
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:33,601
A nightgown.

877
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:35,601
Ha ha ha!
Why, darling.

878
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,267
What's the matter?

879
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:39,300
I'm so surprised.

880
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,534
Oh. Ha ha!

881
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,501
Will you buy it
For me?

882
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,000
Me?

883
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:48,501
Please.

884
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,200
Ha ha ha!

885
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:52,767
Where do you
Find them?

886
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,267
Just ask for
The lingerie department.

887
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:56,167
That's all
I'm going to tell you.

888
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:57,434
The lawnja what?

889
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,601
The lingerie department.
Why don't you ask him?

890
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:04,734
Uh, where's the, uh-

891
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:07,767
The lawnjer,
Uh, department?

892
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:09,234
The what, sir?

893
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,734
The lawnjer-

894
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:12,267
Nightgowns!

895
00:44:12,334 --> 00:44:13,801
Oh, for yourself,
Sir?

896
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:15,300
No.

897
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,968
The ladies' department
On the third floor, sir.

898
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,801
Third floor.

899
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:22,667
Well, it ain't
My fault.

900
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:27,467
Here we are, darling.
Now, it's my present,

901
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:30,467
So I'm going to make
Believe I'm not with you.

902
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,968
Go right ahead.

903
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:33,634
Go on.

904
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:36,434
That's right.

905
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:37,767
Hey, come on.

906
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:40,634
Go on, go on. Come on,
Let's get out of here.

907
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:42,601
Go on, will you?
All right now.

908
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,300
Hey.

909
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:48,667
How do you do?

910
00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:50,334
Uh, a nightgown
For a lady.

911
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,267
Yes, sir. What color
Does she fancy, sir?

912
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:53,701
Color?

913
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:58,534
Hey, what color you think
She likes?

914
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:00,534
You can't go wrong
With pink.

915
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:02,067
No? Let's see
The pinks.

916
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:03,534
Yes, sir.

917
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:05,067
She'll think you're
Buying flowers.

918
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:07,767
Here's the very latest
Thing from paris, sir.

919
00:45:07,834 --> 00:45:10,767
This is very pretty
And very reasonable.

920
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,767
How tall is
The young lady?

921
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:14,267
About his size.

922
00:45:14,334 --> 00:45:18,267
36, I'd say. You just feel
The texture of that, sir.

923
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:20,801
It feels all right.
Feel it.

924
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:22,801
It feels good.

925
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:26,467
Yeah, I should say
That's about the right size.

926
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,267
Hey, hey, hey.

927
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:32,300
Yeah, wrap it up.

928
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:33,934
Are you being
Waited on, lady?

929
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Brilliantly.

930
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,501
What's the damage?

931
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,033
$60, please,
Sir.

932
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,300
Well, the "please"
Goes with it, anyway.

933
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:42,634
Say, this is a good business,
Isn't it?

934
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:44,300
We do very well
Here, sir.

935
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,934
Yes, I see
What you mean.

936
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,467
Well, there it is.

937
00:45:47,534 --> 00:45:48,968
Got a good start.

938
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:51,133
It was your idea.
I hope you're satisfied.

939
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,133
Yeah. I'd like to know
What I get out of it!

940
00:45:56,868 --> 00:45:58,734
Thanks. Rural england, the netherlands,

941
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:00,567
France, italy,
Sweden-

942
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:01,801
Sweden!

943
00:46:01,868 --> 00:46:03,767
Yeah, sweden's fine, and
Bulgaria and those burgs.

944
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:06,100
Sweden first. You better
Look up the hotels, gunner.

945
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:08,400
Don't you think we better
Look up a plane

946
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:10,767
To win the race
Before I hire the rooms?

947
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,267
I'm flying for Drake. He'll
Be looking all over town

948
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:14,901
For me by tomorrow,
And you know it.

949
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:16,601
Yeah, and you can't
Lose the race.

950
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:18,767
I might as well switch the
10,000 to swedish dough.

951
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:20,434
Ann, those babies are
All broke over there.

952
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:23,234
Do you realize how much swedish
Dough you can get for 10 grand?

953
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,734
Darling, I happen to know. They'll
Elect you king of something.

954
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:28,634
They won't let us out of town.
We'll hire a castle on the nile.

955
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:29,934
The nile?
The nile?

956
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,300
Whatever their river is.
They've all got a river.

957
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:34,634
And so they have, precious.
Darling, I've got to kiss you.

958
00:46:34,701 --> 00:46:36,133
The only thing
That bothers me-

959
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,100
Why do we go to cleveland at
All and waste all that time?

960
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,801
You don't think
I can lose, do you?

961
00:46:40,868 --> 00:46:41,968
The gunner doesn't,
Either.

962
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:44,100
I don't know.
He lost when he met you.

963
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:45,567
Gunner,
Look what he won.

964
00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:48,133
Watch us, baby, and we'll show
You a little swedish massage.

965
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,234
Hey.

966
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,234
What?

967
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,234
Drake.

968
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,234
Where?

969
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,400
Guy with the hair.

970
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:00,601
Oh.

971
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:01,901
How's it going?

972
00:47:01,968 --> 00:47:03,267
Hello, Jim.

973
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:05,767
Every day will be
Thursday, by and by.

974
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:12,434
He's going to pay
For that.

975
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:13,734
What, dear?

976
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:15,601
Didn't ask me
To come back, did he?

977
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,300
Trying to wait me out. All
Right, I've got another idea.

978
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,234
All right, I got
Nothing more to say.

979
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,234
Yes, I have. I've got one
Thing to say to you, ann.

980
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,467
Yes?

981
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:27,267
Don't let him fly grant's
Ship. It's dangerous.

982
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:28,601
Is it, honey?

983
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:31,100
She's got your number. Don't
Pay any attention to him.

984
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:33,133
I've had to listen
To this for years.

985
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,634
"don't do this." "don't do
That." "don't do anything."

986
00:47:35,701 --> 00:47:37,300
Well, I'm going to
Fly grant's ship,

987
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:39,801
And Drake will rue the day
For being so fresh.

988
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:41,968
How do you like that one-
"rue the day"?

989
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:44,834
I'm picking up words. She
Went to school. Here we are.

990
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,234
Oh, can you spare
A dollar, sweets?

991
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,734
Oh, yeah,
Sure, sure.

992
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:55,701
Here, take it all-
All of $3.00.

993
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:58,567
Oh, no, just a dollar. I
Want to buy a toothbrush.

994
00:47:58,634 --> 00:48:00,367
White teeth-
Don't you want them?

995
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:03,234
$2.20.

996
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,734
$2.20? Ahem.

997
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,434
He's got it.

998
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,200
Oh, wait a minute! Jim,
Don't forget my package!

999
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:12,400
What package?

1000
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:13,434
My nightgown!

1001
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:14,868
Oh! Hey!

1002
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:18,267
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1003
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:20,133
We left a package!

1004
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:32,767
Ha ha ha!

1005
00:48:32,834 --> 00:48:34,267
Well, see you
Later.

1006
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:35,767
Hey, where are you
Going?

1007
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:37,767
I'll go over and pick up our clothes

1008
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,133
Before somebody
Pinches them.

1009
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,801
I'll get everything together
And see you in the morning.

1010
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:44,300
Gunner, where do you wish
I were right now-

1011
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,300
Back in kansas
Sitting on a fence?

1012
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:47,801
Why do you
Say that?

1013
00:48:47,868 --> 00:48:49,300
How long has it been

1014
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,267
Since you've said good night
To him outside?

1015
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:52,734
Believe me, it's a relief. Somebody else

1016
00:48:52,801 --> 00:48:55,734
Can put him to bed for a change.

1017
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:57,901
Gunner, help me
Make you like me.

1018
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,400
Sure, I do.

1019
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:02,400
Don't wish I were
Back on the fence.

1020
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:04,734
You were so dear
To me.

1021
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:07,234
Gee, was it really
Just this morning?

1022
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,734
Don't expect any day
To be any different.

1023
00:49:09,801 --> 00:49:12,734
Just gather thy happiness
While thy mayest.

1024
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:16,267
Must have gone to school
Myself at one time or another.

1025
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:18,434
You big dumb-

1026
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:20,801
Oh, go to bed.

1027
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:33,934
Good afternoon,
Ladies and gentlemen.

1028
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,267
Welcome
To the cleveland airport

1029
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:37,234
For the final day
Of the national air races.

1030
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,234
This is the windup of the greatest series
Of events ever seen at any air race,

1031
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,267
And this afternoon the eyes not only
Of those of us here at the field,

1032
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:46,267
But of the whole world will be
Focused on the grand prix of aviation,

1033
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:48,167
The testing ground
Of both men and planes,

1034
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:50,300
The world's most grueling
Competitive speed race,

1035
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:51,801
The thompson
Trophy race.

1036
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:53,801
There's the army bombardment
Group taking off

1037
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:56,767
For an exhibition of practice
Maneuvers and of dive-bombing.

1038
00:49:56,834 --> 00:49:59,467
The squadron, upon reaching
Their rendezvous...

1039
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:01,734
Ok, Jim, everything is great.
Isn't it, gunner?

1040
00:50:01,801 --> 00:50:04,801
Ok, you just go up there, boy.
You cannot lose!

1041
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,133
Can he, gunner?
Just go up there, boy.

1042
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,267
You cannot lose.
You got the finest-

1043
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,434
Up in the grandstand,
Up in the grandstand.

1044
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:14,801
Yeah, yeah. If you're not here
When I come back, I'll understand.

1045
00:50:14,868 --> 00:50:15,968
Ok, ok.

1046
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:17,467
Yeah, ok, ok.

1047
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:19,801
Ha ha! Well,
Does she go?

1048
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:22,334
She goes,
But don't ask me where.

1049
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,334
Well, this is a funny
Situation, isn't it, Jim?

1050
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,834
You miss me?

1051
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:28,334
Yeah. Is it mutual?

1052
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,834
Well, it doesn't
Seem natural.

1053
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,300
I'll give you
That much.

1054
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:32,767
Benson's all right.

1055
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:34,334
Oh, sure,
Benson's all right.

1056
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,834
He's a little bit
Worried.

1057
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:37,334
Oh?

1058
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,834
Yeah. He says the new ship is so fast

1059
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:42,334
He's afraid the judges won't
Be able to count the laps.

1060
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,334
Ha ha! He spent
The dough already.

1061
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,834
He's taking his family to italy.

1062
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:49,300
How's thursday
Feeling?

1063
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:50,834
Who?

1064
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:52,234
Your pretty wife.

1065
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,601
Oh, yeah! Ha ha!

1066
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,133
Hey, where is
Thursday?

1067
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,467
She's in the grandstand.
Where's friday? In the bar.

1068
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:58,601
No, Jim, no.

1069
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,501
Yeah. We just got
Time for one.

1070
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:04,501
Scotch and a coke.

1071
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:05,701
A coke and a coke.

1072
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:06,868
Hiya, hiya,
Hiya, pal.

1073
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:09,300
Well, hiya, pal. How
Are you? Glad to see you.

1074
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,934
Gunner, do you know
The mighty Benson?

1075
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,300
Oh, yeah-
The parachute jumper.

1076
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,934
You got good seats? Going to be
A nice race to watch.

1077
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,234
The battle for second place
Is going to be vicious.

1078
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,300
My wife's sitting pretty. You can
Buy a lot of seats for 10 grand.

1079
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:22,300
You're a piker.
My wife's here with the kids.

1080
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:24,634
What do you want to
Disappoint all of them for?

1081
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:25,968
I hear you're
Going to italy.

1082
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:27,167
Right from here, Jim.

1083
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:28,734
We'll meet you
In sweden.

1084
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:31,167
I'm not kidding. The missis has
Been harping about the mediterranean,

1085
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:34,200
But this is
The first real dough

1086
00:51:34,267 --> 00:51:36,133
I've ever got ahold of.
Oh, oh, may!

1087
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,501
You know
Jim Lane.

1088
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:38,834
No. Ha ha!

1089
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:40,334
How do you do,
Mrs. Benson?

1090
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,334
And this is the gunner, his mechanic.

1091
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,534
How do you do?

1092
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,000
The boys are drowning their sorrows.

1093
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:46,467
What will you have,
Mrs. Benson?

1094
00:51:46,534 --> 00:51:48,801
I understand we're celebrating
A trip to the mediterranean.

1095
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:50,334
Oh, nothing,
Thanks.

1096
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,267
Oh. And I wish Fred would stop
Talking about the mediterranean.

1097
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:54,934
He's got me
Half-believing it,

1098
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,767
And as for the children,
They might as well be there.

1099
00:51:57,834 --> 00:51:59,267
Daddy!
Daddy!

1100
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:01,801
Look, daddy, all pictures about italy.

1101
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,300
Have you ever
Been to italy?

1102
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:05,801
Mother says the sea
Is bluer than the sky.

1103
00:52:05,868 --> 00:52:07,267
I want a drink!

1104
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:08,801
Ha ha! You want
A drink!

1105
00:52:08,868 --> 00:52:10,300
His father's boy.

1106
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,300
Good-bye. I'm awfully glad
To have met you.

1107
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:13,801
Thank you.
Good-bye.

1108
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:16,634
Attention! Pilots
For the thompson trophy race

1109
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:18,267
On the lines now!

1110
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:21,567
Now, ladies
And gentlemen,

1111
00:52:21,634 --> 00:52:23,267
The big event of the year
In aviation-

1112
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:26,367
The thompson trophy race for
The 10 fastest planes in america.

1113
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,033
20 times around
This closed course

1114
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,734
In aviation's toughest
Competitive speed event.

1115
00:52:29,801 --> 00:52:31,234
Why, it's annie.

1116
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,267
Yes! And to think
I left kansas for this.

1117
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:36,234
I wonder what
Joe's doing now.

1118
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,267
Is this giving me
The laugh?

1119
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:41,334
Mm-hmm. There's a sucker
Born every second, pal.

1120
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,968
Not anymore.
I broke the mold.

1121
00:52:46,234 --> 00:52:47,501
All clear?

1122
00:52:47,567 --> 00:52:48,834
Clear!

1123
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:51,801
Well, you can
Sing a song

1124
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,067
Of 10 grand, a pocketful of dough!

1125
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:55,901
I'll see you
At the bank!

1126
00:52:58,334 --> 00:52:59,767
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do!

1127
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:01,434
I won't!

1128
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:04,767
Oh, darling!

1129
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:05,767
Yeah!

1130
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:08,300
I got a telegram
From the landlady!

1131
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:10,300
Oh, yeah?
What did she say?

1132
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:11,801
She hopes you win!

1133
00:53:11,868 --> 00:53:13,868
Here comes
The first entry racer-

1134
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:15,834
Number 7,
Flown by Jim Lane.

1135
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,133
Lane, you remember, won the
Thompson last year in a Drake special

1136
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,601
And set a new record
Of 259.108 miles per hour.

1137
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:25,000
There's the starter
Holding up his flag.

1138
00:53:25,067 --> 00:53:27,801
Benny strong will be
Flying his number 86.

1139
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:30,167
The timers and judges
Are ready.

1140
00:53:31,868 --> 00:53:33,801
There it goes!
They're away!

1141
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,901
At the conclusion
Of the 16th lap,

1142
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,901
With only 40 miles
Left to go,

1143
00:54:32,968 --> 00:54:34,400
Fred Benson
In his Drake special

1144
00:54:34,467 --> 00:54:37,334
Is still leading the field
And is averaging 279 miles...

1145
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,467
Now he's pushing
Benson hard!

1146
00:55:31,534 --> 00:55:32,801
7 is riding
Right over 12!

1147
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:34,267
Now he's nosing down
For speed!

1148
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:35,801
Here they come
Down the stretch!

1149
00:55:35,868 --> 00:55:37,300
Lane's pulling away
From Benson

1150
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,701
And going into an angled push.
There he goes!

1151
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:43,334
Lane comes over the grandstand
And pulls out into the lead.

1152
00:55:45,868 --> 00:55:47,801
Uh-oh. There's something
Wrong up there.

1153
00:55:47,868 --> 00:55:49,133
Lane's on fire!

1154
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,267
The grant mystery special
Is on fire,

1155
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:53,234
With the motor
Of the grant racer burning up!

1156
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,300
Lane has the ship
Under perfect control...

1157
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:58,501
Come down, Jim.
Come on, don't be a fool.

1158
00:56:04,467 --> 00:56:05,601
Oh, gunner.

1159
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:07,801
What's-
Why, he's going to continue!

1160
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,300
With only 15
More miles to go,

1161
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,434
Lane's going to gamble that
His ship will hold together!

1162
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:13,767
One more lap.

1163
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:15,100
He's on fire!

1164
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,934
Ah, don't be crazy.
That's nothing.

1165
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,234
It's nice to have
A little fire.

1166
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,267
You don't know how cold
It gets up there.

1167
00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:23,767
Jim! Jim!

1168
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:25,934
Besides, the guy
Is made of asbestos.

1169
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,467
How can you talk like
That? How dare you!

1170
00:56:28,534 --> 00:56:31,000
Why, you little fool,
Who are you talking to?

1171
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:33,968
What do you think this game is,
Anyway? It's death every time you move.

1172
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:36,033
It ain't safe to sit
In one of them!

1173
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,667
It ain't even safe
To look at one of them!

1174
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:41,667
And you married him without giving it
A thought. I'll say you're a sucker.

1175
00:56:41,734 --> 00:56:45,033
Let me tell you another thing! If you're
With that guy long enough, you'll...

1176
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:57,434
Bless you, gunner.

1177
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:00,567
He's got
A good chance.

1178
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:02,133
It's awful good
Up there.

1179
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,734
There he goes,
Diving into the pylon!

1180
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:06,200
And look! Look!
The fire's out!

1181
00:57:06,267 --> 00:57:07,567
He dove the fire out!

1182
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:10,534
Come on, Jim!
Come on, boy!

1183
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:17,634
Here he comes-
The winner!

1184
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:19,400
He's across the line.
Ladies and gentlemen...

1185
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:24,167
Oh!

1186
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:26,534
The grant mystery racer
Wins the thompson trophy race.

1187
00:57:26,601 --> 00:57:29,767
Here he comes in now.
Give him a big hand...

1188
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,267
Why, it's a beauty!

1189
00:57:36,334 --> 00:57:38,300
What were you doing,
Giving us an exhibition?

1190
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:41,801
Ha ha! Thursday!
Thursday! Sweet thursday!

1191
00:57:41,868 --> 00:57:43,300
Aah!

1192
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:44,767
Jim! Jim, that was
Marvelous!

1193
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:46,300
You made it!
Ha ha!

1194
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:48,234
Hey, hey, hey!

1195
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,901
Oh, Benson's in trouble
- Benson in number 12!

1196
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,334
It looks like he's going to
Crash! Everybody off the field!

1197
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,934
Field guards,
To your stations immediately!

1198
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:14,868
Ladies and gentlemen,
Please stay behind the fence

1199
00:58:14,934 --> 00:58:16,100
And off the field.

1200
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:17,601
There's nothing you
Can do there

1201
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:20,000
Save hinder those who are trying
Their best to help Fred Benson.

1202
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:26,701
How is he?

1203
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:28,234
He's all right now.

1204
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,701
Let me through.

1205
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:30,701
I can't.

1206
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:33,200
Please. I'm Mrs. Benson.
It's him.

1207
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:35,100
Will you
Watch the-

1208
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:38,100
Joe, you and kathleen,
You watch the baby.

1209
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:39,601
Now, don't move,
Please.

1210
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:40,801
Mother!

1211
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,968
Mama! Mama!

1212
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:09,634
Wait for me.

1213
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,234
She in there?

1214
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,734
Taking him home
On the midnight.

1215
00:59:18,801 --> 00:59:20,234
She alone?

1216
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,767
Children
Are in the hotel.

1217
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:27,000
Well, that's
The way it goes.

1218
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,834
Oh, Jim.

1219
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:30,634
Yeah?

1220
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:34,167
Benson should never have
Been in that new racer.

1221
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:37,167
There's only one man
In all the country

1222
00:59:37,234 --> 00:59:40,167
Should have been up
With her today, Jim.

1223
00:59:40,234 --> 00:59:43,667
After this, let's you and
I stop this quarreling.

1224
00:59:43,734 --> 00:59:45,667
Seems kind of silly.

1225
00:59:45,734 --> 00:59:47,701
Yeah.

1226
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,868
Go ahead.

1227
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:02,367
I want to see
Mrs. Benson.

1228
01:00:02,434 --> 01:00:03,901
Yes, sir.

1229
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,033
Oh.

1230
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,534
Congratulations,
Mr. Lane.

1231
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:16,701
It was very brave.

1232
01:00:18,434 --> 01:00:21,901
I don't feel the way
I thought I would.

1233
01:00:21,968 --> 01:00:25,834
I guess I was so sure
It would happen sometime.

1234
01:00:25,901 --> 01:00:28,000
How's the dough
Situation?

1235
01:00:28,067 --> 01:00:31,467
Oh, we'll be all right.

1236
01:00:32,634 --> 01:00:34,467
You're lucky in one way, Mrs. Benson.

1237
01:00:34,534 --> 01:00:36,000
I mean,
Lucky that I won.

1238
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:38,000
You see, Benson
And I were splitting

1239
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,501
If either of us
Came through,

1240
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,634
But I suppose
He told you.

1241
01:00:41,701 --> 01:00:42,567
You what?

1242
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:45,534
Yeah. Didn't he
Tell you?

1243
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:46,467
No.

1244
01:00:46,534 --> 01:00:49,601
Well, we were,
So I got it cashed.

1245
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:51,167
There's 5 grand
In the envelope.

1246
01:00:51,234 --> 01:00:52,167
Mr. Lane, please-

1247
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:53,834
You don't me
To welsh on a guy

1248
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,501
Because he's not here
To collect it, do you?

1249
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:56,534
But I-

1250
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,200
But listen, keep it
Under your hat, see?

1251
01:00:58,267 --> 01:01:00,200
I don't want Drake
To know that I thought

1252
01:01:00,267 --> 01:01:02,200
He ever had
A chance to win.

1253
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:04,167
You know how it is.
We don't get on.

1254
01:01:04,234 --> 01:01:07,133
Mr. Lane,
You're lying to me.

1255
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,167
If you want
To put it that way-

1256
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:12,033
Of course, it's
So beautiful of you.

1257
01:01:13,434 --> 01:01:17,100
I- I do need it
So terribly.

1258
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:20,934
I mean, the children.
I mean, they're so-

1259
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,200
It's all right, pal.

1260
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:28,133
And listen, he died
At his trade, see?

1261
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,667
He has to die
Sometime, hasn't he?

1262
01:01:30,734 --> 01:01:34,734
He died in the air, and the
Air is Benson's business.

1263
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:39,133
Yes. Yes, I know.

1264
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,767
And he-he was so dear.

1265
01:01:42,834 --> 01:01:47,801
He wanted to take us
All to italy so much.

1266
01:01:47,868 --> 01:01:50,534
I- I hope he's there.

1267
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:54,167
Ohh!

1268
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,501
Oh, god!

1269
01:02:01,033 --> 01:02:06,868
If I had
The wings of an angel

1270
01:02:06,934 --> 01:02:14,400
O'er these prison walls
I would fly

1271
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:21,701
And fly to the arms
Of my darling

1272
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:29,601
And there
I'd be willing to die

1273
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,634
Come on. Come on. Where is it?

1274
01:02:31,701 --> 01:02:33,634
I'm right here, pal.
I'm right here.

1275
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:35,667
Come on. The dough. The dough.

1276
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:37,601
Never mind the dough.
Waiter!

1277
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:38,834
Listen, ann,
That guy started

1278
01:02:38,901 --> 01:02:40,000
With 10 grand,
All in cash,

1279
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:41,167
And he's
On a bender.

1280
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:42,601
Grab some of it,
Will you?

1281
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,601
I can't grab any.
It's too big.

1282
01:02:44,667 --> 01:02:46,033
Attract
His attention.

1283
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,501
Gentlemen,
Your pleasure.

1284
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:48,534
Hi, dear!

1285
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:51,000
What kind of a drink
Is that-"hi, dear"?

1286
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,534
Oh, that's
A great drink.

1287
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:56,534
"hi, dear"
Is a kansas drink.

1288
01:02:56,601 --> 01:02:58,000
It originated
In wichita.

1289
01:02:58,067 --> 01:03:02,000
Oh! Well, then "hi,
Dear" is the best drink.

1290
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,501
Here.
Have a clean one.

1291
01:03:10,534 --> 01:03:12,701
Well, well! Great day,
Mr. Drake. Great day.

1292
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:14,200
The best race by far.

1293
01:03:14,267 --> 01:03:16,200
Not for me it wasn't, Mr. Brown.

1294
01:03:16,267 --> 01:03:19,200
There's Lane and the boys.
I'm going to speak to them.

1295
01:03:19,267 --> 01:03:21,200
I wouldn't bother. They're pretty drunk.

1296
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:22,701
Let them alone.

1297
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,801
Glad to do it, Mr. Drake.
Glad to do it.

1298
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:29,934
Boys! Boys! Boys!

1299
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,968
Boys! Boys! Let me
Introduce myself.

1300
01:03:33,033 --> 01:03:34,467
We know you!

1301
01:03:34,534 --> 01:03:35,968
He's the chamber
Of commerce!

1302
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:37,467
He's the mayor!

1303
01:03:37,534 --> 01:03:39,467
No, boys, no,
I'm not the mayor,

1304
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:42,501
But all the champagne
You can drink is on me.

1305
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:44,467
Waiter! Waiter!
Champagne for the boys!

1306
01:03:46,234 --> 01:03:47,834
He's
Mr. Cleveland!

1307
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:51,934
No, no, but I know what these
Races mean to this fair city.

1308
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,467
Fair cleveland.

1309
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,834
Boys, boys!

1310
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:02,667
I'm interrupting
This festive gathering

1311
01:04:02,734 --> 01:04:06,501
For two reasons, which
Consists of two toasts.

1312
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:09,367
The first, to Jim Lane,
Who won today,

1313
01:04:09,434 --> 01:04:12,000
The greatest race
In aviation history.

1314
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:13,601
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

1315
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:16,133
How does it feel to be the star? Gosh!

1316
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,133
I'll pin it
On you, baby.

1317
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,634
The second toast, to the man who
Sacrificed his life in the same race,

1318
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:25,734
Your buddy Fred Benson!

1319
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:30,133
Who's Benson?

1320
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,634
Never heard
Of him.

1321
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,934
Get going.

1322
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,267
Come on. Scram!

1323
01:04:34,334 --> 01:04:36,667
Get out of here!
Come on!

1324
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,634
Who is Benson?

1325
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:42,634
Any of you guys
Ever hear of him?

1326
01:04:42,701 --> 01:04:45,634
Yeah. Sure, sure. He's
The guy that went to italy.

1327
01:04:45,701 --> 01:04:48,667
What license
Did that guy ever have to fly?

1328
01:04:48,734 --> 01:04:50,667
He didn't have any.
It's too tough, baby.

1329
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:52,133
The sky looks sweet
And wears

1330
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,167
A pretty blue dress,
Doesn't she? Yeah.

1331
01:04:54,234 --> 01:04:55,834
Don't kid yourself.
She lives up there.

1332
01:04:55,901 --> 01:04:57,267
She invites you
Up there,

1333
01:04:57,334 --> 01:04:59,000
And when she gets you
Up there,

1334
01:04:59,067 --> 01:05:01,167
She knocks you down.
A nice guy like Benson.

1335
01:05:01,234 --> 01:05:02,767
Don't think, honey.

1336
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,801
I'm not thinking, honey.
I'm just telling you.

1337
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:06,334
Benson wasn't
Good enough for her.

1338
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,334
"come on. Get out of the
Sky. I don't like you."

1339
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,667
Sure. That's her. But
Don't let her fool you

1340
01:05:11,734 --> 01:05:13,167
When she looks
Soft and sweet.

1341
01:05:13,234 --> 01:05:15,501
She sits in your lap
And purrs, doesn't she?

1342
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:18,834
Yeah. She don't fool me none,
Because wham! And there it is.

1343
01:05:18,901 --> 01:05:20,234
Fire is still fire.

1344
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,667
Stuck her little tongue
Out at me, didn't she?

1345
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:24,834
All fiery red,
A kiss from cinderella.

1346
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:26,968
She didn't get away
With it, did she?

1347
01:05:27,033 --> 01:05:28,934
Did she, kansas?
She got kissed right back.

1348
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,934
Yeah, and when you take her by
The throat, you shake her silly,

1349
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,467
You slap her back, you put her in
Her place, and you give her the left.

1350
01:05:35,534 --> 01:05:36,968
That vicious,
Scheming, rotten-

1351
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,100
Darling-

1352
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,634
Waiter! Waiter! Waiter!

1353
01:05:40,701 --> 01:05:42,133
Hey, what are you doing?

1354
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,133
I'm trying to get
Some of that dough.

1355
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,634
Is that any way to get
It? Gentlemen don't grab.

1356
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:48,634
If you're going to grab,
Grab a waiter.

1357
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:50,133
Waiter! Waiter! Waiter!

1358
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,634
Look, Jim,
You know you-

1359
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:54,334
I'll know you when you
Come back with a bottle.

1360
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:01,367
Who are you?

1361
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:03,334
A girl.

1362
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,834
Yeah?
Who told you so?

1363
01:06:05,901 --> 01:06:07,834
You did.

1364
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:10,834
I don't even know
Your name.

1365
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:12,834
I know yours.

1366
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:14,801
I'm a famous guy.

1367
01:06:14,868 --> 01:06:16,334
Yeah.

1368
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,300
I want
A blue dress.

1369
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:19,834
Blue?

1370
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:22,334
She wears a blue dress up there.

1371
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,801
Who does?

1372
01:06:23,868 --> 01:06:26,734
Miss "up there."

1373
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:29,267
I look nice
In blue.

1374
01:06:29,334 --> 01:06:31,801
What do I get
For it?

1375
01:06:31,868 --> 01:06:34,300
I'll purr
In your lap.

1376
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,801
You wore
A red dress once.

1377
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,267
I've switched.

1378
01:06:38,334 --> 01:06:40,000
You've what?

1379
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,100
What are you
Doing here anyway?

1380
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:45,467
What do you want?
Waiter! Waiter!

1381
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,300
Gunner, will you
Take me home?

1382
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:48,267
You sick?

1383
01:06:48,334 --> 01:06:49,601
No. I'm just
Tired.

1384
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:50,968
What's the matter?

1385
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:53,467
Come on now, Jim. It's time
For all of us to go home.

1386
01:06:53,534 --> 01:06:55,467
All right. You go right along.
I'll be right along after.

1387
01:06:55,534 --> 01:06:56,934
Thanks for the party,
Darling.

1388
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,801
Going to be a lot
Of them, honey.

1389
01:06:58,868 --> 01:07:00,634
Take her along home,
Gunner. She's tired.

1390
01:07:00,701 --> 01:07:02,000
Where'll you be?

1391
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:03,300
I'll be right here.

1392
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:04,834
Got any money
For a cab?

1393
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,334
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

1394
01:07:10,734 --> 01:07:12,167
Here. Here.
Take it all.

1395
01:07:12,234 --> 01:07:14,834
Thanks. Won't leave you short, will it?

1396
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,467
Well, I met her,
Didn't I?

1397
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:21,000
Who?

1398
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:22,501
My rival.

1399
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:24,501
Sure, sure, you met her.

1400
01:07:24,567 --> 01:07:26,934
Don't just "sure" me
Like that, gunner.

1401
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,434
I tell you,
I met my rival,

1402
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:33,434
And she rides with him
When he's alone up there.

1403
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:35,467
Oh.

1404
01:07:35,534 --> 01:07:37,467
Yeah.

1405
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:40,133
And it's hard
To cut out a girl

1406
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,300
A man loves
When he's alone.

1407
01:07:42,367 --> 01:07:45,467
He never looked at me the way he looked

1408
01:07:45,534 --> 01:07:49,133
When he said he slapped
Her back in her place.

1409
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:53,801
Yeah.

1410
01:07:53,868 --> 01:07:55,968
I met her,
All right.

1411
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:09,968
Don't worry. I'll stay right with him.

1412
01:08:10,033 --> 01:08:11,167
Gunner?

1413
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:12,334
Hmm?

1414
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,033
Tell him
I want to be slapped.

1415
01:08:19,868 --> 01:08:23,200
Back to the same place,
And I ain't sightseeing.

1416
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:29,200
...in your eyes
So blue

1417
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:35,033
Let me call you
Sweetheart...

1418
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:36,934
Next bar from here.

1419
01:09:05,033 --> 01:09:06,467
Don't shake me.
I'm awake.

1420
01:09:06,534 --> 01:09:08,334
I phoned long enough. You should be.

1421
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,167
Yeah. I heard you
The first time.

1422
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:11,701
Why didn't you
Answer it?

1423
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:14,701
What would I answer it
For? I knew who it was.

1424
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:16,734
Do you know
What day it is?

1425
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:19,701
I know it's day and it
Isn't night. That's enough.

1426
01:09:19,767 --> 01:09:21,901
You know
Where you are?

1427
01:09:21,968 --> 01:09:24,567
I know
I was in detroit.

1428
01:09:24,634 --> 01:09:26,667
Yeah. Now you're
In chicago.

1429
01:09:26,734 --> 01:09:28,167
Chicago?

1430
01:09:28,234 --> 01:09:30,200
Chicago.

1431
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:34,133
Chicago, chicago

1432
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,634
I don't feel
Like doing that.

1433
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:39,868
You've been in every
City but indianapolis.

1434
01:09:43,234 --> 01:09:44,667
Where is she?

1435
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:47,000
Last time I saw her,
She was in cleveland.

1436
01:09:47,067 --> 01:09:48,734
That was 4 days ago.

1437
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,701
Yeah. You don't have
To worry, though.

1438
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:53,367
I talked to her
On the phone,

1439
01:09:53,434 --> 01:09:55,033
And I had just
Enough dough left

1440
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,701
To wire her back
To new york.

1441
01:09:56,767 --> 01:09:57,667
Hmm.

1442
01:09:57,734 --> 01:09:59,200
Yeah, and speaking
Of dough,

1443
01:09:59,267 --> 01:10:03,167
I suppose you got my share
Right here with you, huh?

1444
01:10:03,234 --> 01:10:04,901
Look in my pants.

1445
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:14,534
Even the handkerchief
Is blown.

1446
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:16,367
In the vest.

1447
01:10:16,434 --> 01:10:18,167
There ain't no vest.

1448
01:10:18,234 --> 01:10:19,868
Where is it?

1449
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:21,734
Ask the vest!

1450
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:27,834
Well, pal,
It was a great race.

1451
01:10:27,901 --> 01:10:29,534
I'm glad you won.

1452
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,167
Time to go home,
Isn't it?

1453
01:10:35,234 --> 01:10:37,167
I don't know.
Maybe it is.

1454
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:39,167
Anyway,
It's an idea.

1455
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,167
Yeah.

1456
01:10:41,234 --> 01:10:43,834
And I've got to say
I'm sorry, I suppose.

1457
01:10:43,901 --> 01:10:47,467
And yet if there's any
Fuss, I'm going to be sore.

1458
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:49,167
You know how it is.

1459
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:52,334
No, I don't, but let's
Go home and find out.

1460
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,534
And I hope she still likes
You because she's a good girl.

1461
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:58,868
She'd make a fine
Wife for somebody.

1462
01:11:09,601 --> 01:11:11,200
We're all right
So far.

1463
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,501
Asleep.

1464
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:33,701
That's better than having
Them awake. You ought to know.

1465
01:11:37,234 --> 01:11:41,133
I
- I think I'll go in and see how she is.

1466
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,667
Yeah. I think
That'd be fine.

1467
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:46,167
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll go in.

1468
01:11:46,234 --> 01:11:48,000
Yeah. Go right in.

1469
01:11:48,067 --> 01:11:49,801
I'm going.

1470
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:51,534
Yeah.

1471
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,834
What are you
Going to do?

1472
01:11:56,901 --> 01:11:59,834
Stay here, where
I can get out quick.

1473
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:01,334
Wise guy.

1474
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,367
You're the fella that
Always takes the chances.

1475
01:12:04,434 --> 01:12:07,033
You ought to
Know that one.

1476
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:19,667
You want to come
With me?

1477
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:21,334
No. No, thank you.

1478
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:52,501
Oh.

1479
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:54,501
Hello.

1480
01:12:54,567 --> 01:12:56,367
How are you, ann?

1481
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:01,834
I didn't think
I was asleep.

1482
01:13:01,901 --> 01:13:04,834
How are you,
Bad boy?

1483
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:07,334
Pretty bad boy.

1484
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,334
Feeling low?

1485
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,834
I've been up higher.

1486
01:13:11,901 --> 01:13:13,567
Sure.

1487
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:20,033
I'm glad
To see you, ann.

1488
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,000
I'm glad.

1489
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:24,000
Is gunner
Out there?

1490
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:25,968
Yeah.

1491
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:28,634
I'll be out
In a minute.

1492
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:30,300
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1493
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,100
Come on out.

1494
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,634
Nothing to it.

1495
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:37,133
What'd she say?

1496
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,434
Nothing.

1497
01:13:40,534 --> 01:13:41,767
Hello.

1498
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,367
Howdy.

1499
01:13:45,534 --> 01:13:47,501
You're both
Looking fine.

1500
01:13:47,567 --> 01:13:50,501
Well, you know, we've been out before.

1501
01:13:50,567 --> 01:13:51,968
Experience helps.

1502
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:54,467
Say, what have you
Been doing?

1503
01:13:54,534 --> 01:13:59,000
Gee, that's just like him to
Say that like that, isn't it?

1504
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,000
Well, dear, you've had
More fun than I have.

1505
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:05,000
Well, I've tried, if
You put it that way.

1506
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:07,000
And I've tried
For 5 days

1507
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:10,334
To think of some way
To be cross with you.

1508
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,734
Oh, Jim, if I could
Only hate you.

1509
01:14:13,801 --> 01:14:15,334
What do you want to hate me for, baby?

1510
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,868
Gee, that would be fine.

1511
01:14:17,934 --> 01:14:20,400
And don't sit there
And look so, dear.

1512
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:22,934
He's looking at me
Like he used to,

1513
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,734
Just looking.

1514
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,734
Look at gunner.

1515
01:14:29,467 --> 01:14:31,133
Hey!

1516
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,801
There it is.

1517
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:36,734
You see what I mean,
Gunner? When he just looks?

1518
01:14:38,334 --> 01:14:42,801
That's why I married him,
So it must be some look.

1519
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:46,167
It's so stern and so sweet
And so dumb.

1520
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:49,334
It's halfway between
An indian and a gazelle,

1521
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,367
And I can't do anything
Against it.

1522
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:55,801
Oh, won't the landlady
Be glad to see you, too?

1523
01:14:55,868 --> 01:14:57,334
Hmm?

1524
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,834
How she likes you.

1525
01:14:58,901 --> 01:15:00,334
She likes me?

1526
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,467
Does she.
She kept asking me,

1527
01:15:02,534 --> 01:15:05,667
"when in the world
Will Mr. Lane be home?"

1528
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,167
She's
A fine woman.

1529
01:15:07,234 --> 01:15:10,167
Say, how much do we owe her, darling?

1530
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:11,667
About $200, darling.

1531
01:15:11,734 --> 01:15:14,167
Oh, well, that's nothing, is it?

1532
01:15:14,234 --> 01:15:19,634
No, but I'll bet you haven't got
All of that 10,000 left, have you?

1533
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:22,234
I'll bet-let's see.
5 days...

1534
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,267
Gee whiz,
The way you spend it,

1535
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:27,801
I'll bet you haven't
Got over-

1536
01:15:27,868 --> 01:15:31,100
Over 6,000 or 7,000 left,
Have you?

1537
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,367
Not over that,
Dear.

1538
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:37,701
Well, it's a lot more
Than $10, isn't it?

1539
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:40,501
Remember the night
We only had $10, darling?

1540
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:42,033
Boy!

1541
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:45,367
Uh, gunner tells me
You got home all right.

1542
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:47,868
Yes. Here I am.
I'm home.

1543
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:50,901
Yeah.
That's right.

1544
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:53,400
Kind of a lonesome trip, though...

1545
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:55,167
Probably.

1546
01:15:57,067 --> 01:15:58,934
Better than
Mrs. Benson's.

1547
01:16:02,734 --> 01:16:04,234
Yeah.

1548
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:10,467
I'm sorry, ann.
I'm broke.

1549
01:16:10,534 --> 01:16:13,334
I'm asking for your
Hand. I want to shake it.

1550
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,501
I know you're broke.
I was only teasing.

1551
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:17,501
But I know Mrs. Benson
Isn't broke.

1552
01:16:17,567 --> 01:16:19,501
That was lovely
Of you, pal.

1553
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:22,868
I'll bet you were funny when
You were giving it to her.

1554
01:16:22,934 --> 01:16:25,801
I wish I'd been
Behind the screen.

1555
01:16:25,868 --> 01:16:27,300
Hey!

1556
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:28,300
What?

1557
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:29,834
You're some girl!

1558
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:30,801
Oh!

1559
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:32,334
I see. I see now.

1560
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,834
You do? What?

1561
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:35,834
I see what you are.
You're all right.

1562
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:37,834
And listen, you know
What I'm going to do?

1563
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:39,634
I'm going to do something
That'll surprise you.

1564
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:41,834
I'm going to show you
What I think of you.

1565
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:43,834
I'm going out and grab
Some wine and drink to you.

1566
01:16:43,901 --> 01:16:45,334
What a surprise!

1567
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,334
Don't kid yourself. Any dame
That accepts things like that

1568
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,300
Isn't a dame.
She's something else.

1569
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:52,334
Is that joint open on the corner?
Never mind. I'll break in if it isn't.

1570
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,701
I'll be back with the bacon.
I'm drinking to a woman.

1571
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:57,634
I'm drinking to your mother,
I'm drinking to your father,

1572
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:00,400
And I'm drinking to the whole
Cornfed state of kansas.

1573
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:06,501
I've been around him
A long time.

1574
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:10,000
That's the first time I ever heard
Him praise anything but himself.

1575
01:17:10,067 --> 01:17:11,501
I can't believe it.

1576
01:17:11,567 --> 01:17:14,501
But you've got it coming.
It was fine.

1577
01:17:14,567 --> 01:17:19,000
Why? What else do you do
When there's nothing to do?

1578
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:22,167
It's easy to be gallant
When you're doomed.

1579
01:17:23,567 --> 01:17:25,634
What do you mean,
Doomed?

1580
01:17:26,834 --> 01:17:28,267
You should
Ask me that.

1581
01:17:28,334 --> 01:17:31,033
Who said I was a sucker
When he was on fire?

1582
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,033
I've had 5 days
To think, haven't I?

1583
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,200
Don't you think I know
He has to get drunk?

1584
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:37,400
Don't you think I can think with you?

1585
01:17:37,467 --> 01:17:40,200
And don't you think, Mr.
Gunner, I've tried to walk out?

1586
01:17:40,267 --> 01:17:42,167
I've got a ticket in
My pocketbook, even.

1587
01:17:42,234 --> 01:17:45,868
I've packed my bag so
Many times it's worn out,

1588
01:17:45,934 --> 01:17:47,534
But I didn't go,

1589
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:49,734
And now I'm going
To be drunk to.

1590
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:52,634
But, ann, you shouldn't
Think like that,

1591
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:55,901
Because
- because it's no way to think. It's crazy.

1592
01:17:55,968 --> 01:17:57,367
Well,
This is crazier.

1593
01:17:57,434 --> 01:18:01,300
3 roads face us, and there's
Doom at the end of each.

1594
01:18:01,367 --> 01:18:02,767
Suppose
He didn't drink,

1595
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:04,467
He slapped her
Back again,

1596
01:18:04,534 --> 01:18:07,534
And he sits around, his
Nerves screaming with triumph.

1597
01:18:07,601 --> 01:18:09,033
He sits around

1598
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,167
Drinking sarsaparilla with ann-me.

1599
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:13,033
How he would
Love me.

1600
01:18:14,234 --> 01:18:16,667
The second road
Is worse than that.

1601
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:19,167
He's retired from flying
And works on the ground.

1602
01:18:19,234 --> 01:18:21,634
Imagine a man with
His heart in the sky

1603
01:18:21,701 --> 01:18:24,200
Living with a woman
On the ground.

1604
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:26,501
He wouldn't like
Himself very much,

1605
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:29,334
And I wouldn't like him, either, gunner.

1606
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,133
Oh, no. He's in love
With a woman with wings.

1607
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,067
She's got him. I've
No way to cut her out.

1608
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:38,434
But there's
Another road.

1609
01:18:38,501 --> 01:18:41,234
Yes, there is,
And we're on it.

1610
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,100
We go on as if nothing had happened.

1611
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:46,767
He goes in the next race, another bat,

1612
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:49,567
Another race,
Another bat,

1613
01:18:49,634 --> 01:18:53,167
Until someday, when he's
Not quite so young and quick,

1614
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:55,200
She slaps him out,

1615
01:18:55,267 --> 01:18:59,133
And Mrs. Benson takes
Another man home on the train.

1616
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:02,634
How do you like it?

1617
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:04,200
You know, don't you?

1618
01:19:04,267 --> 01:19:08,167
No, no, I don't know. I've
Only had it for 10 years,

1619
01:19:08,234 --> 01:19:10,868
And you hit it right
On the nose, too.

1620
01:19:10,934 --> 01:19:13,234
You just sit
And wait for it.

1621
01:19:14,434 --> 01:19:16,133
What do I do it for?

1622
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,467
Because there's nothing
Else to do. He gets you.

1623
01:19:19,534 --> 01:19:22,534
There's no fun being
With anybody else.

1624
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:27,501
What's fun about waiting
For somebody to die?

1625
01:19:27,567 --> 01:19:30,167
Every ticktock
Of the clock-

1626
01:19:30,234 --> 01:19:32,501
Still living,
Still living,

1627
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:35,167
Still living,
Still living.

1628
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:37,901
What for?
I won't do it.

1629
01:19:37,968 --> 01:19:40,701
I won't love him
That much.

1630
01:19:40,767 --> 01:19:42,801
What do you think
I'm made of?

1631
01:19:42,868 --> 01:19:45,000
How can you expect
Me to do that?

1632
01:19:45,067 --> 01:19:46,934
You didn't say
I was a sucker.

1633
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,801
You said I was the champion of them.

1634
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,567
Well, I won't be.

1635
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:54,868
Haven't I the right
To live my life

1636
01:19:54,934 --> 01:19:56,868
Without being tortured every second?

1637
01:19:56,934 --> 01:19:58,400
Haven't I?

1638
01:19:58,467 --> 01:20:00,234
Haven't I?!

1639
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:08,701
What's the matter?

1640
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:11,033
I'm leaving you, that's what
It is, on the next train.

1641
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,534
You'll never
See me again.

1642
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:14,000
Don't blow on me, ann.
Right now.

1643
01:20:14,067 --> 01:20:16,634
Give me a chance to make
Up for this, will you? No.

1644
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:19,200
Come on. Give me a chance. I'm
Not used to being married yet.

1645
01:20:19,267 --> 01:20:20,234
No.

1646
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,701
But I'll pick up.
I never asked anybody

1647
01:20:21,767 --> 01:20:23,234
To do anything
For me before.

1648
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,701
That's a good start,
Isn't it, ann?

1649
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:26,200
I won't do it.

1650
01:20:26,267 --> 01:20:29,167
I've been looking forward to
Seeing you all day. Ask the gunner.

1651
01:20:29,234 --> 01:20:30,667
I don't care.

1652
01:20:30,734 --> 01:20:33,667
And listen, dear, I'm going to
Prove a lot of things to you.

1653
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:35,667
We started on that
Last party together.

1654
01:20:35,734 --> 01:20:37,801
I can see your face
Before me right now,

1655
01:20:37,868 --> 01:20:39,801
Sitting there
Through all that smoke.

1656
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,834
We were even flirting,
Weren't we? Sure we were.

1657
01:20:41,901 --> 01:20:43,868
That party is going to
End up with you.

1658
01:20:43,934 --> 01:20:45,868
You go in the kitchen
And make some sandwiches,

1659
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:48,667
And we'll make believe there
Were no 5 days in between.

1660
01:20:48,734 --> 01:20:50,701
Just you and I
On a little blowoff.

1661
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:52,400
See the idea of it, ann?

1662
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:53,901
Please see.

1663
01:20:53,968 --> 01:20:55,634
No.

1664
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:01,634
Take it easy, pal.

1665
01:21:06,434 --> 01:21:08,901
It's all right. You
Can't blame her, I guess.

1666
01:21:08,968 --> 01:21:10,901
All that talk of sweden
And all that.

1667
01:21:10,968 --> 01:21:12,901
You know those things
Are disappointing.

1668
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:15,400
And she tried hard
To forgive me, didn't she?

1669
01:21:15,467 --> 01:21:17,901
I wish she hadn't made me
Believe it, though.

1670
01:21:17,968 --> 01:21:21,400
She was kind of sweet the
Way she talked at first.

1671
01:21:21,467 --> 01:21:22,901
Well, that's all right.

1672
01:21:22,968 --> 01:21:24,901
A lot of angles
To it, boy.

1673
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:26,834
Yeah? There's just
One angle to it, boy-

1674
01:21:26,901 --> 01:21:29,868
She doesn't love me as much
As I thought she did.

1675
01:21:29,934 --> 01:21:32,234
That's the ticket when
You get right down to it,

1676
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,334
And there's nothing
You can do about that.

1677
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,367
Yeah, and that's
All right, too.

1678
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:37,868
Oh, I don't know.

1679
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,868
Yeah? Well,
She fooled me good.

1680
01:21:39,934 --> 01:21:42,868
I thought I rated higher
Than a few days drunk.

1681
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,000
I'm sorry I asked her
To stay now,

1682
01:21:47,067 --> 01:21:50,000
Because I did ask her. You
Were in the room. You heard me.

1683
01:21:50,067 --> 01:21:52,000
I actually asked her
To stay.

1684
01:21:52,067 --> 01:21:54,501
I did something I never
Did before in my life-

1685
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:56,968
I begged a girl
To be my girl. Hmm!

1686
01:21:57,033 --> 01:21:59,801
And I didn't beg her once.
I begged her twice.

1687
01:21:59,868 --> 01:22:02,601
Me! A little country girl
Off of a kansas farm,

1688
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,200
And I begged her.

1689
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:07,467
I ought to go in there
And tell her right now!

1690
01:22:10,767 --> 01:22:12,400
I'm packed.

1691
01:22:12,467 --> 01:22:15,000
See all my things?

1692
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,033
You just happened
To come back

1693
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,534
At the wrong
Moment, dear.

1694
01:22:22,601 --> 01:22:25,534
I was telling gunner how
Lonesome I was, that's all.

1695
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:27,000
After this,
I'll understand.

1696
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:30,467
Your life is yours, and the
Loudest applause you'll hear of all

1697
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:32,434
Will be me in the stands.

1698
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:35,834
So, do you still want me
To come to the party?

1699
01:22:35,901 --> 01:22:38,367
I'll make a cheese sandwich if you do.

1700
01:22:38,434 --> 01:22:40,334
I do that very well.

1701
01:22:42,067 --> 01:22:44,234
Gee, I'm glad
To see you, crazy.

1702
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,601
Did you really see my
Face through the smoke?

1703
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:51,601
How's your sky girl? Have you
Slapped her since I've seen you?

1704
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:53,100
Yes, dear.

1705
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:56,567
I know you don't want me
To get out of here now.

1706
01:22:56,634 --> 01:22:57,968
There's that funny look coming over

1707
01:22:58,033 --> 01:22:59,534
Your funny mug
Again.

1708
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:01,033
See it, gunner?

1709
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:04,567
I don't see why that's
Funnier than any other.

1710
01:23:04,634 --> 01:23:07,267
See? Gunner thinks
You're funny, too.

1711
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,534
You're a big clown,
Baby.

1712
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:14,567
No other face ever made me
Laugh so much before.

1713
01:23:14,634 --> 01:23:17,567
And she calls me crazy. I ask you.

1714
01:23:17,634 --> 01:23:20,434
Listen, nuts, I'm going to
Do more than look at you.

1715
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:22,067
I'm going to
Settle down.

1716
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:25,033
Yeah. I'm going to surprise
You. I'm going to settle down.

1717
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,667
How, dear?
Settle how?

1718
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:28,167
Just the way you want it. Jim.

1719
01:23:28,234 --> 01:23:29,834
I'm going to get
That dough back

1720
01:23:29,901 --> 01:23:31,667
So fast you won't know
What hit you.

1721
01:23:31,734 --> 01:23:33,701
Drake's got jobs that
No one wants any part of,

1722
01:23:33,767 --> 01:23:35,367
All the way from pursuit
Jobs to seaplanes.

1723
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:38,367
That-a boy. That's a cute
Little place to settle down.

1724
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:39,634
What do you
Mean, pal?

1725
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:41,334
I mean, right in the middle
Of the atlantic ocean.

1726
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,868
Oh. Say, who do you love, kansas?

1727
01:23:43,934 --> 01:23:46,334
You, so help me, the whole ocean full.

1728
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,868
I'm so crazy
About you.

1729
01:23:47,934 --> 01:23:49,868
Yes. I'm nuts.
I must be.

1730
01:23:49,934 --> 01:23:51,534
Ha ha ha!

1731
01:23:52,734 --> 01:23:54,100
I wish you could have
Seen Drake's face

1732
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:55,567
When I told him I was settling
Down. He thought I was drunk.

1733
01:23:55,634 --> 01:23:57,100
You're not fooling
Anybody.

1734
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:59,601
Wrap it tight, pal. I'm going to
Give it the works up there today,

1735
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,033
And I don't want it
To pop open.

1736
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:02,601
I'll wrap them.
You fly them.

1737
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:05,601
What's eating on you? You think
I'm going to get drunk tonight, too?

1738
01:24:05,667 --> 01:24:06,601
You think so?

1739
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:07,601
I didn't say that.

1740
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:09,100
No. You didn't say
Anything.

1741
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:11,100
Listen, I meant every word
I told her last night.

1742
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:12,601
From now on, I'm going to
Attend to business.

1743
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:14,601
I used to take jobs
When I felt like it,

1744
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:16,934
But from now on, I'm going to
Take anything that comes along,

1745
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,634
And all the dough
- I'm going to put it right in her lap.

1746
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:21,133
Will that
Please her! Baby!

1747
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,634
Do you really want
To please her?

1748
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:23,634
Just watch me.

1749
01:24:23,701 --> 01:24:25,567
Quit flying and go
Into a shoe store.

1750
01:24:25,634 --> 01:24:26,801
Did she tell you that?

1751
01:24:26,868 --> 01:24:28,033
I'm just
Saying that.

1752
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:30,067
Yeah, and you're just
Saying nothing, as usual.

1753
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:32,067
That just shows you
What you know about women.

1754
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,567
A shoe store! I should give up
The trade I love for a woman.

1755
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:36,434
She'd hate me.
You heard what she said-

1756
01:24:36,501 --> 01:24:38,567
She'd be the loudest
Applause of all.

1757
01:24:38,634 --> 01:24:40,534
Why don't you go
Drown yourself?

1758
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:41,939
Is that
Tight enough?

1759
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,067
Yeah, but I'm not
Going to be tonight.

1760
01:24:44,133 --> 01:24:46,067
I'm going to take her
To a show instead.

1761
01:24:46,133 --> 01:24:47,534
And who do you love,
Honey?

1762
01:24:47,601 --> 01:24:49,100
I love you.

1763
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,601
Yeah,
And I love you, too.

1764
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:52,100
Come on.
Cut it out!

1765
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:53,601
Sweetheart,
You didn't kiss me.

1766
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:55,100
Come on. Let's go
And kiss the army.

1767
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:56,367
Yeah. All right.

1768
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:06,434
Well! He's
Getting even

1769
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:07,968
To look like
A gentleman,

1770
01:25:08,033 --> 01:25:09,434
Isn't he,
Gunner?

1771
01:25:09,501 --> 01:25:11,467
He's got that settled-down look.

1772
01:25:11,534 --> 01:25:12,934
Do you play
Bridge, Jim?

1773
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,467
It's an idea.
I'll learn.

1774
01:25:14,534 --> 01:25:16,934
Ah, come to the house any evening.

1775
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:17,934
Glad to.

1776
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,467
Will you come
To dinner?

1777
01:25:19,534 --> 01:25:20,467
Fine.

1778
01:25:20,534 --> 01:25:21,968
White tie?

1779
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:23,000
Right.

1780
01:25:23,067 --> 01:25:24,667
White tie!

1781
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:29,667
Ah, general!

1782
01:25:29,734 --> 01:25:32,667
Well, you knew I'd make it somehow, huh?

1783
01:25:32,734 --> 01:25:34,667
Well, I had the idea.

1784
01:25:34,734 --> 01:25:36,667
Well, well, well,
Well, well!

1785
01:25:36,734 --> 01:25:38,167
Hello, general.

1786
01:25:38,234 --> 01:25:40,133
I haven't seen you
Since you left the army.

1787
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,133
How are they doing?

1788
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,267
I might forget
A lot of things

1789
01:25:42,334 --> 01:25:43,467
If you want
To come back.

1790
01:25:43,534 --> 01:25:44,634
I've still got
Insomnia.

1791
01:25:44,701 --> 01:25:45,634
Ha ha ha!

1792
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:47,133
Oh, Lane.
Yeah?

1793
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,133
Drake has probably told
You everything but this-

1794
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,634
This test is more important to
The army than it is to Drake.

1795
01:25:52,701 --> 01:25:56,634
Drake will sell a lot of ships
If you win. That lets him out.

1796
01:25:56,701 --> 01:26:00,167
But the army needs a new pursuit
Speed. We've got to have it.

1797
01:26:00,234 --> 01:26:01,667
Who are you chasing,
General?

1798
01:26:01,734 --> 01:26:03,133
Wait'll you see
What we've got.

1799
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,167
It's a shame to bust up
A pretty bird like this,

1800
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:06,667
But you've got to
Do it for us.

1801
01:26:06,734 --> 01:26:08,167
We must find out
What that speed is.

1802
01:26:08,234 --> 01:26:09,667
She'll move,
General.

1803
01:26:09,734 --> 01:26:13,167
I hope so. I saw billy hogan
Bringing the other one down.

1804
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:14,740
She wasn't loafing,
Either,

1805
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:16,573
But hogan wasn't alive
To tell us.

1806
01:26:16,574 --> 01:26:18,667
I shouldn't be telling
You this, I suppose.

1807
01:26:18,734 --> 01:26:20,701
Why general, you're giving me
The jitters.

1808
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:22,834
What do you expect of
Those army aviators?

1809
01:26:22,901 --> 01:26:25,501
Anyway, I'll kiss the
Wings good-bye at 3,000

1810
01:26:25,567 --> 01:26:28,100
And have all the dough
For you, ok, general?

1811
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:29,634
Come out alive, boy.

1812
01:26:29,701 --> 01:26:31,801
Yeah. Sure.
You should see her.

1813
01:27:02,267 --> 01:27:03,367
Thank you.

1814
01:27:26,501 --> 01:27:29,234
Thought you were
Going to stay home.

1815
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,100
That's worse.
I'd rather see it, even.

1816
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:34,067
Do they go that high
Always?

1817
01:27:34,133 --> 01:27:37,801
That's the idea of it.
They got to get a start.

1818
01:27:39,534 --> 01:27:42,968
How bad is it?
As bad as I gathered?

1819
01:27:43,033 --> 01:27:44,968
Remember,
We don't act.

1820
01:27:45,033 --> 01:27:46,934
I don't know, ann.

1821
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,667
That's right.
Don't kid me.

1822
01:28:02,734 --> 01:28:05,267
Here he comes!

1823
01:28:05,334 --> 01:28:09,100
I wish he were home. No, I
Don't, either. Come on, Jim!

1824
01:29:17,801 --> 01:29:20,734
Wouldn't it be funny
If it rained?

1825
01:29:20,801 --> 01:29:23,701
If it rained now,
We'd all get wet,

1826
01:29:23,767 --> 01:29:26,334
And he's got
An umbrella.

1827
01:29:42,901 --> 01:29:43,834
Thanks.

1828
01:29:43,901 --> 01:29:45,167
You ok?

1829
01:29:45,234 --> 01:29:47,334
Yes, yes.
Go on home.

1830
01:29:49,434 --> 01:29:51,200
You all right, Jim?

1831
01:29:51,267 --> 01:29:53,167
Yeah, sure.

1832
01:29:53,234 --> 01:29:55,200
Ok, read it
Yourself.

1833
01:29:55,267 --> 01:29:56,701
9.6.

1834
01:29:56,767 --> 01:30:00,033
Yeah. Wait till you see the
Whites of their eyes, gentlemen.

1835
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,701
Ha ha ha!

1836
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,667
Come on. Take
A little more.

1837
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:06,167
Good. That's fine.

1838
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,667
He's all right.

1839
01:30:07,734 --> 01:30:09,200
You mean it?

1840
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:10,367
Yeah, yeah.

1841
01:30:10,434 --> 01:30:11,868
Don't tell him.

1842
01:30:11,934 --> 01:30:13,334
I won't, pal.

1843
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,367
Thanks.

1844
01:30:14,434 --> 01:30:15,667
I'll go find him.

1845
01:30:15,734 --> 01:30:17,200
All right, pal.

1846
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:22,367
Well, well! What are you doing here?

1847
01:30:22,434 --> 01:30:24,067
I was a little
Thirsty, wasn't I?

1848
01:30:24,133 --> 01:30:25,734
You should have
Seen her, Mr. Lane.

1849
01:30:25,801 --> 01:30:27,667
He's seen me before. How
About joining me, Mr. Lane?

1850
01:30:27,734 --> 01:30:29,667
Don't tell me you're buying
A drink, Mrs. Lane. Scotch.

1851
01:30:29,734 --> 01:30:31,334
What do you do
For dough?

1852
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,167
Twice. My credit
Is far-reaching.

1853
01:30:33,234 --> 01:30:35,868
Yeah? Then how about
Reaching for that, pal?

1854
01:30:36,901 --> 01:30:37,968
Ooh. $4,000.

1855
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:39,133
How's that?

1856
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,300
Oh, well.

1857
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,000
Well, look again.
It isn't mine.

1858
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:43,501
It's made out to me.

1859
01:30:43,567 --> 01:30:45,501
Yeah, and there's a lot more
Coming in that same parade.

1860
01:30:45,567 --> 01:30:47,467
Didn't I tell you things
Were going to be different?

1861
01:30:47,534 --> 01:30:49,334
And you know what I'm
Going to do tonight?

1862
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,000
I'm going to take
You to a show,

1863
01:30:51,067 --> 01:30:52,634
And then I'm going
Home like a gentleman-

1864
01:30:52,701 --> 01:30:54,501
I mean, like a husband. What do I mean?

1865
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:56,167
The whole idea's
Got me groggy.

1866
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:58,701
Me, too, but I'm not going to
Be any more groggier about you.

1867
01:30:58,767 --> 01:31:00,534
I don't care
How sweet you are.huh?

1868
01:31:00,601 --> 01:31:02,534
I'm stuck on you enough,
And that's enough, see?

1869
01:31:02,601 --> 01:31:04,033
Stuck on me, huh?

1870
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,701
Yes, I'm stuck on you. And
Now I'm going to drink to you.

1871
01:31:06,767 --> 01:31:08,667
Here's to your mother,
Here's to your father,

1872
01:31:08,734 --> 01:31:12,033
And here's to the best aviator
In the entire cockeyed world.

1873
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,734
Ha ha ha!

1874
01:31:53,234 --> 01:31:56,167
Still living...
Still living... Still living...

1875
01:31:56,234 --> 01:31:58,133
Still living...
Still living.

1876
01:32:15,767 --> 01:32:19,200
I hope you all know
Who you're riding with!

1877
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,701
Woo! Ha ha!

1878
01:32:21,767 --> 01:32:23,834
I'm not kidding!

1879
01:32:25,767 --> 01:32:28,634
I want you to meet
The greatest test pilot

1880
01:32:28,701 --> 01:32:30,934
In the history
Of the world!

1881
01:32:32,534 --> 01:32:34,634
Trouble, brother?
You look mournful.

1882
01:32:34,701 --> 01:32:37,167
Afraid your friends
Will fall out?

1883
01:32:37,234 --> 01:32:39,467
It's another road
At that.

1884
01:32:39,534 --> 01:32:42,000
No, they won't be
That lucky.

1885
01:32:42,067 --> 01:32:44,000
Oh, look
At this one!

1886
01:32:47,701 --> 01:32:49,167
Ah!

1887
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:53,968
Oh, boy!

1888
01:32:54,033 --> 01:32:55,634
Yes, ma'am?

1889
01:32:55,701 --> 01:32:59,167
Please don't go so fast. Mr. Lane
Has a little trouble with his heart,

1890
01:32:59,234 --> 01:33:02,167
And any speed... Well,
You know what I mean.

1891
01:33:02,234 --> 01:33:04,167
Yes, ma'am. I'll take it nice and slow.

1892
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:05,868
Ha ha ha!

1893
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,901
Oh, it's wonderful
To be silly, I guess.

1894
01:33:13,267 --> 01:33:15,200
Oh, I want
Some peanuts.

1895
01:33:15,267 --> 01:33:16,534
Peanuts? Yeah.

1896
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:18,367
Oh, be careful,
Darling.

1897
01:33:18,434 --> 01:33:19,701
You can't keep
This up.

1898
01:33:19,767 --> 01:33:20,834
What's the matter?

1899
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:22,200
I've never felt
Such pain.

1900
01:33:22,267 --> 01:33:23,701
It's like the sharp edge of a knife.

1901
01:33:23,767 --> 01:33:25,200
I'll get used
To it, really.

1902
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:26,634
You'll be dead
Before he is.

1903
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:27,968
That's
All right, too.

1904
01:33:28,033 --> 01:33:29,300
All right.

1905
01:33:29,367 --> 01:33:32,133
I'm sorry. I'll get used
To it in time. Give me time.

1906
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:35,601
I don't mean that either. I'm grabbing
What I can. What do you want me to do?

1907
01:33:35,667 --> 01:33:37,133
I don't know.

1908
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,100
Gunner, don't
Ever fall in love.

1909
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:40,901
Don't ever
Fall in love.

1910
01:33:40,968 --> 01:33:42,634
You know what goes
Good with peanuts?

1911
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:43,801
What, outside
Of you?

1912
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:44,801
Champagne.

1913
01:33:44,868 --> 01:33:46,334
Yeah? Try
And get it.

1914
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,334
That's easy. There's a good
Hotel right up here-the neptune.

1915
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,501
The neptune?

1916
01:33:49,567 --> 01:33:50,667
The neptune.

1917
01:33:50,734 --> 01:33:52,167
Yes, sir.

1918
01:33:52,234 --> 01:33:53,834
Having a good
Time, darling?

1919
01:33:53,901 --> 01:33:55,000
Precious.

1920
01:33:55,067 --> 01:33:56,501
Enjoying yourself,
Gunner?

1921
01:33:56,567 --> 01:33:57,868
Adorable.

1922
01:33:57,934 --> 01:34:01,167
Why don't you be gay for once
And give yourself a shock?

1923
01:34:01,234 --> 01:34:02,667
Too many roads.

1924
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:03,834
What roads?

1925
01:34:03,901 --> 01:34:04,801
3 roads.

1926
01:34:04,868 --> 01:34:05,801
Gunner-

1927
01:34:05,868 --> 01:34:07,300
Yeah, 3 roads.

1928
01:34:07,367 --> 01:34:08,834
3 roads.
3 roads.

1929
01:34:08,901 --> 01:34:10,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1930
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:11,467
This is driving
Me crazy.

1931
01:34:11,534 --> 01:34:13,167
The 3 roads? Yeah, the 3 roads,

1932
01:34:13,234 --> 01:34:14,834
And I don't know
What I'm doing.

1933
01:34:14,901 --> 01:34:16,033
You're going
Crazy.

1934
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:17,534
Yeah, I guess
Maybe I am.

1935
01:34:19,734 --> 01:34:21,067
Gunner.

1936
01:34:22,601 --> 01:34:24,667
I'm sorry to see you
Do that, pal.

1937
01:34:24,734 --> 01:34:27,133
You're going to be sorry
For a lot more than that,

1938
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,133
But you got company.
There's 3 of us,

1939
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,133
And we're all doomed.
That's a road apiece.

1940
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,133
And miss up there-
She lives on.

1941
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,100
What are you
Talking about?

1942
01:34:35,167 --> 01:34:37,100
You're drunk already.

1943
01:34:37,167 --> 01:34:39,601
I haven't said
A word.

1944
01:34:39,667 --> 01:34:41,467
Here, have a drink.

1945
01:34:45,734 --> 01:34:46,801
Where are we?

1946
01:34:46,868 --> 01:34:48,834
We're going through
Brooklyn, dear.

1947
01:34:50,234 --> 01:34:51,167
Jim.

1948
01:34:51,234 --> 01:34:52,133
What?

1949
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,667
Going through
Brooklyn.

1950
01:34:53,734 --> 01:34:55,634
I can't help it.

1951
01:34:55,701 --> 01:34:57,667
Brooklyn
Or anything else.

1952
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,701
You're helpless.

1953
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:01,968
3 roads.

1954
01:35:02,033 --> 01:35:03,501
He's on them
Again.

1955
01:35:03,567 --> 01:35:04,667
What, dear?

1956
01:35:04,734 --> 01:35:06,167
3 roads.

1957
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:07,667
Oh.

1958
01:35:07,734 --> 01:35:09,334
Make him
Take this.

1959
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,834
I'll take them,

1960
01:35:10,901 --> 01:35:13,133
All 3 of them.

1961
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,167
3 blind roads.

1962
01:35:15,234 --> 01:35:17,167
See how they run.

1963
01:35:17,234 --> 01:35:18,634
Where are we?

1964
01:35:18,701 --> 01:35:20,167
In brooklyn still?

1965
01:35:20,234 --> 01:35:22,133
You're on
The roads, boy.

1966
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,701
It won't be long.

1967
01:35:23,767 --> 01:35:26,634
Ann.

1968
01:35:26,701 --> 01:35:28,100
Oh, ann.

1969
01:35:28,167 --> 01:35:29,634
I'm right here,
Dear.

1970
01:35:29,701 --> 01:35:31,100
Where's Jim?

1971
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:32,634
He's right here,
Too.

1972
01:35:32,701 --> 01:35:34,133
Two? You're crazy.

1973
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,968
There's 3.

1974
01:35:36,033 --> 01:35:38,634
3 roads...

1975
01:35:38,701 --> 01:35:40,501
3 blind roads.

1976
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,801
How much heavier
You figure

1977
01:36:35,868 --> 01:36:37,634
These new bombs are
Going to run, general?

1978
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:39,133
3 or 4 tons.

1979
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,601
That's enough. Have you met Lane's wife?

1980
01:36:41,667 --> 01:36:43,133
No.

1981
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,133
They don't come
Any sweeter.

1982
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,634
Thursday!
Hello!

1983
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:48,100
Oh, hello.

1984
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:50,133
Come over here.

1985
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,634
General ross, this is thursday Lane.

1986
01:36:52,701 --> 01:36:53,801
Hello, thursday.

1987
01:36:53,868 --> 01:36:54,968
Hello, general.

1988
01:36:55,033 --> 01:36:56,434
Get in there.

1989
01:36:56,501 --> 01:36:57,634
Thank you.

1990
01:36:57,701 --> 01:36:59,133
Come here.
Well...

1991
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,100
What's the name
Of the hotel, general?

1992
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:03,601
Isn't she a buster?

1993
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:06,667
This is going to be the
Biggest job Jim's ever done,

1994
01:37:06,734 --> 01:37:08,167
In every way,
Thursday.

1995
01:37:08,234 --> 01:37:10,634
You see all that loading
They're doing?

1996
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:13,667
That represents the weight
Of the bombs and the crew.

1997
01:37:13,734 --> 01:37:17,634
The height record for a war boat of
That size is just under 20,000 feet.

1998
01:37:17,701 --> 01:37:20,634
We're after 30 with
A range of 5,000 miles.

1999
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:22,167
30,000?

2000
01:37:22,234 --> 01:37:24,667
Ha ha! That's way up, thursday.

2001
01:37:24,734 --> 01:37:26,067
6 miles?

2002
01:37:26,133 --> 01:37:27,400
Mm-hmm.

2003
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:28,767
Hi, darling!

2004
01:37:28,834 --> 01:37:31,267
I hear you're going to have
Lunch with a bunch of angels.

2005
01:37:31,334 --> 01:37:32,767
Are you jealous?

2006
01:37:32,834 --> 01:37:34,267
Speak for yourself.

2007
01:37:34,334 --> 01:37:36,067
She's going to have
Lunch with the general.

2008
01:37:36,133 --> 01:37:38,267
Where did you ever find
Anything like this, Lane?

2009
01:37:38,334 --> 01:37:40,601
I picked it off
A cloud, general.

2010
01:37:40,667 --> 01:37:43,133
I haven't seen
A cloud for so long.

2011
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,634
Darling, I'd love to take
That high ride with you.

2012
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:50,634
I've never asked you before. Can I
Be a bomb? I'll be twice as quiet.

2013
01:37:50,701 --> 01:37:53,434
You know what you'd be
With that dress on up there?

2014
01:37:53,501 --> 01:37:54,968
What would I be?

2015
01:37:55,033 --> 01:37:56,434
A little icicle.

2016
01:37:56,501 --> 01:37:57,734
With you?

2017
01:37:57,801 --> 01:37:59,467
When do you take off? Right away.

2018
01:37:59,534 --> 01:38:02,501
Give me 28,000, we'll call it a day.

2019
01:38:02,567 --> 01:38:03,501
Right, general?

2020
01:38:03,567 --> 01:38:04,901
Certainly.

2021
01:38:04,968 --> 01:38:06,968
But don't force her, man.
You've got a hotel on your hand.

2022
01:38:07,033 --> 01:38:09,801
What will you give me for everything
I get over 30? I feel in form.

2023
01:38:09,868 --> 01:38:12,667
You just get
30 and stop feeling.

2024
01:38:12,734 --> 01:38:14,934
Those are orders.
Right, general?

2025
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,934
Right.
She'll bust over 30.

2026
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,934
You stop fooling
And come home.

2027
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Yeah. Think of us waiting down here.

2028
01:38:21,067 --> 01:38:22,968
Yes. Think
Of your wife.

2029
01:38:23,033 --> 01:38:26,200
Yeah, yeah. I always think of thursday.

2030
01:38:28,567 --> 01:38:30,501
Come on. Get going. We
Want to get out of here.

2031
01:38:30,567 --> 01:38:32,167
Take your time,
Gunner. We're ready.

2032
01:38:32,234 --> 01:38:33,834
Yeah? You've been
Ready all day.

2033
01:38:33,901 --> 01:38:35,601
Listen, you do
The flying, and-

2034
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,667
Here, here. What's
The matter here?

2035
01:38:39,734 --> 01:38:41,167
Tell that guy-

2036
01:38:41,234 --> 01:38:42,868
I'll tell you.

2037
01:38:44,868 --> 01:38:48,000
What's the matter with you? You're not the
Guy I know anymore-drinking and fighting.

2038
01:38:48,067 --> 01:38:51,033
Yeah, and I'll tell you why, and
You're going to listen and like it.

2039
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,834
Then maybe you'll see...

2040
01:38:54,701 --> 01:38:56,701
What will I see?

2041
01:38:56,767 --> 01:38:59,701
You must be drunk.
I never heard such talk.

2042
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,667
Come on. We've got
To go to work.

2043
01:39:02,734 --> 01:39:04,934
Ok. I'm sober now.

2044
01:39:10,767 --> 01:39:12,200
Gunner, I...

2045
01:39:12,267 --> 01:39:14,501
Don't worry, ann.
I'll make up for that.

2046
01:39:14,567 --> 01:39:17,234
I won't let you
Down again.

2047
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:19,167
Ok, pal?

2048
01:39:20,801 --> 01:39:22,167
Ok, pal.

2049
01:39:23,634 --> 01:39:25,834
3 roads.
We'll walk 'em good.

2050
01:39:34,734 --> 01:39:36,300
Ok.

2051
01:40:08,934 --> 01:40:10,868
For a nice fella, you've
Certainly turned into a crab.

2052
01:40:10,934 --> 01:40:12,868
I never saw
Anything like it.

2053
01:40:12,934 --> 01:40:14,367
She lifts nice.

2054
01:40:14,434 --> 01:40:17,367
She'd do better if she didn't
Have so much weight in her.

2055
01:40:17,434 --> 01:40:19,567
You're heavier
Than lead these days.

2056
01:40:33,734 --> 01:40:35,501
Calling w.s.r.
From Lane.

2057
01:40:35,567 --> 01:40:36,634
Yes.

2058
01:40:36,701 --> 01:40:38,634
Lane at 7,000 feet.

2059
01:40:38,701 --> 01:40:40,667
Starting up
Through overcast.

2060
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:42,167
Going on instruments.

2061
01:40:42,234 --> 01:40:43,868
On north bead.

2062
01:40:56,567 --> 01:40:58,033
There she is.

2063
01:40:58,100 --> 01:40:59,501
We're coming, honey!

2064
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:01,033
There's the sky.

2065
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:03,234
Little alice
Blue gown.

2066
01:41:11,901 --> 01:41:13,367
W.s.r. From Lane.

2067
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:15,701
15,100.

2068
01:41:15,767 --> 01:41:18,701
On top first layer.

2069
01:41:18,767 --> 01:41:20,701
Switching over
To high blower.

2070
01:41:20,767 --> 01:41:22,667
We'll call you in 20.

2071
01:41:22,734 --> 01:41:24,200
That's right.

2072
01:41:24,267 --> 01:41:26,133
Switching over
To oxygen-

2073
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,334
Hot air to you.

2074
01:41:37,267 --> 01:41:38,501
W.s.r., Lane.

2075
01:41:38,567 --> 01:41:40,167
New record
For weight-

2076
01:41:40,234 --> 01:41:41,801
20,200.

2077
01:41:41,868 --> 01:41:43,667
Full throttle.

2078
01:41:43,734 --> 01:41:47,000
Manifold pressure-
34.5.

2079
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:49,634
Rate of climb-
600 feet.

2080
01:41:49,701 --> 01:41:52,167
Fuel flow-76.

2081
01:41:52,234 --> 01:41:54,667
R.p.m.-2,200.

2082
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:56,834
And it's 30 or bust.

2083
01:41:56,901 --> 01:41:58,667
Think nothing of it.

2084
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,701
Yeah. We're at 26.

2085
01:42:12,767 --> 01:42:15,200
Manifold pressure
Dropping.

2086
01:42:15,267 --> 01:42:17,067
We're about washed.

2087
01:42:19,734 --> 01:42:21,534
Turn the heat full on.

2088
01:42:21,601 --> 01:42:23,234
It is full on.

2089
01:42:34,701 --> 01:42:36,534
29,350.

2090
01:42:36,601 --> 01:42:39,167
Get up there,
Baby girl! Get up!

2091
01:42:39,234 --> 01:42:40,634
Can't hear you.

2092
01:42:40,701 --> 01:42:43,634
2-9-3-5-0.

2093
01:42:43,701 --> 01:42:47,834
29,350!

2094
01:42:47,901 --> 01:42:49,834
Never mind.

2095
01:42:49,901 --> 01:42:51,667
That washes that.

2096
01:42:58,767 --> 01:43:00,667
We're about through, too.
She's washed.

2097
01:43:00,734 --> 01:43:02,167
Oh, no, she's not.

2098
01:43:02,234 --> 01:43:04,133
She's choking
To death!

2099
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,334
30! 30, I tell you!

2100
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:13,334
Isn't this high enough?
What more do you want?

2101
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,367
I want 30. I said 30!

2102
01:43:15,434 --> 01:43:18,234
I want 30, and that's
The end of it!

2103
01:43:23,934 --> 01:43:25,634
50 more.

2104
01:43:25,701 --> 01:43:27,100
Squeeze!

2105
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:30,000
Squeeze! Squeeze!

2106
01:43:39,701 --> 01:43:41,133
She's over!

2107
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,601
Yay!
Yay!

2108
01:43:42,667 --> 01:43:44,834
Don't let her
Fall off!

2109
01:43:48,901 --> 01:43:51,367
It's the stabilizer!

2110
01:43:53,667 --> 01:43:56,367
W.s.r. From Lane.
W.s.r. From Lane!

2111
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:02,667
Let's see you get
A hotel out of a spin.

2112
01:44:02,734 --> 01:44:05,334
Wait till we get down. We'll let in
Some air. Feel all right, don't you?

2113
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,033
Oh, I feel charming.

2114
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,334
Why don't we ditch the sand?
She's got to be light.

2115
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,200
Plenty of time, pal.

2116
01:44:27,834 --> 01:44:29,234
Uh!

2117
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,067
Go on! Beat it!

2118
01:44:43,467 --> 01:44:45,834
Can you move any? Give me
An inch on that wheel!

2119
01:44:45,901 --> 01:44:48,501
No. Go on! Get out!

2120
01:47:03,701 --> 01:47:05,100
Gunner?

2121
01:47:05,167 --> 01:47:06,868
Gunner!

2122
01:47:09,701 --> 01:47:11,634
Jim.

2123
01:47:11,701 --> 01:47:13,667
What?

2124
01:47:13,734 --> 01:47:16,133
Are you all right?

2125
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:19,167
Yeah. Sure.

2126
01:47:19,234 --> 01:47:21,667
Aw, he's tough.

2127
01:47:21,734 --> 01:47:23,734
Hey, can you move any?

2128
01:47:23,801 --> 01:47:27,567
Sure.
I'm just taking it easy.

2129
01:47:27,634 --> 01:47:30,267
Don't do anything
Dumb on me.

2130
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:33,100
Jim?

2131
01:47:33,167 --> 01:47:35,601
What?

2132
01:47:35,667 --> 01:47:38,133
Just listen.

2133
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,133
I got so many words.

2134
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,167
Let me string 'em.

2135
01:47:43,868 --> 01:47:47,133
Don't take anyone
In my place.

2136
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,834
You're so dumb.

2137
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,701
You don't know
How good I was.

2138
01:47:52,767 --> 01:47:55,868
You just loved me.

2139
01:47:55,934 --> 01:47:58,667
And I was
Awful good, see?

2140
01:48:01,033 --> 01:48:03,234
Give ann a kiss.

2141
01:48:04,534 --> 01:48:05,868
Gunner.

2142
01:48:09,167 --> 01:48:11,868
Here's a break for me,
Though.

2143
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:18,334
I won't ever have to go home
And break the news to her.

2144
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,534
I leave the roads first.

2145
01:48:20,601 --> 01:48:22,167
Don't die...

2146
01:48:22,234 --> 01:48:24,167
For my sake.

2147
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:30,334
That's all
I'd come back for...

2148
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,033
If I could.

2149
01:49:04,601 --> 01:49:07,167
Oh, my dear boy.
I'm sorry.

2150
01:49:07,234 --> 01:49:08,901
Thanks.

2151
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:25,734
Why wasn't it you?

2152
01:49:25,801 --> 01:49:27,934
It couldn't have been
You, could it?

2153
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,334
Oh, no. I've got more
Coming to me.

2154
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,167
I've got to get all
That's coming to me.

2155
01:49:33,234 --> 01:49:35,667
Another year maybe,
Another year first.

2156
01:49:35,734 --> 01:49:38,501
I'll go crazy first!

2157
01:49:38,567 --> 01:49:42,167
Why don't you die
And leave me alone?

2158
01:49:50,767 --> 01:49:53,400
Got a kiss
For you, ann.

2159
01:49:55,267 --> 01:49:57,200
His last crack.

2160
01:49:57,267 --> 01:49:59,167
Go on. What else?

2161
01:49:59,234 --> 01:50:01,901
What are you
Going to say?

2162
01:50:03,267 --> 01:50:05,067
Your heart's
Bleeding.

2163
01:50:06,434 --> 01:50:08,767
Aren't you going
To say that?

2164
01:50:09,934 --> 01:50:11,868
My heart isn't
Bleeding a drop.

2165
01:50:11,934 --> 01:50:13,801
My memory of the gunner
Is beautiful.

2166
01:50:13,868 --> 01:50:15,701
I believe you.

2167
01:50:15,767 --> 01:50:17,200
You have no heart.

2168
01:50:17,267 --> 01:50:19,701
You don't know
What pain is.

2169
01:50:19,767 --> 01:50:21,701
But you'll have
Company.

2170
01:50:21,767 --> 01:50:24,734
I love you with
My heart, Jim Lane,

2171
01:50:24,801 --> 01:50:27,167
But it won't last
Much longer.

2172
01:50:27,234 --> 01:50:29,667
Pain is
Eating it away.

2173
01:50:29,734 --> 01:50:32,133
He died at his trade, didn't
He? What more do you want?

2174
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,167
That's great. Go right
Back up in the sky...

2175
01:50:35,234 --> 01:50:37,200
That awful sky!

2176
01:50:38,567 --> 01:50:40,701
Go up there
And stay!

2177
01:50:47,567 --> 01:50:50,200
We have nothing
To talk about, ann.

2178
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:02,200
Howdy.
Hello.

2179
01:51:02,267 --> 01:51:03,868
We had a little
Hard luck.

2180
01:51:03,934 --> 01:51:06,200
I don't know if it was
My fault or not.

2181
01:51:06,267 --> 01:51:07,701
Oh, I guess not.

2182
01:51:07,767 --> 01:51:09,701
You guessed it good.
28,000-cinch.

2183
01:51:09,767 --> 01:51:11,701
29-maybe.
30-good night.

2184
01:51:11,767 --> 01:51:13,701
Safe at 28, huh?
That's wonderful.

2185
01:51:13,767 --> 01:51:16,200
Who are you going
To give me now?

2186
01:51:16,267 --> 01:51:18,200
I don't know.
Who do you want?

2187
01:51:18,267 --> 01:51:19,701
Jerry carter's
All right.

2188
01:51:19,767 --> 01:51:21,200
Sure,
He's all right.

2189
01:51:21,267 --> 01:51:23,701
Ok with me. We'll take the
Sister ship up tomorrow.

2190
01:51:23,767 --> 01:51:25,701
Fine. How about a little layoff first?

2191
01:51:25,767 --> 01:51:27,634
I don't want any, see?
I'm a test pilot.

2192
01:51:27,701 --> 01:51:29,634
We live long enough
To build a floor up there

2193
01:51:29,701 --> 01:51:32,334
So that someday the world can go to
Bed on it. That's the idea, isn't it?

2194
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,801
You're
A tough man.

2195
01:51:33,868 --> 01:51:36,334
How else do you figure it? And
Listen, I haven't started yet.

2196
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,000
I'll go back up there.

2197
01:51:38,067 --> 01:51:40,667
I'm going back up there to pay the
Sky back for what she did to me today.

2198
01:51:40,734 --> 01:51:42,667
I'll pay her back.
I'll wring her neck!

2199
01:51:42,734 --> 01:51:44,667
And I'll show ann something she
Won't forget in a hurry either!

2200
01:51:44,734 --> 01:51:46,667
I'll show her! I'll go back
Up there, and I'll stay there!

2201
01:51:46,734 --> 01:51:48,634
I'll never come down!
I'll...

2202
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:50,667
What-what am I
Talking about?

2203
01:51:50,734 --> 01:51:54,167
I can't talk-what did you
Let me talk like this for?

2204
01:51:54,234 --> 01:51:56,367
What's the matter
With me?

2205
01:51:58,734 --> 01:52:00,367
You went home,
Didn't you?

2206
01:52:00,434 --> 01:52:02,334
I don't know. I don't
Know what came off.

2207
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,300
She's going screwy,
I guess. I don't know.

2208
01:52:04,367 --> 01:52:06,167
Maybe she's
In love with you.

2209
01:52:06,234 --> 01:52:09,734
Hmm. You should have been there.
It sounded more like she hated me.

2210
01:52:09,801 --> 01:52:14,701
If she doesn't love you, she's got
A mighty funny way of showing it.

2211
01:52:14,767 --> 01:52:18,701
You should have been with us
This morning after you went up.

2212
01:52:18,767 --> 01:52:21,200
When the general
Asked her for lunch,

2213
01:52:21,267 --> 01:52:24,234
She said until you
Came down, she was dead.

2214
01:52:29,167 --> 01:52:30,634
Did she say that?

2215
01:52:30,701 --> 01:52:33,334
Yes, sir. That's
Just what she said.

2216
01:52:34,968 --> 01:52:38,167
She's a nice girl. I always
Thought I got on with her all right.

2217
01:52:38,234 --> 01:52:41,667
I can see how another guy would
Hang around the house with her

2218
01:52:41,734 --> 01:52:45,167
And have a couple of babies and all
That applesauce, but that's not for me.

2219
01:52:45,234 --> 01:52:47,667
You know I'm right.
You know me.

2220
01:52:47,734 --> 01:52:49,667
Oh, sure, Jim.
I know.

2221
01:52:49,734 --> 01:52:52,667
It was in this very
Office I bawled you out

2222
01:52:52,734 --> 01:52:56,133
Because you brought a girl to
New york instead of a record.

2223
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,000
You remember that,
Don't you?

2224
01:52:58,067 --> 01:52:59,167
Yeah, sure.

2225
01:52:59,234 --> 01:53:01,000
Remember what
You called her?

2226
01:53:01,067 --> 01:53:02,834
You called her
Another peach.

2227
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,167
Yeah?

2228
01:53:04,234 --> 01:53:08,133
Yeah, and while she never
Got much of a start with me,

2229
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,901
I have to admit
She's just that.

2230
01:53:10,968 --> 01:53:15,200
She's a nice girl, but we
Got no business being married.

2231
01:53:15,267 --> 01:53:18,200
You can say this
Much for it anyway-

2232
01:53:18,267 --> 01:53:21,501
It comes in handy
Tonight because...

2233
01:53:21,567 --> 01:53:23,167
Well, Jim...

2234
01:53:23,234 --> 01:53:26,767
I think if that oil
Hadn't spouted over kansas

2235
01:53:26,834 --> 01:53:29,100
And she was
In kansas tonight

2236
01:53:29,167 --> 01:53:31,634
Instead of
In your home here,

2237
01:53:31,701 --> 01:53:33,634
It would be
Pretty tough.

2238
01:53:33,701 --> 01:53:35,334
Wouldn't it?

2239
01:53:36,701 --> 01:53:39,133
Ah... Yeah.
I'll give her that.

2240
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,601
I kind of wish
She knew that.

2241
01:53:41,667 --> 01:53:44,367
I think it
Would please her.

2242
01:53:45,734 --> 01:53:47,834
Do you think she'd
Like to hear that?

2243
01:53:47,901 --> 01:53:49,834
You know how it is.

2244
01:53:49,901 --> 01:53:52,167
You know how women take
Those little things.

2245
01:53:52,234 --> 01:53:54,734
Always seems to please them
For some reason or other.

2246
01:53:56,734 --> 01:53:58,133
It does, huh?

2247
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,667
Yes.

2248
01:53:59,734 --> 01:54:01,133
Yeah?

2249
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,167
Oh, yes.

2250
01:54:03,234 --> 01:54:05,200
Well, then...

2251
01:54:06,934 --> 01:54:09,634
Do you really think it would please
Her if I went home and told her that?

2252
01:54:09,701 --> 01:54:12,868
I think it would
Make her very happy.

2253
01:54:15,234 --> 01:54:18,701
Well... I don't mind
Doing that,

2254
01:54:18,767 --> 01:54:20,367
If you say so.

2255
01:54:20,434 --> 01:54:22,000
I'd say so, Jim.

2256
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,601
All right.

2257
01:54:26,667 --> 01:54:28,601
I guess I will.

2258
01:54:28,667 --> 01:54:30,400
Thanks for the advice.

2259
01:54:30,467 --> 01:54:32,334
That's
All right, Jim.

2260
01:54:48,067 --> 01:54:51,601
Thursday, this is Drake.
Say, listen, thursday,

2261
01:54:51,667 --> 01:54:54,701
Uh... I've just been
Talking to Jim.

2262
01:54:54,767 --> 01:54:57,167
Where is he?
Is he all right?

2263
01:54:57,234 --> 01:54:58,634
I said
Terrible things.

2264
01:54:58,701 --> 01:55:02,167
I know all about it. There's
Nothing to worry about at all.

2265
01:55:02,234 --> 01:55:04,267
He's on his way home.

2266
01:55:04,334 --> 01:55:09,234
Just listen, thursday, and I'm going to
Tell you something you're going to like.

2267
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,501
He's all through
Test piloting.

2268
01:55:11,567 --> 01:55:14,000
He's in love
With you, thursday.

2269
01:55:14,067 --> 01:55:15,501
Oh.

2270
01:55:15,567 --> 01:55:16,968
Yes, "oh."

2271
01:55:17,033 --> 01:55:20,367
He doesn't know this
Himself, but I'm telling you,

2272
01:55:20,434 --> 01:55:23,167
He'd rather be with you
Than in the sky,

2273
01:55:23,234 --> 01:55:26,601
And when a man's heart's down
Here, he's no more good up there.

2274
01:55:26,667 --> 01:55:28,100
Oh.

2275
01:55:28,167 --> 01:55:30,601
Don't ever let him know
Anything about it,

2276
01:55:30,667 --> 01:55:34,634
And pretty soon Mr. Jim Lane
Will be working on the ground,

2277
01:55:34,701 --> 01:55:37,567
And he'll never know
How he got there.

2278
01:55:37,634 --> 01:55:39,601
Oh, Mr. Drake,
Are you sure?

2279
01:55:39,667 --> 01:55:42,601
I've only made one mistake
In my life, thursday,

2280
01:55:42,667 --> 01:55:46,601
And that's the first time
I saw you from a distance.

2281
01:55:46,667 --> 01:55:48,100
Good-bye, thursday.

2282
01:55:48,167 --> 01:55:51,467
You're going to hear a lot
Of squawking from him,

2283
01:55:51,534 --> 01:55:53,968
But don't let that
Bother you.

2284
01:55:54,033 --> 01:55:57,634
Just smile up your sleeve
And let him squawk.

2285
01:55:57,701 --> 01:56:00,701
I won't mind
The squawking.

2286
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:03,868
I'll just...

2287
01:56:05,234 --> 01:56:06,868
What's that,
Thursday?

2288
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:14,868
I said, I hope he squawks
And squawks and squawks.

2289
01:56:17,567 --> 01:56:19,167
I've been talking for
30 minutes to you boys,

2290
01:56:19,234 --> 01:56:21,167
And you're probably looking
Wise and giving me the bird.

2291
01:56:21,234 --> 01:56:23,667
I don't know what I'm doing here
Talking to you in the first place.

2292
01:56:23,734 --> 01:56:26,467
I got out of the army once,
And I don't know how I got back.

2293
01:56:26,534 --> 01:56:29,968
And I'm not flying. I'm talking,
If you can beat that one.

2294
01:56:30,033 --> 01:56:31,534
Anybody got
Any questions?

2295
01:56:31,601 --> 01:56:35,133
All right. Uh...
Good luck and...

2296
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,767
And, uh... Well,
Go on and get in.

2297
01:57:38,367 --> 01:57:40,601
What's the idea? What are
You doing over here anyway?

2298
01:57:40,667 --> 01:57:42,634
You weren't here when I
Was handing out the baloney.

2299
01:57:42,701 --> 01:57:44,300
Yes, dear,
We were here.

2300
01:57:44,367 --> 01:57:45,467
We?

2301
01:57:45,534 --> 01:57:47,968
Hello, pal. How are you?
I didn't see you.

2302
01:57:48,033 --> 01:57:51,467
Haven't I told you not to bring
The kid around a place like this?

2303
01:57:51,534 --> 01:57:54,133
Do you know how many
Engines there are over there?

2304
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:57,367
Don't you realize that his ears
Are delicate? Might hurt him.

2305
01:57:59,467 --> 01:58:01,434
What's the matter with
Those guys, anyway?

2306
01:58:01,501 --> 01:58:03,901
Come on, barney. Get up
There. What's eating you?

2307
01:58:07,133 --> 01:58:08,901
I bet you
They don't make it.

2308
01:58:08,968 --> 01:58:10,934
I don't know why I'm not
Up there in front of them.

2309
01:58:11,033 --> 01:58:13,133
A man spends his whole
Life getting somewhere,

2310
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,167
And where
Does he end up?

2311
01:58:15,234 --> 01:58:17,033
Nowhere, just where
He started.

2312
01:58:18,305 --> 01:59:18,369
