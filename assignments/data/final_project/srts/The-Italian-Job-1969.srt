1
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,798
- Domenico.
- Go on, let him sleep.

2
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,095
- Well, you know...
- Oh, Lord.

3
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,232
All right, you tell him
to do his best.

4
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,602
He's not a child anymore.
He knows what to do.

5
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,904
- Okay. Is there ham in here?
- Yes.

6
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,843
You don't get chances like this
every day.

7
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,641
Tell him to do his best.

8
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,442
Can you do me a favour?

9
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:30,247
Could you go to the store?
I've run out of oil.

10
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,617
- What kind of oil?
- The one in the can.

11
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,953
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

12
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,744
- Franco.
- What?

13
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,612
Hurry up.
You still have homework to do.

14
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,643
Okay, I'm coming.

15
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,897
CRITICS' AWARD, VENICE 1961

16
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,477
''For those who live
in the towns of Lombardy,

17
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,242
Milan is the place to find a job.''

18
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,486
It's always the same with you.

19
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,988
You have plenty of time,

20
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,249
but you wait till the last minute.

21
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,450
Your father is always upset.

22
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,721
One of these days he'll get tired of this.

23
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,899
- Where are my books?
- In the kitchen, I bet.

24
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,903
Look at him. He can't even
keep track of his books.

25
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,197
Who said you could use
my book strap?

26
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,898
Make sure you put it back.

27
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,632
Don't be a smart aleck with me.

28
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,599
And don't shrug either, you hear?

29
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,143
- Now what?
- It's about his book strap.

30
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,316
I gave it to him.
Leave him alone.

31
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,212
You're not a child.

32
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,219
What do you need it for?

33
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,118
You're going to work.

34
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,453
These two are unbelievable,
the way they fight.

35
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,489
Like cats and dogs.
Not like brothers at all.

36
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,093
The envelope!
What if you forgot it at the exam?

37
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,804
Your father is very worried.

38
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,098
This is the chance of a lifetime.

39
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,277
If you get in there,
you've got a job for life.

40
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,105
Listen to me.

41
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,642
- Do you have a handkerchief?
- Yes.

42
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,651
- Do you have enough money?
- I don't know.

43
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,423
- Morning, Miss Ida.
- Morning.

44
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,489
But I gave you 1,000 lire!

45
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,457
Well, I have to eat, don't I?

46
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,928
How much do you need?
Aren't you going to the café?

47
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,626
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

48
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,700
You always go to the café.

49
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,393
Domenico.

50
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,088
Here, take this.
- That's okay.

51
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,200
Franco, come here.

52
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:12,143
Give it to your brother,
and tell him I want some change.

53
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,407
- Knock it off..
- Why?

54
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,236
You act tough,
but you're such a romantic.

55
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,075
Is your class co-ed?
You're so lucky.

56
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,808
I still go to a Catholic school.

57
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,029
That little boy is going to school.

58
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,945
Excuse me.

59
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,485
The boss!

60
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,047
Good morning, sir.

61
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,490
- Can I help you?
- Well, I...

62
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,034
Fourth floor. Human Resources.

63
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,240
- I'm here for the test.
- Fourth floor.

64
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:04,406
Excuse me, could you direct me
to the welfare office?

65
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,347
What?

66
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,420
Where they help out poor people.

67
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,930
The nerve of this guy!

68
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,158
The minute he walks in,
he starts yelling, the idiot!

69
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,429
- And you?
- Nothing.

70
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:01,038
When he was done, I said:
''I may be a messenger,

71
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,639
but you're a real ass.

72
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,333
And I'm certainly not your slave.''

73
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,743
My job is not to fetch him
sandwiches for his snack!

74
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,778
What did he say?

75
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,179
- Not a word.
- Good for you.

76
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,921
We'll come by for the results, then.

77
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,189
Let me know as soon as
you get his results.

78
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,886
Of course, count on it.

79
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,488
And thanks again.

80
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,827
It's my pleasure, ma'am.

81
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,832
- Thank you.
- Once again...

82
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,028
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

83
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,298
Ignazio, say good-bye.

84
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,203
Good-bye, young man.

85
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,771
Thank you.

86
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,013
Come here.

87
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,782
Did you hear what he said?

88
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,953
That guy,

89
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,119
he's as good as hired.
He's got connections.

90
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,188
I don't think so.
The test is what really counts.

91
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,299
If you don't pass the test,
they won't hire you.

92
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:44,198
Is the aptitude test really
the most important part?

93
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,408
I'm not sure.

94
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,742
I took an aptitude test
for the army once.

95
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,596
Good morning, applicants.

96
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,591
I represent the company,

97
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,066
and I will supervise the testing.

98
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,600
As you know, these tests

99
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:17,037
are designed mainly to reveal
your individual qualities.

100
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,667
The aptitude test.

101
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,644
You shouldn't worry.
They are very simple.

102
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,944
You will easily pass them.

103
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:30,482
And now, as soon as
I've taken attendance,

104
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,352
the clerk will give you
your test papers.

105
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,194
Bernasconi, Giuseppe.
- Here.

106
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,930
- Bonfanti, Attilio.
- Here.

107
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,794
- Cantoni, Domenico.
- Here.

108
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,993
- Cappelli, Guido.
- Here.

109
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,095
- Cavallaro, Elisabetta.
- Here.

110
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,898
Colombo, Carlo.

111
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,574
Is Colombo, Carlo, not here?

112
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,238
Guacci, Corrado.
- Here.

113
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,348
- Lanzoni, Ignazio.
- Here.

114
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,516
The boy.

115
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,521
- Locascio, Attilio.
- Here.

116
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,147
- Masetti, Antonia.
- Here.

117
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,826
- Monguzzi, Ar...
- Artene.

118
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,488
With an ''n''.
It's misspelled in the letter.

119
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,824
That's easily fixed.

120
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,624
Noseda, Filippo.
- Here.

121
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,234
Poletti, Luciana.
Ponzoni, Ernesto.

122
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,438
- What's going on?
- Tests.

123
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,274
What for?

124
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,873
If we pass the test, we get a job.

125
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,918
What will they think of next?

126
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,448
All right, everyone take a seat.

127
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,843
Spread out.
There's plenty of room.

128
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,548
If you like, you may remove
your coats.

129
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,119
You'll find paper and pencils
in your desks.

130
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,420
The paper is stamped
and cannot be replaced.

131
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,632
If you make a mistake,
simply correct it.

132
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,399
Here's your problem:

133
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,699
We have a roll of copper wire

134
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,502
520 meters long.

135
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,680
520 meters.

136
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,115
Three-quarters of it are cut off.

137
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:53,182
Of the remainder, we cut off

138
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,489
four-fifths.

139
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:02,924
How many centimetres of wire
are left on the roll?

140
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,263
That's it.

141
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,163
One hour's time.

142
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,634
You may begin.

143
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,793
- Here, sir.
- Done already?

144
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,190
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

145
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,159
Return to your desk.

146
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,351
Applicants, your time is up.

147
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,820
Please hand in your work.

148
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,525
Please hand me your test.
You, too. Thank you.

149
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,229
What about you?

150
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,632
It's all right. Leave it.

151
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,000
Hand it in as it is.

152
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:23,071
Spaghetti, plain and with sauce.
The water's coming.

153
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,278
Hello. You'd like to eat?
Have a seat in the kitchen.

154
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,845
Take the gentleman's order.

155
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,213
Here's your water.

156
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,416
I'll be right with you.

157
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,052
Grilled steak, no pepper.

158
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,538
Rice, pasta with butter, soup?

159
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,002
Spaghetti with butter.

160
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,042
- Steak, cheese or fried eggs?
- Eggs.

161
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,079
Mineral water, orange soda
or Coca-Cola? All right.

162
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,649
No, this is the gentleman's.

163
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,320
Hand me the paper.

164
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,203
''Beats elderly mother.

165
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,009
Traces of blood on stairs.

166
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,721
Attempts to kill wife

167
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,360
chasing her through the fields,

168
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,053
brandishing an axe.

169
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,066
The temperature will drop slightly.

170
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,333
Snow in the Alps.

171
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,668
Fog in the Po Valley.''

172
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,243
Hi. I took the test with you.

173
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,881
Oh, hi.

174
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,141
They said we had to be back
by 3:00, right?

175
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,683
They also said
it's better to be early.

176
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,383
- Are you from out of town?
- No, why?

177
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,083
I saw you eating at the café.

178
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,729
There's no one home.
My mother works.

179
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,060
The food at the café isn't bad.

180
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,133
You know what, though?

181
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,608
Smell.

182
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,108
Can't you smell it?
- No.

183
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,247
It stinks of fried food.

184
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,118
Well, we ate in the kitchen.

185
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,754
No, it's the café.
Want some?

186
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,423
Just a little.

187
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,025
Just a drop on your finger.
It's perfume.

188
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,289
What are you doing?
- It'll go up my nose.

189
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,431
What a dunce!

190
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,133
There, now you're like a young lady.

191
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,534
What was your answer
to the problem?

192
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,765
Twenty-four.

193
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,002
Mine, too.
It wasn't very hard.

194
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,043
No, not at all.

195
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,172
Did you see the man
near the window?

196
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,044
The one with the raincoat?

197
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,688
Poor guy. Maybe he'd forgotten
the formula.

198
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:02,486
He was married.
He was wearing a wedding ring.

199
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,787
Did you go to secretary school?

200
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,625
No, middle school.
I wanted to study languages.

201
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,834
But I gave it up.

202
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,863
Sooner or later I'll get married,
and that will be that.

203
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:18,872
Nice.

204
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,970
I like the ones
with lots of buttons and belts.

205
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,877
I like casual clothing.

206
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:34,584
If I get the job, I'm going to buy
a motorcycle with my father.

207
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,992
He already has a scooter.

208
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,824
If we buy one together,
it will be a 150.

209
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,557
Do you know how to drive?

210
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,328
Sure. I've driven my father's
several times.

211
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,735
But that's just a scooter.
A 150 is different.

212
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,205
I bet he has a moped.

213
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,613
How much do you think
they'll pay us?

214
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,053
- I don't know.
- How much would you like?

215
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,563
Well, if I had my choice...

216
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,358
What choice? Why not wish
for a million lire then?

217
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,697
If I get 35,000 lire a month,

218
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,668
that'll be plenty.
It's my first job.

219
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:32,281
My father says that
these big companies don't pay much.

220
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:36,487
But you have a secure job for life.

221
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,690
Can you smell the coffee?

222
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,666
Shall we get one?

223
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,838
Let's.

224
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,655
- Two coffees.
- Is it your treat?

225
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,790
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

226
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,366
Thank you, sir.

227
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,174
Thank you, sir.

228
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,181
He called you sir.

229
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,892
Let's move out of the way.

230
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,530
It's so crowded.

231
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,185
- What is it?
- I dropped my teaspoon.

232
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,655
We can share mine.

233
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,885
- How is it?
- Good.

234
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:49,876
A little bitter.

235
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,973
They don't know what they're doing.

236
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:13,940
They must have started over here
at least seven times.

237
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:18,641
There are too many bosses.
They act like they're all engineers.

238
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,734
- Come here a second.
- It's after 2:30 already.

239
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,496
Good-bye.

240
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:03,513
You can't run on the grass!
This is the road.

241
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,658
- We're late.
- You should have left earlier.

242
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,454
Lift your arms.

243
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:15,025
Arms straight up, fingers spread apart.
Rotate your hands.

244
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,999
Pretend you're unscrewing
a light bulb, like this.

245
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,172
Arms out in front,
level with your chin.

246
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,337
Palms up.

247
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,243
Palms down.

248
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,750
Palms up.
Palms down.

249
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,418
Wait for me to tell you.

250
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,325
Palms up.
Palms down.

251
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,733
Keep your hands out in front,
level with your chin.

252
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,367
Bend your knees in a squat.

253
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,335
The young ladies can turn
to face the wall.

254
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,313
Squat.

255
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,214
That's enough. Good.

256
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,611
Now, everyone gather in the corner.

257
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,380
Call the first applicant.

258
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,189
Come with me.

259
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,490
No, face the wall.

260
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,467
Repeat out loud
everything the doctor says.

261
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,408
Seventeen.

262
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,538
Ruptured spleen.

263
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,017
Fifty-two.

264
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,148
I couldn't hear it.

265
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:48,921
Please sit down.

266
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:54,890
You must answer my questions
with either yes or no.

267
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,694
Nothing else. Is that clear?

268
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,639
Do you mind eating away from home?

269
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,033
Do you mind eating away from home?

270
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,153
Does the future seem hopeless to you?

271
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,857
Do you suffer from frequent itching?

272
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:30,296
Did you wet the bed
between the ages of 8 and 14?

273
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:38,700
Has excessive drunkenness
ever caused you to lose your job?

274
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,638
Does the opposite sex repulse you?

275
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,115
Do you often drink
to forget your troubles?

276
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:55,823
Sometimes.

277
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,259
Not sometimes. Yes or no.

278
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,671
Hi.

279
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,876
Did you wait for me?
- I got out early.

280
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,451
- How did it go?
- Fine.

281
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,553
Me too.

282
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,717
Who questioned you?

283
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:29,690
The one with the long smock.
The one who did the squats.

284
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,221
What's so funny?

285
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,922
They asked me such weird questions.

286
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,432
Yeah, me too.

287
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,630
If it went well,
do you think they'll hire us?

288
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,206
Why would they have
recruited us otherwise?

289
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,814
What bus are you taking?

290
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,748
I'll walk. It's just two stops
to the station.

291
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,057
I'll walk with you.
It's still early.

292
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,785
Want some gum?

293
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,456
Sure.

294
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,671
- What are you doing?
- It's not working.

295
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,899
- You have to put money in.
- I did.

296
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,942
It must be broken.
Are you trying to break the window?

297
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,942
What an idiot!

298
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,742
Now you lost ten lire.

299
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,018
Where do you live?
- In Meda.

300
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,830
- What's your name?
- Cantoni.

301
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,828
I meant your first name.

302
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,466
Domenico.

303
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,597
That's so old-fashioned.

304
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,670
- What about you?
- What?

305
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,103
- What's your name?
- Magalí.

306
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,673
What kind of a name is that?

307
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,471
It's French.

308
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,181
Are you French?

309
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,645
A boy on my block
gave me the nickname.

310
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,688
He didn't like my name
and started calling me Magalí.

311
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,120
Now everyone does.

312
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,829
- What's your real name?
- Antonietta.

313
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,363
Antonietta's not bad either.

314
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,059
I have two names
on my birth certificate,

315
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,363
but everyone calls me Domenico.

316
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,000
What's the other one?
Maybe it's nicer.

317
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,709
I think it's Trieste.

318
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,376
What kind of a name is that?

319
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,380
Maybe it's in honour of when
Trieste became Italian.

320
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,257
This isn't my bus.
I'm going to San Siro.

321
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,223
If you want to go, feel free.

322
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,627
No, there's a train I can catch
every half hour.

323
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,489
You know what?

324
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,689
Domenico suits you.

325
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,194
Why?

326
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,627
Because you're old-fashioned, too.

327
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,103
I have to go. Bye.

328
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,907
- Maybe I'll see you sometime.
- Yes, if we get the job.

329
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,350
I hope so. Bye.

330
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,748
Just one more kiss

331
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:20,750
And then forever I shall lose you

332
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,260
Just like a fairy tale

333
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,432
Then it is gone

334
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,911
THIS CAR OUT OF SERVICE

335
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,485
I struggle to find

336
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,293
New words to say

337
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,690
But as it rains

338
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,058
I cry with you

339
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,065
I struggle to find

340
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,669
New words to say

341
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,740
But as it rains

342
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,339
I cry with you

343
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,479
Good-bye, little girl

344
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,653
Just one more kiss

345
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:29,421
And then forever I shall lose you

346
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:35,825
I struggle to find
New words to say

347
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,195
But as it rains

348
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,574
I cry with you

349
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,050
- Hello.
- Hi.

350
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,374
- Well, how did it go?
- Fine.

351
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,809
- What do you mean?
- Fine.

352
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,648
Come on, tell us what happened.

353
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,449
We wrote an essay,
solved a problem,

354
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,454
and in the afternoon
we took the aptitude test.

355
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,430
How do you like this one, ma'am?

356
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,666
Dirt won't show up so much
on this one.

357
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,776
- What about that one?
- That one costs about 26,000 lire.

358
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,312
No, I've already spent
way too much.

359
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,916
All because he's going to work.

360
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,349
Show me something else.
That one, for instance.

361
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,883
Yes, that one.

362
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,752
- Is it still raining?
- I don't know.

363
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,296
Is it overcast or not?

364
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,666
Overcast.

365
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,408
- Domenico.
- What?

366
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,109
Turn the light off..
It's late.

367
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,515
All right.

368
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,678
Otherwise, in the morning
not even trumpets will wake you.

369
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,934
You're not wearing your raincoat!

370
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,838
The sun's coming out.

371
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,104
Turn your collar down.

372
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,943
You'll ruin it, with all the grease
you put in your hair.

373
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,135
- Morning, Michele.
- Hi.

374
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,531
Just four at a time.

375
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,654
- Bacon?
- Yes, bacon.

376
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,731
Good morning.

377
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,159
Good morning.

378
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,108
- You're here too?
- Yeah.

379
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,281
Good morning.

380
00:41:58,949 --> 00:41:59,608
Excuse me.

381
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,617
- I'm sorry.
- It's nothing.

382
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,186
Good morning.

383
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,756
Sit down.

384
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,402
- See?
- What?

385
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,903
They hired us.

386
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,198
- What did your parents say?
- They were pleased.

387
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,603
So was my mother.

388
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,586
All these people
took the test with us.

389
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,285
There aren't many of us.

390
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,991
I wonder about the others.

391
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,033
I guess they weren't hired.

392
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,939
We sure were lucky.
- You bet.

393
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,942
- Are Duraschi and Ponzoni here?
- I'm Ponzoni.

394
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,942
- Come with me. What about Duraschi?
- Sorry I'm late.

395
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,612
My bus was late
due to the subway incident.

396
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,081
You're lucky you're not punching in yet.
Today you'd have a red stamp.

397
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,844
Starting tomorrow,
take an earlier bus.

398
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,454
Come with me.
- Of course.

399
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,353
I'll be with you in a minute.

400
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,059
I heard you.

401
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,437
Do you think they'll call us
in alphabetical order?

402
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,472
No. Ponzoni comes after me.
My name starts with C.

403
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,738
Yeah, mine starts with M.

404
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,080
It's hot in here.

405
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,651
No, it's not hot.

406
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:54,346
It's nerves.
My palms are sweating, too.

407
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,789
Cappelli,

408
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,187
Cavallaro and Cantoni.

409
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,128
That's me.

410
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,733
Bye.

411
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,997
I'll see you later.

412
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,180
- Are we going outside?
- You're in another department.

413
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,260
Administration.

414
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:37,691
You'll see, it's much better
to be out of the way.

415
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,700
- Sartori.
- Yes, miss.

416
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,702
- Bring him in.
- Yes, miss.

417
00:45:58,555 --> 00:45:59,715
Come in.

418
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,796
Please sit down.

419
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,419
I don't know if Human Resources
informed you.

420
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,656
Right now we don't need
clerical employees here.

421
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,053
Actually, I had requested
a messenger.

422
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:18,363
Sooner or later
we'll find a position for you.

423
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,370
What kind of schooling
have you had?

424
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,445
I went to middle school.
I wanted to be a surveyor.

425
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,410
But since I have
a younger brother in school,

426
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,879
we decided that I would...

427
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,450
Come in.

428
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,319
Do you intend
to further your education?

429
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,759
I might go to night school.

430
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,832
Where there's a will, there's a way.

431
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,530
Yes, that's true.

432
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,335
Listen.

433
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,170
For now there is
a messenger position, if you want it.

434
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,212
Better than staying home
doing nothing.

435
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,043
You can start settling in,

436
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,276
getting to know the department.

437
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:45,715
Come in.

438
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:55,055
Excuse me, sir.
Here's my excuse for being late.

439
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,859
This is the third time,
if I'm not mistaken,

440
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,493
and it's only the beginning
of the month.

441
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:05,473
Your children are grown,
aren't they?

442
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,872
They should be able
to take care of themselves.

443
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,847
Please introduce him to Sartori.

444
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,522
Tell him to show him the ropes.

445
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,161
Tell him to keep him busy.

446
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,965
All right.

447
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,467
You can go with her.

448
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,438
And be wise: Use your head.

449
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,009
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

450
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,393
Sartori, the chief is entrusting
this young man to you.

451
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,228
He wants you
to show him the ropes.

452
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,637
- Who's he?
- The new messenger.

453
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,269
- What's he like?
- Cute, and so young.

454
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,046
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

455
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,207
The accountant
sent me this one from Selvino.

456
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,711
He goes on vacation every year.

457
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,829
Let them ring.

458
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,664
When they get tired, they'll stop.

459
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:56,210
Here everybody's got a bad habit:
Everything's urgent.

460
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,176
They're all in a hurry.

461
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,718
Instead of warming their chairs all day,

462
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,548
they should go outside
for some fresh air.

463
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,756
At least that's healthy.

464
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,147
Sir, did you see what happened?

465
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,321
- What?
- The light bulb blew out.

466
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,958
Again? These bulbs
don't last very long.

467
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,787
I had nothing to do with it,
you know.

468
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:55,429
I just do my work... and pow!
They just blow out.

469
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,575
Could you take a look at this, sir?

470
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,057
- Is it dated today?
- Yes.

471
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,672
My dear Don Luigi,

472
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,978
could you lend me a cigarette?

473
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,238
What about it, dear friend?

474
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,277
Jeez, one stinking cigarette!

475
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,266
I think he's a toady.

476
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,258
A brownnose.

477
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,462
He never looks anyone in the eye.

478
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,436
Not Sleepyhead.
He can hardly see.

479
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,982
Go ahead,
keep all the lights on!

480
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:58,111
He doesn't pay the bill!
What could he have to write about?

481
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,448
God only knows.
- What does he write about?

482
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:03,558
Who knows? Maybe a novel.

483
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,769
''Another mystery...

484
00:56:55,845 --> 00:57:00,714
Why couldn't he remember
the trip with his friend?''

485
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,882
Just a little on the sideburns.

486
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,152
Just a little.

487
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:31,745
- Who is it?
- It's Mrs. Seminari.

488
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,348
Some guests have arrived
and I'm out of coffee.

489
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:38,715
I'm so sorry.
I haven't got any either.

490
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,855
I can't drink it
because of my heart.

491
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:44,857
In the morning my husband
takes Ovaltine with his milk.

492
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,320
I'm sorry.
I really haven't got any.

493
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,374
Don Luigi, a man was here today.

494
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:02,044
He's an old friend of our poor uncle.

495
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:06,715
He says Uncle collected
the ''Domenica del Corriere.''

496
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,545
He'd like to buy the collection.
At a good price, of course.

497
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,921
As you know, here at the ''Casello''
only real singers are allowed to sing.

498
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:24,361
Speaking of real singers,
it's my pleasure to introduce

499
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:28,532
a man with a golden voice,
our beloved Carletto,

500
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:33,000
who will sing
his piéce de résistance.

501
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,369
Maestro.

502
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,672
Go, Carlo.

503
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:38,940
Go, Carletto!

504
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:44,179
Imagine, almost 60
and he still sings I Puritani.

505
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,948
Next it'll be your turn to sing.

506
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,589
- Is your mother home?
- Come in.

507
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,529
Please come in, Miss Regina.

508
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,996
It's one pound.

509
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,535
Thank you. How much do I owe you?

510
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,830
The usual:
120 lire per quarter pound.

511
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,769
But if you're short of cash,
you can pay me tomorrow.

512
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:43,173
No, just a minute.
Let me look in my wallet.

513
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:41,236
If they were my kids,
I'd tan their hides.

514
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,735
Thank the Lord you don't have any.

515
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,636
Otherwise you'd be just like her.

516
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,578
Or worse.

517
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,942
One, two, three.

518
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,950
Flick or flock.

519
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,413
Damn!

520
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,934
Has the bell rung?

521
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,637
One more minute.

522
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,907
Well, I'd better get going

523
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,278
if I want to avoid the crowd.

524
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:40,053
- Good day.
- Enjoy your lunch, Mr. Tresoldi.

525
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,888
Thank you. You too.

526
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,535
He baffles me.

527
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,731
Retired three months now,
and he keeps coming in.

528
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,432
He sits there napping
and waits for the bell.

529
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,806
God only knows why he keeps coming.

530
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,312
When I get to retire,

531
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,851
they won't see me here,
that's for sure.

532
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:15,092
Mr. Tresoldi, how are you?
You look great.

533
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,459
Like a young man.
Take care, eh?

534
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:24,102
- Who's this nice young man?
- A new employee.

535
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,831
Be a good boy,
and you'll be very happy here.

536
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,739
It's like a big family here.
Good-bye.

537
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,837
Good-bye, sir.

538
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,448
- What a nice person.
- Yeah.

539
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:40,986
In any case, your best bet

540
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,857
is to keep to yourself.

541
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,853
In this life,
we should trust everyone,

542
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:51,465
except those who have two nostrils.

543
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:34,906
It's my teeth.

544
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:40,104
It's tough, eating with no teeth.

545
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,215
It's no fun getting old.

546
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,555
You expecting someone?

547
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,493
- A friend.
- What's her name?

548
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:03,935
I don't know.

549
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,274
What department is she in?

550
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,635
I'm not sure.

551
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,941
Is she in the main building?

552
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,647
I think so.

553
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:19,712
Second shift.

554
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:23,648
The main building has lunch
with the second shift.

555
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,361
As we leave, they come in.
Get it?

556
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,962
It's starting to rain.

557
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:07,193
There you are. Well?

558
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,063
Did you find her?

559
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,868
No?

560
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,447
How about this rain?

561
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,950
Don't you have an umbrella?

562
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,916
Come on, you can walk with me.
- No, thanks.

563
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,388
You're not ashamed to be seen
with an old lady?

564
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:31,024
Come on, young man.

565
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,632
Well, well!
You look like a general.

566
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,934
Sartori.

567
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,699
What's your name?
- Cantoni.

568
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,906
Here you are.

569
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,592
My wife gave me
a big kiss this morning.

570
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,292
I only get kisses once a month,
on payday.

571
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,593
What are you, an officer with the SS?

572
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,502
So, can I go?

573
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,537
Go, go,
you're making me breathless.

574
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,936
Sartori, what about that letter?

575
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,373
What letter?
I don't have any letter.

576
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,929
Look at this rain!

577
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:26,001
It's freezing.

578
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,170
- Where shall we go?
- Let's go to the fair.

579
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,802
- It'll be closed.
- Where to then?

580
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,372
Come on, let's go to the fair.

581
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,067
It's settled, then.

582
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,586
Mail for the administration.

583
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:56,121
Leave it. Someone will take care of it.
This place is a mess.

584
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,840
Hi.

585
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,502
Hi.

586
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,738
Where did you disappear to?

587
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:23,144
I'm in another building.

588
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:24,876
The administration department.

589
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,544
How are you?

590
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:28,421
Fine.

591
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:32,156
I hardly recognized you
in that uniform.

592
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:37,257
They don't need clerks
at the moment,

593
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:41,334
but they promised me a job
as soon as one is available.

594
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,869
Here, once you're in...

595
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,942
I'm working as a typist.

596
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,532
I know.

597
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,156
Why haven't you been to see me?

598
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,157
I get out fifteen minutes later.

599
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,853
And I'm on the first lunch shift.

600
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,358
Why don't you come to the dance?

601
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:14,866
The CRAL is throwing a party
on New Year's Eve.

602
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:18,631
I'm hoping my mother
will let me go.

603
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:22,536
We'll be among
friends and colleagues.

604
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,040
It sounds nice.

605
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,842
My supervisor.

606
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:37,320
I've got to go. I don't want her
to see me talking in the hall.

607
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:38,959
Bye.

608
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:42,930
And Merry Christmas.

609
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:53,841
I'm going to Angelo's to watch TV.

610
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,501
Come right back up. It's late
to be going to people's homes.

611
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,407
Radio News

612
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,016
What's the latest?

613
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:12,022
The prime minister wishes
everyone a Happy New Year.

614
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,919
In Genoa they're throwing
a dinner party for 10,000 people.

615
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:18,725
Some melancholy burglars
give back their loot.

616
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,630
Take this.
And don't be too late.

617
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:02,470
Well, I certainly didn't go out
at night at his age.

618
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,336
Not even on New Year's Eve.

619
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,881
It's just the workers' social club.
You know, the CRAL.

620
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,248
Yeah, well, meanwhile he's gone out.

621
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,855
These kids are always right.

622
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:17,718
They'll talk you blind
and always get out of everything.

623
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:30,756
Good evening. Come in.

624
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,325
Give him a ticket.
- Here you are.

625
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,265
- Here's a nice hat for you.
- No, that's a woman's hat.

626
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,997
- It doesn't matter.
- Here, take this one.

627
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:42,006
Give him a party favour.
You've got to blow, though.

628
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,372
- Give him a bottle of champagne.
- Here it is.

629
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,072
Each man should have a lady.

630
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:49,944
Or, if he's alone,
a bottle of wine.

631
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:51,584
Are you alone?

632
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,448
Does he have a girlfriend?

633
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,852
Please take this bottle,
with our compliments.

634
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,720
Please go inside.
- Enjoy the evening.

635
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,210
See, he got a bottle.

636
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:27,840
Expecting someone?

637
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:32,745
Join us.

638
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,645
What are you doing there
all by yourself?

639
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:47,490
The bottle.

640
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,770
Shall we sit there?

641
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:03,436
Come on. Take my purse.
Have a seat.

642
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,841
Good evening.

643
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,846
That's better.
What's the point of sitting all alone?

644
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:11,810
Don't you agree?
- Yes.

645
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:24,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
not one couple is dancing.

646
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:26,499
We're here to enjoy ourselves.

647
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:30,435
This evening should be unforgettable.

648
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:32,800
Everyone is invited.

649
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:36,273
So we've planned
a nice surprise for you.

650
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,638
- Where are you from?
- Meda.

651
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:41,207
What department are you in?

652
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,345
Administration.

653
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,543
I'm in the workshop.

654
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,686
''Abboccato del Garda.''

655
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,655
May I?

656
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:54,888
Of course.

657
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:09,667
We didn't get one
'cause we're a couple.

658
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:13,378
I can open it, if you like.

659
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,213
Are you the conductor?

660
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:23,050
Good evening.
Are you the conductor?

661
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,886
I'd like to sing an aria from Otello.

662
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,154
It's New Year's Eve.
That's not really appropriate.

663
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,460
What a nice head of foam.

664
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:39,505
Just a little.

665
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:43,235
It's not bad for you.
You'll piss it all out anyway.

666
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:45,673
It's New Year's Eve. Cheers.

667
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,175
Cheers.

668
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,744
- May I introduce my wife?
- How do you do?

669
01:19:56,191 --> 01:20:00,252
Ladies and gentlemen,
a little entertainment.

670
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:04,791
We have hired a great singer
and entertainer.

671
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,834
Singer, comedian...

672
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,268
Let's say just a singer,

673
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,837
and he's going to entertain you
with a humorous ballad.

674
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,511
He's a real character.

675
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:23,516
This is the story
of my poor automobile.

676
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:33,083
Friends, please sing along
while I sing you a sad song

677
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:38,927
It sounds like a nursery rhyme
that just sprang up from my mind

678
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:46,435
My family is such a riot
They just ate my whole car up

679
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:51,169
First it was Uncle Emory
who ate up the whole battery

680
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,138
The two Germans, Dink and Dunk

681
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,581
Ate up the entire trunk

682
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:02,817
I called the English to save the day
There goes the windshield, clean away

683
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:09,795
Then my cousin Hannibal
ate the chauffeur, the cannibal

684
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:17,801
Then his brother, cousin Orloff.
proceeded to chew the door off.

685
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:39,687
My friends, please listen up
for I'm about to clear it up

686
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,832
My old car, wouldn't you know it

687
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:47,834
Was made of the finest chocolate

688
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:53,137
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
more dancing.

689
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:55,341
Finally. It's about time.

690
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:10,152
May I have this dance, miss?

691
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:04,833
Don't you dance?

692
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,737
Come on, dance!

693
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:22,849
During this next dance,
a little cloud

694
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:26,024
will slowly move
in front of the spotlight.

695
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:28,229
Seize the moment.

696
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:31,728
But remember, you must be quick.

697
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:36,770
If you get caught in the act,
you're sure to be embarrassed.

698
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:42,607
So, fiancés, husbands, lovers,
on your feet.

699
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,367
This is your moment.

700
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,911
Mrs. Benedetti, please.

701
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:49,040
What's going on?

702
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:36,160
Here comes the cloud.

703
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,356
Go!

704
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:55,777
Go!

705
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:04,757
Why aren't you dancing?

706
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,790
Don't you know how?

707
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:15,826
Go on.

708
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:24,908
It's all right. I'll lead.

709
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,481
Come on.

710
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:50,903
Five, four, three...

711
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:52,267
It's midnight. Open the door.

712
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,135
Sound the trumpets.
Shoot the cannons.

713
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:59,138
Friends, we have killed off
the old year.

714
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:02,680
Let's raise our glasses
to the future.

715
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:05,479
An important announcement.

716
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:10,023
The company is being generous.

717
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:13,786
We wish to inform all engaged
and married couples

718
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:17,187
that they may kiss on the lips!

719
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:20,731
Go on, drink.
It'll cheer you up.

720
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:41,178
Go in one direction only,
and don't move backwards.

721
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:43,380
Try to stay in line.

722
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,923
Go on, ladies and gentlemen.

723
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,989
Go around the columns, too.

724
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:02,635
Personal.

725
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,169
Company.

726
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:09,632
This belongs to the company, too.

727
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:12,575
Personal.

728
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:16,414
What's this?

729
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:20,179
Chapter 19?

730
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:23,954
I'd say personal.

731
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:29,459
A feather.

732
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:31,492
Personal.

733
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,792
You may sit down now.

734
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:47,779
Get a load of that.
Unbelievable!

735
01:29:50,585 --> 01:29:53,247
He's just a kid
and he's jumped ahead of us.

736
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,492
As usual, the accountant
is being unfair.

737
01:29:58,593 --> 01:30:00,254
This time I'm going to speak up.

738
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,455
I've ruined my eyes
for 20 years with this lamp.

739
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:05,666
I can't go on like this.

740
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,201
- Actually, I'm the oldest.
- What are you talking about?

741
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,235
It's my turn!
He's in my seat!

742
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,634
Are you kidding?
I'm fed up!

743
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:16,833
This time I'm going
to tell it like it is.

744
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:20,813
There we go.

745
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:24,917
Sir, I'd like to talk to you
about that desk.

746
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:27,314
I've been back there
for 20 years.

747
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:29,888
I'll end up losing my eyesight.
It's not fair.

748
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:32,888
It's up to you to set things right.

749
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:41,064
Excuse me.

750
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:44,229
It's about this desk... and seniority.

751
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,737
If you could move back there...

752
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,875
You don't mind, do you?

753
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:51,476
You understand? Thank you.
