1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000


2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,074


3
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,780
All right, hold it!
Oh, sorry, lieutenant.

4
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,580
All right,
it's 2 a.m. in New Orleans,

5
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,420
The big easy.
And we're stirring up that gumbo!

6
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,100
Hey, Remy!
Hey, Teeneg, where you at?

7
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,980
Where you been,
don't you ever go home?

8
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,780
Only when the music stops, Cher.
Hey, who's the dead meat?

9
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,660
As long as you're here,
let's see if you can make him.

10
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,420
Oh man, yeah. Hello, Freddy.
That's Freddy Angelo, wise-guy scumbag,

11
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,180
Works for Eddie Di Moti.
He handles Mexican imports for the family.

12
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,980
Mama!
Can't find any bullet hits, spent shells,

13
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,900
Nothing like that?
very little blood.

14
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,740
We figure they lit him up some place
else, then brought his body here.

15
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,620
Here's his wallet.
They just lifted the prints.

16
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,540
Oh-huh!

17
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,420
Oh, the drivers license
is missing!

18
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,340
I guess they took it for
proof of their hit.

19
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,980
Standard wise-guy
procedure, right, Remy?

20
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,060
If you're gonna wrap
'em in a concrete overcoat

21
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,900
and dump 'em in
lake Pontchartrain.

22
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,700
But here's Freddy,
dead as Kelsey's nuts,

23
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,820
right in the middle
of the Piazza D'Italia.

24
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,340
Now what does that tell us, huh?

25
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,620
Somebody is sending a message.
To the esteemed president

26
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,540
of the Italian-American
Renaissance Association.

27
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,420
Vinnie "The Cannon" Di Moti.
There you go.

28
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,300
I want you to pick up
Vinnie "The Cannon"

29
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,140
tomorrow morning at his barbershop
and bring him in for questioning.

30
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,740
Hi, Remy.

31
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,620
Cavenaugh, where you at?
I'm doing it.

32
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,500
What is this, the Dodge and
De Soto Follies?

33
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,420
Who would know what
you're thinking about?

34
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,300
Captain, it was Andre's idea.

35
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,180
Is he the brains of
the partnership now?

36
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,020
Hey, what did they do now?
Impounded a boat.

37
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,940
They spent half their shift at
the damned police dock.

38
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,900
What am I going to
do with them?

39
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,060
Why don't we shoot 'em?
Yeah!

40
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,620
No, they're too much fun at Mardi Gras.
Who's that in my office?

41
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,460
Assistant district attorney,
Anne Osborne.

42
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,300
Hmmm, nice neck!
We have written orders to cooperate.

43
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,100
Her be part of the special task force
that's investigating police corruption.

44
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,980
Where did she get
that idea, huh?

45
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,860
She says she's here about
the Angelo murder.

46
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,780
So I'm gonna get myself
some real coffee,

47
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,700
and you're going to give her
whatever she needs.

48
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,620
She's in good hands, Cher.

49
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,260
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

50
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,220
Oh!

51
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,980
Anne, hi.
I'm Remy McSwain.

52
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,940
Oh!

53
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,860
Ouch!

54
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,740
Your pencil.

55
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,580
Lieutenant...
Ahhh, Remy.

56
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,420
Lieutenant, I came to find out what
progress you've made on the Angelo murder.

57
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,300
What's your hurry,
he's not even stiff yet.

58
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,140
He is dead though, isn't he?
Oh, last time I saw him, yeah.

59
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,980
You have no clues or leads?
Not so far.

60
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,900
See, I've seen dozens of
these wise-guy jobs.

61
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,780
We usually find out why
the hit went down or who did it,

62
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,660
But we never have enough
to take to court.

63
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,340
He wasn't at the barbershop,
so we picked him up at his home.

64
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,380
Bring him in.

65
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,260
Oh, thank you so much for
coming in, Mr. Di Moti.

66
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,140
This is Miss Anne Osborne of
the district attorney's office.

67
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,020
My lawyer is going to get me
out of here in five minutes.

68
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,860
I got nothing to say
'til then, nothing!

69
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,740
Why, you're not
under arrest, Mr. Di Moti.

70
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,660
Did McCabe give you
that impression?

71
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,540
McCabe, I want you to
apologize to Mr. Di Moti here.

72
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,380
I'm sorry about the
misunderstanding, Mr. Di Moti.

73
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,220
You're free to go any time you want, sir.
Again, we really do apologize.

74
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,100
Well...

75
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,980
We just wanted to express
our sympathy about Freddy.

76
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,820
About who? Freddy Angelo,
the guy they found floating

77
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,740
in the fountain last night
behind your office.

78
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,620
Yeah, he used to work
for me, terrible!

79
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,940
Nobody's got any respect
for monuments anymore.

80
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,900
Mr. Di Moti, isn't it true

81
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,100
that Mr. Angelo worked for you
for nearly 20 years,

82
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,900
and was still in your employ
at the time of his death?

83
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,020
Can I go?

84
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,820
You know, kid, your father would
never drag me down here.

85
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,740
If he wanted to see me,
he'd come to the house!

86
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,460
He knew a little something
about respect.

87
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,020
Get out of my way!

88
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,380
I can't believe you were so
obsequious with that man.

89
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,700
What does "obsequious" mean?

90
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,620
It means you had a high-ranking
member of the Mafia

91
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,500
in your office and
you kissed his ass.

92
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,340
Well, let me point
out a few things to you.

93
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,220
First of all, nobody
uses the word "Mafia" anymore.

94
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,100
Down here we call them "wise guys."
You're not from here, are you?

95
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,020
I only say this to save
you any kind of embarrassment.

96
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,900
I'll bear that in mind, lieutenant.

97
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,500
Anything else?

98
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,420
Hey, you like spicy food?
why don't we have dinner?

99
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,340
I know this little cajun place.

100
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,260
Relax, Romeo.

101
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,140
Tell me what you learned
from two minutes of ass-kissing.

102
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,020
Actually I learned a
lot from that little interview.

103
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,820
Do you read minds?

104
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,260
No, I read people, and
after seeing "The Cannon,"

105
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,140
I can probably tell you why
Freddy sprung a leak last night.

106
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,060
I suppose you know
who the killer is, too.

107
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,260
Oh no, but I bet we find his body
floating in the lake in a couple of weeks.

108
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,380
Then what will you do?
Nothing.

109
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,620
I told you we never
have enough to take to court.

110
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,060
Hell, I'd close the case
right now except for one thing.

111
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,620
What's that?
I'll tell you over dinner.

112
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,660
Hey, come on, we don't
have to stand in line.

113
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,780
Hey!
Hey, man!

114
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,020
How embarrassing.

115
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,580
That's what's great about being a cop.
How you doing?

116
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,740
Hey!
All right, Willie!

117
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,980
Come on, we're going
to work up an appetite.

118
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,540
Hi, Remy.

119
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,140
I thought we were
here to discuss business.

120
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,020
Business and pleasure,
what's wrong with that?

121
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,900
I can't do this.

122
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,220
Wait, didn't they
dance where you come from?

123
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,260
No, we barely spoke.

124
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,100
This is New Orleans, doll,
the big easy.

125
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,020
Down here dancing's
a way of life, come on.

126
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,620
Feel the music!

127
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,660
Now you're getting it, that's right!

128
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,820
You see
my grandpapa on my mama's side,

129
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,740
now he was a real cajun.

130
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,100
Born and died on the bayoutish.

131
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,020
I thought you came
from a family of Irish cops.

132
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,860
No, that was on my daddy's side.
He was the first one to become a cop.

133
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,740
Followed by three brothers,
one son and four nephews.

134
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,660
My cousin, Terry,
joined the fire department.

135
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,540
He's the black sheep of the family.

136
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,460
You were the youngest detective

137
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,340
in the history of the N.O.P.D.
to ever make lieutenant.

138
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,220
I had an in
in the department, sugar.

139
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,140
Careful who you say that to.

140
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,980
Oh yeah, that's right,
you bust cops... for a living.

141
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,820
I'm not embarrassed
to put bad cops behind bars.

142
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,100
Why don't you tell
me something about your life.

143
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,940
It's not as colorful as yours.
Oh yeah?

144
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,620
Do you want me to tell you

145
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,420
why I'm not closing the Angelo case?

146
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,180
That's supposed to be why I'm here.

147
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,660
It's you.
Oh please!

148
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,460
No, no, it's you really.

149
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,580
I mean, how come an
assistant district attorney

150
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,460
in an official corruption
strike force

151
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,340
is suddenly so interested
in a routine Mafia hit?

152
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,540
Routine "wise-guy" hit,
remember?

153
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,140
Yeah, whatever.
What gives?

154
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,060
We have the jurisdiction
to investigate any crime.

155
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,900
You got some kind of police
corruption angle on this case?

156
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,820
No comment, lieutenant.

157
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,700
You got any evidence at all?
No comment, again.

158
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,540
Hey, Remy, how's everything?
You like that gumbo?

159
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,420
Remy's great aunt Emeline,
she teach me my gumbo.

160
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,260
But she uses more sassafras
filet in her gumbo.

161
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,180
You watch your mouth, boy,
or you don't get no dessert.

162
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,060
We got Cajun Coush-Coush,
and we got Dobas Cake.

163
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,940
No, nothing for me, thanks.
I have to be up very early tomorrow.

164
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,860
Yeah, we just gonna
take the check tonight, Paul.

165
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,660
What you talking about, Cher?
I mean I want the check, Paul!

166
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,580
Remy done lost his mind.

167
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,460
He knows his money
is no good in here.

168
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,380
then just give me the check.

169
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,260
Paul, have you met Anne Osborne
with the D.A.'s office?

170
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,100
Oh, really?
You looking for that check, Remy.

171
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,060
Right here it is,
all the time.

172
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,860
You honestly don't
see the harm in any of this?

173
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,740
No, I don't see the harm,
these are the perks!

174
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,620
But the restaurant expects
extra protection in return.

175
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,500
Big deal!

176
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,380
And expect the officer
to overlook any code violations.

177
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,500
If all the codes
were enforced in this city,

178
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,180
you wouldn't have a single
restaurant that could stay open.

179
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,100
So now you're defending
organized corruption?

180
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,380
I'm not defending anything,
this is New Orleans.

181
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,860
Folks have a certain
way of doing things down here.

182
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,740
People like to show
their appreciation.

183
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,060
Really, how does it work?
Do you get free suits?

184
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,260
Do you get a little envelope
from Chef Paul every week?

185
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,100
Are you wearing a
wire in there or something?

186
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,980
I'm serious.
How far does all this stuff go?

187
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,500
Is everything for sale?

188
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,460
What's it cost to beat
a murder rap these days?

189
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,620
Is that what you think about cops?

190
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,300
You've got a real
serious attitude problem.

191
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,140
Being around you for
an evening hasn't improved it.

192
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,900
I've never seen a man break
so many laws in such a short time.

193
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,820
It's very simple when
you're out on the street.

194
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,740
There's "good guys"
and there's "bad guys".

195
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,660
I suppose you're the "good guys"?

196
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,540
Damn right, and we're all
that stands between you and them.

197
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,420
Why don't you just drop
me off at the corner up there.

198
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,980
And don't think that
I'm naive, lieutenant.

199
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,860
I know the way the system works,
but things can change.

200
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,780
Oh yeah, are you going
to change it?

201
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,020
Don't you dare
be amused at me.

202
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,580
Hey, is this your building?
No, I live up the street.

203
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,460
I have to get some things.
Is that okay?

204
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,340
I'll wait for you and
drive you the rest of the way.

205
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,260
No thank you,
I'd rather walk.

206
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,140
I'll walk with you.

207
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,980
No. Thank you very much for a
very illuminating evening.

208
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,860
Stop, my purse!

209
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,540
Ohhh!
Let's go, blood!

210
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,420
Help, somebody help!
Let me go, woman!

211
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,220
Police!

212
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,020
Don't screw up!

213
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,860
Scumbag, get your face down
on the pavement right now!

214
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,780
You stay down there
for a second.

215
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,500
Ah-ha, ah-ha.

216
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,380
You a cop?
Yes, ma'am.

217
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,260
Thank god you were here.
I just cashed my pay check.

218
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,060
Stay here and a patrolman will
be by to take your statement.

219
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,980
You think I'm crazy or what?

220
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,860
I'm not taking any chances,
no police!

221
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,420
All right.

222
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,860
A patrol car is going to come
for you in a little while.

223
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,900
Now if you do anything
to my car,

224
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,660
If you even get your
fingerprints on the paint,

225
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,220
they are going to beat
the ever-living shit out of you.

226
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,980
Do you fully understand each
and every one of these rights

227
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,860
as I have explained them to you?
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,460
It's a good thing
I'm such a pushy guy, huh?

229
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,020
Hey, Remy, listen to this.

230
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,900
Remember Mrs. Williams who
stabbed her husband last week?

231
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,780
We go see her, "Mrs. Williams,
your husband just died,"

232
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,660
"and you're busted for
second-degree homicide."

233
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,620
You know what she said?

234
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,420
"That bastard, I stabbed
him before and he never died."

235
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,300
Homicide, McSwain.
Hello, lieutenant.

236
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,180
Hey, Anne, you must be psychic.

237
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,060
I was just thinking about you.

238
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,940
What's new on the Angelo case?
Not a thing.

239
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,860
Why not, aren't you working on it?

240
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,740
Hey, I got a poisoned
nurse in the garden district

241
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,660
and a strangled transvestite
in the French Quarter.

242
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,580
I got a suspicious
asphyxiation in town.

243
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,460
Freddy Angelo has
to wait his turn.

244
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,380
I thought the Angelo case
was supposed to be given priority.

245
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,300
When can I see
a copy of your report?

246
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,140
I'll tell you what, the Nevelle Brothers
are playing at Tipitina's tonight.

247
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,940
I can give it to you then.
I was thinking that we ought to

248
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,820
keep this relationship
strictly professional.

249
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,780
Hey, why?

250
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,660
I thought we passed a good
time last night.

251
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,500
Didn't you like the music?
The music was very nice.

252
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,900
Didn't you like the crawfish etouffee?
The food was delicious,

253
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,980
but look, let's just forget
about last night.

254
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,940
There's too much possibility
for conflict of interest.

255
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,900
Oh, really?

256
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,700
Why, are you investigating me?
Of course not, no.

257
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,580
Why don't I pick you up at 8:00,
and don't be late?

258
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,420
No, please just have somebody send
a copy of the report to my office.

259
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,340
Thank you, lieutenant.

260
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,580
Hey, Annie!

261
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,500
What are you doing here?

262
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,300
Hey, what the hell you doing?

263
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,500
I got a large pizza here.
Pepperoni with extra cheese.

264
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,340
Move your goddamned car!

265
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,660
You can't get around me that easy.
Where's my report?

266
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,460
Right here.
Where?

267
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,260
Under the pizza. You got to eat
the pie to get to the report.

268
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,260
Go on, girlie,
get in the car!

269
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,180
You write a pretty good report.
Oh, great.

270
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,180
Does that mean we can
go to Tipitina's now?

271
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,100
No.

272
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,980
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

273
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,900
Now Angelo was shot
at a downward angle.

274
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,740
The weapon was a Mack-10 pistol.
Are you thinking dope smugglers?

275
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,620
Possibly, but a lot of
younger wise-guys

276
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,500
use Mack-10 pistols, too.

277
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,420
you found his car parked way out
on Choopatalis Street.

278
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,260
Chopatoolis Street.
Chopatoolis.

279
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,140
But you couldn't find any
evidence of a crime, correct?

280
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,060
Yeah, but what it doesn't
say in there is

281
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,940
that Freddy Angelo's car
was parked across the street

282
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,820
from a wharf warehouse owned
by Carmine Tandino,

283
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,740
a very well-known hit man
in the family

284
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,700
of our mutual friend,
Vinnie "The Cannon" Di Moti.

285
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,620
I'm going to check out
that warehouse tomorrow.

286
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,500
Why isn't that in your
report, lieutenant?

287
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,380
We're not supposed to draw
conclusions, you know that.

288
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,220
If someone were to ask you,
what conclusion would you draw?

289
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,980
Well, Freddy imported
heroin for a living.

290
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,860
Carmine Tandino's
warehouse is on the river.

291
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,660
Sometimes heroin comes up the river.
You draw your own conclusions.

292
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,820
What?
I'm impressed.

293
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,740
By what?

294
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,580
Well, you've obviously given
this a great deal of thought.

295
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,420
You're doing a really thorough job.
Oh, thank you very much.

296
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,780
What do you think, I do a very lousy job?
No, I didn't mean that.

297
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,980
Why don't you like me, Anne?
I do like you.

298
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,900
Well, why don't you trust me then?

299
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,860
Huh?

300
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,620
You think I'm a rotten,
don't-give-a-shit,

301
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,540
dishonest,

302
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,380
no-good, dirty cop.

303
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,180
Is that what you think of me?
No.

304
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,060
I do trust you.
I do.

305
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,820
Ouch!

306
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,660
Sorry.

307
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,620
I'm not very good at this.

308
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,060
Shhh!

309
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,180
I can't do this.

310
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,020
I'm too nervous.
I can't relax.

311
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,580
I'm very embarrassed.

312
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,460
Oh, no, don't be embarrassed.

313
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,300
Just relax, darling.

314
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,180
This is The Big Easy.

315
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,020
Folks have a certain
way of doing things down here.

316
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,940
I've noticed.

317
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,540
Oh, stop that!
Stop what?

318
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,180
That.

319
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,060
What?
That.

320
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,180
What, that, or that?

321
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,620
Yours or mine?

322
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,620
Mine.

323
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,540
Shit.

324
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,220
McSwain, this better be good!

325
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,740
What, slow down a minute. All
right, I'll be right there.

326
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,180
Shit!

327
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,900
What is it?

328
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,180
A triple murder in Storyville.

329
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,980
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
It's okay.

330
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,780
I never did have
much luck with sex anyway.

331
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,180
Your luck is about to change.

332
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,380
Oh boy, ooo-la-la!

333
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:00,020
How long does a murder take?
A couple of hours at least.

334
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,900
Come back.

335
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,580
You sure?
I'm sure.

336
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,060
We'll talk about
the Angelo case.

337
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,100
Sure!
Oh!

338
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,380
Hey, Hollywood, why don't
you call your mother on the phone.

339
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,300
She hadn't heard
from you in over a week.

340
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,140
Hey, when the hell you going
to make an honest woman of her?

341
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,060
She ain't going to
marry me until I retire.

342
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,980
Yeah, that'll be the day.

343
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,820
What, we got a carnival
going on here or what?

344
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,740
Hey, what the hell's going on?

345
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,500
There's a couple
of kids spreading a rumor

346
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,380
that the killers were
in an unmarked police car.

347
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,300
Great, that's all we need.

348
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,060
Don't be looking at us
'cause you all did it!

349
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,700
All right to roll him over,
lieutenant?

350
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,620
Yeah, roll away.

351
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,380
Whooo!
Jamaal Washington, huh?

352
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,100
Hey, Jack, everything
under control out there?

353
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,980
Oh yeah, the riot's
kind of turned into a party.

354
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,860
Oh man, I love this town.

355
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,620
You remember Miss Anne Osborne.
It's very nice to see you again.

356
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,420
Yeah, you too.
The D.A.'s office is interested

357
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,300
since there's an allegation
of police officer involvement.

358
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,220
You believe every
rumor you hear?

359
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,660
Do you have any evidence
one way or the other?

360
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,540
Right now we got two
unknown white male suspects,

361
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,380
not officers, suspects.
And one unsubstantiated rumor.

362
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,580
Anything on the victims yet?
Yeah.

363
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,260
You don't want to see this guy.
He kind of lost his face.

364
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,020
We have to wait for
a fingerprint I.D. on him.

365
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,940
The third victim I
think is a Nobliet brother,

366
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,820
also narcotics and
runner for Daddy Mention.

367
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,780
Who's Daddy Mention?

368
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,700
He handles the black side
of narcotics.

369
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,540
Vinnie "The Cannon", you met him the
other day, he's got the white action.

370
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,380
Anne.

371
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,260
Why don't you believe
the killers were cops?

372
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,420
If they were cops,
they would have stayed here.

373
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,060
When we arrived we would
have found plants: guns, knives,

374
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,980
all kinds of evidence
that they resisted arrest.

375
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,900
Something every cop
knows how to do.

376
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,820
Doesn't surprise me.

377
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,620
You probably know how to
bribe a jury too, don't you?

378
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,500
Even though you
probably never have, huh?

379
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,740
Hey, Remy, look what I got.

380
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,260
It feels like about a kilo.

381
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,180
That's great work,
Dodge, really great work.

382
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,100
Hey!

383
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,980
Why don't we pass it around
and all put our fingerprints on it?

384
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,780
What's this?
Heroin, Mexican brown.

385
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Somebody's been
using shotguns here, so...

386
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,540
I figure Tandino.

387
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,420
Carmine Tandino, hit man for
Vinnie "The Cannon."

388
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,300
Shotguns are his signature.

389
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,220
Resulting in spaghetti sauce.

390
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,940
Captain, you want to take over here.

391
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,820
I think I should take Miss Osborne home.
Oh, thank you very much.

392
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,540
Watch your step.

393
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,260
Don't they make a lovely couple.

394
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,020
Hey, we'll go to my apartment.
It's closer, all right?

395
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,940
Huh?

396
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,860
After a while you
get used to stuff like that.

397
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,740
You get hardened.

398
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,620
Everybody gets sick the first time.
Don't be embarrassed.

399
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,540
I'll be fine.

400
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,460
Let me know if you're going
to throw up, I'll pull over.

401
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,380
I'm not going to throw up.

402
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,100
You think Carmine Tandino killed
those men tonight, right?

403
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,660
Even with your head in the toilet
you still want to talk business?

404
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,900
Yeah, I think Carmine Tandino
killed those boys tonight.

405
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,340
Therefore, they must
have murdered Freddy Angelo.

406
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,340
I'd say you're right again.

407
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,940
What does that do to your
theory that the Angelo murder

408
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,940
was a message for Vinnie
"The Cannon" to retire?

409
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,900
Now we know who sent it,
Daddy Mention.

410
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,700
Now we're dealing with something more than
one wise guy killing another wise guy.

411
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,500
Well, we sure are.

412
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,540
What's that supposed to mean, huh?

413
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,580
Is Carmine Tandino the only person in the
world who uses a shotgun to kill people?

414
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,460
No, but he's one of the few
who turns a profit at it.

415
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,940
You don't think the cops
had anything to do with this?

416
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,940
Cops don't do that sort of thing.
Not even the rad cops.

417
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,100
You're always accusing
the cops of everything.

418
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,940
Okay, then how do you explain...
Hey, hey, hey,

419
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,860
How do you feel now, huh?

420
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,700
Does this stuff ever get to you?

421
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,540
Who me?
Bullets bounce off me.

422
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,300
You are never afraid?
All the time.

423
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,980
Look out for the gator, baby.

424
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,420
Ahhhh!

425
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,700
Oh shit, who are you?

426
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm Bobbie, Remy's brother.
You scared the hell out of me!

427
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,820
Where did you come from?
I spent the night here on the couch.

428
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Oh my god, excuse me.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

429
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,980
Hey, I just went down
to get us some breakfast.

430
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,780
I'm sorry, I'm really late for a meeting.
I have to get to work.

431
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,660
Hey, I'll drive you down there.
It's okay, I'll take a cab.

432
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,540
Did you meet my brother?
Kind of.

433
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,460
Hey, sugar, is something wrong?

434
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,860
What's for breakfast?
Your ass!

435
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,460
Jesus Christ, Remy,
you scared the shit out of me!

436
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,300
Don't just walk into an interrogation
room without knocking, man!

437
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,220
Where are the Storyville witnesses?

438
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,900
Hi. I heard you dudes saw
something last night in Storyville

439
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,300
around the time those
three guys got stovepiped.

440
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,700
They said you saw
an unmarked police car.

441
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,100
What are you talking about ?
We was home watching TV.

442
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,460
We didn't see nothing.

443
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,340
Andre, take their statements,
then let them go home.

444
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,220
You be nice to Andre.
That's "we didn't see nothing."

445
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,620
"We was home watching TV."
Is that right, gents?

446
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,300
Get me out of here!
I hate this job!

447
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,140
Property's a dirty job, Dewey.
You're next in line.

448
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,020
Remy, remember the guy
who lost his face last night?

449
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,940
Look what the morgue
guys found in his pocket.

450
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,860
Ah, Freddy Angelo's drivers license.

451
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,700
Beautiful, I knew those guys
killed Freddy. All right.

452
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,620
And what time did he leave?

453
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,540
You're sure?

454
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,380
Bop-bop-a-do-bop-bop.

455
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,300
Carmine Tandino
has an airtight alibi.

456
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,020
He was at Moscos with his wife
and half his family until four a.m.

457
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,500
I've got 12 witnesses
who corroborate his story.

458
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,980
You know who owns Moscos?
Carmine Tandino's nephew.

459
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,540
It's a very popular spot for alibis.
I'm going to talk to Carmine myself.

460
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,460
Remy, I got Anne Osborne on line.

461
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,020
Do you want me to
tell her you're not here?

462
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,260
No, I'll take it myself.

463
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,140
I can tell her you're not here.
No, really, I'll take it.

464
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,940
Miss Osborne,
I haven't got the forensics

465
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,740
or the ballistics report back yet, so...
I didn't call about that.

466
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,900
Look, Remy, I'm very
sorry about this morning,

467
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,780
about the way
I just ran out like that.

468
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,980
Me too.
I'm sort of confused.

469
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,860
Oh no, don't be confused, no.

470
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,700
Things like last
night don't happen to me.

471
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,620
Me either.

472
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,460
Oh, please.
No, I mean it, I really do.

473
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,340
I know too much about
your reputation to believe you.

474
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,220
God!

475
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,980
You want to get out
of my office, huh?

476
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,580
Anne Osborne.

477
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,460
Look, I'm going to take
you to lunch.

478
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,620
You look into my eyes and tell me
whether you believe me or not.

479
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,700
No, I can't.

480
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,140
Oh, great, then I'm going to make us a
reservation for Antoine's for one o'clock.

481
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,700
What did she want?
Who, Anne?

482
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,540
"Anne" he calls her. She's got
everybody around here scared shitless,

483
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,420
and he calls her
"Anne" for Christ's sakes!

484
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,340
I think that woman
is using the Angelo murder

485
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,260
as an excuse to come
sniffing around our widows...

486
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,180
Shhh!

487
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,020
Widows and orphans fund.
Why don't you relax, son.

488
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,940
Remy's got the lady
wrapped around his finger.

489
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,860
Which reminds me,
what's the beef?

490
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,740
I got a call from the
Sho-bar on Bourbon Street.

491
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,580
There's a new owner in there.

492
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,060
He's having some trouble,
and he wants to talk to you.

493
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,300
I got laryngitis.
He's got this thing about rank.

494
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,220
He don't talk to
no sergeant or flat foot.

495
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,060
Hey, hey,
don't you look at me, Lou.

496
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,980
I got to go
talk to Carmine Tandino.

497
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,900
Oh, come on,
for the widows and orphans.

498
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,740
It will take you five minutes.
It's on your way.

499
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,620
All right, dude, but you
owe me one, huh? Oh!

500
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,460
Watch out, loose ball.
Ohhh!

501
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,380
Oh, you!
That's 200 bucks.

502
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,260
I'm looking for George Joel.
You got him.

503
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,140
I think your mother
is calling you down there.

504
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,060
I heard you wanted
to talk to somebody.

505
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,860
I wanted to see the captain.
Hey, wait a minute, please.

506
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,780
Come back!
I didn't mean to offend you.

507
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,700
I got a different cop in here
every night shaking me down.

508
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,620
I can't stay in business
like that.

509
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,540
You got cops in here
bothering you?

510
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,460
Why don't you just send
them to me?

511
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,340
Don't get me wrong,
I'll pay, one guy, once a month,

512
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,220
not have cops jumping all over me.

513
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,100
Settle down, all right,
I'll take care of it.

514
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,020
I'll give you a number
you can call anytime, okay.

515
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,900
I knew you were
the right guy to talk to.

516
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,700
What's this?
It's my way of saying thanks.

517
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,420
You wearing a wire?
Help, help!

518
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:17,180
Hold it, freeze!
Get down!

519
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,060
Internal Affairs, hold it!

520
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,620
What's he chewing?
Spit it out!

521
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,420
Chew all you want, asshole.
We've got everything on video tape.

522
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,100
Miss Osborne,
a telephone call.

523
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,820
Jesus, can't I leave
the office for an hour?

524
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,700
What?

525
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,460
I'm sorry, what?

526
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,180
Step up.
Hold it, hold it.

527
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,060
I got to talk with this man.
Cut him loose here.

528
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,980
What's the special treatment?

529
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,860
Come on, man!
Yeah, he's a cop.

530
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,620
What the hell happened?
They set a trap, and I got caught.

531
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,540
The thing that Dodge
was talking about?

532
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,380
That was supposed to be me.
I can handle it.

533
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,820
I got Lamar Parmentel to defend you.

534
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,340
Lamar?

535
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,820
I know, he's beat your brains a thousand
times, but he knows what he's doing.

536
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,540
The guys have agreed the widows and
orphans fund is paying his fees.

537
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,380
You want to keep
your voice down, Jack, man.

538
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,980
Thanks.

539
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,300
Make room and be quiet.
Remy.

540
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,980
We take care of our
own, remember that.

541
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,820
I'm going to take care of it.

542
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,700
I'll give you a number
you can call anytime.

543
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,620
We got the bribery
conviction locked up.

544
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,540
I don't know, it skirts
the edge of entrapment.

545
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,460
If we get the wrong judge,
he'll throw the case out.

546
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,340
Maybe he'll want to make a deal.

547
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,220
I don't think we
should offer a deal now.

548
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,140
We should get a conviction,
then we can offer a deal.

549
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,060
Anne, I want you
to ask for very high bail.

550
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,940
Let him sweat a little.
Help, help!

551
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,940
All rise.

552
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,740
These are the custodies?
Be seated.

553
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,500
Okay, what have we got?
Tibido.

554
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,340
There are two Tibidos, your honor.
Unrelated cases.

555
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,220
All right, sit down,
we'll get back to both of you.

556
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,140
You! you look familiar.

557
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,900
Well, I'm certainly sorry
to see you before me, lieutenant.

558
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,780
Extortion, bribery.
Do you have counsel?

559
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:15,580
I'm his counsel, your honor.
We waive rights and plead not guilty.

560
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,380
We petition the court for the earliest
possible date for a preliminary hearing.

561
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,180
Now, the 22nd is
the earliest date I've got.

562
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,060
Your honor, everyday my
client is suspended from the force

563
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,980
does great damage to his reputation,

564
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,420
As well as to the on-going
investigations he's conducting.

565
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:33,780
All right.

566
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,660
We can get you in day after
tomorrow before Judge Garrison,

567
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,500
If that's all right with the state?
We're ready, your honor.

568
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,380
Your honor, giving
due weight to the seriousness

569
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,260
of the charges against
a public official,

570
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,140
the state asks for bail
in the amount of $50,000.

571
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,020
Your honor, the defendant
has been a police officer

572
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,900
for 11 years and has very
strong ties to the community.

573
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,780
Bail is set at $500.

574
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,460
All right, Tibido, Andrew.

575
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,340
That girl is after your ass.

576
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,260
Why don't you let me try
to make a deal.

577
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,140
What kind of a deal?

578
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,060
Plead you guilty to unlawful
acceptance of a gratuity.

579
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,660
Is that a misdemeanor?

580
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,700
A felony, you'll get
maybe three months jail time.

581
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,020
One felony conviction
and I'm off the job.

582
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,140
What kind of a life is that?

583
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,380
I'm a cop,
it's all I know how to do.

584
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,420
Remy, Remy,
they've got a video tape.

585
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,260
Did you ever see
a jury watch a video tape?

586
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,180
It's like watching
Mike Wallace on "60 minutes."

587
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,020
Lamar, I can't go to jail.

588
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,500
Can I help you?

589
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,340
Yeah, I called about...
a nickel magnet.

590
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,260
Yeah, I got it right here.

591
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,180
You're not wearing
a quartz watch, are you?

592
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,060
What?
It's a powerful magnet.

593
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,980
If you're wearing a
quartz watch it will ruin it.

594
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,860
I ain't got no time for no watch.
Good, 183.

595
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,780
Yeah, I know.

596
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,940
Hey, brother.
Hey, what's the matter?

597
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,820
Don't you recognize
your own brother, brother?

598
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,740
Jesus, Remy!

599
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,580
You know Mardi Gras
ain't till February.

600
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,420
What are you doing in that get up?
Oh, a little undercover work.

601
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,300
I thought you were suspended.

602
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,140
Who told you that?
Mama.

603
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,940
She said you were framed.

604
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,820
Look, this is hard as hell
for me to explain to you.

605
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,700
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

606
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,620
Look, I want to be honest
with you.

607
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,940
In this particular case,

608
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,260
It was a setup.
But, I've been on the take

609
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:35,020
in little-bitty ways since practically
the first day on the job.

610
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,860
I know that.
Oh, yeah?

611
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,660
Who told you?
What do you think, I'm stupid?

612
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,540
Nobody had to tell me.

613
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,420
I know you give mama
the money for my tuition.

614
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,300
It sure don't
come out of your salary.

615
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,060
I'm just glad I can
finally thank you.

616
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,900
I didn't want you
to know about that.

617
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,580
I remember once,
I must have been about six or seven,

618
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,340
I was looking in daddy's
pocket for a candy bar,

619
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,180
and I found seven to eight
$10 dollar bills.

620
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,060
You knew about daddy?

621
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,980
Yeah, I knew about
daddy and all the relatives.

622
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,860
I just...
I figured it was understood.

623
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,700
I didn't understand it.
What?

624
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,460
I didn't have any
idea daddy was on the take

625
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,140
until I was on the job myself.
Are you serious?

626
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,220
You were eight years old when daddy died.
I should have asked you.

627
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,620
It's not too late.
Want to ask me anything else?

628
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,900
Sex?
Drugs?

629
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,700
Have you been having sex?

630
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,380
Don't you want to introduce
your mama to your lawyer, son?

631
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,300
Mama, this is Lamar Parmentel.

632
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,180
Ah, the renowned
queen of the McSwain Clan.

633
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,020
How delightful to finally
meet you in the flesh.

634
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:08,980
I know all about you, Lamar.

635
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,860
You're the man that
got the governor acquitted.

636
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,780
I know you're going to to
do a fine job defending my Remy.

637
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,700
Yeah, mama, yeah.

638
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,540
Of course, you know about his outstanding
record and the citations they gave him?

639
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,460
Did he ever tell you
about saving the drowning boy?

640
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,300
The baby was in the water.
Hey, where you at?

641
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,100
Who is that?
That's the prosecuting attorney, mama.

642
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,980
Yeah, ain't she cute?
Oh, yeah.

643
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,900
Oye, oye, oye,
criminal district court,

644
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,780
section 8, city of New Orleans,
is now in session.

645
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,660
The Honorable Jim Garrison presiding.
What occurred next?

646
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,540
I saw George Joel hand
the defendant the white envelope.

647
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,460
I saw it very clearly.

648
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,300
And what did the defendant do?
He accepted the envelope.

649
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,140
And from the balcony
you weren't able

650
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,020
to hear the conversation
between this George Joel

651
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,580
and the defendant,
isn't that the case?

652
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,740
Yes, sir.

653
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,780
You testified there were eight
$50 bills in the envelope?

654
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,540
That's correct.
Can you produce this money in court?

655
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,340
Sir, the defendant dropped the money
in the center of the crowded bar.

656
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,260
It was clear the people
in the bar took it,

657
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,180
but we just couldn't search
everybody that was there.

658
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,140
Thank you.

659
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,820
Mr. Joel,
did the defendant promise

660
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,420
that these uniformed officers
would stop harassing you?

661
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,460
Yeah, if I'd pay him,
he would.

662
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,500
What would happen if you did
not make this payment?

663
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,420
If I don't pay,
the police close me down.

664
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,340
Oh!

665
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,180
Have you ever been arrested?

666
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,060
The prosecution stipulates the witness
is currently under indictment.

667
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,900
I'm sure I don't have to remind
the court that clergymen

668
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,780
and bankers are seldom
witnesses at criminal trials.

669
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,580
Is it not true that you would say
anything the prosecution wanted

670
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,500
to avoid being sent to prison?

671
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,420
Yeah.
Objection!

672
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,340
I mean no.
Sustained.

673
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,980
Lieutenant, you said you went
to the tavern to see an informer?

674
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,940
Yes, ma'am.

675
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,780
Now if you were engaged in
your duties as a police officer,

676
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,660
why did you run away from
the Internal Affairs officer?

677
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,580
He did not identify
himself as a police officer.

678
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,500
I thought he was a mugger.

679
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:22,620
Were you armed?
Yes, ma'am.

680
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,180
And you ran away from a mugger?

681
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,460
I was calling for assistance,
which is proper police procedure.

682
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,980
Was it also proper police procedure

683
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,860
to chew and swallow the envelope
that Mr. Joel gave to you?

684
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,820
What envelope?

685
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,700
Lieutenant, earlier today
officer Crinky swore under oath

686
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,580
that he saw you accept
an envelope from Mr. Joel.

687
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,500
Were you here for that testimony?

688
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,460
Yes, ma'am.

689
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,300
Are you calling your fellow
officer a liar, lieutenant?

690
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,180
No, I just don't know what
envelope you're talking about.

691
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:53,820
The envelope Mr. Joel gave
you containing eight $50 bills.

692
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,860
Objection, your honor.
Counsel is drawing conclusions.

693
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,820
Sustained.

694
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,660
The $50 bills you threw in the air,
the envelope you ate!

695
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,580
Objection!
Sustained.

696
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,300
I have no further questions.
The witness may step down.

697
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,860
Your honor, tomorrow the prosecution
will present a video tape

698
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,260
that will not only corroborate
every state's witness,

699
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,620
but will refute every statement
the defendant has made.

700
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,500
And show that in addition
to the crime charged,

701
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,340
the defendant has per jured
himself before this court.

702
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,060
This court is adjourned until
10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

703
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,700
It's 3:00 in the morning.

704
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,620
Yes, but this is McCabe,
sorry to bother you.

705
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,500
But somebody just blew
up Carmine Tandino's warehouse,

706
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,420
With him in it.
No kidding!

707
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,300
There's another body too,
nobody knows him.

708
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,220
Maybe you can make him.
I'll be right down.

709
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,140
I don't think
you better come down here.

710
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,020
Deputy Soup is talking
to the TV guys.

711
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,860
Film at 11:00, huh?
Meet us at the morgue in an hour.

712
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,780
Hey, it's a free country,
isn't it?

713
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,700
I'll meet you at
the scene in 15 minutes.

714
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,300
Anne Osborne.

715
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,180
Carmine Tandino was
just killed at his warehouse

716
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,980
down on the Third Street wharf. I
thought you would want to know.

717
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:08,220
Hey, Remy.
Pssst, come here, come here.

718
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,140
Oh, Remy, I told you not to come.

719
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,980
I'm not here. Where are the bods?
This way.

720
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,860
It looks like the killer
set a fire to destroy the bodies.

721
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,020
The fire explodes a drum of paint thinner,
and the explosion blows out the fire.

722
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,540
How did you identify Tandino?

723
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,420
Oh, yeah,
he had a glass eye, way to go!

724
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,300
Ain't that a beautiful shooter.

725
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,180
This is the guy we can't make.

726
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,100
He must have been hiding
here when they killed Tandino.

727
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,020
Oh god!

728
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,780
Hey, I know him,
that's Tandino's older brother.

729
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,620
I didn't know he had a brother.
Yeah, the poor guy's retarded.

730
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,500
The family kept him at home.

731
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,420
He did a little work
sweeping up the warehouse.

732
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,220
Oh man, now they're killing retards.
Then why ain't you dead?

733
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:00,980
This is where they work up--
watch your step!

734
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,820
...the Mardi Gras stuff
and all that.

735
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,820
Some of these...

736
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,740
Hold it.

737
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,580
You okay?
Who does this remind you of?

738
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,500
That's for the World's Fair.

739
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,380
They got about 10
or 12 pieces of the thing.

740
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,260
Let me show you this one
cause when I was a kid we used...

741
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,180
Wait, hey!

742
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:26,900
Miss Osborne, are you sure
that you want to see this?

743
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,740
What the hell is this
man doing here?

744
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,660
What the hell is this man
doing here?

745
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,500
Better yet, what are you doing here?

746
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,380
Yeah, what are you doing here?

747
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,140
I got an anonymous call.
Anne.

748
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,820
They ripped the heart
right out of his chest.

749
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,780
Why would they do a
thing like that?

750
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,700
Voodoo.
Daddy Mention.

751
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,540
The heroin dealer?
And voodoo priest.

752
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,460
That's Daddy Mention's thing.

753
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,380
Yeah, the heart of
your enemy makes you strong.

754
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:07,140
So, what you're saying is that Daddy
Mention killed Carmine Tandino?

755
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,060
Supporting your theory that Tandino

756
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,980
murdered Daddy Mention's
men the other night.

757
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,900
What we got here
is a cute little drug war.

758
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:17,700
Doesn't satisfy you, Miss Osborne?
Not particularly, no.

759
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,340
I'll see you in
court tomorrow, McSwain.

760
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,300
That's a woman for you,
Jack, never satisfied.

761
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,900
Order in the court.
All remain seated.

762
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,620
What's her problem?

763
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,780
It seems her key piece of evidence
was erased when a powerful magnet

764
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,500
was placed beside it
in the police property room.

765
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,020
Really?
What, the video tape?

766
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,580
Unusable?

767
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,300
New Orleans is a marvelous
environment for coincidence.

768
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,580
Your honor, because
the key piece of evidence

769
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,460
has been suspiciously tampered with,

770
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,300
the state is compelled to drop its
charges against Lieutenant McSwain.

771
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,100
The defendant is ordered
released and bond is vacated.

772
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,940
Court is adjourned.

773
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,860
All right!

774
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,660
Great job!

775
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,300
Lamar, Lamar.

776
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,060
Wonderful!

777
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,460
I told you I'd get him off.

778
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,540
Miss Osborne.
Yes.

779
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,420
Would you come with me, please.
What, where?

780
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,220
I really can't tell you right now.
Is this supposed to be a joke?

781
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,060
No, it's no joke, my friend.
Well, am I under arrest?

782
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,980
What are the charges?

783
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,820
Well, you were jaywalking
over there,

784
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,700
and when you ran across the bridge,
that's trespassing.

785
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,420
And that I'm going
to call resisting arrest.

786
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,300
You don't happen to be a relative
of Remy McSwain's by any chance?

787
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,140
Look, Cher,
listen to your uncle Solse,

788
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,980
put your pretty face in the car.
I thought so.

789
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,780
Whooo!

790
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,620
Do these cajuns know
how to throw a party or what?

791
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,500
Yeah.

792
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,420
Listen all, I want to be
serious with you for a minute.

793
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,300
Most of you all know that
a policeman's life

794
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,180
is made up of short pay,
long hours, mortal danger

795
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,060
and very little thanks
from the public which we serve.

796
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,980
Every once in a while,
we win one.

797
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,860
Every once in a while
justice triumphs!

798
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,780
Remy, come here!

799
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,580
I want you to raise your cup or your
glass, raise your nose if you have to.

800
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:18,420
I give you the police department
of the city of New Orleans.

801
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,340
And the fire department.
Yeah!

802
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,140
Okay, the fire department too.
Hey, get some of this food over here.

803
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,060
We done burned 10 chickens,
I don't know what all.

804
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,980
Come on, let's party.

805
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,700
Now you're adding kidnapping and
false arrest to your list of crimes?

806
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,660
You're not under arrest.

807
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,420
Did Uncle Solse give you that impression?
Uncle Solse, apologize.

808
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,340
I'm sorry for that little
misunderstanding.

809
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,260
I suppose now you're going to
tell me I'm free to go.

810
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,180
You're free to go any
time you want.

811
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,100
Where is the telephone?

812
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,980
Up on the porch, I'll show you.
I'll get it myself.

813
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:55,780
Oh, that pretty girl's got a mad on.
Hey, look at this.

814
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:00,580
Where is she coming from?
She got some nerve!

815
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,500
Hey, Anne, I thought you were
great in court today.

816
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,380
I want to be a lawyer too.
I lost!

817
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,180
What the hell is she doing here?
A pushy broad, I told you.

818
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,980
Hey, look at this.

819
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:19,380
Yeah, she don't look bad in shorts, no.
When can you be here?

820
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,100
Fine.

821
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:29,380
You were saying some pretty hard things
about my boy in that courtroom today.

822
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,260
Yes, I did.
He's a good boy.

823
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,140
He could be a lot better,
Mrs. McSwain.

824
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,020
Are you gonna help him with that?

825
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,780
You got your work
cut out for you.

826
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,620
What did he do, drag you out
of the bathtub, or what?

827
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,420
No, I was running.
Running?

828
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,980
Dance with me,
come on dance with me.

829
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,260
No.

830
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,460
I cut a hell of a rug,
you know.

831
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,820
Come on.
Take your hand off me.

832
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:07,220
Come on, dance with the boy.
Dance with him.

833
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,500
Aren't you gonna look at me?

834
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:04,460
Are you satisfied?
Are you still mad at me, huh?

835
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,540
You don't get it,
do you?

836
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,940
You're a cop, you're supposed
to uphold the law.

837
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,820
But instead you bend it and twist it
and sell it. I saw you take that bribe

838
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,660
and resist arrest and
per jure yourself under oath.

839
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,540
Don't forget I ran
a red light too.

840
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:25,340
You still think it's funny, don't you.
Why don't you face it, Remy,

841
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,140
you're not one of
the good guys anymore.

842
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,980
Remy, good to see you back.
Hey, dudes.

843
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,940
I want you to do me a favor.
Sure, Remy, anything you need.

844
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,020
Take me off
the widows and orphans fund.

845
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,900
Jesus Christ, Remy,
what do you mean?

846
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,380
I don't mean nothing,
just take me off.

847
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,260
The widows and orphans
will do just fine without me.

848
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,900
Hey, don't even think about it.

849
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,844
Remy, look at this.
What's this?

850
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,645
Retirement papers, you finally did it.
As of December 31,

851
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,540
you're the ranking officer
of the homicide bureau.

852
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,420
The fight is yours, baby.
I don't believe you.

853
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,340
Your mother didn't
believe it either.

854
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,260
Are you finally
gonna marry the girl?

855
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,220
New Year's day.

856
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,140
I'd be honored if
you'd be my best man.

857
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,940
You bet I would,
you little huggy bear, you.

858
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,260
Bye, daddy.

859
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,860
What's so funny?
Come here.

860
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,740
Dodge, De Soto, McCabe,
Foster, in my office.

861
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,780
Welcome back, Remy.

862
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:19,540
Foster has an interesting angle
on the Freddy Angelo murder.

863
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,420
Second division pulled two floaters
out of the canal last night.

864
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:25,220
They turned out to be
mexican deep sea fisherman.

865
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,140
Suffering from an acute
case of lead poisoning.

866
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,020
They worked out of Vera Cruz
with long records of smuggling.

867
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,940
What's this got
to do with Freddy Angelo?

868
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,780
It turns out mexican customs had
a wire tap on both of these guys.

869
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,700
And guess who their last
phone was from?

870
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,580
Freddy Angelo.
That's right.

871
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,460
We know Freddy Angelo was in Vera Cruz
three days before he was killed.

872
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,340
Narcotics said that Freddy never dealt
with anything less than 20 or 30 kilos.

873
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,260
That can explain a gang war.

874
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,180
One kilo of heroin
always seemed kind of small time

875
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,100
for all these people
to get killed over.

876
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:55,940
But 20 or 30,
that makes a lot more sense.

877
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:59,780
Where's the rest of it, huh?
Did anybody talk to Daddy Mention?

878
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,260
What is he gonna tell us?

879
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,340
"Come on in, fellas,"
"it's in the back under the sink."

880
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,260
Come on.
Hello in there.

881
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,220
Hey, don't!

882
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,100
It's not what he says,
it's what you hear, Einstein.

883
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,740
Daddy Mention's the number one
suspect in a string of murders,

884
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,780
and you don't even talk to the guy.
We all know it's a gang war.

885
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,660
Daddy Mention is trying
to move in on Vinnie's action.

886
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,580
That sounds neat,
but I don't buy it no more.

887
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:31,420
Why not, it works for me.
Anne Osborne.

888
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,340
What the hell
does she know about it?

889
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,260
I don't know what she knows about it,
but she knows something,

890
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,180
which is a lot more than you guys.

891
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,100
You haven't done
shit since I've been gone.

892
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,020
They're doing our job for us.

893
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,940
One creep kills another creep,
that's one less to worry about.

894
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,780
Why not let them wipe each other out?
Because we're the police.

895
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:49,660
We've got guns and we're
supposed to be the good guys.

896
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,820
I'm going to talk
to Daddy Mention myself.

897
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,700
All those dinners with Osborne and
you still don't know what she knows.

898
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,300
Remy, you're losing your touch.

899
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,980
You should become
a defense lawyer, my dear.

900
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,820
You meet more colorful people.
You're going to love Daddy Mention.

901
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,620
He's a doctor of roots,
fruits and snoots.

902
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,500
You don't have any scruples at all,
do you, Lamar.

903
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,580
Is there anybody that
you wouldn't represent?

904
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:27,180
Darling, every man is entitled to
the best defense money can buy.

905
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,860
Oh, there you are.
I thought I lost you.

906
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:45,620
Why does Daddy Mention want to see me?
Actually, it was my idea.

907
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,500
I thought you might be interested
in what he had to say

908
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,420
about the rash of
killings we've had of late.

909
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,300
I know you've been looking
into one or two of them.

910
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,820
Daddy's expecting us.

911
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,100
Daddy, this is the young
woman I was talking about.

912
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:22,580
Well, well, well.
Anne Osborne, Daddy Mention.

913
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,580
How do you do, Mr. Daddy
...Mention.

914
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,100
Excuse my left-hand.
Are they all yours?

915
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,980
21 children and 14 grandchildren.

916
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,860
I got lost in one of those

917
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,740
bible verses that says,
"be fruitful and multiply."

918
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,660
I didn't read any further.

919
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:41,500
You kids run out, Daddy's
gonna talk some business.

920
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:45,340
You're a very lovely lady.
Thank you very much.

921
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,260
But let's get down
to business, shall we.

922
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:51,140
Mr. Parmentel tells me you're looking
into the murder of them Italian boys.

923
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,980
Carmine Tandino and Freddy Angelo,

924
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,860
as well as Jamaal Washington
and Michael and Darnel Nobliet.

925
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,780
All of them allegedly
worked for you.

926
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,700
That's what I want to
talk to you about.

927
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:05,500
The police are putting out this story
that there is a gang war going on.

928
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,380
Do you believe that?
What do you believe?

929
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,220
My people didn't kill no Freddy
Angelo or what's his name Tandino

930
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,060
and cut his heart out.

931
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,940
Then who did?
I don't know.

932
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,780
But I know they're killing my people too.
Why didn't you go to the police with this?

933
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:26,580
Daddy's had some unfortunate
experiences talking with the police.

934
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:30,420
There's a policeman to see you, Daddy.
Give me a minute.

935
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,180
Thanks.
Lamar.

936
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:39,060
I didn't know you
represented this sleazebag.

937
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,940
I only represent sleazebags, my boy.

938
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,860
What the hell are you doing here?

939
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,780
I came by to talk to "Chubby."

940
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:48,660
I don't know that
he wants to talk to you.

941
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,580
I didn't know the
two of you were like that.

942
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,500
There are a lot of things
about me that you don't know.

943
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:00,180
Stay here!
Out here!

944
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,020
Daddy's been shot!
No, no!

945
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:53,940
Ahh!

946
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,500
What's the big secret, Anne?
And don't you bullshit me, now.

947
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:29,380
What evidence do you got on
the Freddy Angelo murder, huh?

948
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:32,260
So you're beginning
to think cops were involved?

949
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,380
Yeah.
Why?

950
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,420
That was an unmarked police car.
It's a piece of shit four-door.

951
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,860
Besides, only cops drive like that.
What do you know?

952
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,700
We have an eyewitness who saw
two men in an unmarked police car

953
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,580
dump Freddy Angelo's body
into the Piazza D'Italia.

954
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,860
Why did they think it
was an unmarked police car?

955
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,100
They saw a blue light and
a radio in the front seat.

956
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,260
Why did you withhold this
information from the police?

957
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,180
The police are the suspects.

958
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:16,380
Hey, get back.
Out of the street.

959
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,100
There isn't no gang war...

960
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,420
Is there?

961
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:32,700
So what are you gonna do about it?

962
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:36,420
I don't know.
The police department is my family.

963
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,380
These people are killers, Remy.

964
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:45,980
What do you want me to do, go
undercover in my own precinct house?

965
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,380
No, I have a better idea.

966
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,220
Come on.

967
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,180
Anne, this is my cousin
Frank, Uncle Earnest.

968
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,620
you remember Uncle Solse,
cousin Pete.

969
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,860
Guys, thanks for helping out.

970
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,740
Uncle Solse, I want you to check
everybody coming in or out,

971
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,620
no matter who they are.
You got it, Remy.

972
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,500
Remy, what's going on?
Ask her.

973
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,260
Are you the
desk sergeant on duty?

974
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:33,100
Do I look like the king of Mardi Gras?
Then this is for you.

975
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,860
What the hell.
Hey, captain.

976
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,740
There's some broad
here with a search warrant.

977
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,460
Do you believe this shit?

978
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,140
Anybody who does not cooperate fully
and cheerfully with this investigation

979
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:59,020
will wish his mother
and father never met.

980
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,940
Was your car damaged?
It was in the lot for two days.

981
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,820
What was the nature
of the damage?

982
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:09,500
If you told me about this,
we could have sent out invitations.

983
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,420
Is that car 17?
Right.

984
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,340
What district?
Seven.

985
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,340
Sorry, boys, I've got orders
to pat everybody down.

986
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,140
Take out your weapons.

987
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,060
This lawyer is leading
Remy around by his nose.

988
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,980
Try his dick.
Higher, Solse.

989
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:28,180
Don't you touch me, you dirty old man.
Everything.

990
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,540
Andre's afraid of the dark.

991
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,300
Dark my ass,
it's a jungle out there.

992
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,220
If that don't work,
I piss on them.

993
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:46,940
There it is, right there. No,
those are junkers over there.

994
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,220
That baby hasn't been out
of here in three months.

995
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,100
Not a bad shot.
Thanks.

996
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,580
I want this car dusted
for fingerprints.

997
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,740
You'll find mine
all over the hood.

998
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:03,380
Are you gonna come over
and clean up by my house?

999
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,900
You're gonna pay for this, bitch.

1000
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,820
Eat or work?
Work.

1001
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,420
My place or yours?
Yours.

1002
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,100
That way I can leave
any time I want.

1003
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:43,860
Did you find something? You
look a little strange.

1004
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,700
No, just fried oysters
at 1:00 o'clock in the morning.

1005
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,540
Why don't we just
call it a night, huh.

1006
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:01,060
Who are you calling?
A cab.

1007
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,900
Why don't you just stay here.
I'll sleep on the couch.

1008
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:09,060
Thanks any way.
Oh, now. Wait a minute.

1009
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,540
You're gonna be over here
first thing in the morning.

1010
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:20,100
Hey, I won't try
no "cha-cha," I promise.

1011
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:22,940
The bed is yours, huh.

1012
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:26,020
No thank you,
but I'd rather go home.

1013
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,700
Oh, Annie.

1014
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:31,860
Are you gonna be pissed off at me
for the rest of your life?

1015
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,580
Maybe.

1016
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,220
Hey, can I get you anything?

1017
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:43,060
No thanks, I'll be asleep as soon
as my head hits the pillow.

1018
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:52,140
If I can't have you...
can I have my gator?

1019
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,060
Freeze!

1020
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,420
What is this,
"let's scare Bobby week?"

1021
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,580
You're gonna give me
a heart attack before I'm 21.

1022
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,660
Shhh, Anne is sleeping
in the bedroom, be quiet.

1023
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,380
And you're sleeping on the couch?

1024
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:02,380
Yeah, what about it.
Where am I supposed to sleep?

1025
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,740
I thought you college boys
like sleeping on the floor.

1026
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,940
Yeah, well, we don't.

1027
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:54,580
Good morning.
Morning.

1028
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,660
Hey Remy,
is the coffee ready yet?

1029
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:00,540
We're all out of coffee.
Why don't you go get some coffee.

1030
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,860
But it's pouring.
Take my raincoat.

1031
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,620
I don't have any money.
Here's some money for you.

1032
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,540
I want you to take a cab
to the farthest place you can find

1033
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,900
and have a nice large breakfast.

1034
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:15,580
I want you to take in a movie and
I want you to give me a phone call.

1035
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,500
Annie.

1036
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,460
Oh.

1037
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,420
We have to get back to work.

1038
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:08,020
Absolutely.
Cha-cha, cha-cha.

1039
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,780
What was that?
Get away from the window!

1040
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,700
Do you see anything?
Dial "911."

1041
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:35,620
Tell them shots fired at this address,
I'll meet them out on the street.

1042
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,740
I'm a cop.
Bobby!

1043
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:50,020
He's dead.
Please.

1044
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,340
Oh, my god.
Bobby!

1045
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,540
Hold that tight!
Where are they?

1046
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,020
Call the hospital and
tell them we're on our way!

1047
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:20,660
Move over!

1048
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,420
Oh, god.

1049
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:37,540
Jack, they tried to kill my baby.
Is he gonna be all right?

1050
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:41,940
I've got to talk to you, Jack.
What is it?

1051
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,340
Nothing, mama,
just police business.

1052
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:48,220
Come on.

1053
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,340
I was going over
the logs last night.

1054
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,420
Some of them have been
tampered with.

1055
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:02,300
Vehicle logs, patrol logs,
arrest logs.

1056
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,620
All different departments.

1057
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:08,700
What's that tell you?

1058
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:13,140
Only someone in command
has access to the files.

1059
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,940
So that's either me or you.

1060
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:21,020
Was it you?
Who is it, Jack?

1061
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,900
You got a wire on?

1062
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:32,540
No wire. Just you and me.
Family.

1063
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,260
You've got a friend
in Mexican Customs, don't you?

1064
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:46,180
You got that right.

1065
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:50,100
What happened, once you found out
about Freddy Angelo's heroin deal,

1066
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:53,340
you decided to rip him off
and go into business for yourself?

1067
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:56,140
It was a good idea.
We got a lot of scum off the street

1068
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:58,060
with very little cost
to the taxpayers.

1069
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,660
Somebody shot my brother, Jack!

1070
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:01,540
They thought it was me,
he was wearing my coat.

1071
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:04,500
Jesus, you think I had
something to do with that?

1072
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,420
You're like my own flesh and blood.

1073
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:10,260
I don't know what happened.
Somebody panicked.

1074
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,700
Who panicked?

1075
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:21,340
You've been behind this thing
all the way from the beginning.

1076
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,540
Freddy Angelo and the Mexicans.

1077
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:27,220
Yeah, and Carmine Tandino
and the boys in Storyville.

1078
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,500
And Daddy Mention.
Garbage.

1079
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,060
Where's the heroin, Jack?

1080
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,460
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

1081
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:50,460
There must be more than
five million dollars worth.

1082
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:54,300
It's a very big pie.
And you're entitled to a fair slice.

1083
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:57,180
So why don't you
take it and walk away.

1084
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:08,980
You taught me a lot
when I first came on the job.

1085
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,580
What was okay,
and what wasn't okay.

1086
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:17,540
Is dealing heroin, okay, Jack?
Is murder okay?

1087
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:25,540
I just wanted to go out a winner.
Thirty years.

1088
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,180
Your daddy never
cared anything about that.

1089
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,740
All he wanted to do
was chase the girls.

1090
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,620
And he caught the best one.

1091
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,140
I want to spend
rest of my life with her.

1092
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,220
You touch my mother again
I'll kill you!

1093
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,900
You can't talk to me that way.

1094
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:49,900
He's gonna be all right!

1095
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,060
Jack.

1096
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:33,340
So Kellom has an alibi
for every one of the killings.

1097
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:35,900
Then somebody is pulling
that trigger for him.

1098
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:40,260
Don't you have
any idea who it is?

1099
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:44,940
I've run out of ideas, Annie.

1100
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:02,740
Charity Hospital,
give me intensive care.

1101
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,300
Mrs. McSwain, please.

1102
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,260
Remy, I still can't believe it.
I can't believe it either.

1103
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,580
He admitted it right to my face.

1104
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,460
He was all the time
so good to us, you know.

1105
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,420
Take care of Bobby.

1106
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,340
I'll call you later.
Bye, mama.

1107
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,420
There's something
you should know.

1108
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:56,380
I had that magnet
placed in the property room

1109
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:00,020
next to the video tape.

1110
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:05,980
A guy owed me a favor.
And you promoted him.

1111
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:09,820
You knew that too, huh.

1112
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:16,340
Before I got promoted,
I used to be a bag man for Kellom.

1113
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,260
Just nickel and dime stuff.

1114
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:27,220
You figure it's the system.

1115
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:34,100
That it's not going to make a difference
if you take a few hundred here and there.

1116
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,700
You figure you
deserve a good life.

1117
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:44,700
For a decent living
for doing a dirty job.

1118
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:52,100
You tell yourself you
can be just as good a cop.

1119
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,460
I know.

1120
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,620
But you can't.

1121
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,500
Wait a minute.

1122
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,940
Maybe we should
look at this another way.

1123
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,900
How did those two Mexican smugglers
end up in the industrial canal?

1124
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:01,300
Came down from Lake
Pontchartrain, I guess.

1125
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:03,540
How did they get there?

1126
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:09,540
A fishing boat, probably.
Where's the boat?

1127
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,620
How are we supposed to
know where to find the boat?

1128
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,780
Dodge and De Soto
impounded a boat

1129
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,740
the night that Freddy
Angelo was killed.

1130
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:00,340
They're the killers,
those two clowns.

1131
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,300
Hey, captain.

1132
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:10,100
You're crying all over our future.

1133
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,580
We don't have any future, boys.
Maybe you don't.

1134
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:17,620
We've got a plane to catch. We've
got to get rid of this shit.

1135
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,940
Captain, just put the stuff down
and get out of here.

1136
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,140
We're dumping it.

1137
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,100
We don't have to listen
to you any more!

1138
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,980
I'm not gonna tell you again!

1139
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:37,180
Oh, shit.

1140
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,380
Just stay here.

1141
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:18,300
Ohhh!

1142
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,140
Oh, Jack.

1143
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:00,500
Hey, Remy,
where are you at?

1144
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,580
Throw the gun up on the deck.

1145
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:10,740
Climb up on out of there.

1146
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:20,940
We had a perfectly good situation here
And you had to screw it up on us.

1147
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:25,420
You turned on us,
Remy. I didn't turn on you.

1148
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,620
What are you talking about?
We're all family, aren't we?

1149
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:31,660
Can't we work something out?
That's that old Remy.

1150
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:35,740
What do you say,
what's it gonna be?

1151
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,300
Move out on the dock.

1152
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:43,940
I've got to hand it to you guys,
the way you handled that situation.

1153
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:49,020
I mean it was genius.
Real genius.

1154
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,220
What do you take us for?
Assholes.

1155
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:57,500
You see them?
I can't see a goddamn thing.

1156
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,780
They've got to come up
for air sometime.

1157
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:44,820
The bitch is over here.
Come on.

1158
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:59,060
What's that?
He's on the other boat.

1159
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:31,580
We got 'em now.
Next stop, Tahiti.

1160
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:47,820
Andre!

1161
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,940
Remy?

1162
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,300
Are you all right?
Uh-huh.

1163
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,820
Jesus Christ, it's gonna blow!

1164
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,460
Run!

1164
01:32:41,305 --> 01:33:41,366
