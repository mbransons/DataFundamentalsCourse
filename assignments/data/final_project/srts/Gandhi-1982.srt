Oh, uh...
Neither have I.

479

Oh.
I'm awfully sorry.

Huh.

00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,910
would you lend Mr. Gandhi
a shilling for a taxi?

482
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,110
I beg your pardon, sir?

483
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,111
How far will you
be going, Gandhi?

484
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,710
Well, now that this is settled,
I had thought seriously of going back to India.

485
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,630
But a shilling will do
splendidly for the moment.

486
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,910
Thank you.

487
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:21,430
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...

488
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,150
but I can find
my own way out.

I'm sure he hates it.

Mr. Gandhi, have you 
refused to wear European clothes?

506
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,510
No, I haven't refused.

507
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,750
I simply wanted to dress the way
my comrades in prison dress.

508
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,590
Mr. Gandhi, will you
support the war effort?

509
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,470
If, as a citizen, I wish to enjoy 
the benefits and protection of the British Empire,

510
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,990
it would be wrong of me
not to help in its defence.

Thank you.
Now that you're back in India,

I don't know.
Mr. Gandhi--

514
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,710
I don't know.
Mr. Gandhi, one more question.

515
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,590
As an Indian woman, how 
could you accept the indignity of prison?

516
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,710
My dignity comes 
from following my husband.

517
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,190
Thank you very much.

518
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,430
Just a few words, and 
then we'll get you to civilisation.

519
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,030
May I?

520
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,350
I'm glad to be home...

521
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,350
And, uh...

00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:39,510
I thank you for your greeting.

That's young Nehru.

his mother's good looks...

I must say, when I first 
saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay,

531
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,669
I never thought I'd 
be greeting you as a national hero.

532
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,510
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

533

PATEL:
Oh, yes, you are.

534
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,310
It's been 200 years 
since an Indian has cocked a snook

535
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,709
at the British Empire
and got away with it.

536
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,430
And stop calling me Mr. 
Patel. You're not a junior clerk anymore.

The new military governor of the 
Northwest Frontier Province was on that ship.

Too bad you came
back third class.

He might have
been impressed

by a successful barrister 
who had outmanoeuvred General Smuts.

you to meet Mr. Jinnah, our joint host,

546

member of congress 
and leader of the Muslim League.

547

JINNAH:
How do you do?

548
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,310
And Mr. Prakash, who, I fear

549
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,350
is awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder.

550
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:58,190
I have not actually pulled
the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.

551
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,710
I have simply written

552
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,990
that if an Englishman kills
an Indian for disobeying his law,

553
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:05,350
then it is an Indian's duty
to kill an Englishman

554
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,830
for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his.

555
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,470
It's a clever argument. I'm 
not sure it will produce the end you desire.

556
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:14,910
We hope you're going to join 
us in our struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.

557
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,870
Well--
Uh, excuse me.

558
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,309
Uh, may I, Mohan?

559
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,030
Uh, there's someone
I would like him to meet.

560
00:44:20,189 --> 00:44:21,630
Oh, excuse me.

561
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:24,869
ANDREWS:
Sorry to rush you.

562
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,630
He told the press 
he'd support the British in the war.

563
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:30,469
That's nonviolence
for you.

564
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,509
ANDREWS:
You know, Mohan...

565
00:44:33,669 --> 00:44:35,750
now I have a
confession to make.

566
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,589
I didn't decide to come
to South Africa.

Professor
Gokhale sent me.

568
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,670
We are trying 
to make a nation, Gandhi.

569
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:47,590
But the British keep
trying to break us up

570
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:51,270
into religions,
principalities, provinces.

571
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,469
What you were writing
in South Africa,

572
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:56,149
that's what we need here.

573
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:58,509
I have so much
to learn about India.

574
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,630
And I have to begin
my practise again.

575
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:02,510
One needs money
to run a journal.

576
00:45:02,749 --> 00:45:05,950
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.
This is Indian talk.

577
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,990
We want none of you
imperialists here.

578
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,830
All right, then, I'll 
go and write my report to the viceroy.

579
00:45:13,149 --> 00:45:15,390
You go and find
a pretty Hindu woman

580
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,269
and convert her
to Christianity.

581
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,309
That's as much mischief
as you are allowed.

582
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:24,269
Come, let's find
a quiet corner.

583
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,069
Now, you-- You 
forget about your practise.

584
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:30,269
You have other
things to do.

585
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,510
India has many men
with too much wealth.

586
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:38,710
And it's their privilege 
to nourish the effort of the few

587
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:42,629
who can raise India
from servitude and apathy.

588
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:44,470
I'll see to it.

589
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,349
You begin your journal.

590
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:47,829
I have little to say.

591
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:49,710
Come, come, come.
Let's sit down.

592
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,989
India is an alien
country to me.

593
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,189
Change that.

594
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,669
Go and find India.

595
00:45:56,909 --> 00:45:58,350
Not what you see here,

596
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,909
but the real India.

597
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:03,869
You will see what
needs to be said...

598
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,749
what we need to hear.

599
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:15,269
When I saw you
in that tunic, I knew.

600
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:19,989
I knew I could
die in peace.

601
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:24,029
Make India proud of herself.

602
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:44,909
Charlie, please. 
You're both being foolish.

603
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:48,069
But the air is lovely. Anyway,
there's no room in there.

604
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:50,749
Please! Come in.

605
00:49:50,909 --> 00:49:52,629
Come in.
No violence, please.

The Germans are
worn out as it is.

630
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:27,149
And our first act
should be...

631
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:30,309
to convene a congress
party convention...

632
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:32,909

their repression.

would it throw up?

advocated passive anything.

prayer and fasting.

Mr. Gandhi,

1126
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:31,301
even if His Majesty could 
waive all other considerations, uh,

1127
01:29:31,461 --> 01:29:35,461
he has a duty to the millions
of his Muslim subjects,

who are a minority
in this realm.

1129
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:41,181

that his troops

are essential

and the freedom to speak.

1743

how much it costs them
to keep me in poverty.

1753

It can come from work
and pride in what you do.

1756
02:19:33,575 --> 02:19:36,376
India lives in her villages

1757
02:19:36,615 --> 02:19:39,376
and the terrible poverty there
can only be removed

1758
02:19:39,576 --> 02:19:42,816
if their local skills
can be revived.

1759
02:19:43,216 --> 02:19:46,096
Poverty is the worst form
of violence.

1760
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:49,136
And a constructive programme
is the only...

1761
02:19:49,335 --> 02:19:52,495
nonviolent solution
to India's agony.

1762

It will not necessarily be
progress for India

the unhappiness of the West.

in this war?

No pain?

1768
02:20:18,015 --> 02:20:19,456
What you cannot do...

1769
02:20:19,696 --> 02:20:22,255
is accept injustice
from Hitler or anyone.

1770
02:20:22,456 --> 02:20:25,456
You must make
the injustice visible.

Be prepared to die
like a soldier to do so.

No. That's what you get

Bapu has always said...

1779
02:21:00,815 --> 02:21:03,535
there were two kinds
of slavery in India:

1780
02:21:03,936 --> 02:21:07,535
One for women,
one for the untouchables.

1781
02:21:08,055 --> 02:21:11,215
And he has always
fought against both.

Does it rankle, being
separated in this way?

In Hindu philosophy...

1784
02:21:23,376 --> 02:21:24,776
the way to God...

1785
02:21:24,975 --> 02:21:27,616
is to free yourself
of possessions...

1786

and of passions.

1787

Bapu has always struggled
to find the way to God.

1788
02:21:38,576 --> 02:21:42,576
Do you mean that
he gave up married life?

1789
02:21:45,095 --> 02:21:47,695
Four times he tried...

1790
02:21:48,415 --> 02:21:49,815
and failed.

1791
02:21:51,496 --> 02:21:53,416
But then he took
a solemn vow.

02:50:16,173 --> 02:50:17,573
Bapu.

2054
02:50:19,053 --> 02:50:20,332
Oh.

2055
02:50:23,173 --> 02:50:27,853
So, what kind of warrior
have you been in that warfare?

2056
02:50:28,012 --> 02:50:31,013
Oh, not a very good one.

2057
02:50:31,213 --> 02:50:33,812
That's why I have
so much tolerance...

2058
02:50:34,013 --> 02:50:36,293
for the other scoundrels
of the world.

2059
02:50:41,373 --> 02:50:42,972
Sardar?

2060
02:50:43,132 --> 02:50:46,493
Ask Panditji to consider
what we've discussed.

2061
02:50:52,692 --> 02:50:54,813
Enough!
One more.

2062
02:50:55,133 --> 02:50:57,733
You're a temptress!
Just an admirer.

2063
02:50:57,973 --> 02:51:00,012
Nothing's more
dangerous...

2064
02:51:00,252 --> 02:51:02,332
especially for an old man.

2065
02:51:11,413 --> 02:51:13,533
There's a sadness about him.

2066
02:51:15,013 --> 02:51:16,533
He thinks he's failed.

2067
02:51:16,773 --> 02:51:18,133
Why?

2068
02:51:18,372 --> 02:51:21,693
My God, if anything's proven him right,
it's what happened these last months.

2069
02:51:23,332 --> 02:51:25,772
I may be blinded
by my love for him...

2070
02:51:26,493 --> 02:51:27,773
but I believe...

2071
02:51:27,972 --> 02:51:30,052
when we most needed it...

2072
02:51:30,253 --> 02:51:33,292
he offered the world
a way out of madness.

2073
02:51:35,892 --> 02:51:37,172
But he doesn't see it.

2074
02:51:38,092 --> 02:51:39,932
Neither does the world.

2075
02:51:47,213 --> 02:51:48,733
Namaste.

2076
02:51:49,173 --> 02:51:50,693
Namaste.

2077
02:51:52,693 --> 02:51:54,172
Namaste.

2078
02:52:06,413 --> 02:52:07,813
Hmm.

2079
02:52:12,053 --> 02:52:14,133
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

2080
02:52:16,812 --> 02:52:18,533
GANDHI:
Oh, God!

2081
02:52:19,292 --> 02:52:21,172
Oh, God.

2082
02:52:58,293 --> 02:53:00,213
GANDHI:
When I despair...

2083
02:53:00,493 --> 02:53:02,332
I remember

2084
02:53:02,653 --> 02:53:04,812
that all through history,

2085
02:53:05,013 --> 02:53:09,332
the way of truth and love
has always won.

2086
02:53:11,092 --> 02:53:14,532
There have been tyrants
and murderers,

2087
02:53:14,772 --> 02:53:17,692
and for a time,
they can seem invincible,

2088
02:53:17,893 --> 02:53:21,173
but in the end, they always fall.

2089
02:53:22,812 --> 02:53:24,292
Think of it.

2090
02:53:25,973 --> 02:53:27,532
Always.
