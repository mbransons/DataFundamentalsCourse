1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,751
Darling, l've got Lord and Lady Ferncliffe.

3
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,794
They'll come to dinner next Friday.

4
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,339
l just had a radio from them on the boat.

5
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,717
Wasn't that brilliant of me,
getting the Ferncliffes?

6
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,096
Yes, that was very brilliant of you,
if you want the Ferncliffes.

7
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,099
But l do. You remember them, darling.

8
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,101
They entertained us in London.

9
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:28,315
l remember them well,
and very dull it was, too.

10
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,484
Australian mutton...

11
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,862
and a lot of people
who'd been buried for years...

12
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,406
and got up just to eat that mutton.

13
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,284
You don't realize
how important it is, Oliver.

14
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,078
Everybody will be after them.

15
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,664
l thought you and Ferncliffe
had lots in common.

16
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,999
lsn't he interested in shipping, too?

17
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,961
Mr. Oliver Jordan accepts.

18
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,839
Of course, it's terribly short notice.

19
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,219
Thank you, Gustave.

20
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,222
Let's see. Lord and Lady Ferncliffe...

21
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,683
the Talbots: the Doctor and Lucy.

22
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:08,188
l saw that your precious Carlotta Vance
arrived on the Europa yesterday.

23
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,066
Carlotta? Fine, let's have her.

24
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,279
Of course, she goes with a different crowd
than the Ferncliffes over there.

25
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,782
All those impossible fast people.
At her age, too.

26
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,577
Nonsense. Carlotta has no age.

27
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,747
Oliver, just because she was once
your favorite actress.

28
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,797
Dad, l thought you'd gone.

29
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,550
Well, if it isn't her ladyship.

30
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,762
Don't look at me, l'm a sight.
Didn't sleep a wink.

31
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,016
l thought l heard you moving around
in your room.

32
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,310
Couldn't you sleep, either?

33
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,521
- Nerves?
- l don't know. l suppose so.

34
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,193
Say, pips,
there isn't anything really wrong, is there?

35
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:01,116
Now, how can the shipping business go on
if the owner's tie isn't straight?

36
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,209
Paula, l'll want you and Ernest
for dinner next Friday.

37
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,002
When does his boat land?

38
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,712
l don't know, Mother.

39
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,255
You don't know?

40
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,217
Aren't you being awfully vague
about your fiancÃ©?

41
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,971
l certainly hope Ernest is more excited
about this wedding than you seem to be.

42
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,517
And don't forget,
we're going shopping this afternoon.

43
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,854
l can't this afternoon, Mother. l'm sorry.

44
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,773
But you've got to. You've simply got to.

45
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,025
Do you realize you're being married
in a month...

46
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,944
and you haven't got a stitch of trousseau?

47
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,197
Why can't you go shopping with me
this afternoon?

48
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,533
- l've an engagement.
- What engagement?

49
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,953
l'm going to a concert.

50
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,622
A concert. That reminds me.

51
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,541
When Cousin Hattie comes in
this morning...

52
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,210
l want to give her our Philharmonic seats
for Thursday.

53
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,254
Whom are you going to the concert with?

54
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,966
Hello. Dr. Talbot's residence?
Mrs. Talbot, please.

55
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:03,178
Mrs. Oliver Jordan calling.
Paula, what concert....

56
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:09,977
Lucy? How are you, my dear? Listen, Lucy.

57
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,313
Lord and Lady Ferncliffe
arrive from London tomorrow...

58
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,400
and l want you and Wayne
a week from tonight.

59
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,152
Yes, dinner at 8:00.

60
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,952
- Mr. Jordan's late.
- He probably stopped at the dock.

61
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,288
- Where'd you put those invoices?
- What invoices?

62
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,414
For the Castilian.

63
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,333
What's the hurry?
She's not sailing till tomorrow.

64
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,882
Good morning, Mr. Jordan.

65
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,885
Good morning. lt's cold outside.

66
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,721
- Why, l thought it was real pleasant.
- Not down on the dock.

67
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,723
- Cold down there, all right.
- Yes.

68
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,308
Just a minute.

69
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,815
The Castilian isn't going to sail tomorrow.

70
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,735
- What?
- Not sailing?

71
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:04,114
No use sending a boat out
without enough cargo in her...

72
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,533
to keep her down in the water.

73
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,411
My, my.

74
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,165
No Jordan boat has missed a trip
in 60 years.

75
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,416
l know that.

76
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,793
Will the Santa Clara sail next week?

77
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,504
Cheer up, Fosdick.

78
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,590
lt's just as good a line as it ever was.

79
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,883
The best in the world.

80
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,468
Right you are.

81
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,597
Some other people think so, too.

82
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,685
Wish l knew who it was
that's trying to buy up our stock.

83
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,105
You're not going to lose control of the line,
Mr. Jordan.

84
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,567
Mr. Jordan, your father, your grandfather--

85
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,362
No. Of course not.

86
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:47,574
And we're going to put up a fight
they wouldn't be ashamed of, either.

87
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:51,870
And the first step in that.
Did you get ahold of Mr. Packard?

88
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,122
- He's coming in this morning.
- Good.

89
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,839
Mr. Jordan,
Miss Carlotta Vance is here to see you.

90
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,384
Carlotta? Here? Outside?

91
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,013
Oliver! Ducky!

92
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,642
l never was so glad to see anyone
in all my life.

93
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,479
Carlotta, this is a surprise.

94
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,690
Why, you look marvellous.

95
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,818
Do l? l do, don't l?

96
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,570
Divine.

97
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,781
Oliver, actually,
you're looking handsomer than ever.

98
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,330
- A little gray.
- Gray? Nonsense!

99
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,166
Distinguished.

100
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,042
Come on over and sit down.

101
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,420
- Oliver....
- Let me look at you.

102
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,549
What are you doing over here?

103
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,719
Trying to mend my shattered fortune.

104
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,305
You picked a nice day for it.

105
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,141
ln the right part of town, too.

106
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:58,562
There are our financiers
sitting on those benches out there.

107
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,647
Now, come along, Carlotta.

108
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,526
Who did you come down to the Battery
to see? Not me.

109
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,821
No, sir. l'll not deceive you.

110
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:12,618
l came down here to see
the United States Customs lnspector.

111
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,788
lsador J. Greenbaum, the son of a....

112
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,708
Say, why shouldn't l own six fur coats?

113
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,044
Why not, indeed? lt's perfectly reasonable.

114
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,464
And when l was standing
in the Customs office, what did l sight?

115
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,840
''Jordan Line.''

116
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:31,470
Says l to myself, says l,
''Maybe the old gentleman is in.''

117
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,056
And here you are.

118
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,476
l'm very grateful to Mr. Greenbaum.

119
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,562
Oliver, l'm as flat as a millpond.

120
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,773
l haven't got a sou.

121
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,859
Carlotta, go along with you.

122
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:50,280
What about all those gilt-edged securities
and your theater?

123
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,075
That alone ought to bring you
enough to live on.

124
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,913
My chief reason for coming to
this country is to get rid of that rattrap.

125
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,748
What's the matter with it?

126
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,377
For six months,
they haven't taken the lock off the door.

127
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,839
lt's now known as
the ''spiders' rendezvous.''

128
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,508
Can't collect rent from them.

129
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,220
When old Starfield gave me that theater...

130
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,807
l thought it was very magnificent
of the old boy.

131
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,185
Now l wish l'd taken a sandwich.

132
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,897
Lotta, you always exaggerated.

133
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,233
l bet you're rolling in wealth.

134
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,818
What have l got?

135
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:32,114
Railroads, oil, cotton.
That's what they gave you in my day.

136
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,616
l only could take what they had.

137
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,286
And you know what's happened
to those things.

138
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:42,124
You are down to cases.
''lnternational star returns to stage.''

139
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,919
Never. l'll have my double chins in privacy.

140
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,425
l've seen too many hardened arteries
dragged out to make a first-night holiday.

141
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,885
Oh, no.

142
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:58,265
Now, Carlotta, your stock
must bring you in a little something.

143
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,143
lt can't cost you an awful lot
to live over there.

144
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,772
No? You saw how it was like at Antibes.

145
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,274
You and Millicent.

146
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:12,738
10 and 20 for luncheon, cocktails.
Most of them staying on for dinner.

147
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,993
Very same thing at my house in London.
Everybody popping in.

148
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,747
Noel, Winston, and once in a while, Wales.

149
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:27,044
l didn't do so badly for a little girl
from Quincy, lllinois, eh, ducky?

150
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,796
But it all takes money.

151
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:35,594
Why don't you get rid of all that,
live over here for a while?

152
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:42,392
l've been in New York four days,
the first time l've been back in 10 years...

153
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,770
and l'm lost already.

154
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,898
No, everything's changed.

155
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,734
l couldn't stand it here. l'd die.

156
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,863
l belong to the Delmonico period.

157
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,701
Table at the window
looking out on Fifth Avenue.

158
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,706
Boxes with flowers,
and pink lampshades...

159
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,752
string orchestra and l don't know....

160
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:12,047
Yes. Willow plumes, lnverness capes...

161
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,927
dry champagne and snow on the ground.

162
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,848
They don't even have snow anymore.

163
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,935
- Pardon me, Mr. Jordan.
- Miss Copeland?

164
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,146
- Mr. Eton is outside. He wants to see you.
- l'll go and see him.

165
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,399
Will you pardon me a minute, Lotta?

166
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,579
Let me get that for you.

167
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,207
Thank you, my dear.

168
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,212
Miss Vance, l....

169
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,048
l just want to.... l hope you won't mind...

170
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,846
but l can't help telling you
how exciting it is seeing you right here.

171
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,598
How sweet.

172
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,016
l shall never forget it.

173
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,978
l saw you when you played in Trelawney.
You were wonderful.

174
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,564
Yes. That was the last thing l did.

175
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,650
Yes. l remember it
as plainly as if it was yesterday...

176
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,737
though l was only a little girl at the time.

177
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,238
How extraordinary.

178
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:25,037
- lt's wonderful seeing you like this.
- Yes, it is.

179
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,790
You know, we must have a nice talk
about the Civil War sometime...

180
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,502
just you and l.

181
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,423
l got rid of him.

182
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,514
What do you think
about me selling my Jordan stock?

183
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:48,936
l'd rather you didn't, just at this time.

184
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,190
We've been hit, just as everyone has,
of course.

185
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,778
l'm afraid you wouldn't get
what it was worth if you sold it now.

186
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:02,741
l'd expect to lose something on it.
But you know, ladies must live.

187
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,118
You see, Carlotta, it's like this.

188
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,497
The Jordan stock has never really been
on the market.

189
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:14,545
As a matter of fact, it's very closely held.
Only six or seven people in all.

190
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,714
Of course,
you've got a very small block of it.

191
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:21,093
Let's see, what did you pay for it anyway,
do you remember?

192
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,095
$61,240.

193
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,099
Why, Carlotta, you're marvellous.

194
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:31,103
No. l remember because it's the only stock
l ever paid for myself.

195
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:36,316
But then you said it was good.
And yes, it was for nearly 20 years.

196
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,861
The last two or three or....

197
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:44,324
Oliver, you wouldn't want to
buy it back yourself, would you?

198
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,327
Yes, l would, Carlotta.

199
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,502
But l'd find it rather difficult just now.

200
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,254
Why, Oliver...

201
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,134
l always thought of you
having all the money in the world.

202
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,386
l thought so, too, for a time.

203
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:09,099
When l think of Oliver Jordan lll....

204
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,227
l dropped that years ago.

205
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,189
Dear Oliver, you were sweet.

206
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,984
So serious. So respectful.

207
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,946
l was very fond of you, Oliver.

208
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,991
l was very much in love with you, Carlotta.

209
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:31,455
You were the most entrancing creature
in the world, and l was at your feet.

210
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,540
So was all New York.

211
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,961
lf you went to a restaurant, it was made.

212
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,632
lf you wore a certain hat,
it became the rage.

213
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,636
l was rather gorgeous, wasn't l?

214
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,097
Remember? They named
everything after me.

215
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,267
Cigars, race horses...

216
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,979
perfumes, battleships.

217
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,067
They were a little previous on that.

218
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,612
But one thing l shall always remember.

219
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,490
The day you were 21 ...

220
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,743
you asked me to marry you, Oliver.

221
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,412
What a young fool
you must have thought me.

222
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,998
No, l thought it very sweet of you.

223
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,585
You see, l was 30-ish.

224
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,965
l remember l went home and wept a little.

225
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,134
They didn't often ask me to marry them.

226
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,846
You broke my heart when you refused me,
Carlotta.

227
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,723
So l buried my grief
in the shipping business.

228
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,141
Dear Oliver.

229
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,477
Mr. Packard is here now.

230
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,940
Tell him to come right in.
Do you mind, Carlotta?

231
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:44,027
He's quite a fellow, Dan Packard.
Used to be a miner.

232
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,905
Big Western stuff, you know.

233
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,241
How interesting. l'd like to meet him.

234
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,409
All right, Mr. Packard.

235
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,495
That's no elevator, that's a birdcage.

236
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,957
Jordan, what kind of a dump is this,
anyway?

237
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,959
l beg your pardon.

238
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,921
Dan Packard. This is Miss Carlotta Vance.

239
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,840
- Miss Vance.
- How do you do?

240
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,343
Wait a minute. Not Carlotta Vance?

241
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,511
Yes.

242
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,264
Why, l know you.

243
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,601
Jordan, you old son of a gun, you.

244
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,812
Yes. Saw me when he was a boy.

245
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,481
Nursie held him up
so he'd get a good look.

246
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:25,444
Your picture was on the wall of every
mining shack up there in Montana...

247
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,779
right alongside of John L. Sullivan.

248
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,574
Sutton's Opera House.

249
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,202
What was the name
of that piece you were in?

250
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,037
You wore pants.

251
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,915
Still do. That's my exit cue.

252
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,000
When will l see you, Lotta? Soon?

253
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,793
Millicent called me up this morning.

254
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,545
l'm dining with you next week, Friday.

255
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:44,963
Fine, of course.

256
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,841
l'm just dying to see Paula again.

257
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,093
l'm sure she's crazy to see you.

258
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,055
You were so sweet to her
when she was in London last year.

259
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,556
But where are you staying?

260
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,433
l'm stopping at the Hotel Versailles.

261
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,644
The old Versailles.

262
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:02,940
-O-O-O-O'Brien.
-That's it. Goodbye.

263
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,027
Toodly-oo, Lochinvar.

264
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,905
What did she call me?

265
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,575
Sit down, Dan.

266
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,161
- How've you been?
- Just fine.

267
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:19,790
l can only stay a minute.
Running down to Washington.

268
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,460
Seems like the President wants
to get down at the bottom of things.

269
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,589
The reason l asked you to come over, Dan,
was l wanted to put something up to you.

270
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,383
Sure. Go ahead.

271
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,051
lt's about the Jordan Line.

272
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,429
Say, who put up this building,
Peter Stuyvesant?

273
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,641
Looks more like a museum than an office.

274
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,061
lt was the last word
when the old gentleman built it.

275
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,397
lt's been like this for 75 years.

276
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,067
l hope those old tubs of yours
don't date to this office.

277
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,487
What do you got on your mind?

278
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:56,243
You know all about our business.
l don't need to go into that.

279
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,705
Of course, this Depression
isn't going to last forever.

280
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,125
But if it takes a little longer
than we figure...

281
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,420
l want to know
if you and your associates...

282
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,590
would be in a position
to sort of tide us over.

283
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:15,429
l appreciate that l'd have to turn over
some of my holdings to you.

284
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,390
l'd rather not disturb
the other stockholders.

285
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,060
l don't know anything
about your business, Jordan.

286
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,272
But it looks to me like it's gone to seed.

287
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,524
All l have to do is look around this office.

288
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,903
To tell you the truth,
l don't think you have much to offer.

289
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,529
Now, look here, Packard.

290
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,324
Our ships have traveled the ocean
for a century.

291
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,409
We started from clipper ships.

292
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,329
We're not going to stop.
We're not through.

293
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:45,459
l'm sorry, Jordan. l didn't mean anything.

294
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,046
You know, l'm a businessman,
and everybody's bothering you.

295
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,508
- l apologize, Jordan.
- That's all right.

296
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,844
Now, l may be wrong.
Tell you what you do.

297
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,804
You get me some figures on this thing:

298
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:02,184
the assets, the stockholders,
a list of them, and the holdings....

299
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:06,480
You submit it to me,
l'll give you an answer within 24 hours.

300
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,440
That's very kind of you.

301
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,196
- What's the matter? Got a pain?
- Oh, no.

302
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,158
- lt's a little indigestion.
- lndigestion? Half a lemon.

303
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,702
l get it all the time.
Half a lemon in hot water.

304
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,871
l got to travel, l'm in a hurry.

305
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,126
You send me all the dope.
l'll do whatever l can. So long.

306
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:45,102
Mr. Jordan, l wouldn't trust that man
as far as l could throw a bull by the tail.

307
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,189
l hope you're wrong.

308
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,235
l hope we're both wrong.

309
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,322
Why, what's the matter, sir?

310
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,284
l'm all right.

311
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,838
Hello.

312
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,799
Mrs. Jordan, sir.

313
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,555
Hello, dear.

314
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,056
Oliver?

315
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,475
Darling, l'm simply out of my mind.

316
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,563
l'm still shy one couple,
and l just can't find an extra man.

317
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,857
What am l going to do, dear?

318
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,152
You can do something for me, dear.

319
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,447
You can invite Dan Packard and his wife.

320
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,408
You're joking.

321
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,369
Ask that common little woman
to my house?

322
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,788
And that noisy, vulgar man?

323
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,124
He smells Oklahoma.

324
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,044
Oh, no, they're not as bad as that.

325
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,174
Anyway, it would be an enormous favor
to me if you did.

326
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,677
Of course, if it will help you, dear.

327
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:05,891
Hattie, you can't imagine.
Hattie just came in, dear.

328
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,184
Maybe she can help.

329
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,395
But do try to think of an extra man,
won't you, dear?

330
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,692
l will, dear.

331
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,110
Goodbye.

332
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,697
Those Packards. Really.

333
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,533
Another dinner party?

334
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,369
Only a small one, darling.

335
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:30,791
Otherwise, l'd love to have you and Ed,
you understand?

336
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,336
No need to apologize. A cousin is a cousin.

337
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,171
And Ed hates functions.

338
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,551
Ed hates anything that keeps him
from going to the movies every night.

339
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,595
l guess l'm what's called ''a Garbo widow.''

340
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,313
Hello?

341
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,861
Who is it?

342
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:02,573
Mrs. who? Jordan?

343
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,368
Mrs. Oliver Jordan. Just a minute.

344
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,623
Who's that on the telephone?

345
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:15,085
A Mrs. Oliver Jordan
wants to speak to you on the phone.

346
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,671
- Who?
- Mrs. Jordan.

347
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,756
- Mrs. Oliver Jordan?
- Yes.

348
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,843
Holy cat!
Hand me that telephone, you nitwit.

349
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,056
Hello, Mrs. Jordan.

350
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,685
Of course l remember you.
l've seen you at the races.

351
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:35,606
Mr. Jordan and l are giving a small dinner
for Lord and Lady Ferncliffe...

352
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,442
two very dear friends
of mine from England.

353
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,861
Gee, that sounds swell to me.

354
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:47,868
lt's awful nice of you to ask us,
Mrs. Jordan. We'll be glad to accept.

355
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,039
Goodbye.

356
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,042
Don't you want to know the date?

357
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,920
Sure, honey.

358
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:02,007
Friday, a week from tonight.

359
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,344
Dinner at 8:00. Thanks.

360
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,430
Goodbye for real this time, Mrs. Jordan.

361
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,563
Tina, get my engagement book.

362
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,735
lt's around here somewhere.

363
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,742
Take this down.

364
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,288
Next Friday evening...

365
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,751
at the Oliver Jordans', dinner at 8:00.

366
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,090
Me eating with Lord and Lady Ferncliffe.

367
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,593
You don't have to write that down, stupid.

368
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,474
Listen, Tina.
Don't crack about this to Mr. Packard.

369
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,102
l want to spring it on him
at the right time.

370
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,522
That slug never wants to meet
any refined people.

371
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,526
Clear that away, Tina.

372
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,865
Wait a minute!

373
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:18,667
What did Dr. Talbot say?
What time's he coming?

374
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,586
He didn't say exactly.

375
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:24,256
He asked, ''Was there any symptoms?''
And l said, ''No, l didn't think so.''

376
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:27,050
He said, all right then,
he'd be over sometime today.

377
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:30,137
l got a cold, and my legs ache all over.

378
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,932
- You didn't tell me to say that.
- You should have known it.

379
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,545
- Here's your new hat.
- Goody.

380
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,929
Higher, you fool.

381
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,645
- Don't it look cute?
- Swell.

382
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:23,565
Tell Oscar to pack.
Just overnight stuff, that's all.

383
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,363
You in bed again? What's the matter?

384
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,281
l don't feel good.

385
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,080
What's the idea of the hat? Going out?

386
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:43,794
What do you eat all that sweet stuff for?
Why don't you get up and do something?

387
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,755
You don't care what l do or how l feel.

388
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,967
Look at me.
l was never sick a day in my life, and why?

389
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,887
lt's because l do things
and get out and get to moving.

390
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:57,641
Oscar, l don't want any dinner clothes.
That's the reason.

391
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:03,689
Dr. Talbot says that you're an extrovert
and l'm an introvert.

392
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,400
A what?

393
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,570
An introvert, you dummy!

394
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:14,366
That's why l've got to be quiet a good deal
and have time to reflect in.

395
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,288
Reflect in?
What have you got to reflect about?

396
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:22,124
l have to think and act at the same time.

397
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,251
You know why
l'm going to Washington tonight?

398
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:28,088
Because the President wants to
consult me about the affairs of the nation.

399
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,632
- That's why.
- What's the matter with them?

400
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:38,098
Everything's the matter with them.
That's why he's sending for me.

401
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:42,686
You know, l wouldn't be a bit surprised
but what he offered me a Cabinet job.

402
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,730
What do you know about that?

403
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,150
Where'd that buffer get to?

404
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,944
You ought to be married
to some of the guys l see.

405
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:53,113
They'd give you
something to reflect about.

406
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:56,825
l called on a fellow this morning
who can't handle one little business...

407
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,746
and l juggle 50 things at once,
and he doesn't handle one.

408
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,331
Here's the blowoff.

409
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,417
He's got the layout l've been looking for,
for two years...

410
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,420
and the sap lays it right in my lap.

411
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:13,634
Dan Packard owns the best shipping line
between here and the tropics...

412
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:16,094
and Mr. Oliver Jordan is out on his ear.

413
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,972
We're invited there for dinner
next Friday night...

414
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,683
and l'm going to wear my new silver
with the white fox.

415
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:26,188
- We're not going. That's out.
- How do you get that way?

416
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,942
- Why not?
- l can't go and eat his dinner.

417
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,486
lf he's a sucker, that's his funeral.

418
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:38,617
No. Presidents in Washington
and all those rummies...

419
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,370
but you can't go anywheres with me.

420
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,747
Once in our life,
we get asked to a classy house.

421
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:46,583
l got a new dress to knock their eye out
and we're going!

422
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,670
- We're not going!
- We are so, you big crook!

423
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,548
You pull a dirty deal
and it ruins my social chances!

424
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:56,635
- You can't get away with it!
- Go lay an egg.

425
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:14,695
Danny....

426
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:24,580
Kitty wants to go see
all the great big lords and ladies...

427
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,748
in their big, beautiful house.

428
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:39,553
lt's for Lord and Lady Ferncliffe.

429
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:43,056
- Who said so?
- She did.

430
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,601
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

431
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,020
Because you were mean
to poor little Kitty.

432
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:52,316
Ferncliffe, you know who he is?
He's the richest man in England.

433
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,109
- Goody, you'll go?
- Certainly l'll go.

434
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:57,988
l've been trying to meet him for two years.
That ties up with the Jordan stuff.

435
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:01,074
- See, and l did it for you.
- You know what l'll do?

436
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,577
l'll buy up that Jordan stock
through dummies.

437
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,623
l'll use Baldridge and Whitestone,
fellows like that.

438
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,418
- Keep my name out of it.
- Out of what?

439
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,174
Dr. Talbot's come.

440
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:23,096
Good. He'll take care of you all right.
Ferncliffe. What a break.

441
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,724
- Goodbye, kitten. See you tomorrow.
- That's fine, goodbye.

442
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,392
Come on, Oscar, let's go.

443
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:30,771
Tina, quick, get me that other jacket,
the one with the fur.

444
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,774
Hurry up, you nitwit!

445
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,278
Clear the things off the bed
and fix it up a bit.

446
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,536
Tina, leave me my book.

447
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:49,665
You know, the fat one
that Dr. Talbot gave me.

448
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,882
lt says Aspects of the Adult Mind.

449
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,885
- Here it is.
- Leave it here.

450
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:04,596
Now, show the doctor in.

451
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,369
Well, what's this?

452
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,413
Hello, Doctor.

453
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:31,915
l just ran into your husband downstairs.

454
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:34,001
He tells me
he's going to see the President.

455
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,712
Yes, he's going to help him fix things.

456
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,801
What's wrong with the little lady?

457
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:45,554
Doctor, l don't know.

458
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:50,684
l kind of ached all over
and felt funny and....

459
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:55,522
You got to be careful of the flu,
and l thought maybe if l stayed in bed....

460
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:58,483
You never come and see me anymore
unless l send for you.

461
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,986
Now listen, Kitty, l've been very busy.

462
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,907
But l'm so lonely for you, Wayne.
You know how l need you.

463
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,868
l don't do anything all day
except just long for you.

464
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,829
Why don't you try and read?

465
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:16,960
l know. You're tired of me.

466
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:24,092
- No, l'm not, honey, but you know
- Wayne, darling!

467
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:40,609
Look at you, quivering with pride.

468
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:45,030
Just 'cause you're going to be ate tonight
by Lord and Lady what's his name.

469
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,955
The aspic.

470
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:57,793
- lt's too divine, Mrs. Wendel.
- Thank you, ma'am.

471
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,837
lt was the only thing l was worried about.

472
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,590
No, l think that's better, Mrs. Wendel.

473
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,009
What is it, The Wreck of the Hesperus?

474
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,929
lt's the British lion
in honor of Lord Ferncliffe.

475
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,931
lt will just make the dinner.

476
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:14,017
lsn't that Aunt Emma's vegetable dish?

477
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,686
Yes, isn't it lovely?

478
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,988
- This just came, Mrs. Jordan.
- Thank you, Dora.

479
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:29,950
l can still remember
when a telegram always meant bad news.

480
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,245
- Good heavens!
- You see?

481
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,498
Freddy Hope, my extra man,
he's got pneumonia.

482
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:40,210
Of all the thoughtless, selfish....
On the day of my dinner, too.

483
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:41,920
What am l going to do?

484
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,797
Why do anything?

485
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:48,302
l never could understand why
it has to be just even, male and female.

486
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,138
They're invited for dinner, not for mating.

487
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:54,975
l don't know where to find someone
who'll fit in with the Ferncliffes.

488
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,895
Nothing but a rubber plant would fit in
with the Ferncliffes.

489
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,022
Why don't you get an actor for Carlotta?

490
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,024
- An actor?
- A movie star.

491
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,817
Aren't there any movie stars around?

492
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:07,279
l've got it. Larry Renault.
He'd be too marvelous.

493
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,115
- l wonder if he's still in town.
- He was in town yesterday.

494
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:13,869
Ed, the movie hound, read me an interview
with him in last night's Telegram.

495
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:16,038
He's leaving pictures and going into a play.

496
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:17,331
And he knows Carlotta.

497
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:21,418
We met him at her place in Antibes
three years ago. He was a sensation.

498
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,505
The girls fighting to get into his car.
And on the beach...

499
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,549
well, my dear, he wore
even less than the girls.

500
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:30,177
Ed says he isn't so hot since the talkies.

501
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,262
You can't fool Ed about the pictures.

502
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:36,099
He remembers John Bunny and
Francis X. Bushman, Henry B. Walthall.

503
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:40,062
l don't suppose he'd even remember me.
l wonder where he's stopping.

504
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:44,191
- The Versailles, that's where he is.
- That's where Carlotta's staying.

505
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:47,236
- Are you sure?
- Yes. l remember the whole interview.

506
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,656
He was wearing a two-piece
dark-blue flannel lounging suit...

507
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,450
with a cunning white monogram
on his upper pocket.

508
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:57,579
Let's see, l'll put him
between Carlotta and the Packard woman.

509
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:01,041
See if you can get him first,
and let nature take its course.

510
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:05,087
l do hope he's free for tonight.

511
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,298
''Free, white, and 45,'' Ed says.

512
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,842
l'll say this for him.

513
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:13,512
ln his photographs,
he has the most heavenly profile.

514
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:17,015
- Hello. Mr. Renault, please.
- Good luck, dear.

515
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:21,186
Hello, Mr. Renault?
This is Millicent Jordan.

516
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,064
l don't suppose you'd remember me.

517
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,441
Antibes?

518
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:31,530
Yes, of course l do.

519
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:34,992
How do you do, Mrs. Jordan?

520
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,749
Dinner, tonight?

521
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,795
Let me see.

522
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,548
l'm afraid that possibly l can't.

523
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:50,924
You see....

524
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:56,096
l have another engagement, of course...

525
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,057
but l might be able to break it.

526
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,772
And Paula, my daughter, you know,
she'll be so glad to see you again.

527
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,609
l don't suppose you'd remember her
at Antibes?

528
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,903
Of course, dear lady.

529
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,072
lt sounds like a very amusing evening.

530
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:19,119
l shall certainly try to come.
At 8:00? Thanks very much.

531
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:25,083
- What do you know about that?
- Darling, please, you must come.

532
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:28,462
l don't know. l'd feel kind of like a heel.

533
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:32,007
Larry, please. lt will be such fun.

534
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,801
To be at dinner with you in my own house.

535
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:42,392
Darling, they aren't so stuffy, really.

536
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:49,816
- They'd be crazy about you.
- Sure. l mean....

537
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,154
- You know
- And, darling...

538
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:59,701
while l was dressing for dinner,
l could be thinking ''Larry will be here.''

539
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:04,832
Darling, it's so awful
not to be with you every minute.

540
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:16,844
What?

541
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:21,014
l'm awfully jealous of the play.

542
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,392
Are you really going to act in it?

543
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:26,061
My agent's bringing Baumann up here
this afternoon.

544
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,230
l might as well sign the contract.

545
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:30,899
Baumann's as good a producer
as there is, l suppose.

546
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:32,568
l'll have to sit in the audience...

547
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,862
and watch you make love
to another woman.

548
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:38,365
l hope it flops. That's what l hope.

549
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,284
The play is not much.

550
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,327
But l think l can put it over.

551
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,329
l play the only male character.

552
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:45,581
Not another man?

553
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,667
There's a small male part for a bit actor.

554
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,794
- He's a beachcomber.
- A beachcomber?

555
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:54,381
Yeah. He has one small scene,
but l dominate that.

556
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,925
l love you so.

557
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,683
May l use your comb?

558
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:11,398
- Where have you been all this time?
- Came as quick as l could.

559
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,192
Wait a minute. Where is my change?

560
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,486
Had to go to a new place.
Cost half a dollar more.

561
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:17,779
Who told you to go to a new....

562
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,173
- A little drink.
- Any reason why l shouldn't?

563
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,510
No, of course not.

564
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:42,721
Except, at Mother's tonight...

565
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:46,517
l want them to see you at your best.
Larry, don't.

566
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,061
Paula, mind your own business, will you?

567
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:51,980
- Don't talk to me like that.
- l'll do as l please.

568
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:07,037
- Darling, let's not quarrel.
- l'm sorry.

569
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,666
l'm kind of on edge today,
deciding about this play...

570
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,751
and everything.

571
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:16,004
lt's my fault. l'm a little jumpy myself.

572
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:21,635
Ernest gets back from abroad this evening.

573
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,387
Ernest?

574
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,347
Will he be there at your mother's?

575
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:26,974
Poor Ernest.

576
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,396
l'm awfully sorry for him. He's so sweet.

577
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:37,442
l can't understand yet what's happened.

578
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:41,113
Less than a month ago,
l thought l was in love with him.

579
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:44,199
You were one of those
million-dollar movie stars.

580
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:47,661
- Paula, l want to tell you something
- l know.

581
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,581
Ernest is just the sort of young man
l should marry.

582
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:54,251
And you're the sort
that girls are always warned against.

583
00:38:55,169 --> 00:39:00,215
l don't give a hoot what people say.
l know all the things you've done.

584
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,092
l know how many times
you've been married.

585
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:04,636
- l'm still married.
- l don't care.

586
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,392
l'm sick of hiding my love for you.

587
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,437
l'm sick of scheming and pretending.

588
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:18,442
Do you think l can go on with Ernest?

589
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,820
After all we've been to each other?

590
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:25,073
You don't know anything about me.

591
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:29,286
- You've known me a month.
- Larry, how can you?

592
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,832
A month. As though time were important.

593
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:39,505
lt is important.
There are other things important.

594
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:42,257
You're a kid of 19.

595
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:46,428
You're 19 and l'm 47....

596
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:48,639
l'm almost 40.

597
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:55,521
You'll be telling me next l'm not
old enough to know the facts of life.

598
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,981
You don't. Not the real facts.

599
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:01,902
You can't.
Everything has been too easy for you.

600
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:07,324
You don't know what it means
to be up against it.

601
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,660
Keep fighting them every second.

602
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,247
To pull yourself up, hand over hand...

603
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,416
while they're waiting with a knife
to cut the rope.

604
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,672
l'm not through yet. l'll show them.

605
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:24,883
lf they think l'm finished....

606
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:29,096
Larry, make sense.
What's that got to do with our love?

607
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,557
Love.

608
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,899
You want to know the truth, Paula?
l love you.

609
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,486
As much as l can love any woman.

610
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,781
But it isn't real love anymore.

611
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:51,743
There have been too many.
l've been in love a hundred times.

612
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,663
l've had three wives.

613
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,457
- You want to know about them?
- No.

614
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:05,007
There was Violet.
She was a vaudeville hoofer.

615
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:09,803
Rooming houses, dirty kimonos,
fried-egg sandwiches.

616
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:16,518
We fought like wildcats.
Then l broke into pictures and l left her.

617
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,354
Then l married Edith.

618
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:24,401
She was crazy about my profile.
Always kept talking about it.

619
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,570
She was society.

620
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,781
We were happy for about six months.

621
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:34,161
Then Hollywood dazzled her.
You know what happened.

622
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:37,831
Out in her car one night,
drunk as the devil...

623
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:40,000
over the cliff.

624
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:43,295
Were you in love with her?

625
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:49,343
As for Marcelle, you know about her.

626
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:54,223
She's the top of the heap now.
Biggest draw of any woman in pictures.

627
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:58,227
Ambitious. l've never known any woman
like her.

628
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:02,397
She'd do anything to get along,
and knife me to get there.

629
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:05,734
Always telling me someday
she'd be bigger than l was...

630
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,361
and now l'm....

631
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,123
There they are, the three of them.

632
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:24,586
l won't tell you about the others.
They swarmed on me.

633
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,214
Every age, kind, and description.

634
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:35,138
What do you want with me?

635
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:41,854
l love you.

636
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,156
You're young and fresh,
and l'm burned out.

637
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:02,624
This is the first decent thing
l ever did in my life.

638
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:05,961
You listen to what l'm telling you.

639
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,463
l won't listen. l love you.

640
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:12,092
lt's no use, Larry. Nothing you can say
will make any difference.

641
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:14,344
l'm going to tell Mother and Dad
and Ernest...

642
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:17,556
- and l'm going to tell them tonight.
- l tell you you're not!

643
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,225
That's Mac, my agent.

644
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,188
- Paula, l want you to promise me.
- No!

645
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,856
For the love of heaven, Paula.

646
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,734
lt's no use, Larry. My mind's made up.

647
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:35,699
Don't you ever get up?

648
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:45,751
You know my agent, Mr. Kane?
Miss Jordan.

649
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:49,046
- Sure. How is the little lady?
- Splendid, thank you. You?

650
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:51,924
Top of the bottle. Am l butting in?

651
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:54,885
Not at all. l was just going. Goodbye.

652
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:56,720
Pearls in your oysters.

653
00:43:56,803 --> 00:44:00,098
Paula, please think of what l've said.

654
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,272
Oh, dear.

655
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:10,192
- Goodbye, Larry.
- Goodbye.

656
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,487
- Paula.
- l must, Larry.

657
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,167
Now, aren't you ashamed?

658
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:30,921
For 15 minutes, l walk you
around the block so you....

659
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:33,507
And then you come right in here....

660
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:37,219
Momsy's sorry.

661
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:40,639
She doesn't give a darn
for the old man's carpet.

662
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:42,683
No, l'm awfully sorry.

663
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:50,190
How is the great profile today?

664
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,277
You been out or sticking around here?

665
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,654
No. l didn't feel very well.

666
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:58,532
l slept rather late. l'm going out to dinner.

667
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:01,618
Why don't you go up to McDermott's
and get a workout every day?

668
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:05,414
Get yourself in shape.
What is this, cinnamon toast?

669
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:10,752
l'll be all right. As soon as l get
into rehearsal, l'll get into shape.

670
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,214
Sure, just keep on with that.

671
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,216
That'll fix you up.

672
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:24,600
Did you see Baumann? l thought perhaps
he'd come up here with you.

673
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:26,810
Baumann?

674
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:31,315
No. He didn't come up.

675
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,985
Did he give you the contract?

676
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:36,612
Look, Larry...

677
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,742
l got some disappointing news for you,
kind of.

678
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:43,577
What's the matter?

679
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,500
You know how these managers are.
This way, that way.

680
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,252
You never know when you got them.
Well....

681
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:55,797
For the love of.... Come out with it.

682
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:57,299
l'm telling you.

683
00:45:57,382 --> 00:46:00,052
l go in to see Baumann this afternoon.

684
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:03,263
He's sitting there, a face down to here.

685
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:07,559
l start talking about the play.
What does he do?

686
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:11,146
He tells me he's got to go south
for a month. He's sick.

687
00:46:12,189 --> 00:46:14,233
What does that mean?

688
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,901
There you are.

689
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,694
He's got to go south.

690
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:20,739
You can't do a play when you're south.

691
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:23,617
But he's got to do it. lt was all settled.

692
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:27,788
lt was talked over, but it wasn't really....

693
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,543
You know. Unless you get it down
in that old black and white....

694
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,838
Even then sometimes it's no good.

695
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:39,299
We'll take it away from him.
There are other producers.

696
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:42,135
The cheap crook.

697
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:46,682
Sure. Baumann's no good.

698
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:51,520
That's how he got where he is.

699
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,025
But that's not the point. What does he do?

700
00:46:57,442 --> 00:47:01,321
He goes and he turns the play over
to this Joe Stengel.

701
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:10,956
l rather like the idea of going with Stengel.

702
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:14,585
They tell me he does
those highbrow plays. lbsen.

703
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:20,257
- ''l want the moon, Mother.''
- Yeah. Now, look Larry.

704
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,260
He understands
l'm to be starred, of course.

705
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:27,347
- That's just it.
- What?

706
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:31,518
Now, look, Larry. Don't blame me.
l've been plugging for you for months.

707
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:33,103
What are you trying to tell me?

708
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:35,647
Don't go up in the air about it.

709
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:38,442
There's sure to be something else.

710
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:39,902
You mean l'm out?

711
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:43,405
You dirty double-crosser.
Do you mean l'm out?

712
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:47,284
Larry, l'm telling you,
nobody knew about this. Nobody.

713
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:52,206
Who's going to play the part?

714
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:54,583
This Cecil Bellamy.

715
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:59,213
That piffling little....
He's English in the first place.

716
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:02,591
The part says ''English Explorer.''

717
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:07,596
l can be English. English as anybody.

718
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,973
l've been waiting six weeks for this play.

719
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,600
l could've had a million things.

720
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:13,894
Personal appearances, radio, vaudeville

721
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,772
Sure you could. You can get them yet.

722
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,525
But the thing for you is a part in a play.

723
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:22,444
You know, get back in that old public eye.

724
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:24,655
Yes, but where's the vehicle?

725
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,157
l was thinking about this play again...

726
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:30,702
and you know, Larry,
l never said anything...

727
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,331
but l never thought
that part was so hot for you.

728
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:39,378
You know the part that l'd be crazy to play
if l was an actor?

729
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:42,297
- What?
- That beachcomber.

730
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:46,718
Beachcomber?

731
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:51,807
You're asking me to go on...

732
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:55,811
and play a part that isn't....

733
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:01,608
Get out of here. Go on. Get out.

734
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:03,986
Larry, don't make a mistake.

735
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:06,822
Get out before l kick you out.

736
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,246
Have it your own way.

737
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:25,215
Wait a minute.

738
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:31,013
Close the door.

739
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:44,359
What makes you think
this part isn't right for me?

740
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:47,362
lt's no good.
They're going to get tired of him.

741
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:50,407
Now, this beachcomber.
He comes on once.

742
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:53,285
Swell scene. He goes off.

743
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:57,456
They keep waiting for him to come back,
and he never does.

744
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:58,957
What a part.

745
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:03,170
- Yes, his one scene is very nice.
- lt's a pushover.

746
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:06,632
You know what's gonna happen?
When that final curtain hits the floor...

747
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:10,427
and what's his name, this Bellamy,
when he comes out to take his bows...

748
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:13,639
they're all gonna be yelling,
''Renault! Renault! ''

749
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:15,474
- You think so?
- lt's a pushover.

750
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:18,727
l tell you what. l'm going to see Stengel.
He's a friend of mine.

751
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,730
Wait a minute.
Don't let on you talked to me about this.

752
00:50:21,814 --> 00:50:24,358
Just tell him maybe you can get me
to play it.

753
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:25,859
Leave it to me.

754
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:29,112
l might be able to get Stengel
to drop up here as a favor to me.

755
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:32,074
l used to be Joe's office boy.

756
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:34,117
How long you going to be here?

757
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:37,246
A long while. l'm not dining till 8:00.

758
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:41,959
lf l can get him to come up, l'm good.

759
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:45,921
- Goodbye.
- Mac.

760
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:52,094
Here's a funny thing.
l wonder if you could let me have $5.

761
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:55,347
Taxi fare. l didn't get down to the bank.

762
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:59,351
l'm going to this dinner tonight
and what do you suppose l got?

763
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:03,021
Seven cents.

764
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:06,733
lmagine that.

765
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:10,946
Look, l just got enough
to go down to the office myself...

766
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:13,824
but l'll bring it to you when l come back.

767
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,595
Come in.

768
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,933
Can l take the table now?

769
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,143
Waiter.

770
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:47,816
lt just occurred to me, l haven't had
anything to eat since breakfast.

771
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,943
l'm not dining until 8:00.

772
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:54,865
Bring me up a cup of coffee.
Good and strong.

773
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:58,702
And l think l'll take a caviar sandwich.

774
00:51:58,785 --> 00:51:59,828
Yes, sir.

775
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,289
That's all.

776
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:06,251
l'm very sorry, Mr. Renault,
but were you going to sign for it?

777
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:07,586
Why?

778
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:09,463
Excuse me, but my orders are...

779
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:13,342
if you sign for it,
l cannot serve any more food here.

780
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,055
Not serve?

781
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:23,685
Get that order up here at once.
l'll speak to the manager. Get it up.

782
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:41,245
Hello? No, l didn't call.

783
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:46,041
Hello. Wait a minute. Yes, l did.

784
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:52,214
Send up a bellboy to go on an errand.

785
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:56,677
Send up Eddie.

786
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,763
The one who always goes out for me.

787
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:13,253
There's six in the waiting room.

788
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:15,339
Mr. Jordan wants to know
if you'll see him.

789
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:16,507
l suppose so.

790
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,926
Did you see Mrs. Talbot?
She wanted to talk to you.

791
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:20,260
No, l didn't.

792
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:26,558
Dr. Talbot's office. Who is it, please?

793
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:29,394
Who is it?

794
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,106
l'm sorry, but l'll have to have a name.

795
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:39,029
Yes, Mrs. Packard. He's in. Just a minute.

796
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:45,619
Doctor, Mrs. Packard's
on your private wire.

797
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,665
All right.

798
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:01,468
Hello.

799
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:03,554
Yes.

800
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:10,769
Now, Kitty.

801
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,149
Kitty, listen....
Kitty, would you listen a minute?

802
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:18,402
No, l can't come over.

803
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:21,572
These are my office hours, you know that.

804
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,658
There's nothing the matter with you.

805
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,369
l've been busy.

806
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:29,746
l'll see you tonight at the Jordans'.

807
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:32,457
Of course you can go.

808
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:37,588
Of course l do. l think you're very sweet.

809
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:42,259
No. Of course there's no other woman.

810
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:44,636
Now, Kitty, you're driving me....

811
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:49,766
Yes, l think you better
sleep for an hour and rest...

812
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,060
and then take a mild bromide.

813
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:56,064
My office is full of patients now.
You must excuse me.

814
00:55:56,607 --> 00:55:59,818
No. There's no cause for alarm. Goodbye.

815
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,531
Hello, Lucy.

816
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:06,033
Hello, Wayne.

817
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:08,911
How are you, dear?

818
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:11,079
l'm fine. And you?

819
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:13,332
l'm all right.

820
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:16,335
- Anything new?
- No.

821
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:19,630
Just the same old thing.

822
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:21,673
What?

823
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:23,967
l mean, unreasonable women patients.

824
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:27,012
Yes. She's not really sick.

825
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:29,348
Women with a lot of time on their hands.

826
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:32,809
l prescribed a sedative,
but she doesn't really need anything.

827
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:34,895
How about an apple a day?

828
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,773
What's that?

829
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:39,483
Don't bother.

830
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:40,943
What?

831
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:44,530
Don't bother because l know all about it.

832
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:48,075
What are you talking about?

833
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:51,495
Wayne, dear, l'm not going
to make a scene.

834
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:53,622
You know l never do, do l?

835
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:56,500
Remember how nicely
l behaved about the others?

836
00:56:57,334 --> 00:57:00,629
Mrs. Whiting and that Dalrimple girl...

837
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:04,466
and the Ferguson woman, Dolly, and....

838
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,594
Where are your files?

839
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:10,389
You're quite wrong.

840
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:12,808
Now, dear, l knew just when it started.

841
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:15,435
Now she's at the insistent stage.

842
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:21,650
lt's all just a great bore, isn't it, darling?

843
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:27,281
Don't think l don't mind.

844
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:33,078
But l can't let it tear me to pieces
the way it did the first time.

845
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:37,499
lt was just before
Wayne was born, remember?

846
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:42,296
l thought the world had come to an end.

847
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:47,551
The noble young physician...

848
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:50,262
was just a masher.

849
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:54,600
Surely a little more than that.

850
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:57,352
A great deal more.

851
00:57:57,978 --> 00:58:00,147
That's why it's so pathetic.

852
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:02,816
You're two people, really.

853
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,486
One's magnificent...

854
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:09,323
and the other's so shoddy.

855
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,369
You're right, Lucy.

856
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:19,208
l don't know why
you've stayed with me all these years.

857
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:23,462
Because l'm still in love with you.
lsn't that funny?

858
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:25,839
You'd think l'd have more pride.

859
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:31,553
l love you, Lucy. lt's never been otherwise.

860
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:34,431
You know what l think?

861
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:39,394
l think you're still a little boy
living over on Tenth Avenue...

862
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:42,815
a little bit in awe
of the girl from Murray Hill.

863
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,734
And that's why, forgive me...

864
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:48,904
these glamorous women in your life...

865
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:53,575
have all been a little common,
a little bit Tenth Avenue, too.

866
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:58,539
These other women, why....

867
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:03,293
lt's like gambling, drinking, or drugs.
You just keep on.

868
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:08,090
A habit can be cured
if the patient wants to.

869
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:11,969
The patient wants to.

870
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,265
Of course, you mustn't stop too suddenly.

871
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:22,896
Lucy, darling, it's you and l.

872
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,776
lt's always been you and l,
and always will be.

873
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:30,904
Now, you must believe that.

874
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,333
Doctor....

875
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:47,129
l'm sorry. Mr. Oliver Jordan's here,
and he seems very ill.

876
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:48,422
Have him come right in.

877
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:50,757
- l'll see you later, dear.
- All right, dear.

878
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:55,137
- You're all right now, Mr. Jordan.
- Why, what's this, Oliver?

879
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:58,390
Here, come right over here and sit down.

880
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,226
- Take it easy now.
- Come on. Come quietly.

881
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,563
That's right. There you are now.

882
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,357
That's it.

883
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:11,153
- lt's right here.
- Nitrate of Ammo, quick.

884
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:20,954
Here. Sniff this.

885
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:28,837
There. That's better.

886
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:31,089
l'm all right now.

887
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:00,452
How long has this been going on?
Have you ever had it before?

888
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:03,038
No. Not exactly like this.

889
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:07,251
lt's probably indigestion.
What did you have for lunch?

890
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:09,253
l didn't have much of anything.

891
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:12,548
l'd like you to come in tomorrow
for a more thorough examination.

892
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:15,217
All right. 2:15?

893
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,928
l'll be at the hospital till 4:00
so you better make it 4:15.

894
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,346
All right.

895
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,769
l feel great.

896
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:29,439
l may fool you
and not come at all tomorrow.

897
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:30,732
You show up here.

898
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:33,569
Broken appointments are charged double.

899
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:35,779
l never pay them anyhow.

900
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:38,323
What are you doing tonight, Oliver?

901
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:39,950
You're dining with us.

902
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:41,243
That's right.

903
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:44,246
Couldn't you arrange to sneak away
and go to bed early?

904
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,123
We're going to the theater.

905
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:49,001
Now, you avoid any excitement...

906
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:51,336
and stop worrying about business.

907
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:55,507
- Old pump out of order?
- No. lt's a bit weary.

908
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:57,968
- Just a little tired, that's all.
- l see.

909
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:01,054
- See you later. Dinner at 8:00?
- l believe so.

910
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:02,848
- Goodbye, Oliver.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

911
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,517
- Thank you very much.
- lt's all right.

912
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:11,106
You're not fooling me.

913
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:26,079
How bad is it?

914
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:28,874
Coronary artery. Thrombosis.

915
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,835
How long will he live?

916
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:35,005
A few years, months...

917
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:37,841
days, even.

918
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,511
Are you sure?

919
01:02:40,594 --> 01:02:42,763
Positive. You can tell it like that.

920
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:45,307
Poor fellow.

921
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,603
Yeah.

922
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:58,612
- Ready?
- All right.

923
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:05,828
All right, Mrs. Bedwick.

924
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:16,088
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes, Mrs. Wendel?

925
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,465
Why, what's the matter with your face?

926
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:20,717
lt's that old tooth again.

927
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:22,886
What seems to be wrong?

928
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,389
lt's the aspic for the dinner tonight.

929
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:27,141
The aspic?

930
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:31,812
l had to drop it on the floor.

931
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:36,150
- You had to drop the aspic on the floor?
- Yes, ma'am.

932
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:40,362
You see, the butler
and the chauffeur were fighting...

933
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:43,991
and l had to get between them.

934
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:46,743
Ricky and Gustave fighting?

935
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:49,496
- What about?
- Dora.

936
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:51,456
Dora?

937
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,043
What do they mean
by fighting in the kitchen?

938
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:56,461
l don't know, ma'am.

939
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:59,006
But we can't use the aspic
for dinner tonight.

940
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,300
Of course not,
if you dropped it on the floor.

941
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:03,218
5:00. This is terrible.

942
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:06,722
l particularly wanted the aspic.
lt's so dressy.

943
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:09,766
Send for some crabmeat.
You can cook it Newburg.

944
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:12,227
- Yes, ma'am.
- Send Ricky for it at once.

945
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:14,980
But l can't send Ricky, ma'am.

946
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:16,398
Why not?

947
01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:20,569
You see, he's been arrested. He's in jail.

948
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,614
- Excuse me, madam.
- ln jail? For what?

949
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:26,700
For stabbing Gustave.

950
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:29,661
Excuse me, madam.
Miss Carlotta Vance is calling.

951
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:31,413
Tell her l'm not here.

952
01:04:31,497 --> 01:04:33,332
Where is Gustave?

953
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:36,126
You see, they took him to the hospital.

954
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:38,504
The doctor's sewing up his eye.

955
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:40,005
Millicent.

956
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:43,258
- Oh, dear.
- Where are you?

957
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:46,303
- ln here, Carlotta.
- Will that be about all, ma'am?

958
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:48,764
- l hope so.
-Thank you, ma'am.

959
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:52,100
Millicent. Ducky.

960
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:56,188
l never was so glad to see anyone
in all my life, my dear.

961
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:59,983
- Dear Carlotta.
- You don't mind me rushing in on you?

962
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:03,111
- l just popped in to see Oliver.
- Really? How nice.

963
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:04,988
- l'm afraid
- No, l'll wait.

964
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:06,740
Anything to get out of those streets.

965
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:09,660
May l have a whiskey and soda?
You don't mind, do you?

966
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,662
Millicent, really, l'm just dying.

967
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:15,415
- Why, of course.
- Oh, my. l'm absolutely cracked up.

968
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:17,292
Yeah. Simply depleted.

969
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:21,880
l've been in every office building
from the Battery to the Bronx.

970
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:26,009
Millicent, you don't mind
if l take my shoes off, do you?

971
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,637
What a relief.

972
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:31,640
Oh, me. Oh, my.

973
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:34,059
No. Please do.

974
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:37,146
Thank you. lt's that big toe.

975
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:45,404
What a city.
l left the hotel at 11:00 this morning...

976
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:49,241
a young and lovely girl. Now look at me.

977
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:54,163
l took on 10 years trying to get
from the Versailles to Times Square.

978
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:59,293
And then l had a restful, nice luncheon
with four lawyers.

979
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,839
On the 88th floor
of the what's-it building, the Sky Club.

980
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:06,884
A cloud floated right into my soup plate.

981
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:10,137
Yes, it's terrible, but we get used to it.

982
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,432
The minute l see Oliver,
l'm going back to my hotel...

983
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:17,394
and pop myself into bed, and l'm not
going to get up until tomorrow at noon.

984
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:21,273
Thank goodness l don't have to go
to one of those dreadful dinners tonight.

985
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:24,234
But you're dining here.

986
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,365
How enchanting.

987
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:33,660
Of course! The Ferncliffes.

988
01:06:33,744 --> 01:06:37,623
That means
a nice little cozy game of bridge.

989
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:41,460
l can always keep awake for that.

990
01:06:41,585 --> 01:06:43,504
But we're going to the theater.

991
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:47,090
Now, won't that be delightful?

992
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:50,177
Yes. l always like to see a new play.

993
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,262
What are we going to see?

994
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:54,515
We're going to see Say lt With Music.

995
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:57,309
Yeah. That will be enchanting.

996
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:59,812
Yes. l thought it was so amusing.

997
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:02,272
What? You've seen it?

998
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,359
Yes. Two or three times.

999
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:07,277
That's nothing.

1000
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,822
No. l'm used to that.

1001
01:07:11,615 --> 01:07:15,118
Funny man. With a cigar.

1002
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:20,666
Should l mix it for you, madam?

1003
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:24,336
Thank you very much, my dear.
That'd be very nice of you.

1004
01:07:24,503 --> 01:07:27,631
Oh, dear, let me see.

1005
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:30,801
Now, that's enough.

1006
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:33,470
How complicated life is.

1007
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,975
lf ever.... No, my dear.
Wait a minute. Don't spoil it.

1008
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:56,493
- Oliver.
- Oliver, ducky.

1009
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:58,495
Hello, Carlotta.

1010
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,750
- Carlotta.
- Carlotta wants to talk to you.

1011
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:07,880
- l'll not keep you a minute.
- l've got to get a new butler for tonight.

1012
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:11,133
l do hope the agency will send me one
who doesn't drop things.

1013
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:12,467
Optimist.

1014
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,387
lf it's not asking too much.

1015
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:22,603
l tried to get you.... Oliver, sweet.

1016
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:26,732
You won't be cross with Carlotta,
will you? l told the man...

1017
01:08:26,815 --> 01:08:30,819
that l wanted to ask you first,
but he said, ''No, it must done today.''

1018
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:35,699
A meeting or something. Then l couldn't
reach you at your office and l went ahead.

1019
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:38,160
Then l sort of got worried about it.

1020
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:40,954
Carlotta, what are you trying to tell me?

1021
01:08:41,038 --> 01:08:45,209
You see, Oliver, sweet,
you know, Carlotta's so broke.

1022
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:50,255
lt was such a chance,
and l sold my Jordan stock.

1023
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,426
l hope you won't mind.
That's what l came here to tell you.

1024
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,969
Who did you sell it to?

1025
01:08:56,053 --> 01:09:00,307
A most charming man.
He had such nice manners.

1026
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:04,645
Let's see.
His name is ''James K. Baldridge.''

1027
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:10,901
- l hope you don't mind.
- No. lt's all right.

1028
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:15,030
Oliver, l did try to reach you.

1029
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:26,625
You know, you said
you didn't want to buy it back yourself.

1030
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:30,838
Along came that nice Mr. Beanbridge
with all that beautiful money.

1031
01:09:30,921 --> 01:09:34,216
- See, it's certified.
- Hello. Mr. Kingsbury.

1032
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:35,634
Oliver Jordan speaking.

1033
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:39,638
You are cross. l'm just devastated.

1034
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:41,932
l wouldn't have done it
for anything in the world.

1035
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,726
- l'd rather go barefoot and hungry
- Kingsbury?

1036
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:48,730
Sorry to disturb you at home.

1037
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:52,317
Have the Scatterlee sisters
sold their Jordan stock?

1038
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:56,155
You sold it this afternoon.

1039
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:59,658
Would you mind telling me who bought it?

1040
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,621
Baldridge. Thank you very much.

1041
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:13,088
l guess l'll be trotting along.
l'll see you at dinner.

1042
01:10:13,755 --> 01:10:15,799
Say goodbye to Millicent for me,
won't you?

1043
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:18,844
No. l'll see you to the door, Carlotta.

1044
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:34,234
Hello. Yes. This is Mrs. Jordan.

1045
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:38,697
Lord Ferncliffe's secretary.

1046
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:40,991
Yes?

1047
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:50,626
What's that? But you must be mistaken.

1048
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:55,172
But they can't. They can't go to Florida.

1049
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:59,176
They are coming here to dinner.
l'm giving the dinner for them.

1050
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:02,930
They've gone. When?

1051
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,892
But people don't do such things.
l don't care how sudden it was.

1052
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:09,061
You should have let me....

1053
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:14,191
All l can say is, l never heard
of such a thing in all my life before.

1054
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:19,196
- Mother, l want to talk to you.
- What?

1055
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:21,532
lt's about Ernest and me.
l want to talk to you

1056
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:24,827
Paula, don't bother me now,
for pity's sake.

1057
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:28,080
- l can't listen to your
- But, Mother, you don't understand.

1058
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:30,749
- This is terribly important.
- Paula, shut up, l tell you.

1059
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:32,292
Let me think.

1060
01:11:33,168 --> 01:11:37,381
Millicent, would you mind awfully
if l didn't go to the theater tonight?

1061
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:39,383
l'm feeling pretty rotten.

1062
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:42,302
- lf l could just go to bed
- What's that you're saying?

1063
01:11:42,386 --> 01:11:46,056
l'm feeling pretty rotten.
l'm up against a business thing.

1064
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:50,894
A business thing. At a time like this,
you talk to me about a business thing...

1065
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:52,479
and feeling rotten.

1066
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:55,149
This is a nice time to say
you're feeling rotten.

1067
01:11:55,232 --> 01:11:58,652
You come to me with your....
And you whimpering about Ernest.

1068
01:11:58,735 --> 01:12:00,154
Some little lovers' quarrel.

1069
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:02,990
l'm expected to listen to Ernest, business,
and headaches...

1070
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:04,408
when l'm half out of my mind.

1071
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:06,410
Do you know what's happened to me?

1072
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:09,496
l've had the most ghastly day
anybody ever had.

1073
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,665
No aspic for dinner...

1074
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:14,585
and Ricky in jail
and Gustave dying, for all l know...

1075
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:17,254
and a new butler tonight,
and that Vance woman coming in.

1076
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:19,214
And having to send for crabmeat.

1077
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:20,632
Crabmeat!

1078
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:23,468
And now, on top of everything else...

1079
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:27,556
the Ferncliffes aren't coming to dinner.

1080
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:30,684
They call up at this hour,
the miserable cockneys.

1081
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:33,687
They call up to say they've gone to Florida.

1082
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:37,065
Who can l get at this hour? Nobody.
l've got eight people for dinner.

1083
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:39,109
Eight people isn't a dinner. Who can l get?

1084
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:44,156
You come to me with your idiotic little....
l am the one who ought to be in bed.

1085
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:45,949
l'm the one who's in trouble.

1086
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:49,036
You don't know what trouble is,
either of you!

1087
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:05,552
How you coming, kitten?

1088
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:09,389
How you coming, kitten?

1089
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:11,141
l've told you a million times...

1090
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:13,769
not to talk to me
when l'm doing my lashes.

1091
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:16,688
And don't you talk to me
when l'm shaving.

1092
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:21,527
l think these are the handsomest ones
you ever bought.

1093
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:24,738
Will you take those back?
l'll tell you when l want them.

1094
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:27,115
Put them in the icebox, nitwit.

1095
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:33,747
Tomorrow, Oliver Jordan can go
and buy himself a little rowboat...

1096
01:13:33,831 --> 01:13:36,959
and start all over again.
He'll never know who done it.

1097
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:39,670
You're so smart,
you're going to land in jail some day.

1098
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:42,005
Tina, where are my slippers?

1099
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:44,883
l'm just beginning, tootsie.

1100
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:48,762
Whose wife's got any bigger bracelets
than you've got?

1101
01:13:48,846 --> 01:13:50,430
Remember what l told you last week?

1102
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:52,599
l don't remember
what you told me a minute ago.

1103
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:55,144
About Washington.
Don't you remember that?

1104
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,022
How'd you like to be
a cabinet member's wife?

1105
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:02,943
Mingle with all the other Cabinet
members' wives and ambassadors'?

1106
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:04,069
Nerts.

1107
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:07,114
You're not going to drag me down
to that graveyard.

1108
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:10,242
l've seen their pictures in the papers,
those girlies.

1109
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:13,579
A lot of sour-faced frumps
with last year's clothes on.

1110
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:17,291
Pinning medals on Girl Scouts
and pouring tea for the DARs...

1111
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:20,002
and rolling Easter eggs
on the White House lawn.

1112
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:23,380
A swell lot of fun l'd have.
You go live in Washington.

1113
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:25,757
l can have a good time right here.

1114
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:27,134
Listen, stupid.

1115
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:32,097
lf l get that appointment to Washington,
l'm going. And if l go, you go. That's that.

1116
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:36,268
- You mean you're really going to get it?
- Certainly l am.

1117
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:39,354
- l won't go.
- You will go!

1118
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:43,817
No, l won't! You can't boss me.
l can yell just as loud as you can.

1119
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:47,029
You've been acting very strangely lately,
my fine lady...

1120
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:48,780
and l'm not going to stand for it.

1121
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:50,157
Yeah. And so what?

1122
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:54,578
So what? l'm the works around here
and l'll give you orders what to do.

1123
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:57,831
Who do you think you're talking to,
your first wife out in Montana?

1124
01:14:57,915 --> 01:14:59,249
Now, you leave her out of this.

1125
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,503
That poor thing with a flat chest
that didn't have nerve enough...

1126
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:05,297
to talk up to you,
washing your greasy overalls, cooking...

1127
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,342
and slaving in some lousy mining shack?
No wonder she died.

1128
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:10,969
- l'll sock you in a minute.
- You can't get me that way.

1129
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:15,766
You're not going to step on my face to get
where you want to go, you big windbag!

1130
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:18,477
Listen, you little piece of scum, you....

1131
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,855
l've got a good notion to drop you
right back where l picked you up:

1132
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:24,274
in the checkroom of the Hottentot Club...

1133
01:15:24,358 --> 01:15:26,485
- or whatever the dirty joint was.
- No, you won't!

1134
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:30,155
And then you can go back
to that sweet-smelling family of yours...

1135
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:33,408
back of the railroad tracks in Passaic.
And get this.

1136
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:37,621
lf that sniveling, money-grubbing,
whining old mother of yours...

1137
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:41,542
comes fooling around my offices anymore,
l'm going to give orders...

1138
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:45,712
to have her thrown down
those 60 flights of stairs, so help me!

1139
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:48,006
Give me that!

1140
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:55,347
- You pick that up.
- Pick it up yourself.

1141
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:57,182
You pick that up!

1142
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:03,772
Bracelets, eh?

1143
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:14,199
After l pick you out of the gutter,
this is the thanks that l get.

1144
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,285
Thank you.

1145
01:16:18,203 --> 01:16:19,329
Thanks for what?

1146
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:23,167
Listening to you about what a big guy
you just been or you gonna be?

1147
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:26,461
Listen. You never sent me a flower
in your life.

1148
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:28,714
When l want flowers, l gotta go buy them.

1149
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:31,175
What woman wants to
buy theirselves flowers?

1150
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:35,220
You never talk to me, or ask me what
l've been doing, or how l am, or anything.

1151
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:38,891
Why don't you get something to do?
l ain't stopping you.

1152
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:40,476
You bet you ain't.

1153
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:43,520
You think l sit home all day,
looking at bracelets.

1154
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:45,355
Of all the dumb bunnies.

1155
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,984
What do you think l'm doing
while you're out pulling your dirty deals?

1156
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:51,028
Waiting for Daddy to come home?

1157
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:52,779
What are you driving at

1158
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,991
You think you're the only man l know,
you great, big noise?

1159
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:58,785
You aren't, see?
There's somebody that just knowing him...

1160
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:01,163
has made me realize
what a stuffed shirt you are.

1161
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:03,749
You don't like that, do you,
Mr. Cabinet Member?

1162
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:05,459
Somebody else put over a deal.

1163
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:08,378
You've been putting it over on me
with some other man?

1164
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:11,882
Yes, and what are you going
to do about it, you big gasbag?

1165
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:15,260
You tell me who it is,
or l'll break every bone in your body.

1166
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:17,221
You can kill me, and l won't.

1167
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:21,350
l'll find out who it is.

1168
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:24,603
- Tini!
- She don't know.

1169
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:35,239
Who's been coming to this house?

1170
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:37,908
- You don't know, do you?
- You shut your trap!

1171
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:41,286
- Who's been coming to this house?
- l ain't seen nobody.

1172
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,621
Yes, you have!

1173
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:46,625
You tell me, who came here
while l was in Washington?

1174
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,877
Nobody. Only the doctor.

1175
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:51,171
No, l don't mean him.

1176
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:54,132
Who's been coming here behind my back?

1177
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:55,717
l ain't seen a soul.

1178
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:58,595
Get out, you dummy.

1179
01:18:00,097 --> 01:18:01,849
What did l tell you?

1180
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:08,063
l'll divorce you. That's what l'll do.
You won't get one cent.

1181
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:11,942
- There's a law for what you've done.
- Yeah, you got to prove it first.

1182
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:14,945
Yeah? l'll track him down.
l'll find him, and l'll kill him.

1183
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:16,113
That's what l'll do.

1184
01:18:16,196 --> 01:18:20,159
Then l'll throw you out
just like you were an alley cat.

1185
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:24,079
Yeah? So you want to go to Washington.

1186
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:26,540
You want to tell the President
where to get off.

1187
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:28,333
You want to go into politics.

1188
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:32,629
l know about politics, and l know all about
the crooked deals you bragged about.

1189
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:36,592
Stealing from Brown, the Thompson
business, and gypping old man Clarke...

1190
01:18:36,675 --> 01:18:37,843
and now this Jordan thing.

1191
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:41,096
When l tell about those,
it will raise a pretty stink.

1192
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:46,351
Politics? You couldn't get into politics.
You couldn't get in anywhere.

1193
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:49,438
You couldn't even get in the men's room
at the Astor.

1194
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:54,860
Why, you poisonous
little rattlesnake, you....

1195
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:59,072
Listen. l've got to go
to this Ferncliffe dinner tonight.

1196
01:18:59,156 --> 01:19:02,242
Ferncliffe means more to me than you do.

1197
01:19:02,326 --> 01:19:04,828
l'm clearing out of here after tonight.

1198
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:09,416
You can sit here and get flowers
from your soul mate. We're through.

1199
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,959
No, you ain't!

1200
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:14,796
Now you're going to listen to me
while l run off at the mouth.

1201
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,509
You're going to let that Jordan stock
stay right where it is...

1202
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:23,055
because if you don't,
l'll broadcast the whole rotten deal.

1203
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:26,642
And if l open my trap,
they can hear me clean back in Montana.

1204
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:29,853
lt's the first chance l ever got
with decent society people...

1205
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:33,065
to see my name in the paper
with somebody that ain't mixed...

1206
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:37,611
in your dirty politics, and if l miss it,
you'll pay for it with everything you got.

1207
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:41,865
- So you'd make a sucker out of me?
- l certainly ain't trying to make...

1208
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:46,286
a gentleman out of you,
but l'm gonna be a lady if it kills me.

1209
01:19:46,578 --> 01:19:49,998
- Why, you dirty little
- Don't say it.

1210
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,627
So-and-so.

1211
01:19:57,214 --> 01:19:58,924
- Tina.
- Yes, ma'am?

1212
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:02,261
Pick that bracelet up. lt fell.

1213
01:20:05,222 --> 01:20:07,933
- My, it's pretty, ain't it?
- Give it to me.

1214
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,477
Look, it just fits me.

1215
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:15,691
Give it here, will you?

1216
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:17,901
You got so many bracelets.

1217
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:20,529
l don't see how you can use them all.

1218
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:24,533
What are you driving at?

1219
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:29,538
Nothing. Only, l thought
with you having so many...

1220
01:20:31,165 --> 01:20:33,709
maybe you might want to give me one.

1221
01:21:20,172 --> 01:21:21,381
Come in.

1222
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:26,136
Where have you been?
You know l was waiting here, you silly

1223
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,763
Larry, l brought up Mr. Stengel.

1224
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:31,767
This is Larry Renault, Mr. Stengel.
Larry, this is Joe Stengel.

1225
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:34,853
- How do you do, Mr. Stengel?
- Mr. Renault.

1226
01:21:35,187 --> 01:21:39,107
This is quite an occasion.
The meeting of two celebrities.

1227
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:42,277
- We should have the newsreel men here.
- Yes.

1228
01:21:42,653 --> 01:21:45,781
Of course l didn't realize
it was a full-dress affair.

1229
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,658
l just came as l was.

1230
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:52,621
Mr. Renault has got a dinner date
with some of his Park Avenue friends.

1231
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:56,708
You know, these big picture boys,
they're pretty social.

1232
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:59,211
Yes. l've heard. Look, Mr. Renault.

1233
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:01,129
l haven't got an awful lot of time.

1234
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:03,507
Larry, suppose we get down
to brass tacks.

1235
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,300
All right, my dear fellow.

1236
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:09,096
Stengel, you're going
to produce this play...

1237
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:11,098
and you want me to act in it?

1238
01:22:11,598 --> 01:22:13,934
- Well, l
- Larry, this is just getting acquainted.

1239
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:16,103
He's just crazy to play the part.

1240
01:22:16,186 --> 01:22:18,647
Just a minute. Let's get this thing straight.

1241
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:23,610
l understand from Mr. Kane here
that you wanted to know if l'd be willing...

1242
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:25,737
to portray the beachcomber in this thing.

1243
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:28,615
- Wait a minute. Not so fast there.
- Now, Larry.

1244
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:32,953
ln the first place, if l consent
to play this part, and l don't say l will...

1245
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:34,955
it will have to be built up.

1246
01:22:35,038 --> 01:22:38,417
Built up? The fellow's got one scene...

1247
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,669
and they find him dead on the beach.

1248
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:43,046
This isn't a play about spiritualism.

1249
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:45,424
Don't forget, l'm Larry Renault.

1250
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:47,301
- Larry, for heaven's sake!
- Shut up!

1251
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:51,680
Now, listen, Stengel.
l'm a name, and l know it, and so do you.

1252
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:56,477
And l'm not going on to play
second fiddle to any cheap English ham.

1253
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:00,439
$8,000 a week. That's what l got,
and l was going to get $10,000...

1254
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:02,232
till the talkies came in.

1255
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:07,321
So don't think you're doing me a favor
by asking me to play in your ratty show...

1256
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:09,448
because l'm doing you one.

1257
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:12,618
l think maybe we're keeping you
from your dinner, Mr. Renault.

1258
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,912
- Joe, he doesn't mean
- Yes, l do!

1259
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:18,957
And just because it's Mr. Joe Stengel,
it don't mean a thing to me.

1260
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:22,503
l'm still good, better than l ever was.

1261
01:23:22,836 --> 01:23:24,379
Good night, Mr. Renault.

1262
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:28,550
Listen to me, old-timer.
l'm drunk, and l know l'm drunk...

1263
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:31,845
but l know what l'm talking about.

1264
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:33,388
For heaven's sake, Mr. Stengel.

1265
01:23:33,472 --> 01:23:35,098
lt's all right. l'll see you tomorrow.

1266
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:39,019
l wouldn't be in your rotten show.
Not Larry Renault. You know why?

1267
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:43,982
Because l'm an important artist,
and you're a cheap pushcart producer.

1268
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:46,819
Pushcart!

1269
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:15,472
You cockeyed, drunken fool.
l bring him up here.

1270
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:20,352
l go down on my hands and knees to do it.
And you! You....

1271
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:29,611
Well, that's that.

1272
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:36,577
Wait a minute.

1273
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:40,706
l got something to say to you, too.

1274
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:44,376
Telling him l was crazy to play the part.

1275
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:48,505
You got this play away from Baumann
and you gave it to Stengel...

1276
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:50,757
you double-dealing chiseler.

1277
01:24:50,841 --> 01:24:55,262
l've been suspicious of you all along.
You're in with the managers.

1278
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:58,515
You've been taking my money
and working for them.

1279
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:02,060
You don't say.

1280
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:07,274
l'm working for the managers, huh?
Taking your money.

1281
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:12,738
Me? Me that you're into for $500
in touches.

1282
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:15,991
You think l've been lying to you
all the time?

1283
01:25:16,074 --> 01:25:19,578
All right.
You're going to get the truth now.

1284
01:25:20,245 --> 01:25:22,498
Renault, you're through.

1285
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:25,125
Get out.

1286
01:25:25,209 --> 01:25:28,170
l'll get out and l'll stay out...

1287
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,088
but get this first.

1288
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:36,386
l never worked so hard in my life
to put anybody over as l did you.

1289
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,889
You think l told you
all the things that l tried?

1290
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:42,643
No! Because l couldn't come to you
and tell you what they said.

1291
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:44,770
l felt too sorry for you.

1292
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:48,106
You were sorry for me?

1293
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,608
Vaudeville.

1294
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:53,487
Every time l walked into a booking office,
they leaned back and they roared.

1295
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:56,031
They called me
''Mac, the Grave Snatcher.''

1296
01:25:56,114 --> 01:25:58,700
Last night, l sent another telegram
to the Coast.

1297
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:01,703
l knew it was no use, but l sent it anyway.

1298
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,581
You want to see the answer?

1299
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:07,292
No.

1300
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:11,755
''Thank you. When we're in the market
for bit players, we will let you know.''

1301
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:15,717
You're trying to throw a scare into me.

1302
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:16,844
Oh, no.

1303
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:20,305
l'm just telling you the truth.

1304
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:23,058
You know, you never were an actor.

1305
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:26,728
You did have looks, but they're gone now.

1306
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:29,356
You don't have to take my word for it.

1307
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,192
Just look in any mirror. They don't lie.

1308
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:35,362
Take a good look.

1309
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:40,742
Look at those pouches under your eyes.
Look at those creases.

1310
01:26:41,493 --> 01:26:44,037
You sag like an old woman.

1311
01:26:45,164 --> 01:26:47,082
Get a load of yourself.

1312
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:53,380
Wait till you start tramping around
the offices, looking for a job...

1313
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:55,340
because no agent's going to handle you.

1314
01:26:55,424 --> 01:27:00,345
Sitting in those anterooms hour after
hour, giving your name to office boys...

1315
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:02,639
that never even heard of you.

1316
01:27:03,474 --> 01:27:05,392
You're through, Renault.

1317
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:09,438
You're through in pictures and plays
and vaudeville...

1318
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:12,024
and radio and everything.

1319
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:15,277
You're a corpse, and you don't know it.

1320
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:18,155
Go get yourself buried.

1321
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:17,840
They don't want that junk.
They wouldn't give me nothing on it.

1322
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:21,051
Why, it's a silver frame.
The buckle's solid gold.

1323
01:28:21,135 --> 01:28:24,221
You take them. l lugged them
to every pawnshop on Sixth Avenue.

1324
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:26,348
You little liar.
You never took them anyplace.

1325
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:29,393
Say, who you calling a liar,
you down-and-out ham?

1326
01:28:29,476 --> 01:28:32,479
You filthy little rat,
how dare you talk to me like that?

1327
01:28:32,563 --> 01:28:34,398
- Okay.
- Wait a minute.

1328
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:36,733
l didn't mean that. l'm sorry.

1329
01:28:36,984 --> 01:28:41,071
Listen. l got to have some liquor. l'm sick.

1330
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:44,199
Lay it out for me like a good kid.
l'll pay you back.

1331
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:46,201
What kind of a sucker do you think l am?

1332
01:28:46,285 --> 01:28:49,371
l got to have it. l got to.
l'll pay you back tomorrow.

1333
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:50,664
Baloney.

1334
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:09,725
How do you do, Mr. Renault?

1335
01:29:09,808 --> 01:29:13,145
l've not met you before,
though you've been with us for some time.

1336
01:29:13,228 --> 01:29:15,022
l'm Mr. Fitch, the manager.

1337
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:20,277
Mr. Renault, we find ourselves
in a very awkward predicament.

1338
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:23,614
We've just had a communication
from some very old clients of ours...

1339
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:25,115
Mr. and Mrs. Sherman Montgomery.

1340
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,868
They've always occupied
this particular suite.

1341
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:32,122
You know how people are.
They say it's just like home to them.

1342
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:35,459
They're coming in tomorrow.
ls that right, Mr. Hatfield?

1343
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:38,629
- Yes. Tomorrow afternoon.
- There you are.

1344
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:44,134
Under the circumstances, l'm afraid that
we shall have to ask you for these rooms.

1345
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,890
What other rooms can you give me?

1346
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:53,143
That's just the trouble,
you see, we're so terribly full up.

1347
01:29:53,227 --> 01:29:55,103
The horse show and....

1348
01:29:55,187 --> 01:29:58,774
Mr. Hatfield, is there any place
that we can put Mr. Renault?

1349
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:02,027
- l'm afraid not, Mr. Fitch.
- lt's quite all right.

1350
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,489
As a matter of fact...

1351
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:09,076
l was just about to notify your office
l was leaving.

1352
01:30:09,785 --> 01:30:13,121
Some friends of mine, private car...

1353
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:15,165
Palm Beach.

1354
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,877
- When would you want me to
- There's no hurry.

1355
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:21,338
Shall we say noon tomorrow, Mr. Renault?

1356
01:30:22,131 --> 01:30:24,466
-Sure. Good night.
-Thank you very much.

1357
01:30:24,675 --> 01:30:27,427
So sorry to have
inconvenienced you in this way.

1358
01:34:08,106 --> 01:34:09,149
Ed.

1359
01:34:11,944 --> 01:34:13,946
Ed, where are you?

1360
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:18,116
l'm coming.

1361
01:34:22,955 --> 01:34:25,916
- She's got music.
- l hear it.

1362
01:34:30,379 --> 01:34:34,633
- Now, Ed, it isn't going to be so terrible.
- Not so terrible?

1363
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:38,470
Get into this uniform to meet a bunch
of fatheads l don't want to know...

1364
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:42,182
and miss that Greta Garbo picture
l've been waiting for, for two months.

1365
01:34:42,266 --> 01:34:43,892
What's your idea of terrible?

1366
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:48,105
Don't you want to meet Larry Renault?
That's better than going to a movie.

1367
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:50,732
- That has-been.
- And Carlotta Vance.

1368
01:34:50,941 --> 01:34:53,235
And Jenny Lind. ls she coming?

1369
01:34:53,318 --> 01:34:56,029
Now, Ed, Millie's done
a lot of things for us.

1370
01:34:56,113 --> 01:34:57,573
Helps me with my clothes.

1371
01:34:57,656 --> 01:35:00,159
Besides, who can you get at 6:45
but relatives?

1372
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:04,163
All right. l'm a relative and l'm here.
Come on. Let's get it over with.

1373
01:35:05,164 --> 01:35:07,916
- Be careful of the steps.
- l know.

1374
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:20,095
That's very nice, but do you mind?
Not quite so loud.

1375
01:35:20,179 --> 01:35:22,848
There will be people in there
talking, you know.

1376
01:35:22,931 --> 01:35:24,266
Thank you.

1377
01:35:27,936 --> 01:35:30,731
Hello, Ed, hello, Hattie.

1378
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:32,107
Where's Oliver?

1379
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:35,027
Upstairs. He's got a headache
or something.

1380
01:35:35,194 --> 01:35:36,236
Me, too.

1381
01:35:40,866 --> 01:35:44,411
- How nice. So lovely to see you.
- How are you, Mrs. Jordan?

1382
01:35:44,495 --> 01:35:48,290
- You know Mrs. Packard, l believe.
- Of course. How lovely of you to come.

1383
01:35:48,373 --> 01:35:53,212
- So nice of you to ask us, l'm sure.
- Mrs. Packard, may l present my cousins...

1384
01:35:53,295 --> 01:35:55,088
Mr. and Mrs. Loomis. Mr. Packard.

1385
01:35:55,172 --> 01:35:58,842
- l'm pleased to meet you, l'm sure.
- How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Loomis?

1386
01:35:58,926 --> 01:36:01,553
You know, for a minute there
l had you wrong.

1387
01:36:01,637 --> 01:36:05,140
l figured that maybe you were Ferncliffe.

1388
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:08,310
You're close. l'm pinch-hitting for him.

1389
01:36:09,186 --> 01:36:10,854
What's the matter?

1390
01:36:14,233 --> 01:36:16,235
l'm so sorry to disappoint you...

1391
01:36:16,318 --> 01:36:20,405
but Lord Ferncliffe was taken frightfully ill
with neuritis this afternoon.

1392
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:22,115
l am so sorry.

1393
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:25,285
Do you mean to say
that Ferncliffe won't be here?

1394
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:28,705
Yes. lsn't it terrible?
They had to rush him off to Florida.

1395
01:36:39,174 --> 01:36:43,178
l don't care for Florida. Do you?
Have you ever been to Florida?

1396
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:49,434
l love it. We're not going down this winter.

1397
01:36:49,518 --> 01:36:51,687
- Are you?
- l don't know.

1398
01:36:52,312 --> 01:36:55,941
Are we going to Florida
this winter, sweetheart?

1399
01:36:56,108 --> 01:36:58,652
l wouldn't count on it if l were you.

1400
01:36:58,986 --> 01:37:00,445
l'll miss it so.

1401
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:04,491
lt's so wonderful to have nothing to do,
just to lie all day in the sun.

1402
01:37:04,575 --> 01:37:07,911
Yes, but you've got to be awful careful
that you don't get blistered.

1403
01:37:08,036 --> 01:37:12,249
You know, my skin's terribly delicate,
and l don't dare expose it.

1404
01:37:15,419 --> 01:37:16,753
Pardon me.

1405
01:37:19,798 --> 01:37:22,301
- Hello, Lucy.
- Hello, Millicent.

1406
01:37:22,384 --> 01:37:25,471
- My, you look charming.
- Lucy, you know everyone, don't you?

1407
01:37:25,554 --> 01:37:28,432
- Hello.
- Glad to see you.

1408
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:31,268
Haven't seen you around the house lately.
What's the matter?

1409
01:37:31,351 --> 01:37:32,895
Did the patient get well on you?

1410
01:37:32,978 --> 01:37:36,607
She's getting along very well without me,
aren't you, Mrs. Packard?

1411
01:37:37,149 --> 01:37:40,235
l get along better
when you're looking after me.

1412
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:46,325
Millicent, darling.

1413
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:51,371
Do forgive me. l had to bring him.
He wouldn't stay at home.

1414
01:37:51,455 --> 01:37:55,334
He cried and he cried. Didn't you, Tarzan?

1415
01:37:59,254 --> 01:38:01,298
lsn't he sweet?

1416
01:38:02,966 --> 01:38:07,054
Carlotta, you know Mrs. Talbot, don't you?
And my cousin, Mrs. Loomis.

1417
01:38:07,179 --> 01:38:09,556
What do you think of Bunny Ferncliffe?

1418
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,310
Dashing off to Florida
and ruining your whole dinner party.

1419
01:38:13,393 --> 01:38:16,772
You know, l went to the hotel
and found his telegram.

1420
01:38:16,855 --> 01:38:20,651
''Off on a fishing trip. Love your America.

1421
01:38:20,776 --> 01:38:22,861
''Never felt better in my life."

1422
01:38:22,945 --> 01:38:27,616
''Caroline and l want you to join us.
Wire Palm Beach. Bunny.''

1423
01:38:27,699 --> 01:38:29,743
lsn't Bunny a swine?

1424
01:38:33,038 --> 01:38:35,541
l'd rather go away in the winter
than in the summer.

1425
01:38:35,624 --> 01:38:37,876
l love New York in the summer.

1426
01:38:39,128 --> 01:38:41,964
Where's Paula?
l'm just dying to see her again.

1427
01:38:42,131 --> 01:38:45,175
Ernest came back tonight.
They're in the library talking.

1428
01:38:45,259 --> 01:38:48,262
They're going to be married, you know?
Ernest DeGraff.

1429
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:49,721
DeGraff?

1430
01:38:51,473 --> 01:38:55,519
l think l knew his father. l did.

1431
01:38:56,436 --> 01:38:58,814
l think l'll barge along...

1432
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:01,900
and talk to Paula alone in the library.

1433
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:08,282
My dear. You poor little man.

1434
01:39:08,365 --> 01:39:11,034
You look so lonely. Here.

1435
01:39:11,368 --> 01:39:13,370
Tarzan will keep you company.

1436
01:39:15,706 --> 01:39:18,333
And then l had a little time,
so l went to Budapest.

1437
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:21,795
Say, there's a place we've got to go
on our honeymoon.

1438
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:27,176
Ernest, while you've been away,
there's something....

1439
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:31,638
There you are, you two turtledoves!

1440
01:39:31,722 --> 01:39:33,765
-Paula.
-Carlotta.

1441
01:39:33,849 --> 01:39:37,269
And this is Ernest! l'm Carlotta Vance.

1442
01:39:37,478 --> 01:39:41,148
And don't tell me that your grandfather
saw me when he was a boy.

1443
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:42,983
How did you know that l was Ernest?

1444
01:39:43,066 --> 01:39:46,028
l can tell an Ernest 20 feet off.

1445
01:39:46,111 --> 01:39:49,656
Do you suppose you two could stop
billing and cooing just long enough...

1446
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:51,575
for me to have a little word with Paula?

1447
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:55,787
All right. The next billing and cooing
will take place at 8:45.

1448
01:39:56,538 --> 01:40:01,210
Dear. He's charming, isn't he?
So like his father.

1449
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:03,587
l hope he'll be as generous.

1450
01:40:04,004 --> 01:40:06,298
Why haven't you been to see me, Paula?

1451
01:40:06,381 --> 01:40:10,177
- l'm at the Versailles.
- The Versailles.

1452
01:40:11,053 --> 01:40:13,013
Yes, of course. l must come.

1453
01:40:13,931 --> 01:40:17,184
That's on East 48th Street, isn't it?

1454
01:40:18,477 --> 01:40:22,439
Not quite. East 53rd Street, l believe.

1455
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:25,984
Yes, l was thinking of something else.

1456
01:40:26,068 --> 01:40:28,237
Yes, l suppose you were.

1457
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,905
You know, l'm on the eighth floor.

1458
01:40:29,988 --> 01:40:32,991
Curiously enough,
just down the hall from....

1459
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:39,998
You've seen me, then.

1460
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:45,003
What of it? l'm not ashamed.

1461
01:40:45,087 --> 01:40:48,215
- No, dear.
- Go ahead. Tell Mother.

1462
01:40:48,298 --> 01:40:50,551
l'm going to tell her myself.

1463
01:40:52,219 --> 01:40:56,473
lt's funny. l should think
at least you would understand.

1464
01:40:57,391 --> 01:41:00,686
l haven't said l don't understand.

1465
01:41:03,772 --> 01:41:06,608
Do you? Then for heaven's sake, help me.

1466
01:41:06,859 --> 01:41:10,028
Talk to Father for me, will you?
You can help me.

1467
01:41:10,821 --> 01:41:13,448
l'm sorry. l can't.

1468
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:15,951
Not now.

1469
01:41:16,034 --> 01:41:19,037
All right. You want me to give him up.

1470
01:41:19,121 --> 01:41:20,581
l won't.

1471
01:41:20,664 --> 01:41:22,833
You're just like all the rest
of the old people.

1472
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:25,419
l'm sure l am, but

1473
01:41:25,502 --> 01:41:27,754
You think you know what's best
because you're old.

1474
01:41:27,838 --> 01:41:30,048
You think you can tell me
what to do with my life.

1475
01:41:30,132 --> 01:41:31,758
You can't, because it's my life.

1476
01:41:31,842 --> 01:41:34,303
l'm young. l've got a right
to go to the man l love.

1477
01:41:34,386 --> 01:41:37,931
l'm sure you have, dear, but....

1478
01:41:39,808 --> 01:41:44,396
But what? What could you possibly say
that could keep me from going to him?

1479
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:48,692
Simply that he's killed himself.

1480
01:41:55,073 --> 01:41:56,575
That's not so.

1481
01:41:58,494 --> 01:42:00,078
lt can't be.

1482
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:03,499
They found him
just as l was starting to come here.

1483
01:42:03,582 --> 01:42:06,627
Poor Paula. l'm so sorry.

1484
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:08,837
- Where are you going?
- To him.

1485
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:11,548
No. Listen, Paula.

1486
01:42:11,632 --> 01:42:13,967
l realize that l'm an old woman...

1487
01:42:14,051 --> 01:42:17,429
and young people have a right to do
what they want...

1488
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:21,058
but at this time
l think you should consider someone else.

1489
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:22,935
Your father.

1490
01:42:25,312 --> 01:42:29,983
My poor Larry. He's dead, Carlotta.

1491
01:42:31,568 --> 01:42:33,570
And nothing can be done.

1492
01:42:34,947 --> 01:42:37,699
That's the unfortunate thing about death.

1493
01:42:39,243 --> 01:42:42,496
lt's so terribly final.

1494
01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:47,209
Even the young can't do anything about it.

1495
01:42:53,549 --> 01:42:56,885
Really. Listen, darling.

1496
01:42:56,969 --> 01:42:59,805
Don't.

1497
01:42:59,888 --> 01:43:01,557
Paula, listen.

1498
01:43:03,684 --> 01:43:05,435
l wonder what's keeping Oliver.

1499
01:43:05,519 --> 01:43:07,437
What would you say he's missed...

1500
01:43:07,521 --> 01:43:10,524
by not being in this room
the last 10 minutes?

1501
01:43:10,983 --> 01:43:12,109
l don't know.

1502
01:43:12,192 --> 01:43:15,362
l guess German pictures are all right
if you like German pictures.

1503
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:18,991
Say, Mrs. Talbot, l've just been talking
with your husband...

1504
01:43:19,074 --> 01:43:21,243
and l find that we have a lot in common.

1505
01:43:21,326 --> 01:43:22,911
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1506
01:43:22,995 --> 01:43:26,373
We're members of the same golf club.

1507
01:43:26,456 --> 01:43:27,833
How nice.

1508
01:43:28,292 --> 01:43:30,461
l wonder when we eat.

1509
01:43:31,295 --> 01:43:32,921
- Pardon, madam.
- Yes, Dora?

1510
01:43:33,005 --> 01:43:35,841
Will you please come upstairs?
Mr. Jordan isn't feeling well.

1511
01:43:35,924 --> 01:43:39,261
Very well, Dora. l don't know how l...
l've got to

1512
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:41,138
Maybe l'd better go up
and see him with you.

1513
01:43:41,221 --> 01:43:42,723
- Perhaps you'd better.
- Yes, surely.

1514
01:43:45,559 --> 01:43:47,644
Oliver.

1515
01:43:48,896 --> 01:43:52,024
l'm all right, Millicent. Don't worry, please.

1516
01:43:52,107 --> 01:43:55,068
lt's something l had for lunch.

1517
01:43:55,152 --> 01:43:57,154
- Talbot?
- Certainly.

1518
01:43:57,237 --> 01:43:59,114
Have you any spirits of ammonia?

1519
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:02,075
l think there's some in the medicine chest.
l'll get it.

1520
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,911
l'll be right back, Oliver.

1521
01:44:07,664 --> 01:44:11,835
- l'm all right.
- There, there, now. Take it easy, old man.

1522
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:14,213
That's right.

1523
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:32,314
Here you are, dear. You do this.
You can do it much better than l can...

1524
01:44:32,397 --> 01:44:35,776
and remember,
we must not spoil Millicent's dinner.

1525
01:44:36,068 --> 01:44:39,029
They probably won't know
anything about this news until tomorrow.

1526
01:44:39,112 --> 01:44:40,364
l'm all right now. Thank you.

1527
01:44:40,447 --> 01:44:42,533
Of course you are, my dear.

1528
01:44:43,617 --> 01:44:47,120
Now Ernest won't notice a thing.

1529
01:44:49,498 --> 01:44:52,459
l don't want to see Ernest.
l don't want to see anybody.

1530
01:44:52,543 --> 01:44:56,713
Yes, you do, dear.
But l want to tell you one thing.

1531
01:44:57,214 --> 01:45:00,259
Don't ever let him know anything
about this...

1532
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:03,011
'cause if there's one thing l know, it's men.

1533
01:45:03,095 --> 01:45:05,264
l ought to. lt's been my life work.

1534
01:45:07,182 --> 01:45:09,768
l can't ever love another man.

1535
01:45:09,852 --> 01:45:11,937
No, of course you can't, dear.

1536
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:16,525
But if you should,
you know, someone like Ernest...

1537
01:45:16,608 --> 01:45:19,403
he won't want to know anything
about your past...

1538
01:45:19,486 --> 01:45:22,030
as long as you keep it in the past.

1539
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:23,991
Come on, dear.

1540
01:45:58,775 --> 01:46:01,445
Why, Millicent, what is it?

1541
01:46:01,528 --> 01:46:03,530
l had to tell her, Oliver.

1542
01:46:05,574 --> 01:46:07,034
Oliver, my poor

1543
01:46:07,117 --> 01:46:09,620
No, don't, dear. Please.

1544
01:46:09,703 --> 01:46:12,539
Sit down, Oliver.

1545
01:46:12,623 --> 01:46:15,459
That's it. Here. Drink this.

1546
01:46:19,588 --> 01:46:22,549
Why didn't you tell me?

1547
01:46:22,633 --> 01:46:26,386
Dear, it isn't as bad as all that. ls it, now?

1548
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:28,555
No. Not at all.

1549
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,688
Dear heart, l would have told you
all about it.

1550
01:46:36,772 --> 01:46:40,317
No, you wouldn't.
And l've been too busy to notice...

1551
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,319
while you've been suffering.

1552
01:46:43,612 --> 01:46:47,866
Oliver, l do love you,
and l've always loved you...

1553
01:46:48,617 --> 01:46:51,745
even though l have turned into a silly...

1554
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:54,164
stupid, useless wife.

1555
01:46:54,289 --> 01:46:57,126
Now, but you haven't, Millie.

1556
01:46:57,209 --> 01:47:01,338
As a matter of fact,
you've turned out a much better wife...

1557
01:47:01,421 --> 01:47:02,923
than l have a husband.

1558
01:47:03,006 --> 01:47:05,968
- No.
- Yes.

1559
01:47:06,135 --> 01:47:09,555
You see, the thing
that's troubling me most, Millie...

1560
01:47:09,638 --> 01:47:12,057
is that...

1561
01:47:12,808 --> 01:47:16,186
l'm afraid the Jordan Line is gone.

1562
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:19,439
- Gone?
- We're broke.

1563
01:47:22,568 --> 01:47:26,071
But everybody's broke, darling.
Don't let that worry you.

1564
01:47:26,572 --> 01:47:29,241
We'll economize. That's what we'll do.

1565
01:47:29,324 --> 01:47:31,827
We'll economize. Now, let me see.

1566
01:47:35,038 --> 01:47:38,375
l don't have to take a box for that
charity thing Saturday night now...

1567
01:47:38,459 --> 01:47:40,752
you know, for backward orphans
or something.

1568
01:47:40,836 --> 01:47:42,796
And l'll cancel my hairdresser's tomorrow.

1569
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,715
You leave everything to me.

1570
01:47:45,549 --> 01:47:49,720
And with Paula married to Ernest,
we'll take a smaller place somewhere.

1571
01:47:50,512 --> 01:47:53,140
Hello, Embassy Club.
This is Mrs. Oliver Jordan.

1572
01:47:53,223 --> 01:47:57,394
l want to cancel my table
for after the theater tonight. Thank you.

1573
01:47:57,811 --> 01:48:00,814
And you go to bed
right after dinner, darling.

1574
01:48:02,191 --> 01:48:07,070
Darling, we're going to be
happier than ever. You'll see.

1575
01:48:07,863 --> 01:48:10,073
l like it in New York in the summer.

1576
01:48:10,157 --> 01:48:14,036
l've had some swell times
on penthouse parties.

1577
01:48:14,119 --> 01:48:17,164
All my life, l've wanted
to be a penthouse girl.

1578
01:48:17,247 --> 01:48:19,750
Yeah. You'd be good at that.

1579
01:48:21,251 --> 01:48:23,337
l'll be seeing you.

1580
01:48:33,055 --> 01:48:34,223
- Joseph.
- Yes, madam.

1581
01:48:34,306 --> 01:48:36,683
You can announce dinner
in a few moments.

1582
01:48:36,767 --> 01:48:37,893
Yes, madam.

1583
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,524
- Hello, Hattie.
- Hello, Oliver.

1584
01:48:43,607 --> 01:48:45,442
- How are you, Ed?
- l'm fine.

1585
01:48:45,526 --> 01:48:47,361
- You all right?
- Fine, thanks.

1586
01:48:47,444 --> 01:48:49,571
Oliver, l've missed you.

1587
01:48:49,655 --> 01:48:52,491
l'm sorry. l had to telephone.
Some business.

1588
01:48:52,658 --> 01:48:55,577
You're not cross with Carlotta, are you?

1589
01:48:56,161 --> 01:48:58,288
You know l love you.

1590
01:48:59,498 --> 01:49:02,084
- Go on. Tell Jordan.
- Shut up.

1591
01:49:02,167 --> 01:49:04,211
- Go on and tell him.
- Shut up.

1592
01:49:04,294 --> 01:49:06,505
lf you don't, you'll be sorry
as long as you live.

1593
01:49:06,588 --> 01:49:08,549
Shut up.

1594
01:49:09,299 --> 01:49:12,719
- How do you do, Mrs. Packard?
- Glad to see you, l'm sure.

1595
01:49:12,803 --> 01:49:15,764
- Oliver, how are you?
- Glad to see you.

1596
01:49:15,848 --> 01:49:17,266
l'm delighted, l assure you.

1597
01:49:17,349 --> 01:49:18,809
We'll go in to dinner.

1598
01:49:18,892 --> 01:49:21,145
Seems rather rude
not to wait for Mr. Renault.

1599
01:49:21,228 --> 01:49:22,896
But after all, it's nearly 9:00.

1600
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:24,898
You're not going to tell him?

1601
01:49:34,616 --> 01:49:38,704
- Mr. Jordan, l've got
- l'll tell him.

1602
01:49:38,871 --> 01:49:42,291
Dan never will let me talk
to anyone that's attractive.

1603
01:49:43,459 --> 01:49:46,712
Oliver, l've got something
very important to tell you.

1604
01:49:47,045 --> 01:49:48,380
l've got some news for you.

1605
01:49:48,464 --> 01:49:50,924
News? When a man bites a dog,
that's news.

1606
01:49:53,385 --> 01:49:56,180
l hope you'll like that stuff l brought
from Paris for you.

1607
01:49:56,263 --> 01:49:57,556
One of them is a knockout.

1608
01:49:57,639 --> 01:50:01,310
You came near losing the Jordan Lines
this afternoon.

1609
01:50:01,393 --> 01:50:05,230
A dirty crook by the name of Baldridge
tried to pull a fast one.

1610
01:50:05,314 --> 01:50:08,358
- You don't mean
- Yes, but l saved it for you.

1611
01:50:08,442 --> 01:50:09,818
We headed him off.

1612
01:50:09,902 --> 01:50:12,488
Say, old man, l've been
awfully unfair to you.

1613
01:50:12,571 --> 01:50:13,614
Oh, no.

1614
01:50:14,364 --> 01:50:17,075
l was reading a book the other day.

1615
01:50:18,243 --> 01:50:19,328
Reading a book?

1616
01:50:19,411 --> 01:50:21,705
Yes. lt's all about
civilization or something.

1617
01:50:21,789 --> 01:50:25,000
A nutty kind of a book.
You know, the guy says that machinery...

1618
01:50:25,083 --> 01:50:27,377
is going to take the place
of every profession.

1619
01:50:27,461 --> 01:50:31,965
My dear, that's something
you need never worry about.

1620
01:50:33,717 --> 01:50:36,178
Say, l want to sit next to Oliver!

1621
01:50:36,345 --> 01:50:38,847
Oliver, where are you?

1622
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:54,655
English

1623
