1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,888
Thirty beautiful girls,
the pick of New York City.

3
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,186
Guaranteed to send a shiver
up and down the spine...

4
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:17,522
of each and every boy from 18 to 80.

5
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,118
<i>The gallant extravaganza...</i>

6
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:22,653
- I don't like the looks of this place, Tod.
- Come on, you'll get a lot of laughs.

7
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:24,962
Step right up, folks. Step right up.
Step right up.

8
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:27,400
Thirty beautiful girls,
the pick of New York.

9
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,836
- Where do they pick them from?
- Right off the streets.

10
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:31,032
Come, come.

11
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,903
You're talking of the ladies I love.

12
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:37,772
Hey, mister,
can you spare a quarter today?

13
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:41,815
- Come on, I'll buy you a ticket. One more.
- Thanks.

14
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,986
I ain't had no entertainment for weeks.

15
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:46,487
There you are, Mr. Farnsworth,
there you are.

16
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:50,322
- Has the striptease begun yet?
- No, not yet.

17
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:54,022
<i>- Tod, what is a striptease?
- Oh, it's some more of that...</i>

18
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:55,121
What?

19
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,190
<i>Hey, young fella
Best to close your old umbrella</i>

20
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:00,395
<i>Have a glorious day
Throwing rubbers away</i>

21
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,665
<i>'Cause it ain't gonna rain no more</i>

22
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:06,698
<i>Hey, young fella
Put your raincoat in the cellar</i>

23
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,040
<i>While you're tying your tie
Take a peek at that sky</i>

24
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:11,307
<i>'Cause it ain't gonna rain no more</i>

25
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,372
<i>Look at that brave little rainbow</i>

26
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,474
<i>Fighting those clouds up above</i>

27
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,543
<i>I'm in the ring, Mr. Rainbow</i>

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,554
<i>With a horseshoe in my glove</i>

29
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:23,891
<i>Hey, young fella
Throw away your old umbrella</i>

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,155
<i>Give your trousers a hitch
'Cause we're gonna be rich</i>

31
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,527
<i>'Cause it ain't gonna rain no more</i>

32
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:35,095
Hey, pipe the carriage trade.

33
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,576
<i>Give him love</i>

34
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:54,383
<i>With a kiss</i>

35
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,555
<i>Hold him close to you</i>

36
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:05,829
<i>With love's caress</i>

37
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:11,496
<i>Lead him on to happiness</i>

38
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,374
<i>With a sigh</i>

39
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:19,546
<i>And the thrill</i>

40
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,749
<i>Close your drowsy eyes</i>

41
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:30,452
<i>Drift to paradise</i>

42
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,153
<i>Give him love</i>

43
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:36,688
<i>And you'll hold your man</i>

44
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,198
Say, Janie...

45
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:45,401
get a load of Park Avenue, will you?

46
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,837
Yeah, doing the slums in ermine.

47
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,263
I'll pull it for you, baby.

48
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,403
Encore, encore!

49
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,420
Wait a minute, beautiful.

50
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,323
Come on over to the station house,
the Lieutenant is throwing a party.

51
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,419
- Can't I even get some clothes?
- No, he wants you just as you are.

52
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:15,361
Oh, it's that kind of a party.

53
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:19,026
<i>- Yes, it's that kind of a party. Come on.
- Well, wait a minute. Don't get to...</i>

54
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,438
All of you, sit down.

55
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:25,297
Hey, what's the big idea?

56
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,639
All right then! He should come.

57
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:37,116
Oh, goody, we're going on a buggy ride.
I won't even have to walk home.

58
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:43,882
All right, let's go.

59
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,327
Get in, Mr. Farnsworth. Get in.

60
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,796
Thank you so much for the lovely party.

61
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,662
- Where do we go from here?
- Night court.

62
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:54,294
Night court? Excuse me, I'll walk.

63
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,842
Order in the court!

64
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,184
You are charged
with giving an indecent performance...

65
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,520
at the International Burlesque house.

66
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:20,153
- Who's the arresting officer?
- I am, sir.

67
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,457
What did you see?

68
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,228
- Well, they were doing an indecent dance.
- What kind of a dance?

69
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,065
Well, it was something like this,
Your Honor.

70
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,072
These girls were doing a striptease.

71
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,411
A striptease. I see.

72
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,915
What is your name?

73
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,442
Rosette Henrietta LaRue.
Occupation: Hip swinging.

74
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:54,158
Now, Miss LaRue,
just what constitutes a striptease?

75
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,755
A good constitution
and a couple of zippers.

76
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,300
- Don't be ambiguous.
- I won't if you won't!

77
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,034
Sergeant...

78
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,240
to what extent of exposure
does the striptease go?

79
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:14,181
Hey, don't ask him, ask me.
I'll be delighted to show you.

80
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,514
<i>- No, you won't!
- What's the matter? Why can't I show...</i>

81
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:17,610
Order!

82
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,253
Next defendant.

83
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:30,227
The judge could give you 15 years
for what you're thinking.

84
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:31,789
It'd be worth it.

85
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,428
- Name?
- Janie Barlow.

86
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:37,132
- Occupation?
- Social worker.

87
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,667
Why were you doing a striptease?

88
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,875
If you'd walked the streets
looking for a job...

89
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,140
and hadn't eaten for a week,
you'd do a striptease, too.

90
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,774
Do you mean to tell me
that in a city like this...

91
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,614
burlesque dancing
was the only work you could find?

92
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,551
It was the only dancing I could find.

93
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:55,284
- Did it have to be dancing?
- Yeah, it had to be dancing.

94
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,485
- Why?
- Because I'm a dancer.

95
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,154
Young woman,
am I the defendant or are you?

96
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,220
I don't know who's the defendant,
but I'm the victim...

97
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,492
and you don't have to rub it in.

98
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,056
I don't see any girls hauled in here...

99
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,500
for pushing pencils around on paper
or massaging a typewriter.

100
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,334
I'm a dancer and I'll keep right on
being one when I get out of here.

101
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,431
You'll get out of here
when you pay a $30 fine.

102
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,100
You can't fine me, I haven't got a dime.

103
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:16,839
All right. $30 fine or 30 days in jail.

104
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,540
Right this way, please.

105
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,505
Recess, 15 minutes.

106
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,381
Let's go some place and get a drink.
I'm bored.

107
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,221
- Yes. Let's do that.
- Okay.

108
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,788
Take them over to the St. Regis Roof.
I'll join you later.

109
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:37,958
All right.

110
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,100
Come on. Come on, on your feet.

111
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,638
What's the matter now? Raising the ante?

112
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:54,080
No, dearie, somebody's paid your losses.

113
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,980
<i>- What? You mean...
- You're bailed out.</i>

114
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,901
<i>Why'd you pay that $30 fine, Mr...</i>

115
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:16,266
- Newton.
- Mr. Newton.

116
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,475
That's my business. Investments.

117
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:25,405
Sorry to tell you, but I'm
the kind of investment that don't pay.

118
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,440
- Why, I could give you everything...
- Can it.

119
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,256
Say, what're you writing all the time?

120
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,251
I'll tell you later.

121
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,536
You sure drink a good dinner.

122
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:51,897
Now, why did you want
to change the subject?

123
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,144
- What subject?
- You.

124
00:09:57,546 --> 00:10:01,312
Don't you know you'll never get anywhere
with those notions of yours?

125
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,079
Maybe I will.

126
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:08,616
I'm like that guy
throwing quarters in the slot machine.

127
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,922
- I keep on trying.
- Listen, those machines are fixed.

128
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:15,293
It's 1,000 to 1 shot
unless you know the combination.

129
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:18,734
And I'm the little fellow
that knows the combination.

130
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,963
Little fellows like you have been trying
to teach me all sorts of combinations...

131
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,669
ever since I was a kid.

132
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,475
- But I only know one game.
- Dancing?

133
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,202
You said it.

134
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:36,012
Just the same, you're not playing
that right, with stopovers in jail.

135
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,719
I'll get my break.

136
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:40,583
I'm your break, beautiful.

137
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:45,355
I'm a chance of a lifetime, Janie.
You better take me up.

138
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,494
Oh boy, I won!

139
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,395
I'll stick to them 1,000 to 1 shots.
Sometimes they win.

140
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:00,737
I must say you're a pal.

141
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,778
Leaving me to get home from jail
on my own.

142
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:06,178
On your own? With that swell
Park Avenue juvenile bailing you out.

143
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,374
Why, you poor halfwit.

144
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,918
I sneaked off on purpose
just to give you a break.

145
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,954
You didn't stop to think I might have
to wrestle my way home, did you?

146
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:15,456
Oh, that's all right. Let him insult you.

147
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,091
Many a girl has cashed in
on a good, hearty insult.

148
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,130
Oh, I nearly forgot. He gave me a note.

149
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,827
Hope he signed his right name.

150
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,364
A $50.

151
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:39,343
"Don't say 'them things.'

152
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:42,849
"Don't say 'can it.' Don't say 'guy.'

153
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,884
"Don't buy shoes with ribbons on them.

154
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:52,293
"Don't forget, what's a striptease
on Second Avenue is art on Broadway.

155
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:56,187
"The $50 is to buy yourself a dress
without a zipper."

156
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,430
"Don't say 'can it."'

157
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,437
"Don't say 'guy."'

158
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,871
"Don't say 'them things."'

159
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,508
Why, that Park Avenue know-it-all.

160
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,911
"Don't buy shoes with ribbons on them."

161
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,246
Fresh egg! And don't...

162
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:19,947
And don't get so noble with the groceries.
There's enough in this to eat for a month.

163
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,617
Oh, all right.

164
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:23,791
Now I owe him $80.

165
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,089
Oh, how can you pal around with me
and still stay so dumb?

166
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:38,104
Say, what's the matter with them shoes?

167
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:41,903
These shoes.

168
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:44,508
Come on, baby, hit the hay.

169
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,205
The joint will be jammed tomorrow
and after our pinch tonight...

170
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,184
they'll expect us girls
to pull that zipper twice as fast.

171
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,277
I'm not going back to the joint.

172
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,487
I'm through with burlesque. I'm going up.

173
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,185
Up town and on my own.

174
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:03,197
Listen, hon, I've been up there
and I came down flat on my own.

175
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,698
Oh, can it.

176
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:06,992
Drop it.

177
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,696
<i>Variety says Patch Gallagher
is putting on a new show.</i>

178
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:13,301
What kind of a guy
is this Patch Gallagher, Rosie?

179
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,673
Compared to him
an elephant's hide is tissue paper.

180
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,541
But he sure knows his stuff.

181
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,110
I'm going to see him in the morning.

182
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,175
Yeah?

183
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,246
And I'm having breakfast
at the White House.

184
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,857
I'm going to work for Patch Gallagher.

185
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:35,453
You can dream better if you'll get to sleep.

186
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:37,822
I'm through dreaming.

187
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,992
I'm gonna start doing.

188
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm going up where it's art.

189
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:44,769
Uptown.

190
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:09,254
I was never treated so disgracefully
in my life.

191
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:10,525
Don't lose your temper now.

192
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,191
And you all can tell that Mr. Gallagher...

193
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,396
that cotton will grow black
before I come to see him again, sir.

194
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,599
Where we all come from
gentlemen know how to speak to ladies.

195
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,505
- And you can tell him from me...
- Break it up.

196
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:23,374
You all go back
to the Mason-Dixon line, sugar.

197
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,047
What a wise agent you are.

198
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,022
Gallagher ain't tough enough.
You had to make him tougher.

199
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,558
Oh, I told you that Southern accent
would sound phony.

200
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,527
Now, wait a minute.
Listen, wait a minute, won't you?

201
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,608
Way up. Way up. Come on. That's it.

202
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,179
Now, back. Back, back.

203
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,013
All right, all right. Break it up, break it up.

204
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,815
Just a minute, Miss Warner.
All right, Harry.

205
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,828
- I met a Southern girl out there.
- Way from the South?

206
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:17,127
Now, don't tell me.
Don't tell me you're from the South.

207
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,996
And they want to build a statue
of my father...

208
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:20,092
but I wouldn't let them.

209
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,660
- Oh, stop. Come in.
- Yeah. That's true.

210
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,968
Don't tell me they want to make
a statue of your father.

211
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,304
- Look.
- Hello.

212
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,309
What do you want?

213
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:33,612
I was wondering if y'all could tell me
where I could find Mr. Gallagher?

214
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,582
What do you want Mr. Gallagher for?

215
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:38,552
Well, I'd kind of like to talk to him
about that Southern part.

216
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,350
About the Southern part.

217
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,717
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

218
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,223
There he is over there.
Take a good look at him.

219
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,691
It's funny, but I'm a little nearsighted.

220
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,757
I'm afraid
I'll have to get a little closer to him.

221
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,736
Come on, come on. You're big-eyed
enough to see that he's busy.

222
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,499
But I wouldn't take up any of his time.

223
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,562
The lady is leaving.

224
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,199
Look now,
I know if you'd let me get in there...

225
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:02,004
that he'd let me do this part.
I know he would.

226
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:05,240
Did you read that sign on the door:
"No more girls wanted"?

227
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:06,645
Yes, I read it.

228
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,650
Will you read it again
and get that mush out of your mouth?

229
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,778
How'd you like some of it in your eye,
you big bruiser?

230
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:16,583
- Steve.
- Okay, boss.

231
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,388
I've decided to take Miss Warner
for the part.

232
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,484
- Miss Warner?
- Yeah.

233
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,619
Oh, I see.

234
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,596
Congratulations, Miss Warner.

235
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:24,326
You all don't come from the South,
do you?

236
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,424
No.

237
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:26,900
- Steve.
- Yeah, boss?

238
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:29,096
That's all today.
Regular rehearsal a week from Monday.

239
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,969
Break it up! Break it up!
That's all for today.

240
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,441
The regular rehearsals start
a week from Monday.

241
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,842
- So, you took Warner, eh?
- Yeah. I know she's not so hot.

242
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,573
But with all the real talent
gone to Hollywood...

243
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,171
you gotta make the best
of what you can get.

244
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,841
We'll be down to using midgets
pretty soon.

245
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,578
Well, work on her.
Use the whip if you have to.

246
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:45,244
She's got to be loosened up
by the time we open.

247
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,844
I'll offer her candy. Maybe she likes candy.

248
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,085
- Offer her anything but more money.
- Okay, Mr. Gallagher.

249
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:55,178
Hello.

250
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,646
Hello.

251
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,048
Hello.

252
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:02,661
- Slumming again?
- No, I joined the Uplifters Society.

253
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:04,528
- Who's the victim?
- You.

254
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,262
I looked for you down at the burlesque,
I couldn't find you.

255
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,702
- You going after art?
- Gallagher.

256
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:14,034
You're finding out the machines are fixed
against your 1,000 to 1 shot?

257
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,375
- Lf you're running low on coins...
- No.

258
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:18,675
Don't pull that $50 gag again, please.

259
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,578
Aren't you ready to give up?

260
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,776
I've been chasing that guy, Gallagher
around for days.

261
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,980
But I'm young yet.
Got a lot of time ahead of me.

262
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,027
Got a lot of sleep to catch up on, too.

263
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,620
- Goodnight, Mr. Newton.
- Hey, wait a minute.

264
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,833
Now, suppose I gave you a letter
to Jasper Bradley...

265
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,698
make it easy for you?

266
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,870
- Bradley?
- That's Gallagher's boss.

267
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,036
How about it?

268
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:50,673
What's there in it for you?

269
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,772
Now, this is no place to discuss that.

270
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:56,511
- Come on, let's go upstairs.
- Can't you read?

271
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,612
I'm no gentleman.

272
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,791
Besides, I need pen and ink for that letter.

273
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,156
You'll find pen and ink in the parlor.

274
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,756
- Okay.
- Hey, wait a minute.

275
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,594
You haven't told me yet where you cut in.

276
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,635
If you want it that way,
I won't cut in at all.

277
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:17,570
- At least not for a while.
- No. I'll do it for art's sake.

278
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,843
Okay. I'll take it.

279
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:27,274
But remember,
I stay out of your private collection.

280
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:35,054
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Bradley.

281
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:37,148
- Good morning, Miss Allen.
- Good morning, Mr. Bradley.

282
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,887
- Good morning, Miss Allen.
- Good morning, Junior.

283
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,451
I mean, Mr. Bradley.

284
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,336
What do you think
I want to see you about?

285
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:50,901
How about un-belting
with some more cash for this show?

286
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,441
You're not putting on
a dog and monkey circus, you know.

287
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:55,135
Look at these costumes.

288
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:59,409
- See anything wrong with them?
- No. They're very pretty. Very nice.

289
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,813
Yes, they're pretty. They're nice.

290
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,852
I suppose you can see
they're not of the same period.

291
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,184
The styles are only a hundred years apart.

292
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:09,451
What of it?
Nobody will know the difference.

293
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:11,719
Besides, they're the best we could rent.

294
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,421
So that's the gag. Rented.

295
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:15,963
You can afford to buy some, can't you?

296
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:18,625
Yes, I can,
but there are taxes and advertising...

297
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,759
and salaries for people like you
and Junior.

298
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:24,067
It costs money to send Junior to Harvard
to study the drama.

299
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,834
Well, you can write that off as a dead loss.

300
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:27,842
Oh, now, now,
don't get excited over nothing.

301
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,140
If you don't care about your rep,
I care about mine.

302
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:33,409
And I'm not going to put on
a charity bazaar for anybody! That's flat!

303
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,610
- Did I ever deny you anything?
- Never mind the salve.

304
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:39,813
- Do I get the costumes?
- All right, of course. Of course.

305
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:42,789
You didn't really mean to walk out on me
just for a few costumes.

306
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,952
Rather than send beautiful girls
out in those, I'd let them go on naked.

307
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,723
You know, Papa, that's a swell idea.

308
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:49,661
It's the same idea
that got you kicked out of school.

309
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,631
Come on, girls. On the stage.

310
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,292
Junior!

311
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,229
Yes, Papa.

312
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,260
Come in.

313
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,074
- Mr. Bradley...
- Go away, I can't see anyone. I'm busy.

314
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,509
- But I have a...
- I told you to go away. Go away.

315
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:06,604
All right, but there's a letter here
from Mr. Tod Newton.

316
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,150
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

317
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,844
- Newton. Tod Newton.
- Tod Newton.

318
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,687
- Show the lady in. Show the lady in.
- Yes, sir.

319
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,320
This Tod Newton has a lot of money.

320
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:20,987
Maybe we'll get some good costumes
after all.

321
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,327
My boy, you're learning the business.

322
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,260
Miss Barlow.

323
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,365
Miss Barlow. How do you do?

324
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:31,897
Why, this is wonderful.
Why didn't you come in before?

325
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:35,466
Well, your lady traffic cop out there
had the signals against me.

326
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,705
Oh, that's a shame. I'm sorry.

327
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,576
- It won't happen again, I assure you.
- Thank you.

328
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:40,979
- Won't you sit down?
- Yes, thank you.

329
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,983
<i>My son... I beg your pardon,
you haven't met my son.</i>

330
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,814
- How do you do?
- Mr. Bradley, Jr. Miss Barlow.

331
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,910
Hello.

332
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:48,889
Now, Miss Barlow, I think it would be best
if you'd see Mr. Gallagher at once.

333
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:51,152
- Yes, thank you.
- Junior, will you escort Miss Barlow...

334
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,126
- down to Mr. Gallagher on the stage?
- Thank you.

335
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:55,220
- Mr. Gallagher is our director.
- Oh, I know.

336
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,458
And we're always looking for fresh talent.

337
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:59,397
- You can sing and dance, I suppose?
- Yes, sir.

338
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:02,767
- But, Papa, how about her rhythm?
- That's Gallagher's job, not yours.

339
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:04,897
Tell him a dear friend of mine
sent Miss Barlow.

340
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:05,997
Thank you so much.

341
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,770
Now, Junior, be sure you take good care
of our little friend.

342
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,709
Let out on your long line a little bit,
will you?

343
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:12,303
When do you write your column, Ward?

344
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:14,781
You're always hanging around here
or some other dump.

345
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,580
- Well, it gets written, doesn't it?
- I wouldn't know.

346
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:19,813
I don't get much time to read gossip.

347
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,879
Speaking of gossip, what's new?

348
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,852
You ought to know.

349
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:29,285
I suppose you got that story about
one of our girls and the Ambassador?

350
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:31,332
No, no, what's that?

351
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,661
- Got a pencil around here?
- No, I haven't.

352
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:36,928
Well, never mind.

353
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:40,064
- When do you start rehearsals?
- Next Monday.

354
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:43,905
- Boy, I'd rather start boxing with Carnera.
- Here comes love!

355
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,948
- Hello, Ward.
- The rest of the name is King, my son.

356
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:49,245
That's all right. Call me Junior.

357
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:51,785
A very important friend of Papa's
sent a girl around for you.

358
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:54,686
Papa wants you to take care of her.
She's outside.

359
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,058
I get it. One of those.

360
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,594
So Papa wants me
to give her a tryout, huh?

361
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,458
- Steve. Steve!
- Yeah, boss. Yeah.

362
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:07,434
Steve, a very important friend of Papa's...

363
00:23:07,502 --> 00:23:11,802
has brought around a very important
young lady for a very important tryout.

364
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:15,934
- Have you got any?
- Yes. I think we just have one left.

365
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:18,943
Steve will take care of her.

366
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,114
- The old brush off?
- Yeah, that's the way it goes.

367
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,481
These very important friends...

368
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:25,110
who want to put their dames
in the front row...

369
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:27,417
so they can show their friends
how well they can pick them.

370
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,322
Say, who is this very important friend
of Papa's, anyhow?

371
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,451
You can just say a certain young man
in the money...

372
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:33,721
and you won't be very far wrong.

373
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,092
Fine, fine.

374
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,589
Oh, well, never mind.

375
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:40,794
Got your music?

376
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,368
Is that all I get, a piano?

377
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,868
The last audition I gave
I had a 40 piece orchestra.

378
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:49,137
All right, little lady,
we'll dig up Paul Whiteman for you.

379
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,508
- That'll be swell.
- Wait a minute.

380
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,479
If you want a tryout,
get your rehearsal clothes.

381
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:55,345
- I didn't bring any with me.
- The wardrobe lady will give them to you.

382
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,248
- Okay, boss. Okay.
- Hurry up.

383
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:00,744
Do you want Junior to help you?

384
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,325
No, thanks.
Junior has enough to do to dress himself.

385
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,324
Hey, you mugs! Come here.

386
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,595
Okay, boss.

387
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:13,964
- Listen, fellows.
- What's the matter?

388
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,003
- We're going to have an audition.
- A raw edition?

389
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:18,164
No, an audition! You heard me.

390
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,730
- See that girl that went upstairs?
- Yeah.

391
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:20,968
We're going to give her the brush off.

392
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,066
- The brush off?
- Yeah.

393
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:24,203
- Same instruments.
- No instruments, we're going to sing.

394
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:29,080
<i>Oh, you'll never know</i>

395
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:33,850
<i>Just what you start</i>

396
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:35,688
You start with me, I'll break...

397
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:37,156
- That was a B flat?
- Yeah.

398
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,249
- Sing it.
- Yeah.

399
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:40,226
What do you know about music?

400
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:42,557
You're talking to one of the best musicians
in the country!

401
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:44,326
How are you in the city?

402
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,191
<i>Oh, you</i>

403
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:47,667
Boys, listen, I'm wrong.

404
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,465
We're not gonna sing it,
we're gonna play it.

405
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,597
Get the instruments.
You heard me, didn't you?

406
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:54,039
- We could sing it.
- You know I'm the boss, don't you?

407
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,406
- Get organized now, come on.
- Okay.

408
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:57,206
- Get the chairs. Get organized.
- Okay.

409
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,576
- You ready? Right.
- Right.

410
00:24:58,647 --> 00:24:59,539
- Right.
- Right.

411
00:24:59,814 --> 00:25:01,042
- Right.
- Right.

412
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:03,016
Stop. Stop. Everything's all right, isn't it?

413
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,676
- Yeah.
- I'm going to count off.

414
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,017
- One, two.
- Button your shoe.

415
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,680
- Three, four.
- Close the door.

416
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,486
- Five, six.
- Brush her off.

417
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,153
Hey, here she comes now.

418
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:14,695
All right, fellows.
Come on. Get organized.

419
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,923
Right. Right.

420
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:18,591
- What can we do for you?
- Well, what have you got?

421
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,430
- We got plenty.
- All right, let me have it.

422
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:21,867
I'll need a little more room, though.

423
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,734
You'll get it. All right, fellows, break it up.

424
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:24,931
Spread out!

425
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:30,408
That's it.

426
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:37,208
- Faster, please.
- Faster, the lady wants it faster.

427
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,250
Slower.

428
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,017
Slower. Give it to her slower.

429
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:49,357
Help the lady out.
Help the lady out, will you.

430
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:50,589
That's it.

431
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:54,424
- All right, a little step on now, fellows.
- Careful. Sit down, fellows, sit down.

432
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:57,369
Say, Curly, help the lady out, will you?

433
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:08,609
Okay, boys, I get it. It's the brush off, huh?

434
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,106
Okay.

435
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:24,161
All right, hold it a minute, will you?

436
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,762
Okay, bruiser, the first round's yours,
but I'm not licked yet.

437
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:32,738
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, will you?

438
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:36,938
Say, listen, Paderewski...

439
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:39,443
do them funny noises come out of you
or the piano?

440
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:42,113
Boss, come here, will you?
Boss, come here!

441
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,481
- What do you want?
- Boss, come here.

442
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:46,281
This girl's got plenty of talent.

443
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,584
Oh, Steve, don't be like that.
I'm busy, I haven't...

444
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:50,716
You got confidence in me, haven't you?

445
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,453
Look, come on with me, will you?

446
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,690
All right, all right,
we've got nothing to lose. Come on.

447
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:59,924
Very, very clever. There she is.

448
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:02,228
Oh, you.

449
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:05,964
- Get her out of here.
- Wait a minute, boss.

450
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,941
- Steve, I haven't...
- Boss, she's got plenty of talent!

451
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:09,840
Listen to me,
just watch her once, will you, please?

452
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:11,572
All right, let's see what you can do.

453
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:12,704
Steve, same instruments?

454
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,773
Get out of here. Take those chairs
and get out of here. Get out of here.

455
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,080
This is on the level, now, play it,
don't fake it!

456
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:19,313
Go ahead.

457
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:50,281
Say, Junior,
you don't happen to know the name...

458
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:52,115
of that important friend of Papa's, do you?

459
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,484
Sure, I know.

460
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:55,283
Got a pencil?

461
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,948
No.

462
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:03,264
- Well, don't you want to know his name?
- No, no, let it ride.

463
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:17,209
All right.
Report for rehearsal next Monday.

464
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,906
- Oh, Mr. Gallagher...
- And don't follow me anymore!

465
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:20,970
Yes, sir.

466
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,277
Steve, stick her in the front line
with the Closser unit.

467
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:25,478
Yeah, boss.

468
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,552
You sure have got rhythm, baby.

469
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:32,319
Yeah, well, keep your hands off it.

470
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:41,328
What is this?

471
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:44,167
Can't you quit shadowing me
now that you've got your job?

472
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,605
I'm not shadowing you now,
Mr. Gallagher...

473
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:49,142
I just wanted to thank you for the break.

474
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:51,502
All right, all right, thank me.

475
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:56,309
You may not think it's such a break
when I get through working you.

476
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:58,443
Listen, I've been through the mill already.

477
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,422
Why, I've worked in cheap vaudeville,
one night stands, honky-tonks, burlesque...

478
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,152
Well, what do you want?
To be made an Eagle Girl Scout for it?

479
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:07,319
I've been through the mill, too.
I've played honky-tonks.

480
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,920
But that isn't it.
It's just that you can't scare me away...

481
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,762
from my first break
by threatening to work me.

482
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,802
- You like to dance?
- Oh, I love it.

483
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:17,497
Well, it's good you do.
You may be a natural, you may be a flop.

484
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:18,561
You can't ever tell.

485
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,904
- Takes years and years of hard work.
- I'm not afraid of work.

486
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,067
- Takes guts and brains.
- Yeah, I know.

487
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,543
After you've given everything
maybe something will come of it.

488
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:27,274
- Maybe nothing.
- Something's got to come of it.

489
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,610
- I suppose if you feel you got it, you got it.
- Yeah.

490
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,711
- You like to dance?
- More than anything in the world.

491
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:35,585
- You want to work with me?
- Yes, Mr. Gallagher.

492
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,147
- Shake.
- Yes, sir.

493
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:39,193
- Now, beat it!
- Thank you!

494
00:29:57,812 --> 00:30:00,337
How about a little drink
to our partnership, Mr. Newton?

495
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:01,507
All right.

496
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:07,482
Now remember, this is just a
private deal between you and me.

497
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,388
My friends wouldn't understand
an investment of this kind.

498
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:13,222
They don't want me contaminated
by show people.

499
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:16,260
It's Q.T. With me. I won't tell a soul.

500
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:19,061
By the way, do these girls
get paid during rehearsals?

501
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,725
Well, not as a rule.

502
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:23,999
But in Miss Barlow's case,
I think it could be arranged.

503
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,937
Fine, charge it to me.

504
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,338
<i>But don't say anything about it to...</i>

505
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:32,839
Or anybody.

506
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:43,354
- Well, here we are.
- Thanks.

507
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:46,224
Hey, look, would it be all right
if I gave a little party...

508
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:48,091
for the whole company tomorrow night?

509
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:50,790
Why the whole company, Mr. Newton?

510
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:53,800
Well, I've tried working it alone,
doesn't seem to get very far.

511
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:57,065
I see. It might work better
in a crowd, huh?

512
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,239
But don't expect Gallagher.

513
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:02,367
When he's directing a show,
he never goes out.

514
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,603
That's okay.

515
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,611
This is one show I'll direct myself.

516
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,501
<i>The more I'm with you, the more I can see</i>

517
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:36,101
<i>My love is yours alone</i>

518
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:41,445
<i>You came and captured
a heart that was free</i>

519
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:46,647
<i>Now I've nothing I can call my own</i>

520
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,289
<i>Everything I have is yours</i>

521
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,626
<i>You're part of me</i>

522
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:01,898
<i>Everything I have is yours</i>

523
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,302
<i>My destiny</i>

524
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:11,108
<i>I would gladly give the sun to you</i>

525
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:15,943
<i>If the sun were only mine</i>

526
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:20,254
<i>I would gladly give the earth to you</i>

527
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:24,951
<i>And the stars that shine</i>

528
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:31,564
<i>Everything that I possess, I offer you</i>

529
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,000
<i>That my dream of happiness come true</i>

530
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:47,809
<i>I'd be happy just to spend my life</i>

531
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:53,182
<i>Waiting at your beck and call</i>

532
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:56,815
<i>Everything I have is yours</i>

533
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,052
<i>My life</i>

534
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,426
<i>My all</i>

535
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:08,960
Goody, goody, champagne.

536
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:12,564
You know, this is my first time
to one of these doggy parties in years.

537
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,164
They're all right.

538
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,540
And at that, I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for Janie.

539
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:18,511
She made me stop hoofing
and start cooking.

540
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,070
We got a little joint around the corner
from Broadway.

541
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,913
Broadway isn't what it used to be
in the old days, you know.

542
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:28,718
Churchill's, Reisenweber's,
the old Madison Square Garden, all gone.

543
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,848
I heard of them.

544
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,619
Did you know New York
when they was here?

545
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,821
<i>No, I was working
on the Kansas City Star in those days.</i>

546
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:40,024
- Do you like gardenias?
- I love them.

547
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,333
I could take you in my yacht to Tahiti
where they grow wild, millions of them.

548
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:48,441
- Hoping I'd go wild, too, huh?
- Might do you a world of good, Janie.

549
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:51,739
Tod, dance me toward the bedroom,
will you?

550
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,177
I want to get my coat.

551
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,616
I'm going home.

552
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,278
Come on, let's dance.

553
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,752
You think you're a dancer, huh?

554
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:08,455
You'll never be an artist
until you find out what life's about.

555
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:11,498
You ought to open up
an art school for chorus girls.

556
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,035
Oh, excuse us.

557
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,448
There goes your great artist.

558
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,997
Is this the only way
I can get you in my arms?

559
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:56,276
- Janie?
- Yes, Tod?

560
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,073
Is it?

561
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,538
No.

562
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,439
We can always dance.

563
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:09,348
What are you doing with me, a striptease?

564
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:13,051
Tod!

565
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,499
Janie.

566
00:35:29,277 --> 00:35:30,767
I must go home, Tod.

567
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,670
You sure about that?

568
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:41,448
Sure.

569
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:48,659
They were all at the party last night...

570
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:52,529
just because you said they could
stay in bed and rest up this morning.

571
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,797
- They were in bed all right.
- All right, Steve, I know all about it.

572
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,065
I can't play nursemaid to a hundred girls.

573
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,165
If they're tired for rehearsal this afternoon,
that's their hard luck!

574
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,177
- I'll be up in the gym.
- Listen, boss, I want to ask you something.

575
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,770
What's the matter? Sore because
you weren't asked to the party?

576
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:10,045
No, not exactly that,
but tell me, why am I a social failure?

577
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:13,109
- Ask your best friend.
- Even he won't tell me!

578
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,194
Wait a minute, what is all this?
What are you doing up here?

579
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,402
Oh, it's you.

580
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,466
I might have known wherever there's
anything private I'd find you around.

581
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:38,034
I just sneaked up to get a little workout.

582
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:42,274
What's the matter, the one at the party
last night wasn't so good, huh?

583
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:44,679
If you're so interested
in our private affairs...

584
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:46,151
why don't you come and see?

585
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,347
I don't mix business with pleasure.

586
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:51,619
Well, it'd be a pleasure to me
if you'd mind your own business.

587
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:53,091
Yeah? Say, listen.

588
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:57,188
It's my business to see
that you gals keep your shapes, Duchess!

589
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:02,794
You mean,
to see that we don't give them away.

590
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,345
Listen...

591
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:25,288
I don't give a rap about your private life,
only as to how it affects me.

592
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,725
Then stop handing out sarcastic orders.

593
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,332
It doesn't affect you at all.

594
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:37,932
Say listen, did you ever take a look at a
dame who's been out too many nights?

595
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,473
The customers out front just love it.

596
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,476
Will you stop beefing.
You're not on the stage now.

597
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:48,509
- Why don't you watch yourself?
- Why don't you...

598
00:37:57,892 --> 00:37:59,052
Feel better?

599
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:09,295
Well, what do you know about that?

600
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,435
He can actually smile.

601
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,781
You look nice when you smile.

602
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:26,513
Why don't you try it a little more often?

603
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:28,748
Come on. Come on. Play ball.

604
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:30,688
Okay, you asked for it.

605
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:36,586
- Say, are you doing that on purpose?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

606
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,740
Pretty ambitious, huh?
Getting up so early after a night out.

607
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,778
- A lot of sleep'd done you more good.
- I left early.

608
00:38:56,851 --> 00:39:00,082
Yeah? Well, keep up the good work.

609
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:04,483
Maybe I'll give you a specialty number
all for yourself.

610
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,390
- Gee, really?
- Save it. Save it.

611
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,493
You haven't got it yet.

612
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,171
- Shoulder feel all right now?
- It feels swell when you rub it.

613
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,266
Oh, no, you don't.

614
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,013
It was nice you could get away.

615
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:35,852
Yeah. Mr. Gallagher traded me
the afternoon for working all night.

616
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:37,447
That was kind of him.

617
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:41,893
I nearly forgot. Got something for you.

618
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:46,896
- I only owe you $25 now.
- Are you still at it?

619
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:50,596
Until the last dime is paid, Shylock.

620
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,310
Tod, I'm scared.

621
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:02,983
Come on, now. Just be yourself.

622
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:07,118
And remember, don't bite or scratch
no matter what happens.

623
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:10,283
Go on, now. Don't worry.

624
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:19,127
Gee, this is a swell... place.

625
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:30,102
- Who's that?
- That's one of the early Newtons.

626
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:32,876
He fought in the Revolution.

627
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:35,142
Looks like he started it.

628
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:38,515
You talking about those
darned old Newtons again?

629
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:42,651
He blew the top of his head off
with a duck gun.

630
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:46,250
You never heard of anything like that
from my side of the family.

631
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:50,859
This is my grandmother
on my mother's side. Mrs. Todhunter.

632
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,957
She's quite deaf, but she's the real thing.

633
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:57,035
- Nanny, this is Janie Barlow.
- What?

634
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:59,939
I'll have to write it for her.

635
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:04,377
So a Newton's
brought a woman into this house finally.

636
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:09,344
This is Janie Barlow.

637
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:13,651
Nice girl, isn't she?

638
00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:15,588
When's the wedding?

639
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:19,258
<i>Oh, but you...</i>

640
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:21,419
Now, there's no use answering her.

641
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:27,901
Looks like good, healthy stock.

642
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:31,230
You know, Tod,
I didn't think you had it in you.

643
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:33,830
You know, we Todhunters
knew how to pick the women.

644
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,968
It was the Newtons
who were always a bit finicky.

645
00:41:37,278 --> 00:41:39,405
- All right, darling, all right.
- Well, they were.

646
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,675
You know, I know what I'm talking about.

647
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,546
- Tod!
- Hello, kid.

648
00:41:43,617 --> 00:41:45,642
I thought I heard your car.

649
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:48,153
Janie Barlow, this is my sister, Grace.

650
00:41:48,222 --> 00:41:50,247
- How do you do?
- Hello.

651
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:53,691
- I'm so glad to know you.
- Thanks.

652
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,559
- And that's all the family there is.
- Tod!

653
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,927
Yes, Nanny.

654
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,558
Well, don't yell like that. I ain't so deaf.

655
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:05,270
You know you might have telephoned.
I could have prepared a little.

656
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,466
- All we want is a swim.
- Him?

657
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,974
- What him? Who?
- A swim.

658
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:10,476
Why didn't you say so?

659
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:13,308
I'll have Charles fix something
down at the lake.

660
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:17,746
- You like it?
- Love it.

661
00:42:17,818 --> 00:42:19,945
- Afraid?
- Of what?

662
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,180
The country.

663
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:24,080
- I'm used to it.
- How so?

664
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:27,323
I milked a cow once.

665
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:30,795
What kind of a cow was it,
a Jersey or Guernsey?

666
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:33,560
I don't know. I didn't see the license plate.

667
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:36,932
Gee, this is a swell place.

668
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:39,067
You got everything in it.

669
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:41,741
All you need's a piano.

670
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,804
How'd you like to look
for a house and furniture?

671
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,278
Let's talk sense.

672
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:49,340
We want to be friends.

673
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:52,010
We can't be
unless you keep it on a sensible basis.

674
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:53,986
I'm suggesting a dandy basis.

675
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:56,113
Here, drink some of this.

676
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,420
Maybe it'll make you see things
the way I do.

677
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,686
No, thanks.

678
00:43:00,694 --> 00:43:02,992
Everything's beautiful just as it is.

679
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:08,566
- Come on in.
- I don't like to mix my drinks.

680
00:43:20,748 --> 00:43:21,874
The water's nice.

681
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:24,577
All right, you take the exercise
for both of us.

682
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:25,812
Come on in.

683
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:33,590
For a guy that's had as much practice
as you, you're a pretty poor shot.

684
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:34,787
Is that so?

685
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,129
Mr. Newton.

686
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:47,538
This is so sudden.

687
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:49,405
I learned that in the Navy.

688
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:52,575
I'll have to get myself a diver's suit.

689
00:43:52,646 --> 00:43:55,774
You'll never get one
to fit you like the one you got on.

690
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,817
You know, you're too versatile
to be working just on land.

691
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,377
Why don't you find yourself
a nice mermaid?

692
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:04,958
I've tried mermaids.
They can't dance well enough.

693
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:06,822
And I dance and that's all.

694
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,294
It can't be very much fun for you...

695
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:12,264
going around with a girl
whose dancing is her career.

696
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,733
There are other careers besides dancing.

697
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,829
- Not for me.
- Marriage is a career.

698
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:22,472
- Marriage?
- Sure.

699
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:25,944
I'll buy a ring and a license
if it'll make everything cozier.

700
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,914
I didn't know you meant that, Tod.

701
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:32,383
Neither did I. It just occurred to me
down there in the water.

702
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:34,810
Sold?

703
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:38,347
No.

704
00:44:39,526 --> 00:44:42,893
- I don't want to marry.
- You mean, you don't want to marry me.

705
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,995
I don't want to promise
to marry anyone yet, Tod.

706
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:49,627
I've got a job to go through with first.

707
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:53,230
- Not very much of a job is it?
- I don't know. Might be.

708
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:58,409
Mr. Gallagher's promised me
a chance at a specialty number.

709
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:02,175
And if I make good at that
and the show's a big hit...

710
00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:06,280
it would mean everything to me.

711
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:09,584
And what if the show isn't a hit
or if you don't make good?

712
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,017
<i>Well, then I guess...</i>

713
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:17,825
It's got to be a hit.

714
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:21,027
I'll never get such a chance again.

715
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:25,595
- My whole career depends on it.
- Your whole dancing career, you mean.

716
00:45:27,274 --> 00:45:28,263
Well.

717
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,876
Janie, suppose this big job of yours
turns out to be not so big as you think...

718
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:36,477
would you marry me then?

719
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:41,481
We love each other enough, don't we?

720
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,255
<i>I think so, Tod, but...</i>

721
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:54,862
The only "but" is whether or not
the show gets over.

722
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:58,803
If it does, you stick to show business.
If it doesn't, you stick to me.

723
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,465
For life.

724
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,542
Please say yes.

725
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:12,043
Please.

726
00:46:24,022 --> 00:46:27,219
Hey, look what Ward King says
in his column.

727
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:31,428
"It is rumored that one of the new girls
in the forthcoming Bradley production...

728
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,488
"soon will go to the altar
with a gay blade...

729
00:46:33,565 --> 00:46:36,193
"from the social register section
of our town."

730
00:46:36,268 --> 00:46:38,065
What does she do, hypnotize them?

731
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:40,571
- What has that Barlow dame got?
- Eyes, that's all.

732
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,004
Can't do it with eyes, my dear.

733
00:46:42,074 --> 00:46:43,974
Maybe she's got a book that tells about it.

734
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:46,237
I've tried everything but a blackjack.

735
00:46:46,311 --> 00:46:49,803
I'm going to talk to Papa
about you tonight. Anything I say goes.

736
00:46:49,882 --> 00:46:52,749
Break it up. Get out of the nursery.
You, get in your overalls.

737
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:54,285
Say, do you realize
to whom you're speaking?

738
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,911
I'm democratic, I speak to everybody.

739
00:46:55,988 --> 00:46:59,583
- I'll speak to Papa about you.
- Go on, you big tom-boy.

740
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,892
All right, girls, on your feet.
Come on, everybody.

741
00:47:03,162 --> 00:47:05,357
- The Duchess!
- Yeah, that's right.

742
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:07,763
- You know we got a rehearsal today?
- Have we?

743
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,801
Steve, this is my roommate, Rosie LaRue.

744
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,859
- Take good care of her, will you?
- She needs it.

745
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:14,303
- I'll be down in a minute, Rosie.
- Okay.

746
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:17,034
Say, I remember you.

747
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,607
The third girl from the left
in the Florodora Sextette.

748
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,977
You want a wheelchair?

749
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,778
No, thanks.
I'll just take one of your crutches.

750
00:47:28,954 --> 00:47:31,889
- Morning, Cyclone.
- The Duchess.

751
00:47:33,592 --> 00:47:35,025
- All right, Steve.
- All right, boss.

752
00:47:35,093 --> 00:47:37,891
<i>Let's get going. Get the girls down
for the Bavarian number, will you?</i>

753
00:47:37,963 --> 00:47:39,328
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Goodbye, handsome.

754
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,956
What, are you getting sentimental?

755
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:44,969
<i>All right, girls, the Bavarian number!
Quiet! Girls, quiet!</i>

756
00:47:46,038 --> 00:47:47,699
Come on, girls, Mr. Gallagher's waiting.

757
00:47:47,773 --> 00:47:50,333
- Why don't you knock?
- What for? You ain't got nothing to hide.

758
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,775
Come on, girls, everybody. Come on, now.

759
00:47:58,383 --> 00:48:00,749
Come on, stop that kidding.
Stop that playing cards.

760
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:03,549
Come on. Come on, girls, everybody down.
Come on, the beer number.

761
00:48:03,622 --> 00:48:04,884
Come on, girls.

762
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,790
What's the matter with you?
Stop that, will you?

763
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,918
Take this, will you?

764
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:12,159
Everything will be ready
in a minute, Mr. Gallagher.

765
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:14,529
- All right, Steve.
- All right, girls, come on.

766
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,465
Come on. On your feet, everybody now.
Come on.

767
00:48:16,535 --> 00:48:17,900
Jessie, take care of these girls, will you?

768
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,803
All right, come on, girls, the beer number.

769
00:48:24,743 --> 00:48:26,040
Hello, Duchess.

770
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,706
Hello, Mr. G. How many nip-ups today?
I feel pretty light on my feet.

771
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,976
Yeah, how did you get that way?

772
00:48:32,384 --> 00:48:34,875
The session in the speakeasies last night?

773
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:39,481
No. A nice, quiet evening in the open.

774
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,685
Trees and a lake and all that sort of thing.

775
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,958
- Out with the rich folks?
- Just one rich folk!

776
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:49,757
One's usually enough.

777
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:53,260
Do you think you could bring yourself
down to do a little work now?

778
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:54,362
Let's go.

779
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,702
- Oh, democratic, too?
- Yeah!

780
00:48:58,043 --> 00:48:59,442
If you'd told us where you were...

781
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:01,911
we'd have brought the company out there
to rehearse.

782
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,973
- Come on, Steve, let's have it.
- All right, Miss Warner, this is for you.

783
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:09,680
- Hey, give me a pickup.
- All right, come on, girls.

784
00:49:09,755 --> 00:49:11,245
Hey, listen, boys...

785
00:49:11,957 --> 00:49:13,754
- you're the authors of this show?
- Yeah.

786
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,486
- Do you like it?
- I think it's splendid.

787
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:16,721
- Certainly.
- It looks great.

788
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:19,764
Well, that's too bad.
Because it's going to be changed.

789
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,891
- You can't do that without our say-so.
- We've got our rights.

790
00:49:22,968 --> 00:49:24,026
It's in our contract.

791
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:26,366
It's in my contract,
that I don't have to put on a turkey!

792
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:27,564
What I say goes.

793
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:32,076
Mr. Gallagher, I might say I've been
expecting something like this.

794
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:34,576
Now, don't irritate Pinky.
You know how he is.

795
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:35,772
Sure, sure. I know how he is.

796
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,678
I had a cousin like him once.
We had to shoot him.

797
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:39,808
What's wrong, Mr. Gallagher?
What's wrong? Tell us that.

798
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:41,284
You tell me what's right.

799
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,583
The whole thing's terrible.
It all has to be re-written.

800
00:49:43,655 --> 00:49:45,179
You're crucifying me!

801
00:49:45,257 --> 00:49:47,088
Now, don't get excited, Pinky.
He isn't worth it.

802
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:48,649
Don't go to pieces, Pinky.
Don't go to pieces!

803
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:51,025
Oh, come on, come on.
Get back on your nest.

804
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:55,226
Then just what is your idea, Mr. Patch?

805
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,291
My idea would be to write
a whole new show.

806
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,667
- Oh! You're crucifying me.
- Now, listen!

807
00:49:59,738 --> 00:50:02,707
This show as it stands
is Spanish-American War stuff.

808
00:50:02,808 --> 00:50:05,834
Country girl, city slicker,
oatmeal, butterflies!

809
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:07,936
You can't get by
with that sort of thing today!

810
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:10,004
You gotta give them something
out of modern everyday life.

811
00:50:10,082 --> 00:50:12,243
- Something out of the city streets.
- I'll kill myself.

812
00:50:12,317 --> 00:50:14,751
Give them the slums, burlesque shows,
riveting machines.

813
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,913
A girl who has to beat time
to the city's rhythm.

814
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:18,718
A girl who craves to dance. Do you get it?

815
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:22,317
- How can Vivian Warner do that?
- Vivian Warner isn't going to do it!

816
00:50:23,662 --> 00:50:26,187
- All right, break it up, break it up!
- Break it up, break it up!

817
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:30,968
- Barlow?
- Yes, sir.

818
00:50:31,703 --> 00:50:34,297
In my office.
I've got a few things to say to you.

819
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:35,431
Yes, sir.

820
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:37,897
Steve.

821
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,940
Finish this and tell them all except Warner
to be back here at 8.00 tonight.

822
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:47,542
- You don't want Warner?
- No, without Warner.

823
00:50:48,286 --> 00:50:50,720
Listen, everybody, we'll run through
this number once more...

824
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:52,313
and that'll be all for this afternoon.

825
00:50:52,391 --> 00:50:54,825
Mr. Bradley wants to see
Mr. Bradley, Jr. Right away.

826
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:56,383
It's very important.

827
00:50:57,863 --> 00:51:00,696
Babe. If you see Junior,
tell him Papa wants him.

828
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:03,290
Yes, sir. Papa wants you, Junior.

829
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,608
- I've been thinking things over.
- Yes, sir.

830
00:51:25,057 --> 00:51:26,957
You're through with the unit.

831
00:51:29,027 --> 00:51:31,461
Sorry I didn't make the grade,
Mr. Gallagher.

832
00:51:31,563 --> 00:51:33,326
- I worked awfully hard...
- That's right.

833
00:51:33,398 --> 00:51:34,990
That's why I'm taking you out of the unit.

834
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:36,932
- Why? Because I worked hard?
- No.

835
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,697
Because I want to put you on the top spot.

836
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,931
- The what?
- The top spot.

837
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,342
- Top spot?
- Yes, yes, yes, the top spot.

838
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:49,278
Where if you drop,
you've got twice as far to fall.

839
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,080
Well, maybe I'm a sap for trying it...

840
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,543
and maybe I can make something
out of you...

841
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,417
if you can stand up
when I get through with you.

842
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,616
I've got good legs, Mr. Gallagher.

843
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:03,790
Yes, so I've noticed.
But don't let them run away with you.

844
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,794
I won't. I'm sticking right here.

845
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,292
Well, don't. Go on home.

846
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:12,768
Clear all this stuff out of your mind
and be back here at 8:00 tonight.

847
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,266
Gee, I don't know what to say,
Mr. Gallagher.

848
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:20,568
- You don't know how much...
- Save it, save it.

849
00:52:21,546 --> 00:52:22,774
Yes, sir.

850
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,846
Shake?

851
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,587
- And now, will you...
- Beat it. Yeah, I know. I'll beat it.

852
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:46,767
<i>My dancing lady, there's nobody like you</i>

853
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,640
<i>You find such pleasure
in doing what you do</i>

854
00:52:53,979 --> 00:52:58,643
<i>A change in music and suddenly you start</i>

855
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:04,688
<i>That little syncopated beat in your heart</i>

856
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:09,984
<i>You look inspired
That's one of your great charms</i>

857
00:53:11,263 --> 00:53:16,132
<i>And when you're tired
start dancing in my arms</i>

858
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,893
<i>After a while, dear</i>

859
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:22,371
<i>These two happy feet
will beat down the aisle, dear</i>

860
00:53:22,507 --> 00:53:25,567
<i>My dancing lady to you</i>

861
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,976
<i>When I look at you in admiration</i>

862
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:32,575
<i>Wondering where I got the luck</i>

863
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,518
<i>Landing someone quite so grand</i>

864
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:38,285
<i>When so many folks get stuck</i>

865
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,324
<i>You're supply of everything that's needed</i>

866
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:44,419
<i>Just meets my demand</i>

867
00:53:44,729 --> 00:53:47,857
<i>Pardon if I seem to gush</i>

868
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:51,866
<i>But I say without a blush</i>

869
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:28,730
<i>After a while, dear</i>

870
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,332
<i>These two happy feet
will beat down the aisle, dear</i>

871
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:35,675
<i>My dancing lady, to you</i>

872
00:54:39,084 --> 00:54:41,484
All right, girls and boys,
come on, now break it up. That's all.

873
00:54:41,553 --> 00:54:44,420
All right, break it up, everybody.
Take a rest now.

874
00:54:54,633 --> 00:54:58,194
- What's the matter, cramp?
- A little. It's all right, though.

875
00:54:59,404 --> 00:55:01,429
- Routine on that number's not bad.
- Thanks.

876
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,634
- Needs a little cleaning up, though.
- You're telling me.

877
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,937
- Sure you're all right?
- Yes, sir.

878
00:55:08,747 --> 00:55:10,647
- Don't want to quit?
- No, sir.

879
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,511
Do you feel like going through
that opening number with Mr. Astaire?

880
00:55:13,585 --> 00:55:14,574
All right.

881
00:55:14,653 --> 00:55:15,677
- Freddy.
- Yes, Patch.

882
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:17,779
Show Miss Barlow the routine
on that opening number, will you?

883
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,289
- I'd love to.
- Good evening, Mr. Astaire.

884
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,257
Miss Barlow. Do you know the routine?

885
00:55:21,326 --> 00:55:23,954
- I've seen it often enough, I'll try.
- That's fine.

886
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,054
Harry, give us the pickup
on that gang number, would you, please.

887
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:27,393
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

888
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,472
How does that Barlow
get to take Warner's place?

889
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,944
Didn't you ever hear of personality?

890
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:05,626
- All right, girls, stand back, stand back!
- Help me take her in my office.

891
00:56:05,704 --> 00:56:06,796
Boss, I'll carry her.

892
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,271
- I always wanted to be a hero.
- Steve, take her in my office.

893
00:56:09,341 --> 00:56:11,571
Come on, girls, get back. Get back!

894
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:13,201
All right, Paley,
go ahead with that number.

895
00:56:13,278 --> 00:56:15,371
Come on, girls, now, snap into it.

896
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:17,074
Take her right in here.

897
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:23,617
- All right, get me the liniment, Jess.
- Yes, sir.

898
00:56:23,688 --> 00:56:25,849
- It's over there, Jess.
- Come on, let's get the shoe off.

899
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,223
- Oh, take it easy.
- Yeah, all right. There you are.

900
00:56:29,894 --> 00:56:31,725
Come on now, let's straighten it out.

901
00:56:31,796 --> 00:56:33,354
- Come on, let go.
- I can't.

902
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,262
Yes, you can. Come on, let go.

903
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:38,928
That's it. Oh, that's better. That's fine.

904
00:56:39,137 --> 00:56:40,627
- Give me the liniment, Jess.
- Yes, sir.

905
00:56:40,705 --> 00:56:42,866
- You know, I had a charley horse once.
- It hurt, didn't it?

906
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,409
- Certainly it hurt.
- There, is that better?

907
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:47,541
- All right, boys...
- Yeah.

908
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,704
...get them back to rehearsal.

909
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,577
- Shall I take them, Steve?
- No, I'll take them.

910
00:56:50,648 --> 00:56:52,548
- They got more confidence in me.
- Oh. Sorry.

911
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:56,077
Better keep it straight now. That's it.

912
00:56:56,521 --> 00:56:59,115
Come on, keep it straight.

913
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:03,917
This is going to hurt a little.

914
00:57:04,696 --> 00:57:06,687
Let it go easy now, right back.

915
00:57:08,066 --> 00:57:09,158
That's it.

916
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:14,103
Wriggle your toe.

917
00:57:26,284 --> 00:57:28,684
What kind of a gang are you running with?

918
00:57:28,753 --> 00:57:29,811
What do you mean?

919
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:32,914
I see a lot of cracks
in Ward King's column about you.

920
00:57:33,425 --> 00:57:36,451
It's no fun sitting at home all the time.

921
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:38,861
No, I suppose not.

922
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,797
What are you going to do,
marry into dough?

923
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:45,961
- I don't know.
- Well, don't do it.

924
00:57:49,274 --> 00:57:53,074
Those guys are a lot of silk hats
and silk socks with nothing between.

925
00:57:53,978 --> 00:57:57,470
That's what all these dames fall for.
Don't let it fool you.

926
00:57:58,216 --> 00:57:59,683
It never works out.

927
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:03,111
But...

928
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,713
Dancing is your racket, Duchess. I know it.

929
00:58:09,894 --> 00:58:11,919
I'm not going to run out on you.

930
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:16,427
I'm not getting married.

931
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:20,928
Is that on the level?

932
00:58:23,475 --> 00:58:24,464
Sure.

933
00:58:25,777 --> 00:58:27,506
You mean that, Duchess?

934
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,444
Sure, I mean it.

935
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:33,248
I'm not going to quit on you
after all you've done for me.

936
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:35,343
What do you take me for, anyway?

937
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:46,291
- You think you can make it now?
- Yes, sir.

938
00:58:51,603 --> 00:58:54,163
Well, all right, on your feet, on your feet.

939
00:59:04,482 --> 00:59:06,074
Sure you're all right?

940
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:11,383
Well, let's see you walk.

941
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,024
All right?

942
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,370
Well, what are you waiting for? Come on.

943
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:36,046
All right, Steve, come on.

944
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,014
<i>Get them in their places
for the Dancing Lady number.</i>

945
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:40,107
All right, boss.
Come on, girls. You heel-beaters.

946
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:41,709
Come on now. Come on, get up.

947
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,220
- Come on, now.
- Everybody, now, everybody.

948
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:49,216
- Come on, girls, please.
- Come on, move fast.

949
00:59:49,561 --> 00:59:52,826
All right, Harry, drop that puzzle.
Give me a pickup here.

950
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:12,143
All right, break it up, break it up!

951
01:00:13,418 --> 01:00:15,613
Just a minute. Come here, everybody.

952
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:19,152
This concerns you
so you may as well hear it now.

953
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:24,427
"Have decided to give up production
for this season owing to ill health.

954
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:25,518
"Stop.

955
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:29,093
"Am on way to South of France. Stop.

956
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,034
"Dismiss company immediately. Stop.

957
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:35,133
- "Junior sends best."
- Stop.

958
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:37,436
Signed, Jasper Bradley.

959
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,602
So, Junior sends best, a charming fellow.

960
01:00:46,818 --> 01:00:50,117
He can't mean that. He can't do that to us.

961
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,718
No? You don't know Jasper Bradley.

962
01:00:54,058 --> 01:00:58,927
- Isn't there anything we can do?
- Sure, we can go home and forget about it.

963
01:01:08,773 --> 01:01:10,968
I'm awful sorry, Mr. Gallagher.

964
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,074
Save it, Duchess, save it.

965
01:01:23,755 --> 01:01:25,586
What seems to be the matter?

966
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:28,855
We just got word,
they're closing the show.

967
01:01:28,926 --> 01:01:30,553
Oh, that's too bad.

968
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:39,033
I guess I'd better get out of these.
I look kind of silly in them now.

969
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:41,033
I'll be down in a minute.

970
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,838
Well, that takes care of the 40-hour-week,
all right.

971
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,707
My folks begged me
not to become an actress.

972
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:50,242
Your folks needn't worry, you didn't.

973
01:01:50,948 --> 01:01:52,313
You ready, Janie?

974
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:55,809
Yeah, I'm ready. And for what?

975
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,383
Well, it might be something pretty nice
if you just relax a little.

976
01:01:59,457 --> 01:02:01,015
I don't want to rush you into anything.

977
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,152
We'll talk about getting married
when we get back from the cruise.

978
01:02:04,228 --> 01:02:05,354
Cruise?

979
01:02:05,963 --> 01:02:08,363
Where are we cruising,
up and down Sixth Avenue?

980
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:11,800
No, Cuba. I thought a little sea air
might do you good.

981
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:15,803
And Grandma thought so, too.
She's coming along to chaperone...

982
01:02:15,873 --> 01:02:18,000
or maybe you'll chaperone Grandma.

983
01:02:18,543 --> 01:02:20,841
And you can bring anyone along
you'd like to.

984
01:02:20,912 --> 01:02:23,380
Rosette, if you want, in case I bore you.

985
01:02:23,915 --> 01:02:26,679
Rosette would love Cuba or vice versa.

986
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:30,982
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

987
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,483
- I want to see Patch.
- All right.

988
01:02:38,996 --> 01:02:40,361
Come in. Come in.

989
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:53,767
Oh, it's you. I thought you'd gone.

990
01:02:55,446 --> 01:02:58,711
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciated everything...

991
01:02:58,783 --> 01:03:00,774
even though it didn't work out.

992
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:02,709
Oh, that's all right.

993
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:06,082
I've been in this racket for years.

994
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:09,455
If you don't get a good break,
you get a bad one.

995
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,852
That's show business.

996
01:03:17,268 --> 01:03:18,997
What are you going to do?

997
01:03:20,271 --> 01:03:23,172
- Keep a promise.
- Marriage?

998
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:25,998
Maybe.

999
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,469
I get it.

1000
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:49,429
Well, goodbye.

1001
01:03:51,102 --> 01:03:55,095
- Goodbye. Lots of luck.
- Thanks, I'll be seeing you.

1002
01:03:57,341 --> 01:03:58,672
Sure, sure.

1003
01:03:59,977 --> 01:04:02,537
We'll sit around the fire, whittle sticks...

1004
01:04:03,347 --> 01:04:06,578
and talk about a girl
who traded Broadway for Park Avenue.

1005
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,584
You shouldn't have said that, Patch.

1006
01:04:15,793 --> 01:04:17,954
No, no, I shouldn't have said that.

1007
01:04:19,664 --> 01:04:23,760
I shouldn't have said anything to you
but "beat it," the day you came in here.

1008
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:33,202
Why did you say that to me, Patch?

1009
01:04:36,113 --> 01:04:37,603
I won't go this way.

1010
01:04:37,882 --> 01:04:39,406
I couldn't leave knowing the way you feel.

1011
01:04:39,484 --> 01:04:42,419
Oh, get out of here,
I told you to beat it, didn't I?

1012
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:45,581
I can't go.

1013
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,622
I don't want you to think
I'm letting you down.

1014
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:56,291
Please.

1015
01:05:08,145 --> 01:05:09,407
Okay, Duchess.

1016
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,080
Better luck with his show
than you had with mine.

1017
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,109
Thanks.

1018
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:26,021
You ready?

1019
01:05:43,447 --> 01:05:45,347
Not a bad jill at that, boss.

1020
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,182
- What?
- The girl.

1021
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:03,091
Well, boss, looks like
we're heading for the warehouse.

1022
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:09,562
Yeah?

1023
01:06:10,575 --> 01:06:12,736
- Well, we're not.
- What do you mean?

1024
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:16,038
Listen, Steve, Bradley can't do this to me.

1025
01:06:16,113 --> 01:06:18,274
I'm going to carry this show myself.
I'm gonna produce it.

1026
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,510
I got some dough,
and what I haven't got, I'll get.

1027
01:06:20,585 --> 01:06:22,746
I'll hock my car, my clothes,
my house, everything.

1028
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,414
That's great. And I got some money
I've been hoarding...

1029
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:27,787
against the next depression
and you can have every dime of it!

1030
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,088
- All right, drag it out. Get ahold of Warner.
- Okay, boss.

1031
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:33,619
- Warner? How about that Barlow dame?
- Oh, let her go! She's gone Park Avenue.

1032
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,995
Say, listen, Steve, from now on...

1033
01:06:35,066 --> 01:06:37,466
this is one theater
those guys get into only on a ticket.

1034
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,901
Get those people back for rehearsal
tomorrow morning as usual.

1035
01:06:39,971 --> 01:06:42,872
That's great, boss.
Girls, girls, don't go way. Girls!

1036
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,674
Hey, Grandma, here's mud in your eye.

1037
01:07:22,113 --> 01:07:25,048
Pie? Who wants pie in a place like this?

1038
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:28,716
Grandma, you're getting to be a cut-up.

1039
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,984
Having fun?

1040
01:07:44,001 --> 01:07:45,525
That's a swell dance.

1041
01:07:46,237 --> 01:07:50,503
- It's a little bit uncivilized, though.
- Maybe that's why it's so beautiful.

1042
01:07:51,308 --> 01:07:53,503
<i>It isn't loaded down by a lot of...</i>

1043
01:07:55,746 --> 01:07:58,078
- Drop it.
- Okay.

1044
01:07:58,582 --> 01:08:02,678
- Where do we go from here?
- Tod, let's go home.

1045
01:08:03,688 --> 01:08:05,019
- New York?
- Yeah.

1046
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:24,897
<i>That's the rhythm of the day</i>

1047
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,502
- All right, break it up, break it up!
- Break it up, break it up!

1048
01:08:30,448 --> 01:08:32,416
- Warner.
- Yes, Mr. Gallagher.

1049
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:35,819
I just wanted to make sure that you
understood this is a dancing number.

1050
01:08:35,886 --> 01:08:37,911
- I was under the impression I was dancing.
- Yeah?

1051
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,957
Well, that just shows how we can all
get the wrong impression sometimes.

1052
01:08:41,025 --> 01:08:42,014
My mistake!

1053
01:08:42,093 --> 01:08:43,526
That's not your first mistake,
Mr. Gallagher.

1054
01:08:43,594 --> 01:08:45,858
- No. My first mistake was...
- Was what?

1055
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,726
Oh, let it go, let it go.
Start at it again, Steve.

1056
01:08:51,802 --> 01:08:53,929
- Listen, boss.
- Steve, I'm not gonna stand for that!

1057
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:57,735
- I'll quit, so help me, I'll quit!
- Miss Warner, he's a little tired.

1058
01:08:57,808 --> 01:08:59,799
You know the show can't get on
without you.

1059
01:08:59,877 --> 01:09:02,072
You're an absolute sensation.

1060
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:09,610
- Well, I'll give him just one more chance.
- Thanks. You're a brick.

1061
01:09:13,924 --> 01:09:15,050
Come on.

1062
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:18,651
Say, I got a letter here
from Junior Bradley.

1063
01:09:18,996 --> 01:09:21,021
And I guess it's down at the office.

1064
01:09:21,098 --> 01:09:24,693
Anyway, he said that before his old man
blew out on the show...

1065
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:28,397
you were going to put the Barlow girl
into Miss Warner's place.

1066
01:09:28,472 --> 01:09:29,837
Anything in that?

1067
01:09:31,008 --> 01:09:34,705
- Oh, what difference does it make now?
- Well, it don't make sense.

1068
01:09:36,614 --> 01:09:38,241
What don't make sense?

1069
01:09:38,315 --> 01:09:41,079
<i>Well, he said...
Gosh, I wish I had that letter.</i>

1070
01:09:41,585 --> 01:09:45,077
Well, anyway, he said that the reason
his old man blew out on the show...

1071
01:09:45,156 --> 01:09:48,284
was that Tod Newton
paid him a lot of money to close it.

1072
01:09:53,497 --> 01:09:54,589
What?

1073
01:09:55,466 --> 01:09:58,492
- Say that again, I don't follow.
- Well, neither do I.

1074
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,867
Now, look,
the Barlow girl is Newton's sweetie.

1075
01:10:01,972 --> 01:10:04,600
So, why should he buy out a show
and close it...

1076
01:10:04,675 --> 01:10:08,736
and take her away to Cuba
just as she's about to get a good break?

1077
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,847
Doesn't make sense.

1078
01:10:13,517 --> 01:10:15,951
Yeah. It makes sense all right.

1079
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,852
Well, I guess there's something about it
I don't understand.

1080
01:10:20,457 --> 01:10:21,856
You figure it out.

1081
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,796
- Steve.
- Yeah, boss. Yeah.

1082
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:39,401
Take over this rehearsal.
I'm going out and get a drink.

1083
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:42,775
Oh, boss, I can't handle this.
You got a hippodrome here.

1084
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:44,974
Do whatever you want to do with it.
I don't care.

1085
01:10:45,049 --> 01:10:48,177
Boss, listen, please.
We got a dress rehearsal coming up.

1086
01:10:48,385 --> 01:10:51,013
- We open in a week.
- A week?

1087
01:10:51,989 --> 01:10:54,355
- Lucky if we open at all.
- But, boss.

1088
01:11:06,604 --> 01:11:08,970
<i>I see they're opening Dancing Lady
cold tomorrow night.</i>

1089
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:12,202
- Maybe it's something hot.
- Maybe it's shortage of dough.

1090
01:11:28,425 --> 01:11:30,256
Champagne cocktails, six.

1091
01:11:30,461 --> 01:11:32,361
None for me, Tod. I'm not thirsty.

1092
01:11:32,429 --> 01:11:34,420
I get it.
When a lady says she isn't thirsty...

1093
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,693
she means all she can drink
is champagne cocktails.

1094
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:39,292
You ought to write a book
about what women want.

1095
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:42,965
Come on, it'll help your sea-legs.
I can still feel the motion of that boat.

1096
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,735
That's what you call it.

1097
01:11:52,316 --> 01:11:53,476
Patch.

1098
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,613
What? What?

1099
01:12:04,228 --> 01:12:06,526
Well, if it isn't the Duchess herself?

1100
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,728
- Is that all you have to say to me?
- Oh, leave me alone.

1101
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:19,569
Scotch, straight.

1102
01:12:21,578 --> 01:12:23,705
Patch, what's the matter with you?

1103
01:12:24,515 --> 01:12:27,484
- Me? Nothing's the matter with me.
- Hello, Gallagher.

1104
01:12:29,186 --> 01:12:32,178
Well, well, if it isn't the other half
of the firm.

1105
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,715
Back from Havana so soon?

1106
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,090
Somebody close your show, too?

1107
01:12:37,161 --> 01:12:39,721
Are you trying to be funny, Patch?
Tod's not in the show business.

1108
01:12:39,797 --> 01:12:40,786
Another.

1109
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:44,632
- He's not in the show-business, huh?
- Come on away, Janie. He's just a little...

1110
01:12:44,702 --> 01:12:47,034
I'm a little drunk.
Is that what you're trying to say?

1111
01:12:47,104 --> 01:12:49,538
Well, drunk or sober,
my hat's still off to you.

1112
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:52,700
There are more ways than one to close a
show and you've taught me a new one.

1113
01:12:52,776 --> 01:12:54,641
- That's enough, Gallagher.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1114
01:12:54,712 --> 01:12:57,476
What's the matter? Afraid your boyfriend
will get a poke in the jaw...

1115
01:12:57,548 --> 01:12:59,038
for throwing a hundred people
out of work...

1116
01:12:59,116 --> 01:13:01,016
just so he could take you
on a joyride to Cuba?

1117
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,986
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No? Not much.

1118
01:13:04,054 --> 01:13:06,113
You got paid for rehearsing.
Nobody else did.

1119
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:08,522
- You didn't think Bradley gave you that?
- Shut up, Gallagher.

1120
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,787
- Say, what is this?
- Oh, you don't savvy?

1121
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:13,625
- No.
- Well, maybe I ought to speak Cuban.

1122
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,929
But it's the same in any language.

1123
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,797
I suppose you don't know
that your boyfriend here...

1124
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:19,165
paid Bradley to close the show.

1125
01:13:19,236 --> 01:13:22,137
You can settle that with me, Gallagher.
Janie had nothing to do with it.

1126
01:13:22,206 --> 01:13:24,834
- Tod, did you?
- Oh, yes, Tod did.

1127
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:27,001
And I'd like to take Tod over
to the theater right now...

1128
01:13:27,077 --> 01:13:29,102
and feed him to the boys and girls
for breakfast.

1129
01:13:29,179 --> 01:13:30,908
- They need something to eat.
- Mr. Gallagher.

1130
01:13:30,981 --> 01:13:33,882
Well, the show opens tomorrow night
and on my dough.

1131
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,782
Mr. Gallagher, quiet, please!

1132
01:13:36,653 --> 01:13:38,348
All right, Joe. All right.

1133
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,921
I'm not gonna tear up your joint.

1134
01:13:42,693 --> 01:13:44,490
But you better be careful
who you let in here.

1135
01:13:44,561 --> 01:13:46,529
The place will be getting a bad name.

1136
01:13:46,764 --> 01:13:49,255
- Oh, Janie.
- Tod, did you do that?

1137
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:53,527
Sure. It was the only way I could get you.

1138
01:13:54,338 --> 01:13:57,239
- You don't know what you've done.
- I loved a girl.

1139
01:13:57,574 --> 01:14:01,135
I wanted to marry her.
All I did was make sure I could marry her.

1140
01:14:01,412 --> 01:14:04,074
Yes, and incidentally threw a hundred
other people out of work.

1141
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,343
I didn't see it that way. I'm sorry.

1142
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,944
It's a little late for that now, I'm afraid.

1143
01:14:09,019 --> 01:14:11,419
- Janie, l...
- I'll see you later, Tod.

1144
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:22,660
Wait a minute. The boss is all steamed up,
and this ain't no Turkish bath.

1145
01:14:22,733 --> 01:14:24,496
- Get out of my way.
- No, wait a second.

1146
01:14:24,568 --> 01:14:26,229
No auditions today.
You're in a new show now.

1147
01:14:26,303 --> 01:14:28,794
Listen, bruiser, I'm mad
and I'm not fighting according to rules.

1148
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:31,534
The boss is in enough trouble without you.
You see?

1149
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:32,973
What is all this?

1150
01:14:36,213 --> 01:14:39,705
- Patch, I want to talk to you.
- What?

1151
01:14:41,652 --> 01:14:45,315
- You've got the wrong address, sister.
- You gotta listen to me.

1152
01:14:45,656 --> 01:14:48,523
I didn't know anything about that,
honest I didn't.

1153
01:14:48,592 --> 01:14:49,923
Don't give me that.

1154
01:14:49,993 --> 01:14:52,018
Do you think I'd do that to you
and the rest of them?

1155
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:54,030
Would I do it to myself?

1156
01:14:54,231 --> 01:14:55,357
Patch, listen!

1157
01:14:55,432 --> 01:14:59,095
If you don't believe me about the others,
you've got to believe me about myself.

1158
01:14:59,169 --> 01:15:01,160
I wouldn't sell out my one chance.

1159
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:05,538
Oh, it's not only you, it's everything.
Even the creditors are wise.

1160
01:15:06,009 --> 01:15:08,273
Hanging around
like a pack of hungry wolves.

1161
01:15:08,345 --> 01:15:10,313
But don't you see,
if you could show them a hit...

1162
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,938
You can't kid them.

1163
01:15:12,015 --> 01:15:15,212
I'll be lucky if they let the curtain go up.
They know a hit from a bust.

1164
01:15:15,285 --> 01:15:18,345
Oh, Patch, if it's going to be a bust,
let me be there when it happens.

1165
01:15:18,422 --> 01:15:20,322
It's too late. We open tomorrow night.

1166
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,915
But I know the routines.
Please let me go back in.

1167
01:15:22,993 --> 01:15:25,484
Forget about it, Duchess. It can't be done.

1168
01:15:25,963 --> 01:15:27,590
Life's too short.

1169
01:15:31,034 --> 01:15:33,696
So the great Patch Gallagher's
laying down.

1170
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,362
So, life's too short?

1171
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:37,937
So the first opus he's got his own dough in
is a flop!

1172
01:15:38,008 --> 01:15:41,205
Well, the wisies on Broadway will say
it wasn't Gallagher, it was Bradley!

1173
01:15:41,278 --> 01:15:42,836
- What?
- Without Bradley, Gallagher's a washout!

1174
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,847
- What was that Bradley crack?
- That's what they'll say.

1175
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:47,509
They'll put you on the pan and
keep you there till Bradley takes you off!

1176
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:48,608
I've got a notion to...

1177
01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:51,518
If that's what it takes
to get you on your feet, go ahead!

1178
01:15:55,659 --> 01:15:58,457
- What are you looking for, boss?
- I'm looking for that opening number.

1179
01:15:58,529 --> 01:16:00,463
- Here it is.
- Well, all right, put it on!

1180
01:16:00,531 --> 01:16:03,227
- How about that Warner dame?
- Put her back where she belongs.

1181
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,461
Say, that place has been closed for years.

1182
01:16:05,903 --> 01:16:07,370
- Say you know those routines?
- Sure I do.

1183
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:08,995
All right, get out of that back drop
and let's see them.

1184
01:16:09,072 --> 01:16:10,096
- Right.
- Right.

1185
01:16:10,174 --> 01:16:11,698
- Let's go!
- Right away.

1186
01:16:25,155 --> 01:16:29,319
<i>Heigh ho, the gang's all here
So let's have pretzels and let's have beer</i>

1187
01:16:29,393 --> 01:16:33,625
<i>Heigh ho, it's time to start
And put some spirit in the party</i>

1188
01:16:33,697 --> 01:16:37,827
<i>Oh, boy, the world's all right
We won't be singing the blues tonight</i>

1189
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:42,031
<i>Let's give the grand old cheer
It's all so merry when the gang's all here!</i>

1190
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:46,267
<i>Hail, all hail, put your worries up for sale</i>

1191
01:16:46,443 --> 01:16:50,470
<i>Hail, all hail, let the good old days prevail</i>

1192
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:54,583
<i>Heigh ho, the gang's all here
We all have pretzels, we all have beer</i>

1193
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,786
<i>Sing loud, the coast is clear</i>

1194
01:16:56,853 --> 01:16:58,912
<i>So let's make merry
while the gang's all here</i>

1195
01:16:58,989 --> 01:16:59,978
<i>Heigh ho</i>

1196
01:17:00,057 --> 01:17:01,115
<i>The gang's all here</i>

1197
01:17:01,191 --> 01:17:02,215
<i>So let's have pretzels</i>

1198
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:03,350
<i>Let's have beer</i>

1199
01:17:03,427 --> 01:17:04,416
<i>Heigh ho</i>

1200
01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:05,518
<i>It's time to start</i>

1201
01:17:05,596 --> 01:17:06,620
<i>And put some spirit</i>

1202
01:17:06,697 --> 01:17:07,686
<i>In the party!</i>

1203
01:17:07,798 --> 01:17:08,822
<i>Oh, boy</i>

1204
01:17:08,899 --> 01:17:09,888
<i>The world's all right</i>

1205
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:10,991
<i>We won't be singing</i>

1206
01:17:11,068 --> 01:17:12,057
<i>The blues tonight</i>

1207
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,193
<i>Let's give</i>

1208
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:14,259
<i>The grand old cheer</i>

1209
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:15,429
<i>It's all so merry</i>

1210
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:16,494
<i>When the gang's all here!</i>

1211
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,625
<i>Stand up and sing</i>

1212
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:41,187
<i>We've got the gang together</i>

1213
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:43,299
<i>We always sang together</i>

1214
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:45,196
<i>Stand up and sing</i>

1215
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:47,198
<i>Get in the swing</i>

1216
01:17:47,604 --> 01:17:49,367
<i>We've got no time for waiting</i>

1217
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,464
<i>It's time for celebrating</i>

1218
01:17:51,775 --> 01:17:53,367
<i>Get in the swing</i>

1219
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:57,910
<i>Heigh ho, the gang's all here
So let's have pretzels and let's have beer</i>

1220
01:17:58,081 --> 01:18:01,983
<i>Heigh ho, it's time to start
And put some spirit in the party!</i>

1221
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:06,187
<i>Oh, boy, the world's all right
We won't be singing the blues tonight</i>

1222
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:10,358
<i>Let's give the grand old cheer
It's all so merry when the gang's all here!</i>

1223
01:18:10,427 --> 01:18:14,363
<i>Hail, all hail, put your worries up for sale</i>

1224
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:18,431
<i>Hail, all hail, let the good old days prevail</i>

1225
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:22,762
<i>Heigh ho, the gang's all here
We all have pretzels, we all have beer</i>

1226
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:24,635
<i>Sing loud, the coast is clear</i>

1227
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:27,074
<i>So let's make merry
while the gang's all here!</i>

1228
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:16,312
<i>So in Bavaria
get yourself a sweet fräulein</i>

1229
01:20:16,453 --> 01:20:19,547
<i>She can help you drink a stein
of good old beer</i>

1230
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:23,651
<i>So in Bavaria
clink your glasses all around</i>

1231
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,321
<i>Make that tinkle, tinkle sound
Spread good cheer!</i>

1232
01:20:27,898 --> 01:20:31,026
<i>In Bavaria, we take good care of you</i>

1233
01:20:31,268 --> 01:20:34,726
<i>In all this area skies are clear</i>

1234
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:38,405
<i>So in Bavaria
Isn't this a happy scene</i>

1235
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:41,933
<i>Ach, du lieber Augustin, drink your beer!</i>

1236
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:45,773
<i>Let's go Bavarian
Get yourself a sweet fräulein</i>

1237
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:49,045
<i>She can help you drink a stein
of good old beer</i>

1238
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:52,945
<i>Let's go Bavarian
Clink your glasses all around</i>

1239
01:20:53,156 --> 01:20:54,885
<i>Make that tinkle, tinkle sound</i>

1240
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:56,289
<i>Spread good cheer</i>

1241
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:00,161
<i>Here in Bavaria
they take good care of you</i>

1242
01:21:00,597 --> 01:21:04,055
<i>In all this area skies are clear, so</i>

1243
01:21:04,134 --> 01:21:07,433
<i>Let's go Bavarian
Isn't this a happy scene?</i>

1244
01:21:07,504 --> 01:21:10,701
<i>Ach, du lieber Augustin, drink your beer!</i>

1245
01:21:18,548 --> 01:21:21,847
<i>This is just an idle burg
More famous far than Heidelberg</i>

1246
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,647
<i>And what's it famous for?</i>

1247
01:21:24,054 --> 01:21:25,646
<i>Beer! Beer! Beer!</i>

1248
01:21:25,822 --> 01:21:29,349
<i>No one cares for Piper-Heidsieck
Everybody laughs their sides sick</i>

1249
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,121
<i>While they yell for more</i>

1250
01:21:31,194 --> 01:21:32,821
<i>Beer! Beer! Beer!</i>

1251
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:36,123
<i>Here's a place where skies are never gray</i>

1252
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,160
<i>Here's a place to drink your cares away</i>

1253
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:43,664
<i>Let's go Bavarian
Get yourself a sweet fräulein</i>

1254
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,766
<i>She can help you drink a stein
of good old beer!</i>

1255
01:22:14,271 --> 01:22:15,966
- How am I doing?
- So far, so good.

1256
01:22:16,039 --> 01:22:17,870
- Say, boss...
- Go change for your next number.

1257
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:19,431
- Yes, sir.
- The customers seem to like it.

1258
01:22:19,509 --> 01:22:22,478
- Yeah? Well, we're not through yet.
- Come on, girls, everybody. Come on!

1259
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:33,877
<i>You're old-fashioned, you're passé</i>

1260
01:23:33,984 --> 01:23:36,009
<i>Rhythm 's in the air today</i>

1261
01:23:36,152 --> 01:23:40,521
<i>Come with me, leave the past
Life today is wild and fast</i>

1262
01:23:40,624 --> 01:23:44,856
<i>On your toes, everybody rise</i>

1263
01:23:45,261 --> 01:23:49,459
<i>On your toes, open up your eyes</i>

1264
01:23:49,966 --> 01:23:53,163
<i>This is the time for plenty of action</i>

1265
01:23:53,336 --> 01:23:54,496
<i>Action!</i>

1266
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,198
<i>On your toes</i>

1267
01:23:56,272 --> 01:23:59,070
<i>Shout it to the skies!</i>

1268
01:23:59,309 --> 01:24:01,573
<i>Go, go, go, let her go faster</i>

1269
01:24:01,645 --> 01:24:03,909
<i>Faster, faster, follow master</i>

1270
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:08,542
<i>Go, go, go, that's the rhythm of the day</i>

1271
01:24:08,685 --> 01:24:13,247
<i>Run, run, run, rhythm is master
Motors turning, wires burning</i>

1272
01:24:13,356 --> 01:24:17,349
<i>Run, run, run, that's the rhythm of the day</i>

1273
01:24:18,061 --> 01:24:22,191
<i>Even love is electric
Even love has a beat</i>

1274
01:24:22,832 --> 01:24:24,857
<i>Here's the only correct trick</i>

1275
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:27,399
<i>Keep at fever heat</i>

1276
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:28,596
<i>Up, up, up</i>

1277
01:24:28,672 --> 01:24:32,073
<i>Hitting the skyline
Pulses beating, keep repeating</i>

1278
01:24:32,142 --> 01:24:36,374
<i>Go, go, go, that's the rhythm of the day</i>

1279
01:25:27,363 --> 01:25:29,194
<i>That's the rhythm of the day</i>

1280
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,582
Nice work, Gallagher, old boy. Great show.

1281
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:44,190
- Certainly enjoyed it, Patch.
- It's all right with me though.

1282
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:45,887
Think you've got a hit.

1283
01:29:00,476 --> 01:29:03,445
Well, you double-crossed me, Janie.
You're a success.

1284
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:07,982
You were marvelous.

1285
01:29:08,618 --> 01:29:11,109
Believe now that dancing
is my racket, Tod?

1286
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:14,652
Well, I'll give in if you will, Janie.
Marry me.

1287
01:29:15,425 --> 01:29:19,191
You can still go on with this.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.

1288
01:29:21,297 --> 01:29:24,630
<i>Tod, I love to say "can it" and I...</i>

1289
01:29:24,934 --> 01:29:29,337
I love shoes with ribbons on them
and I got a perfect passion for zippers.

1290
01:29:29,672 --> 01:29:32,106
Well, you can put zippers on your sables,
if you like.

1291
01:29:32,175 --> 01:29:36,043
No. I'm afraid "them things"
won't mix with "those things."

1292
01:29:37,213 --> 01:29:39,579
- Steve. Steve!
- Yes, boss.

1293
01:29:40,817 --> 01:29:43,047
- I was just talking to one of the girls.
- Yeah.

1294
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:44,347
Steve...

1295
01:29:45,555 --> 01:29:48,820
<i>tell Joe to dim down
on that Dancing Lady number.</i>

1296
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:50,558
<i>Dim down on Dancing Lady.</i>

1297
01:29:50,626 --> 01:29:52,856
Yeah, but to follow Miss Barlow
with an amber spot.

1298
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:54,487
- An amber spot.
- Yeah.

1299
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:59,500
Yeah, an amber spot.
And tomorrow night I'll try a rose spot.

1300
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:04,297
I get it. Miss Barlow.
Top spot, amber spot, rose spot.

1301
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:08,837
Come in, come in.

1302
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:12,513
- Oh, you're busy. Excuse me.
- No, that's all right. Come in.

1303
01:30:12,582 --> 01:30:13,947
Oh, and Steve...

1304
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:17,747
during that dramatic bit tell them to
follow Miss Barlow with a blue spot.

1305
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:19,549
- A blue spot?
- Yeah.

1306
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:22,584
- Blue.
- Good night.

1307
01:30:23,526 --> 01:30:25,551
- Good night, boss.
- Good night, Duchess.

1308
01:30:25,628 --> 01:30:26,652
Night, Steve.

1309
01:30:26,729 --> 01:30:30,529
White spot, amber spot, blue spot.
Looks like you're in a spot.

1310
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:37,767
- Sure glad that first night's over.
- Yeah.

1311
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:43,805
I saw your face once in the wings.

1312
01:30:44,547 --> 01:30:47,448
Made me feel as if
everything I was doing was wrong.

1313
01:30:48,017 --> 01:30:50,144
I guess I got that kind of a face.

1314
01:30:56,392 --> 01:30:58,656
You better go home and get some rest.

1315
01:30:59,762 --> 01:31:02,560
And don't stay out too late
with your boyfriend.

1316
01:31:05,735 --> 01:31:07,066
He's gone.

1317
01:31:07,703 --> 01:31:09,500
Yeah. Until tomorrow night.

1318
01:31:12,975 --> 01:31:15,000
He's gone for good, Patch.

1319
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,779
Say, what is this you're dishing out?

1320
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:28,684
Can't you take it?

1321
01:31:40,803 --> 01:31:41,792
English
