1
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,242
Hey, how did you open your cell door?

2
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:24,864
Hey!

3
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,005
What are you doing?

4
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:27,747
Open Sector 2!

5
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,334
How did you get out?

6
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:34,533
Get back in your cell.

7
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:37,833
<i>I told you, get back in your cell!</i>

8
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:40,458
Let's give you a few friends to play with.

9
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:55,471
Sorry.

10
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:03,652
Send some guards in.

11
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:04,794
I'm trying.

12
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:13,250
Okay, I'm set.
How's things going down below?

13
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,209
How do you think? I'm in a sewer.

14
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:17,495
The doors won't open! We're locked in!

15
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,256
Sound the alarm!

16
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:28,885
We've lost control!

17
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:30,642
Captain!

18
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:47,817
I'm in position.

19
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:49,983
Move to phase 2.

20
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,789
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

21
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,340
What's wrong?
What's happening, Benji?

22
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,334
Oh, God.
He's not going to the extraction point.

23
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:51,384
Stay focused.
He knows where he's going.

24
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:01,897
No, I'm not. I won't.
I will not open that door.

25
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:05,191
Please go to the extraction point, Ethan.
I know.

26
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,065
I know what this means, but I can't.
I'm not authorised...

27
00:06:09,615 --> 00:06:11,239
Go to the extraction point, Ethan.

28
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:12,867
Go to the extraction point!

29
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:15,113
Oh, you're just going to wait.

30
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,280
We're going to wait. Great. I can wait.

31
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:29,423
Okay, fine. Fine! Fine!

32
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:30,928
There.

33
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,674
We'll just screw
the whole thing up on purpose.

34
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,266
Jane? We're going
to have a slight delay.

35
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:03,203
Why do you want to go in there?

36
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:10,800
Bogdan!

37
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:12,969
Bogdan!

38
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:15,680
Sergei?

39
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:17,140
Time to go!

40
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,683
Now?

41
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,101
Yes, now!

42
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:26,430
I don't know what he's doing,
and for some reason, I'm helping him.

43
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,735
As long as he's where he should be
when the song ends.

44
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,022
We have a passenger.

45
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:02,846
Sergei!

46
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:14,986
<i>Open all of them!</i>

47
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,549
Oh God!

48
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:38,094
Oh God oh God oh God...

49
00:08:38,512 --> 00:08:42,046
Sergei, please tell me there's more to this plan!

50
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,013
Let's go...

51
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:23,300
Agent Hunt?

52
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:24,473
And you are?

53
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:26,183
Agent Carter.

54
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,019
Okay.

55
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:30,896
Who's your pal?

56
00:09:31,022 --> 00:09:32,184
I'll tell you on the way!

57
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:37,980
Light the fuse.

58
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:38,812
Sergei, what's going on?

59
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:39,977
It's OK, Bogdan.

60
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,015
I don't mean to bring up
the elephant in the room,

61
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,727
but what's with the big, hairy Russian?

62
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:47,072
Who, Bogdan? He fed me intel. If I left
him there, they would've killed him.

63
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,709
So we're gonna give him his freedom.

64
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:49,919
Did you call in the sweepers?

65
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,024
On their way.

66
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,736
Good, good.

67
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:56,826
Benji, how is it you're here?

68
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,951
Oh, I passed the field exam.

69
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,085
Crazy, right?

70
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,123
Yeah. Crazy.

71
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:04,791
- DNA test.
- It's me.

72
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,790
It's procedure.
I'm just confirming it's you.

73
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,675
- You're very thorough.
- Sergei?

74
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,047
Are you not Russian?

75
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,764
Relax.

76
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:14,263
Sweepers approaching! Brooms are out!

77
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:15,850
- Roger that.
- Sergei.

78
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:19,301
Are you not Sergei?

79
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:25,484
You'll be fine.

80
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:26,814
Bogdan.

81
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,363
I always take care of my friends.

82
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,403
My friend.

83
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:38,157
Messy bringing him along.

84
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:39,831
I thought it went rather well.

85
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,158
Mind telling me what you were doing
in a Russian prison?

86
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,876
Mind telling me why you broke me out?

87
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:47,248
This wasn't a rescue mission?

88
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:48,876
Let me put it this way.

89
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:51,630
If the Secretary wanted me out of there,

90
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,719
it must be pretty bad out here.

91
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,559
We were after a file.

92
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:01,598
We lost it.

93
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:04,227
"We"? Who lost it? You?

94
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,894
Agent Hanaway.

95
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,645
Where's Hanaway?

96
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,080
<i>It was a letter drop.</i>

97
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,835
<i>Classified file.</i>

98
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:29,502
<i>It should have been a simple intercept.</i>

99
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,799
<i>We knew which train</i>
<i>the courier was on.</i>

100
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,725
ETA, two minutes on the courier.

101
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,530
<i>But there was one thing we didn't know.</i>

102
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,553
Bobcat, your train's six minutes out.

103
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,810
<i>Who the courier was.</i>

104
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,240
It's now or never, Bobcat.

105
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:06,498
The courier delivering the file,
what's his name?

106
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,121
<i>Go ahead. Shoot.</i>

107
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,122
We are out of time.

108
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:19,303
I need a name, folks.
I can't track all these people at once.

109
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:23,974
<i>Marek. Stefanski. For the love of God!</i>

110
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:25,187
You got it?

111
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,227
Marek Stefanski.

112
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:30,901
Searching.

113
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:46,080
I'll take it from here.

114
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,758
Hey, you all right, buddy?

115
00:14:57,885 --> 00:14:59,961
<i>Hanaway dropped the mark</i>
<i>and grabbed his bag.</i>

116
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:02,551
Sit down. Catch your breath.

117
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:07,474
<i>He had the file in his hands.</i>
<i>Easy in, easy out.</i>

118
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:08,688
File secured.

119
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:13,185
<i>But we weren't the only ones after it.</i>

120
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:16,188
Bobcat, someone else
has crashed this party.

121
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:19,353
I'm not alone.

122
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:21,492
<i>Local police?</i>

123
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:23,776
No. Armed hostiles.

124
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,962
Hang tight, I'm coming!
Outrigger, back him up.

125
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,875
<i>Negative, Outrigger.</i>

126
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:38,379
<i>Rendezvous southwest corner,</i>
<i>60 seconds.</i>

127
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:43,505
<i>Hanaway's lens cam drew a facial</i>
<i>match and triggered a warning.</i>

128
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:48,011
<i>But it was too late.</i>

129
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:56,306
No!

130
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,573
You're going to be okay.

131
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:07,786
You're so beautiful.

132
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:12,956
I'm sorry, I... I should have told you.

133
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:19,256
<i>It was my op.</i>

134
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,800
<i>I put him in the field.</i>

135
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:26,673
<i>And she left him</i>
<i>just alive enough for me to see him die.</i>

136
00:16:44,324 --> 00:16:45,439
I'm sorry.

137
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:49,912
You know her?

138
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,951
That's Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

139
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,624
Works for diamonds.

140
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,117
What was in the file?

141
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,297
Russian nuclear launch codes.

142
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:19,972
IMF's been looking for an emerging
extremist, code name, Cobalt.

143
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,193
He's determined to detonate
a nuclear weapon however he can.

144
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,443
We know Moreau's
worked for him before.

145
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:27,695
What else does IMF know about him?

146
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,190
As much as you do now.

147
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,327
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

148
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:35,028
you can bet Cobalt's gone
from a person of interest

149
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:36,541
to enemy number one.

150
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:38,544
We're here.

151
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,395
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

152
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:05,520
Why was he in prison?

153
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:10,361
He disappeared after he and his wife...
You know.

154
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:14,529
I thought he'd just been transferred.
Put on leave.

155
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,624
There were rumours, though.
Talk of an unsanctioned hit.

156
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:21,293
<i>Welcome back, Mr Hunt.</i>

157
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,669
<i>In your absence,</i>
<i>IMF has learned that Cobalt is or was</i>

158
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:27,467
<i>a level-1 nuclear strategist</i>
<i>for Russian intelligence.</i>

159
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:30,676
<i>Therefore, the only way to uncover</i>
<i>his actual identity</i>

160
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:33,045
<i>is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.</i>

161
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,694
<i>In order to get past their checkpoints,</i>

162
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,512
<i>you'll be impersonating</i>
<i>General Anatoly Fedorov.</i>

163
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:40,554
<i>We believe Cobalt</i>
<i>will do everything he can</i>

164
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,645
<i>to destroy any record of his identity.</i>

165
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:44,813
<i>Your mission,</i>
<i>should you choose to accept it,</i>

166
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:48,027
<i>is to penetrate the highly-secured</i>
<i>archive inside the Kremlin</i>

167
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:50,876
<i>and retrieve Cobalt's file</i>
<i>before he can destroy it.</i>

168
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,780
<i>New intel suggests Cobalt</i>
<i>is already en route, leaving you...</i>

169
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:57,449
<i>...4 hours 52 minutes...</i>

170
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,825
<i>...to infiltrate.</i>

171
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:01,577
<i>To save time,</i>
<i>we've chosen your team for you.</i>

172
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,037
<i>Agents Carter and Dunn.</i>

173
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:09,965
<i>As always, should you or any member</i>
<i>of your team be caught or killed,</i>

174
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:13,046
<i>the Secretary will disavow</i>
<i>any knowledge of your actions.</i>

175
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:15,634
<i>This message</i>
<i>will self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

176
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:16,962
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>

177
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,111
What do you got?

178
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,794
We're going into the Kremlin.

179
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,799
I thought you said "The Kremlin."

180
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:56,712
I thought you said "The Kremlin."

181
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:00,427
Okay.

182
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:39,844
This is very exciting.

183
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,849
Being out in the field.

184
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,684
With you, you know.

185
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,349
It's a bit of a dream for me.

186
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:52,981
Love your disguise, by the way.
You look just like him.

187
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:57,353
It's a shame we're not wearing masks.
You know, like, full masks.

188
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,863
Everybody gets to
wear a mask but Benji.

189
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:02,990
Sorry.

190
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,787
I'm tense. I babble when I'm nervous.

191
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:06,871
I'm doing it again. Shut up, Benji.

192
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,471
Okay, seven security guards.

193
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:25,135
X-ray machines. Cameras.
Metal detectors.

194
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:27,389
Just what we expected. We can do this.

195
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,726
Releasing in three, two, one.

196
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,571
Game face, game face.
Kremlin game face.

197
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,749
General...

198
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:52,908
I am Major Egorov.

199
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,910
Your documents.

200
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:03,503
You should know your boss.

201
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:04,650
You should know your boss.

202
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:31,331
I can't find you.

203
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:38,583
Run it again...

204
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:39,793
...Private.

205
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,418
Egorov.

206
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:54,436
Excuse me, General. I didn't recognise you.

207
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:58,312
You're going to regret this, Egorov.

208
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,158
I think that went quite well.

209
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,412
Just shut it.

210
00:23:10,537 --> 00:23:11,580
Sorry.

211
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:36,997
It's going to work.

212
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,908
I'm sorry, by the way.
About you and Julia.

213
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:45,253
You know, not working out.

214
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:49,000
I wanted to say something
before you went away, but...

215
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,414
I liked her, you know.

216
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,261
He's off the phone now.

217
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:31,841
It's empty.

218
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:34,397
The nest is empty.

219
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:50,616
Check in, Team Leader.

220
00:28:50,873 --> 00:28:51,915
<i>Over.</i>

221
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,164
<i>Repeat. Check in, Team Leader.</i>

222
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,668
Have you made it to the Archive Room?

223
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:58,628
Captain! The Archive Room!

224
00:28:58,881 --> 00:28:59,923
Run!

225
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:03,885
Someone is piggybacking our frequency.

226
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:05,756
<i>Team Leader,</i>

229
00:29:14,562 --> 00:29:16,187
Rendezvous nine-two.

230
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,848
Shut the gate!

231
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,814
Quickly!

232
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:34,342
Our media is no more
truthful than yours,

233
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:36,379
American.

234
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:40,713
But we both know
that the real cause of the explosion

235
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,379
was you.

236
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:49,848
<i>Awaiting your go-sign, Team Leader.</i>

237

<i>Standing by to detonate.</i>

238
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:54,403
The worst part for you,

239
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:56,483
"Team Leader,"

240
00:32:57,365 --> 00:33:00,568
is I am the man assigned
to make you suffer for it.

241
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,242
For what you did to my country.

242
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,123
This is a hospital...

243
00:33:08,627 --> 00:33:09,669
Not a night club.

244
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:11,617
Misha... help me here...

245
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:14,007
Room twelve.

246
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:31,895
The doctors say he's lucky to be alive.

247
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,395
Only a mild concussion.

248
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,487
I don't give a damn about his health.

249
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,195
I have questions that need answering.

250
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:48,654
Be careful!

251
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:51,948
Prepare a transport.

252
00:33:57,591 --> 00:33:58,634
Check over there!

253
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:41,549
Not a good idea.

254
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:45,839
It seemed like one a minute ago.

255
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:42,729
All agents! Hot target heading west!

256
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,210

SAT 20. Agent 82-Delta-Echo
requesting immediate evac.

259
00:36:08,762 --> 00:36:11,004
Rendezvous Alpha 113.

260
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,927
<i>Confirmed. Alpha 113.</i>

261
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:40,203
<i>Details surrounding</i>
<i>the intricate system of gas lines</i>

262
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:43,005
<i>that run beneath the square</i>
<i>are still forthcoming,</i>

263
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,047
<i>but the majority of</i>
<i>those lines date back to the Soviet era</i>

265

Anna... Anna... I've been thinking...

266
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,933
It looks like we...

267
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:02,555
We should leave town
for a couple of days.

268
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,311
Alex, you, me. Vacations.

269
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:07,647

- Tonight.

Just the three of us.

00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:17,610
<i>...may not have been an accident,</i>
<i>but a targeted attack.</i>

<i>Preliminary numbers are just starting...</i>

275

Where will we go?

276
00:37:21,902 --> 00:37:24,082
<i>...to come in regarding</i>
<i>those wounded in the blast.</i>

277
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:26,453
<i>We can confirm that 11 tourists...</i>

278
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:27,626

279
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:29,415
<i>...their nationalities still unconfirmed,</i>

<i>to area hospitals for treatment.</i>

281
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:36,345
<i>While Russian officials continue</i>
<i>to blame a gas-main break,</i>

282
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:40,768
<i>experts are citing the shape of the blast</i>
<i>area and the size of the debris field</i>

283
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:43,646
<i>as more consistent</i>
<i>with that of a set explosive,</i>

284
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:46,014
<i>leading to speculation</i>
<i>that this may have been</i>

285
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,064
<i>an undeclared act of aggression.</i>

286
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:50,317
<i>Although the Defence Ministry</i>
<i>is maintaining</i>

287
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:52,000
<i>that this is strictly an accident...</i>

288
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,533
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

289
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:57,197
We're leaving now.

290
00:37:58,663 --> 00:37:59,860
Anya!

291
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:02,911
Anya!

292
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:16,713
We have work to do.

293
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:47,669
Mr Secretary.

294
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,414
I wasn't aware you were in Russia.

295
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:57,001
I'm not.
Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.

296
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:04,179
Yesterday I flew in
to accept the order of Friendship

297
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:05,769
from the Russian Prime Minister.

298
00:39:06,062 --> 00:39:08,517
Now I'm headed back to Washington

299
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,269
to hand the President my resignation.

300
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,692
My Chief Analyst, William Brandt.

301
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:19,522
Do you have a pen?

302
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:20,701
- Pardon me?
- A pen.

303
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:23,282
Yeah.

304
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,122
Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?

305
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,543
Chief Analyst, you say?

306
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:31,451
If you're implying that
I made a bad call...

307
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:32,701
European male.

308
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:36,041
Fifties. About six-foot,
180 pounds. Blue eyes.

309
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:37,455
Who is he?

310
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:42,180
A crude drawing,
but by your description,

311
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:43,634
that could be Kurt Hendricks.

312
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:47,300
190 IQ. Served in
Swedish Special Forces.

313
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:50,307
Professor of physics,
Stockholm University.

314
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:52,099
Specialist in nuclear endgame theory.

315
00:39:52,232 --> 00:39:53,857
Asked to resign...

316
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,152
Well, because he's crazy.

317
00:39:58,197 --> 00:39:59,239
Cobalt.

318
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,630
You have to alert the Kremlin
that one of their strategists

319
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,947
has a nuclear launch device

320
00:40:06,372 --> 00:40:09,159
and one of his operatives
has the codes to activate it.

321
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:10,489
And what makes you say that?

322
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:12,836
I saw him

323
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,167
<i>leaving the executive armoury,</i>
<i>bag in hand.</i>

324
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:18,539
He set off that explosion
to cover his tracks.

325
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:20,896
It could be weeks
before the Russians know it's missing.

326
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,996
Unless we tell them.

327
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,595
They won't listen to us.

328
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,636
As far as the Russians are concerned,
we just bombed the Kremlin.

329
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,681
The tension between
the United States and Russia

330
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:33,766
hasn't been this high
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

331
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:38,188
And the blame, right or wrong,
points to IMF.

332
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:46,609
The President has initiated
Ghost Protocol.

333
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,406
The entire IMF has been disavowed.

334
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:55,369
So what happens now?

335
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,789
Now, I've been ordered
to take you back to Washington,

336
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,924
where the DoD will label you
as a rogue extremist

337
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,631
and hang the Kremlin bombing
on you and your team.

338
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,008
Unless,

339
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,307
you were to escape

340
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,637
somewhere between here
and the airport,

341
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,353
having assaulted Mr Brandt and me.

342
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:17,525
Sir?

343
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,641
You would then

344
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,695
illegally scrounge
whatever material you could

345
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:24,353
from a backup supply cache
that I've overlooked.

346
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:27,775
The same cache where
your team are waiting for further orders.

347
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:28,947
Sir, you may want to...

348
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:33,744
You will then disappear, and this
conversation never having taken place,

349
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,495
your intentions would be unclear.

350
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:40,327
But if any one of your team
is caught or killed,

351
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,587
they will be branded terrorists,

352
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:46,167
out to incite global nuclear war.

353
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:54,394
Your mission,

354
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,722
should you choose to accept it.

355
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:04,567
Ethan, you were my best man.

356
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:07,608
And I'm sorry it's come to this,

357
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:10,197
after all the sacrifices you made.

358
00:42:12,537 --> 00:42:14,660
If we don't meet again,
I just want you to know,

359
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,459
I've always considered you a friend.

360
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,543
Stay down! Drive, drive, drive!

361
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:49,318
You okay?

362
00:42:49,422 --> 00:42:50,460
Yeah.

363
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,619
Take a deep breath. Stay with me.

364
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:54,989
- Ready?
- Yeah.

365
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:20,848
What do we do?

366
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,482
Wait here.

367
00:43:25,776 --> 00:43:27,568
Where else am I going to go?

368
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:44,459
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

369
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:00,722
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

370
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:02,717
Hold your fire!

371
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:04,845
Hold your fire!

372
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:06,269
Weapons down!

373
00:44:07,984 --> 00:44:09,812
What are you firing at?

374
00:44:31,132 --> 00:44:34,252
Two prisoners escaped from Rankow Prison today.

375
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:43,269
And this one?

376
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,847
What do we know about him?

377
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,061
Why would that work?

378
00:44:52,736 --> 00:44:53,851
Why would what work?

379
00:44:53,988 --> 00:44:56,111
The flare on the body,
why would that work?

380
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,354
It did work.

381
00:44:57,491 --> 00:44:59,282
- Yeah, I know, but...
- Hey!

382
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,573
But why? I mean, how did you know
that would draw their fire?

383
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:05,829
I didn't. I played a hunch.

384
00:45:07,584 --> 00:45:10,870
Okay. All right,
so what was your scenario?

385
00:45:11,005 --> 00:45:13,709
Right, you...
There's a guy being shot at in the water.

386
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:16,925
All of a sudden, decides to light up
a flare and swim around?

387
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:20,668
I mean, what did you assume
they'd be thinking?

388
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:22,466
- Thinking?
- Yeah.

389
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,387
I didn't assume they were thinking.

390
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:27,615
I assumed they were shooting
at anything that moved.

391
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:29,971
I just gave them a target. Look, these...

392
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,812
These guys aren't
Rhodes Scholars, you know?

393
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:38,567
It's really happening, isn't it?

394
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,492
Yeah.

395
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:43,037
Okay, you know what that sound is?

396
00:45:43,162 --> 00:45:44,905
That's our ride out of here!

397
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,242
All right, it's a green car. Number 47.

398
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:52,997
I see green!

399
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:54,623
Okay, let's do it.

400
00:45:54,756 --> 00:45:56,250
Go, go, go, go.

401
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:59,960
All right, 47.

402
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:01,292
I don't see it.

403
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,840
47.

404
00:46:02,972 --> 00:46:04,253
Oh, shit!

405
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,806
This is it. The manifest.

406
00:46:12,941 --> 00:46:14,483
<i>Enter your code.</i>

407
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:15,652
Pole!

408
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:19,728
Jeez...

409
00:46:21,324 --> 00:46:22,783
<i>Press enter.</i>

410
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:26,489
Retinal scanner!

411
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:32,283
<i>Retinal scan required.</i>

412
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:33,699
Watch out!

413
00:46:34,587 --> 00:46:36,544
<i>Retinal scan required.</i>

414
00:46:36,673 --> 00:46:38,215
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

415
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:54,559
Ethan? Jeez, I thought you were dead!

416
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:56,398
- We are.
- Who's this?

417
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:59,810
Agents Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, Chief Analyst.

418
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:01,225
Analyst?

419
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:08,657
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

420
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:19,078
<i>How will the world finally end?</i>

421
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:22,085
<i>It is my job to predict the unthinkable.</i>

422
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:26,210
<i>To treat the death of billions as a game.</i>

423
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:31,175
<i>After 20 years of this, I was numb.</i>

424
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,014
<i>Until a new question crossed my mind.</i>

425
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:38,810
<i>What happens after</i>
<i>the end of the world?</i>

426
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,107
Are you sure your line is secure?

427
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,944
<i>Every two or three million years...</i>

428
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:46,108
Are you certain your line is secure?

429
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:50,286
<i>...some natural catastrophe</i>
<i>devastates all life on Earth.</i>

430
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:52,037
<i>But life goes on.</i>

431
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:55,949
<i>And what little remains</i>
<i>is made stronger.</i>

432
00:47:56,084 --> 00:48:00,034
<i>Put simply,</i>
<i>world destruction is an unpleasant,</i>

433
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:02,544
<i>but necessary part of evolution.</i>

434
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:07,257
<i>What happens then, I wondered,</i>

435
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:09,962
<i>when mankind faces</i>
<i>the next end of the world?</i>

436
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:13,051
I don't care what you have to do
to get him to Dubai.

437
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:15,639
I'll make it worth his while. Just do it.

438
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,225
<i>I looked to Hiroshima, Nagasaki...</i>

439
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:19,555
I'll be waiting for your call.

440
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:22,062
<i>...thriving cities rebuilt from the ashes,</i>

441
00:48:22,193 --> 00:48:24,518
<i>monuments to the unimaginable,</i>

442
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:26,480
<i>dedicated to the concept of peace.</i>

443
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:31,694
<i>It occurred to me here</i>
<i>that nuclear war might have a place</i>

444
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:33,238
<i>in the natural order.</i>

445
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:35,410
<i>But only if it could be controlled.</i>

446
00:48:35,873 --> 00:48:40,085
<i>Only if it touched</i>
<i>every living soul equally.</i>

447
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:44,630
IMF now believes this man,
Kurt Hendricks,

448
00:48:44,757 --> 00:48:47,674
is the nuclear extremist,
code name Cobalt.

449
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:49,675
Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin,

450
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:52,425
with what is likely
a nuclear launch device.

451
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,887
Two days ago, Sabine Moreau killed
one of our agents in Budapest

452
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,642
and relieved him
of Russian nuclear launch codes.

453
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:05,186
Intel indicates she will check into
the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

454
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:08,652
Marius Wistrom
is a known operative of Cobalt.

455
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:11,194
Wistrom is currently en route to Dubai.

456
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:14,989
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

457
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,907
He's sending Wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

458
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,374
The Secretary

459
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,164
is dead.

460
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,337
The President
has invoked Ghost Protocol.

461
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,637
We're shut down.

462
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:37,713
No satellite, safe house,
support, or extraction.

463
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:40,971
The four of us
and the contents of this car

464
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:43,725
are all that remain of the IMF.

465
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:48,151
And as of this moment, any action
is unsanctioned. So if you want out,

466
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:49,558
speak now.

467
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,369
Our mission is Hendricks.

468
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:09,685
We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

469
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:10,957
Nothing can be left to chance.

470
00:50:11,061 --> 00:50:13,008
Everyone connected with this man

471
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:16,339
is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

472
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:17,921
No one can know we're still on line.

473
00:50:18,025 --> 00:50:20,262
We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

474
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,934
So, what's the play?

475
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,634
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau
in 36 hours.

476
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,888
Now we cannot let
the launch codes leave the hotel,

477
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:29,853
but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

478
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,025
He'll only do that if he has the codes.

479
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,529
Or if he thinks he has them.

480
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,862
Our objective is to intercept the sale,

481
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,198
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

482
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,070
and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.

483
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,532
Well, that's simple enough.

484
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,822
We snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.

485
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:48,536
Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the
codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

486
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:52,040
And how do you propose
we just snatch the codes from Moreau?

487
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,217
We take her out.

488
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:58,049
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

489
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,343
Discreetly?

490
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,094
Yeah.

491
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,518
Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.
Sorry. Nothing left to chance.

492
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,054
He said... I'm spitballing.
It's not all gonna be gold.

493
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,775
- We don't touch Wistrom.
- All right.

494
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:10,985
Or Moreau.

495
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,315
She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

496
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,108
After we hit Hendricks.

497
00:51:24,205 --> 00:51:25,368
Only pack what we need.

498
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:27,989
Yeah, absolutely. Only pack what we...
You never know.

499
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:58,353
So even if we can double
Wistrom and Moreau,

500
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,233
how do we keep them in separate rooms

501
00:52:01,367 --> 00:52:03,989
while having them think that
they're in the same room?

502
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,077
We give the hotel a facelift.

503
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:09,042
Wistrom will think
he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

504
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,373
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

505
00:52:11,544 --> 00:52:13,003
Where I'll double Moreau.

506
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,881
Downstairs, Benji will double Wistrom.

507
00:52:15,089 --> 00:52:16,127
Masks!

508
00:52:16,231 --> 00:52:17,626
And meet with the real Moreau.

509
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,212
And...

510
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,084
What am I doing?

511
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,343
You? You're the helper!

512
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:28,644
Helper. That's great.

513
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:33,177
Okay, so to the extent I understand
what you're talking about here...

514
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,850
The Burj Khalifa,
it's the tallest building in the world,

515
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:39,232
and you want to alter its infrastructure

516
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:42,114
with the hopes of convincing
two people that they've

517
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,526
had a meeting,
which actually really never happened.

518
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:47,329
Right?

519
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:57,047
Camels.

520
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:46,675
<i>ETA on dry cleaning.</i>

521
00:53:46,804 --> 00:53:48,263
On my way up.

522
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:53,642
Okay, 34 minutes to door knock.

523
00:53:57,523 --> 00:53:59,183
Wow...

524
00:54:00,526 --> 00:54:04,654
okay, this is a slight wrinkle,
but nothing to worry about.

525
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,066
We're just going to have to go into
the server room from the outside.

526
00:54:09,327 --> 00:54:10,369
What?

527
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:14,073
Well, the firewalls on this building's
server are military grade.

528
00:54:14,206 --> 00:54:15,998
I mean, this would be a cinch

529
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,762
if I could call Youssef
back at headquarters,

530
00:54:17,866 --> 00:54:19,743
but Youssef doesn't exist any more,
and neither do we.

531
00:54:19,848 --> 00:54:21,328
I could hack it,
but it would take too long.

532
00:54:21,432 --> 00:54:22,397
Then hardwire in.

533
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:24,102
And there's four layers
of next-gen security

534
00:54:24,206 --> 00:54:25,311
between us and the server room.

535
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:27,219
There's no way
we can get to it from inside.

536
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:30,483
If we can't get to the server,
we don't control the elevators,

537
00:54:30,587 --> 00:54:32,383
we don't control the security cameras.

538
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:34,556
This operation is over
before it even begins.

539
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:36,635
I'm telling you,
we can get to it from outside.

540
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:37,782
"We"?

541
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:40,186
I'm... I'm on the computer.

542
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,068
I'm just...

543
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:45,474
The helper.

544
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:50,063
What floor is it on?

545
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,694
130.

546
00:54:52,535 --> 00:54:54,160
130?

547
00:54:58,416 --> 00:54:59,720
- Vent ducts.
- Pressure sensitive.

548
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:00,783
Not enough time.

549
00:55:00,888 --> 00:55:02,243
- Elevator shaft.
- Infrared sensors.

550
00:55:02,347 --> 00:55:03,390
Not enough time.

551
00:55:06,883 --> 00:55:08,591
How am I supposed to do this?

552
00:55:14,766 --> 00:55:16,225
God damn it!

553
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:21,051
Oh, that's high.

554
00:55:26,653 --> 00:55:30,603
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off
motion that disengages the bond.

555
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,863
When the metre is blue,
that's full adhesion.

556
00:55:32,993 --> 00:55:35,116
Easy way to remember, blue is glue.

557
00:55:35,245 --> 00:55:36,656
- And when it's red?
- Dead.

558
00:55:36,788 --> 00:55:39,623
Here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

559
00:55:39,749 --> 00:55:42,536
Both going back here. One, two.

560
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:46,703
Okay, Ethan, the hotel server is
eleven storeys up and seven units over.

561
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,749
Okay? Comm check.

562
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:51,051
Yeah. Copy.

563
00:55:52,678 --> 00:55:53,793
So...

564
00:55:57,808 --> 00:56:00,299
It's 26 minutes to door knock.

565
00:56:02,354 --> 00:56:03,517
Yeah.

566
00:56:58,202 --> 00:57:00,324
<i>25 minutes to door knock.</i>

567
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:16,665
What the hell is that?

568
00:57:32,068 --> 00:57:34,357
<i>Yeah, what the hell is that?</i>

569
00:57:35,905 --> 00:57:37,530
It's a sandstorm.

570
00:57:39,742 --> 00:57:40,837
It's a long way off, Ethan.

571
00:57:40,941 --> 00:57:42,191
<i>Shouldn't be a problem.</i>

572
00:57:45,248 --> 00:57:47,739
<i>24 minutes to door knock.</i>

573
00:57:50,753 --> 00:57:51,833
Where's Ethan?

574
00:57:54,924 --> 00:57:56,205
You've got to be kidding me.

575
00:58:46,141 --> 00:58:49,261
<i>23 minutes to door knock.</i>

576
00:59:07,996 --> 00:59:09,277
<i>I'm at server level.</i>

577
00:59:32,103 --> 00:59:33,383
22 minutes to door knock.

578
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:37,144
The countdown is not helping.

579
00:59:39,193 --> 00:59:40,236
I'm just saying.

580
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:11,512
<i>I'm in.</i>

581
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:13,311
That's great, Ethan.
You're halfway home.

582
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,099
<i>Located server.</i>

583
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:30,736
Please tell me we're online.

584
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:32,067
All right, we're live.

585
01:00:32,412 --> 01:00:36,410
Okay, I now have control of
the elevators and the security cameras.

586
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:37,579
Time to redecorate.

587
01:00:37,683 --> 01:00:40,585
Okay, you drive.
And look out for Wistrom and Moreau.

588
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:57,593
Moreau is at the elevators
ahead of schedule.

589
01:00:58,688 --> 01:00:59,803
Go.

590
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,106
We can't open this door, can we?

591
01:01:07,238 --> 01:01:08,483
<i>The door? No.</i>

592
01:01:08,615 --> 01:01:10,406
Ethan, you gotta get down here now.

593
01:01:11,785 --> 01:01:13,243
<i>Ethan!</i>

594
01:01:13,787 --> 01:01:15,993
<i>Is there a problem? Ethan?</i>

595
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:24,334
We're not gonna make it.

596
01:01:24,438 --> 01:01:25,475
We have to make it.

597
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:27,675
Where's Ethan?

598
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:51,948
Your line's not long enough!

599
01:01:52,574 --> 01:01:53,773
No shit!

600
01:02:40,872 --> 01:02:42,449
That was not easy,

601
01:02:42,582 --> 01:02:44,206
but I did it.

602
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:47,826
What'd I miss?

603
01:02:55,178 --> 01:02:58,594
The lens might be a little uncomfortable.

604
01:02:58,723 --> 01:03:01,643
It captures images and transmits them
to the printer in the briefcase.

605
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:04,601
All right?

606
01:03:04,729 --> 01:03:07,185
I can't see out of one eye, but I'm fine.

607
01:03:07,315 --> 01:03:08,857
Blink twice to activate the shutter.

608
01:03:10,234 --> 01:03:11,777
Notice the numbers are in order?

609
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:16,366
A perfect copy.

610
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:20,368
But the numbers are scrambled.

611
01:03:21,996 --> 01:03:23,034
Masks?

612
01:03:23,138 --> 01:03:25,115
60 seconds.
You sure I shouldn't wear a mask?

613
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,372
You know,
'cause I'm not exactly omar Sharif.

614
01:03:27,502 --> 01:03:29,587
I'll play it French.
This is your tracking device.

615
01:03:29,754 --> 01:03:31,600
- This is what you're tracking.
- The paper clip?

616
01:03:31,704 --> 01:03:32,642
No, it's the paper.

617
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:35,437
It's in the briefcase. It's coated with
isotopes which give off a unique...

618
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:36,897
It just means
that you can track the documents

619
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:38,002
even if they switch briefcases.

620
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,055
Range?

621
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:40,421
Not that good. It's, like, half a mile.

622
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,568
Safest thing to do would be not let
Wistrom out of your sight.

623
01:03:42,672 --> 01:03:43,808
Is that Wistrom?

624
01:03:48,188 --> 01:03:49,226
Who's that with him?

625
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:52,119
I don't know. We don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.

626
01:03:52,223 --> 01:03:53,401
Who's that with him?

627
01:03:54,778 --> 01:03:57,399
That's Leonid Lisenker.
Polish-born cryptographer.

628
01:03:57,531 --> 01:03:59,992
He redesigned Russia's nuclear
security after the Cold War.

629
01:04:00,617 --> 01:04:02,526
He's here to authenticate
the launch codes.

630
01:04:02,661 --> 01:04:04,736
- Yes, he is. We are blown.
- No, we're not blown.

631
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,280
Well, we will be as soon as he sees
the counterfeit launch codes.

632
01:04:07,384 --> 01:04:08,427
We're not blown.

633
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,996
He's in the elevator.

634
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:11,248
Delay them.

635
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,671
Benji, how long would it take you
to reprogram the case?

636
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,679
A couple of seconds. What for, though?

637
01:04:24,808 --> 01:04:26,931
To make an exact copy
of the launch codes.

638
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,602
- What?
- You can't do that.

639
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:30,188
- Wistrom's on 22!
- Slow him down.

640
01:04:30,314 --> 01:04:31,356
I'll do what I can.

641
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:35,693
Wait, wait. Ethan, hang on now!

642
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:37,100
Hang on. Just a second.

643
01:04:37,237 --> 01:04:40,689
You're talking about handing over active
nuclear launch codes to Wistrom?

644
01:04:40,824 --> 01:04:41,862
Yes. Reprogram the case.

645
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:42,993
Listen... Stop!

646
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:44,296
Just listen to what you're saying.

647
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:45,985
You're fixating.
You're not thinking clearly.

648
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,031
It's not gonna happen. I won't let it!

649
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:50,410
33 and climbing!

650
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,704
Brandt, use your head now.

651
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:53,826
The mission is not the codes,
the mission is Hendricks.

652
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:56,120
Then just let it play out.
Give him bad codes. Neutralise him.

653
01:04:56,224 --> 01:04:57,225
You know that won't do it.

654
01:04:57,329 --> 01:04:59,747
Failure to a terrorist
is just a rehearsal for success.

655
01:04:59,884 --> 01:05:01,212
41!

656
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:03,731
We lose Hendricks today,
he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

657
01:05:03,836 --> 01:05:04,811
He finds another way.

658
01:05:04,915 --> 01:05:06,258
With no IMF to stop him.

659
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,590
No. It's now or never.
Now, Brandt, give me the case.

660
01:05:08,695 --> 01:05:10,807
Nothing can be left to chance.
You said that.

661
01:05:10,937 --> 01:05:11,974
You're the analyst.

662
01:05:12,078 --> 01:05:14,534
Now, tell me there's not another way
for Hendricks to get those codes.

663
01:05:14,638 --> 01:05:15,451
50!

664
01:05:15,556 --> 01:05:18,058
You tell me that this is his only avenue,
right here, right now, today.

665
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:20,316
You tell me that, I'll walk away.

666
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:29,661
- We go without.
- Without masks?

667
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:31,034
- Jane needs to go.
- Ethan!

668
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,203
We have no choice.

669
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:34,012
Ethan, you'd be walking in
on Moreau unarmed.

670
01:05:34,116 --> 01:05:35,159
Face-first. Literally.

671
01:05:35,294 --> 01:05:36,420
How do we know they've met?

672
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:38,547
- How do we know they haven't?
- Doesn't matter!

673
01:05:39,715 --> 01:05:40,996
Damn it.

674
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,581
We have no choice.

675
01:06:34,102 --> 01:06:35,382
Goggles.

676
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:39,315
What if they have met?

677
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,734
Come in.

678
01:07:18,646 --> 01:07:20,804
Which one of you is Wistrom?

679
01:07:21,732 --> 01:07:23,274
Which one of you is Wistrom?

680
01:07:26,153 --> 01:07:27,434
I am.

681
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:30,781
I admire your work.

682
01:07:46,257 --> 01:07:47,371
Sit.

683
01:07:56,813 --> 01:07:58,011
Where are my codes?

684
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:01,066
Where are my diamonds?

685
01:08:02,277 --> 01:08:03,475
Close by.

686
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:05,726
You have my payment?

687
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:07,690
When I see the codes.

688
01:08:08,867 --> 01:08:10,526
Not to worry. Come in!

689
01:08:11,368 --> 01:08:12,993
I thought we could have tea.

690
01:08:20,377 --> 01:08:22,666
No diamonds, no codes.

691
01:08:23,213 --> 01:08:25,502
No codes, no diamonds.

692
01:08:29,428 --> 01:08:30,471
Kill this one.

693
01:08:30,596 --> 01:08:32,505
We didn't come alone.

694
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,514
That hallway out there is a kill-box.

695
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:35,970
You know who we work for.

696
01:08:36,101 --> 01:08:38,592
We come back with the codes,
or we don't come back.

697
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:41,844
How good is your backup?

698
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:43,524
The best.

699
01:08:46,987 --> 01:08:49,229
<i>I've killed the best.</i>

700
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,865
Do you care for some sugar?

701
01:08:56,246 --> 01:08:57,871
<i>Enough. Let's get this done.</i>

702
01:08:58,248 --> 01:09:00,621
You want payment, I want guarantees.

703
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:02,596
When he's authenticated the codes,

704
01:09:02,701 --> 01:09:05,119
I'll make the call
and you get your diamonds.

705
01:09:05,255 --> 01:09:06,880
That or

706
01:09:07,466 --> 01:09:09,423
we all go home in buckets.

707
01:09:10,427 --> 01:09:12,883
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

708
01:09:16,682 --> 01:09:17,725
Get the papers.

709
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:33,729
Is there a problem?

710
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,731
It's locked.

711
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:43,573
Forgive me. There must be a key.

712
01:09:44,794 --> 01:09:46,418
One moment, huh?

713
01:10:44,227 --> 01:10:48,272
My mistake.
It is a combination, not a key.

714
01:10:48,857 --> 01:10:50,481
You tell me the numbers.

715
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:57,532
They're good.

716
01:10:57,741 --> 01:10:58,784
Zero.

717
01:11:00,452 --> 01:11:01,495
Zero.

718
01:11:03,371 --> 01:11:04,414
Zero.

719
01:11:21,556 --> 01:11:22,754
Come on, come on, come on.

720
01:12:06,267 --> 01:12:08,473
It was a pleasure doing business with...

721
01:12:08,602 --> 01:12:10,725
Wistrom has the launch codes.
He's on the move.

722
01:12:11,272 --> 01:12:14,723
Hey, I did as you asked. I did.
Now let my family go!

723
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:16,401
Release Leonid's family.

724
01:12:16,527 --> 01:12:17,772
Thank God.

725
01:12:17,903 --> 01:12:19,279
You can thank him in person.

726
01:12:35,129 --> 01:12:37,500
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

727
01:12:44,471 --> 01:12:45,513
Kill him!

728
01:12:54,147 --> 01:12:55,262
Moreau's on the move!

729
01:12:56,316 --> 01:12:57,596
I've got her.

730
01:12:58,902 --> 01:12:59,939
Jane?

731
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:01,081
<i>She's an asset!</i>

732
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:02,559
I need her

733
01:13:02,697 --> 01:13:03,740
alive!

734
01:13:05,116 --> 01:13:06,231
<i>Acknowledge!</i>

735
01:13:06,951 --> 01:13:07,994
Acknowledge!

736
01:13:19,339 --> 01:13:22,790
Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator.
I can't see Leonid, though.

737
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,803
Benji, slow him down.
Get me an elevator.

738
01:13:40,193 --> 01:13:41,391
Find Leonid.

739
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,209
Benji, I've got a lock on Wistrom.
But I can't tell.

740
01:13:57,334 --> 01:13:58,959
<i>Is he still in the elevator?</i>

741
01:14:00,421 --> 01:14:01,463
Benji?

742
01:14:05,426 --> 01:14:06,463
Ethan. Over?

743
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,594
Benji.

744
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:08,720
Benji, I lost...

745
01:14:08,825 --> 01:14:09,596
Ethan, can you hear me?

746
01:14:09,701 --> 01:14:10,404
Ethan, can you hear me?

747
01:14:10,509 --> 01:14:11,889
Ethan, can you hear me? Over.

748
01:14:13,142 --> 01:14:14,256
Jesus!

749
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:21,639
Sit down!

750
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,270
- Watch her.
- Why me?

751
01:14:25,404 --> 01:14:26,863
Because if I do, I'll kill her.

752
01:14:56,642 --> 01:14:58,931
Hold it, Team Leader.

753
01:14:59,937 --> 01:15:02,393
Did you really think
I wouldn't catch up with you?

754
01:15:02,523 --> 01:15:04,480
You and I are not enemies.
It was a set-up...

755
01:15:04,609 --> 01:15:07,360
We'll find out your lies soon enough.

756
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:08,983
Move it!

757
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:11,615
I'm sorry about this.

758
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,889
Leonid. Benji?

759
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:37,428
Go for Benji.

760
01:15:37,532 --> 01:15:39,466
I've got Leonid by the elevators.
He's been shot.

761
01:15:39,571 --> 01:15:40,613
What?

762
01:15:51,322 --> 01:15:53,991
Hey, hey. Stay with me. Stay with me.

763
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:14,761
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

764
01:16:21,059 --> 01:16:22,637
Jane! No!

765
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:25,608
Come on. Come on.

766
01:22:19,287 --> 01:22:20,799
Now, what happened
with Moreau, Jane?

767
01:22:20,904 --> 01:22:22,134
She couldn't help us with Hendricks.

768
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:23,490
So let's throw her off the building!

769
01:22:23,594 --> 01:22:24,626
I didn't throw her.

770
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:25,950
Let's throw her off the building!

771
01:22:26,055 --> 01:22:28,208
She was not the mission, Jane!

772
01:22:28,338 --> 01:22:33,249
The mission was to track the file
back to Hendricks, who is in the wind

773
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:35,461
with nuclear launch codes!

774
01:22:35,595 --> 01:22:38,347
Maybe you didn't notice the gun
she had pointed at me.

775
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:40,631
Yeah, like you didn't notice
the open window,

776
01:22:40,766 --> 01:22:42,593
or that we're about a mile up in the air!

777
01:22:42,726 --> 01:22:44,304
It was an instinctive move.

778
01:22:44,437 --> 01:22:45,474
It doesn't matter!

779
01:22:45,578 --> 01:22:47,306
We're talking about a nuclear war.

780
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,895
The asset is more important than you.

781
01:22:50,025 --> 01:22:52,314
Where do you get off telling me
how well I executed?

782
01:22:52,445 --> 01:22:53,643
We inherited you.

783
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:56,231
You're just a bureaucrat!

784
01:22:56,365 --> 01:22:58,737
Better have good news for me.
Is he here?

785
01:22:58,868 --> 01:23:01,109
You think I need you to tell me
what the mission is?

786
01:23:01,245 --> 01:23:03,997
Yeah, I got it. Dunhill lighter.
I'll be there.

787
01:23:04,123 --> 01:23:05,747
And no one will be following me.

788
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,618
Just make sure no one's following you.

789
01:23:07,752 --> 01:23:09,472
And how the hell
did the Russians find us?

790
01:23:09,576 --> 01:23:11,745
- What are you asking me for?
- Because you're communications!

791
01:23:11,849 --> 01:23:13,172
You're in charge of covering our tracks.

792
01:23:13,299 --> 01:23:16,086
You cannot afford to make mistakes
like that now, Benji.

793
01:23:16,218 --> 01:23:18,512
You're not a technician any more.
You're a field agent.

794
01:23:18,637 --> 01:23:21,128
And you're just an "analyst."

795
01:23:21,265 --> 01:23:22,308
Right?

796
01:23:23,142 --> 01:23:24,257
Right?

797
01:23:25,603 --> 01:23:27,595
Who are you really, Brandt?

798
01:23:29,315 --> 01:23:31,142
- What are you asking?
- What am I asking?

799
01:23:31,275 --> 01:23:32,935
Let me see if I can put it another way.

800
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:44,287
How does an agent with skills like that
end up an analyst?

801
01:23:52,504 --> 01:23:54,627
Well, we all have our secrets.

802
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:57,752
Don't we, Ethan?

803
01:24:02,722 --> 01:24:05,296
You tell me yours, I'll tell you mine.

804
01:24:25,036 --> 01:24:27,243
I have friends in the region.
Just sit tight.

805
01:24:27,372 --> 01:24:28,988
I'll send someone to get you out of here.

806
01:24:29,092 --> 01:24:30,344
What about Hendricks?
What's the plan?

807
01:24:30,448 --> 01:24:32,913
The plan was for us
to stop him together.

808
01:24:33,378 --> 01:24:35,501
Well, what are you going to do?

809
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:36,668
Change the plan.

810
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:38,915
Wait. That's it?

811
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,921
What are you going to do,
go after him alone?

812
01:24:43,555 --> 01:24:46,639
Would you care to explain yourself,
Agent Brandt?

813
01:25:50,496 --> 01:25:53,497
I was on a protection detail in Croatia.

814
01:25:53,624 --> 01:25:56,708
Shadowing the assets,
husband and wife.

815
01:25:57,836 --> 01:25:59,744
They were never supposed to know
we were there.

816
01:25:59,849 --> 01:26:02,465
Whole thing's routine, it was a milk run.

817
01:26:05,134 --> 01:26:06,593
Three days in

818
01:26:07,804 --> 01:26:11,386
we caught wind that a Serbian hit squad
was after our couple.

819
01:26:11,516 --> 01:26:14,054
But my team had it under control.

820
01:26:14,185 --> 01:26:16,094
We knew they were coming.

821
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:20,982
But I couldn't shake this feeling that I
should warn the couple somehow.

822
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,434
I wanted to find a way to let them know.

823
01:26:25,822 --> 01:26:28,739
But, you know, orders are orders,
so I didn't.

824
01:26:33,704 --> 01:26:38,034
One day, the husband decides
to leave the hotel and go for a run,

825
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:42,117
so I follow him,
and I leave two men with the wife.

826
01:26:43,756 --> 01:26:47,801
When I get back, my guys are
unconscious and the wife is gone.

827
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:52,639
Local police found her body
three days later.

828
01:26:53,766 --> 01:26:55,640
What was left of her, anyway.

829
01:27:01,357 --> 01:27:03,682
That was my last day in the field.

830
01:27:04,777 --> 01:27:07,778
I couldn't face another
life-or-death situation after that.

831
01:27:07,905 --> 01:27:10,442
So what happened to the husband?

832
01:27:10,574 --> 01:27:11,688
I never saw him again.

833
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,368
Until two days ago in Moscow,

834
01:27:15,495 --> 01:27:18,200
when the Secretary
introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

835
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,376
No, that's not what happened.
She left him.

836
01:27:25,505 --> 01:27:28,210
Yeah, I heard that one, too, Benji.

837
01:27:28,717 --> 01:27:31,634
But, unfortunately, I was there.

838
01:27:33,054 --> 01:27:36,803
Just like I was there
when the Secretary got the phone call

839
01:27:36,933 --> 01:27:41,227
that Ethan was in custody for killing
six Serbian nationals in cold blood.

840
01:27:41,354 --> 01:27:42,434
An unsanctioned hit.

841
01:27:42,564 --> 01:27:43,601
Yeah.

842
01:27:43,706 --> 01:27:45,398
Disavowed.

843
01:27:54,117 --> 01:27:55,315
The next thing I know,

844
01:27:56,286 --> 01:27:58,195
I'm on a plane to Dubai,

845
01:27:59,956 --> 01:28:03,325
wondering the whole time, do I tell him?

846
01:28:05,587 --> 01:28:07,212
How do I tell him?

847
01:28:09,508 --> 01:28:11,251
That I'm responsible.

848
01:28:13,887 --> 01:28:15,002
I could have warned him.

849
01:28:15,138 --> 01:28:17,094
I should have warned him.

850
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,011
But I didn't.

851
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,229
And she died.

852
01:28:30,736 --> 01:28:34,354
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

853
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:37,491
I told you I would get him here.
Didn't I say?

854
01:28:37,618 --> 01:28:38,697
How do I know it's him?

855
01:28:38,828 --> 01:28:42,244
Yes, it's him.
You trust me, I trust you. Right?

856
01:28:42,832 --> 01:28:44,242
This is the guy!

857
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:46,996
This is the guy, the one I told you about.

858
01:28:47,128 --> 01:28:49,666
So we can take these things off.

859
01:28:54,468 --> 01:28:57,303
Sorry. He's a great guy,
but he doesn't know you like I do.

860
01:28:57,430 --> 01:29:00,430
So, you work for
the American government.

861
01:29:01,892 --> 01:29:03,351
And you're an arms dealer.

862
01:29:03,477 --> 01:29:05,766
No, no, no. Sergei. Sergei.

863
01:29:06,397 --> 01:29:10,395
He's "independent
defence coordinator." Right?

864
01:29:11,652 --> 01:29:13,561
That you are. Very classy job.

865
01:29:13,696 --> 01:29:14,739
Listen. He's a friend.

866
01:29:14,864 --> 01:29:16,358
Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

867
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:18,483
No, no. It's okay. You can have them.

868
01:29:18,617 --> 01:29:21,702
Whatever arrangements you made with
my cousin is between you and him.

869
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:24,663
You want something from me, you pay.

870
01:29:24,789 --> 01:29:29,001
You misunderstand.
I'm not buying. I'm selling.

871
01:29:29,794 --> 01:29:31,870
You're selling.

872
01:29:32,005 --> 01:29:33,203
Selling what?

873
01:29:33,339 --> 01:29:34,668
The future.

874
01:29:34,799 --> 01:29:37,551
Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.

875
01:29:37,677 --> 01:29:39,302
Our countries are on the brink of war.

876
01:29:39,929 --> 01:29:41,756
War is very good for business.

877
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,384
Nuclear war?

878
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:54,903
Go on.

879
01:29:55,028 --> 01:29:56,937
I'm looking for a man
named Kurt Hendricks.

880
01:29:57,072 --> 01:29:58,649
You may know him as Cobalt.

881
01:29:58,782 --> 01:30:01,486
In either case,
I think you know what he wants.

882
01:30:01,618 --> 01:30:04,239
I'll bet he even tried
to buy it from you at some point.

883
01:30:05,705 --> 01:30:06,743
Go on.

884
01:30:06,847 --> 01:30:08,871
He has a case, he has codes.

885
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:12,918
But they're worthless
without a tactical satellite.

886
01:30:13,046 --> 01:30:15,335
I want to know where he'd get it.

887
01:30:16,049 --> 01:30:19,500
A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

888
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,379
And to your government,

889
01:30:22,514 --> 01:30:26,558
a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

890
01:30:29,561 --> 01:30:30,604
If you help me,

891
01:30:31,897 --> 01:30:34,851
my friends become your friends.

892
01:30:38,028 --> 01:30:39,143
Sorry.

893
01:30:40,489 --> 01:30:42,113
I cannot help you.

894
01:30:47,663 --> 01:30:50,664
I certainly cannot tell you
that Russia quietly sold

895
01:30:50,791 --> 01:30:54,539
an obsolete tactical satellite
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

896
01:30:56,422 --> 01:30:58,295
And whoever gave them that idea?

897
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,174
An enterprising third party.

898
01:31:02,302 --> 01:31:03,761
Working on commission.

899
01:31:03,887 --> 01:31:07,091
Helping old friends. Making new ones.

900
01:31:07,808 --> 01:31:09,136
Can the satellite be shut down?

901
01:31:09,268 --> 01:31:11,141
That would take special skills,

902
01:31:12,104 --> 01:31:13,563
and you cannot do it alone.

903
01:31:39,964 --> 01:31:41,542
What's in the bags?

904
01:31:41,674 --> 01:31:43,003
It's our gear.

905
01:31:43,134 --> 01:31:44,877
How'd you get it?

906
01:31:45,011 --> 01:31:46,125
Made a friend.

907
01:31:47,305 --> 01:31:48,514
Well, I'm glad we could help.

908
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,383
You could help now.

909
01:31:50,516 --> 01:31:52,343
Look, Ethan, before we...

910
01:31:52,477 --> 01:31:53,675
Whatever happened, happened.

911
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:57,023
We still have a chance to clean this up,
but we have to do it now.

912
01:31:58,024 --> 01:32:00,182
And we have to do it together.

913
01:32:07,492 --> 01:32:08,820
Okay. So, where are we going?

914
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,662
India.

915
01:32:15,124 --> 01:32:16,618
- India? India?
- Sure.

916
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:17,794
Okay. Great.

917
01:32:21,506 --> 01:32:22,964
Love the jet.

918
01:32:23,716 --> 01:32:25,460
Wait till you see the car.

919
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,142
Sidorov.

920
01:32:33,309 --> 01:32:34,803
<i>How have you been, old friend?</i>

921
01:32:35,019 --> 01:32:36,098
Oh, it's you.

922
01:32:37,105 --> 01:32:40,224
I've been busy with other things.

923
01:32:40,358 --> 01:32:42,267
<i>But I'll be after you again soon enough.</i>

924
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:47,696
I understand you're looking for an American...

925
01:32:47,906 --> 01:32:48,949
I am.

926
01:32:50,033 --> 01:32:53,485
You're also looking for a nuclear launch device
stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.

927
01:32:53,589 --> 01:32:56,925
<i>You're also looking for a nuclear launch device</i>
<i>stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.</i>

928
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,796
I am?

929
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,866
I can help you find both.

930
01:33:00,877 --> 01:33:03,795
If... we can come to an understanding.

931
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:11,132
Brij Nath.

932
01:33:11,263 --> 01:33:13,718
Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

933
01:33:13,849 --> 01:33:16,766
On the surface,
his entire network is state-of-the-art.

934
01:33:16,893 --> 01:33:18,767
But it's built on illegally acquired

935
01:33:18,895 --> 01:33:22,727
Cold War cast-offs, including this,
the Novosti satellite.

936
01:33:22,858 --> 01:33:24,703
Hendricks needs it
to launch a nuclear strike,

937
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,190
and we have to shut it down
before he gets that chance.

938
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,858
And to do that, we need to get
the access code from him.

939
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:31,270
One way or another.

940
01:33:32,576 --> 01:33:34,070
And if I don't,

941
01:33:35,078 --> 01:33:36,572
none of this works.

942
01:33:37,914 --> 01:33:38,994
You can do this.

943
01:33:39,124 --> 01:33:40,203
Yeah.

944
01:33:41,084 --> 01:33:43,836
A week ago, I would have believed you.

945
01:33:49,092 --> 01:33:51,463
I don't blame you for what happened.

946
01:33:56,265 --> 01:33:59,883
She took someone you cared about.
That's not something you just

947
01:34:00,352 --> 01:34:01,395
let go.

948
01:34:03,105 --> 01:34:05,181
Did it make you feel better?

949
01:34:07,735 --> 01:34:10,605
When you killed the men
who killed your wife?

950
01:34:18,746 --> 01:34:20,573
We can't get them back.

951
01:34:27,004 --> 01:34:28,308
Okay, to shut down the satellite,

952
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:31,090
we have to manually tap into
the central server.

953
01:34:31,217 --> 01:34:34,799
You'll enter through the exhaust vent,
wearing this under your suit.

954
01:34:34,929 --> 01:34:37,502
Drop down into the computer array,
and I'll catch you,

955
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,925
then move you along the relay room
and you jack into the panel.

956
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:47,185
Okay, so we enter the party
separately as guests.

957
01:34:47,316 --> 01:34:49,060
Ethan quarterbacks while Jane...

958
01:34:49,193 --> 01:34:50,684
Gets the codes from the billionaire.

959
01:34:50,788 --> 01:34:52,936
I switch off the fan,
you jump into the computer array,

960
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:54,898
and I catch you,
you plug in the transmitter

961
01:34:55,032 --> 01:34:58,649
then Ethan feeds me the codes which I
then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

962
01:34:58,785 --> 01:35:01,905
Okay, but you just breezed over
something I think is really important.

963
01:35:02,038 --> 01:35:04,825
The computer array part, where I just...

964
01:35:05,917 --> 01:35:06,960
Jump?

965
01:35:07,794 --> 01:35:09,372
- And I catch you.
- Yeah.

966
01:35:09,504 --> 01:35:11,212
I don't... Why is that so hard to grasp?

967
01:35:11,923 --> 01:35:12,961
Well...

968
01:35:13,065 --> 01:35:17,711
Why? It's a 25-foot drop.
And we're using magnets.

969
01:35:17,846 --> 01:35:19,126
Yeah.

970
01:35:19,931 --> 01:35:22,967
In light of our recent efforts,
the technology's...

971
01:35:23,101 --> 01:35:25,010
The science is sound. All right?

972
01:35:25,145 --> 01:35:26,722
I'd be more worried about the heat.

973
01:35:28,064 --> 01:35:30,140
And then there's that. What heat?

974
01:35:30,984 --> 01:35:32,391
Well, it's like any computer, isn't it?

975
01:35:32,496 --> 01:35:35,231
If you switch off the fan,
it's gonna get really hot!

976
01:35:35,363 --> 01:35:36,406
Of course.

977
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:38,109
Relatively, you know.

978
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:43,110
Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a...

979
01:35:44,581 --> 01:35:47,498
An oven, essentially.

980
01:35:48,168 --> 01:35:49,792
Yeah. Essentially.

981
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:52,293
But I'll catch you.

982
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:55,330
Great.

983
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:26,533
<i>Aapka swagat hai,</i> sir. Welcome, sir.

984
01:37:18,256 --> 01:37:19,584
Comm check.

985
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:22,969
Saturn's got your five-by-five, Jupiter.

986
01:37:24,637 --> 01:37:26,096
This is Pluto.

987
01:37:28,307 --> 01:37:30,347
I have arrived at the party.

988
01:37:33,813 --> 01:37:34,856
There he is.

989
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:48,612
Get us that code.

990
01:37:57,336 --> 01:37:59,080
Venus moving in on target.

991
01:38:10,975 --> 01:38:12,256
Hook's in.

992
01:38:14,353 --> 01:38:16,311
You do make an impression.

993
01:38:20,275 --> 01:38:21,318
Why am I Pluto?

994
01:38:21,443 --> 01:38:23,234
<i>It's not even a planet any more.</i>

995
01:38:23,361 --> 01:38:25,069
Well, I think Uranus is available.

996
01:38:25,197 --> 01:38:27,438
It's funny 'cause you said "anus."

997
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,923
I'm in position.

998
01:38:43,465 --> 01:38:45,208
Sending in the Rover.

999
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:51,051
He's moving to you.

1000
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:52,841
<i>Give him your back.</i>

1001
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:55,529
<i>Don't want to make it too easy for him.</i>

1002
01:38:55,633 --> 01:38:57,145
Are you gonna be talking
the whole time?

1003
01:38:58,146 --> 01:39:01,480
In 20 minutes, I want a glass of
Cuvée Louis in every guest's hand.

1004
01:39:01,608 --> 01:39:04,705
And make sure all of them have a bottle
to take home by the end of the night.

1005
01:39:04,809 --> 01:39:05,852
Sure.

1006
01:39:09,408 --> 01:39:10,570
Impressed yet?

1007
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:13,404
I'm more of a bourbon girl.

1008
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:20,705
I'm Brij Nath.

1009
01:39:21,253 --> 01:39:23,245
Welcome to my humble home.

1010
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,402
<i>And Rover's in position.</i>

1011
01:39:48,779 --> 01:39:49,942
Spinning down the turbine.

1012
01:39:58,164 --> 01:39:59,206
<i>He's e-mailing.</i>

1013
01:39:59,874 --> 01:40:01,332
Venus. Be Venus.

1014
01:40:01,459 --> 01:40:02,739
<i>Be Venus.</i>

1015
01:40:11,093 --> 01:40:12,256
Husband?

1016
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:14,013
Boyfriend?

1017
01:40:15,014 --> 01:40:16,294
More of a

1018
01:40:17,266 --> 01:40:18,309
co-worker.

1019
01:40:19,101 --> 01:40:21,058
Saturn, take the leap.

1020
01:40:25,691 --> 01:40:26,770
Okay.

1021
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,190
Jumping.

1022
01:40:32,323 --> 01:40:33,946
Jumping now.

1023
01:40:36,326 --> 01:40:37,363
Jump now?

1024
01:40:37,468 --> 01:40:39,445
Yes. Commit. Jump.

1025
01:40:39,788 --> 01:40:41,412
- Jump.
- Jump.

1026
01:40:41,539 --> 01:40:43,413
- And I catch you.
- Now.

1027
01:40:47,003 --> 01:40:50,087
So, you're sure
about this suit, right, Benji?

1028
01:40:50,215 --> 01:40:51,257
Pretty sure.

1029
01:40:52,008 --> 01:40:54,760
Now you're pretty sure?

1030
01:40:55,887 --> 01:40:56,930
Jump.

1031
01:40:58,014 --> 01:41:00,137
Oh, God. All right.

1032
01:41:01,184 --> 01:41:02,227
Jump.

1033
01:41:03,603 --> 01:41:04,646
Jump!

1034
01:41:22,747 --> 01:41:25,203
<i>Jupiter, he's gone.</i>

1035
01:41:29,712 --> 01:41:30,750
Did you jump?

1036
01:41:30,854 --> 01:41:32,665
Should I not have jumped?

1037
01:41:33,717 --> 01:41:34,759
'Cause I jumped!

1038
01:41:37,011 --> 01:41:38,256
Stand by.

1039
01:41:46,311 --> 01:41:47,770
I'm playing a hunch.

1040
01:41:48,897 --> 01:41:50,308
Don't hit me.

1041
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:08,792
Hello?

1042
01:42:08,959 --> 01:42:10,584
My God, you are

1043
01:42:10,711 --> 01:42:12,787
<i>a passionate creature.</i>

1044
01:42:14,757 --> 01:42:17,674
I would like to show you
my collection of art.

1045
01:42:18,385 --> 01:42:20,177
I was waiting for you to ask.

1046
01:42:20,304 --> 01:42:22,012
Then you have to find me.

1047
01:42:22,139 --> 01:42:23,302
You're on.

1048
01:42:23,432 --> 01:42:25,555
I'm heading upstairs.

1049
01:42:43,410 --> 01:42:44,869
<i>All right, now be careful,</i>

1050
01:42:44,995 --> 01:42:47,153
<i>because it's probably getting a bit hot.</i>

1051
01:42:47,288 --> 01:42:49,779
<i>We have to get to that satellite</i>
<i>before Hendricks does.</i>

1052
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,344
<i>Look left. Look up.</i>

1053
01:43:07,475 --> 01:43:10,096
<i>I find your capricious passion intriguing.</i>

1054
01:43:11,479 --> 01:43:13,602
<i>Let me tell you one thing.</i>
<i>He's not your type.</i>

1055
01:43:13,731 --> 01:43:16,934
<i>Completely not your type.</i>
<i>He's completely cold. I'm hot.</i>

1056
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:21,395
<i>Like all Indian men, I'm very hot.</i>

1057
01:43:21,531 --> 01:43:22,568
Eight o'clock.

1058
01:43:22,672 --> 01:43:23,699
<i>Hot! Very hot.</i>

1059
01:43:23,804 --> 01:43:25,526
He's at your eight o'clock.

1060
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:27,949
<i>As you move towards me,</i>
<i>you're getting hotter.</i>

1061
01:43:28,996 --> 01:43:31,867
Whoa. Up, up! Up, up!

1062
01:43:31,999 --> 01:43:34,407
Too much, too much, too much!

1063
01:43:39,006 --> 01:43:40,287
I see you.

1064
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:45,551
I'd heard you have one of the finest
private collections in the world.

1065
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:48,218
Well, at the very least, it's private.

1066
01:44:07,367 --> 01:44:09,276
Saturn? How we doing
in the relay room?

1067
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:10,454
In position.

1068
01:44:12,789 --> 01:44:14,070
I see the satellite.

1069
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:22,120
Can I help you, gentlemen?

1070
01:44:22,257 --> 01:44:23,799
I don't think so.

1071
01:44:30,223 --> 01:44:31,682
Need those codes, guys.

1072
01:44:40,609 --> 01:44:43,563
All originals from Chatarpur District.

1073
01:44:46,948 --> 01:44:49,107
You know, the Tantrics believe

1074
01:44:50,744 --> 01:44:55,453
that the <i>Swadhisthana</i> chakra hides
our most subconscious of desires.

1075
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:51,334
Uplink to satellite.
Reboot to original military specs.

1076
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:53,428
Download the virus.

1077
01:46:01,313 --> 01:46:02,558
What the hell is that?

1078
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:05,526
What the hell is that?

1079
01:46:05,651 --> 01:46:06,694
What the hell is what?

1080
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:08,016
It's going haywire!

1081
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:10,026
It's downloaded a virus
from the satellite.

1082
01:46:10,155 --> 01:46:11,395
Hendricks is killing the server

1083
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,025
<i>before we can kill the satellite.</i>

1084
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:15,197
Hendricks is reprogramming
the satellite.

1085
01:46:15,326 --> 01:46:18,363
<i>He's gonna have launch</i>
<i>capability in five minutes!</i>

1086
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:20,405
- Something wrong?
- No.

1087
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:23,247
Jane, you gotta move.
We need that code.

1088
01:46:23,376 --> 01:46:25,203
Finally we're alone.

1089
01:46:33,011 --> 01:46:35,383
Venus, now's the time. Kick his ass

1090
01:46:35,513 --> 01:46:37,138
<i>and get the code.</i>

1091
01:46:37,515 --> 01:46:40,635
We are alone, aren't we?

1092
01:46:41,352 --> 01:46:43,974
No one will interrupt us.

1093
01:46:48,359 --> 01:46:49,984
Move and I break your neck.

1094
01:46:50,111 --> 01:46:52,649
The override sequence
for the relay station.

1095
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:55,022
Say it now or never speak again.

1096
01:46:56,076 --> 01:46:57,238
The codes.

1097
01:46:58,536 --> 01:47:00,778
<i>46, 82,</i>

1098
01:47:01,706 --> 01:47:03,165
<i>93.</i>

1099
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,123
Benji, what happened?

1100
01:47:07,227 --> 01:47:08,920
The system's crashed! We're too late.

1101
01:47:09,047 --> 01:47:10,624
<i>No, no, no. He's revealed himself.</i>

1102
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:12,592
Benji, can you pinpoint
Hendricks' location?

1103
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,585
Hendricks is signalling out of a state-run

1104
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:17,546
<i>TV-station 6.7 miles from here.</i>

1105
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:18,717
Send me the coordinates.

1106
01:47:18,821 --> 01:47:20,651
Good work, Brandt.
Now get the hell out of there.

1107
01:47:20,755 --> 01:47:21,710
Back me up!

1108
01:47:21,814 --> 01:47:24,144
Jane, tie it off with Nath
and meet me at the rally point.

1109
01:47:29,733 --> 01:47:30,776
Sleep tight

1110
01:47:32,069 --> 01:47:33,896
Faster, Benji! Just straight through!

1111
01:47:38,075 --> 01:47:39,403
Wait! Stop!

1112
01:47:39,535 --> 01:47:40,993
<i>Take me through!</i>

1113
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:44,074
<i>It's not responding! A little bit of</i>
<i>patience would be appreciated!</i>

1114
01:47:59,805 --> 01:48:01,632
I can't reach the top!

1115
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,427
More fan! More fan!

1116
01:48:05,561 --> 01:48:06,889
<i>More fan!</i>

1117
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,847
There's nothing I can do! It's maxed out!

1118
01:48:26,289 --> 01:48:27,451
<i>Brandt?</i>

1119
01:48:27,582 --> 01:48:28,744
<i>Brandt?</i>

1120
01:48:30,334 --> 01:48:33,620
Next time, I get to seduce the rich guy.

1121
01:48:44,474 --> 01:48:46,680
Satellite weaponised and online.

1122
01:48:46,809 --> 01:48:49,135
Upload the new authentication codes.

1123
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:51,230
Lock Russian Central Command
out of the system.

1124
01:48:51,647 --> 01:48:53,023
Isolate the sub.

1125
01:48:53,149 --> 01:48:57,775
We'll fire just one missile,
an apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

1126
01:48:58,321 --> 01:49:00,064
That should start the ball rolling.

1127
01:49:00,198 --> 01:49:01,240
<i>I'm here, Ethan.</i>

1128
01:49:01,365 --> 01:49:03,405
How long until Hendricks
can launch a missile?

1129
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:05,821
Less than 30 seconds!

1130
01:49:07,538 --> 01:49:09,365
We need another route.

1131
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,502
Turn left up ahead,
take the alley on the right.

1132
01:49:27,433 --> 01:49:28,476
We have uplink.

1133
01:49:39,152 --> 01:49:41,690
Ethan, Hendricks
has started the launch sequence.

1134
01:49:41,822 --> 01:49:43,480
How much time until missiles are flying?

1135
01:49:43,584 --> 01:49:44,771
<i>Three minutes!</i>

1136
01:49:48,578 --> 01:49:50,038
We're three and a half minutes out.

1137
01:49:53,542 --> 01:49:54,584
We can make it.

1138
01:49:56,378 --> 01:49:57,421
We can make it.

1139
01:50:03,969 --> 01:50:05,011
Captain...

1140
01:50:09,766 --> 01:50:12,222
Connect to Central Command
for launch verification.

1141
01:50:12,352 --> 01:50:13,395
Right away.

1142
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:17,899
Proceed with operation "Iron Fist".

1143
01:50:18,108 --> 01:50:19,851
<i>Command to Launch is confirmed.</i>

1144
01:50:20,277 --> 01:50:22,186
Cease all further communication.

1145
01:50:22,404 --> 01:50:23,447
<i>Over and out.</i>

1146
01:50:25,824 --> 01:50:26,987
Next left.

1147
01:50:40,504 --> 01:50:41,547
Proceed.

1148
01:51:02,818 --> 01:51:04,977
Ethan? We're too late.

1149
01:51:05,112 --> 01:51:07,069
<i>The missile's in the air.</i>

1150
01:51:19,502 --> 01:51:21,264
There has to be a way
to abort the warhead.

1151
01:51:21,368 --> 01:51:23,182
If there is one,
it'll be on the launch device.

1152
01:51:23,287 --> 01:51:24,500
We're gonna get that case.

1153
01:51:35,226 --> 01:51:37,764
May there be peace on Earth.

1154
01:51:42,817 --> 01:51:44,393
Disable the relay.

1155
01:51:45,819 --> 01:51:47,858
Get Wistrom! Inside, inside!

1156
01:52:22,397 --> 01:52:24,224
Wistrom destroyed the relay.

1157
01:52:24,357 --> 01:52:25,932
Ethan went after Hendricks
and the case, but...

1158
01:52:26,036 --> 01:52:28,267
Doesn't matter if he has the case.
We can't transmit the abort codes.

1159
01:52:28,372 --> 01:52:29,279
Can you fix it?

1160
01:52:29,383 --> 01:52:31,906
Yeah... It's gonna be pointless
if we don't have any power.

1161
01:52:32,031 --> 01:52:33,074
Wistrom!

1162
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:36,742
- Jane!
- I'm okay.

1163
01:52:38,538 --> 01:52:40,780
No, you are not okay. She's hit.

1164
01:52:41,249 --> 01:52:42,791
You stay here and cover Benji.

1165
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:45,871
Benji, get this thing rewired
and back online. I'll get the power on.

1166
01:52:46,004 --> 01:52:47,498
We can do this.

1167
01:56:01,947 --> 01:56:04,698
I'm taking that briefcase!

1168
01:56:08,286 --> 01:56:09,745
No! No!

1169
01:56:57,084 --> 01:56:58,495
He's been gone too long.

1170
01:56:58,627 --> 01:57:00,038
Damn it! Listen.

1171
01:57:00,171 --> 01:57:03,088
When the power comes on,
these two drives go into this bay, okay?

1172
01:57:47,133 --> 01:57:49,707
Mission accomplished!

1173
01:58:31,218 --> 01:58:32,416
Don't touch him!

1174
01:58:39,143 --> 01:58:40,934
This one is mine.

1175
01:58:53,115 --> 01:58:55,867
So, we are not enemies.

1176
01:58:57,828 --> 01:59:00,497
The phone call
from that arms dealer in Dubai.

1177
01:59:00,831 --> 01:59:02,373
You wanted me to find you.

1178
01:59:06,462 --> 01:59:08,454
How else to believe this?

1179
01:59:16,138 --> 01:59:17,181
Hospital?

1180
01:59:19,391 --> 01:59:21,431
<i>And in other news, eight weeks later,</i>

1181
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:23,387
<i>the debate continues.</i>

1182
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:27,518
<i>Eyewitnesses remain adamant</i>
<i>that the object was some sort of aircraft,</i>

1183
01:59:27,649 --> 01:59:31,433
<i>but officials with the Department of</i>
<i>Defence insist it was simply a meteor</i>

1184
01:59:31,570 --> 01:59:34,238
<i>large enough to be</i>
<i>visible during daylight.</i>

1185
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:36,404
You actually said that.

1186
01:59:36,783 --> 01:59:38,028
Out loud.

1187
01:59:38,701 --> 01:59:40,077
"Mission accomplished."

1188
01:59:40,203 --> 01:59:41,240
I said it.

1189
01:59:41,344 --> 01:59:43,820
You're still corny, Ethan.

1190
01:59:43,956 --> 01:59:46,744
I can't imagine
the look on that guy's face.

1191
01:59:48,586 --> 01:59:50,579
- Hey.
- This must be them.

1192
01:59:50,713 --> 01:59:53,963
Luther Stickell,
the firm of Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

1193
01:59:55,635 --> 01:59:59,419
I blew an entire weekend
on the bottom of the San Francisco Bay

1194
02:00:00,598 --> 02:00:02,507
no thanks to you clowns.

1195
02:00:04,894 --> 02:00:06,436
No, man, you know I got this.

1196
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:09,888
I know. I'll see you in Kandahar.

1197
02:00:13,736 --> 02:00:15,812
Thanks for meeting me.

1198
02:00:15,947 --> 02:00:18,189
So, I hear the insurance
company's refusing

1199
02:00:18,324 --> 02:00:20,483
to pay the claim
on that car you crashed, Ethan.

1200
02:00:20,618 --> 02:00:24,201
Something about intentional 100-metre
vertical drops not being covered.

1201
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:25,445
Go figure.

1202
02:00:29,085 --> 02:00:30,663
How's the leg?

1203
02:00:30,795 --> 02:00:31,993
Still working.

1204
02:00:33,005 --> 02:00:34,048
You?

1205
02:00:34,424 --> 02:00:35,622
Healing.

1206
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:38,625
I'm fine, by the way.

1207
02:00:40,011 --> 02:00:41,763
I mean, I'm not actually sleeping, per se.

1208
02:00:41,972 --> 02:00:44,759
You know. Cold sweats.
Middle of the night.

1209
02:00:46,476 --> 02:00:49,014
All these people
are just happy and smiling

1210
02:00:49,146 --> 02:00:50,950
and they are completely
oblivious to the fact

1211
02:00:51,054 --> 02:00:53,020
that they were almost vaporised.

1212
02:00:54,151 --> 02:00:55,728
And if it hadn't been for...

1213
02:00:55,861 --> 02:00:57,141
Dumb luck?

1214
02:00:57,654 --> 02:00:58,733
Was it?

1215
02:01:00,115 --> 02:01:03,566
I mean, look,
we were unprepared, in the dark.

1216
02:01:04,119 --> 02:01:05,399
Disavowed.

1217
02:01:06,663 --> 02:01:08,457
And the only thing
that functioned properly

1218
02:01:09,374 --> 02:01:10,868
on that mission

1219
02:01:11,877 --> 02:01:13,335
was this team.

1220
02:01:15,422 --> 02:01:17,995
I don't know how we ended up together,

1221
02:01:19,801 --> 02:01:21,177
but I'm glad we did.

1222
02:01:28,727 --> 02:01:29,842
Your missions.

1223
02:01:30,854 --> 02:01:32,681
Choose to accept them.

1224
02:01:38,278 --> 02:01:39,903
Hey, look, I'm in.

1225
02:01:40,322 --> 02:01:41,865
Seriously. It's not as if any mission

1226
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:44,066
is gonna be rougher
than the last one, is it?

1227
02:01:45,535 --> 02:01:46,779
I mean, that's just...

1228
02:01:46,911 --> 02:01:48,488
Bomb... Is it?

1229
02:02:06,931 --> 02:02:08,211
Thanks, Ethan.

1230
02:02:08,557 --> 02:02:09,720
Thank you.

1231
02:02:11,685 --> 02:02:12,723
Agent Hunt.

1232
02:02:12,827 --> 02:02:14,140
Agent Carter.

1233
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:23,823
Brandt.

1234
02:02:27,493 --> 02:02:29,026
I'm not picking up that phone, Ethan,

1235
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:31,658
because I don't think
you want me in the field.

1236
02:02:34,667 --> 02:02:36,576
I know your wife is dead.

1237
02:02:38,796 --> 02:02:40,954
I was there in Croatia.

1238
02:02:42,758 --> 02:02:44,169
I was there for one reason.

1239
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:45,416
One.

1240
02:02:46,262 --> 02:02:47,673
And I failed.

1241
02:02:52,268 --> 02:02:53,809
It was my job to protect her.

1242
02:02:54,561 --> 02:02:55,971
How do you know she's dead?

1243
02:02:59,399 --> 02:03:00,442
There was a body.

1244
02:03:00,942 --> 02:03:02,105
Did you see it?

1245
02:03:05,864 --> 02:03:07,856
You killed those Serbians.

1246
02:03:07,991 --> 02:03:09,034
I had to get her back.

1247
02:03:09,159 --> 02:03:10,653
You were sent to Rankow Prison.

1248
02:03:10,785 --> 02:03:12,568
That was a sacrifice
I was willing to make.

1249
02:03:12,673 --> 02:03:15,414
IMF suspected Hendricks
had people in Rankow.

1250
02:03:18,168 --> 02:03:20,789
And six dead Serbians
was the ideal cover.

1251
02:03:22,672 --> 02:03:24,464
Waste not, want not.

1252
02:03:41,524 --> 02:03:43,600
The Secretary never told me.

1253
02:03:46,946 --> 02:03:50,730
I accepted the Rankow Prison mission
on one condition:

1254
02:03:50,867 --> 02:03:53,025
That no one could know
she was still alive.

1255
02:03:54,662 --> 02:03:56,904
But you're telling me.

1256
02:04:05,047 --> 02:04:07,538
When did you find out
that I was in Croatia?

1257
02:04:08,258 --> 02:04:10,168
I pulled your file after India.

1258
02:04:11,095 --> 02:04:12,257
Right.

1259
02:04:14,264 --> 02:04:16,755
So you had to fake your wife's death.

1260
02:04:17,887 --> 02:04:20,976
As long as we were together,
she could never be safe.

1261
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:24,732
It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

1262
02:04:27,277 --> 02:04:28,475
It's mine.

1263
02:04:30,933 --> 02:04:31,976
Okay.

1264
02:04:35,786 --> 02:04:37,031
So we're good.

1265
02:04:38,372 --> 02:04:39,700
We're good.

1266
02:05:39,432 --> 02:05:41,140
Come on!

1267
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:02,421
<i>Good evening, Mr Hunt.</i>

1268
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:06,570
<i>36 hours ago, there was a breach</i>
<i>in our military's communication network.</i>

1269
02:06:06,755 --> 02:06:10,203
<i>Now, an emerging terror</i>
<i>organisation known as The Syndicate</i>

1270
02:06:10,338 --> 02:06:14,077
<i>has control of our entire drone fleet.</i>
<i>Their targets: Unknown.</i>

1271
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:16,968
<i>Your mission,</i>
<i>should you choose to accept it...</i>
