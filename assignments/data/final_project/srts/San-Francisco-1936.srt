00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,379
Oh, Mike.

168
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,420
I'll make you a promise, Stell.

169
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:23,436
No matter what happens...

170
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,700
I'll get that punk who did it.

171
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,009
Come on, sit down.

172
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,473
Let me get you a chair.

173
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:34,168
Take it easy.

174
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,551
Relax.

175
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:40,408
And if you need anything...

176
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,288
Steve will get it for you.

177
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,152
I'll be all right.

178
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:48,728
Where's Devitt?

179
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:49,729
He said he'd be here.

180
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:51,130
When? As soon as he could.

181
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,866
He's already had half an hour.

182
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,591
Mike... Mike, he's... He's here.

183
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,640
Hello, Mike. How is he?

184
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:02,975
Not good. What have you got?

185
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,699
Let's see.

186
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,080
Well, the suspect
is 5'10 ", 5'11",

187
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,882
weighed about 150, Caucasian,

188
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,584
approximately 30 years old.

189
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,419
Tan shirt, dark
trousers, dark shoes.

190
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:14,771
Entered the shop from the rear.

191
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,073
Pulled a gun on the owner
at approximately 4:40 p.m.

192
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,875
Wore a stocking
mask over his face.

193
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,743
Took $324, cash drawer,

194
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,445
and $110 on Beeman's person.

195
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,947
Officer Gustave Charnovski
entered the shop from the rear

196
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,114
approximately 4:45.

197
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,417
Suspect fired at the
officer and then he fled.

198
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,841
Beeman couldn't give us anymore.

199
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:32,505
No jewelry taken?

200
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:33,873
Well, then how did he get away?

201
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,207
The... back door,
the front door?

202
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,208
Run? Walk? Vehicle? How?

203
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,210
Still checking, Mike.

204
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,234
I've only got two men.

205
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,148
Well, no good, Roy.

206
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:44,717
What do you mean, no good?

207
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,385
You've got nothing. Come off it.

208
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,652
Come off it? I'm coming on it.

209
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:48,820
I'm taking this case.

210
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:50,589
Wait a minute...
This one's mine, Roy.

211
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,691
And don't say it.
Don't say a word.

212
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,860
Don't say that I'm
overstepping my authority.

213
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,396
And don't say that you've done
the best job you could so far,

214
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,731
because you did nothing.

215
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,401
A rookie cop could have
gotten more information than that.

216
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,653
Well, how much time
do you think we have?!

217
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,322
Let me tell you something, Roy.

218
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,958
If this punk gets away,
it's because you blew it.

219
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,059
Where do you come off anyway?

220
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,560
Somebody appoint
you commissioner?

221
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,895
If you don't like
what I'm doing...

222
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,063
Don't like it? That's right!

223
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,464
If you don't like
what I'm doing,

224
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,066
then you just file a complaint.

Lieutenant Stone,
Homicide. Open up.

231
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,804
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

232
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,818
I'm not a young man. And
after what happened today...

233
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,220
What happened today might have

234
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,322
kept you from
getting any older...

235
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,423
if the best cop in the city

236
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,367
hadn't laid his
life on the line.

I'll just be a minute.

238
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,376
I told your Robbery
people all I know.

239

Where were you standing
when that punk came in?

240
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,299
Um... there.

241
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,018
Uh, facing this way?

242
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,675
Uh... Uh, no, uh...

243
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,607
And he came in through the back?

244
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,980
Uh, yes.

245
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,260
And you heard nothing?

246
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:09,395
Uh, sure I heard him.

247
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,897
I, uh... Uh, turned around
and, uh, there he was.

248
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,232
And what did he say?

249
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,884
Well, I, uh... I-I... I
don't remember exactly.

250
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,220
Oh, come on, think. Try.

251
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,289
Well, I think he, uh... Uh...

252
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,359
D... "Don't move, and," uh,
"don't reach for anything."

253
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,627
Then?

254
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,396
Uh, th-then he told me to,
uh... Uh, pull down the blind

255
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,504
and, uh, put up the closed sign.

256
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,921
How did he talk? Huh?

257
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:38,957
Did he have an accent
or anything like that?

258
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,092
Uh, uh... No. No.

259
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:42,327
Okay. Then what?

260
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,711
Uh, then... Then he
told me to stand there.

261
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:48,184
Where? Here?

262
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,574
Uh... And then
he took the money.

263
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,106
Who opened the cash
register? You or him?

264
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,107
Oh, h-he did.

265
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:56,308
How? Which finger?

266
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:57,326
Which finger?

267
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,460
Yeah. Which finger did he use

268
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,461
to open the cash register?

269
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,396
Uh, well, I-I...

270
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,699
I... I think it was this one.

271
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,834
Are you sure?

272
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,585
Uh, I think so. Right-handed?

273
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,454
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

274
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:11,173
Because he shifted the
gun to his left hand, uh,

275
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,458
whi... While he took the money.

276
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:13,942
The money that you
had in your pocket,

277
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,127
how did he get that?

278
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:17,346
Well, he asked for
it, and I gave it to him.

279
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,370
How?

280
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,083
I put it in his hand.

281
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,352
Here, like this? Yeah.

282
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,554
Then you were close to
him? How about his breath?

283
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,056
Could you smell it?

284
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,059
Oh, I... I don't remember. I...

285

287
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:35,013
No. No, no, I don't...

288
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:37,037
The mask. What about the
mask? What color was it?

289
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,519
I-I don't know.

290
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:41,520
Now, you're a married man.

291
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,154
You know about
women's stockings.

292
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:44,923
Now, what color was it?

293
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:47,275
Black, white, tan,
green, red? What?

294
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,276
Oh... Tan.

295
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,912
Light or dark? Uh... Uh, light.

296
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,379
And what about the
toe, and that, uh...

297
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,381
That band around the top?

298
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,705
How should I know?

299
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,342
All right, all right.

300
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,890
You say he was in a shirt?

301
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,958
Yeah.

302
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,659
Short or long sleeves?

303
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,696
Uh, sleeves? Uh... Long.

304
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,231
Shoes. Black or brown?

305
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,232
Uh... Uh, brown.

306
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,700
What kind? Lieutenant.

307
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,103
Come on, now.
What kind? Uh... Uh...

308
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:18,763
Well, uh, new... Like, mod-like
with, uh, brass buckles, uh...

309
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,844
All right, there's more
about the shoes. What?

310
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,146
Yeah, the, uh... The
toes seemed, uh...

311
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,147
Go on, go on. Scuffed.

312
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,316
Uh... Uh...

313
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,684
And the only
reason I noticed it,

314
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,820
it was like my kid's
shoes used to be.

315
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,888
Good, good. Now...
how about the brand?

316
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,658
Um, uh, Italian maybe.

317
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,025
Uh... Uh...

318
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,763
Square-toe, like they, uh,
show in the bootstrap shop.

319
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,232
Anything else?

320
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,751
His trousers, the pants.
They were baggy in...

321
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,019
In the knees. Uh...

322
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,472
Not as expensive
as the shoes. Uh-huh.

323
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,475
Oh, I didn't realize
I noticed so much.

324
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,742
Yeah, now... Mm-hm?

325
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,010
How did he walk?

326
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,645
Like an athlete or a lead foot?

327
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,081
Oh, uh... about average.

328
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,082
And his attitude?

329
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,284
Was he calm,
cocky, uptight? What?

330
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,508
Nervous.

331

He shot Gus, didn't he?

Yeah, yeah. Mustache?

Don't know. He

Well, beat's the best

He's not gonna
get himself wasted.
