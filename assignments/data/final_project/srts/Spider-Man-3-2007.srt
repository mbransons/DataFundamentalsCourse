1
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,951
<i>It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood...</i>

2
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>you know.</i>

3
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,330
<i>I've come a long way from being
the boy who was bit by a spider.</i>

4
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,375
<i>Back then, nothing seemed
to go right for me. Now...</i>

5
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,918
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

6
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,753
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

7
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,922
<i>People really like me.</i>

8
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,842
Hey, stick around. It's gonna
start again in a couple minutes.

9
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,594
- Nah.
- That's okay.

10
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,514
<i>The city is safe and sound.</i>

11
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,641
<i>I guess I've had something
to do with that.</i>

12
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,601
<i>My Uncle Ben would be proud.</i>

13
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,568
<i>I still get to school.
Top of my class.</i>

14
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,611
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us

15
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:01,032
that the energy levels are
perturbed by the electric field.

16
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,956
From the form of this
matrix, we can see...?

17
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,125
Miss Stacy?

18
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,587
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

19
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,840
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

20
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,222
Parker? You got
something to add?

21
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,725
No, sir.

22
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:33,273
<i>And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.</i>

23
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,165
Hi.

24
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,753
Miss Watson left a ticket
for me. Peter Parker.

25
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,297
Excuse me. Sorry.

26
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,883
Thank you. Sorry.

27
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,266
Oh. I'm so nervous.

28
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,376
That's my girlfriend.

29
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,994
- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,705
Harry?

31
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,290
Harry!

32
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,167
I need to talk to you.

33
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,878
Explain things.

34
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,508
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

35
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,056
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

36
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,191
M.J.!

37
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,652
- Peter!
- Congrats!

38
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,112
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

39
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,615
- You were...
- You said great.

40
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,327
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

41
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,414
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

42
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,709
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

43
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,920
Tell me again.
Was I really good?

44
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,464
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

45
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,133
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

46
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,219
Yes, it was.
Well, it's the acoustics.

47
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,555
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

48
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,558
You see, when the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an...

49
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,727
You are such a nerd.

50
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,359
- Wow.
- Ooh.

51
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,490
Did you see that one?

52
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,544
- You know what?
- Mm.

53
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,465
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life

54
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,051
with you in the first row.

55
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,220
I'll be there.

56
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,433
Tell me you love me.

57
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,562
I love you.

58
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,273
I love you so much.

59
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,109
I always have.

60
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,283
- Ready?
- Yep.

61
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,235
You can't hide here, Flint.

62
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,781
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

63
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,743
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

64
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,413
You're nothing
but a common thief.

65
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,084
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

66
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,628
It wasn't.

67
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,964
I had good reason
for what I was doing.

68
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,340
And that's the truth.

69
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:41,719
You and the truth, sitting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

70
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,472
I live in the presence
of great truth,

71
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,975
and that is the truth
that you left behind

72
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,685
right there in that bedroom.

73
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,826
Penny.

74
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,495
I missed you.

75
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,207
I miss you too, Daddy.

76
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,722
I promise I'll make you
healthy again.

77
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,850
Whatever it takes,
I'll get the money.

78
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,103
You get out of here. Now.

79
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,366
I'm not a bad person.

80
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,329
Just had bad luck.

81
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,848
Peter, what is it?

82
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,435
It's M.J.

83
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,773
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.

84
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,608
Uh!

85
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:23,529
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

86
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,531
And excited.

87
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,492
And very young.

88
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,578
And I loved him so fiercely.

89
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,789
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

90
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,375
I wanted to say yes,
but I said no.

91
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,252
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

92
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,755
So we took our time.

93
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,299
Looked forward to it.

94
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,095
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

95
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,307
A man has to be understanding

96
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,560
and put his wife before himself.

97
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,855
Can you do that, Peter?

98
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,276
Yeah, I think I can.

99
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,780
Then you have my blessing.

100
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,952
Oh. I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

101
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,455
Your uncle had it all planned.

102
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,582
He took me to the beach
one Sunday.

103
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,544
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.

104
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,213
And I didn't look
too bad myself.

105
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,382
We were very good swimmers.

106
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,093
And it was a beautiful day
and he said,

107
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,178
"Let's swim to the island."

108
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:34,767
And at the island, we found
a perfect spot by an old tree

109
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,479
and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

110
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,899
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

111
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,819
And I did. And then
he said, "Open them."

112
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,821
And I did.

113
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,866
And he was holding this ring.

114
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,660
Dazzling,

115
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,579
in front of me.

116
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,333
I thought it was the sun.

117
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,589
We'd be married 50 years...

118
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,342
come August, if...

119
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,350
So...

120
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:23,357
I hope you'll make it
very special for Mary Jane.

121
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,236
Do something
she'll never forget.

122
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,866
Give her this.

123
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,245
Go on. Take it.

124
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,908
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

125
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,123
Listen to me.
I didn't kill your father.

126
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,960
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself.

127
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,878
Shut up!

128
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,233
I'm still here, Peter.

129
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,342
Hate those things.

130
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,094
Oh!

131
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,486
Harry?

132
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,908
Harry.

133
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,494
Harry!

134
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,250
Oh, my God.

135
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,425
Harry!

136
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,179
Come on!

137
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,517
God.

138
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,396
- Defib.
- Two hundred.

139
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,357
And clear.

140
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,733
No response.

141
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,693
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

142
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,238
- Charging.
- And clear.

143
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,447
No response.

144
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,826
Let's recharge and do
it one more time. And clear.

145
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,041
Captain Stacy.

146
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,085
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

147
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,379
The guy we tied to the
Ben Parker homicide.

148
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,426
- What about him?
- He just broke out of Rikers.

149
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,882
- And?
- He's on the run.

150
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,218
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

151
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,140
There he is.

152
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,745
You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.

153
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,793
Where did he go?

154
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,609
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

155
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,777
Donnie, we got a little
fluctuation on one.

156
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,529
There's a change
in the silicon mass.

157
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,008
Yeah, it's probably a bird.
It'll fly away when we fire it up.

158
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,617
Initiating demolecularization.

159
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,625
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

160
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,211
But there's been some
memory impairment.

161
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,046
Particularly his
short-term memory.

162
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,257
Right now he can't
remember the accident

163
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,551
or anything that happened
to him recently.

164
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,969
Is it permanent?

165
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,180
It could be.
Only time will tell.

166
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:16,932
He's awake if you wanna see him.

167
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,226
Oh. Maybe I should wait.

168
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,730
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

169
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,167
Hey, buddy.

170
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,252
Hey.

171
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,546
Hit my head.

172
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,214
Yeah.

173
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,759
Doctor said I was
in an accident.

174
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,010
Hit-and-run.

175
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,263
I don't remember
much of anything.

176
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,433
My father...

177
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,518
he died, right?

178
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,273
This is all so weird.

179
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,986
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

180
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,196
I know that face.

181
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,906
How you doing?

182
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,574
I don't know.

183
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,785
Last thing I remember,
I was fine.

184
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,119
Somewhere.

185
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,080
You're still fine.

186
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,458
We love you, Harry.

187
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,127
It feels like...

188
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,423
somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

189
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,718
And now I'm back home.

190
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,554
It's good to have you back.

191
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,642
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to
ask you guys to scoot, okay?

192
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,144
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

193
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,271
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

194
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,482
Yeah. Great.

195
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,818
Get some sleep.

196
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,782
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

197
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,576
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

198
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,331
You have lovely friends.

199
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,625
My best friends.

200
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,463
I'd give my life for them.

201
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,946
- Yeah?
- It's me.

202
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,073
On! Hey.

203
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,201
Peter, you know
I can't open the door.

204
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,786
It's stuck again?

205
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,372
Just come on and help me.

206
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,124
I'm coming.

207
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,715
- Hey.
- The review.

208
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,091
Uh!

209
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,386
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

210
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,805
"The young Miss Watson
is a pretty girl,

211
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,099
easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

212
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,560
Her small voice didn't carry
past the first row."

213
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,812
That's ridiculous,
I was right there.

214
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,564
You were in the first row.

215
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,068
Yeah, this...
Listen, you were great.

216
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,655
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

217
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,326
Believe me, I know. Spider-Man
gets attacked all the time.

218
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:13,497
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

219
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:17,125
I know, and I'm just saying
you can't let it bring you down.

220
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,087
You just gotta believe in yourself
and you pull yourself together.

221
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,922
You get right back
on the horse and...

222
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,924
Don't give me the horse thing.

223
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,510
Try and understand how I feel.

224
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,141
It's just...

225
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,271
I look at these words...

226
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,566
and it's like my father
wrote them.

227
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,822
<i>All cars-All cars in the vicinity of
54th and Sixth Avenue, please report.</i>

228
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,658
<i>Crane out of control,
approach with caution.</i>

229
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,621
"Go get them, tiger"?

230
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,500
I'm sorry.

231
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,994
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

232
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,997
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

233
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,666
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

234
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,302
Shut it down
at the generator. Now!

235
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,017
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

236
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,023
What is that thing
doing in my background?

237
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,611
Captain Stacy, they got some kind of short
up there. They can't shut down the crane.

238
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,471
Get Edison on the phone. Have them
kill the power to the whole block.

239
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,226
Are you all right?

240
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,019
It's coming back.

241
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,147
Oh, no.

242
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,882
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

243
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,430
What's she doing up there?

244
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,517
I don't know, I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modelling gig.

245
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,520
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

246
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,438
And I work at the <i>Daily Bugle.</i>

247
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,567
And I'm dating your daughter.

248
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,290
You Okay?

249
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,834
Yeah, I'm fine.

250
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,044
Thank you.

251
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,588
Hey, Spidey, hold on.
<i>Bugle</i> needs a photo.

252
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,590
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy.

253
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,675
Hey. I'm the new guy.

254
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,926
New Guy?

255
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,638
You Okay?

256
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,682
From now on, I am gonna be
taking shots of you for the Bugle.

257
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,685
So smile. Are you smiling?
Just kidding.

258
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,896
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

259
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:52,984
Um, yeah, look, just between you
and me, guy's kind of an amateur.

260
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,862
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

261
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,323
Just... Yeah, a little chunky.

262
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,325
Okay-

263
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,120
But you don't have to worry
about that anymore, buddy.

264
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,380
Dazzle me.

265
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,969
Pow. Zap.

266
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,890
Just a little something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.

267
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,976
As you know, circulation at
the <i>Bugle</i>'s been pretty good.

268
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,062
Though not as good
as <i>The New York Times.</i>

269
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,690
Or the <i>Daily News,</i> or the Post,
or several other smaller...

270
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,016
Get on with it, you moron...!

271
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,360
What?

272
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,339
Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson. Your wife
told me to tell you to watch the anger.

273
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,656
You tell my wife...

274
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,078
Thank you.

275
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,916
So I propose this campaign.

276
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,544
<i>"Daily Bugle."</i> That's obvious.

277
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,839
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

278
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,426
"It's wow." That's actually
Erickson. He goes crazy.

279
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,011
We gave him a couple lattes,
it's like, phew!

280
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,805
"And how." That's me again.

281
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,392
Time to take your pill.

282
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,061
Not that one.

283
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,731
Not that one.

284
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,283
Drink plenty of water.

285
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,621
Thank you.

286
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,958
Continue.

287
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,963
- He's busy.
- Oh, no.

288
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,883
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.
- What's that smell?

289
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,344
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

290
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,138
It's called Go Away.

291
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,265
Get out! That is the dumbest
idea you've ever had,

292
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,310
- and you have had some doozies.
- Blood pressure.

293
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,479
Hey, where are you going?

294
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,691
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

295
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,778
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

296
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,131
- Who? What...?
- Can I just say I really like that shirt?

297
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,355
Here, it's the crane accident.

298
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,408
- Check out the light source.
- He likes my shirt.

299
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,618
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

300
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,495
You better get in there.
New guy.

301
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,663
He's trying to sell
some Spidey photos.

302
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,332
Oh.

303
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,626
Thanks.

304
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,754
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner here beat you to it.

305
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,506
It's Brock, sir.
Edward Brock Jr.

306
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,008
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

307
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,820
Wait, how'd you get that? I didn't see
you there. How'd you get that high?

308
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,555
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?

309
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,600
- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

310
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,018
- It's better.
- Cheaper too.

311
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,854
Congratulations, son, we'll use your shot.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

312
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,481
All right, J.J., I'm your man.

313
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,502
I know more about what makes a good picture
than any photographer in this town.

314
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:43,238
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, flagpoles or whatever.

315
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,657
It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.

316
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,951
I want a staff job, sir.

317
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:51,287
I have a girl that
I intend to marry

318
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,374
and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream

319
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:58,002
of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.

320
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,963
J. Jonah Jameson.

321
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,177
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

322
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,512
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

323
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,741
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good
picture and I've been here a long time.

324
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,035
If there's a staff job, Mr.
Jameson, I think I deserve it.

325
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,813
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with
us for years. He's done a great job.

326
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,940
You want a staff job,
and you want a staff job.

327
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,942
- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.

328
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,902
Shut up. Get out.

329
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,531
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

330
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,910
He's a fake, he's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.

331
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,371
Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.

332
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,498
Whoever brings me
that photo gets a job.

333
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,726
What are you waiting for,
Chinese New Year? Go, go, go.

334
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,168
I'm on it, boss.

335
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,921
You'll never get that shot.

336
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,423
Oh, we'll see.

337
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:02,942
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

338
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,279
Enough said.

339
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,953
Welcome home, Harry.

340
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:18,124
- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.

341
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,460
- Bernard.
- Sir.

342
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,964
Got you a little
homecoming present.

343
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,759
- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.

344
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,052
Thanks, buddy.

345
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,055
Hey, we were pretty good
in the back yard, weren't we?

346
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,892
We were terrible. And we tried
out for the varsity team.

347
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,102
- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.

348
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,813
- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.

349
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,148
You don't?

350
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,318
Hey, Bernard.
Do I have any girlfriends?

351
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,987
Not that I know of, sir.

352
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,161
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

353
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,996
It's okay.

354
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,124
- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.

355
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,087
Well, maybe I can turn this
no-girlfriend thing around.

356
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:16,516
You know, he always appreciated how
you helped me through high school.

357
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,852
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

358
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,857
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

359
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:30,363
Hey, let's watch a game in the
kitchen. Get something to eat.

360
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,698
Okay.

361
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,200
Whoa, heads up.

362
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,871
Did you see that?

363
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,874
- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.

364
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,659
Why are we stopping?

365
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,831
What is she doing here?

366
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,916
Well, Gary was
supposed to call her agent.

367
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,172
Hi, honey.
We tried to reach you.

368
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,882
I'm sorry.

369
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,175
One critic?

370
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,551
No, all the papers, dear.

371
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,929
Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.

372
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,724
Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.

373
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,695
That was so poorly handled.

374
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,363
Yeah.

375
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,741
Let's just rehearse.

376
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,749
All right, Spidey.

377
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,997
<i>Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!</i>

378
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,793
Excuse me, miss? Could I please
see that gorgeous smile?

379
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,711
Hi, Eddie.

380
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,006
You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.

381
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,943
Okay, I've gotta practice.
I'll see you later, okay?

382
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,844
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

383
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,470
Why not?

384
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,516
What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?

385
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,770
We had coffee, Eddie.

386
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,647
Hey, beautiful.

387
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,774
One more.

388
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,405
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

389
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:21,701
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.

390
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,995
Hey, I'm gonna be
swinging in from over there.

391
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,247
- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.

392
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,208
Give them a good show.

393
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,419
Don't worry about that review.

394
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:35,047
We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.

395
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,799
Yeah.

396
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,110
Isn't that that guy
from that prison break?

397
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,820
He fits.

398
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,531
Hey, you. Halt.

399
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,950
Cover the back.

400
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,581
Hon, be careful.

401
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,214
He's in the truck.

402
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,383
Round the front.

403
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,939
Fire.

404
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,631
People of the city of New York,

405
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,302
I am here today
because I fell 62 stories

406
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,095
and someone caught me.

407
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,265
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

408
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:53,102
Someone who doesn't even
want us to know who he is.

409
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,353
Hey, M.J.

410
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,856
- Harry.
- Hey.

411
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,025
- Where's Pete?
- Um...

412
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,360
- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.

413
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,322
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

414
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,823
I've never felt better.

415
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,117
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

416
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,037
Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.

417
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,539
- Will you bump me on the head?
- Bop.

418
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,960
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

419
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,838
You came. You sent me flowers.

420
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,507
I did? I'll come again tonight.

421
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,219
You can't. I was let go.

422
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,096
What happened?

423
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,224
I wasn't very good.

424
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,728
You know, this is embarrassing,

425
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,189
but I once wrote you
a play in high school.

426
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,024
- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.

427
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,776
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

428
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,154
So I ask you: When you're
dropping without a parachute

429
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,741
or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire,

430
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,993
who is it that breaks your fall,

431
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,830
puts out the flames
and saves your children?

432
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,665
Spider-Man!

433
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,917
They love me.

434
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,420
Then let's hear it
for your one and only

435
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,965
- friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
- Spider-man!

436
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:21,315
Hey. What's up?
All right. How you doing?

437
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,902
Shazam!

438
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,947
Woo-hoo! Hey, guys.

439
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,740
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

440
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,118
Hey there. Hi.

441
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,204
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

442
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,124
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

443
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,709
Go ahead, lay one on me.

444
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,628
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

445
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,296
- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.

446
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,798
No, Spider-Man, no.

447
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,842
All right.

448
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,311
Hope Pete's
getting a shot of this.

449
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,608
<i>Ack!</i>

450
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,694
Hey, hey, are you okay?

451
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,237
Yeah, I'm fine.

452
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,202
Hey, man, we got
something on the roof.

453
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,749
Oh!

454
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,059
Jig's up, pal.

455
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,687
I don't wanna hurt you.
Leave now.

456
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,066
I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.

457
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,317
Okay-

458
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,531
Uh-oh.

459
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,482
Help!

460
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,477
Where do all these guys
come from?

461
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,366
I'm sorry, I don't speak...

462
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,869
But this is a French
restaurant, <i>non</i>?

463
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,705
- <i>Oui?</i>
- Ha, ha!

464
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,083
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

465
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,005
Ah. Here we are.

466
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,383
Table for two. Parker.

467
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,596
- Parker.
- That is what I said: Parker.

468
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,975
Um, I have a request.

469
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,187
My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.

470
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,648
Ah!

471
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,445
Hello.

472
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,490
Oh, so you want to
pop the question tonight, huh?

473
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,493
Yes, and I wanna do
something very special.

474
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,121
I love it. Romance.

475
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,872
I am French.

476
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,420
When I signal you, if you'd bring
some champagne with the ring...

477
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,922
- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.

478
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,134
Also, I thought at the same time

479
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,887
if the musicians
would play this song...

480
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,057
Their favorite.

481
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,852
And take good care of the ring.

482
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,563
<i>Oui,</i> with my life, <i>monsieur.</i>

483
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,859
I like you.

484
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,905
Thank you.

485
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,206
Oh.

486
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,377
Okay, so...

487
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,213
Oh, would you like
some champagne?

488
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,969
How'd that get in there?

489
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,556
Oh, don't cry.

490
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,729
Hi.

491
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,857
Look at you. Wow, beautiful.

492
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,609
Thanks.

493
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,406
This place in your budget?

494
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,784
Oh, well, it's a
special occasion.

495
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:48,994
You're on Broadway.

496
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,372
I don't feel like
much of a star tonight.

497
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,834
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.

498
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,628
Peter...

499
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,131
you have no idea
how I feel right now.

500
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,343
Oh, no, I know
exactly how you feel.

501
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:09,181
Listen, I have been through this.
It happens to me all the time.

502
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,350
I see Spider-Man posters
in the window,

503
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,852
kids running around
with me on their sweaters...

504
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,687
Big Halloween item.

505
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,690
I don't know, I guess I've
become something of an icon.

506
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:23,529
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

507
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:27,783
I don't know, you know,
I mean, I'm thinking to myself,

508
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,870
"I'm just a nerdy kid from
Queens. Do I deserve this?"

509
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,290
Hi, Pete.

510
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,708
Hi.

511
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,511
Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

512
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,389
- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.

513
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,975
This is Mary Jane Watson.

514
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:58,355
Oh! Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.

515
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,232
Oh?

516
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:04,403
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

517
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,739
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

518
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,825
Which actually reminds me,

519
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,161
Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man,

520
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,581
could you bring it to class?

521
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:19,918
I'd really love it.
For my portfolio.

522
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,046
After all, who gets
kissed by Spider-Man, right?

523
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,549
I can't imagine.

524
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,428
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

525
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,889
- Good night.
- Good night.

526
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,068
Oh, she's in my science class.

527
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,112
It's not her best subject.

528
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:50,699
What?

529
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,118
How come you
never mentioned her?

530
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,955
She's your lab partner?

531
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,249
You saved her life?

532
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,751
She thinks you're a genius

533
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:04,296
and she had her polished
fingernails all over you?

534
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,964
Or didn't you notice?

535
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,677
And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.

536
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,972
I'll never forget that.

537
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,061
She's just a girl in my class.

538
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,979
Let me ask you something.

539
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,148
When you kissed her,

540
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,734
who was kissing her?

541
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,612
Spider-Man or Peter?

542
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,698
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

543
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,201
That was our kiss.

544
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,911
Why would you do that?

545
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,957
You must have known
how it'd make me feel.

546
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,961
- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?

547
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,672
Why would I wanna push
you away? I love you.

548
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,801
You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M.J.

549
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,429
I don't feel very well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

550
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,681
No, w...

551
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,935
- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.

552
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,023
Here we are.

553
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,563
<i>- Hi, it's M. J.
- Sing your song at the beep. Beep.</i>

554
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,483
Hello. Uh...

555
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,822
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on or...

556
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,992
<i>I don't know
if you got the messages or what.</i>

557
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,702
<i>But, uh...</i>

558
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,706
<i>I just wanna talk to you.</i>

559
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,251
Okay, call me. Bye.

560
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,139
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mr. Parker?

561
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,432
Yeah?

562
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:23,101
<i>This is Detective Neil Garrett
from the 32nd Precinct.</i>

563
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,020
<i>I'm calling on behalf
of Captain Stacy.</i>

564
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,707
<i>He would like you to come down
to the station to speak with him.</i>

565
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:31,276
Originally, we thought
that this man, Dennis Carradine,

566
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,320
was your husband's killer.

567
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,363
We were wrong.

568
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:36,948
What?

569
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,951
Turns out Mr. Carradine
was only an accomplice.

570
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,537
The actual killer
is still at large.

571
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,414
What are you talking about?

572
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,374
This is the man
who killed your husband.

573
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,131
His name is Flint Marko.

574
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,301
He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.

575
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,928
You got this wrong.

576
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,304
Two days ago he escaped.

577
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,808
Evidently, he confessed
his guilt to a cellmate,

578
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,812
and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.

579
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,909
No, wait, son.
You don't wanna do this.

580
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,081
No!

581
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,801
Hey, get in! What are you doing?

582
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,488
Would you put these
photos away, please?

583
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,907
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy,

584
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,535
but, please, be patient with us.

585
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,537
We're doing ourjob.
We will catch him.

586
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,372
No, you're not doing your job.

587
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,333
I watched my uncle die, and we
chased clown the wrong man.

588
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,545
Now you're telling me you had
suspicions for two years? Witnesses?

589
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,881
- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.

590
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,799
I have no intention
of settling down.

591
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,552
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!

592
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,062
<i>L-20 Parkway.</i>

593
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,690
<i>All officers in the vicinity,
please report.</i>

594
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,525
<i>We have an abandoned vehicle</i>

595
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,944
<i>and an elderly man
in the middle of the street.</i>

596
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,447
<i>Sorry, Wabash Avenue.</i>

597
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,743
Peter, it's M.J.

598
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,205
I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.

599
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,581
Just please open up.

600
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,591
Aunt May called me. She told
me about what happened.

601
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,426
She's worried about you.

602
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,595
I'm worried about you.

603
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,263
Don't be. I'm fine.

604
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,807
I don't want you
to do something stupid.

605
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,435
Like try to find
my uncle's killer?

606
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:13,063
And do something you'll regret.

607
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,107
Like with that other guy.

608
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:19,986
He had a gun on me. I made a move
and he fell. I told you that.

609
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,488
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

610

<i>10-22, auto at 556...</i>

- <i>Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.</i>

612
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:32,499
<i>Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9
responding to your Sixth Avenue call.</i>

613
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:36,086
Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.

614
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,798
And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty,

615
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:43,468
but I wanna be here for you.

616
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:46,805
Okay. I get it. Thank you.

617
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,599
But I'm fine. I...

618
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,601
I don't need your help.

619
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,861
Everybody needs help
sometimes, Peter.

620
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,863
Even Spider-Man.

Wow.

This feels good.

01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,350
Whoo!

635
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,103
Yeah!

636
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,027
Whoo!

637
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,954
This is something else.

638
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,332
What do you think?

639
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,585
I've never seen
anything like it.

640
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,587
I'm a physicist,
not a biologist,

641
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,465
but let me look at it in the
morning. Run some tests.

642
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,841
Can we do that now?

643
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,973
It seems to like you.

644
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,061
- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

645
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,814
It has the characteristics
of a symbiote,

646
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,109
which needs to bond
to a host to survive.

647
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:31,863
And sometimes these things
in nature, when they bind,

648
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,449
they can be hard to unbind.

649
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:39,662
<i>Bank robbery in progress,
First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark.</i>

650
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:43,666
<i>Another sandstorm is reported in the
vicinity. All cars proceed with caution.</i>

651
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,502
Marko.

652
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,265
Whoa.

653
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,934
Buddy, love the new outfit.

654
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,103
This is exactly what I need
to scoop Parker.

655
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,063
Give some of that web action.

656
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,942
See you, chump.

657
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,279
What the hell?

658
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:37,739
Flint Marko.

659
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,578
- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

660
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,373
The old man you shot
down in cold blood?

661
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,627
What does it matter to you,
anyway?

662
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,755
Everything!

663
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,795
It's time to pay, Marko!

664
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,742
Good riddance.

665
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,307
- Rent.
- Not now.

666
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,310
Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.

667
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,645
- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.

668
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:17,815
You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!

669
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,912
That wasn't cool.

670
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:35,333
He is a good boy.

671
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,961
He must be in some
kind of trouble.

672
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:30,388
Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben,

673
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,724
he was killed last night.

674
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,393
<i>Oh, my.</i>

675
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,228
What happened?

676
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:39,313
Spider-Man killed him.

677
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,400
Spider-Man?

678
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,319
I don't understand.

679
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:48,197
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

680
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,659
What happened?

681
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,080
I, uh...

682
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,291
He...

683
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,626
He was...

684
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:07,675
I thought that you'd feel...

685
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,221
He deserved it, didn't he?

686
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,599
I don't think it's for us to say

687
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:18,769
whether a person deserves
to live or die.

688
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:22,064
But, Aunt May,
he killed Uncle Ben.

689
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,775
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

690
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:28,321
But he wouldn't want us
living one second

691
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:31,198
with revenge in our hearts.

692
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:36,078
It's like a poison. It can...

693
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,998
It can take you over.

694
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:45,880
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.

695
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,563
- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.

696
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:48,693
Hello?

697
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,403
<i>Hey, Harry, it's M.J.</i>

698
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,654
Hi.

699
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,239
I need some company.

700
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,866
Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?

701
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,077
<i>Yeah, sure, come on over.</i>

702
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,538
Okay. Are you sure it's okay?

703
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,332
No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.

704
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,168
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- <i>Great.</i>

705
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,753
Bye.

706
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,923
- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

707
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,342
We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?

708
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,720
- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

709
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:19,223
- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?

710
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,058
Right away, sir.

711
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,870
Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.

712
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:44,373
- An orange?
- No, thanks.

713
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,335
Listen, I'm really sorry
for what happened earlier.

714
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:51,922
I shouldn't have yelled about that door.
It was nothing to be angry about.

715
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,008
It's no big deal.

716
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:58,304
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza sometime.

717
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:01,599
- Today's good.
- Okay.

718
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:04,435
- Have problem with the phone?
- No, no. I was just...

719
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,687
Well, I was trying
to figure out what to say.

720
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:10,608
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say,

721
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:14,111
"You're a good woman.
I am good man."

722
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,240
Hm?

723
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,118
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

724
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,369
He's calling a woman.

725
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:24,681
Are you calling Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...

726
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:28,709
This is none of your
business. Go. Go. Call.

727
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,047
- You should call.
- Thanks.

728
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,802
- Bye.
- Bye.

729
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:52,650
Hi.

730
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,280
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

731
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:00,908
Come on.

732
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,331
- I hope you like peppers.
- I love them.

733
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,190
No. Please.

734
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,495
Oh, the butter.

735
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,215
Beautiful.

736
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,471
Check this out.

737
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,018
Oh!

738
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:15,065
- Well, we can use that part.
- Um, right.

739
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,735
You've been dreaming.

740
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:21,113
Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.

741
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,116
- All right.
- When did you write that?

742
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,077
- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.

743
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:30,915
- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.

744
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:32,625
It's yours.

745
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:38,047
You know,
there's not even a scar.

746
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,300
Barely.

747
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,319
- Sorry.
- Me too.

748
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:04,615
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.

749
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,660
Mary Jane.

750
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,329
Mary Jane.

751
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:13,874
- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.

752
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,626
Just...

753
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,141
<i>You've taken your eye off the ball.</i>

754
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,816
<i>Harry.</i>

755
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:53,122
What have you done?

756
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,334
Avenge me!

757
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:04,591
- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.

758
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,969
<i>Just wish I could
remember more about him.</i>

759
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:10,180
<i>Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.</i>

760
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,434
<i>I swear on my father's
grave, Spider-Man will pay.</i>

761
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:15,936
Harry.

762
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,690
Remember me?

763
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:24,445
Yes, Father. I remember.

764
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:27,906
I was right about her.
About Peter.

765
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:30,284
About everything.

766
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:35,497
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer.

767
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,000
Make him wish he were dead.

768
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:42,046
First, we attack his heart.

769
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:54,433
<i>Hi, it's me. Sing your song
at the beep.</i>

770
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,270
<i>Hey, M.J. It's Peter.</i>

771
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:00,147
<i>Uh...</i>

772
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:03,233
<i>I wanna talk to you
about last night.</i>

773
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,111
<i>I don't know what
I was thinking.</i>

774
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:11,075
<i>I know you were just there
to help and</i> I...

775
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:14,244
<i>I don't know. I wanna see you.</i>

776
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:22,503
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.

777
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:28,258
- Yeah?
- It's Ursula.

778
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,135
Come in.

779
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,604
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

780
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,940
There's a phone call for you.

781
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,026
It's Mary Jane, she called back.

782
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:48,153
- Really?
- Yeah.

783
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,241
I put the phone
on top of the thing.

784
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,411
Thanks. Okay.

785
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,081
- Hey.
<i>- Hi.</i>

786
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,917
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to...

787
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,878
- <i>Can you meet me?</i>
- You bet.

788
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:07,464
- <i>Now?</i>
- Okay. Where?

789
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,466
<i>At the bridge in the park.</i>

790
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:10,968
- On my Way.
- <i>Okay.</i>

791
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,429
Okay. Hey. I love you.

792
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,492
You look beautiful.

793
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,370
Peonies.

794
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:43,500
- You okay?
- No.

795
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,503
There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.

796
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,505
Okay.

797
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:51,383
It's not working.

798
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,052
You and me.

799
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,555
What?

800
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,266
I don't wanna see you anymore.

801
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,685
What are you talking about?

802
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:03,896
I don't know.

803
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,400
I'm lonely.

804
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,862
You aren't there for me.

805
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,449
I can't do this.

806
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:21,371
- It's over.
- No. Please. Please don't say that.

807
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:24,708
I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.

808
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:28,545
- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.

809
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,839
We have problems.
When people have problems

810
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,717
they work it out.
They talk to each other.

811
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,557
Look, you see?

812
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,810
You know what this is?

813
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,232
- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.

814
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:51,193
I've fallen in love
with someone else.

815
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,424
Bravo.

816
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:28,772
She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.

817
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,526
There's another guy.

818
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,281
Well, how you holding up?

819
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,741
Not good.

820
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:44,705
Harry, I was gonna
propose to her.

821
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:46,873
Really?

822
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:53,088
Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.

823
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,091
I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?

824
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:59,261
It's not exactly what
she had in mind for herself.

825
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:02,514
Singing waitress? What are you...?
What are you talking about?

826
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:07,227
Well, she was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?

827
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:08,979
She was fired?

828
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:15,819
She was fired and she
told you? She didn't tell me?

829
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,906
Well, that's why
I asked you here, Pete.

830
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:23,160
I'm the other guy.

831
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:26,747
What?

832
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:29,916
Look, she came to me
one afternoon, troubled.

833
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:33,003
She needed someone
and I was there for her.

834
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,923
I've always loved her,
Pete. You know that.

835
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,884
It just...

836
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,094
started.

837
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:51,772
I don't believe this.
I don't... I don't believe you.

838
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,316
Look, I'm really sorry.

839
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,195
I just thought you should know.

840
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:09,748
- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.

841
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,876
How's the pie?

842
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,587
So good.

843
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,777
Would you like a drink?

844
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:26,116
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

845
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:28,827
Bad for the public image, right,
Mr. Key-to-the-City?

846
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:30,287
What did you do to her?

847
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:35,125
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.

848
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,211
Mary Jane and I,
we understand each other.

849
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:43,383
- She doesn't know what you are.
- Peter, she knows me very well.

850
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:47,721
And when she kissed me, it was
just like she used to kiss me.

851
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,890
That taste...

852
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:52,809
Strawberries.

853
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:30,013
How'd you like that, Spidey?

854
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,185
That all you got?

855
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,986
- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.

856
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,364
- Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.
- Ooh!

857
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,580
Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?

858
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,915
I'm done trying to convince you.

859
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:43,169
You took him from me.
He loved me.

860
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:47,257
No. He despised you.

861
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,634
You were an
embarrassment to him.

862
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,596
Oh.

863
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:57,225
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?

864
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:36,389
Spider-Man used
to make me feel safe.

865
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,475
Now I'm afraid
to walk home from work.

866
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,101
My son thought
the world of this guy.

867
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:44,147
I have a 9-year-old daughter, loves
Spider-Man. Who's she supposed to look up to?

868
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:46,900
This is the guy
they gave the key to the city to?

869
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,903
I'm gonna put some dirt
in your eye.

870
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:53,531
Cheers to the new
staff photographer.

871
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,075
Hey, I just got lucky.

872
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:56,993
This is so wonderful for you.

873
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:00,789
Well, you might wanna tell J.J.
to make a little more wall space.

874
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:09,297
Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

875
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,925
What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?

876
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,011
- There's your hero.
- Huh.

877
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:19,557
- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.

878
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:22,352
You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.

879
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:23,895
It's funny you should say that,

880
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:30,318
because I was looking through some old
photos and it looks very, uh, similar.

881
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,364
Okay. Well, I gotta
get back to work.

882
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:38,535
- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?

883
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,662
Your picture's a fake.

884
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:45,792
Oh, Parker,
you are such a boy scout.

885
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:47,961
When are you gonna
give a guy a break?

886
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,215
You want forgiveness?
Get religion.

887
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:55,969
- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

888
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:02,684
Yeah. No, we... We're
just horsing around.

889
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:07,188
Look, I'm begging you. If you do
this, I will lose everything.

890
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,607
There's not a paper in
town that will hire me.

891
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:12,110
You should've
thought of that earlier.

892
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:15,071
What are you doing, Peter?

893
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:19,451
Show this to your editor. Tell him
to check his source next time.

894
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,208
It's a fake.

895
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:31,337
Empire State Photographic
Department confirms it.

896
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,843
Pack your things.
Get out of my building.

897
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:39,471
- I was just trying...
- You're fired.

898
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,349
You know we're gonna
have to print a retraction now.

899
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,602
I haven't printed
a retraction in 20 years.

900
01:32:51,608 --> 01:32:52,650
Hello.

901
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,444
<i>Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.</i>

902
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:57,697
Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?

903
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:02,118
Quite a specimen
you left me, Parker.

904
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:07,040
Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.

905
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:08,416
Thanks.

906
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,127
- Mmm. That's good.
- <i>You know what, Parker?</i>

907
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:15,840
- Parker?
- Get me some milk.

908
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:20,178
It amplifies characteristics
of its host.

909
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:24,057
- Hey, give me another cookie.
- <i>Especially aggression.</i>

910
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,976
This could be dangerous.

911
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,647
Peter, you didn't keep any,
did you?

912
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:31,856
You got any with nuts?

913
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,526
I have some nuts.
I could make some.

914
01:33:34,692 --> 01:33:36,402
- Go make me some.
- Peter?

915
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:39,114
No, no, no. Course not.

916
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:55,380
These shots are so good.

917
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,091
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

918
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:02,011
Peter Parker. Peter.

919
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:06,474
Parker. Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.

920
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,184
Black-suit Spider-Man.

921
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,813
Peter, these are incredible.

922
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,858
- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.

923
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:19,404
If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job,

924
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,406
double the money.

925
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:47,951
Penny.

926
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,668
You are really gonna
dig this joint.

927
01:35:57,961 --> 01:36:00,004
Do you think I'm...?
I'm dressed all right?

928
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,756
Too fancy or too...?

929
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:05,635
Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.

930
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:07,095
Thank you.

931
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:10,181
Love that little giggle.

932
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:14,560
Hey, keep it open there, pops.

933
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:21,317
Oh, this is so cool.

934
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:24,153
I have never been
to a jazz club before.

935
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:30,326
Oh, I hope we can get a table.

936
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,500
Find us some shade.

937
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:40,795
Thanks, hot legs.

938
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,673
Right this way, sir.

939
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:53,141
Oh, why, thank you.

940
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:02,317
- I am so loving this.
- Oh, me too.

941
01:37:07,864 --> 01:37:11,367
- Isn't that your old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

942
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:15,872
- Do you wanna go some place else?
- Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay.

943
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:18,249
- Mary Jane, show us what you got.
- I'll take that.

944
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:27,717
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

945
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,935
Peter?

946
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:43,024
This is for you.

947
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:50,239
Double-time.

948
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:57,080
Thanks.

949
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:25,691
Now dig on this.

950
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:28,152
That is hot.

951
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:35,743
Ooh.

952
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:11,028
That was all for her?

953
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:21,205
I'm so sorry.

954
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:36,137
- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.

955
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:37,722
Okay-

956
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:42,143
Hey.

957
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:45,646
What's wrong with you?

958
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:48,357
You.

959
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:51,861
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

960
01:39:52,028 --> 01:39:54,113
Is everything okay here, Paul?

961
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,532
Yeah, is everything
okay here, Paul?

962
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:59,076
- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

963
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:02,038
- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.

964
01:40:02,205 --> 01:40:05,666
- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.

965
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:09,879
Peter, stop it!

966
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,808
Who are you?

967
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:26,896
I don't know.

968
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:01,490
It's Brock, sir.

969
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:04,118
Edward Brock Jr.

970
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:08,414
I come before you today...

971
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,584
humbled...

972
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:15,588
and humiliated...

973
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:20,635
to ask you for one thing.

974
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:28,100
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

975
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,152
Parker.

976
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:06,425
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

977
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:08,969
Hmm.

978
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:13,349
You don't seem to have changed
the room around very much.

979
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:18,020
Of course, there's not much
you could do, is there?

980
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:26,529
When we spoke on the phone,

981
01:45:26,695 --> 01:45:29,198
I sensed that something
was bothering you,

982
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:33,285
so I thought I'd just come by.

983
01:45:35,538 --> 01:45:38,040
How's Mary Jane?

984
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:40,209
I don't know.

985
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:45,047
I never heard from you.

986
01:45:45,214 --> 01:45:47,716
Did you ever propose?

987
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,389
You said...

988
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:57,810
a husband's gotta put
a wife before himself.

989
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:05,067
I'm not ready.

990
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,446
But what happened?

991
01:46:10,322 --> 01:46:12,825
You seemed so sure.

992
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,661
Yeah.

993
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:18,664
I, uh...

994
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:31,302
I hurt her, Aunt May.

995
01:46:32,678 --> 01:46:34,722
I don't know what to do.

996
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:40,394
Well, you start
by doing the hardest thing:

997
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:44,106
You forgive yourself.

998
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:49,778
I believe in you, Peter.

999
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:52,823
You're a good person.

1000
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:58,787
And I know you will
find a way to put it right.

1001
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:08,297
In time.

1002
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:28,776
End of the line, Spider-Man.

1003
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,115
I want him dead too, Flint.

1004
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:37,993
That's why I've been
looking for you.

1005
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:41,413
Oh, yeah. I know all about you.

1006
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:45,834
Like the fact that Spider-Man won't
let you help your poor daughter.

1007
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:49,296
It's just... That doesn't
seem right to me.

1008
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:54,385
Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.

1009
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:57,846
Together, he doesn't
stand a chance.

1010
01:47:58,847 --> 01:48:00,933
Interested?

1011
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:03,852
Yeah.

1012
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:06,749
So...

1013
01:49:08,292 --> 01:49:09,585
where to?

1014
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:10,794
<i>All New York is
holding its breath</i>

1015
01:49:10,795 --> 01:49:12,421
<i>All New York is
holding its breath</i>

1016
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:15,257
<i>as the hostage crisis
continues to unfold.</i>

1017
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,260
<i>Just 30 minutes ago,</i>

1018
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,512
<i>police came across
this startling sight:</i>

1019
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:22,806
<i>A young woman,
held hostage in a taxi</i>

1020
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:25,267
<i>suspended 80 stories
above the ground</i>

1021
01:49:25,434 --> 01:49:28,312
<i>in what appears to be
a giant web.</i>

1022
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:31,106
<i>Every attempt by the
police to rescue the hostage</i>

1023
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:33,108
<i>has been thwarted
by the Sandman.</i>

1024
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:37,780
<i>Compounding the danger</i>

1025
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:40,866
<i>is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure.</i>

1026
01:49:41,033 --> 01:49:44,703
<i>Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man,</i>

1027
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:48,457
<i>but he has now been identified
as something entirely different.</i>

1028
01:49:50,084 --> 01:49:53,629
<i>The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson,</i>

1029
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:57,883
<i>an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on Broadway.</i>

1030
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:25,994
<i>We're now going to take you
live to the scene,</i>

1031
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:27,830
<i>with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?</i>

1032
01:50:27,996 --> 01:50:30,541
<i>We're only about</i> a <i>hundred
feet away now, Hal,</i> and...

1033
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:34,503
<i>Wait. There seems to be some
kind of activity in the web.</i>

1034
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:38,257
<i>They seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering.</i>

1035
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:44,100
<i>Apparently, Spider-Man's being challenged
to some sort of confrontation.</i>

1036
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:45,889
<i>And that raises
serious questions</i>

1037
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:49,268
<i>about what kind of chance he'd
stand against such overwhelming...</i>

1038
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:01,155
Harry?

1039
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:06,702
I need your help.

1040
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:10,497
I can't take them both,
not by myself.

1041
01:51:17,004 --> 01:51:19,798
You don't deserve my help.

1042
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:24,178
Harry...

1043
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:26,889
she needs us.

1044
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:33,061
Get out.

1045
01:51:49,661 --> 01:51:51,914
If I may, sir?

1046
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:58,086
I've seen things in this
house I've never spoken of.

1047
01:51:58,587 --> 01:52:00,339
What are you trying to tell me?

1048
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:03,884
The night your father died

1049
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:06,511
I cleaned his wound.

1050
01:52:08,013 --> 01:52:11,600
The blade that pierced his body

1051
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:14,519
came from his glider.

1052
01:52:15,354 --> 01:52:20,150
I know you're trying to defend
your father's honor,

1053
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:25,572
but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.

1054
01:52:28,825 --> 01:52:31,203
I loved your father...

1055
01:52:32,537 --> 01:52:35,457
as I have loved you, Harry.

1056
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:38,961
As your friends love you.

1057
01:53:26,008 --> 01:53:27,259
Look.

1058
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:51,658
<i>Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!</i>

1059
01:53:57,205 --> 01:53:59,166
He seems to have
come out of nowhere

1060
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:01,335
to answer the prayers
of the city,

1061
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:03,545
just when all hope
seemed to be lost.

1062
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:12,387
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.

1063
01:54:12,554 --> 01:54:14,931
- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.

1064
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:26,902
Hey, Parker.

1065
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:28,362
My God. Eddie.

1066
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:30,739
Ooh, my spider-sense
is tingling,

1067
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:35,160
if you know what
I'm talking about.

1068
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:56,098
We can find a way to settle this.

1069
01:54:56,264 --> 01:54:57,724
You're so right.

1070
01:54:57,891 --> 01:55:01,395
I'm thinking humiliation.

1071
01:55:02,104 --> 01:55:04,439
Kind of like how
you humiliated me.

1072
01:55:05,273 --> 01:55:07,025
Do you remember?

1073
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:11,655
Do you remember
what you did to me?

1074
01:55:27,129 --> 01:55:30,799
You made me lose my girl. Now
I'm gonna make you lose yours.

1075
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:34,594
How's that sound, tiger?

1076
01:56:34,446 --> 01:56:36,156
Hold on, Mary Jane!

1077
01:57:06,311 --> 01:57:08,647
Mary Jane!

1078
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:12,877
It's hard to believe
what's happening.

1079
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:15,380
The brutality of it.

1080
01:58:16,131 --> 01:58:17,924
I don't know how
he can take any more.

1081
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:21,636
<i>This could be a tragic day
for the people of New York.</i>

1082
01:58:21,803 --> 01:58:23,805
<i>It could be the end
of Spider-Man.</i>

1083
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:41,197
Hm?

1084
01:58:50,206 --> 01:58:52,459
- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.

1085
01:59:17,484 --> 01:59:18,943
You came.

1086
01:59:26,868 --> 01:59:28,953
Looks like just
in the nick of time.

1087
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,623
A couple minutes ago wouldn't
have been so bad either.

1088
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:33,375
What are you gonna do?

1089
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,797
I may need some help over here.

1090
01:59:38,963 --> 01:59:41,383
I'm a little busy right now.

1091
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:44,302
Give me your hand.

1092
01:59:58,733 --> 02:00:01,611
Parker! Parker, where...?

1093
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,363
I need a photographer.

1094
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:04,823
Hey, kid, you want a job?

1095
02:00:04,989 --> 02:00:08,326
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.

1096
02:00:08,493 --> 02:00:11,413
- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.

1097
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:13,039
A hundred bucks?

1098
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:18,670
All right,
you little crook. Here.

1099
02:00:20,422 --> 02:00:21,756
What the...?

1100
02:00:23,717 --> 02:00:25,343
Film's extra.

1101
02:00:31,182 --> 02:00:32,976
Gotcha.

1102
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:42,277
Pete, up top.

1103
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:04,132
Mary Jane.

1104
02:01:06,301 --> 02:01:08,136
- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.

1105
02:01:08,303 --> 02:01:09,471
To what?

1106
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:15,685
- Go, buddy.
- Got her.

1107
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:28,072
You Okay?

1108
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,743
Yeah.

1109
02:01:34,496 --> 02:01:36,873
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1110
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:41,002
Am I interrupting?

1111
02:02:57,245 --> 02:02:59,080
Never wound...

1112
02:02:59,914 --> 02:03:01,958
what you can't kill.

1113
02:03:05,753 --> 02:03:09,257
Eddie, the suit,
you gotta take it off.

1114
02:03:09,424 --> 02:03:11,134
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

1115
02:03:14,053 --> 02:03:15,805
I know what it feels like.

1116
02:03:16,431 --> 02:03:18,057
It feels good.

1117
02:03:18,224 --> 02:03:20,768
The power. Everything.

1118
02:03:20,935 --> 02:03:23,438
But you'll lose yourself.

1119
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:25,899
Let it go.

1120
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:28,109
I like being bad.

1121
02:03:29,235 --> 02:03:30,987
It makes me happy.

1122
02:04:20,495 --> 02:04:21,579
Harry!

1123
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:36,946
Peter. What are you doing?

1124
02:05:37,905 --> 02:05:39,741
No!

1125
02:05:41,492 --> 02:05:42,535
Eddie!

1126
02:06:02,013 --> 02:06:03,973
- Harry.
- Mary Jane.

1127
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,975
- I'm gonna get help.
- No.

1128
02:06:06,809 --> 02:06:08,227
Stay.

1129
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:19,238
I didn't want this.

1130
02:06:23,493 --> 02:06:25,745
But I had no choice.

1131
02:06:29,457 --> 02:06:31,584
We always have a choice.

1132
02:06:31,751 --> 02:06:33,961
You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.

1133
02:06:36,464 --> 02:06:38,049
My daughter was dying.

1134
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:42,512
I needed money.

1135
02:06:47,308 --> 02:06:49,268
I was scared.

1136
02:06:56,776 --> 02:06:59,862
<i>I told your uncle
all I wanted was the car.</i>

1137
02:07:00,029 --> 02:07:01,989
- What is it?
- I need your car.

1138
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:04,992
He said to me,

1139
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:07,912
"Why don't you just put
down the gun and go home?"

1140
02:07:11,999 --> 02:07:15,002
<i>I realize now
he was just trying to help me.</i>

1141
02:07:21,717 --> 02:07:24,679
<i>Then I saw my partner
running over with the cash.</i>

1142
02:07:24,846 --> 02:07:26,013
<i>And the gun was in my hand.</i>

1143
02:07:37,692 --> 02:07:39,110
Get in.

1144
02:07:41,028 --> 02:07:43,364
<i>Did a terrible thing to you...</i>

1145
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:48,161
<i>and I spent a lot of nights
wishing I could take it back.</i>

1146
02:07:53,416 --> 02:07:56,002
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1147
02:07:56,919 --> 02:07:59,255
I just want you to understand.

1148
02:08:09,056 --> 02:08:11,684
I've done terrible things too.

1149
02:08:27,950 --> 02:08:30,745
I didn't choose to be this.

1150
02:08:39,462 --> 02:08:41,964
The only thing left of me now...

1151
02:08:44,133 --> 02:08:46,052
is my daughter.

1152
02:08:58,272 --> 02:09:00,233
I forgive you.

1153
02:09:43,609 --> 02:09:46,529
Hey, Pal. How you doing?

1154
02:09:46,696 --> 02:09:48,322
Been better.

1155
02:09:49,865 --> 02:09:51,826
We'll get you through this.

1156
02:09:55,538 --> 02:09:57,039
No.

1157
02:10:04,714 --> 02:10:06,882
I should never have hurt you...

1158
02:10:08,759 --> 02:10:11,053
said those things.

1159
02:10:12,722 --> 02:10:15,266
None of that matters, Peter.

1160
02:10:17,351 --> 02:10:19,103
You're my friend.

1161
02:10:23,858 --> 02:10:25,651
Best friend.

1162
02:10:44,545 --> 02:10:46,213
Harry.

1163
02:11:32,218 --> 02:11:34,387
<i>Whatever comes our way,</i>

1164
02:11:35,429 --> 02:11:39,642
<i>whatever battle we have raging
inside us, we always have a choice.</i>

1165
02:11:41,769 --> 02:11:43,854
<i>My friend Harry taught me that.</i>

1166
02:11:44,021 --> 02:11:47,274
<i>He chose to be
the best of himself.</i>

1167
02:11:48,109 --> 02:11:51,112
<i>It's the choices
that make us who we are,</i>

1168
02:11:51,278 --> 02:11:54,698
<i>and we can always choose
to do what's right.</i>
