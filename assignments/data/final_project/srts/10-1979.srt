1
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,380
- Ah. Come in, Mr. Webber.
- Hi, Covington. What happened?

2
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,550
I think we blew a fuse a minute ago.

3
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,060
It's as though somebody died.

4
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,180
- Come this way. Careful, now.
- Okay.

5
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,440
- Is Mr. Fallon here?
- Oh, yes, he's here.

6
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,520
Would you take this?
I'll check the fuse box.

7
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,730
- Yeah, sure, okay.
- Careful.

8
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,530
Hugh?

9
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,070
Hugh?

10
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,080
Surprise!

11
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,260
Is it 41 or 42?

12
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,260
...right in and chase the shepherds away

13
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,770
...right in and made my sunniest day

14
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,740
Happy birthday to you

15
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,160
Happy birthday to you

16
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,130
Happy birthday, dear George

17
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,260
Happy birthday to me

18
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,340
I go down on my knees to you.

19
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,780
How do you feel about 42?

20
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,330
- 42 what?
- Mm.

21
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,990
You know. Years.

22
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,710
It depends. How do you feel?

23
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,500
- I feel betrayed.
- Ohh.

24
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,340
Really?

25
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,800
Well....

26
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,010
You know...

27
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,350
...they say...

28
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,390
...you know who "they" are...

29
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,060
...that life begins at 40.

30
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,850
I spent the last...

31
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,400
...2 years...

32
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,740
...realizing they'd been
lying in their teeth.

33
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,030
I don't know. I think the last 2 years
have been rather good.

34
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,160
That's because you're 38.

35
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,450
- Keep your voice down.
- Ohh.

36
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,880
- Goodnight, George.
- Mm.

37
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,130
- Good night, Sam.
- Night, Sheila.

38
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,960
Night, Sheil.

39
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,840
Sam...

40
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,390
...I want you to promise me something.

41
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,100
Never!

42
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,150
Never throw me
a surprise party again.

43
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,950
- You're welcome.
- Oh, you know what I mean.

44
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,780
I'm going to fill out my night.

45
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,130
Could I have some more white wine,
Bacchus, my dear?

46
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,420
How you feeling, birthday boy?

47
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,050
Oh. Invalided.

48
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,300
You mean invalid?

49
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,010
I'm... Well, that, too...

50
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,310
...but I feel basically invalided,
like an invalid.

51
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,480
Remember what they say, George.
After 40, it's all patch, patch, patch.

52
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,110
Ugh. I'm going home.

53
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,780
- We're working here in the morning.
- Oh, goody, goody.

54
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,170
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

55
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,050
- How you doing?
- It's good to see you.

56
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,210
- How's the water?
- Great.

57
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,730
Oh. Thanks, Covington. Thanks.

58
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,320
Happily

59
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,070
Oh, baby, won't you and me

60
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,450
We had it made

61
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,160
Here, try this.

62
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,960
Put this in front of
"don't call it love."

63
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,460
- Oh, in front.
- Right. Try it.

64
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,840
If they ask you

65
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,180
You can say that
We ended happily

66
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,760
- And then have...
- Right.

67
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,260
But don't call it love

68
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,930
When you're talking to me

69
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,230
Great.

70
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,100
If they ask you

71
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,190
You can say that
We ended happily

72
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,030
But don't call it love

73
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,490
When you're talking to me

74
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,530
- Great. Yeah.
- Got it?

75
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,590
- I'm going home.
- Right.

76
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,590
How's Sam?

77
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,220
Oh. Sam's great.

78
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,270
Sam's mostly always great.

79
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,890
Can I have my jacket, please?

80
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,060
That sounds mostly intellectual,
not emotional.

81
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,730
I guess so.

82
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,610
I guess she'd be happier
if things were more emotional.

83
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,700
- I guess so would you.
- Ho-ho-ho.

84
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,160
For a man who's
never been analyzed...

85
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,910
I'd analyze you better
than that expensive shrink.

86
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,330
But you'd come out gay
and I couldn't do that to Sam.

87
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,580
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

88
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,080
- I'll give her your love.
- No. Give her yours.

89
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,950
He's no more than a man

90
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,460
Nothing special that you'd run to see

91
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,380
He's a child to be sure
At times insecure

92
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,590
But he pleases me

93
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,600
For when I'm in his arms

94
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,690
And the last little star slowly dies

95
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,030
I'm enchanted to be

96
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,360
The me that I see in his eyes

97
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,130
He's a man, nothing more

98
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,510
Sort of clumsy and absent of mind

99
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:43,140
Not the kind of a beau
I dreamed long ago

100
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,690
That I would find

101
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,770
He's my lover, my friend

102
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,410
What more could I ask him to be?

103
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,950
So in our little plot

104
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,540
The mystery is what he sees in me

105
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,380
Why is it I never doubt him

106
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,760
When I've known all along

107
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,720
Now and then

108
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:31,900
The very best of men must roam

109
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,400
Sure, I get lonely without him

110
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,490
But a man, right or wrong

111
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,080
The more you bind him

112
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,380
The less you find him home

113
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,010
He's no more than a man

114
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,270
Just a weaver of wishes and dreams

115
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,690
Very shy, insecure

116
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,940
He's a child...

117
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,280
Oh, shit!

118
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,540
- Hi.
- Hi.

119
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,420
- Are you hurt?
- No.

120
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,290
Would you mind stepping out?

121
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,140
- Do you have a license?
- Yeah.

122
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,810
Thank you.

123
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,110
Did you know
your license had expired?

124
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,400
- What?
- July 26.

125
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,320
Oh, no!

126
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,070
Yeah. Uh....

127
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,910
Do you have a registration?

128
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,990
- For the car.
- Um....

129
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,120
Yeah, sure.

130
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,370
Expired license, no registration...

131
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,790
...and reckless driving.

132
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,420
I think you'll need a lawyer to help you
with this one, Mr. Webber.

133
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,920
Yeah.

134
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,630
- See if you can get this thing started.
- Yeah. Thank you.

135
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,910
Go on, move it!

136
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,420
Marriage is a sacred commitment...

137
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,970
...designed on earth,
sanctified in heaven.

138
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,400
Consider these two rings.

139
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,950
Perfect circles...

140
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,620
...without beginning, without end...

141
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,120
...signifying God's eternal love
and devotion.

142
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,710
Where would we be without God's love?

143
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,790
One of the most glorious
of God's institutions...

144
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,670
...is the institution of marriage.

145
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,220
A union of two souls
swearing allegiance...

146
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,720
...and promising in God's name
to obey one another...

147
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,810
...until death do them part.

148
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,980
In today's world...

149
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,810
...it does well to consider
such a commitment.

150
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,820
For in the final analysis,
on the day of reckoning...

151
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,490
...we shall all be held to account.

152
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,990
The time has come
for David and Jenny...

153
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,160
...to make this commitment
to one another.

154
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,660
Do you, David, take Jennifer...

155
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,710
...as your lawful wedded wife...

156
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,750
...to have and to hold...

157
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,170
...in sickness and in health...

158
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,090
...from this day forward
till death do you part?

159
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,760
Ahh! Shit!

160
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,130
Hello!

161
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,560
Hi.

162
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,220
- Whose car?
- What?

163
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,440
- Whose car?
- It's a loaner.

164
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,440
- Jesus, George!
- Don't look.

165
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,730
What have you done to your nose?

166
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,780
A bee flew in the car.

167
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,240
My God! You're lucky
you didn't have a wreck.

168
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,280
- I did have a wreck. I hit a police car.
- A police car?

169
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,160
Yes. And not just a police car.
A Beverly Hills police car.

170
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,910
- My God. Does it hurt?
- You bet your knickers it hurts.

171
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,080
Have you taken anything for it?

172
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,840
Four of your birth control pills.
I hope that's all right.

173
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,420
Try an antihistamine.

174
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,760
I don't like those.
They make me pregnant.

175
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,930
I'll start dinner.

176
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,760
Thank God for that.

177
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,950
Okay, what's up?

178
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,490
What do you mean?

179
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,620
I've been getting
strange vibrations.

180
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,710
Probably just a temporary...

181
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,000
...malfunction of my
biorhythms, dear.

182
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,500
Maybe you are allergic.

183
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,630
That bee sting's awfully close
to your frontal lobes.

184
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,680
Sit down. You'll just
screw things up in the kitchen.

185
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,010
- Go play the piano.
- I want to do my share.

186
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,100
- You shall, darling. Later.
- Ohh. Yeah!

187
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,520
Unbelievable.

188
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,700
Un-fucking-believable.

189
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,550
- Does that guy have a telescope too?
- Yeah.

190
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,970
- See anything interesting?
- Oh, yeah!

191
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,520
Hi, Sam!

192
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,020
Shit! She did it again.

193
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,570
The latest hike in OPEC oil...

194
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,650
That son of a bitch
has a bigger telescope than we have.

195
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,110
Not "we" have, "you" have.

196
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,070
I don't peep into somebody
else's windows to get my jollies.

197
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
You and your friend
are dirty old men.

198
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,700
He's not my friend.

199
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,080
He should be.
You know him intimately now.

200
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,460
I don't watch him, I watch his broads.
He's got a hell of a stable.

201
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,590
He must be good in the sack.

202
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,260
What's that got to do with it?

203
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,470
Unless he has a new
remote control screwing device...

204
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,840
...how can you keep
from watching him too?

205
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
I concentrate on the broads.

206
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,970
- He's around, isn't he?
- Why are you so heat up?

207
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,440
You got the time or you want
to wait till after the late show?

208
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,980
First, I'm getting a little fed up...

209
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,490
...at sexually emancipated ladies
being referred to as "broads."

210
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,740
Second...

211
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,160
...I think a telescope aimed
at anything other than stars...

212
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,830
...is an invasion of privacy and
qualifies the voyeur as a peeping Tom.

213
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,380
And there's a very good law
against that.

214
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,630
Third, the first two
wouldn't bother me a bit...

215
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,300
...if you'd stop watching
so much television...

216
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,800
...and pay attention
to your bedroom guests.

217
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,970
This guest, in particular.

218
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,930
Now, you want to argue
or you want to make love?

219
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,310
Define "broad."

220
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,820
- Your definition or mine?
- I know yours.

221
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,650
A girl who screws around a lot.

222
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,860
- A hooker.
- A hooker's a hooker.

223
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,570
Their spreading their legs
doesn't make the terms interchangeable.

224
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,700
- What's the difference?
- A hooker sells it.

225
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,000
So does a broad.
A hooker makes the price going in.

226
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,170
Ahh. So by definition a broad
is less virtuous than a hooker.

227
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,000
As far as I'm concerned,
virtue has nothing to do with it.

228
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,340
As far as you or any man is concerned,
virtue has everything to do with it.

229
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,970
Listen, I just said "broad."

230
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,720
You applied a disparaging connotation
to the term.

231
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,060
Come on. Are you trying to tell me...

232
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,850
...that "broad" is not a term
used by men...

233
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,190
- ...to describe women disparagingly?
- I'm just saying I didn't use it that way.

234
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,900
- Would you call me a broad?
- That depends.

235
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,740
On whether you watched me
through a telescope...

236
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,700
...while I fooled around
with your degenerate neighbor.

237
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,120
Okay, you define it.

238
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,120
First and foremost, I don't equate
the term exclusively with sex...

239
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,880
...voyeurism or, quote,
"degeneracy."

240
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,550
- You do that.
- So do you, but you won't admit it.

241
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,220
"Broad" to me is just another
colloquial term for "woman"!

242
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,470
Like "dame," "skirt"...

243
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,260
- "Moll."
- "Crumpet." "Moll."

244
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,470
I'm sure Dillinger never used
that word derogatorily.

245
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,400
For authority on female aggrandizement
consult the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List.

246
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,060
Let's look it up.

247
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,150
I want your definition, not Webster's.

248
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,150
I'm going to get
Monsieur Roget's definition.

249
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,740
You know my definition.

250
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,120
"Broad" means woman. Not good,
not bad, unless so designated.

251
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,620
You said a broad does it for money.

252
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,620
You said a hooker sells it.
I said so does a broad.

253
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,960
If a broad is a woman,
then women screw for money?

254
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,000
- Some women!
- Broads!

255
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:07,590
Some broads do it for other things,
but in a way, they sell it!

256
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,680
"Woman - dame, hen, petticoat."

257
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,770
"Slang or derogatory. Jane, broad."

258
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,440
Look. "Slang. Derogatory. Broad."

259
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,810
Okay? How about that, smartass?

260
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,150
You want to look up "derogatory?"

261
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,280
George....

262
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,160
Don't be a shitheel.

263
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,500
Whatever Monsieur Roget's
définition was...

264
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,800
...I was not using the term
in a derogatory fashion!

265
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,340
Some of my oldest and
dearest friends are broads!

266
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,340
- Including your mother.
- You bet!

267
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,680
I want a broad...

268
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,680
My maternal grandmother was one
of the greatest broads that ever lived.

269
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,810
They don't make "broads"
like that anymore.

270
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,070
- You know what's wrong with you?
- Male chauvinist pig.

271
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,440
Besides that.

272
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,240
You're gutless. You're afraid to admit
you blew it, and lose like a man.

273
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,660
I wouldn't mind losing
like a man...

274
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,160
...if you weren't so damned
determined to win like one!

275
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,210
Oh, Christ.

276
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,800
I've got an early call.

277
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,180
Um.... Care to translate that?

278
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,100
Yup. It's getting late.
I think I'd better go.

279
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,390
From Hollywood, The Tonight Show...

280
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,060
...starring Johnny Carson.

281
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,400
This is Ed McMahon,
along with Doc Severinsen...

282
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,530
...and the NBC Orchestra,
inviting you...

283
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,650
...to join Johnny and his guest
Cloris Leachman.

284
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,370
From the Metropolitan Opera company,
Judith Blegen....

285
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,540
I thought we were
going to make love.

286
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,540
It'll cost you 50 bucks and an apology.

287
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,500
Here's Johnny!

288
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,740
Sam!

289
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,250
Oh, damn!

290
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,590
Oh, bollocks!

291
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,430
Ow.

292
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,980
God.

293
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,750
Oh, God.

294
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,800
I give my heart

295
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,390
Just to one man

296
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,980
Loving...

297
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,980
I can't hear you, Fraser.

298
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,690
This too I swear

299
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,320
While I am there

300
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,120
- It's too soon.
- Keep going.

301
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,040
Didn't we have more tables
in San Francisco?

302
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,330
More tables, you know. Never mind.

303
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,380
I give my heart

304
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,630
I know my man

305
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,170
Hold it. You must spend
more time at the tables.

306
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,510
Did we have more tables
in San Francisco?

307
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,760
We did, but...

308
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,930
- Do you mind if I make a phone call?
- Go ahead.

309
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,890
Give everybody a 10, would you?

310
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,850
Okay. Everybody take 10, please.

311
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,530
Stage phone, please.

312
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,400
Sorry, that line's busy.

313
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,040
- Still busy.
- I'll hold.

314
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,090
Okay, over here!

315
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,890
Still busy.

316
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,480
Okay, thank you.

317
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,630
Does he do anything except
swim and jog on the beach?

318
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,250
Oh, yes.

319
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,260
He makes me happy, so I let him
swim and jog on the beach.

320
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,600
The more you do for him,
the more he rubs your nose in it.

321
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,350
Speaking of noses, why don't you keep
yours out of my personal affairs?

322
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,610
In return, I won't bring up that you've
acted like a spoiled child all morning.

323
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,280
I'm going to the market.
Anybody want anything?

324
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,110
No, but bring back the receipts.

325
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
George thinks you
take advantage of me.

326
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,790
Is that so?
Well, I suppose I do.

327
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,750
But then, nobody's perfect.

328
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,160
Oh, George is.

329
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,210
What a drag.

330
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Hugh, sometimes you really are
a pain-in-the-ass fag.

331
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,880
Coming from one of the great
Anglo-Saxon heterosexual...

332
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,100
...bores of all time,
that's the ultimate compliment.

333
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,680
You've brooded and sulked
around my house all morning...

334
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,520
...without the good manners to explain
or apologize, and I'm fed up.

335
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,520
So you know what I'll do?
I'll call it a day.

336
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,110
I'll invite some company over
to soak up the strain.

337
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Some happy, conversational...

338
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,240
...intellectually stimulating,
pleasant company.

339
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,030
The Malibu chapter
of the Sugar Plum Fairies?

340
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,250
As you don't qualify, you understand
why I don't ask you to stay.

341
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,420
I couldn't. I forgot my tutu.

342
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,590
Yeah, see you later, Butch.

343
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,940
- I won't be long.
- Don't be.

344
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,230
What does that mean?

345
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,610
It means go to the store
and come back.

346
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,400
Don't hang around
with your friends at the beach!

347
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,950
Don't get heavy with me.

348
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,240
I'll be back when I'm ready.

349
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,750
What were your thoughts
at the moment of this fixation?

350
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,800
That she was the most beautiful girl
I had ever seen.

351
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,130
Uh, on a scale from 1 to 10?

352
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,300
11.

353
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,470
You said there was
no such thing as a 10.

354
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,680
There's nothing unusual.

355
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,850
I was sitting at the stop sign.

356
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,150
I wasn't thinking anything special.

357
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,860
Suddenly there she was.
And I reacted.

358
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,360
I mean, I wasn't expecting
to see that vision.

359
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,700
What about the young girls
on the beach? And Larry?

360
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,530
I don't like...

361
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,660
...middle age.

362
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,500
I mean, it's not that complicated.
I'd just rather be 30.

363
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,590
Or 20, even.

364
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,920
God. If to make it, I had to
change places with Larry...

365
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,050
...and a life of faggotry...

366
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,260
...I'd sure as hell
give it consideration.

367
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,850
You don't consider that significant?

368
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,270
I'm just using an extreme example
to make a point.

369
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,900
If you could, wouldn't you
change places with Larry?

370
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,190
But I can't!

371
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,780
Didn't you ever
play games like that?

372
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,410
But not to the point
where I got all hung up with it.

373
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,950
You're becoming obsessed
with the ugliness of old age.

374
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,620
The fear of death.
The inevitability of it.

375
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,630
You'd change places
with a homosexual to put it off.

376
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,460
So what do you do?

377
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,210
You play it safe.

378
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,800
You get a fixation
on a beautiful young girl.

379
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,640
A "vision," I think
was your description.

380
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,310
And I suspect,
for your total vision...

381
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,150
Yes?

382
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,440
Um, excuse me, reverend,
I was just driving by your church...

383
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,160
...and, uh, a thought struck me.

384
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,280
If it wouldn't be an imposition...

385
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,290
...and you could spare a few minutes,
I'd be eternally grateful.

386
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
By George!

387
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,540
Aren't you George...?

388
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,250
- Webber.
- Of course!

389
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,920
George Webber!

390
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,090
My goodness!

391
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,170
Well, come on in, George!

392
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,760
- Thank you.
- How wonderful!

393
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,680
You know, George,
I'm a songwriter too.

394
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,350
When you are near

395
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,770
Though we're under a cloud

396
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,690
Why do I hear

397
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,820
Rainbows that shine out loud

398
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,870
Why is there music

399
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,540
When I'm kissing your glove

400
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,250
Could it be

401
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,300
That I have an ear for love

402
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,340
Why, when you smile

403
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,340
Do those bells ding-a-ling

404
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,390
Turning my heart

405
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,560
Into a thumping thing

406
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,400
Glee clubs of moonbeams

407
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,860
Sing your name in the blue

408
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,160
When I hold you near My love

409
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,790
Look into my ear My love

410
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,750
You'll see that what I say I hear

411
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,250
My love

412
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,090
Is true

413
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,010
Well?

414
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,640
Well...

415
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,220
Now, George, you must be
absolutely frank with me.

416
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,890
Yes. Well, frankly, I....

417
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,150
- I'm stunned.
- Do you think it's professional?

418
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,070
I think it's amazing.

419
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,780
You realize, I've loved music all my life.

420
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,110
Excuse us, Mrs. Kissel.

421
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,160
Loved it all my life.
Of course, I made a choice.

422
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:41,450
I'm not dissatisfied.
I took the right road.

423
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,200
- I think you did.
- But the music, you know.

424
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,290
- Always there, right?
- Oh, yes, yes.

425
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,460
Sometimes, though,
it gets to be almost too much.

426
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,300
I feel like chucking everything,
and just write, write.

427
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,680
Yes. Well, I think you should
stick with it, reverend.

428
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,140
You really did like it.

429
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,810
No. He that hath clean hands
and a pure heart...

430
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,190
...who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity....

431
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,110
Yes, yes. Quite.

432
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,290
All right,
Mrs. Kissel, we'll take care of it.

433
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,620
- She's been with me for ages.
- Yes.

434
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,580
It's all right.
You go on back to the kitchen now.

435
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,340
No damage done.

436
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,710
How old is she?

437
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,720
I honestly don't know.
I don't think she does.

438
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,350
Whenever Mrs. Kissel breaks wind,
we beat the dog.

439
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:57,440
I mean, the whole depersonalized lifestyle
that puts down anything traditional...

440
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,160
...and completely ignores many of our...

441
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,620
...socially most fundamental institutions.

442
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,490
Such as marriage, for instance.

443
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,460
Right on, George. Heh-heh-heh.

444
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,040
I think I'm fairly well
psychologically oriented.

445
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,380
I've talked to psychologists,
psychiatrists...

446
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,380
...welfare workers....

447
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,510
But when I drove by your church
today, I thought, "God!"

448
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,010
Goodness...

449
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,760
...who better than somebody
who truly represents...

450
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,730
"...the institution of marriage
and all it stands for?"

451
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,640
I'd be more than happy to help.

452
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,560
That's really marvelous.

453
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,690
Well, for instance,
compared to, say, 5 or 10...

454
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,320
You may not believe it...

455
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,070
...but just as many young people
are marrying today...

456
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,860
- ...as they were 10 years ago.
- Really?

457
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,410
Of course, there's a difference.

458
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,200
It fits right in
with this depersonalized concept.

459
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,920
So many don't seem able to relate
to the true meaning of the ceremony.

460
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,420
Mm. Can you be more specific?
Have you married any young people lately?

461
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,590
Yesterday I married
Jennifer Miles and David Hanley.

462
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,930
Perhaps you might know
the bride's father, Dr. Miles.

463
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,850
He's a very prominent
Beverly Hills dentist.

464
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,720
No. No.

465
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,920
- Theater.
- Stage phone, please.

466
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,500
All I possess is

467
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,550
Get the phone

468
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,340
Hello?

469
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,720
- Samantha Taylor, please.
- She's busy.

470
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,100
God, she's always busy.

471
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,350
My name is George Webber. I'm trying
to get a message to her. Can I do that?

472
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,770
- For Samantha Taylor? Who's calling?
- Right. George Webber.

473
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,570
- Webber.
- Could you spell that?

474
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,490
W-E-B-B-E-R.

475
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,160
- Got it.
- Hello? Hello?

476
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,450
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. If you could just tell her...

477
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,910
Hello? Oh, dammit!

478
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,360
Oh, God!

479
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,020
You have all the... Ohh!

480
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,540
Ahh! Shit! God!

481
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,710
Dammit. Ow!

482
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,380
Hey, I see him!

483
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,050
What's he doing?

484
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,590
Come on, George!

485
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,910
- Oh!
- Hello?

486
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,120
Hello!

487
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,130
I didn't want to bother you
but I'm leaving town tomorrow.

488
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,140
How long since you've had
your teeth checked?

489
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,430
God, I don't know. Uh....

490
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,480
My dentist is Dr. Shoup in New York.
Do you know him?

491
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,440
- No. Don't believe I do.
- Oh.

492
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,860
Open, please.

493
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,160
- Ahh!
- Shh.

494
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,790
How long since you've seen Dr. Shoup?

495
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,200
Couple of years.

496
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,960
- You've got six cavities.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

497
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,870
- Two of them are pretty bad.
- Really.

498
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:07,130
- Six cavities?
- This is the worst. See this shadow?

499
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,420
That's the nerve.
Lucky if we can save this tooth.

500
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,260
Oh. What?

501
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,430
- Who are my next appointments?
- Mrs. Phillips and Mr. Rodinsky.

502
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,180
Now open as wide
as you can, please. Wide. Wide.

503
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,520
See if you can cancel them.

504
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,320
And tell Janie that we may have
to work through the lunch hour.

505
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,860
You have to do them all now?
Couldn't we just do the bad ones?

506
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,790
Well, they're all bad. Two of them
really serious. But they're all bad.

507
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:43,330
Look, I can cancel my vacation
for a few days...

508
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,500
I'm afraid that wouldn't help very much.

509
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,340
In an emergency,
I can shift things around a bit.

510
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,510
But otherwise I'm booked solid
for the next month.

511
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,300
No, I think under the circumstances...

512
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,720
...better we just get it over with.
It won't be so bad.

513
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,020
Then you can take your vacation,
and as far as your teeth are concerned...

514
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,730
...you can relax and enjoy yourself.

515
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,900
- Beginning to feel the Novocaine?
- Yeah. My lips are tingling.

516
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,030
I enjoy your music.

517
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,250
The last time I was in New York,
Mrs. Miles and I saw, uh...

518
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,830
...Dream Boat!
That was your show, wasn't it?

519
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,080
- Uh.
- Ha-ha-ha!

520
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,460
It was '67. '68.

521
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,380
- '68.
- '68.

522
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,760
That was a hell of a good show.

523
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,140
- That hurt?
- Not really.

524
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,600
Where are you going
on your vacation?

525
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,940
The Virgin Islands.

526
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,270
Mrs. Miles and I always go to Mexico.

527
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,740
- Oh.
- Las Hadas.

528
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,610
Lava tus dientes.

529
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,030
That's Spanish for "brush your teeth."

530
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,450
It's really terrific.

531
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,790
My daughter Jenny's there now
on her honeymoon.

532
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,310
- How are you?
- Not very well.

533
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,650
Pardon?

534
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,110
- This'll take a few minutes.
- Okay.

535
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,320
- Sir?
- Forget it.

536
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,990
Sure.

537
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,210
Hi, Mr. Webber.

538
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,880
Huh?

539
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:01,470
Cup of coffee. Black coffee.

540
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,930
- Oh, coffee.
- Coffee.

541
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,930
That's all right.

542
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,460
Thank you.

543
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,690
Oh, Christ.

544
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,570
Hello?

545
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,990
- Hello?
- Who is this?

546
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,210
Is this 275-0817?

547
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,250
Yeah, yeah, it's George.

548
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,840
Ohh!

549
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Hello?

550
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,640
Operator.

551
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,640
Operator, I'm having trouble
reaching 275-0817.

552
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,060
Could you try it, please?

553
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,100
Ohh.

554
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,120
Hello?

555
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,660
Hello?

556
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,250
- Operator.
- Would you get me the police?

557
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,180
- Josh?
- Yeah?

558
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,100
- I'm going out. I'll be back.
- Okay.

559
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,020
- Do your homework.
- I've already done it!

560
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,650
Oh, what?

561
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,590
What is this?
What's wrong? What's wrong?

562
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,510
- Pardon?
- What's wrong? What are you doing here?

563
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,300
We got a call from a Miss Taylor.

564
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,390
She spoke to this house.
A strange man answered.

565
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,430
He spoke gibberish,
made obscene sounds.

566
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,770
She was afraid Mr. Webber,
the tenant...

567
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,610
- That's me!
- ...met with foul play.

568
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,290
The prescription's for G. Webber.

569
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,330
Do you know Mr. Webber?

570
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,760
He wants to write something.

571
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,360
"My name is George Webber."

572
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,160
I just came from the dentist
where I had 6 cavities filled.

573
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,750
"I have identification in the house."

574
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,370
Six?

575
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,630
You better take it easy.
Pain pills and alcohol don't mix.

576
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,380
You could've fooled me.

577
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,390
Oh, George! With the...

578
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,020
Come in. Step right in.

579
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,740
George?

580
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,530
George?

581
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,120
You go for it, George!

582
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,250
- Are you going for it?
- I'm going for it.

583
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,540
Oh, God! Anything.

584
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,940
I want to say something.

585
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,480
- I have a telescope.
- You do?

586
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,490
I look at him every day
and he looks at me.

587
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,780
I don't think I've been
so happy for years.

588
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,370
Come have a walk with me.

589
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:42,300
You miserable little son of a bitch!

590
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,330
- Yup?
- Sam?

591
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,120
Yep!

592
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,580
Oh!

593
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,750
Oh, fuck! Uh.

594
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,980
Hello?

595
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,110
Aeromexico.

596
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,040
Oh!

597
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,310
Damn you, George!

598
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,630
Ow!

599
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,330
- George Webber.
- Would you please sign in?

600
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,140
Mr. Webber?

601
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,600
Buenos Dias.

602
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,940
I'm Vicente, the assistant manager.

603
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,980
Welcome to Las Hadas.

604
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,570
Oh.

605
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,700
Is that for me?

606
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,410
It's a custom here
at Las Hadas. It'll keep you cool.

607
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:41,120
- Can I drink on the way to the room?
- Of course.

608
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,460
We've got a very beautiful place here.

609
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,880
Look out!

610
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:04,350
I hope the maid has made up
the room. Good, she did.

611
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,810
Mr. Webber?

612
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,520
- Mr. Webber.
- Huh?

613
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,400
Right this way.

614
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,650
Mr. Webber, right this way.

615
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,280
- You must have had a rough flight.
- Huh?

616
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,450
- I said you must have had a rough flight.
- Nyeh.

617
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,710
These rooms are well-insulated.

618
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,040
You'll have peace and quiet.

619
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,750
And also, as I said...

620
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,590
...the view from the balcony
is magnificent.

621
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,350
Mr. Webber?

622
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:42,020
Mr. Webber?

623
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,590
- Hugh?
- Hm?

624
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,760
What is it about that miserable little
son of a bitch that makes me care?

625
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,850
- Well...
- I don't want to, you know.

626
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:24,390
He's more trouble than any man
I've ever known, including my ex-husband.

627
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,650
Apart from being uncommonly bright,
wonderfully witty...

628
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,730
...generous, occasionally lovable
and a genius...

629
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,230
...I can't think of a single thing.

630
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,650
- How about unnaturally belligerent?
- Oh, yes.

631
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,070
- Exhaustingly childish?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

632
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,740
We've nothing in common.

633
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,870
We're the original odd couple.

634
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,920
And when he really gets me going...

635
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,590
...I can't ask him to step outside
because he's too small.

636
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,590
I hope he's gone for good.

637
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
Well, he hasn't.

638
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,390
- He's going through male menopause.
- Come on.

639
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,640
All right.
Ladies have a biological edge...

640
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:10,310
...but most males over 40 make up for it
in the emotional department.

641
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,360
He's gone. I don't know where he is.

642
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,980
Nothing has happened to him.
Nothing sinister, that is.

643
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,780
It'll take him a while to find out
he's a certified imbecile.

644
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:24,160
He'll come home, tail between his legs
and settle down for good.

645
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,120
Lest ye judge harshly, remember....

646
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,170
- Nobody's perfect.
- Thank God.

647
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:36,170
Anyway, I'd still like to punch him
right in the mouth.

648
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,680
Buenos Dias.

649
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,730
A very good evening to you.

650
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,360
Oh. I'd like strong black coffee
and some amphetamines.

651
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,030
Might I suggest the dining room?

652
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,900
And the local pusher.

653
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,240
In whatever order you
consider appropriate.

654
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,240
Yes, yes.

655
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,280
I'll settle for a brandy.

656
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,080
- Thanks.
- Certainly.

657
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,170
Cheers.

658
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:14,310
I think, one more time, basically.

659
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,070
If you still want coffee...

660
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,610
I've survived the crisis, thank you.

661
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,280
- Is there a phone I can use?
- Sure.

662
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,780
- Dial "9."
- Mm.

663
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,120
Thank you.

664
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,620
- Operator.
- Mm.

665
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,130
Hello, this is Mr. George Webber.

666
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,630
I'm in room....

667
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,210
I don't know what room I'm in.
Do you know?

668
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:45,470
- Yes. 104.
- Thank God. Thank you.

669
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:48,600
Could you do me a favor and get me...

670
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,930
...area code 213...

671
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,640
...655-2264?

672
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,850
Miss Samantha Taylor.

673
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:01,020
- Miss Samantha Taylor?
- Right. Thank you.

674
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,830
By what name are you known, sir?

675
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,330
I'm known by the name of "Donald."

676
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,750
"Don," to my friends
and paying customers.

677
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,960
In that case...

678
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,630
...another double, Don.

679
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,380
"Double Don."
That'll be hard to say...

680
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,510
...by the shank of the evening.

681
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,340
Better make that a single.

682
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:39,560
Hello? Yes.

683
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,110
- Sam!
- George?

684
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,610
Yes. Listen, you'll never guess
in a million years.

685
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:47,490
I'm in Mexico.

686
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,490
And I'm sitting in...

687
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,370
...the Las Hadas bar...

688
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,200
...having a brandy
with my old friend, Don.

689
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:57,460
- Say hello to Sam, Don.
- Hello, Sam.

690
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:01,000
Listen, I tried to call you
a dozen times.

691
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,380
When do you plan on coming back?

692
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,300
Hello? George?

693
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,180
Darling...

694
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,930
...I won't stay...

695
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:18,140
...a minute longer than I have to.

696
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,020
Just a couple of days...

697
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:23,570
...a couple of weeks.
I should have it all sorted out.

698
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,690
I love you too much...

699
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,070
...to put you through
all that rubbish.

700
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,860
I need... Ahem.

701
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:33,410
I need the time to be alone.

702
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,790
Okay?

703
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:39,960
Sam? Sam?

704
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,210
- Mm-hm?
- Say something.

705
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,880
Piss off, George!

706
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,190
They don't write music
like that anymore.

707
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:06,020
Well, not much anymore, anyway.

708
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,980
Is that good or bad?

709
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,950
What do you think?

710
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,370
I'm opposed to bartenders making
value judgments while on duty.

711
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:18,790
- For that matter, so is the management.
- Oh, poo-poo.

712
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,790
How old are you?

713
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,710
Thirty-seven. But I look 40.

714
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,840
No. You look 33.

715
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,800
That's because I'm really 25.

716
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:39,350
We are each of us
the product of an era.

717
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,600
That music is my era.

718
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,230
Beautiful melody.

719
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,780
Great lyric.

720
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,030
If you were 19...

721
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:59,950
...and 20 years from now...

722
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:04,920
...you were dancing with your wife...

723
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,380
...or girlfriend you knew
in high school...

724
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,510
...and you said to her, "Darling..."

725
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,010
...they're playing our song"...

726
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,680
...do you know what they'd be playing?

727
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:20,850
"Why Don't We Do It In the Road?"

728
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:24,690
What the fucking hell
kind of era is that?

729
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,820
- To each his own.
- Ah. Now that's a good song.

730
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:53,630
What...

731
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:58,260
What is the sum total
of my indebtedness...

732
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,060
...to this establishment?

733
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,770
Name and room number.

734
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,860
Uh....

735
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:17,320
I have left something
for your favorite charity.

736
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,370
- That's me.
- Why not?

737
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,660
- Good night, Don.
- Good night.

738
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:23,500
Mr. Webber....

739
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,790
And for what it's worth...

740
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,210
...I like your songs.

741
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,460
God.

742
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,470
Well....

743
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:42,180
You know something?
You suddenly don't look a day over 30.

744
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:25,180
Oh, oh.

745
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,440
Oh, Sam.

746
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,810
Come and save me, for chrissake.

747
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:47,370
- Hello?
- Josh.

748
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,120
- Yeah.
- Hi, it's George.

749
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:51,000
- How are you?
- Okay.

750
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:52,830
Let me speak to your mother.

751
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,590
She doesn't want to talk to you.

752
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,090
What do you mean?

753
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,930
Young man, go and tell her
I'm on the phone, right now!

754
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,720
Piss off, George!

755
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,330
I couldn't sleep.

756
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,710
- It's the brandy.
- Yeah.

757
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,710
- Let's get back to the doubles.
- How will that help you sleep?

758
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,880
I said I couldn't.
I didn't say I wanted to.

759
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:44,340
Live and learn, like I always say.

760
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:46,260
Oh, God.

761
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,970
What else do you always say?

762
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,930
I always say...

763
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,350
...down the hatch.

764
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,560
Ho, ho. Oh.

765
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,570
Up the rebels.

766
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,450
Hello.

767
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:14,370
Hello.

768
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,670
I don't mean to be rude,
but aren't you George Webber?

769
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:25,760
Yes, I am, and I don't think
you're being the teeniest bit rude.

770
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:27,890
Terrific.

771
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,680
I met you at Truman Capote's party.

772
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:36,600
- Terrific.
- My name is Mary Lewis.

773
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,440
- Congratulations, Mary Lewis.
- Thank you. Thank you.

774
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,580
Enid. Enid, darling. Have you met my wife?

775
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:52,000
I'm so pissed.

776
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:56,460
- She's lost her shape.
- She's going to enjoy this.

777
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,590
Nice room you have. Pretty.

778
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,590
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

779
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,170
I'm sorry.

780
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:07,680
Let me make it well.

781
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,230
I don't want you to be afraid.

782
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,660
George.

783
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,210
Hmm?

784
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:39,080
Is it me?

785
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,340
No.

786
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:44,840
Yes, it is.

787
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,090
Okay.

788
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,050
- Is it?
- No.

789
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,980
It is me, isn't it?

790
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,390
No.

791
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,610
This ever happen to you before?

792
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:09,990
Well, it's happened to me before.

793
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,040
Ta-da. Heh-heh-heh.

794
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,790
There was this...

795
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,800
...beautiful guy. Willis.

796
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,460
- Willis...
- Ackerman.

797
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,680
Willis Ackerman.

798
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:33,850
We slept together,
by actual count, 16 times.

799
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,560
No matter what we did or how,
he just couldn't manage.

800
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,900
That's terrible.

801
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:47,900
One time he got so crazy,
he just started punching the wall.

802
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,280
Hit it as hard as he could.

803
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,740
Broke the old hand in three places.

804
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,750
He swore he loved me.

805
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,290
He'd sit on that bed in the dark
and he would cry like a baby.

806
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:08,340
It never happened to him before,
he said.

807
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:13,010
We stopped seeing each other finally.

808
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:16,970
You know, he's got three kids now.

809
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:20,980
He's married
and he's got 3 kids in 4 years.

810
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,270
I think he's...

811
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:26,570
...worked his problem out.

812
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:32,030
Yeah, well, I was his problem
and he sure worked me right out.

813
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,620
So don't go punching any walls,
Georgie, huh?

814
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,290
Some of us...

815
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,550
...just don't bring out
the man in men.

816
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:52,430
Good night, sweet Georgie.

817
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:17,200
The sand is hot! Oh! Ah! Hot!

818
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:20,410
Oh, God.

819
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,130
The sand is hot.

820
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,520
God, bloody hell.

821
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:50,900
- Oh! Ha, ha.
- Sorry.

822
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,830
Ah! Ahh. Oh, God.

823
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,050
God.

824
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,570
Hello. Drink, sir?

825
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:41,780
Can I get you anything to drink?

826
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:44,120
Something cool, refreshing?

827
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:46,370
Can I soak my feet in it?

828
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:51,250
How about a Bloody Mary? You can stand
in the ocean while drinking it.

829
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,460
God, yeah.
That may be the suggestion of the week.

830
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:56,510
- Thank you.
- Okay.

831
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,810
Oh, God.

832
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:13,650
Think I'll go out
and get a surfboard.

833
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,280
Ow, ow! Damn! Damn!

834
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,240
Ah, fuck it!

835
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:08,040
- Here you go, sir.
- Oh, shit!

836
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,160
Here's your Bloody Mary.

837
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,670
- Would you like to drink it in the ocean?
- No, no.

838
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,380
- It's really warm in the ocean.
- No, no.

839
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,550
- I'll take you on my back. Come on.
- No.

840
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,700
- Okay here, sir?
- Yeah.

841
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:48,700
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

842
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,540
Enjoy yourself.

843
01:16:56,630 --> 01:17:02,550
- He is a very enterprising young man.
- Mm. Yes, yes.

844
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:05,640
I must admit I feel a bit foolish.

845
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,680
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

846
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,190
I didn't get your name.

847
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,400
Webber. George.

848
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,610
- Collins. Bill.
- Hi. How are you?

849
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:26,410
- Switzer. Chuck.
- Hi.

850
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:30,910
Chuck refuses to be carried.

851
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,500
He used to be a Marine.

852
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:37,500
Oh, well. To Tripoli.

853
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:40,340
Semper fi.

854
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,770
I was in the Royal Air Force,
as a matter of fact.

855
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:02,150
I thought you had to be English
to be in that.

856
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,780
You do.

857
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:08,120
- You an English fellow, huh?
- Mm-hm.

858
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,040
That's all right.

859
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:55,930
Sir. Can I get you anything else?

860
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:58,430
Yeah. Terrific.

861
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,100
How about a beer?

862
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:04,150
Uh. No, actually. Thanks.
I think I might go for a swim.

863
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,070
- If you need anything...
- I'll give you a shout.

864
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,670
- Surfboard?
- It's great. Can I get you one?

865
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,710
I've never really used one.

866
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,970
There's nothing to it. No big waves.
Just paddle around.

867
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,470
Sure it's not dangerous?

868
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,060
Absolutely. The hotel's had only
one accident since opening.

869
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:39,180
- That was because the dummy fell asleep.
- Fell asleep?

870
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:42,100
Yeah. He fell asleep on the board...

871
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:45,020
...drifted out to sea
and the currents got him.

872
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:49,690
The currents?

873
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,860
Past the point, there's heavy currents.
6 or 7 knots.

874
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:57,410
If you're on a surfboard or swimming,
that's it. You could end up in Peru.

875
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,290
- You mean he...
- Never found him.

876
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,830
But you don't fall asleep on a surfboard.

877
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:06,960
And you don't paddle out too far.

878
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:10,550
- Well, maybe tomorrow.
- What about sailing?

879
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:14,760
- Great sport.
- Maybe. I'll see you later.

880
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:16,550
Adios.

881
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:08,640
Hey! Hey! Hey!

882
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:17,070
Come on!

883
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:18,990
Oh!

884
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:55,980
Against odds
and without thought for his own safety...

885
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,730
...George Webber, composer,
playwright...

886
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:01,150
...and winner
of four Academy Awards...

887
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,740
...braved treacherous waters
to save a drowning man.

888
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,620
David Hanley, 23,
and his bride, Jennifer...

889
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:11,250
...are honeymooning at
the Las Hadas Hotel in Mexico.

890
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:15,250
David fell asleep on his surfboard
and drifted out to sea.

891
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,460
I've got to call Sam!

892
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:20,590
...told me how dangerous
it is in the currents.

893
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,420
I was out in the boat...

894
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,010
...and I decided...

895
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:27,850
...there wasn't time to go for help,
so I went after him.

896
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,640
Hello? Hello?

897
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:33,690
- George Webber, please.
- One moment please.

898
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:37,440
- To your very good health.
- Thank you, Don.

899
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:38,980
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

900
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,820
- Lounge.
- Mr. Webber, please.

901
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,280
Wait one moment.

902
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,830
- Are you in?
- No, no.

903
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:54,460
Listen, Kitty,
until otherwise instructed...

904
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,380
...Mr. Webber'll be incommunicado.

905
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:00,090
Oh, my God! Where's that?

906
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:03,010
About 20 miles east,
and make a left turn.

907
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,880
Okay. Thank you, Don.

908
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:09,850
Clever girl. She wanted to know
where "communicado" was.

909
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,430
Oh, it's very obvious.

910
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,890
It's a stone's throw from "cognito."

911
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:17,900
Sorry.

912
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:19,440
Sorry.

913
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:28,490
This is the new one, Hugh.

914
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:19,970
That's beautiful.

915
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:23,480
More, Georgie.

916
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:26,020
Play "Funny Valentine."

917
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:30,270
You don't remember?
I played that for you already.

918
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:31,690
You did?

919
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:34,820
At Truman Capote's party.

920
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:37,490
Gosh, I don't remember.

921
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,450
Are you sure?

922
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:45,080
I play it at every party.

923
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,010
Keep a light in the window.
I may be back.

924
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,430
- Right, mate.
- Oh, yes.

925
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:17,950
- Who is it?
- Uh, George Webber.

926
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,700
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were in the shower.

927
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:24,160
Oh, no, no. Come in.

928
01:31:24,370 --> 01:31:26,960
I tried to call,
but you weren't in.

929
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:29,620
I'll just slip into a robe. Come in.

930
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,210
There's a bar if you want a drink.

931
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,880
There's a joint in the ashtray.

932
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:04,410
I didn't get home
from the hospital until 8:00.

933
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,950
How is your husband?

934
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,870
He's got a terrible sunburn.

935
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,210
He'll lie on his stomach for days.

936
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:13,840
It could have been much worse.

937
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:16,840
- Wouldn't you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

938
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:19,420
- Some grass?
- No, no, no.

939
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:23,010
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes.

940
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,930
You know my father.

941
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:30,980
- Yes.
- He says you're his patient.

942
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:33,610
- Dr. Miles, D.D.S.
- That's right.

943
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:36,780
Well, isn't that wild?

944
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:39,740
Yeah.

945
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,490
You wouldn't believe this.

946
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:44,410
About two weeks ago,
David and I saw you on Dinah Shore.

947
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,660
Oh, right.

948
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:49,700
To be honest, I didn't know
who you were or what you did.

949
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:54,380
But I said to David,
"There's a really attractive older man."

950
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,210
Oh. Well, that's nice.

951
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,800
And you've written all those songs.

952
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,180
- A few.
- Elevator music.

953
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:06,300
God! Elevator music.

954
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:10,520
The music in elevators.
Lots of violins.

955
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:13,690
I know what you mean.
I'm very big in elevators.

956
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,200
- And here you are.
- Yeah.

957
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:27,280
You saved my husband's life.

958
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,540
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

959
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:33,000
Yeah, I suppose it is.

960
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,170
Did you know we were
on our honeymoon?

961
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:39,500
- No.
- We were married Friday.

962
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,380
Oh.

963
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:46,050
- Not much of a honeymoon.
- It doesn't matter.

964
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:49,850
We lived together two years.
We only did it for the family.

965
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,520
My father's just right of Attila the Hun.

966
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,820
- May I ask you something, Mr. Webber?
- If you call me George.

967
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:02,490
I haven't eaten all day.

968
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:06,660
Well, in that case
let me take you out to dinner.

969
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:10,200
That's what I was going
to ask you, George.

970
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:07,130
Pretty song.

971
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:13,220
"Esta noche, la Paso contigo."

972
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,600
What does that mean?

973
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:21,230
Tonight I spend with you.

974
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:37,470
Tell me something, sweet Donald.

975
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:42,020
What's fair about a man...

976
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,520
...getting older...

977
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:47,860
...and looking more distinguished
and worldly...

978
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:52,490
...and a woman getting older
and looking old?

979
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,950
There's nothing fair about that.

980
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,250
Yeah.

981
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,440
No, I'm...

982
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:27,770
...just fine.

983
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,950
I wasn't expecting Prokofiev.

984
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:38,200
I saw Romeo and Juliet
at the Royal Opera House...

985
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:41,410
...when I was 16,
with Nureyev and Fonteyn.

986
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,830
It really wiped me out.

987
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:47,670
I like different music
for different things.

988
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:51,210
I like to listen to rock.

989
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:53,170
I like to dance to jazz.

990
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:55,800
What do you do to Prokofiev?

991
01:37:58,510 --> 01:37:59,560
Fuck.

992
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,480
And not only Prokofiev. Ravel.

993
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,990
Did you ever do it to Ravel's "Bolero"?

994
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,900
No.

995
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,670
My uncle turned me on to it.

996
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,250
My stepmother's younger brother.

997
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:36,380
I spent weekends at his house.
I was at school in England.

998
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:41,560
Uncle Fred said "Bolero" was the
most descriptive sex music ever written.

999
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:45,310
And he proved it.

1000
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:18,840
George?

1001
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:20,760
I forgot the joint.

1002
01:39:21,010 --> 01:39:22,180
What, now?

1003
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:31,500
Oh, God, you beautiful thing!

1004
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:34,670
Better hurry or you'll
have to start it again.

1005
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,340
The music.
You'll have to start it again.

1006
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:51,060
- Start it again!
- What?

1007
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:55,480
It's better if you start right
at the beginning. Please?

1008
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:01,150
Hurry!

1009
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:05,200
Oh, shit.

1010
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:17,130
It's all right. It's a long piece.

1011
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:22,880
Oh, God. Oh, Jenny.

1012
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:28,010
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1013
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:35,230
Ah, ah, ah! Ow, my hair!

1014
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,770
Oh, I'm sorry.

1015
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:51,250
- What?
- It's better if I'm on top.

1016
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:53,580
Oh, okay.

1017
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,090
- What?
- A feather!

1018
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,390
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1019
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:11,890
- Maybe it's better if we go the other way.
- Okay.

1020
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:27,740
- Now what?
- It's stuck!

1021
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:29,910
It's not. Really, don't be afraid.

1022
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:32,290
The record is stuck!

1023
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,000
The record!

1024
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:36,710
Oh, Christ.

1025
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,750
Fix it, please!

1026
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,130
Finally.

1027
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,930
- Oh, Jesus!
- I don't believe it!

1028
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,310
Hello?

1029
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:01,230
Oh, hi, baby.
How do you feel?

1030
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:03,530
It's David.

1031
01:43:04,530 --> 01:43:06,820
George Webber.
We went out to dinner.

1032
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,820
George Webber,
the man who saved...

1033
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,700
Right, right.

1034
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:15,160
Hold on. He wants to talk to you.

1035
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:19,750
He wants to thank you.

1036
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:22,630
Hi, David.

1037
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,670
Yeah. Oh, no big deal.

1038
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:29,010
No, it's my pleasure.

1039
01:43:29,390 --> 01:43:31,390
Yeah, she's...

1040
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,180
We had a nice dinner.

1041
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:36,520
And we were just sitting around talking.

1042
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:41,770
I was just getting ready to leave.

1043
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:46,030
Sure will. Okay, nice talking to you.

1044
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:51,570
Hi. You sound like you're
really out of it.

1045
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,530
Beautiful. I envy you.

1046
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:55,160
You'd better get some sleep.

1047
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:57,370
I'll be there about 11:00.

1048
01:43:57,540 --> 01:44:00,040
Okay. All right. Bye.

1049
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:03,500
They just gave him a shot of Demerol.
He's really out of it.

1050
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:05,380
Oh, God.

1051
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:20,190
Oh, fuck! Ow.

1052
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,660
Hold it.

1053
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,710
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1054
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,460
Why me?

1055
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:45,500
What do you mean?

1056
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:49,380
Tonight! Me. This.

1057
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,470
Why not?

1058
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,940
Are you bothered
because my old man called?

1059
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:02,730
God, aren't you?

1060
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:04,150
No.

1061
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:06,900
And what about this?

1062
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,570
- I don't understand.
- Oh, come on.

1063
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:11,400
This! Us!

1064
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:13,070
What about it?

1065
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:15,240
Why the hell get married?

1066
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,620
I got married because I wanted to.

1067
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:25,380
A week later you have an affair with
the man who saved your husband's life!

1068
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:31,220
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, Jenny.

1069
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:32,930
"Oh, wow"?

1070
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:35,590
I don't understand that thinking.

1071
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,430
Well, evidently not.

1072
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:43,230
Five minutes ago
you weren't worried about him.

1073
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,350
- Oh, boy.
- Or whether I was married.

1074
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,770
The hell I wasn't!

1075
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,780
How do you act
when you're not worried?

1076
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:58,240
I thought maybe you thought
I was more than just a casual lay.

1077
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:00,450
Why'd you think that?

1078
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,960
Oh, great. Thank you. Terrific.

1079
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:09,550
Because I thought you were something
different. Something special!

1080
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:13,130
I am. As far as I'm concerned,
I'm very special.

1081
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:16,430
If I sleep with someone,
it's because I want to.

1082
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:19,810
- Mm-hm.
- I enjoy it. It pleases me.

1083
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,470
Jolly good!

1084
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,480
It's okay if your husband does it?

1085
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,060
If it makes him happy.

1086
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:28,440
Nothing wrong with being happy...

1087
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:31,320
...but there's more to life than
screwing to Ravel's "Bolero."

1088
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:32,990
Sure there is.

1089
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:36,070
But what's wrong with screwing
to Ravel's "Bolero"?

1090
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:40,790
It depends why you're doing it
and with whom you're doing it...

1091
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:42,160
...with.

1092
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:44,500
If I thought that much, I'd be a virgin!

1093
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,170
Oh, look, Jenny!

1094
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:48,830
George, are you happy?

1095
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,800
Let me see....

1096
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:56,510
Um.... No.

1097
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:58,680
Not at this minute.

1098
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:00,350
Neither am I.

1099
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:04,520
But I was,
and I intend to be again soon.

1100
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:08,980
I don't know your problem
but you won't solve it by solving mine.

1101
01:47:09,190 --> 01:47:12,530
- Fine.
- And I don't think I really have a problem.

1102
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,070
Mm-hm.

1103
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:16,900
That's your problem.

1104
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,890
- George?
- Hmm?

1105
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:48,390
Would you turn off the record?

1106
01:48:11,330 --> 01:48:16,960
I give my heart

1107
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:24,100
Just to one man

1108
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:30,640
I give my heart

1109
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:35,440
To one man

1110
01:48:36,110 --> 01:48:40,450
Alone

1111
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:58,340
- They loved it.
- At $8.50 a crack, I'm lucky.

1112
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:02,800
- What's up?
- George fucking Webber!

1113
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,820
Hello, Mr. Webber. Come in.

1114
01:49:21,490 --> 01:49:23,160
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

1115
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:26,740
- Is she expecting you?
- No.

1116
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:29,620
- I'd better let her know you're here.
- Okay.

1117
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:35,330
Mrs. Taylor?

1118
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,340
- Yes?
- Mr. Webber's here.

1119
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:43,880
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

1120
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,350
Your phone's out of order.

1121
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:56,310
No, it's not.

1122
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,020
It's been busy all day.

1123
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,900
It's Josh talking to his dad.

1124
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:06,700
I.... I got back this afternoon.
I thought I'd surprise you.

1125
01:50:07,530 --> 01:50:08,660
You did.

1126
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:13,410
Uh.... Maybe you'd like to go have dinner?

1127
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:17,080
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

1128
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:19,210
I'm having dinner with Bernie Kaufman.

1129
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:24,170
- How come?
- Because he asked me.

1130
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:27,510
Mom? Dad wants to talk to you.

1131
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:30,930
He wants me to come
to Southampton for Easter.

1132
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:33,730
- Oh, hi, George.
- Hi, Josh.

1133
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:35,730
You mad at me?

1134
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:37,480
Yeah.

1135
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:39,690
Mom says I should apologize.

1136
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,400
I think you should apologize
because you want to...

1137
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:47,070
...not because of your mother.

1138
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:50,160
- What if I don't want to?
- Uh....

1139
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,740
Then don't.

1140
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,620
- Okay, I won't.
- Why the hell not?

1141
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:00,380
- Hi.
- Hi.

1142
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:02,590
I'm Bernie Kaufman.
Your mom expects me.

1143
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,340
She's on the phone.

1144
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:08,090
I'll apologize to you
if you apologize to Mom.

1145
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:10,890
- Why should I do that?
- Because you've been a real shit!

1146
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:13,100
- You little....
- I'll tell her you're here.

1147
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:17,390
- Bernie Kaufman.
- Hi. George Webber.

1148
01:51:17,850 --> 01:51:20,110
Okay, I'll see you later.

1149
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:26,610
- You two know each other?
- I think we just met.

1150
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:28,450
- Hi, Bernie.
- Hi

1151
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:31,160
- You know where the Scotch is.
- No, I don't.

1152
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:32,530
Make yourself at home.

1153
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,500
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

1154
01:51:45,590 --> 01:51:46,630
Yes?

1155
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:50,300
- What did you do, work all night?
- I did. Was it worth it?

1156
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:52,100
As a matter of fact, it was.

1157
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:53,890
One of your better lyrics.

1158
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:57,180
I was inspired by
one of your better melodies.

1159
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:59,190
Hmm.

1160
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:01,690
You don't sound happy.

1161
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,820
I've always gone on
the premise that...

1162
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:07,400
...to be happy,
you have to feel happy.

1163
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:09,280
How's Larry?

1164
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:12,990
He's traveling abroad.

1165
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:15,790
I got a telegram saying
he might come back.

1166
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,830
But due to some...

1167
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:21,830
...foolish pride,
I don't think I'll take him back.

1168
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,050
Have you seen Sam?

1169
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,220
She's going out to dinner
with Bernie Kaufman.

1170
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:33,680
Don't do as I do. Do as I say.

1171
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:36,140
Kill if you must, but don't lose her.

1172
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:39,310
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1173
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:04,500
It's easy to say

1174
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:08,170
It's over

1175
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:14,220
It's easy

1176
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:16,220
To say

1177
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:20,730
We're the best of friends

1178
01:53:22,730 --> 01:53:27,020
You walk away and for a while

1179
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:31,900
You try the summer

1180
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:35,700
Of a younger smile

1181
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:42,500
But the memory never ends

1182
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:52,090
You could lose your mind

1183
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:55,930
But then you'll find

1184
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:02,810
It's easy to say

1185
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:06,060
I love you

1186
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:14,240
There's only one way to say

1187
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:17,530
I love you

1188
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:22,910
You could search the years away

1189
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:27,880
That old cliché

1190
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,800
Is the first of May

1191
01:54:31,050 --> 01:54:32,300
Too old...

1192
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:36,130
...for new love

1193
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:42,140
It's easy to say

1194
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:46,270
It's easy

1195
01:54:46,770 --> 01:54:50,150
As A, B, C

1196
01:54:51,110 --> 01:54:55,650
I love you

1197
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,410
Love you

1198
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:06,040
Love you

1199
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,880
That is pretty.

1200
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:16,340
Yeah. Thank you.

1201
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:21,220
I was going to call it,
"I Love You, Samantha"...

1202
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:24,350
...but some old hack
got there before me.

1203
01:55:24,850 --> 01:55:27,020
It's the thought that counts.

1204
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,770
Yeah.

1205
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:31,440
Uh....

1206
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:34,190
- Sam?
- Hm?

1207
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:41,580
Do you want to get married?

1208
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:53,170
No.

1209
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:55,130
Oh, um....

1210
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:57,760
Why not?

1211
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:59,720
Just as a matter of interest.

1212
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:03,220
We spend too much time
arguing and not enough making love.

1213
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:06,220
I could work on that.

1214
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:09,600
You know, just reverse that trend.

1215
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:12,770
Make a lot of love,
and just that much arguing.

1216
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:15,570
- As easy as that?
- You've got it.

1217
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:18,070
It would make a difference.

1218
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:20,700
So you'll think about it?

1219
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:23,580
- Unless you want to argue.
- Oh, no.

1220
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:27,250
I want to make a cup of coffee.

1221
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:37,090
And think about it.

1222
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:46,260
- Any action?
- Ehh.

1223
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:49,890
She's in the kitchen.
He's playing the piano.

1224
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:52,230
And I've had it!

1225
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:54,730
That's it, George!

1226
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:58,780
For one year I've been providing
X-rated entertainment...

1227
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:02,320
...and you reciprocate with PG!

1228
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:05,580
It's an iniquitous arrangement!

1229
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:09,500
- What's iniquitous?
- I show him mine, he don't show his!

1230
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:12,790
Come on, Rapunzel.
From now on, we do it in the dark!

1231
