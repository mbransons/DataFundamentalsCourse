1
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:34,073
Here they come.

2
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:44,858
Hi.

3
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:46,110
Hi. Kate.

4
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,357
Hi. Anne.

5
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:50,979
Here. let me take that.
I’ll get that out of your way.

6
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:52,254
- Kate?
- Hi. babe.

7
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:54,749
Oh. look at this.

8
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,761
No. don‘t do that.
It’s for tomorrow.

9
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,297
Well. for him
there‘s no tomorrow.

10
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:00,640
Jack. control yourself.
Please.

11
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:01,786
Hey. what are
you doing?

12
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,030
I waited 20 minutes in line
for that. Come on.

13
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,106
All right. Give me
some of that. Come on.

14
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:08,760
Are we all here?

15
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,526
Yeah. Let‘s go.

16
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:26,744
Hey!

17
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,623
The guy is going away
for a weekend

18
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,860
and he‘s bringing
his whole wardrobe.

19
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,122
Be careful.

20
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:40,536
Don‘t worry about
the eggplants.

21
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,300
I got five of them.

22
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,416
You got five eggplants?

23
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,082
What do you mean.
the baby ones?

24
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:47,640
Baby ones?
They‘re like salamis.

25
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:49,980
13 eggplants.

26
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,870
Isn‘t that kind of a lot?

27
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,975
You can never have
too many eggplants.

28
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:55,542
Hi. how are you?
Hi.

29
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,893
Claudia‘s at her studio.

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,098
Turn left on Christopher.
right on Hudson.

31
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,137
Hey. what happened
to the bread?

32
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,312
What is this.
you started without me?

33
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,375
Need help?

34
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:09,876
I’m okay.

35
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,577
Hi. Claudia.

36
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,461
Hi.

37
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:14,550
Hi. Claudia.

38
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:16,215
You brought your work.

39
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:18,141
I stopped my work
for the weekend.

40
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:19,864
Danny. please.
You‘re a dentist.

41
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,144
Do you hear this?

42
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:23,603
I can sculpt a bicuspid
that would fool God himself.

43
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:24,791
but I’m just a dentist.

44
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,248
Do we-- Do we have
any ginger?

45
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:29,875
I got two pounds of ginger
and a pound of garlic.

46
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:32,500
Anne. didn‘t you have
a tree there?

47
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:34,775
Yeah. but we just<i>...</i>
We had to cut it down.

48
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,948
I miss it. You could see it
from the bedroom.

49
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,328
Hey. we have locks. right?

50
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:40,728
Two locks. A big lock
and a little lock.

51
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,452
Oh. I love those flowers.

52
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:45,041
I forgot my cleaver.

53
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:46,739
That‘s all right.
I got a cleaver.

54
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,086
Would you believe this?

55
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:50,455
They‘ve been organizing
this one meal for two weeks?

56
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,928
I believe it.

57
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,183
God. look at that.

58
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:57,679
Wait a minute. Look at this.
How did you trace this?

59
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:59,727
What do you do.
throw them up in the air?

60
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:01,078
I took a piece of glass

61
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,054
put the vegetables
on the glass.
and I got--

62
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:05,104
Wait. That‘s<i>...</i>
That one I want.

63
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:06,671
Oh. isn‘t that gorgeous?

64
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:08,086
Is this the way this goes?

65
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:09,167
Yes.

66
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:10,320
It looks like a face.

67
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:11,734
It does looks like a face.

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,294
The nose. the eyes. the ears.

69
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,343
Did you try the Pegasus
Gallery in SoHo?

70
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,304
Yes. I just<i>....</i>
I can‘t believe that man.

71
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,076
I just<i>...</i>
I told him
that I had been working

72
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,696
on this series of
pictures for three years.

73
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,872
and do you know
what he said?

74
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:28,438
He said. ‘‘Three years
photographing vegetables?

75
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:30,675
‘‘Don‘t you think
that‘s a little constipated?‘‘

76
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:32,019
Do you believe that?

77
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,960
Well. that all depends
on the vegetables.

78
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,082
What you gonna do
with the cover?

79
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:41,744
Take it off.
Please take it off.

80
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,149
The chili pepper‘s cooking.
They have to be charred.

81
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:45,622
Okay. It will be charred.

82
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,115
Oh. come on.

83
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,135
Cook or laugh.
what is this?

84
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:56,337
Well. do something with it.
Pour water on it.

85
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:58,315
Pour water on hot oil.
You‘re kidding. right?

86
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,462
My eyes are tearing.
I can‘t see what I’m doing.

87
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,574
We‘re gonna have
chopped knuckles
and hot garlic sauce.

88
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:03,955
Here. here.
I really can‘t see.

89
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:06,193
Wait. Come here. come here.
How is that? Is that better?

90
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:07,373
Oh. terrific.

91
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,169
You rubbed it in
real good. I’m blind.

92
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:11,146
The oil‘s not hot enough.

93
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:13,108
Then why have l
lost my eyesight?

94
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:14,317
It’s not hot enough.

95
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:17,869
You cannot cook Chinese food
unless the oil is 480 degrees.

96
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:19,795
Oh. damn.
It’s a scientific fact.

97
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,778
Did Einstein say that?

98
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:24,714
Newton. Isaac Newton.
The inventor of Mu Shu Pork.

99
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,209
Hey. Anne?
Mmm-hmm?

100
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,999
The magazine
is doing a piece

101
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:32,719
on the top 10 executives
in the country.

102
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,921
How would you like to
photograph them for us?

103
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:37,264
Oh. God.
I’d love to be in <i>Fortune.</i>

104
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,109
When do you need them?

105
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,227
By July.

106
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,553
You mean of this year?

107
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,666
Anne.
that‘s two months
from now.

108
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:48,843
Yes. dear. I know that.

109
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,442
I just<i>...</i>

110
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:51,660
I don‘t work that fast.

111
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,026
Anne. how are you ever
going to get published?

112
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:56,203
You have to move.

113
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,518
What‘s the matter
with you?

114
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,848
Just do a story on
the top 10 broccoli
in the country.

115
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,182
Chicken salad.
You got the rice things?

116
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,460
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

117
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,734
Do it now
and they‘ll all be ready
at the same time.

118
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,395
I’ve got this
timed out scientifically.

119
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,506
Yes. sir.
Watch this. Watch this.
You ready?

120
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:11,854
Yeah. Watch out.

121
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:13,166
Watch this. Here we go.

122
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,619
Isn‘t that beautiful?

123
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,031
That‘s incredible.

124
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:19,307
Okay. First course.

125
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:27,915
And Chinese beer.

126
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:29,512
Bravo!

127
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:30,599
Bravo!
Bravo!

128
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:32,298
Thank you.

129
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,127
Did you leave out the MSG?

130
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,851
No MSG.
Grab your sticks and eat.

131
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,230
Here‘s some rice.
Pass it around.

132
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,118
Wait. wait.
Start with the appetizers.

133
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:40,678
That‘s
the chicken salad.

134
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:44,394
Oh. my God. Danny.
That‘s fantastic.

135
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,252
Wait.
Pass it around!

136
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:48,746
Danny‘s
my genius!

137
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:50,277
The shrimp
is incredible.

138
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,935
Okay. I have a toast.

139
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:55,557
Toast. To Nick and Anne.

140
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:56,873
Yeah.

141
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:59,495
And to this dinner
which is wonderful.

142
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,120
Watch it. watch it.
watch it.

143
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,579
And to the reason
we‘re here tonight.

144
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,457
Not just to
celebrate your anniversary.

145
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:11,276
but to that deeper thing
that brings us
all close together.

146
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:14,692
To what bonds us. and--and

147
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:17,799
makes us huddle against
the cold winds of divorce

148
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,041
that have blown through
the lives of our friends.

149
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,092
Oh. that‘s lovely.

150
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,075
- Really nice.
- Nice. nice.

151
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,163
Thanks. Jack.

152
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:25,252
May I say something?

153
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,340
Yes.

154
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,940
I just wanna say
that l<i>...</i>

155
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,501
That was the most
depressing goddamn toast

156
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:32,002
that I have ever heard
in my life.

157
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:34,147
Why? Why?

158
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,465
What‘s wrong with that?

159
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:36,613
He got to the heart
of it.

160
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,114
He faced it.
He told us his fears.

161
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:39,595
That‘s why
we‘re here.

162
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:41,417
That‘s why I’m in analysis.
you know.

163
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:43,492
It’s not why
I’m eating dinner.

164
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:44,874
Well. I think he‘s right.

165
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,282
That‘s what
brought us together.

166
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,520
I don‘t get this close
with all my patients.

167
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:50,181
We didn‘t meet through you.

168
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:51,429
Sure we did!
Oh!

169
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,645
We did! We did!

170
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:54,145
Didn‘t I do
some legal work for you?

171
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,740
Then we all got to
know one another.
started going out together.

172
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,754
No. I remember
going over your statement.

173
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:01,130
We did not meet
through the men at all.

174
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:03,399
No. They think everything
revolves around them.

175
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:05,507
Anne is
absolutely right.

176
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:06,721
You and l.

177
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:09,162
we met at a women‘s
photographers exhibition

178
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:12,129
and then Anne and l
met Claudia
at an art gallery.

179
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:14,821
You didn‘t get at their teeth
until months later.

180
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:16,614
Uh. we met seven years ago.

181
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:18,537
It was the third week.
Thank you.

182
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:20,064
The third week in July.

183
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,328
And my first appointment
with Danny was. uh.
for a filling.

184
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,725
It was. uh. September 8.

185
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,502
and it was a Wednesday.

186
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,998
How can you remember that?

187
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:33,984
Oh. uh. I remember
things like that

188
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:36,359
because I feel
they‘re important.

189
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:39,463
Look. the point is
what brings us together.

190
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:41,282
- Right. That‘s the point.
- Right?

191
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,401
That‘s the point.

192
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:45,572
We owe the depth. breadth
and height of this friendship

193
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:48,129
to the world‘s
most ancient emotions:

194
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:51,137
fear and panic.

195
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,951
Am I right? Am I right?

196
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:55,333
I love you.
Am I right?

197
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,156
Listen. I spent three hours
buying this

198
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:59,167
and four hours chopping it
into little pieces.

199
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,313
I’m not just gonna eat it.
I’m gonna make love to it.

200
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:02,845
You keep talking.
I’ll eat yours.

201
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:06,243
Wait. Come on.
Cut it out.

202
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:12,380
Come on.
he‘s down in the orchard.

203
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:14,310
I--I can‘t get
this damn fender
straightened.

204
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,390
I’ll see you down there.

205
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:16,609
Yeah.

206
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:36,477
Hey. you look great.

207
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,044
Don‘t get too close.
Watch your foot.

208
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:39,198
Come on.
I’ll race you.

209
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,572
I’m going fast enough.
I just wanna dry my hair.

210
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:43,548
Come on. We‘ll see who
gets to the house first.

211
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,760
Let‘s just see
if we can get there.
How about that?

212
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,910
Hey. you want a helmet?

213
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:48,989
Of course
I want a helmet.

214
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:53,722
Oh. that‘s better.
That‘s nice.

215
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:57,955
Hey. Danny!

216
00:09:58,757 --> 00:09:59,772
Hey! You wanna race?

217
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:00,892
No.

218
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,623
Come on. Let‘s race a little.

219
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,416
Look.
leave me alone. will you?

220
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:05,979
You look great on that thing.

221
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,678
Come on. What do you say?

222
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:09,756
I don‘t wanna race!

223
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:11,651
Good. You ready?

224
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:12,960
Go!

225
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:21,148
Go. Danny. Go! Go! Go!

226
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:28,476
Whoa!

227
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:30,336
Watch out! Watch out!

228
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,778
I won!

229
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:43,808
I won! I did it!
I did it! I won!

230
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:46,300
I won! I won!

231
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,602
What happened?
Are you all right?

232
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,235
Yeah. I’m fine.
Are you okay?

233
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,281
I am the greatest!

234
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:54,815
The sexy dentist won!

235
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,446
I won!

236
00:10:56,546 --> 00:11:00,091
Danny. you‘re wonderful!
I love you!

237
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:11,324
How. how about Indian food
next time?

238
00:11:11,393 --> 00:11:13,465
We can-- We can make
our own mango chutney.

239
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:15,097
we can fry a little <i>chapatí.</i>

240
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:16,630
How about Indonesian?

241
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,166
We could do
a whole rice table.

242
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,517
Oh. yeah.
That will be great.

243
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,697
I love that.

244
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,224
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I think I got it.

245
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:24,279
What?

246
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:25,367
It’s 1 :00.

247
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,749
Homemade pasta.

248
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:27,765
Yeah?

249
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,247
Florentine
Chicken.

250
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:30,261
Mmm-hmm.

251
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,539
<i>...</i>on a-- on
a bed of spinach.

252
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:33,589
Oh. yeah.

253
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:37,307
And a hot antipasto
of mussels

254
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,198
in marinara sauce.
How about that?

255
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,540
Is that good?

256
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,941
Danny. please.
I’m Italian.

257
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,626
Oh. you don‘t think
we can do it. huh?

258
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:48,116
Didn‘t we make
a great Chinese meal
last night?

259
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,296
Yeah. Well.
look. we‘re not Chinese.
You know?

260
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,505
By us it was Chinese.
What do we know?

261
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:55,547
Danny. please.
She‘s Italian.

262
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,662
Yeah.

263
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:58,677
I can make a better sauce
than your mother.

264
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,928
My poor mother
has arthritis.

265
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:01,787
Of course you make
a better sauce than her.

266
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,447
Before her arthritis.

267
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:07,612
Will you guys shut up?
You‘re depressing the birds.

268
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:09,716
How‘s your leg?

269
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,131
Oh. fine.

270
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,849
I’ve been banged up so many
times I hardly even notice it.

271
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:16,917
In college he played
football with a broken wrist

272
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:19,378
and then two big guys
picked him up

273
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:20,598
and threw him on his head

274
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,556
and he was unconscious
for three hours.

275
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,792
Those were the days.

276
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,441
Hey. Hey.

277
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:31,257
Listen to the water
lapping against
the sides of the boat.

278
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,662
To be with friends
sipping wine.

279
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:38,488
this is what it is
to be happy.

280
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:41,458
This.
and being incredibly rich.

281
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,941
I’m a lifetime member
of Equitable‘s
Million Dollar Roundtable.

282
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:51,124
Gimme some cheese.
will you?

283
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:53,497
I’m one of
the most successful
estate planners in New York.

284
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:55,156
But that‘s nothing
compared to this.

285
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:57,496
Nick. please.
I wish that you would relax.

286
00:12:57,563 --> 00:12:59,570
Please.
He‘s always selling.

287
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:01,203
What are you
talking about?

288
00:13:01,274 --> 00:13:02,933
You‘re an
estate planner?

289
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:04,180
You‘re an
insurance salesman.

290
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,451
I don‘t plan estates?

291
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,464
I’m not on
the Million Dollar Roundtable?

292
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,783
Oh. Do you know
what you get

293
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,673
for being in
the Million Dollar Roundtable?

294
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:12,785
What?
What?

295
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,833
A plastic statue
and a weekend.

296
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:18,168
a weekend
at the La Cucaracha Hotel
in Puerto Rico.

297
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:23,665
What are you doing?

298
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,873
I’m gonna make a toast.

299
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:27,222
Again? Not another one?

300
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:28,783
Here‘s to us.

301
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:31,128
Here‘s to apple trees.

302
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:33,455
to cheese<i>...</i>

303
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:34,511
Here‘s to cheese?

304
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:37,975
<i>...</i>and wine and friends
and laughter.

305
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:40,337
and life itself.

306
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,351
That‘s beautiful. Sit down.

307
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:44,821
Carefully.

308
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,443
Oh. shit.

309
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:48,559
What. again?

310
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:50,355
I don‘t want
this afternoon to disappear

311
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:52,247
without something
to remember it by.

312
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:54,450
Some memorial of our
affection for one another.

313
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,501
Yeah. Terrific.

314
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:57,267
But just don‘t
wave your arms. okay?

315
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,158
This is for all of you

316
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:01,012
so that we‘ll never forget
this day.

317
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,389
Yeah.

318
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:10,868
I don‘t believe it!

319
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,724
What are you doing
in the lake?

320
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:17,040
All right.
I accept that gesture
from my friend.

321
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,044
He‘s not gonna be alone
in doing it.

322
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,581
My only regret is that

323
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:25,745
I’m not wearing my $500 suit.

324
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,507
I’ll just jump in
with my bread.

325
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:15,528
Hey. uh<i>...</i>

326
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:16,945
Hey.

327
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:19,529
You all right?

328
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:21,004
Sure.

329
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,502
You look distracted.

330
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:25,965
I’m okay.

331
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,128
You know.

332
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:33,841
I think we‘re close enough to
say anything to each other.

333
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,260
Really. Anything.

334
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,144
You and Kate happy?

335
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:51,728
Yeah. Very.

336
00:15:53,298 --> 00:15:55,240
I mean. happy.

337
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,964
Can you honestly say
you‘re really happy?

338
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,928
Yeah. but not
every minute.

339
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,619
It comes in waves.

340
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,305
At times you hit lows

341
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:09,580
and you can‘t stand things
about each other.

342
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,909
Like the way
her teeth click
when she eats.

343
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:15,340
The way I smell my sweatshirt
before I put it on.

344
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,830
Sometimes we drive
each other crazy.

345
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:20,741
And then there are times

346
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,425
we go through a period
like the one we‘re in now.

347
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,214
It comes over us
like an unexpected wave.

348
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,327
puppy love.

349
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,504
I can‘t wait to see her.

350
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,128
And then when I’m with her
my heart beats faster.

351
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,878
I’d expect it
with somebody
who‘s a stranger.

352
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:39,114
but not somebody
I’ve spent
half my life with.

353
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:40,709
It’s wonderful.

354
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:42,605
I wish I could feel that.

355
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,288
Oh. you will.
It‘ll come back.
Just give it time.

356
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:46,852
No. I’ve never felt it.

357
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,446
I shouldn‘t have
married Anne.

358
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,990
I was crazy as a kid.

359
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,062
I figured
she‘d be some kind of
stability for me.

360
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:10,023
Well.
she certainly is stable.

361
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,956
I mean. she‘s a decent woman.
she‘s a good mother

362
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:16,134
but she doesn‘t
do anything.

363
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:18,018
Doesn‘t think anything.

364
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:21,219
I’ve never heard
one stimulating idea

365
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,951
come out of her mouth ever.

366
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,542
When she took up photography.

367
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,881
I thought. finally
she‘s gonna do something.

368
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:31,498
She spent three years
photographing vegetables.

369
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,143
She‘s not just stable.
she‘s inert.

370
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:37,153
So work on it with her.
Talk to her about it.

371
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:40,325
Jack. I’ve tried for 20 years.
I get nothing.

372
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,193
Do you know how painful it is
to want to love someone?

373
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:50,120
You‘ve no idea
how lonely I’ve been.

374
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:58,080
Look at her.
Look at her.

375
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:03,524
She gets obsessed with that.

376
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:05,699
She‘ll pace up and down
all day long

377
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,777
with the same thought.
turning it over and over

378
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:08,743
in her head.

379
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:10,816
She remembers the day
she got her tooth filled.

380
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,744
Can you remember that?

381
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:16,128
Christ. I can barely remember
the first time I got laid.

382
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:19,976
I come home from
a day‘s selling.

383
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,634
she wants to
talk about her work.

384
00:18:21,705 --> 00:18:23,843
Fine. You know what
she talks about?

385
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,287
Vegetables.

386
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,906
For a year and a half
we talked about zucchini.

387
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,830
Then for a year.
green peppers.

388
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:30,911
That was a nice change.

389
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,445
Last night
was the end of 21 years.

390
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,138
And that‘s enough.

391
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,405
Today‘s the beginning
of a new life for me.

392
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,658
What?

393
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:44,900
That‘s it. It’s over.

394
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,540
You can‘t just quit.
What--what are you<i>...</i>

395
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:51,974
What are you talking about?
What‘s the matter with you?

396
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,461
I want to make a new start.
I want a new family.

397
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,876
What about your old family?

398
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:58,179
Lisa‘s 18.
She can handle this.

399
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:01,436
I want a woman
I can be excited by.

400
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:05,438
You‘ve got somebody else.
don‘t you?

401
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,071
You got somebody
waiting in the wings.

402
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,761
No. I don‘t.
I swear I don‘t have anybody
waiting in the wings.

403
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:11,685
Why are you making this
so difficult for me?

404
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,605
I thought
I could tell you anything.

405
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,405
How can you
just throw her away
after 21 years like this?

406
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:23,485
I mean. what is she
supposed to do now?

407
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,096
Oh. boy.

408
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:34,108
I thought if I told you.
you‘d be happy for me.

409
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:37,311
I even had this fantasy that
you‘d handle the divorce.

410
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,249
That I would handle
the divorce?

411
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:44,451
In the first place.
I’m not a divorce lawyer

412
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,720
and if I were.
I’d probably represent Anne.

413
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,249
I can‘t believe
you would do this.

414
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:50,778
Jack. please.

415
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:54,906
This is the hardest thing
I’ve ever gone through
in my life.

416
00:19:58,147 --> 00:19:59,903
All right. I’m sorry.

417
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:08,249
Oh. God.
Nick. this is awful. Jesus.

418
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,476
Come on. let‘s go.

419
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,473
Want some more of these?

420
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:27,425
Oh. yes. Thank you.
Good. good.

421
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,033
You know.
beans are very much
misunderstood.

422
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,683
They have a complex set
of amino acids.

423
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,497
lf you eat beans
together with rice.

424
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,031
you never have to
eat meat.

425
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:41,211
Danny loves to
talk about beans.

426
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,289
Go ahead. sweetheart.
Talk.

427
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:46,102
It’s the combination
that counts.
Here. you want some of these?

428
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,159
Yeah. I do.

429
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:48,891
You know. I’ve been
thinking about that.

430
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,074
About what?

431
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,032
Photographing vegetables
in combinations.

432
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:54,584
not just one at a time.
You know?

433
00:20:58,336 --> 00:20:59,743
I’m not sure yet.

434
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,697
Hey. I did some research
on sailboats for the summer.

435
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:05,783
That‘s great.

436
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:06,870
Already?

437
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:09,083
We only talked about it
a couple of days ago.

438
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:11,323
I got it in here someplace.
Here it is.

439
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:12,734
Nick.
you ought to check this out.

440
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,977
You‘re the sailor
in the group.

441
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:15,673
Where did you get
all this stuff?

442
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:17,019
Called a couple
of boat brokers.

443
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,396
- No kidding.
- Let me see one.

444
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,667
We can rent one in St. Thomas
and sail around the islands

445
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:22,840
and fly home. The whole thing
will take two weeks.

446
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:24,821
This woman‘s fantastic.

447
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:26,455
Nick. isn‘t this beautiful?

448
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:27,639
What a boat.

449
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:29,053
Oh. is that the galley?

450
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,133
Yes.

451
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,286
And you know what?

452
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,430
I think it looks<i>...</i>
It looks a little small to me.

453
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,517
Gorgeous.

454
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,572
Yeah. right.

455
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:37,469
Oh. l--I think
we‘ll manage very well.

456
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:38,482
don‘t you?

457
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,795
Oh. I think it‘s beautiful.

458
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:42,323
Oh. look at that.

459
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:11,125
Can‘t you sleep?

460
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,891
Nick is getting
a divorce.

461
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,829
How do you know?

462
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:23,354
He told me yesterday when
we were getting firewood.

463
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:26,771
Jeez.

464
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,851
Is there somebody else?

465
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:33,107
He says
there isn‘t anybody.

466
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:37,305
Why does he have to leave her?
Why can‘t they fight it out?

467
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:48,470
Hold me?

468
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,957
Good morning.

469
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:07,503
You got up early.

470
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,002
Oh. god. It’s
gorgeous down there.

471
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:10,900
Yeah?
There‘s this
enormous turtle.

472
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,622
You didn‘t try to ride him.
did you?

473
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:15,311
Ride a turtle that big?
Are you kidding?

474
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:17,518
I was thinking of it.
but I got scared.

475
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,214
Oh. Good morning.

476
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,462
Hey. could you
sleep last night?

477
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:28,052
Not very well.
What is it with them?

478
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:31,092
I don‘t know. boy.

479
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:32,433
Oh. I thought
I smelled coffee.

480
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,645
Good morning. Danny.

481
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:35,604
Thank you. Good morning.
How are you?

482
00:24:37,204 --> 00:24:38,546
It’s great.

483
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:41,779
Oh my God.
Daylight.

484
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,816
Claudia thinks
she‘s seasick.

485
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:45,996
Are you?

486
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,115
No.

487
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:49,259
I’m just trying out
this new green makeup.

488
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:51,154
Claudia.
you‘re not nauseated.

489
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,107
Danny. how come
you‘re allowed to have

490
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:54,797
all these
psychosomatic illnesses.

491
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,288
but when I throw up
into my tote bag
at 2:00 in the morning.

492
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,305
it‘s just my imagination?

493
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,350
Did anyone sleep
last night?

494
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,306
You‘re kidding. right?

495
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,873
With all those mating calls
coming from
the master bedroom?

496
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:09,929
All night long.

497
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:11,431
I mean.
who could have guessed

498
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:12,815
that it would be
so distressing

499
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,508
to listen to
other people humping?

500
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:15,560
Hi. gang.

501
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:16,943
Good morning.
Morning.

502
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:21,032
What a morning!

503
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:25,070
Oh. boy. smell that air.
Huh?

504
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:26,086
Yeah.

505
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:28,423
Now. this is how
the whole world should live.

506
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:29,512
Uh-huh?

507
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:30,829
I slept like a baby
last night.

508
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:31,944
Wasn‘t that
a great night?

509
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,156
Oh. yeah.
It was great. Yeah.

510
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:37,064
Wasn‘t it peaceful
bobbing around on the water
like that?

511
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:39,439
Yeah. well.
some parts of the boat
bobbed more than others.

512
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:43,052
Hey. honey. throw on
your suit and come on up!

513
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,233
Coffee‘s on.

514
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:48,620
- Hi!
- Good morning.

515
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:49,932
Good morning.

516
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,040
Did anybody hear anything
about the weather?

517
00:25:52,112 --> 00:25:54,086
Oh. yeah. did you listen
to the radio yet?

518
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,687
Yeah.
it‘s supposed to be clear.

519
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,702
After breakfast.
should we head for St. Croix?

520
00:25:57,775 --> 00:26:00,557
Wait a minute.
You wanna move the boat?

521
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:03,308
Come on.
once you get used to it

522
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,317
you‘ll be
the most intrepid sailor
of the bunch.

523
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:07,246
I don‘t see how
we‘re gonna go anywhere

524
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:08,555
unless we can get
the anchor up.

525
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:10,249
Well. we‘ll just pull it up.
Pull it up?

526
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,206
Isn‘t that why
we had to stay here
last night.

527
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,245
because we couldn‘t
pull the anchor up?

528
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,701
Nah. if the three of us
give it a yank. it‘ll come up.
Come on.

529
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:19,945
You boys go pull on
your anchor for a while.

530
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:21,803
We‘ll be back here.

531
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,252
lf that anchor comes up
out of the water.
there is no God.

532
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:28,202
Nick just amazes me.

533
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,049
I mean. he‘s so accomplished.

534
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:33,932
He can sail.
He knows how to choose wines.

535
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,564
Do you know
that he‘s just about

536
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:37,768
the most successful
estate planner in New York?

537
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:38,884
Is that so?

538
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:39,939
Yeah.

539
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:43,046
He‘s a life member in
the Million Dollar Roundtable.

540
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:45,092
I hear they send you
to Puerto Rico for that.

541
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:46,921
Oh. yeah.
He goes all over the place.

542
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:50,411
We met on my flight to L.A.

543
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:53,953
I sat with him for an hour
after the dinner service
and<i>...</i>

544
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,719
God. I had just
never met anybody

545
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:58,243
who knew so much about
actuarial tables.

546
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,560
He‘s a charmer.

547
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:01,122
Yeah.

548
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,092
How about Danny?
Has he been sailing long?

549
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:09,347
No.

550
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,558
Well. how about Jack?

551
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:14,914
Jack saw
<i>Two Years Before The Mast</i>
when he was 12.

552
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,606
One. two. heave ho!

553
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:19,496
Come on.
We‘re not gonna make it.

554
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:21,253
This is like
pulling a building.

555
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:23,331
Okay. Come on.
Danny. watch your foot.

556
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:24,547
Watch out. Watch out.

557
00:27:24,618 --> 00:27:25,862
It’s stuck on something.

558
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,840
There‘s a big plant down
there or something.

559
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,824
I’ll run her over.
Tell me when it‘s vertical.

560
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,938
You‘re gonna what?
I’m gonna start up the engine.

561
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,214
You tell me when this rope
is straight up and down. okay?

562
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:36,191
Do you know what the hell
he‘s talking about?

563
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:41,186
Hey.

564
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,272
What?

565
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,623
Maybe we
shouldn‘t go anywhere.

566
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,145
Everybody‘s worried
that we don‘t know
what we‘re doing.

567
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:48,072
I know what I’m doing.

568
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:49,544
Hey.
your nose is getting red.

569
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,886
You better
put something on it.

570
00:27:50,953 --> 00:27:53,092
Well. I just think that
if anybody‘s nervous about it

571
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,851
we should stop
and talk about<i>...</i>

572
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,608
What is this?

573
00:27:58,793 --> 00:27:59,808
I don‘t know.
Open it up.

574
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,287
Oh. my God.

575
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:07,326
Shalimar?

576
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:09,822
Oh. my God.

577
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:12,832
You are
the sweetest man.

578
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,702
Look at this.

579
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:18,020
He‘s given me a present

580
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:20,870
every single day
since we left St. Thomas.

581
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,484
You could make me
fall in love with you
pretty easily.

582
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:27,455
You mean
it could get worse?

583
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,533
Excuse me.

584
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:34,017
Okay. I’m gonna move her up.
Tell me when.

585
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:41,601
More, more, more.

586
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:43,808
More, more.

587
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:47,584
More, more, more, more<i>...</i>

588
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:50,211
Hold it.

589
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:53,884
Thank you.

590
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,543
You don‘t have to worry about
the anchor any more.

591
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:57,629
Come here.

592
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,650
You want us down there?

593
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:00,035
Yes.

594
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:01,214
At that end
of the boat?

595
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,456
Come here
and ready this sail.

596
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,532
Come on. Ollie.

597
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:08,701
They‘re really gonna
move it.

598
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:10,402
I doubt it.

599
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:11,930
Okay. what do you want us to do?

600
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,215
I want you to
raise the mizzen.

601
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,332
I’ll close the lid.

602
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:15,931
Close the lid.
we‘ll kill ourselves.

603
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:16,987
Close the hatch.

604
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,043
Where will I stand?

605
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:20,255
Right there.
Just pull on the rope
like we did yesterday.

606
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:21,698
I got it. I got it.
Like yesterday.

607
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:23,259
Okay.
I got the ribbons out here.

608
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:24,609
Ribbons?
The gaskets.

609
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:25,691
I’m pulling
the ropes.

610
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,975
Okay.
Okay?

611
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,260
There she goes!

612
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:34,810
Jack!

613
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:35,996
Oh. my God!

614
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,082
Here. Grab that.

615
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:39,065
Are you all right?

616
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:41,497
What the hell
are you trying to do?

617
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,481
Here. take this line.

618
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:45,629
Oh. my God.
The boat‘s moving.

619
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:46,714
What? What?

620
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:47,834
Turn the wheel.

621
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:49,532
Not on my boat.
Don‘t touch anything!

622
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:51,163
Turn the wheel.

623
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:56,418
Jesus Christ!

624
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:59,328
You go ahead. folks.
I’ll catch up.

625
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,052
What‘s that?
I think we‘re stuck.

626
00:30:01,122 --> 00:30:02,780
She‘s gone aground.
We‘re on a sandbar.

627
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,799
On the ground?

628
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:05,368
We‘re stuck. Yeah.
Look at that.

629
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:06,652
Oh. shit.

630
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:09,146
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

631
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:10,396
Sorry.

632
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,262
I’ll just get these
into the water.

633
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:15,711
Oh. Jesus!
They‘re so dirty.

634
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:16,857
Look.
my lettuce water.

635
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:18,784
I gotta clean them.

636
00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:23,613
Oh. now. wait a minute.
wait a minute. wait a minute.
No salt. okay?

637
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:24,858
Just put the salt

638
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:27,100
on the sides
of whoever wants to
poison themselves.

639
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:28,412
He doesn‘t
eat salt.

640
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,495
Salt is bad for you?

641
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,187
I haven‘t used salt
or mucus products
for three years

642
00:30:32,257 --> 00:30:33,850
and I feel just great.

643
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:35,327
Who eats mucus?

644
00:30:35,392 --> 00:30:36,733
He means
cheese and milk.

645
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,288
Danny. say what you mean.
will you please?

646
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,822
You‘re talking
to humans here.

647
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,976
Don‘t worry about it.
Danny.

648
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,804
This recipe
doesn‘t call for mucus.

649
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:45,050
- Got a knife?
- Excuse me.

650
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,429
Where‘s a knife?

651
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:47,772
Excuse me.

652
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:50,228
I think
I’m gonna die from the sun.

653
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:52,859
Why does my nose
always have to bother me?

654
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:54,268
Here. Danny.
let me get in here.

655
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,791
I got something
that‘ll make you feel better.

656
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:58,615
Here you go.
You put this--

657
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:00,093
Oh. no. no. no.
What?

658
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,744
You‘re not gonna put
that green. thorny thing
on my nose.

659
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:04,986
For God‘s sakes.
You take the jelly out of it.

660
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:07,421
It’s an aloe plant.
It‘ll make it just fine.

661
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:08,435
What?

662
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,255
You stabbed me
with that goddamn
Hawaiian plant.

663
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:12,373
Be careful.

664
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:13,755
I’m sorry.
It’s crowded in here.

665
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:15,927
Excuse me.
Would you excuse me. please?

666
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,132
I’m doing
the best I can.

667
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:19,994
Well. don‘t put it
in my lettuce.

668
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:21,206
Okay.

669
00:31:21,277 --> 00:31:25,238
Jack and Kate owe Nick and me
$1 23 each for provisions.

670
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:28,636
except for the wine and beer
which Nick brought.

671
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:31,450
which everybody owes him
$47 each for.

672
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,721
Why don‘t we just subtract
the $47 from the $1 23?

673
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:37,237
No. no. no. no. no.
That‘s gonna screw it up.

674
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:39,414
I’ve worked this out
very carefully.

675
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:42,778
And I’d just like to tell you
that we are now

676
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:46,394
$350 over budget each.

677
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:48,085
All right. all right.

678
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,585
I don‘t see any trip
to St. Croix

679
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,066
unless we have
a meeting first.

680
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:53,553
I don‘t picture us seeing
St. Croix
unless it floats by.

681
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:05,431
I can‘t believe
he brought her.

682
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:07,894
How could he do that
to Anne?

683
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:09,970
How could he do it to us?

684
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,345
But she‘s really nice.
you know.

685
00:32:12,411 --> 00:32:13,393
I mean. I like her.

686
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:15,092
She‘s wonderful.

687
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:16,752
I can‘t even enjoy
hating her.

688
00:32:16,827 --> 00:32:18,736
Who the hell
needs that?

689
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,162
Danny is driving me crazy.

690
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:24,179
He has to be
the expert on everything.

691
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,428
What‘s the matter
with him?

692
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:26,927
He‘s very needy.
That‘s all.

693
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:28,147
Needy?

694
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,690
He‘s hypochondriacally.
stingy. bossy. selfish.

695
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,176
compulsive. and paranoid.

696
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,773
He‘s the Muhammad Ali
of mental illness.

697
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:40,215
Shh. Quiet.

698
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:48,497
Look. if they don‘t want me
to keep the finances.
I won‘t.

699
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,223
But there‘s
something wrong with them.

700
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:53,777
These people are vicious.
They‘re ill.

701
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:56,532
We‘re traveling with
a group of ill people.

702
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:58,705
I just can‘t believe
that he would bring her

703
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,369
on the boat with us.

704
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,411
Every time
I make a suggestion.

705
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,229
every time I say something
they‘re ignorant of.

706
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:08,151
do you see the way
they look at each other?

707
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:09,939
They discuss me
behind my back.

708
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:12,528
I mean. she walks around
with that hanky on her hips

709
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,901
that‘s supposed to be
a bathing suit.

710
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:16,396
Oh. God.

711
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:18,838
I get so depressed
every time I look at her.

712
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:23,182
These people are vicious.
Vicious and ill.

713
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:33,201
I don‘t believe it.
They‘re at it again.

714
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:40,044
They never stop.

715
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,484
Those two
are gonna kill themselves.

716
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:02,580
They‘re driving me crazy.

717
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:07,274
Talk about something else.

718
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,803
Something serious
and complex.

719
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,599
We won‘t even<i>...</i>
We won‘t even notice it.

720
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:12,617
All right. Okay.

721
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:13,968
Something serious.
Okay. go ahead.

722
00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:15,978
Something serious and complex.

723
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:17,645
Tell me about
the Simmons suit.

724
00:34:17,716 --> 00:34:18,893
The. uh. Simmons suit.

725
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,011
The Simmons suit.

726
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:21,196
Yeah. Okay.

727
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,164
The Simmons suit.

728
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:28,015
Well. it all depends
how the judge interprets

729
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,425
the. uh.

730
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:31,313
environmental impact study.

731
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:35,666
Oh. yes.

732
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,247
Part of the problem
with inflation

733
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:57,265
is that the production
of goods and services

734
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,704
per man hour of work

735
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,624
is falling at a rate
of three percent a year.

736
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,249
What is she doing to him?

737
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:04,298
You‘re not listening.

738
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,896
Now. will you just listen?

739
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,976
lf productivity falls
three percent.

740
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:10,089
then wages
have to fall three percent.

741
00:35:10,257 --> 00:35:11,566
Are you listening?

742
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:16,614
Then the cost
of production rises.

743
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:28,076
What goes up
must come down.

744
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:38,019
So--

745
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,077
Again.

746
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:40,809
Oh. no. not again!

747
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:49,801
I can‘t take anymore of this.

748
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:16,549
Do you want
some breakfast?

749
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:20,266
I’m too sleepy to eat.
Those people are killing me.

750
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:23,972
I’m gonna make some coffee
and see if I can wake up.

751
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:27,111
Maybe if I lie in the sun
I can go back to sleep.

752
00:36:40,236 --> 00:36:41,316
Oh. my God.

753
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:48,740
What?

754
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,522
Down here. Quick.

755
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,466
Oh. my God.

756
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:57,415
Is the coffee ready?

757
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,850
I can‘t get my eyes open
this morning.

758
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,217
Maybe this‘ll get
your eyes open.

759
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,424
They‘re swimming already?
Where do they get the energy?

760
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:08,611
Keep looking at them.

761
00:37:08,682 --> 00:37:10,689
What am I supposed
to see?

762
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:14,215
A-ha.

763
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:21,252
What‘s the matter?
Is everybody sick?

764
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:23,750
Come here. come on.

765
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:29,631
Oh. my God.

766
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:34,182
You know.
when you really
think about it.

767
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,769
there isn‘t
anything sexual about it.

768
00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:38,558
It’s natural.

769
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:40,709
People go to
their doctor‘s offices.

770
00:37:40,777 --> 00:37:42,849
they take off
their clothes.

771
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:44,454
it doesn‘t
mean a thing.

772
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:47,621
Meanwhile. he hasn‘t
taken his eyes off her
for a second.

773
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:50,784
I almost got you.

774
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:51,903
Hi!

775
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,151
Hi!

776
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,945
Hi.
Hi.

777
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:00,287
Oh. they‘re
swimming over.

778
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,537
Oh. Jesus.
Oh. Lord.

779
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:03,266
Just act casual.

780
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:04,806
What you mean.
like you?

781
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:06,367
I’m gonna
make breakfast.

782
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:08,065
I don‘t wanna look
at my friends naked.

783
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:10,207
It makes it hard
to have dinner
with them later.

784
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:12,188
Yeah. I’m gonna go
sit in the shade.

785
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:14,914
And I think. maybe.
I’ll read a book.

786
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,482
Okay. Danny.
we‘ve all got something to do.

787
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,339
What‘s everybody
getting so crazy about?

788
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:23,780
You can‘t see anything.

789
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,372
Then what are you
standing there for?

790
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:27,868
He‘s hoping she‘ll turn over
and do the backstroke.

791
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:30,308
I was just enjoying
their playfulness.

792
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,860
They‘re like
a couple of porpoises.

793
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,651
It’s a pure animal pleasure
of having fun. that‘s all.

794
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:38,564
Danny. will you.
for Christ‘s sake. sit down?

795
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:44,154
What‘s the matter
with this woman?

796
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:45,690
Huh! Shit.

797
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,674
Hold it.
Okay. hold it there.

798
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:57,887
Now give me a hand
with this.

799
00:38:58,564 --> 00:39:00,222
Okay. Here we go.

800
00:39:01,764 --> 00:39:05,244
Okay. Danny. start the winch.
Crank it up.

801
00:39:09,412 --> 00:39:10,427
Okay.

802
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:11,645
That‘s it.

803
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:13,755
Kate. make sure
that tail line is taut.

804
00:39:13,827 --> 00:39:16,642
All right. come on.
keep going. Heave!

805
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:20,508
Keep cranking. Keep cranking.

806
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:21,692
All right. Ginny.

807
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:23,617
I wanna put
a little more pressure on it.

808
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:24,860
Hoist that sail.

809
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,272
Okay!

810
00:39:29,155 --> 00:39:30,496
That‘s it.

811
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:32,089
Danny.
Yeah?

812
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,144
That‘s it. darling.

813
00:39:33,218 --> 00:39:34,876
Now put
a little muscle into it.

814
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,904
Haul it away. That‘s it.
That‘s it. That‘s it.

815
00:39:44,194 --> 00:39:45,273
That‘s it!

816
00:39:46,882 --> 00:39:48,059
Yeah. yeah.
It’s working!

817
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:49,274
Terrific!
It’s working!

818
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,408
Yes! Yes!

819
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,537
Where the hell
are they going?

820
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,103
Hey. wait for us!

821
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:08,827
Claudia!
Claudia. back it up!

822
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:10,106
We‘re headed out to sea!

823
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:11,737
Isn‘t this terrific?

824
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,401
Put it in reverse!

825
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,837
Okay. tell me when.

826
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:57,014
Good. good.
Thank you. Thanks. honey.

827
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:01,436
Why do you think
we love this boat so much?

828
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,963
I don‘t know.

829
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:08,089
Do you know why I think
we like this boat so much?

830
00:41:08,157 --> 00:41:09,139
I knew it.
What?

831
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:10,522
I knew it.

832
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:13,239
He only asked us so he could
tell us his feelings.

833
00:41:13,308 --> 00:41:14,356
Oh. come on.

834
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:16,087
Go ahead. Go ahead.
sweetheart. tell us.

835
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:18,099
Why do we love
this boat so much?

836
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:21,434
Because it represents
our primeval desire
to control water.

837
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,060
Ah. See?

838
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,591
No. think about it.

839
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,799
All our beginnings were wet.

840
00:41:28,348 --> 00:41:31,763
Sloshing around in the womb.
baptism.

841
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:36,466
first life that came from
the warm soup of the ocean.

842
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,736
From the moment
we rose from the slime
as alligators.

843
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,224
we‘ve been trying
for dominion over water.

844
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:45,622
You know?

845
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,351
Mmm-hmm?

846
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:50,709
Jack loves ideas

847
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:52,306
and he can do so much
with them.

848
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,767
I have seen him take
one idea at a dinner party

849
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:56,784
and bring the conversation
of a dozen people

850
00:41:56,858 --> 00:41:58,167
to a complete halt.

851
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:02,322
Ladies and gentlemen.
Clams Casino.

852
00:42:03,578 --> 00:42:05,944
Oh. my God. I love them.

853
00:42:06,298 --> 00:42:09,265
I have this insatiable need
to have dominance
over the clam.

854
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:10,384
Take forks.

855
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:11,537
It so happens

856
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:14,097
that Venus rose from
the sea on a clam shell.

857
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:16,919
Sexuality was born
in wetness.

858
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:18,866
It’s easier that way.

859
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:23,890
Hey.

860
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:25,874
Mine‘s all closed up.

861
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:27,570
How‘d that happen?

862
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,950
I don‘t know.
Open it.

863
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:33,136
Lodge your finger in it.
Right.

864
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,139
Oh. Nick.

865
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,704
That must be some clam.

866
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,633
Look
what he gave me.

867
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,814
What a guy.

868
00:42:45,975 --> 00:42:47,536
I’m beginning to feel
left out.

869
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:52,342
Hmm. You got something. too?

870
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:54,573
Sand!

871
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,562
Oh!
Oh. Jack.

872
00:42:57,815 --> 00:42:59,441
That‘s all right.

873
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:04,014
I’m gonna go down below
for a few minutes.

874
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,229
I think I’ll see
if she‘s all right.

875
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,529
Do you think
they‘re gonna do it again?

876
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,338
You know.

877
00:43:25,558 --> 00:43:27,979
I’m real pissed off at him
for what he did to Anne.

878
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:29,427
but I have to
tell you.

879
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,116
I get a funny feeling

880
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:34,515
watching two people
who are that much in love.

881
00:43:36,885 --> 00:43:38,772
How do you suppose
we lost that?

882
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:41,138
We didn‘t.

883
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:44,243
Just ‘cause they‘re bumping
into the furniture
and we‘re not.

884
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:46,131
that doesn‘t mean
that we‘ve lost interest.

885
00:43:47,445 --> 00:43:49,354
Is he still thoughtful?

886
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:52,778
Yes. Jack is thoughtful.

887
00:43:52,852 --> 00:43:54,608
Does he observe
good bathroom etiquette?

888
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:55,690
Like what?

889
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:58,414
Well. like does he
leave the seat up
or does he put it down?

890
00:43:58,483 --> 00:44:00,818
It’s funny
how people tend to forget
little things like that.

891
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:03,120
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You‘re not talking about me.

892
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:04,267
I always
put the seat down.

893
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:05,419
Sure.
after I yelled at you.

894
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:07,214
Do you know
how many times in the dark

895
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:09,323
I’ve fallen that extra inch
onto the porcelain?

896
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:12,045
Anyway.
I don‘t find them
all that adorable.

897
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:14,122
They‘re making this trip
very difficult.

898
00:44:14,195 --> 00:44:15,755
They‘re not even
on this trip.

899
00:44:16,179 --> 00:44:18,699
They walk around
mooning all the time
making goo-goo eyes.

900
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:21,804
My God. if one of them farts.
the other thinks
it‘s Guy Lombardo.

901
00:44:23,698 --> 00:44:25,454
I think it‘s kind of nice.

902
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:27,213
I don‘t know. l<i>...</i>

903
00:44:28,722 --> 00:44:31,089
I want us all to feel
like we did before.

904
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:32,233
Hmm.

905
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:35,889
I wanna feel like them.

906
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:48,014
God. I love that woman.
She just kills me.

907
00:45:02,864 --> 00:45:04,042
Honey?

908
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:15,656
What?

909
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,691
It’s not the same anymore.
Everybody‘s different.

910
00:45:20,399 --> 00:45:21,512
Have you noticed that?

911
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,662
Yeah.

912
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:24,484
What is it?
Is it me or something?

913
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:25,867
No.
Are you sure?

914
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:27,112
You‘re not doing
anything.

915
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,808
You‘re a little jealous
of Nick.

916
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,692
No. I’m not.

917
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:31,781
Sure you are.

918
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,959
I’m not. What are you<i>...</i>
What are you talking about?

919
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,918
Look. honey.
it‘s only natural.

920
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:40,136
Look.
she‘s a beautiful. young.
adoring woman. right?

921
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:41,188
Yeah.

922
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:43,683
And she believes
every single thing
he tells her about himself.

923
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:45,699
Now. it‘s only natural
for you to want that.

924
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:47,748
Well. but l<i>...</i>
I’m jealous?

925
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:49,316
You preen for her.
I do not.

926
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:50,502
You do. too.

927
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:52,002
I don‘t.
Jack.

928
00:45:52,238 --> 00:45:53,764
Come on.
You walk around here

929
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:55,747
you‘re holding in
your stomach all the time.

930
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:57,829
You--you shave.
You comb your hair.

931
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,289
Well. l<i>...</i> No. I think
you‘ve misinterpreted
something.

932
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:02,187
No. now. excuse me. l--
Look. forget it.

933
00:46:02,252 --> 00:46:03,561
Enjoy your fantasies.

934
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:05,352
I don‘t have
any fantasies about her.

935
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:07,755
Yeah?
Well. no serious fantasies.

936
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,398
Well. you know.
for somebody who likes to
get to the heart of things.

937
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,370
you have
this incredible knack

938
00:46:14,444 --> 00:46:16,615
for denying
your own feelings.

939
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:17,894
You wish
I were jealous of him.

940
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:18,945
Why?

941
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:21,059
‘Cause that would alleviate
what you feel about her.

942
00:46:21,132 --> 00:46:23,368
Hey. you‘re getting angry.
No. no. no. I’m not. No.

943
00:46:23,435 --> 00:46:26,337
lf you‘re angry.
would you do me a favor
and just be angry?

944
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:27,426
I am not angry.

945
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,743
Don‘t start
with the analyzing.

946
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:29,826
I am not angry!

947
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:32,201
And you‘re not clenching
your teeth either. right?

948
00:46:33,483 --> 00:46:35,337
Okay. all right.
that‘s a problem I have.

949
00:46:35,403 --> 00:46:37,672
Sometimes when I get angry.
l--I analyze.

950
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:39,364
You certainly do.

951
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,839
You know why I do that?

952
00:46:40,906 --> 00:46:42,564
I don‘t care why!

953
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:45,123
Look. you got a little hate
going there. right?

954
00:46:45,194 --> 00:46:46,241
Admit it.

955
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:48,070
I am not angry
and I don‘t hate.

956
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,861
so just shut up
about that. okay?

957
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:53,603
Come on. shut up.

958
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,459
Will you slow down?

959
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,127
Do you know
where the brake is?

960
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:05,627
We got plenty of time.

961
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:08,604
You don‘t understand
the soul of a car like this.

962
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,052
It was born for speed.

963
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:11,645
I’m in complete control.

964
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:13,310
What are we cramped up
in here for?

965
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:14,942
We could‘ve used
their station wagon.

966
00:48:15,014 --> 00:48:17,086
A station wagon is a car.

967
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:19,834
A Mercedes
is a thoroughbred.

968
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:21,243
Every so often.

969
00:48:21,317 --> 00:48:23,586
it needs to be taken
on the open road
and challenged.

970
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:25,082
Want some?
Yeah. I’d love a bite.

971
00:48:25,157 --> 00:48:26,237
Don‘t eat!
What?

972
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:27,552
Don‘t eat!
Why?

973
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,115
The crumbs go down
in the upholstery.

974
00:48:29,188 --> 00:48:30,497
You‘ll never get it out.

975
00:48:30,565 --> 00:48:32,834
The car will look like
the bottom of a bird cage.

976
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:34,046
Isn‘t that crazy?

977
00:48:34,117 --> 00:48:35,229
I’m starving.

978
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,510
One loaf of French bread

979
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,002
and the resale value
goes down $500.

980
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:42,141
You wanna eat a $500 sandwich.
it‘s up to you.

981
00:48:42,372 --> 00:48:44,510
How about if
I just eat the insides for $1?

982
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:02,202
Can you make it?

983
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:03,900
Claudia.
once we find our kids.

984
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:05,432
why don‘t you and Danny
drop us off?

985
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:07,197
Then you can go see Mike
at Wesley.

986
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:09,175
We‘ll see him tomorrow.
It’s Saturday night.

987
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,006
He‘s probably out
trying to get laid.

988
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:14,423
What makes you think
your son‘s always doing
something sexual?

989
00:49:14,498 --> 00:49:16,156
Please. I’m Italian.

990
00:49:16,226 --> 00:49:17,535
Hi! There she is!

991
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,064
Bethie!

992
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,471
Hi. guys.

993
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:22,781
Hi!

994
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:25,088
God. you look marvelous.

995
00:49:25,153 --> 00:49:26,200
Hi!

996
00:49:26,273 --> 00:49:27,386
Hello. honey.
Hi.

997
00:49:27,457 --> 00:49:28,766
Hello.
Hi.

998
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:30,647
Lisa‘s down there
somewhere.

999
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:31,736
Where?

1000
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:33,303
Down there.
Come on. I’ll show you.

1001
00:49:33,377 --> 00:49:35,352
Guess what?
I got an ‘‘A‘‘ in History.

1002
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:38,750
And this teacher
is such a jerk.
you wouldn‘t believe it.

1003
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:40,726
He wouldn‘t even tell us
what to write about.

1004
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:42,710
I had to figure
the whole thing out by myself.

1005
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:45,205
You don‘t think
he was trying to get you
to think for yourself?

1006
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,873
No. Mom. no.
This guy is really a jerk.

1007
00:49:46,944 --> 00:49:49,726
lf the jerks had
their own country.
this guy would be president.

1008
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:53,023
There she is.
Lisa! Lis!

1009
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:54,811
I’ll--I’ll go get her.
Hold on. will you?

1010
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,862
Wait right there.

1011
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:56,863
Okay.

1012
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,421
Oh. God.
she‘s wonderful.

1013
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,862
That kid sure takes
a real bite out of life.

1014
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,578
Hi ya. babe.

1015
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,727
Hi. Dad.

1016
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,839
Hi. You look great.

1017
00:50:07,615 --> 00:50:08,662
Hi. Lisa.

1018
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:09,782
Hi.

1019
00:50:09,855 --> 00:50:11,416
Hi. Lisa.
Hi.

1020
00:50:11,487 --> 00:50:12,534
It’s good to
see you again.

1021
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,013
Hi. Lisa.
Hi.

1022
00:50:14,622 --> 00:50:15,800
Doesn‘t she look good?

1023
00:50:15,871 --> 00:50:17,562
Oh. you look terrific.
Just great.

1024
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:18,841
Thanks.

1025
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,397
Oh.
I have a present for you.

1026
00:50:21,471 --> 00:50:22,550
Right.

1027
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:24,116
Yeah.
I’ll--I’ll go get it. Okay?

1028
00:50:25,246 --> 00:50:27,635
So.
you‘re getting enough sleep.
and food and everything?

1029
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:28,790
You look just great.

1030
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:29,909
Thanks.

1031
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,354
Can you have
lunch with us now?

1032
00:50:31,422 --> 00:50:33,277
We‘re gonna have
lunch at the Inn. okay?

1033
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:35,098
Sure.
You got a ride
over there. right?

1034
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,660
Yeah. I’m going
with Beth in her car.

1035
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,392
You know the way?
Yeah. yeah. of course.

1036
00:50:38,461 --> 00:50:41,308
There‘s a return slip.
if it‘s the wrong
size or anything.

1037
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:42,421
Thank you.

1038
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:43,475
See you later. Lisa.

1039
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:45,524
Okay. we‘ll see you later.
Bye-bye.

1040
00:50:45,597 --> 00:50:46,709
See you later. girls.

1041
00:50:46,781 --> 00:50:48,123
Bye-bye.

1042
00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:50,069
Oh. boy.
does she look great.

1043
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,148
You don‘t think she looked
a little depressed?

1044
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,169
Who? You mean Lisa?

1045
00:50:53,245 --> 00:50:54,172
Yeah. Lisa.

1046
00:50:54,236 --> 00:50:56,091
No. no. no. no.
She has a slow metabolism.

1047
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:57,945
That‘s up. She‘s up today.

1048
00:50:58,492 --> 00:51:00,434
Maybe you should
have a talk with her.

1049
00:51:00,508 --> 00:51:01,850
What‘s the matter
with you people?

1050
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:03,476
I tell you.
the kid is a survivor.

1051
00:51:03,548 --> 00:51:05,304
Just a little talk.

1052
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:07,191
It‘ll make her
feel so much better.

1053
00:51:09,372 --> 00:51:10,517
Okay.

1054
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:27,124
Do you lock it now or what?

1055
00:51:27,195 --> 00:51:28,951
You wanna hang
onto your purse?
No.

1056
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,480
Got your purse.

1057
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,592
This is<i>...</i>

1058
00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:40,121
Did you know Anne
is here this weekend?

1059
00:51:40,186 --> 00:51:41,975
Anne is here?
Oh. no.

1060
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:43,416
Are you sure?
Beth told me.

1061
00:51:43,481 --> 00:51:45,074
My God.
how did that happen?

1062
00:51:46,265 --> 00:51:48,054
Anne‘s grown up.
She can take it.

1063
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:49,944
What makes you think
we can?

1064
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:51,667
Did you know
she was coming?

1065
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:53,046
When I talked to her
Tuesday.

1066
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,001
she said she was gonna
work it out with Nick.

1067
00:51:55,065 --> 00:51:57,170
I called her when we said
we were coming up here

1068
00:51:57,241 --> 00:51:58,451
just so this
wouldn‘t happen.

1069
00:51:58,521 --> 00:51:59,568
Well. I don‘t understand.

1070
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:01,746
Nick. you didn‘t tell her
you were coming with Ginny

1071
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:02,711
and she didn‘t tell you?

1072
00:52:02,777 --> 00:52:05,559
I don‘t know.
She might have mentioned
she was thinking of it.

1073
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:08,439
She never does
what she says she‘s gonna do.
She‘s unreliable.

1074
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:09,998
I don‘t listen to
her half the time.

1075
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:12,014
That might be
a small problem right there.

1076
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,975
You know. I don‘t
wanna talk her down

1077
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,829
but she is
unreliable.

1078
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:17,652
I mean.
Nick has made
three appointments

1079
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,313
to meet her down
at his lawyer‘s office

1080
00:52:19,384 --> 00:52:20,496
and she‘s never
shown up.

1081
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:21,777
She hasn‘t
even called.

1082
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,374
Now. wait a minute.

1083
00:52:23,447 --> 00:52:26,382
No offense. Ginny.
but 21 years ago
Nick said he would be there

1084
00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:29,772
on the other side of
the bed every morning
and for the last six months

1085
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,952
he hasn‘t kept his
appointment. either!

1086
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,479
Okay. uh. look--look.
let‘s calm down.

1087
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,973
It’s not all that bad.
It’s just
a little embarrassing.

1088
00:52:37,046 --> 00:52:38,705
I don‘t see what
the big problem is.

1089
00:52:38,775 --> 00:52:40,367
We‘re all adults.

1090
00:52:41,015 --> 00:52:42,738
We‘ll just say ‘‘Hello.‘‘
and. uh<i>...</i>

1091
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:44,781
Have a nervous
breakdown.

1092
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:48,692
Ginny. I’m sorry.

1093
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,175
The--the-- This--
there is a lot of strain
on the situation

1094
00:52:52,245 --> 00:52:53,554
and I get
passionate sometimes.

1095
00:52:53,622 --> 00:52:54,636
That‘s okay.

1096
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,612
I know you‘re just trying
to be fair to everybody.

1097
00:52:58,613 --> 00:53:01,133
You‘re the one
I wanted to make cry.

1098
00:53:03,285 --> 00:53:05,358
Why do you have to
open up your mouth again?

1099
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,403
Danny. it‘s over
and done with. please.
Come on.

1100
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:09,135
Let‘s have a nice
quiet time. just once.

1101
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:11,507
We‘re gonna have<i>...</i>
All right.
let‘s get a move on.

1102
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:14,035
Shh.
Please. not now.

1103
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:16,492
Hey. you okay?
Yeah.

1104
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:18,288
You sure?
I’m okay.

1105
00:53:20,212 --> 00:53:22,514
Do you have a reservation
for Callan. please?

1106
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,336
You‘re all registered.
Mr. Callan.

1107
00:53:25,556 --> 00:53:26,963
I’m all registered?

1108
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:29,002
Mrs. Callan checked
in a few minutes ago.

1109
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,053
Everything
all right?

1110
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:36,553
Oh. yeah.
everything‘s terrific.

1111
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:37,740
Do we have
our rooms?

1112
00:53:37,812 --> 00:53:38,760
Wait a minute.

1113
00:53:38,835 --> 00:53:41,518
Uh. could I see you over here
for a minute. please?

1114
00:53:41,587 --> 00:53:43,594
Could I see you over here
for a minute. please?

1115
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:44,938
What‘s the matter?

1116
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:48,271
As far as I can make out.

1117
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:50,608
Anne has just
checked into our room.

1118
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,881
Oh. no. I knew it.
Oh. my God.

1119
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:55,694
Look. we can just
go someplace else.

1120
00:53:55,762 --> 00:53:57,006
On Parents‘ Weekend.

1121
00:53:57,074 --> 00:53:59,114
everything‘s booked
within 50 miles of here.

1122
00:53:59,186 --> 00:54:01,008
Well. then I’ll sleep
in the car.

1123
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:03,212
I could sit up
all night in the diner.

1124
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:06,893
Maybe the earth will just
open up and swallow me.

1125
00:54:08,722 --> 00:54:10,129
Hi. everybody.

1126
00:54:10,194 --> 00:54:11,088
Hi.

1127
00:54:11,154 --> 00:54:13,292
Hi.

1128
00:54:13,553 --> 00:54:14,568
Hi. How are you?

1129
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:15,624
I’m fine.

1130
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,744
Oh. that‘s a nice kiss.

1131
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:19,532
This is wonderful.

1132
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:21,609
You look gorgeous.

1133
00:54:21,681 --> 00:54:22,728
Thank you.

1134
00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:25,103
It’s great
to see you.

1135
00:54:25,872 --> 00:54:27,596
Uh. hi.

1136
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:35,370
Did you see Lisa?
No. I haven‘t yet.

1137
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,295
Oh. she looks terrific.
She does?

1138
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,302
Oh. yeah.
Oh. good. I miss her.

1139
00:54:43,888 --> 00:54:45,132
Hi. I’m Ginny.

1140
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,760
Oh. this is Ginny Newley.

1141
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:49,613
How do you do? l--
We‘ve spoken on the phone.
I believe.

1142
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:51,337
Yes. l--I think
we have.

1143
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:55,022
Okay. I got that
taken care of.

1144
00:54:56,623 --> 00:54:58,117
Oh. hi. Anne. how are you?

1145
00:54:58,191 --> 00:55:00,613
Fine. Nick. I’m fine.
How are you?

1146
00:55:00,686 --> 00:55:01,996
I’m fine.

1147
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:06,663
Well. now that we all
know we‘re fine.

1148
00:55:06,735 --> 00:55:08,677
is there anything else
we ought to talk about?

1149
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:12,427
Jack. don‘t. uh. don‘t try to
get to the heart of things.

1150
00:55:12,495 --> 00:55:14,317
just let it lay there.

1151
00:55:14,766 --> 00:55:16,806
Why are we all pretending
we‘re not embarrassed?

1152
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:18,733
Why don‘t we just
say how we feel?

1153
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:22,114
I feel. uh. like I wish you
would just sort of shut up.

1154
00:55:25,037 --> 00:55:26,247
Okay.

1155
00:55:26,317 --> 00:55:27,878
Lisa‘s on her way
over here.

1156
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,476
I’m gonna have
lunch with her. okay?

1157
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:32,549
Okay.
I’ll--I’ll have
dinner with her.

1158
00:55:32,973 --> 00:55:33,867
Fine.

1159
00:55:33,933 --> 00:55:34,826
Fine.

1160
00:55:35,501 --> 00:55:37,224
More fine. good.
That‘s great.

1161
00:55:38,093 --> 00:55:39,140
Hmm.

1162
00:55:39,788 --> 00:55:42,635
Listen. it‘s lovely to
see you all. It really is.

1163
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,227
Okay. goodbye.

1164
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,056
Talk to you later. honey.
Take care.

1165
00:55:46,124 --> 00:55:47,401
It was very nice
to meet you.

1166
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:49,481
Of course.
Thank you. Miss Newley.

1167
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,906
See. what was
wrong with that?

1168
00:55:57,996 --> 00:55:59,337
Claudia. come on.

1169
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:01,291
Do you have my room?
Dr. Zimmer?

1170
00:56:01,355 --> 00:56:03,810
There won‘t be any more
Zimmers coming in. will there?

1171
00:56:03,883 --> 00:56:05,443
Better not be.

1172
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:09,123
Anne? Hold on.
Wait a second. huh?

1173
00:56:09,323 --> 00:56:10,272
Anne.

1174
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:14,152
God. that must‘ve been
murder for you in there.

1175
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:15,364
I’ll get used to it.

1176
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:17,988
Shall we talk?
I have a feeling
we should talk.

1177
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:20,840
Well. uh<i>...</i>

1178
00:56:24,554 --> 00:56:26,975
Actually I have the feeling

1179
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,959
that. um.
you‘re all deserting me.

1180
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:30,016
Deserting you?

1181
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,072
Yes.

1182
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,308
You had that. uh. party
on Labor Day

1183
00:56:34,761 --> 00:56:36,801
and you asked
Nick but not me.

1184
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:39,240
Anne! That‘s because
he was with her.

1185
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:41,890
We couldn‘t invite you both
to the same party.

1186
00:56:41,961 --> 00:56:43,303
We would‘ve been
nervous wrecks.

1187
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:44,995
Anne. we love you.

1188
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:48,097
Uh. look. next week why
don‘t we have dinner?

1189
00:56:48,169 --> 00:56:49,991
We‘ll--we‘ll go see
a movie. Huh?

1190
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,035
Good. I would like that.

1191
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:53,730
You know.
you‘re right. it‘s true.

1192
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:55,655
We‘ve talked to you
on the phone a few times

1193
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,575
but in the last
couple of months.

1194
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,844
we have let you
drift out of our lives.

1195
00:57:00,776 --> 00:57:02,237
Has it been really tough?

1196
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:05,859
Not bad.

1197
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:09,156
Actually. um.
it‘s been pure shit.

1198
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:12,199
But it could be worse.

1199
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:13,700
How do you get
through the day?

1200
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:14,912
I work.

1201
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:17,632
But I tend to. uh.
lose track.

1202
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:20,989
I get on the bus
and I forget where I’m going

1203
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,365
and I watch the streets go by

1204
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:25,532
and I just hope to God

1205
00:57:25,607 --> 00:57:28,257
that one of them will
remind me what I’m there for.

1206
00:57:29,255 --> 00:57:31,589
Oh. it‘s not
as bad as all that.

1207
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:35,457
I’ve been trying to
get out of my rut.

1208
00:57:36,774 --> 00:57:38,203
I am thinking

1209
00:57:38,918 --> 00:57:41,568
about. uh. uh. going
to Czechoslovakia.

1210
00:57:42,661 --> 00:57:43,610
Why?

1211
00:57:43,782 --> 00:57:46,945
Because I’ve never wanted
to go to Czechoslovakia.

1212
00:57:47,238 --> 00:57:49,441
And it‘s something new.

1213
00:57:49,637 --> 00:57:53,379
and I’m trying very hard.
you know. to be less. uh.
what. uh. compulsive.

1214
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:55,970
To be a little bit
more spontaneous.

1215
00:57:57,061 --> 00:57:58,849
Last week. I bought a snake.

1216
00:58:00,965 --> 00:58:02,077
You bought a snake?

1217
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:04,669
It felt kind of strange
at first. but. uh.

1218
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:07,615
once you get used to him.
he‘s lovely. He‘s lovely.

1219
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:08,895
He‘s a nice pet.

1220
00:58:09,508 --> 00:58:10,937
Yeah?
Yeah.

1221
00:58:11,076 --> 00:58:14,688
He‘s disgusting to start with
because he eats mice alive.

1222
00:58:17,348 --> 00:58:19,769
You‘ve really been through
the wringer. haven‘t you?

1223
00:58:21,892 --> 00:58:24,128
Uh. I’m all right.
I really am all right.

1224
00:58:24,195 --> 00:58:27,511
In fact. in some ways I think
I’m stronger than ever.

1225
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,562
The only thing is that

1226
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:32,570
every time I think about
going to Czechoslovakia

1227
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:34,498
I. uh. I start to cry.

1228
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:42,971
I’ll--I’lI stop by
for Lisa later.

1229
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:45,595
And we‘re gonna
call you Monday
for dinner. okay?

1230
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:46,844
Okay.
Anne?

1231
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:47,929
What?

1232
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:49,311
Will you call me
at the office?

1233
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:51,483
Because I think I can
get an assignment for you.

1234
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,657
I love you.

1235
00:58:55,457 --> 00:58:56,766
Do me a favor

1236
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,321
and don‘t tell Nick
about the snake. all right?

1237
00:58:59,394 --> 00:59:00,441
No.

1238
00:59:00,513 --> 00:59:02,236
He thinks I’m crazy
as it is.

1239
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:11,479
I’ll tell you what.

1240
00:59:12,865 --> 00:59:14,174
To hell with Nick.

1241
00:59:14,337 --> 00:59:17,184
Tell him. uh. it‘s
a goddamn boa constrictor.

1242
00:59:25,984 --> 00:59:27,478
I don‘t understand him.

1243
00:59:27,552 --> 00:59:29,078
How could he do that
to her?

1244
00:59:29,152 --> 00:59:31,454
He‘s got a long history
of doing that to her.

1245
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,935
He‘s been having affairs
with other women all along.
Dozens!

1246
00:59:35,008 --> 00:59:36,185
Oh. you‘re kidding.

1247
00:59:36,255 --> 00:59:37,564
How could you not know?

1248
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:41,178
They even slept
at your apartment once.

1249
00:59:41,247 --> 00:59:42,262
Where was l?

1250
00:59:42,335 --> 00:59:44,507
You gave him your keys
so he could feed your cat

1251
00:59:44,575 --> 00:59:47,444
and water your plants
when you went away
for the weekend.

1252
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:50,491
Didn‘t you notice the funny
look on the cat‘s face

1253
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,803
when you came home?

1254
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:53,395
That son of a bitch.

1255
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,184
He told you all this?

1256
00:59:56,254 --> 00:59:57,596
He told me
some of it.

1257
00:59:57,918 --> 01:00:00,252
Some of it came out
when he was under gas.

1258
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:01,496
I don‘t know.

1259
01:00:01,566 --> 01:00:02,678
Jeez!

1260
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,855
I’ve lost all my illusions
about that guy.

1261
01:00:04,925 --> 01:00:07,478
Every time I think about him
I get angry and depressed.

1262
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,979
I just can‘t
believe that of him.

1263
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:11,290
Ah. maybe it‘s this
time of the year.

1264
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,983
Always hated autumn.

1265
01:00:13,117 --> 01:00:14,677
Everybody says
it‘s so beautiful

1266
01:00:14,749 --> 01:00:17,618
but for me it‘s just--just
another time of death.

1267
01:00:17,693 --> 01:00:19,635
I always get psoriasis
in autumn.

1268
01:00:19,709 --> 01:00:22,458
Danny. believe me.
you‘re not gonna die
from psoriasis.

1269
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:25,497
What‘s that
supposed to mean?

1270
01:00:25,565 --> 01:00:27,931
I’m just trying
to comfort you.
Don‘t get paranoid.

1271
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,456
How come everyone
thinks I’m paranoid?

1272
01:00:31,197 --> 01:00:33,204
You discuss this
behind my back. don‘t you?

1273
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:34,967
Danny. relax. would you?

1274
01:00:35,037 --> 01:00:36,825
Come on. come on.
I’m sorry.

1275
01:00:38,204 --> 01:00:40,692
lf you could just realize
what a terrific person you are

1276
01:00:40,764 --> 01:00:42,836
you wouldn‘t think
everybody was out to get you.

1277
01:00:42,908 --> 01:00:44,184
Don‘t try to
analyze me. okay?

1278
01:00:44,251 --> 01:00:45,462
First.
I’m not your patient.

1279
01:00:45,532 --> 01:00:46,677
Second.
you‘re not a doctor.

1280
01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:47,958
I’m just trying to help.

1281
01:00:48,027 --> 01:00:49,849
You‘re not helping.
you‘re patronizing me.

1282
01:00:49,915 --> 01:00:50,995
So cut it out. okay?
Okay. Okay.

1283
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:52,343
Don‘t--don‘t get
so overwrought.

1284
01:00:52,412 --> 01:00:53,655
What can I do for you?

1285
01:00:53,723 --> 01:00:56,025
First of all.
you can take your arm
off my shoulder

1286
01:00:56,091 --> 01:00:57,684
and stick it
up your ass.

1287
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:05,976
Look. sweetheart.
I know what
you‘re going through.

1288
01:01:06,043 --> 01:01:07,952
My parents separated
when I was a kid. too.

1289
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:09,783
I hated them for it.

1290
01:01:11,098 --> 01:01:13,040
I promised myself
that when I grew up

1291
01:01:13,114 --> 01:01:15,983
I’d remember what it was like
and never do that
to one of mine.

1292
01:01:17,114 --> 01:01:19,983
Trouble is. now I see
it from the other side.

1293
01:01:20,825 --> 01:01:23,192
But you‘ve very mature
for your age.
You‘re resilient.

1294
01:01:23,257 --> 01:01:26,007
This will pass
and in no time you‘ll be
singing and laughing.

1295
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:28,630
Believe me.
you‘re gonna be laughing.

1296
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:38,612
Look. your entire world
doesn‘t revolve around me.

1297
01:01:38,681 --> 01:01:40,503
You‘ve got your
own life to live.

1298
01:01:40,568 --> 01:01:42,510
You‘ve made some friends
at your dorm. right?

1299
01:01:42,585 --> 01:01:43,795
Not really.

1300
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,389
Most of the people
I’ve met here

1301
01:01:45,465 --> 01:01:47,123
have a peculiar idea
of a good time.

1302
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:48,239
Like what?

1303
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:52,209
They get drunk
and piss off the balconies.

1304
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,785
What about the girls?

1305
01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:58,710
I’m talking about the girls.

1306
01:02:00,727 --> 01:02:02,287
You‘re kidding me. right?

1307
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:03,701
I’m kidding you?

1308
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:05,490
You think it‘s a joke
to have to walk home

1309
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:07,926
on a clear night
with an umbrella?

1310
01:02:11,703 --> 01:02:13,012
Haven‘t you got
any friends here?

1311
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:14,158
They don‘t interest me.

1312
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,335
Oh. come on.
There must be somebody.

1313
01:02:16,535 --> 01:02:17,582
Hey!

1314
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:20,725
What about that
kid from. uh. Ohio?

1315
01:02:20,983 --> 01:02:22,870
Yeah. Marilyn Oupenski.

1316
01:02:22,934 --> 01:02:24,494
Yeah.
She was great.

1317
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:27,054
She was a lot like me.
A lot like me.

1318
01:02:28,022 --> 01:02:29,680
Her parents made her go home.

1319
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,764
Why?

1320
01:02:31,253 --> 01:02:33,293
She tried to swallow
a bottle of pills.

1321
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:36,651
Why didn‘t you tell me?

1322
01:02:36,725 --> 01:02:37,936
What for?

1323
01:02:38,006 --> 01:02:40,558
Lisa. if the one person
you identify with
in this place

1324
01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:42,353
happens to swallow
a bottle of pills

1325
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:44,177
don‘t you think
I’d be mildly interested?

1326
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:45,772
You keep making
all these decisions

1327
01:02:45,844 --> 01:02:47,732
that affect my life
without asking me.

1328
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,390
That doesn‘t seem
to bother you.

1329
01:02:51,316 --> 01:02:53,934
You know what this is?
This is emotional blackmail.

1330
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:56,754
I’m trying to appeal
to your sense of intelligence
and maturity

1331
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,984
you sit there like
the Bride of Frankenstein
talking about suicide.

1332
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:10,447
Come on. sweetheart.

1333
01:03:12,115 --> 01:03:14,384
You‘re not as morose as
all that and you know it.

1334
01:03:14,451 --> 01:03:16,818
You got a great big smile
down there somewhere

1335
01:03:16,883 --> 01:03:18,410
and you just won‘t let it out.

1336
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,005
Come on. give in.

1337
01:03:22,322 --> 01:03:24,427
Let‘s have a nice big smile.

1338
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,922
I know you got one
in there.

1339
01:03:27,986 --> 01:03:31,052
I can see it sitting there.
dying to come out.

1340
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:34,728
Here it comes.

1341
01:03:34,802 --> 01:03:37,801
I can see it curling up
at the corner of your mouth.

1342
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:39,593
Come on. here it comes.

1343
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:41,040
Here comes the smile.

1344
01:03:41,169 --> 01:03:42,860
Smile. Goddamn it!

1345
01:03:47,953 --> 01:03:49,480
All right. don‘t.

1346
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:55,271
<i>I think you should</i>
<i>apologize to her.</i>

1347
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:56,360
For what?

1348
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:57,993
I got excited.
I spoke my mind

1349
01:03:58,065 --> 01:04:00,072
I said I was sorry
and it‘s over and done with.

1350
01:04:00,145 --> 01:04:02,054
I don‘t understand
how you can hurt someone

1351
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,617
as guileless
and vulnerable as Ginny.

1352
01:04:05,744 --> 01:04:07,981
She sure took on
a lot of mystical qualities

1353
01:04:08,048 --> 01:04:09,706
once you saw her
swimming naked.

1354
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,306
How can you say that?

1355
01:04:11,377 --> 01:04:13,318
I just say what I think.
Mmm-hmm.

1356
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:15,531
Well.
maybe that‘s the problem.

1357
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,534
Why do you always have to say
what you think?

1358
01:04:18,704 --> 01:04:21,573
You think your thoughts
should just fall down
from your brain

1359
01:04:21,647 --> 01:04:23,786
onto your tongue
like a gumball machine!

1360
01:04:23,856 --> 01:04:26,245
Danny. I am not gonna
start watching what I think

1361
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,392
or what I feel!
I am Italian!

1362
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:29,510
I know you‘re Italian!

1363
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,852
I don‘t wanna hear any more
how you‘re Italian!

1364
01:04:31,919 --> 01:04:33,261
Wait. Wait. here.

1365
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,149
Wait.
Just wait. wait. wait.

1366
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:38,822
Hello out there!
This woman is Italian!

1367
01:04:39,694 --> 01:04:41,036
All right!

1368
01:04:41,262 --> 01:04:42,888
You no longer
have to announce

1369
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:44,518
your ethnic origin
in this state!

1370
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:47,045
Everybody in Connecticut
knows you‘re Italian!

1371
01:04:47,118 --> 01:04:48,547
And when we cross the border.

1372
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:50,825
I’ll take out an ad
in the <i>New York Times.</i>

1373
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:59,300
What‘s with him?

1374
01:04:59,374 --> 01:05:00,868
I don‘t know.

1375
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:03,305
What‘s with you?

1376
01:05:04,621 --> 01:05:07,010
I’m sorry. I just feel
very let down by you.

1377
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:08,459
Why? What have l
done to you?

1378
01:05:08,524 --> 01:05:10,663
What is your idea of a close
intimate friendship?

1379
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:11,943
What does that mean to you?

1380
01:05:12,012 --> 01:05:13,190
I don‘t understand.

1381
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:14,570
I’ve hurt you in some way?

1382
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:17,644
I happen to know you betrayed
your wife dozens of times.

1383
01:05:20,748 --> 01:05:23,431
lf I did. that‘s what
I did to her.
What did I do to you?

1384
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,223
You didn‘t tell
either of us.

1385
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:26,786
Hey. wait a minute.

1386
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,866
Let‘s take you
one at a time.

1387
01:05:28,939 --> 01:05:30,881
You can understand
my not telling her. right?

1388
01:05:30,955 --> 01:05:32,897
I can‘t understand you
saying on the one hand

1389
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:34,281
that you could
tell me anything.

1390
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,991
And on the other hand
not telling me a goddamn thing
except what suits you.

1391
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,001
I feel as betrayed
as she does.

1392
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:42,690
Jack. all I’ve ever
gotten from you

1393
01:05:42,763 --> 01:05:44,105
is judgment and disapproval.

1394
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:45,633
You expect me to come
and tell you

1395
01:05:45,706 --> 01:05:47,845
every time I’ve had an affair
with a hatcheck girl?

1396
01:05:47,915 --> 01:05:49,606
That‘s who you were
having affairs with?

1397
01:05:49,675 --> 01:05:50,568
Hatcheck girls?

1398
01:05:50,635 --> 01:05:51,714
No!

1399
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:54,656
They were all intelligent.
worthy women.
The top in their field.

1400
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:55,843
I can‘t tell you their names

1401
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:58,532
but two of them were
Margaret Thatcher
and Indira Gandhi.

1402
01:05:58,762 --> 01:06:00,420
When you wanna talk
intelligently. I’ll talk.

1403
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,148
Otherwise. forget it.

1404
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,734
When did you
get this?

1405
01:06:05,802 --> 01:06:07,111
Couple of weeks ago.

1406
01:06:07,178 --> 01:06:08,520
Do you have any
good friends here?

1407
01:06:08,586 --> 01:06:09,993
Mmm-hmm.
I like this.

1408
01:06:10,602 --> 01:06:11,911
Who are your friends?

1409
01:06:11,978 --> 01:06:13,025
People.

1410
01:06:13,097 --> 01:06:14,079
Good.

1411
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:16,230
What about Lisa?

1412
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:17,926
Forget it.

1413
01:06:18,153 --> 01:06:19,462
When you were
in high school

1414
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:21,700
you were on the phone
with her almost every night.

1415
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:22,784
Not anymore.

1416
01:06:22,857 --> 01:06:23,839
What‘s the problem?

1417
01:06:24,201 --> 01:06:26,208
She‘s such a bitch
sometimes!

1418
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:29,477
Sh-she just gets<i>...</i>
I don‘t know.

1419
01:06:29,545 --> 01:06:31,333
She says
she‘ll meet me someplace

1420
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,545
and she doesn‘t show up.

1421
01:06:32,616 --> 01:06:34,372
Sometimes she‘ll just
sit there for an hour

1422
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,585
without talking.

1423
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,221
It’s like she‘s
trying to test me

1424
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:38,717
and see how much
shit I’ll take.

1425
01:06:39,048 --> 01:06:40,128
She probably is.

1426
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,444
I hate it!

1427
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,578
Hey. babe. come here.

1428
01:06:49,287 --> 01:06:50,564
What if. uh.

1429
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:54,849
what if you just accepted her
for what she is. huh?

1430
01:06:54,919 --> 01:06:56,097
I do.

1431
01:06:56,231 --> 01:06:58,020
Trouble is. what she is.
is a bitch.

1432
01:06:58,119 --> 01:06:59,067
Oh.

1433
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:01,217
When she acts like that.
maybe you--

1434
01:07:01,287 --> 01:07:02,716
maybe you could
just laugh at her.

1435
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,700
You know. like she was
a character in a story.

1436
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:05,702
Mom. that‘s impossible.

1437
01:07:05,766 --> 01:07:06,660
Why?

1438
01:07:06,726 --> 01:07:09,312
Because it is. Forget it.
Change the subject.

1439
01:07:10,406 --> 01:07:11,551
Okay.

1440
01:07:13,702 --> 01:07:14,880
What other friends
do you have?

1441
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:18,245
Oh. stop it! Be quiet!
Time to stop talking now!

1442
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:20,449
I’m closing off your breath!
Here we go!

1443
01:07:20,934 --> 01:07:22,308
This is so good.

1444
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:24,795
Mmm. I hope
this is homemade.

1445
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,204
Just look at all
those calories.

1446
01:07:28,069 --> 01:07:29,498
Do you want
a bite?

1447
01:07:29,573 --> 01:07:31,035
Oh. God. I got
too much in my mouth.

1448
01:07:31,908 --> 01:07:32,988
Thank you.

1449
01:07:33,093 --> 01:07:34,751
You are
such a slob.

1450
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:37,636
Okay.
That‘s $23 from Nick

1451
01:07:37,701 --> 01:07:40,286
$24.50 from Jack
and $16 from me

1452
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,331
But let‘s split it
three ways.

1453
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:44,227
Then why tell us
what everybody spent?

1454
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:46,659
Because if there‘s
a discrepancy
in anyone‘s share

1455
01:07:46,724 --> 01:07:48,447
it will benefit
everyone to know about it.

1456
01:07:48,516 --> 01:07:50,971
How can I know
what my share was unless
I compulsively added up

1457
01:07:51,044 --> 01:07:52,451
my bill the whole time
I was eating?

1458
01:07:52,516 --> 01:07:54,938
Oh.
now I’m compulsive.

1459
01:07:55,011 --> 01:07:56,604
10 minutes ago.
I was paranoid.

1460
01:07:56,675 --> 01:07:58,202
Give me the check.
I’ll pay it.

1461
01:07:58,276 --> 01:08:01,887
I’m sorry. I’m not a member of
the Million Dollar Roundtable.

1462
01:08:02,435 --> 01:08:04,769
You want the check?
Here. you got it.

1463
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:07,104
Come on.
you‘re a successful dentist.

1464
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:08,099
That‘s right.

1465
01:08:08,163 --> 01:08:10,268
And this is a checkup
and cleaning.

1466
01:08:10,339 --> 01:08:12,411
Takes me a long time
to scrape. polish.

1467
01:08:12,482 --> 01:08:13,791
and poke to make this.

1468
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:15,647
Hey. Danny. calm down.

1469
01:08:15,714 --> 01:08:17,088
Please don‘t tell
me to calm down.

1470
01:08:17,154 --> 01:08:19,805
This is the second time today
somebody‘s told me
to calm down.

1471
01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:21,849
I’m sorry.
it‘s only my first.

1472
01:08:21,923 --> 01:08:23,962
lf he wants to keep the books.
let him keep them.

1473
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:25,245
I don‘t want to
keep the books.

1474
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:26,459
I’ll pay the check.

1475
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:27,936
Again. I am not upset.

1476
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:28,929
Don‘t get upset.

1477
01:08:28,994 --> 01:08:30,620
I told you.
I was not upset.

1478
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:31,900
Here. take the check.

1479
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,239
I don‘t want the check.
I’m not upset.

1480
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:36,056
Don‘t get him upset.
will you?

1481
01:08:36,129 --> 01:08:38,268
I didn‘t get him upset!
You got him upset.

1482
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:39,996
I told you.
I’m not upset.

1483
01:08:40,065 --> 01:08:41,723
This is ridiculous.
Why do you<i>...</i>

1484
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,270
Oh. God.

1485
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:41,717
Oh. God.

1486
01:10:43,514 --> 01:10:45,587
It really took off
a lot of skin.

1487
01:10:49,786 --> 01:10:50,898
What are you doing?

1488
01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:53,686
I’ve been out in the cold
all day and my skin is dry.

1489
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:57,682
I wonder if they have
any ice down the hall.

1490
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,826
Gee. I don‘t know.
Why don‘t you go see?

1491
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:02,674
Are you mad at me?

1492
01:11:02,745 --> 01:11:03,727
You got it.

1493
01:11:05,593 --> 01:11:07,600
You picked a hell of
a time to get irrational.

1494
01:11:07,673 --> 01:11:10,291
Oh. I’m not irrational.
Rational people get angry!

1495
01:11:10,361 --> 01:11:12,466
irrational people
pretend they don‘t.

1496
01:11:12,537 --> 01:11:14,130
Okay.
just stop it right there!

1497
01:11:14,201 --> 01:11:16,656
I have a very bad temper!
Don‘t make me use it!

1498
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:17,677
Use it.

1499
01:11:17,752 --> 01:11:20,403
I don‘t happen to think
there‘s anything
wrong with anger.

1500
01:11:20,825 --> 01:11:22,897
I’m going to be
very calm about this.

1501
01:11:22,968 --> 01:11:24,113
Why do you resent me?

1502
01:11:24,184 --> 01:11:26,039
Because when you fight
you get calm.

1503
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:27,413
You don‘t like that?

1504
01:11:27,544 --> 01:11:28,886
It drives me nuts.

1505
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,175
I also don‘t
like having to guess
your every need

1506
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,873
when you don‘t give
a damn about mine.

1507
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:35,438
I don‘t like that a lot!

1508
01:11:35,511 --> 01:11:37,878
What needs do you have
that I don‘t give
a damn about?

1509
01:11:37,943 --> 01:11:40,878
Don‘t you ever feel
like going someplace
alone with me?

1510
01:11:41,271 --> 01:11:43,126
You want to take
a vacation without them?

1511
01:11:43,415 --> 01:11:46,448
I have this perverse desire
to be married to
one person at a time.

1512
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:48,079
I don‘t know. it excites me!

1513
01:11:48,151 --> 01:11:49,874
I thought--I thought
you liked them.

1514
01:11:49,942 --> 01:11:53,291
I adore them.
but it‘s getting so
I can‘t breathe!

1515
01:11:53,974 --> 01:11:56,363
Anne doesn‘t know
how lucky she is to be out!

1516
01:11:56,439 --> 01:11:57,813
You know.

1517
01:11:57,911 --> 01:11:59,853
Danny probably has
his ear pressed

1518
01:11:59,926 --> 01:12:01,814
to that door listening
to everything.

1519
01:12:03,606 --> 01:12:04,621
Danny dear.

1520
01:12:04,693 --> 01:12:07,148
please don‘t be offended.
You know how fond I am of you

1521
01:12:07,221 --> 01:12:09,229
but I think your
Mercedes sucks.

1522
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:11,568
You the one who
organizes these trips.

1523
01:12:11,638 --> 01:12:13,164
And I hate it.

1524
01:12:13,237 --> 01:12:15,059
Doesn‘t it ever occur
to you that sometimes

1525
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:16,881
I’d like to be the one
with the sore knee?

1526
01:12:16,949 --> 01:12:17,997
No.

1527
01:12:18,069 --> 01:12:20,753
You handle everything
like the most efficient people
I know!

1528
01:12:20,821 --> 01:12:22,282
Uh. nobody can do
what you do.

1529
01:12:22,357 --> 01:12:23,699
My God. you‘re perfect.

1530
01:12:24,084 --> 01:12:25,808
How dare you
call me that?

1531
01:12:25,877 --> 01:12:27,338
How dare
I call you perfect?
Yes.

1532
01:12:27,413 --> 01:12:28,820
Yes. isn‘t that
what I heard?

1533
01:12:28,884 --> 01:12:31,186
What‘s wrong with perfect?
How can you get upset?

1534
01:12:31,253 --> 01:12:34,155
Because when I’m perfect.
I cease to exist!

1535
01:12:35,252 --> 01:12:37,488
Y-you don‘t have to
hug me when--when I’m low

1536
01:12:37,556 --> 01:12:39,727
or cheer me up with
a bunch of $2 daffodils.

1537
01:12:39,796 --> 01:12:41,706
I don‘t surprise
you with daffodils?

1538
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:43,568
You know I do.
You know I do.

1539
01:12:43,636 --> 01:12:45,098
When you feel like it!

1540
01:12:45,171 --> 01:12:48,019
When it makes you feel good.
but not when I need them!

1541
01:12:48,403 --> 01:12:51,469
Goddamn it!
I’m standing here bleeding!

1542
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:54,288
Blood is running down my leg
and we‘re talking
about daffodils!

1543
01:12:54,355 --> 01:12:56,907
Because I also resent you
for hurting yourself.

1544
01:12:56,978 --> 01:12:57,927
Oh. oh. oh.

1545
01:12:58,003 --> 01:12:59,726
And that‘s not irrational.
huh?

1546
01:12:59,795 --> 01:13:02,031
You think I like to see
you so jealous of Nick

1547
01:13:02,098 --> 01:13:03,691
that you have to tackle him?

1548
01:13:03,762 --> 01:13:05,802
You think that
makes me feel good?

1549
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,279
We should get to
the heart of this.

1550
01:13:10,354 --> 01:13:11,696
The heart of this

1551
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:14,217
is that you wish you had
some blonde nymph

1552
01:13:14,418 --> 01:13:15,792
adoring you like he does.

1553
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,385
So go on! Go find one!

1554
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:20,524
Christ. how long you going
to hang on to these fantasies?

1555
01:13:20,945 --> 01:13:23,466
The reality is you‘re married
to a middle-aged woman

1556
01:13:23,538 --> 01:13:25,545
with a good sense of humor
and dry skin!

1557
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:28,615
And if you don‘t like it
then go find yourself a nymph.

1558
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:30,896
Just do me the courtesy
of telling me.

1559
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:33,383
In other words.
and I mean this
in the most loving way.

1560
01:13:33,456 --> 01:13:35,212
shit.
or get off the pot!

1561
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,256
Katherine.
I’m sorry to say this.

1562
01:13:41,648 --> 01:13:43,371
What? Say it!

1563
01:13:43,664 --> 01:13:45,452
You ‘re making me furious.

1564
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,204
You‘re furious now?

1565
01:13:48,336 --> 01:13:49,580
I’m enraged.

1566
01:13:49,648 --> 01:13:52,103
How can you tell?
I can‘t see the difference!

1567
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,891
Maybe you could learn
to stamp your
foot as a signal.

1568
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,204
Look. try this!

1569
01:13:58,192 --> 01:13:59,752
Will you shut up?

1570
01:14:00,303 --> 01:14:02,059
You know how
that voice carries?

1571
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:04,069
When you‘re mad at me.
I expect to see it.

1572
01:14:04,143 --> 01:14:05,353
I don‘t want to read about it

1573
01:14:05,423 --> 01:14:07,594
two years from now
in your goddamn diary!

1574
01:14:17,518 --> 01:14:20,136
You know how our good times
together come in waves?

1575
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:23,652
Right now I would say
we were in a very deep trough.

1576
01:14:45,645 --> 01:14:46,855
Hi. guys.

1577
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:48,962
How you doing?

1578
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:49,930
Great.

1579
01:14:49,996 --> 01:14:52,484
God. is Nick sore.

1580
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:54,370
Poor guy.

1581
01:14:55,404 --> 01:14:57,793
He just loves
to be babied.

1582
01:14:59,212 --> 01:15:00,968
Think that‘s enough?

1583
01:15:01,068 --> 01:15:03,271
- Well. see you tomorrow.
- Hurry up!

1584
01:15:03,372 --> 01:15:05,706
I’m coming! Bye.

1585
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:16,200
Good night.

1586
01:16:43,463 --> 01:16:46,310
Jack! What do you say?

1587
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:54,466
Come on!
Come on!

1588
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:07,831
Oh. shit!

1589
01:19:17,117 --> 01:19:18,873
Wait right
out there.

1590
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:20,724
The doctor wants
us to wait outside.

1591
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:21,976
He really amazes me.

1592
01:19:23,453 --> 01:19:25,820
We‘ll see you
in five minutes.

1593
01:19:25,885 --> 01:19:27,892
You all right. babe?
I’ll see you around.

1594
01:19:27,965 --> 01:19:29,558
What‘s this? Crutches!

1595
01:19:29,629 --> 01:19:31,091
Crutches are havoc.

1596
01:19:32,029 --> 01:19:33,108
What‘s that?

1597
01:19:33,245 --> 01:19:34,324
What?

1598
01:19:34,396 --> 01:19:35,989
That. The limping stuff?
What is it?

1599
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,653
I got a blister.

1600
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:40,150
Excuse me.

1601
01:19:40,605 --> 01:19:41,587
Doctor?

1602
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:42,609
Ginny. I don‘t--

1603
01:19:42,684 --> 01:19:44,277
Could you look at
his leg. too. please?

1604
01:19:44,348 --> 01:19:45,689
Sure. After
we‘re finished here.

1605
01:19:45,757 --> 01:19:47,033
You can hop up
on the table.

1606
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,376
There‘s nothing
wrong with me!

1607
01:19:48,444 --> 01:19:50,810
You landed awful hard
once. I saw you.

1608
01:19:50,876 --> 01:19:52,086
Nick. I saw it. too.

1609
01:19:52,156 --> 01:19:53,847
- We saw it!
- I saw that. too.

1610
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:55,541
All right. All right.
All right.

1611
01:19:55,612 --> 01:19:57,848
You want to take an X-ray
of my foot. go ahead.

1612
01:19:57,916 --> 01:19:59,377
Take my picture.
Which one?

1613
01:20:16,442 --> 01:20:18,449
I’ll tell you the funniest
sight in the world was.

1614
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,016
It was you
going on that jump.

1615
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:21,617
You looked like
a dying turkey.

1616
01:20:24,314 --> 01:20:27,662
The arms and
the legs started to go.
I thought I would die!

1617
01:20:28,186 --> 01:20:31,666
Listen. the thing to
do is take the boat

1618
01:20:31,737 --> 01:20:33,428
from Southampton
when you‘re traveling.

1619
01:20:33,498 --> 01:20:34,643
Oh. yeah?

1620
01:20:34,714 --> 01:20:36,404
And take<i>...</i>

1621
01:20:36,601 --> 01:20:39,056
It’s climbing
a quarter of a degree an hour.

1622
01:20:39,129 --> 01:20:41,398
I’m not going out
in that cold anymore.

1623
01:20:41,785 --> 01:20:45,527
That‘s exactly half of us
felled by disaster
on our first day.

1624
01:20:45,593 --> 01:20:48,178
So what do you suppose
we should do now?

1625
01:20:48,889 --> 01:20:50,350
How about if we talk?

1626
01:20:51,192 --> 01:20:52,141
Talk?

1627
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,179
Ever since we saw
the kids up at school.
we‘ve been walking on eggs.

1628
01:20:56,248 --> 01:20:57,939
I’m gonna get coffee.
What do you mean?

1629
01:20:58,009 --> 01:21:01,205
We have dinner.
we talk about the kids.
we talk about the news

1630
01:21:01,272 --> 01:21:03,181
but we--we don‘t really talk.

1631
01:21:04,152 --> 01:21:05,232
About what?

1632
01:21:05,304 --> 01:21:06,286
About us.

1633
01:21:07,223 --> 01:21:09,940
You‘re gonna jump over me
but I think we should
clear the air.

1634
01:21:10,007 --> 01:21:11,349
Oh. no!

1635
01:21:12,663 --> 01:21:15,248
Please. some of us
aren‘t feeling too well.
do you mind?

1636
01:21:15,735 --> 01:21:18,288
We should sit down for a while
and hash this thing out.

1637
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:20,334
I’d rather have
my teeth drilled.

1638
01:21:20,503 --> 01:21:22,772
What do you want to open up
a big can of worms for?

1639
01:21:22,839 --> 01:21:24,748
Because I thought it
was worth it. Forget it.

1640
01:21:26,391 --> 01:21:27,405
All right!

1641
01:21:27,478 --> 01:21:28,940
Okay. that‘s it.

1642
01:21:34,966 --> 01:21:36,013
Did you see this?

1643
01:21:36,086 --> 01:21:37,199
I saw it.

1644
01:21:38,454 --> 01:21:39,698
Anne‘s got
pictures in it.

1645
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:40,714
Yeah.

1646
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,331
She‘s making friends.
she‘s working.
she‘s never been better.

1647
01:21:44,405 --> 01:21:46,544
And you‘ll notice.
these are pictures
of people.

1648
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:48,497
not kumquats.

1649
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:50,996
I saw it.

1650
01:21:51,733 --> 01:21:52,813
Hey. guys.

1651
01:21:53,525 --> 01:21:55,019
why don‘t we
have some fun?

1652
01:21:55,829 --> 01:21:59,025
You know that roadhouse.
about 15 miles from here?

1653
01:21:59,092 --> 01:21:59,986
Yeah?

1654
01:22:00,052 --> 01:22:02,157
They‘re going to have
music tonight. right?

1655
01:22:02,228 --> 01:22:04,432
I mean. we can‘t all dance

1656
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,834
but we could sit
and have a beer.
listen to the music.

1657
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,137
Here we go.
I’d like to get out of here.

1658
01:22:09,204 --> 01:22:12,138
I think that‘s
a swell idea.

1659
01:22:12,372 --> 01:22:14,412
I’m not against
having a good time.

1660
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,715
Let‘s have fun.

1661
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,771
Don‘t hurt yourself laughing.

1662
01:22:19,796 --> 01:22:22,381
When are you
going to forgive me
for marrying Ginny. ever?

1663
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:23,629
You can do anything you want.

1664
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:24,714
Oh. thanks.

1665
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:26,762
Where‘s the warmth
you‘re always talking about?

1666
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:28,296
You‘re as cold
as that frozen lake.

1667
01:22:28,371 --> 01:22:31,121
I adore Ginny. I have nothing
but the deepest affection

1668
01:22:31,187 --> 01:22:32,234
for both of you.

1669
01:22:32,307 --> 01:22:33,583
But you won‘t
forgive me?

1670
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,025
Is this man crazy
or what?

1671
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:36,913
No. he‘s not crazy.

1672
01:22:36,979 --> 01:22:39,051
You want us to
level with one another?

1673
01:22:39,122 --> 01:22:41,162
The truth is
we‘re all mad at you.

1674
01:22:41,234 --> 01:22:43,689
We love Ginny but we‘re upset
because Anne isn‘t here.

1675
01:22:43,762 --> 01:22:45,136
Maybe they‘re mad.
but I’m not.

1676
01:22:45,202 --> 01:22:46,413
Well. good.

1677
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:49,038
As long as
we‘re all honest and open.

1678
01:22:49,234 --> 01:22:51,754
Is this the fun part?
Are we having fun yet?

1679
01:22:54,962 --> 01:22:56,750
Ow!

1680
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,112
Damn it!

1681
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,240
What can I get you. folks?

1682
01:23:31,311 --> 01:23:32,937
Beer for me.

1683
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,015
And I’ll have a J&B
on the rocks. too.

1684
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:40,973
Great band.

1685
01:23:42,607 --> 01:23:44,265
You know. I always
wondered what happened

1686
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:45,927
to the old Glen Miller
arrangement.

1687
01:23:50,766 --> 01:23:52,774
So you don‘t think
I’m honest. huh?

1688
01:23:53,358 --> 01:23:55,780
Okay. Jack. forget it.
I’m sorry I said it.

1689
01:23:55,854 --> 01:23:57,098
No. say
what you think.

1690
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:58,726
Do you really
want me to?
Yeah.

1691
01:24:00,558 --> 01:24:01,964
Well.

1692
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:04,582
I think sometimes
you are a little cold.

1693
01:24:05,005 --> 01:24:06,860
There‘s a little part
of you always. uh.

1694
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:09,259
that hangs back
and judges.

1695
01:24:09,934 --> 01:24:12,006
You always want to get
to the bottom of things

1696
01:24:12,077 --> 01:24:14,182
but only so long as you
can make the rules.

1697
01:24:14,253 --> 01:24:16,162
Mmm-hmm. I see.

1698
01:24:17,581 --> 01:24:19,784
That‘s all right.
it‘s human.

1699
01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:21,991
Okay. fine. I’m human.
I don‘t mind being human.

1700
01:24:22,061 --> 01:24:23,883
As long as we realize
you‘re human. too.

1701
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:25,093
Yeah. I’m human.

1702
01:24:25,164 --> 01:24:26,593
As long as
we realize that

1703
01:24:26,669 --> 01:24:29,287
it‘s also human to be
the world‘s foremost authority

1704
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:31,112
on everything
from the roast beef

1705
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,903
to the nervous system
of the newt.

1706
01:24:34,188 --> 01:24:36,970
To be so completely obsessed
with your own body

1707
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:39,305
that you take
your temperature
at the dinner table!

1708
01:24:39,372 --> 01:24:41,259
Look. I think maybe
you better just cool it.

1709
01:24:41,323 --> 01:24:42,600
No. it‘s all right.
don‘t worry.

1710
01:24:42,668 --> 01:24:43,845
You‘re going
a little too far.

1711
01:24:43,915 --> 01:24:45,573
No. it‘s all right.

1712
01:24:46,635 --> 01:24:48,806
Let me tell you something.
Jack.

1713
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,817
I’m 10 years
older than you. right?

1714
01:24:50,891 --> 01:24:53,826
All right. I just hope
that when you get to be my age

1715
01:24:53,899 --> 01:24:56,681
you don‘t smell
the foul breath of death
and disintegration

1716
01:24:56,747 --> 01:24:59,976
hanging over your shoulder
the way I find it
hanging over mine.

1717
01:25:00,043 --> 01:25:02,017
I mean.
I go to sleep at night

1718
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:04,065
on an ache so bad

1719
01:25:04,138 --> 01:25:06,243
that it simply
will not go away.

1720
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:09,349
I wake up in the middle
of the night sweating

1721
01:25:09,802 --> 01:25:12,552
hearing my own bones decaying.

1722
01:25:13,354 --> 01:25:16,169
I have shifted into
a state of entropy

1723
01:25:16,234 --> 01:25:18,373
that‘s progressing
geometrically.

1724
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:20,934
You see. ‘‘entropy.‘‘

1725
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,588
‘‘progressing geometrically.‘‘

1726
01:25:23,658 --> 01:25:25,218
Y-you talk like
a bad textbook.

1727
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:26,783
Why don‘t you
just speak English?

1728
01:25:26,857 --> 01:25:29,890
Goddamn it! I just told you
my deepest fear!

1729
01:25:30,377 --> 01:25:32,766
Why can‘t you
listen to what I’m saying

1730
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:34,564
instead of how I’m saying it?

1731
01:25:35,017 --> 01:25:38,628
I mean. do you have
any idea. any idea.

1732
01:25:39,432 --> 01:25:41,537
what it is to be
afraid of death?

1733
01:25:42,792 --> 01:25:44,680
I can‘t eat my
bowl of cereal anymore

1734
01:25:44,744 --> 01:25:47,199
because I have
an irrational fear of milk.

1735
01:25:47,432 --> 01:25:49,407
I stand there in hallways<i>...</i>

1736
01:25:53,383 --> 01:25:54,758
I stand there in hallways

1737
01:25:54,824 --> 01:25:57,245
afraid to press
strange elevator buttons.

1738
01:25:58,439 --> 01:26:01,603
I almost threw away
my jockey shorts because
I have this fear of elastic.

1739
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,330
Don‘t laugh at him.

1740
01:26:07,623 --> 01:26:09,597
Go on. go on. what?

1741
01:26:10,246 --> 01:26:12,799
Laugh. good.
I’m a fool. right?

1742
01:26:13,255 --> 01:26:14,629
No. Danny.

1743
01:26:14,694 --> 01:26:16,549
I’m a collection
of eccentricities.

1744
01:26:19,142 --> 01:26:21,629
You think because I’m quirky.
I don‘t hurt?

1745
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,482
No.
Well. you have it wrong.

1746
01:26:25,574 --> 01:26:27,745
I’m quirky because I hurt.

1747
01:26:29,253 --> 01:26:30,814
Oh. Danny. I’m sorry.

1748
01:26:30,886 --> 01:26:32,292
All right.

1749
01:26:33,445 --> 01:26:35,005
Come on.

1750
01:26:35,269 --> 01:26:37,440
Are you really
afraid of your underwear?

1751
01:26:42,341 --> 01:26:44,031
I’m dying. she‘s laughing.

1752
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,988
We‘re not laughing. Danny.
Honest.

1753
01:26:46,053 --> 01:26:47,580
We are.

1754
01:26:47,653 --> 01:26:50,074
Forget it. Forget it.
Let‘s listen to the music.

1755
01:26:50,309 --> 01:26:53,375
No. it‘s all right.
Forget it.

1756
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,707
Okay. come on.
Danny. let‘s dance.

1757
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,728
Come on.

1758
01:26:56,836 --> 01:26:58,592
No. thanks. No.
I don‘t want to dance.

1759
01:26:58,692 --> 01:27:00,099
Danny!

1760
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:01,693
Dance.
Come on.

1761
01:27:01,764 --> 01:27:03,193
Go head. dance.
Go on. dance.

1762
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,921
Go boogie.

1763
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,881
I’m having one
hell of a time.

1764
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:13,950
All right!

1765
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:23,008
Strangers in the night

1766
01:27:39,938 --> 01:27:41,115
Fire.

1767
01:27:41,986 --> 01:27:43,513
I’m dying for some coffee.

1768
01:27:43,586 --> 01:27:44,534
Oh. get us
some coffee.

1769
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:46,464
Coffee! Hello!

1770
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:49,050
Anybody home? Coffee!

1771
01:27:50,305 --> 01:27:52,378
Come on. give us
a little smile. Come on.

1772
01:27:52,449 --> 01:27:53,594
Coffee!

1773
01:27:53,665 --> 01:27:54,876
That‘s nice.

1774
01:27:56,833 --> 01:27:59,135
You trying to
get us thrown out?

1775
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:00,822
There‘s nobody here.

1776
01:28:00,896 --> 01:28:02,783
I bet we‘re the only
people in this building.

1777
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,351
Throw me the newspaper.

1778
01:28:05,088 --> 01:28:06,298
Want some coffee?

1779
01:28:06,368 --> 01:28:08,190
Who wants coffee?
You want coffee?

1780
01:28:09,344 --> 01:28:10,718
Danny wants coffee.

1781
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,881
Danny needs
some coffee.

1782
01:28:27,423 --> 01:28:28,633
What? What?

1783
01:28:32,735 --> 01:28:34,109
Oh. God.

1784
01:28:38,175 --> 01:28:40,247
I think Danny‘s upset.

1785
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:41,812
Oh. he‘ll be all right.

1786
01:28:43,327 --> 01:28:46,556
We‘ve been joking
around all night
and he hasn‘t joined in.

1787
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:50,292
I think he‘s hurt.
I think maybe we owe
him an apology.

1788
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:52,340
What. because
I laughed at him?

1789
01:28:53,278 --> 01:28:55,220
Well. yeah.

1790
01:28:58,270 --> 01:28:59,796
Look. Ginny.

1791
01:29:00,797 --> 01:29:03,797
when people have been
friends as long as we have

1792
01:29:03,869 --> 01:29:05,691
it‘s not
such a terrible thing

1793
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,059
to kid somebody
out of a depression.

1794
01:29:08,957 --> 01:29:12,185
So don‘t get upset
about what you
don‘t understand.

1795
01:29:19,676 --> 01:29:21,880
I’ve just about
had it with you people.

1796
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:23,801
What‘s the matter?

1797
01:29:24,732 --> 01:29:26,870
I’ll tell you what‘s
the matter. I’m mad.

1798
01:29:26,939 --> 01:29:28,346
Ginny?

1799
01:29:28,859 --> 01:29:30,070
I fall in love
with this man.

1800
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:32,114
and all of a sudden.
in addition to him

1801
01:29:32,187 --> 01:29:34,489
I’ve got four
constant companions!

1802
01:29:34,779 --> 01:29:36,884
I have to work out
a new relationship

1803
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,646
with somebody who
is going through

1804
01:29:38,715 --> 01:29:41,235
the worst period of his life.
only I can‘t do it alone

1805
01:29:41,307 --> 01:29:43,576
I’ve got to do it in
front of four other people!

1806
01:29:43,643 --> 01:29:46,458
And it‘s not as if
my privacy was invaded.

1807
01:29:46,523 --> 01:29:48,530
you all have let me
know every single day

1808
01:29:48,603 --> 01:29:50,742
that I have been
intruding on your territory!

1809
01:29:53,946 --> 01:29:56,434
Let me tell you something.
As far as I’m concerned

1810
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:59,892
you‘re all demanding
and unforgiving.
every single one of you.

1811
01:30:00,282 --> 01:30:02,769
Everybody is sweet
and warm and simple

1812
01:30:02,842 --> 01:30:04,216
but everybody ignores me.

1813
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:05,874
I’m like a leper.

1814
01:30:06,809 --> 01:30:09,493
I’m--I’m a blank spot
where Anne used to be.

1815
01:30:16,761 --> 01:30:18,703
I’m going to go
take a run in the snow.

1816
01:30:23,353 --> 01:30:25,808
I hope she‘ll be
all right out there.

1817
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:29,998
Wish I hadn‘t
said that.

1818
01:30:30,137 --> 01:30:31,347
What happened?

1819
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,286
Ginny! Ginny!

1820
01:30:34,584 --> 01:30:35,566
I’m going after her!

1821
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,622
Nick!

1822
01:30:36,856 --> 01:30:37,936
You got a broken ankle.

1823
01:30:38,008 --> 01:30:39,568
She might fall
down in the dark.

1824
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:42,509
So what? She fell down
in the daylight.
she didn‘t hurt herself.

1825
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:44,242
In the dark
she might hurt herself.

1826
01:30:44,312 --> 01:30:45,904
Nick. she‘ll be okay.
Rest your foot.

1827
01:30:45,975 --> 01:30:48,626
I’m not going to run the risk
of her falling down out there.

1828
01:30:48,695 --> 01:30:50,702
Why not?
Because she‘s pregnant.

1829
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:54,262
Because she‘s pregnant?

1830
01:30:55,223 --> 01:30:56,368
Watch this.

1831
01:30:56,439 --> 01:30:58,130
Here‘s some real
heartwarming acceptance.

1832
01:30:58,199 --> 01:31:00,981
You‘re 43 years old.
you‘re going to
start having babies?

1833
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:02,959
I don‘t believe this.

1834
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:05,005
I have to check
everything with you?

1835
01:31:05,078 --> 01:31:08,210
As a matter of fact.
I told you I wanted
to start a new family.

1836
01:31:08,598 --> 01:31:09,808
With babies?

1837
01:31:10,294 --> 01:31:11,756
With what? Airedales?

1838
01:31:12,886 --> 01:31:14,478
Look. do what you want.

1839
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:17,133
Oh. thanks very much.
I really appreciate that.

1840
01:31:17,685 --> 01:31:19,246
Fellows. come on back inside.

1841
01:31:19,317 --> 01:31:20,462
It’s freezing out here.

1842
01:31:20,533 --> 01:31:22,322
Come on. you can‘t go
after her like that.

1843
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:23,567
Come on.
Come on.

1844
01:31:23,638 --> 01:31:26,321
Nick. please! Come on.

1845
01:31:35,861 --> 01:31:38,349
It’s starting to get bright.
Where the hell is she?

1846
01:31:41,173 --> 01:31:42,383
You know.

1847
01:31:43,892 --> 01:31:46,347
when she ran out of here
I started to think of

1848
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:48,783
all the friends
we‘ve had over the years

1849
01:31:48,852 --> 01:31:50,707
who‘ve jogged
out of our lives.

1850
01:31:51,732 --> 01:31:53,488
All the ones who‘ve. uh.

1851
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:57,617
who‘ve been inconvenient
to stay friendly with
and it scares me.

1852
01:32:00,531 --> 01:32:03,847
They move to another state
or they‘ve gotten a divorce

1853
01:32:05,427 --> 01:32:07,882
or else we‘ve just gotten
friendly enough with them

1854
01:32:07,954 --> 01:32:10,409
to realize they‘re a kind of
a pain in the ass

1855
01:32:10,482 --> 01:32:12,784
and pretty soon we
never see them again.

1856
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:16,465
I’ll tell you something.
Jack.

1857
01:32:17,874 --> 01:32:20,241
I don‘t want to
be one of two people

1858
01:32:20,306 --> 01:32:22,695
alone in the world
at the end of my life.

1859
01:32:24,977 --> 01:32:26,636
I want to have friends.

1860
01:32:30,066 --> 01:32:31,854
When I get old

1861
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:35,184
I’d like you all
to still be there.

1862
01:32:42,737 --> 01:32:44,166
Okay?

1863
01:32:45,009 --> 01:32:46,918
Why can‘t we
just let them be?

1864
01:32:48,592 --> 01:32:50,447
In other words.
I’m the problem?

1865
01:32:51,185 --> 01:32:52,461
I have to have
everything my way.

1866
01:32:52,528 --> 01:32:54,732
I’m unforgiving and cold
and judgmental. right?

1867
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,815
Right.

1868
01:32:55,888 --> 01:32:56,936
Right.

1869
01:32:57,009 --> 01:32:58,470
We‘re talking about me?

1870
01:32:58,704 --> 01:33:01,257
Jack. you know
those probing questions

1871
01:33:01,328 --> 01:33:02,572
you ask all the time?

1872
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,101
You‘re the only
one who answers them.

1873
01:33:04,176 --> 01:33:05,965
Everybody dances to your tune!

1874
01:33:06,352 --> 01:33:07,781
That makes me
sound like a tyrant.

1875
01:33:07,856 --> 01:33:09,230
Well. so what?

1876
01:33:09,328 --> 01:33:11,848
I am not a tyrant.
Goddamn it!

1877
01:33:13,776 --> 01:33:15,630
No matter what crap
I get from people.

1878
01:33:15,695 --> 01:33:17,321
all I ever give
back is a smile.

1879
01:33:18,031 --> 01:33:19,972
I never give
a response that‘s anything

1880
01:33:20,047 --> 01:33:22,862
but fair and rational
and cheerful!

1881
01:33:23,919 --> 01:33:25,326
Be careful!
Be careful!

1882
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:27,431
Why don‘t you
let your anger out
once in a while?

1883
01:33:27,502 --> 01:33:29,869
You want anger?
There! How‘s that?

1884
01:33:31,246 --> 01:33:32,588
Is that angry enough for you?

1885
01:33:32,654 --> 01:33:33,996
How about that?

1886
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:39,043
Is that angry enough for you?
Now is that angry enough?

1887
01:33:39,118 --> 01:33:40,808
Here. how about this?

1888
01:33:40,877 --> 01:33:42,339
What the hell you doing?

1889
01:33:42,414 --> 01:33:44,268
You know what
I expect from you.

1890
01:33:44,365 --> 01:33:46,253
I expect closeness

1891
01:33:46,318 --> 01:33:49,100
and warmth
and unconditional acceptance.

1892
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,140
And all I get from you
is secretiveness

1893
01:33:51,213 --> 01:33:52,839
and neurosis and a lot of<i>...</i>

1894
01:33:52,909 --> 01:33:54,665
Goddamn it!
Jesus Christ!

1895
01:33:54,733 --> 01:33:55,748
Put it down!

1896
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:58,504
I’m not paying for this!
This is your expense!

1897
01:33:58,573 --> 01:34:00,166
Yeah. bet your life!

1898
01:34:00,237 --> 01:34:02,692
All right. stop that!
Is that angry
enough for you. huh?

1899
01:34:02,764 --> 01:34:04,706
Stop that!
All right. stop it!

1900
01:34:04,812 --> 01:34:07,048
Stop it! That‘s enough!
That‘s all. stop it!

1901
01:34:07,148 --> 01:34:08,609
Come on! Settle down!

1902
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,423
Come here. Sit down.

1903
01:34:12,491 --> 01:34:15,306
Shh. Shh.
Shh. Shh.

1904
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:30,727
I wonder what other people do
on their vacations?

1905
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,493
Oh. God. I’m sorry.

1906
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:39,495
Jesus. look what I did.

1907
01:34:39,626 --> 01:34:41,415
So you freaked out a little.

1908
01:34:41,962 --> 01:34:43,239
So what?

1909
01:34:44,138 --> 01:34:45,632
I lost complete
control of myself.

1910
01:34:45,706 --> 01:34:48,259
Jack. nobody cares.

1911
01:34:49,482 --> 01:34:50,910
Hey.
What?

1912
01:34:52,746 --> 01:34:55,397
You‘re not the best
little boy in the world.

1913
01:34:55,753 --> 01:34:59,550
I hate to break this to you.
but you‘re not
the worst little boy. either.

1914
01:35:04,905 --> 01:35:07,687
You know.
sometimes when you say
things like that

1915
01:35:09,673 --> 01:35:11,298
I really hate you.

1916
01:35:11,368 --> 01:35:12,830
Thank you.

1917
01:35:14,152 --> 01:35:16,324
You know.
sometimes I hate you.

1918
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:25,924
Nick. what are you doing?

1919
01:35:25,992 --> 01:35:27,202
I got to go find her.

1920
01:35:27,271 --> 01:35:29,344
Wait a minute.
You stay.

1921
01:35:29,799 --> 01:35:30,814
I’ll go find her.

1922
01:35:30,888 --> 01:35:32,000
No. I can do it.

1923
01:35:32,071 --> 01:35:34,438
Nick. look. please.
I want to.

1924
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:36,765
Let me go. please.

1925
01:35:38,407 --> 01:35:39,585
Thanks. but I can do it.

1926
01:35:39,655 --> 01:35:40,800
No. I’ll do it.

1927
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,529
No. I’ll do it!

1928
01:35:42,599 --> 01:35:43,744
You sit down
and wait for me.

1929
01:35:43,815 --> 01:35:45,222
I’ll be right back!

1930
01:35:45,287 --> 01:35:47,075
Will you get out of my way?

1931
01:35:47,143 --> 01:35:49,477
Jack! Don‘t be ridiculous!

1932
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:50,688
He‘s got a broken ankle!

1933
01:35:50,759 --> 01:35:52,003
You‘ve got a torn ligament.

1934
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:54,307
You guys wouldn‘t get
10 feet in that snow.

1935
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:55,552
I’d get farther
than he can.

1936
01:35:55,622 --> 01:35:56,898
I’d get farther
than both of you.

1937
01:35:56,966 --> 01:35:59,355
What do you guys think
a pregnant woman is?
An invalid?

1938
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,706
I’ll be back
in two minutes.

1939
01:36:00,774 --> 01:36:02,203
Better start
fixing up this place.

1940
01:36:02,278 --> 01:36:04,864
That moose is going
to cost a fortune.

1941
01:36:10,277 --> 01:36:13,823
Ginny! Don‘t move.
I’ll be right there!

1942
01:36:14,021 --> 01:36:15,548
Stay right there!

1943
01:36:26,021 --> 01:36:27,265
Oh!

1944
01:36:31,268 --> 01:36:33,505
Hey. wait! Help me!

1945
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,678
Help me!

1946
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:37,788
Run to the lodge!
Go get help!

1947
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,321
I can‘t get out!

1948
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:44,124
Run! Go faster. faster!

1949
01:36:45,955 --> 01:36:47,744
Help! Help!

1950
01:36:55,523 --> 01:36:56,865
Are you all right?

1951
01:36:58,370 --> 01:37:00,988
Danny went through the ice
and he can‘t get out!

1952
01:37:14,242 --> 01:37:16,184
Jack!
Please help.

1953
01:37:41,056 --> 01:37:43,357
Help! Help!

1954
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,381
Quick!

1955
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,832
Jack. don‘t go too far out!

1956
01:38:01,695 --> 01:38:03,735
Okay. Danny!

1957
01:38:03,807 --> 01:38:04,952
Lift up your arms!

1958
01:38:05,023 --> 01:38:05,971
This side.

1959
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:07,257
Wait a minute.

1960
01:38:07,326 --> 01:38:08,220
Ready here!

1961
01:38:08,286 --> 01:38:10,425
Get your arm around that!
Get it under your elbow!

1962
01:38:10,495 --> 01:38:11,739
God damn it.
lift your arm up!

1963
01:38:11,807 --> 01:38:12,755
Danny. get it around!

1964
01:38:12,831 --> 01:38:14,107
Okay. hold onto the rope.

1965
01:38:14,175 --> 01:38:15,222
I got
the blanket.

1966
01:38:15,295 --> 01:38:16,342
Okay. go!

1967
01:38:16,478 --> 01:38:17,525
Back it up.

1968
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:19,513
Okay. go back.
Go ahead.

1969
01:38:19,582 --> 01:38:20,564
Go back slowly.

1970
01:38:20,638 --> 01:38:21,587
Easy! Easy! Easy!

1971
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:22,590
Pull the rope!

1972
01:38:22,654 --> 01:38:23,548
Easy.

1973
01:38:23,934 --> 01:38:25,112
That‘s it. Danny.

1974
01:38:25,246 --> 01:38:27,734
Go on. keep going!

1975
01:38:27,806 --> 01:38:29,660
Keep going!

1976
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,250
All right. hold it!

1977
01:38:35,389 --> 01:38:37,211
Danny!

1978
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:38,521
Danny!

1979
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:40,083
Danny?
How is he?

1980
01:38:40,157 --> 01:38:41,051
Danny!

1981
01:38:41,117 --> 01:38:42,045
Don‘t say that!

1982
01:38:42,109 --> 01:38:43,036
Danny?

1983
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:45,751
Danny?

1984
01:38:45,821 --> 01:38:47,098
Breathe. honey!

1985
01:38:47,165 --> 01:38:49,237
Little more!
Rub--rub his legs.

1986
01:38:49,309 --> 01:38:51,730
Come on.
Come on. sweetheart.

1987
01:38:58,236 --> 01:38:59,610
Thank God!

1988
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:03,256
Danny. are you all right?

1989
01:39:03,324 --> 01:39:05,080
Are you all right.
honey?

1990
01:39:05,404 --> 01:39:06,930
You almost drowned.

1991
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,176
Keep covered up.

1992
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:12,025
Thanks. I’m okay.
I’m okay. Thank you.

1993
01:39:12,092 --> 01:39:14,001
I almost died. and thank you.

1994
01:39:14,075 --> 01:39:15,668
Get him up!

1995
01:39:22,106 --> 01:39:25,368
Oh. my God! My Mercedes!

1996
01:39:35,066 --> 01:39:38,611
How could you drive
my Mercedes on thin ice?

1997
01:39:38,682 --> 01:39:39,729
Oh!

1998
01:39:41,146 --> 01:39:42,390
Danny. come on. get up.

1999
01:39:42,458 --> 01:39:43,668
Come on.

2000
01:39:46,809 --> 01:39:47,824
Oh. God!

2001
01:39:47,897 --> 01:39:49,174
Get off
the blanket.

2002
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:51,639
It was brand new!

2003
01:39:51,897 --> 01:39:54,515
In three years.
I could have gotten
twice what I paid for it!

2004
01:39:54,585 --> 01:39:57,236
Danny. Danny. we‘ll get
someone to fish it out
for you.

2005
01:39:57,305 --> 01:40:00,207
What the hell am I going to do
with a rusty Mercedes?

2006
01:40:00,281 --> 01:40:01,361
It’s gone!

2007
01:40:01,433 --> 01:40:02,480
It’s gone.

2008
01:40:02,553 --> 01:40:04,375
It sank like a stone.

2009
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,552
Danny!

2010
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:08,308
You are alive.
You have your life.

2011
01:40:08,472 --> 01:40:11,058
You have us and we love you.
so shut up!

2012
01:40:11,128 --> 01:40:12,142
Come on. Dan.

2013
01:40:12,216 --> 01:40:13,809
Go in. You‘re going to
freeze to death.

2014
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,822
Get into
the lodge and get warm.

2015
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:17,871
Sorry.
I just got a little crazy.

2016
01:40:17,943 --> 01:40:20,791
I’m sorry.
What do I care about the car.

2017
01:40:20,888 --> 01:40:22,262
It’s you I care about.

2018
01:40:22,327 --> 01:40:23,887
Let‘s go! Come on!

2019
01:40:23,959 --> 01:40:25,814
To hell with the car.
thank you.

2020
01:40:26,775 --> 01:40:29,589
Oh. my God.
you sank my car!

2021
01:40:29,655 --> 01:40:30,767
Get back.

2022
01:40:30,839 --> 01:40:32,148
Get back to the lodge
and shut up!

2023
01:40:32,215 --> 01:40:34,670
All right. I’m okay.
To hell with the car.

2024
01:40:34,743 --> 01:40:35,987
It’s you I love.

2025
01:40:36,055 --> 01:40:37,680
Come on. let‘s go.

2026
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:39,634
Come on. let‘s go.

2027
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:43,441
Why‘d you have to
take it on the ice?

2028
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:44,720
Will you shut up.
for Christ‘s sake!

2029
01:40:45,014 --> 01:40:46,672
We just saved
your goddamn life!

2030
01:40:47,094 --> 01:40:49,395
What were you trying to
rescue me for. anyway?

2031
01:40:49,462 --> 01:40:50,509
I was fine!

2032
01:40:50,582 --> 01:40:53,581
I’m sick of this
macho bullshit!

2033
01:40:54,038 --> 01:40:55,532
No more stunts. okay?

2034
01:40:55,606 --> 01:40:56,554
Okay. yeah.

2035
01:40:56,629 --> 01:40:59,149
You guys really
piss me off. you know that?

2036
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:00,431
Yeah. we heard you.

2037
01:41:00,501 --> 01:41:02,257
It’s gone.
I’ll never see it again.

2038
01:41:02,325 --> 01:41:03,438
Please. Danny.

2039
01:41:03,509 --> 01:41:05,331
I say we come back
next winter.

2040
01:41:05,397 --> 01:41:07,601
Will you listen to me.
