1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,351
He was the first.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,073
We got a street
in the park named after him.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,348
And Danny Topinka,

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,557
Billy Vorsovich,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,238
Phil and Larry Powell,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,878
Tommy Finnelli.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,276
Six boys from Massapequa...

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,719
and they all knew

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,911
what honour, duty,
and sacrifice meant.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,996
They paid
the highest price.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,917
They died for it.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,595
This town's
been hit hard.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,671
It's always
been hit hard.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,553
Doc here, he was
in the First War.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,592
A lot of us here
were in the Second.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,676
That's why
we can't give up.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,712
That's why we're going to
win in Vietnam.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,951
Because Massapequa's
been there before,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,992
because of those
six wonderful boys,

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,838
and because of him.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,069
Ron...

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,799
come say a few words,
would you, please?

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,393
Ron Kovic,
ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,278
He was born
on the 4th of July, 1946.

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,796
Give him a big hand
on his great birthday.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,952
I just want to say
for the guys in Vietnam

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,393
that we're doing our best.

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,113
It's not an easy situation,

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,399
but the boys' morale
over there is real high,

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,795
and you can feel
confident that we are...

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,195
we are going to
win that war.

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,711
I served my country,

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,070
and I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,997
Do not shed a tear.

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,999
I have my hands,
my eyes, my ears...

36
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,433
I have my heart...

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,639
and I have...

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,073
what I feel...

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,595
I have what I feel is...

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,750
an unquen... quenchable...

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,839
O.K. It's O.K., Ronnie.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,438
It's O.K., kid.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,353
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,515
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,278
And we'll
continue to fight

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,880
because of guys
like Ron Kovic...

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,033
Dad, where's the car?

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,479
It's across
the street.

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,919
Like he said,

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,279
we're going to
win that war.

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,554
Ronnie.

52
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,919
Ronnie.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,029
Timmy?

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,799
Timmy, man?

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,915
Timmy!

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,831
I heard you were...

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,239
When did you get back?

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,311
When did you get out?

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,795
Wow, man.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,517
Let's get the hell
out of here.

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,476
Mr Kovic?

62
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,351
Yeah. Sure.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,589
Antiwar demonstrators have come
to Washington, D.C.

64
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,471
To shut the city down.

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,596
...and Martin's
Laugh In,

66
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,598
starring Dan Rowan
and Dick Martin,

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,478
with Sammy Davis, Jr.

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,278
And Judy Carne...

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,389
Honey.

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,317
Come on.
It's starting.

71
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,554
O.K. I'm coming.

72
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,392
It's the one
with Sammy Davis.

73
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,515
Oh, yeah?

74
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,198
Who else
used to play?

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,633
Come on, Ronnie.

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,676
No. Come on.
Tell me who.

77
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,795
Bobby Moore
at shortstop.

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,074
Grady Rogers
at third.

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,634
Grady got sick.
It was Finnelli at third.

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,596
Tommy Finnelli.

81
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,715
Yeah.

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,436
Got hit with one
of his own mortars.

83
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,033
That's crazy, man.

84
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,429
Shit, I heard
about that.

85
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,034
Remember the twins,
Phil and Larry Powell?

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,274
Oh, the twins. Oh.

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,588
They were great wrestlers.

88
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,313
Oh, man.
They were fucking great.

89
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,236
Tough.

90
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,196
Tough bastards.

91
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,429
When Phil got killed,

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,353
Larry... who wasn't much
for brains either...

93
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,635
went down the next day
and joined up.

94
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,590
Oh, God.

95
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,834
Then he got hit.

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,830
Oh, no.

97
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,756
It's true.

98
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,671
A land mine
or something.

99
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,036
He got hit in the head
with a tree.

100
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,951
Yeah. I'm telling you
the truth.

101
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,712
He goes over to Vietnam,

102
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,758
and he gets killed
by a flying fucking tree.

103
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,671
Oh.

104
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,113
That's really fucking funny.

105
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,476
I think the whole town
got devastated, Ronnie.

106
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,348
I don't think
we got a friend left.

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,913
It's really funny.

108
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,548
When did you
get hit, Timmy?

109
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,193
September the 18th.

110
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,912
Near Dong Ha.

111
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,275
A lot of bad shit
up there, Ronnie,

112
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,514
I'm telling you.

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,750
Things I don't
even want to talk about.

114
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,353
You know.

115
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,590
I mean, uh...

116
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,193
it was crazy.

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,231
Shooting
anything that...

118
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,788
anything that fucking moved,
you know?

119
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,678
When did you...
When did you get hit?

120
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,636
Me?

121
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,073
Well...

122
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,754
Uh, January 20th.
Yes.

123
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,308
Someplace off...
I don't even remember.

124
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,719
Up in the DMZ.

125
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,995
Walked into
a whole battalion of them.

126
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,718
Got shot
in the foot.

127
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,995
I got up
like I was...

128
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,752
back in the woods again,

129
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,637
like I was
John fucking Wayne,

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,393
emptying a mag, screaming,
"Come on, Charlie, motherfucker!

131
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,311
Come on out,
Charlie, motherfucker!"

132
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,879
Rat-tat-tat-tat.

133
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,559
I heard this crack
above my right ear,

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,949
and I just
felt my body...

135
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,157
drop out from under me.

136
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,391
Well, I thought
I was dead for sure.

137
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,799
Was the, uh...

138
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,279
How was
the hospital?

139
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,190
It sucked.

140
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,156
I know.

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,116
Really bad.

142
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,191
I'll tell you
something, Ronnie...

143
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,430
Sometimes
at night...

144
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,193
I get these headaches,
you know?

145
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,554
They're bad.

146
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,510
And, uh...

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,279
they just kind of
come over me,

148
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,477
and these doctors
don't know shit, you know.

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,950
They just come,
like I'm going crazy or something.

150
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,552
I don't feel... I don't feel
like me any more, you know?

151
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,477
I feel like...
when they come,

152
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,397
I feel like
somebody else.

153
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,839
What do you do?

154
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,713
Nothing.
Not a goddamned thing, you know?

155
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,719
Well... mostly I do
a lot of drugs.

156
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,910
Do anything
you can, you know?

157
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,030
Y-You get through it
any way you can.

158
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,630
When I was
in the hospital,

159
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,672
I thought, " Yeah.
Yeah, this makes sense."

160
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,398
What makes sense?

161
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,000
'Cause I failed, Timmy.

162
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,031
What are you
talking about?

163
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,517
'Cause I...

164
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,393
'Cause I killed someone...
some people. L...

165
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,352
I made some terrible...

166
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,429
mistakes.

167
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,830
Ronnie, we all made mistakes.
I mean, you...

168
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,035
you had no choice.

169
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,479
Those damn pansy
demonstrators

170
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,431
will never
understand.

171
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,754
Don't talk about it.

172
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,717
It was insane
over there.

173
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,234
Sometimes I wish...
I wish I'd...

174
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,430
When I got shot
in the foot,

175
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,192
I could have laid down.

176
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,590
Who gives a fuck now
if I was a hero or not?

177
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,955
I was paralysed,
castrated that day. Why?

178
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,032
'Cause I was so s...
stupid.

179
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,954
I have my dick and my balls now
and I think...

180
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,315
I think, Timmy,
I'd give everything I believe in,

181
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,436
everything I got...
all my values

182
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,311
just to have
my body again,

183
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,277
just to be whole again.

184
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,673
But I'm not whole.

185
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,910
I never will be,
and that's...

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,639
the way it is,
isn't it?

187
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,315
Ronnie...

188
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,799
it's your birthday.

189
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,110
You're alive.

190
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,273
You made it.

191
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,918
Smile.

192
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,076
Syracuse, New York,
our next stop.

193
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,958
Oh, where have you been

194
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,634
My blue-eyed son

195
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,871
Oh, where have you been

196
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,349
My darling young one

197
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,312
I've walked
and I've crawled

198
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,392
On six crooked highways

199
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,317
I've been out in front

200
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,158
Of a dozen dead oceans

201
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,316
I've been 10,000 miles

202
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,119
In the mouth
of a graveyard

203
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,150
And it's a hard

204
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,077
It's a hard

205
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,997
It's a hard

206
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,951
It's a hard

207
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,112
It's a hard rain

208
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,515
That's gonna fall

209
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,839
Who did you meet

210
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,155
My blue-eyed son...

211
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,155
Those long letters
I wrote you

212
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,559
from over there?

213
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,993
Crazy stuff, huh?

214
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,433
That's all right.

215
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,748
I had to say everything

216
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,638
I couldn't say
when we were growing up.

217
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,199
They were
beautiful letters.

218
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,156
Yeah?

219
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,593
Yeah.

220
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,478
I wasn't too sure
about the spelling in them.

221
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,233
Who cares
if you can spell?

222
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,390
There was...

223
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,910
There was a lot of feeling
in the words.

224
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,110
I'm so sorry for what happened
to you, Ronnie.

225
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,478
My mom called me
at school and told me.

226
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,471
I was just
so shocked.

227
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,788
L... I wanted to...

228
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,910
reach out
and help you.

229
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,273
But...

230
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,038
it was just
so frustrating,

231
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,149
I just...

232
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,034
stood in the hallway
of my dorm room shaking.

233
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,156
I couldn't
say anything.

234
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,155
Donna...

235
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,714
uh, they need you
over at Locklin.

236
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,870
I can't right now,
Jeff. Later.

237
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,030
Well, don't forget
about the meeting.

238
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,149
Yeah, 9:00?

239
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,758
Yeah. Thanks.

240
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,836
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,239
You're real busy, huh?

242
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,840
We've got this Kent State
demonstration tomorrow.

243
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,438
I'm on the organizing
committee.

244
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,675
Kent State.
I heard about that.

245
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,119
It was... Jesus...
terrible.

246
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,110
It's terrible.

247
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,395
When I saw that girl

248
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,313
lying in that pool of blood
at Kent State,

249
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,669
I kept on thinking
of that poster

250
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,320
of the children
that were killed at My Lai.

251
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,710
And I kept on thinking
about you over there...

252
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,075
and all the boys
who've died,

253
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,836
who've sacrificed
their bodies and...

254
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,393
and their minds.

255
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,317
The war is
so wrong, Ronnie.

256
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,316
It's so wrong.

257
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,516
I just had to
do something.

258
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,631
We don't need arms

259
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,077
We need hands to hold

260
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,791
And we don't need bombs...

261
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,269
Strike now,
shut it down!

262
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,999
Strike now,
shut it down!

263
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,911
Strike now,
shut it down!

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,117
You know, Ronnie,
I'm not saying that you are,

265
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,272
but if you have any feelings
against the war,

266
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,635
you could really help.

267
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,551
I mean,
you've been there.

268
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,153
You know
what it's like.

269
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,390
You could tell people
what's happening,

270
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,948
and they'd really
listen to you.

271
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,313
Remember the prom?

272
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,356
Moon River

273
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,112
Wider than the sea

274
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,395
My huckleberry friend...

275
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,310
Remember that?

276
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,276
Yeah.

277
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,873
Moon River for me

278
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,673
Boy, was I crazy
that night.

279
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,395
I just had to dance with you
before I went in.

280
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,596
It was like I knew.

281
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,519
I made a promise to myself
that I would come back

282
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,238
and love you
forever.

283
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,958
Donna.
Hey, Donna.

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,910
Yeah?

285
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,030
The Reverend
can't make it tomorrow.

286
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,996
What?

287
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,274
He can't make it.

288
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,236
Oh.

289
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,629
What can we do?
Who can we get?

290
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,359
Just let me think.
I'll see you later.

291
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,316
Better hurry.

292
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,879
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

293
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,158
Ronnie, I got to...
I got to go inside.

294
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,196
Do you want to come?

295
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,153
No, I don't
think so.

296
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,275
O.K.

297
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,869
O.K.

298
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,034
Maybe I'll
hang around.

299
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,798
Maybe we'll
talk later.

300
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,954
All right.
I'll see you later.

301
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,958
1, 2, 3, 4!

302
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,592
We don't want
your fucking war!

303
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,438
1, 2, 3, 4! We don't want
your fucking war!

304
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,631
1, 2, 3, 4!
We don't want your fucking war!

305
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,352
All right! Wow!

306
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,797
It's great to be at free
Syracuse University!

307
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,191
We're really getting
an education now, aren't we?

308
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,118
Right on, man!
Right on!

309
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,519
Right freaking on!

310
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,750
Yesterday I was at
Brooklyn College...

311
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,400
NYU... they were
both closed down!

312
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,000
Over 200 high schools
are closed down.

313
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,270
Over 400 universities
are closed down.

314
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,397
It'll be twice that number
by the time...

315
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,231
This is an unlawful
assembly.

316
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,397
If you do not
disperse...

317
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,000
The people that killed
the kids at Kent State

318
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,395
have names like
General Waste-more-land!

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,072
Spiro Agnew!

320
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,550
Tricky Dicky Nixon!

321
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,634
Wait for the command.

322
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,631
And then we go
to Washington,

323
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,116
confront the war makers
in their own house!

324
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,434
On to Washington!

325
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,516
On to the White House!

326
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,437
I loved
this country once.

327
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,397
And all this
I won over there.

328
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,833
Check it out...

329
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,429
Purple Heart,
Bronze Star,

330
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,919
all the commendation
medals,

331
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,315
all the rest
of that garbage.

332
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,713
It don't mean a thing.

333
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,472
Fuck this...

334
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,278
shit!

335
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,759
This is war!

336
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,677
I said this is war!

337
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,917
They just killed two brothers
at Jackson State!

338
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,877
Stand by to gas!

339
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,917
Take them down!

340
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,669
What's going on?

341
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,869
Get out!
Get out of here!

342
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,313
Get out of here!

343
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,634
Get back! Get back!

344
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,309
Donna!

345
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,199
The whole world's
watching!

346
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,514
The whole world's
watching!

347
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,391
The whole world's
watching!

348
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,237
The whole world's
watching!

349
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,673
The whole world's
watching!

350
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,113
The whole world's
watching!

351
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,110
The whole world's
watching!

352
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,189
Donna!

353
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,514
Now, when I was just
a little boy

354
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,195
I stand up
to my daddy's knee

355
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,989
My papa said, son,
don't let the man get you

356
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,396
The way that
he done to me

357
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,954
'Cause he'll get you now...

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,910
He says...

359
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,035
No, he'll get you...

360
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,479
My machine breaks down,

361
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,353
and they're ready
to cut my leg off.

362
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,271
And that's what the guy...

363
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,153
Now, that's what the guy
in the hospital said.

364
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,077
He said, " You can
take your Vietnam,

365
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,469
and you can stuff it up your ass,"
he said.

366
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,239
That's what it's
about in Vietnam.

367
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,151
Hey, Mel!
Double shot of rye,

368
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,593
beer chaser,
sweetheart!

369
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,955
They ain't fighting
the war to win, anyway.

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,877
They should
just bomb Hanoi

371
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,758
and get the boys
the fuck out of there.

372
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,358
Four corner hard way.

373
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,594
Fuckin'-A.

374
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,914
Vietnam.

375
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,439
Vietnam.

376
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,357
They ought
to write a song

377
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,789
about something
that gets under your skin.

378
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,239
Remember Del Shannon?

379
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,395
Runaway?

380
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,471
As I walk along

381
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,199
I wonder what went wrong

382
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,555
To our love

383
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,154
A love that was so strong

384
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,593
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

385
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,511
I'll tell you
what went wrong

386
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,672
It was fucking Vietnam

387
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,631
It was the wrong fucking war.

388
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,439
Timmy, it was
the wrong fucking war.

389
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,471
Take a shot, will you?

390
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,391
You can take
your Vietnam,

391
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,314
and you can shove it
up yo' fuckin' ass!

392
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,715
You shove it
up your ass, pal.

393
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,677
Is everybody
supposed to feel sorry

394
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,115
because you're in
a fucking wheelchair?

395
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,111
You ain't the only
fucking Marine here.

396
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,513
I was on Iwo Jima.

397
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,835
We lost 5,000 men
the first day.

398
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,673
Don't cry in your
fucking beer to me.

399
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,119
Now, you served
and you lost.

400
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,559
You got to live
with it.

401
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,999
You're a Marine, man.

402
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,916
Semper fi.

403
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,315
Picked them.
They didn't pick you.

404
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,079
Quit your fucking
pissing and moaning.

405
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,470
Timmy, Timmy,
who is this asshole?

406
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,391
I don't know.
Leave it alone.

407
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,993
I think guys...

408
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,989
like you...

409
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,519
are dumb fucking assholes.

410
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,913
That's what I think.

411
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,355
I bet you do, you sorry
son of a bitch.

412
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,311
'Cause you know
if they win,

413
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,554
if they win it,

414
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,477
you'll be the first
against the wall.

415
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,193
You know you can't trust
a fucking traitor.

416
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,993
Call me a fucking traitor?

417
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,911
If you weren't
in that chair...

418
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,116
I am in this chair!

419
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,634
Top of the ninth,
Charlie!

420
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,193
Shut the fuck up.

421
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,798
You shut the fuck up, man!

422
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,592
Come on, Phil,
forget it!

423
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,710
- Bullshit!
- He's a nutjob!

424
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,189
Come on, Ronnie,
he ain't fucking worth it.

425
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,639
Will you come on?

426
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,194
Hey, what's happening?
What's your name?

427
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,434
Jenny.

428
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,873
Penny?

429
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,915
Jenny.

430
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,718
How about going
to Mexico with me?

431
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,833
Mexico?
What do you mean, Mexico?

432
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,155
I mean, you're really beautiful.
That's what I mean.

433
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,229
Oh, yeah?

434
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,356
Oh, a really
beautiful place...

435
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,078
the ocean...

436
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,479
the sand, sun.

437
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,913
We could leave tonight.

438
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,798
We could take a plane.
Let's go tonight.

439
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,871
I think you're
really crazy.

440
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,753
Hey, hey, Billy!

441
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,755
Hey, Steve!

442
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,710
What's going on?

443
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,318
Same old same old.

444
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,796
Well, I can remember
the 4th of July

445
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,671
Running through
the backwoods bay

446
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,909
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

447
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,036
I bet you practised a lot.

448
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,236
I've got a lifetime
of practice, Jenny.

449
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,551
The way that he done to me

450
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,631
'Cause he'll get you now

451
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,913
Gonna getcha

452
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,915
Uhh

453
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,797
Well, I can remember...

454
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,239
You O. K?
You all right?

455
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,679
I don't mean
to laugh.

456
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,119
Shut up, Jenny.

457
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,355
Look at him.
He's fucking shitfaced!

458
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,355
Ronnie?

459
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,231
Ron?

460
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,759
Ronnie?

461
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,519
Give him some room.

462
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,919
Get him out of here.

463
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,353
Give me my chair.

464
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,793
Give me my chair.

465
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,711
I just want to dance.

466
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,631
I just want to dance.

467
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,711
Give me my chair.

468
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,313
Jenny!

469
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,515
Jenny!

470
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,948
I got it.
I got it.

471
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,874
Come on, come on.

472
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,428
Hey, Steve,
let's go. Come on.

473
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,197
Come on.
Steve, come on.

474
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,309
Let's go.

475
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,593
What's going on?

476
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,999
Are you drunk again?

477
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,956
Hey, Mom.

478
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,439
He's drunk again.

479
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,317
Eli, we have
a drunk for a son.

480
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,799
You leave that alone.

481
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,677
You can't stay
in this house.

482
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,115
This is what
you believe in,

483
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,519
but I don't.

484
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,431
I don't believe
in him any more.

485
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,351
I'll take care
of him.

486
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,238
I wish I were dead
like him.

487
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,151
You don't know
what you're saying.

488
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,639
That's the problem.
I'm not dead.

489
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,073
I got to live.

490
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,832
I got to roll around

491
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,990
and remind them
of Vietnam.

492
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,917
You don't want to see us.

493
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,393
You want to hide us

494
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,635
'cause it is
a can of shit!

495
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,079
And I am a fucking dummy!

496
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,991
He won't listen.
He won't change.

497
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,433
Take your mom seriously.

498
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,357
You can't drink
in this house.

499
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,277
I believed everything
they told us.

500
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,476
Go fight! Go kill!

501
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,953
Sergeant man,
Marine Corps!

502
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,718
Yo, squad!
Left, squad!

503
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,079
Right, squad, left!

504
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,513
And it's all a lie.

505
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,195
The whole thing
is a bunch of lies!

506
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,032
Stop it! Go to bed!

507
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,271
What did they do to you
in that war?

508
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,157
You need help, Ronnie.

509
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,758
No, you need help,

510
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,193
with all your God

511
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,157
and your bullshit dreams
about me!

512
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,992
You are ashamed of me!

513
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,238
Go to sleep.
You go to bed.

514
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,833
Fuck you!

515
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,229
What did you say
to me?

516
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,833
What...

517
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,069
Mom!

518
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,269
Fuck you!

519
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,753
You'll wake
the whole neighbourhood.

520
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,319
Wake them up!
Tell them!

521
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,512
Cusacks! Camelettis!
Walshes!

522
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,393
You tell them all
what they did to me,

523
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,273
what they did to this whole block,
this whole country.

524
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,793
They'll call the police.

525
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,677
We went to Vietnam
to stop communism.

526
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,830
We shot women
and children.

527
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,269
You didn't shoot
women and children.

528
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,673
The church
blessed the war.

529
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,119
Communism,
the insidious evil.

530
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,628
They...
They told us to go.

531
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,233
Yes, that's what
they told us.

532
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,072
Thou shall not kill, Mom.

533
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,953
Thou shall not kill
women and children.

534
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,877
Thou shall not kill,
remember?

535
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,275
Isn't that
what you taught us?

536
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,236
Stop it.

537
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,912
Stop it!

538
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,876
Stop it!

539
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,269
I don't want you
in this house.

540
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,679
You're out
of this house.

541
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,591
Ron, you made your point.

542
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,035
No! I haven't
made my point.

543
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,439
You tell her, Dad.

544
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,158
They're killing
everyone now!

545
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,599
I didn't force you
to go!

546
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,079
Yes, you did!

547
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,957
And it's all
falling apart!

548
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,713
King, Kennedy,
Kent State!

549
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,677
We all lost
the fucking war!

550
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,079
It's not my fault!

551
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,991
Communism won.
It's all for nothing.

552
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,274
That's not true,
Ronnie.

553
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,635
How do you know?
What do you know?

554
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,556
Ron.

555
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,956
Will you...
You tell her, Dad!

556
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,152
Tell her it's a lie!
It's a fucking lie!

557
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,593
There's no God!

558
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,511
God is as dead
as my legs!

559
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,909
There's no God!
There's no country!

560
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,876
It's nothing.

561
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,679
It's just me
and this fucking wheelchair

562
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,234
for the rest of my life
for nothing.

563
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,872
Me and this... this...

564
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,319
this dead penis, Mom.

565
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,958
Oh, God! Ronnie!

566
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,439
No, not with
the catheter.

567
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,839
- For God's sake...
- Penis!

568
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,753
Eli, I can't
stand it any more.

569
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,193
To hell with you.

570
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,236
In church
they say it's a sin

571
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,594
if you play
with your penis.

572
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,198
I just wish I could.

573
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,913
Don't say penis
in this house!

574
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,836
Penis!

575
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,875
Stop!

576
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,995
Penis!

577
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,712
Big fucking erect penis, Mom!

578
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,830
- Stop!
- Penis! Penis!

579
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,229
He won't let go!
What can I do?

580
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,629
I never even got time
to learn how to use it.

581
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,513
It's gone in some
jungle in Asia.

582
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,830
Just gone for...

583
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,916
I'm sorry
it happened this way.

584
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,795
I'm sorry you're sad, Mom.

585
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,475
I'm so sorry
you're sa-sad.

586
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,831
I'm so fucked up.

587
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,512
Fucked up.

588
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,634
Ronnie...

589
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,153
maybe a little trip
is all you need.

590
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,599
That place
down in Mexico

591
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,039
you were
talking about.

592
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,911
I don't want
to go to Mexico.

593
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,798
I don't want
to go no place.

594
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,838
I don't want
to go no place.

595
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,675
Ronnie...

596
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,475
I think
you should go.

597
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,511
What can I do,
Ronnie?

598
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,113
What do you want?

599
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,792
I want to be
a man again.

600
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,395
Who's going
to love me, Dad?

601
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,954
Who's ever
going to love me?

602
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,073
Who's going to love me?

603
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,555
Hey, you maggots,
ante up 5 American.

604
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,953
Let's go. Ante up.

605
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,632
Ed, you're light.

606
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,636
The game
is seven-card stud,

607
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,073
one up, two down.

608
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,038
One up, two down.
We got a 5, a jack.

609
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,957
That's a fucking joker, a king.

610
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,396
The price of poker
just went up, gentlemen.

611
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,549
Charlie buys a queen.

612
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,591
Charlie, puppy.

613
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,079
Two down, two down.

614
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,549
Hey, big blue eyes,
what's your name?

615
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,550
What's that?

616
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,959
What's your name?

617
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,916
Ron Kovic.

618
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,592
Just what we need.
Another limp dick.

619
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,590
Where from?

620
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,437
Massapequa,
Long Island.

621
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,351
Guys, say hello
to Ron Kovic.

622
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,793
Just in from the States.

623
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,359
Hi, Ron.

624
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,271
Laugh, motherfucker.
You'll get yours.

625
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,874
Fuck you.

626
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,269
Put your hand
right there, baby.

627
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,271
What's your name?

628
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,231
Charlie,
from Chicago.

629
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,834
How long has this game
been going on?

630
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,148
55 hours.

631
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,117
How long
have you been here?

632
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,479
A hundred fucking years.

633
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,869
'Cause I got a gun.

634
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,554
I ain't ever going back.
Fuck the States.

635
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,198
Nobody understood.

636
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,191
Nobody gave a shit.

637
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,514
The fucking women

638
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,591
didn't even want
to look at me.

639
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,516
Fucking States.

640
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,279
I ain't never
going back.

641
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,038
I want something simple.

642
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,871
Oh, baby,
you're so beautiful.

643
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,239
Ain't she beautiful?

644
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,230
Here we go.

645
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,515
She's beautiful.

646
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,437
Go into town.
Get yourself one.

647
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,836
Fuck the shit out of you,
even if you are paralysed.

648
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,672
Ain't that right, Martha?

649
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,320
You know what they say:
If you ain't got it in the hips,

650
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,836
you better have it in the lips.

651
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,553
Don't stay here,
man.

652
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,158
Get the fuck out.

653
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,274
You know, you're really drunk
on this Mescal shit...

654
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,471
when you swallow
the worm

655
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,353
and don't even know
you did it.

656
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,159
Last round of betting.
Let's go, maggots.

657
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,471
Are you from
Villa Dulce?

658
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,391
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,435
Yeah.

660
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,714
Bueno.

661
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,472
We go?

662
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,595
What's that?

663
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,555
Do you want
to go upstairs?

664
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,632
No. No, I'm just
looking around.

665
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,716
I just came in... Yeah!

666
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,557
I'd like to go upstairs.

667
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,119
I'd like to.

668
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,317
Good.
Then come.

669
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,793
Let's do it.

670
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,673
What's your name?

671
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,630
Maria Elena.

672
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,556
Maria Elena?

673
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,158
Hmm, si.

674
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,393
The money...

675
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,750
Sorry, I don't know how much...

676
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,236
This... This is good.

677
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,110
Why don't you
take them off?

678
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,349
No, I can't.

679
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,799
I can't
feel anything.

680
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,559
I was paralysed
in the war.

681
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,119
Vietnam?

682
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,833
Yes.

683
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,757
You let me see?

684
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,869
No.

685
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,716
Doesn't move.

686
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,670
I can't.

687
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,596
Oh, yes.

688
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,595
It's no good.

689
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,993
Yes, let me see.

690
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,951
No. Look, please...

691
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,792
the spine was severed.

692
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,189
I have no movement,
no feeling.

693
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,157
There's nothing
down here at all.

694
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,110
Nothing happens.

695
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,149
O.K.

696
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,355
O.K.

697
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,628
O.K.

698
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,956
We're going to have
a good time.

699
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,551
It's going to be O.K.

700
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,839
- You like?
- Yes.

701
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,952
Hey, man, Kovic.
How was it?

702
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,228
How was it?

703
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,590
Ai yi yi yi

704
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,511
Did you get one?
Did you get two?

705
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,113
Look out!

706
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,559
Banzai, motherfucker!

707
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,836
She loves you,
right, tiger?

708
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,514
Thanks a lot.
It was great.

709
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,393
Just remember,
keep one hand on her tits

710
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,998
and the other hand
on your wallet.

711
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,871
Paradise!
Right, man?

712
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,349
Whoo!

713
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,678
Can I see this?

714
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,153
I'll rip your fucking eye out
and skull-fuck you, motherfucker.

715
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,834
You ever been skull-fucked?
You ever been skull-fucked?

716
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,350
Yeah, I'll do it, man.
I'll do it, motherfucker.

717
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,630
It don't mean a fucking thing.

718
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,993
I'll be here tomorrow.

719
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,350
You couldn't keep me away
with a baseball bat.

720
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,271
I'll be here for sure.

721
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,115
Vietnam.

722
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,752
So...

723
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,677
we get married
today, no?

724
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,558
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That would be great.

725
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,789
Yeah.

726
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,913
Hi.

727
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,837
Want to fuck me? Huh?

728
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,510
I'll give you
a blow job.

729
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,798
Hey, mister,
you want me?

730
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,592
60 pesos.

731
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,828
Let's go.

732
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,389
Aah!

733
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,395
"Dear Mr and Mrs Wilson...

734
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,508
"I don't... I don't know
how to tell you this.

735
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,552
"I knew your son
in Vietnam.

736
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,918
He was, uh..."

737
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,909
I'm going to kill that fucking guy.

738
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,798
I got him once.
I'll kill him now.

739
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,279
You'll see.

740
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,390
I'm serious.

741
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,116
Your body.

742
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,833
I'm just going
to fucking kill him.

743
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,552
ˇMás!

744
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,835
I'll fucking kill you!

745
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,279
I'll kill you,
bitch!

746
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,357
You can't talk to me
like that!

747
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,311
Hey! Charlie!

748
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,595
Get out! Get out!

749
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,309
The bitch thinks it's funny
I can't move my dick!

750
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,793
Fuck her.

751
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,269
I'll kill you, bitch!

752
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,999
Fuck all you
Mexican motherfuckers!

753
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,439
ˇMaricón!

754
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,118
You don't like it,
get out!

755
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,952
Fuck you!

756
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,514
Hey!
Don't touch my friend.

757
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,437
Don't you touch me!

758
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,879
Get the hell out!

759
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,030
Don't come back no more.

760
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,953
I wouldn't be here if
it weren't for that fucking war!

761
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,878
Fuck you!
Fuck all of you!

762
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,037
You sure you told him
the right place, man?

763
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,469
I told him fucking Villa Rosa!

764
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,436
Villa Rosa?

765
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,396
Villa Rosa!

766
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,833
Villa Rosa, seńor,
Villa Rosa.

767
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,796
Beautiful place.

768
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,400
Great whorehouse there,
man.

769
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,549
Wait until we get there.

770
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,279
Beautiful women with big tits,
small tits...

771
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,319
That goddamned slut.
That Mexican scumbag cunt.

772
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,793
I think I saw a sign,
Villa Rosa, Charlie,

773
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,598
10 minutes ago.

774
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,910
How far you going,
taco head?

775
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,234
żQué pasa?

776
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,794
Wasn't that turn back there...
that sign that said "Villa Rosa"?

777
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,711
Look at the meter!
It's rigged!

778
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,392
He's rigged the fucking meter!

779
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,435
Hey, asshole!

780
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,909
Hey, I told you
fucking Villa Rosa!

781
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,638
What are we
going to do now?

782
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,755
Fuck them.

783
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,236
Yeah, sure.
How we going to get out of here?

784
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,072
Fuck them all.

785
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,519
Fuck the whores.

786
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,959
Fuck the cab drivers.

787
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,558
Fuck Mexico.

788
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,513
Fuck Nixon, fuck Vietnam,
fuck them all.

789
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,511
But how we going
to get out of here?

790
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,591
They made me
kill babies, man.

791
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,874
Little gook babies.

792
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,837
You ever have
to kill a baby?

793
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,229
Yeah. O.K., come on.
We'll get a ride.

794
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,038
We got to get back
to the villa.

795
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,839
Fuck you!
What do you mean, O. K?

796
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,751
What do you mean, O. K?

797
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,355
You ever have to kill
a little gook baby?

798
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,079
What the fuck do you know
what I did?

799
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,991
I didn't think so.
I didn't think so.

800
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,593
You're full of shit.

801
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,999
No, you are.

802
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,957
Leave me
the fuck alone!

803
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,029
You're nuts.

804
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,792
The sun
is going down.

805
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,996
We got to get
out of here.

806
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,435
Don't shit me, Kovic.
You never killed a baby.

807
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,873
You never had to.

808
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,713
You never put your soul
into that war,

809
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,637
never put your soul
on the line.

810
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,511
How the fuck
do you know?

811
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,438
Maybe I killed more babies
than you did, you fuck!

812
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,708
Maybe I did,

813
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,797
but I don't have
to talk about it!

814
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,235
Why not?
Why the fuck not?

815
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,639
What are you hiding?

816
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,359
What are you,
better than anybody else?

817
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,793
You a hero, maybe?

818
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,677
Got a bunch of fucking medals,

819
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,955
but deep down
you're full of shit!

820
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,634
You never fought.
You weren't even there.

821
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,914
What the fuck do you mean,
I wasn't there, man?

822
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,831
Come on, hero,
come clean.

823
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,319
Why should I?

824
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,719
What are you hiding?

825
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,030
You're the one that's hiding
here in Mexico.

826
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,799
What are you hiding from,
you whiny fuck?

827
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,239
Don't shit me!

828
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,113
You never killed anybody, anything,
did you, Kovic?

829
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,110
Did you?

830
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,395
Ever look at yourself
in the fucking mirror?

831
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,310
- Fuck you.
- You.

832
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,391
No... you!

833
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,230
Fuck you!

834
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,038
No, fuck you!

835
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,558
Get off me!

836
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,958
Hola, seńores.
żQué pasa aquí?

837
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,193
We need a ride.

838
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,599
O. K!

839
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,993
ˇVámonos!

840
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,159
You O.K., man?

841
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,350
Fuck you.
You're full of shit.

842
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,278
You don't get it.
You don't get it.

843
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,993
You had a town once,
Charlie,

844
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,871
and a mother and father.

845
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,115
Things that made sense.

846
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,038
Do you remember
things that made sense,

847
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,911
things you could count on,

848
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,270
before we all
got so lost?

849
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,233
What are we going
to do, Charlie?

850
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,794
What am I going
to do, man?

851
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,430
What am I going to do?

852
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,713
Where you from, Wilson?

853
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,676
Venus, Georgia.

854
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,069
Georgia?
This is my second tour,

855
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,914
and I haven't seen
a Georgia boy get it yet.

856
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,035
Yeah?

857
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,677
Yeah,
I know about Wilson.

858
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,513
Sir, I think I might
have killed him, sir.

859
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,272
I think
I killed him.

860
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,873
I don't think so.

861
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,878
You don't have to worry
about them dogs.

862
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,353
They won't bite.

863
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,239
Y'all get away now.

864
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,639
Get on away!

865
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,029
It's all right.
It's all right.

866
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,918
They're probably just
afraid of that chair.

867
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,150
Mr Wilson, I'm Ron.

868
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,549
Thanks for, uh,
for seeing me.

869
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,916
Any friend of Billy's
is a friend of ours.

870
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,879
Well, uh, why don't you
come on in the house?

871
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,396
My wife fixed some chicken,
if'n you want some.

872
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,833
Yes, sir, it was
a real nice funeral.

873
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,515
Marine Honour Guard came
all the way down from Atlanta

874
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,959
in their fancy uniforms.

875
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,958
Fired their rifles
up in the sky.

876
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,910
Thank you.

877
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,234
The drums was beating.

878
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,629
'Course it was nothing
like the big war

879
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,274
100 years ago
down here.

880
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:21,277
But there was Billy
and Bruce... Bruce Crabtree...

881
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,839
Andy Henderson.

882
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,559
And the Rutledge boy,
Lance.

883
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,108
Yeah, Lance.
He was a nice boy.

884
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,559
For the life of me,

885
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,955
I still can't quite
figure that war out.

886
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,197
Why we had to go
all that dang way to fight it

887
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,034
and why's we had to lose
so many young men.

888
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,031
Can't figure it out.

889
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,034
But we got a proud tradition
here in this town.

890
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,675
Billy's great-grandfather
was at the First Bull Run.

891
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,792
My pa was
over in France in '18.

892
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,668
Don't forget, you were
over in the Pacific in '44.

893
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,715
Guadalcanal.

894
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,988
Is that right?

895
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,913
Yeah. Well, I guess
this family's fought

896
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,276
in every war that, uh,
this country's ever had.

897
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,158
I reckon we're ready
to do it again

898
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,832
if'n we have to.

899
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,756
'Course they never did know
what done happened and all.

900
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,515
There was a letter
from a colonel,

901
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,033
I think it was.

902
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,235
Colonel Moore.

903
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,629
That's right,
Colonel Moore.

904
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,553
He said there was
a bad ambush one night.

905
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,513
Said that Billy distinguished himself
in the fighting.

906
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,831
He also told us that
Billy died real quick.

907
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,798
That's good
that he died quick.

908
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,677
I was
his squad leader.

909
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,075
I didn't know Billy
real well.

910
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,475
He was new,
kind of quiet.

911
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,308
We didn't talk much
to new guys.

912
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,669
He was 19,
is that right?

913
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,278
That's right, 19.

914
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,309
Only son?

915
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,675
Yes, sir.
My only boy.

916
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,553
I think he said
he was married

917
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,039
and you were pregnant?

918
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,279
I remember
the day he was killed.

919
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,108
Uh... it was a strange day.

920
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,239
We were out on patrol
near a beach area...

921
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,317
and, oh,
it was very confusing.

922
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,920
There was screaming
and firing.

923
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,194
Uh...

924
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,513
It was getting late,

925
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:44,192
and there were
these children, uh...

926
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,352
these babies...

927
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,908
that we killed
by mistake.

928
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,874
How awful.

929
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,112
And then it...

930
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,038
got really crazy.

931
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,990
And we had to pull back

932
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,192
because the NVA
were coming up on us.

933
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,113
And we got scattered
in the dunes.

934
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,633
People were yelling
at anything,

935
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,029
firing at anything.

936
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,078
And that was when it...
it happened.

937
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,953
I was, uh, confused...

938
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,155
scared.

939
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,468
I raised my rifle
three times...

940
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,551
and... shots...

941
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,749
The body fell
in the dunes.

942
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,513
God, this is...

943
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,353
this is very difficult
for me to say.

944
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,670
We don't have
to hear this, Ron.

945
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,349
But I think I was the one
that killed your son.

946
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,472
I was the one.
I was the one.

947
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,153
I was the one.

948
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,314
What's done
is done, sir.

949
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,960
I can't ever
forgive you...

950
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,235
but maybe the Lord can.

951
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,628
We understand, Ron.

952
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,073
We understand the pain
you've been going through.

953
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,589
Peace now!

954
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,550
Peace now!

955
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,470
Peace now!

956
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,430
Peace now!

957
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,959
Peace now!

958
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,076
Bring our brothers
home now!

959
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,309
Bring our brothers
home now!

960
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,231
Bring our brothers
home now!

961
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,719
Bring our brothers
home now!

962
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,552
Bring our brothers
home now!

963
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,312
1, 2, 3, 4,

964
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,072
we don't want
your fucking war!

965
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,639
1, 2, 3, 4,

966
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,716
we don't want
your fucking war!

967
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,159
1, 2, 3, 4,

968
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,270
we don't want
your fucking war!

969
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,157
1, 2, 3, 4,

970
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,952
we don't want
your fucking war!

971
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,871
1, 2, 3, 4,

972
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,951
we don't want
your fucking war!

973
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,712
1, 2, 3, 4,

974
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,472
we don't want
your fucking war!

975
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,391
1, 2, 3, 4,

976
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,471
we don't want
your fucking war!

977
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,269
Bring our brothers
home now!

978
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,836
Drugs. Marijuana.
Traffic violations.

979
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,239
Separate the hippies.

980
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,915
Tonight, I again proudly
accept your nomination

981
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,468
for President
of the United States.

982
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,870
And let us place ourselves

983
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,871
to win an even
greater victory

984
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,518
this November in 1972.

985
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,553
Four more years!

986
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,914
Four more years!

987
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,473
Four more years!

988
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,879
Four more years!

989
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,234
Four more years!

990
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,952
Four more years!

991
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,758
Four more years!

992
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,233
Four more years!

993
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,355
Four more years!

994
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,391
Can I break through
your complacency?

995
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,839
Do you have compassion

996
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,314
for the people
suffering in this war?

997
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,358
I'm telling you
this war is a crime!

998
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,273
I'm not as bitter
about my wounds...

999
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,669
Who do you
think you are?

1000
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,079
Can I help you, sir?

1001
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,513
You can't come through.

1002
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,999
You can't
come through, sir.

1003
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,832
I have a pass.

1004
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,113
Who are these people?

1005
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,270
You can't stop us!

1006
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,759
You can't stop me!

1007
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,193
You can't stop me!

1008
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,554
Why are you
here tonight?

1009
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,636
What do you
have to say?

1010
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,079
My name's Ron Kovic.

1011
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,473
I'm a Vietnam veteran.

1012
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,393
I'm here to say
this war is wrong,

1013
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,796
that this society lied
to me and my brothers...

1014
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,279
Why don't you
shut up?

1015
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,920
It deceived the people
in this country.

1016
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,316
It tricked them
into going 13,000 miles

1017
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,552
to fight a war against
a poor peasant people

1018
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,200
who have a proud history
of resistance,

1019
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,909
who have been struggling
for their own independence

1020
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,275
for 1,000 years...
the Vietnamese people.

1021
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,074
I can't... I can't find
the words to express

1022
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,953
how the leadership
of this government sickens me.

1023
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,389
Now, people say...

1024
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,597
people say if you
don't love America,

1025
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,033
then get the hell out.

1026
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,479
Well, I love America,

1027
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,353
but when it comes
to the government,

1028
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,913
it stops right there.

1029
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,554
The government is
a bunch of corrupt thieves.

1030
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,551
They are rapists
and robbers.

1031
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,999
We are here to say

1032
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,871
we don't
have to take it any more.

1033
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,520
We are here
to tell the truth.

1034
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,716
They're killing
our brothers in Vietnam.

1035
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,591
We want them
to hear the truth.

1036
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,510
Traitor!

1037
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,875
What are you,
a communist?

1038
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,393
Is this what we get,

1039
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,351
spit in the face?

1040
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,113
Is this what we get?

1041
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,351
Is this what we get, sir?
Spit in the face?

1042
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,789
We're never going
to let the people

1043
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,512
forget that war!

1044
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,391
Four more years!

1045
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,789
You're not sweeping it
under the rug

1046
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,996
because you didn't
like the ratings.

1047
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,990
This wheelchair,

1048
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:33,910
our wheelchairs,

1049
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,399
this steel, our steel

1050
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,198
is your Memorial Day
on wheels.

1051
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,629
We're your Yankee
Doodle Dandy come home.

1052
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,238
We're your
Yankee Doodle Dandy.

1053
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,753
Let's reject any philosophy

1054
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,798
that would make us
a divided people of America.

1055
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,790
Stop the bombing!

1056
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,955
Stop the war!

1057
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,950
Stop the bombing!

1058
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,075
Stop the war!

1059
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,797
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

1060
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,233
Some sort of scuffle

1061
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,788
has broken out
on the convention floor,

1062
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,189
disabled veterans
protesting the Vietnam War.

1063
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,998
We'll try to
get down there.

1064
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,356
Why are they gassing us
in the parking lot?

1065
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,793
Why are they fighting us?

1066
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,279
Because it's a lie.

1067
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,679
The truth is

1068
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,751
they've killed a generation
of young men.

1069
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,159
They have sacrificed

1070
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,196
a whole generation
of young men.

1071
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,798
Stop the bombing!

1072
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,437
Stop the bombing!

1073
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,839
Communists!

1074
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,552
Communists!

1075
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,396
Stop the bombing!

1076
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,708
Stop the war!

1077
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,552
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

1078
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,756
Traitor!
Go home!

1079
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,915
I say to you tonight...

1080
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,233
in these times,

1081
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,118
when there is so much
of a tendency

1082
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,033
to run down those
who have served America

1083
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,798
in the past and today,

1084
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,150
let's give those
who have served in Vietnam

1085
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,077
the honour and the respect

1086
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,793
that they deserve
and that they've earned.

1087
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,592
1, 2, 3, 4,

1088
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,039
we don't want
your fucking war!

1089
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,672
1, 2, 3, 4,

1090
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,432
we don't want
your fucking war!

1091
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,593
Get the car!

1092
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,079
Get the car!

1093
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,479
Shut the fuck up!

1094
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,676
You're under arrest,
Kovic! Come on!

1095
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,630
What?

1096
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,755
Shut up!

1097
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,193
You're a pig?

1098
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,073
You should've died over there,
you traitor.

1099
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,553
I don't have balance.

1100
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,995
Give me
your hands!

1101
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,718
O.K., I'll go
with you!

1102
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,949
I'm not
under arrest.

1103
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,268
I don't have to...

1104
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,759
Hey, take it easy!

1105
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,997
Get your hands
behind you!

1106
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,832
I'm paralysed!

1107
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,673
Get those cameras
out of here!

1108
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,636
Hey!

1109
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,994
Hey!

1110
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,632
I'm paralysed!

1111
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,750
Get in the fucking car!

1112
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,829
Hey!

1113
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,955
Hey!

1114
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,430
My chair!

1115
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,549
My ch...

1116
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,829
Stop it!

1117
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,478
Tactical line!

1118
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,308
Advance and disperse
the crowd!

1119
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,799
The whole world's
watching!

1120
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,155
Let me go!

1121
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,189
You O. K?

1122
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,633
Doc, is he O. K?

1123
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,596
I'm O.K.

1124
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,033
How we doing here?

1125
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,439
How many fingers
you got?

1126
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,839
Your head is cut.

1127
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,279
Anyplace else
hurting?

1128
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,197
I'm O.K.
Where's my chair?

1129
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,639
Where's my chair?

1130
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,079
Bring his
chair over!

1131
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,593
You're cut
over your eye.

1132
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,750
The media's got
to see this.

1133
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,438
We heard you
shouted down Nixon.

1134
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,078
Eddie was arrested,

1135
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,553
they beat Peterson,

1136
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,953
O'Malley's
gassed real bad,

1137
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,877
and Piscatelli's
got a concussion!

1138
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,673
It's a fucking mess over there!

1139
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,149
Frankie, bring the
media to the gate.

1140
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,155
What?

1141
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,599
The pigs are coming!

1142
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,993
They're clearing the park!

1143
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,951
They've arrested
like 30 people...

1144
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,399
O.K., O.K., listen up!

1145
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,271
Listen up.
Hey, hey, hey!

1146
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,197
We're going
to take the hall back.

1147
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,150
You hear?

1148
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,633
We're going
to the gate,

1149
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,989
we're gonna take
the motherfucking hall back.

1150
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,837
Fall out! Let's move!

1151
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,591
1, 2, 3, 4,

1152
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,830
we don't want
your fucking war!

1153
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,273
1, 2, 3, 4,

1154
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,112
we don't want
your fucking war!

1155
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,031
1, 2, 3, 4,

1156
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,111
we don't want
your fucking war!

1157
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,511
Let us reject the notion

1158
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,431
of politics of the few,

1159
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,909
by the few,
and for the few.

1160
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,076
We dedicate ourselves
to the notion

1161
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,276
this is a government
of the people,

1162
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,635
by the people,
and for all the people,

1163
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,191
black, brown, red,
yellow, white, women,

1164
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,874
young, old,
workers, students.

1165
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,394
This is our land
in this country.

1166
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,318
Ransom, the feminist,
she's six minutes over.

1167
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,197
I've got
the Jackson people

1168
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,679
breathing down my neck.

1169
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,590
Who follows?

1170
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,033
It won't
be a problem.

1171
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:02,996
You're next.

1172
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,956
Mr Kovic?

1173
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,951
We're just about
ready for you.

1174
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,473
Can I get you
anything?

1175
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,748
Coke, iced tea?

1176
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,153
Let's do it.

1177
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,191
O.K., Ron.
It's your time.

1178
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,714
It's been a long way
to get here.

1179
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,677
Tell them what
it is, Ron!

1180
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,079
Come on, Ronnie!

1181
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,549
Go get them, man.
For Eddie, man.

1182
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,953
Ronnie for president!

1183
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:22,916
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1184
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,309
The whole world's
watching. I love you.

1185
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,799
All right, Frankie!

1186
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,193
I feel good.

1187
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,633
Ronnie for president.

1188
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,278
Whoo!

1189
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,912
Congratulations.

1190
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,157
I love what
you're doing.

1191
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,993
Clear a path for me, please.
Stand back.

1192
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,075
Thank you.

1193
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,959
I had a dream, Ronnie.

1194
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,600
You were speaking
to a large crowd,

1195
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,717
and you were saying
great things.

1196
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,039
Our next speaker

1197
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,714
is one
of our Vietnam veterans

1198
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,713
who has something
very special to say tonight.

1199
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,834
Please!

1200
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,113
Please be quiet!

1201
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,997
Coming up top.

1202
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,674
What will you
say tonight, Mr Kovic?

1203
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,557
I'm going
to tell the truth.

1204
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,511
Any plans
for the future?

1205
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,471
I guess we'll see.

1206
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,358
Mr Kovic, could you please
sign your book?

1207
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,919
A young man

1208
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,349
who comes from
Massapequa, Long Island...

1209
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,317
All righty, coming through!

1210
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,197
All right, sweetheart.
Straight on through.

1211
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,077
Straight on through.

1212
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,475
How does it feel
to address the entire country?

1213
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,391
Uh, overwhelming...

1214
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,390
an honour...

1215
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,233
It's been a long way
for us...

1216
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,719
the vets... uh...

1217
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,555
Just lately I've felt
like I'm home.

1218
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,516
You know?

1219
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,478
Like, uh,
maybe we're home.

1220
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,239
Welcome home,
Ronnie!

1221
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,673
Go get them,
Ron!
