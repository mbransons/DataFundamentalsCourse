<i>'L' is for the way you look at me</i>

<i>'O' is for the only one I see</i>

6
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:58,929
<i>Love is more than just a game for two</i>

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,469
<i>Two in love can make it</i>

00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,605
<i>Take my heart and please don't break it</i>

00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:11,107

21
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,514
How about a souvenir picture?

22
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,764
Can you turn towards each other?

23
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:14,730
<i>Love was made for me and you</i>

24
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,488
<i>Love was made for me and you</i>

25
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,821
My God, my phone
just does not work out here.

26
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,404
Oh, my God.
How are we ever going to live?

27
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,449
Thanks!

28
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,458
There's a counselor. Excuse me,
can you tell me where the Navajo bunk is?

29
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,626
It's right over there. You can't miss it.

30
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,665
Welcome to Camp Walden.
I'm Marva Kulp, your camp director.

31
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,085
Now, girls, let's find our duffels
as quickly as we can.

32
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,219
We have a big first day ahead of us.

33
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,224
I'm going to turn the bullhorn over now
to my daughter and right-hand man,

34
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,558
Marva Junior.
Marva, bunk assignments, if you please.

35
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,644
All right, ladies, here we go. Listen up.
We got Berg, Kate - Iroquois.

36
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,277
Berg, Lily - Chickasaw.

37
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,736
Wait a minute.
I thought this was a boys' camp.

38
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,532
Boys?

39
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,789
OK. Found my duffel.

40
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,791
Now the question is, how do I get it out?

41
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,586
OK, I can do it.

42
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,888
OK, no, I can't.

43
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,300
- You must be new.
- How can you tell?

44
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,683
You didn't know how to grab your duffel
before the apes tossed it into the heap.

45
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,349
- I would say you need some serious help.
- Thanks. It's the big yellow one.

46
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,144
Whoa.

47
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:26,070
- Now that's my kind of woman.
- Yo, tie-dye girl!

48
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:30,203
Could you give me a hand with my duffel?
It's the yellow one buried way in there.

49
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,445
Sure.

50
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,781
Oh, that? No problem.

51
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,293
Hey. You're from California?

52
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,204
Do you, like, live in Hollywood?

53
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,043
Do you, like, live next door
to a movie star?

54
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,921
What are you two, Lucy and Ethel?
I've never even been to Hollywood.

55
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,212
I live in Napa - that's
in Northern California -

56
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,675
and I live next door to a vineyard.

57
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,510
- A what yard?
- A vineyard.

58
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,009
It's where you grow grapes to make wine.

59
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,096
That's what we do, me and my dad.
We own a vineyard.

60
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,727
- Parker, Hallie!
- Right here.

61
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,687
- Arapaho.
- That's what I am.

62
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,983
Yes.

63
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,570
Come on, you guys.

64
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,571
So, either of you by any chance
know how to play poker?

65
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,531
No, never played it before.

66
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,034
No? Gee, what a shame.

67
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,875
So, how much cash
did you guys bring with you this summer?

68
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,790
Whoa. Who is in there?

69
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,091
Okay, Arapahos. Come on, let's go!

70
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,643
Well, here we are.

71
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,392
Camp Walden for girls.

72
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,853
We traveled all the way
from London for this?

73
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,741
It's rather picturesque, don't you think?

74
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,369
Not exactly the term
I think I would have used.

75
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,745
Right. Shall we review your mother's list?

76
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,124
- Mm-hm.
- Now, let's see.

77
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,784
- Vitamins?
- Check.

78
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,627
- Minerals?
- Check.

79
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,209
- List of daily fruits and vegetables.
- Check, check.

80
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,546
Check for fruits,
check for vegetables. Go on.

81
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,927
Sunblock, lip balm, insect repellent.
Stationery, stamps.

82
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,093
Photographs of your mother, grandfather
and, of course, your trusty butler, me.

83
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,761
Got it all, I think.

84
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,932
Oh, and here's a little something
from your grandfather.

85
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,191
Spanking new deck of cards.

86
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,359
Maybe you'll actually find somebody
on this continent

87
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,187
who can whip your tush at poker.

88
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,658
Well, I doubt it, but thanks.
And thanks for bringing me here, Martin.

89
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,042
Now, you remember,
if you change your mind

90
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,744
and want me to come here
and collect you at the end of camp,

91
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,290
- I'm only a phone call away.
- Thanks, but I'll be fine.

92
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,794
Really. See you in eight weeks,
Marty, old pal.

93
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,009
Missing you already, queen of my heart.

94
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,278
- Have fun, old bean.
- I will.

95
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,368
- Toodle-oo.
- Toodle-oo.

96
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:24,953
Airport, please.

97
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:41,261
<i>Such a feeling coming over me</i>

98
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:47,016
<i>There is wonder in the things I see</i>

99
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,940
<i>Not a cloud in the sky</i>

100
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,605
<i>Got the sun in my eyes...</i>

101
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,952
Mom, mom! Are you there? Pick up! Mom!

102
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,076
Whoa, whoa, whoa, girls. Slow down.

103
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,582
You've got to have some too, OK?

104
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,204
It smells good.

105
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,915
- I'll save you a seat, Annie.
- OK. Thanks.

106
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:18,347
Excuse me, girls. I've just got to have
a scoop of these gorgeous strawberries.

107
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,596
- Would you care for some, dear?
- Oh, no, thanks. I can't. I'm allergic.

108
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,561
Oh, that's too bad.
How about you, dear? Strawberries?

109
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,565
Oh, sorry.
I wish I could, but I can't. I'm allergic.

110
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:32,737
Yes, allergic. You just told me that.
How did you get over there?

111
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,400
Oh, well.

112
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,695
First day of camp.
You'll have to excuse the old girl.

113
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,158
At least I'm not putting
salt in the sugar shakers.

114
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,873
Well, I mean, you know...
sugar in the salt shakers.

115
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,539
Now, where did she go?

116
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,049
Touché.

117
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,176
Good job.

118
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,396
All right, excellent, kids.

119
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:12,606
The winner and still undefeated champ
from Napa, California, Miss Hallie Parker.

120
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,823
Do we have any challengers?

121
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,743
Oh, come on, ladies.
Let's not be damsels in distress here.

122
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,743
- I'll take a whack at it.
- OK.

123
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,579
We've got ourselves a challenger.

124
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,871
Thanks.

125
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,175
Here I go.

126
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,717
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

127
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,386
Go, Annie.

128
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,226
Fencers ready?

129
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,892
Ready.

130
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,310
All set.

131
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,695
En garde. Fence.

132
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,639
Touché!

133
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,345
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

134
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,522
Touché.

135
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,364
- Sorry. Let me help you.
- No, let me help you.

136
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,954
- What'd you do that for?
- Me? You pushed me in.

137
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,116
- I did not.
- OK.

138
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,377
That was quite a show.

139
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,289
All right. I think we've got ourselves
a new camp champ.

140
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,794
From London, England,
Miss Annie James.

141
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,961
All right, girls. Shake hands.

142
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,049
Come on, girls.

143
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,279
- They look alike.
- Look at them.

144
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,129
- Why's everyone staring?
- Don't you see it?

145
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,836
- See what?
- The resemblance between us.

146
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,752
Resemblance?
Between you and me?

147
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,050
Let me see. Turn sideways.

148
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,600
Now the other way.

149
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,599
Well, your eyes are much
closer together than mine.

150
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,860
Your ears... well, don't worry,
you'll grow into them.

151
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,942
Your teeth are a little crooked.

152
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:07,118
Oh, and that nose. Well, don't worry,
dear. Those things can be fixed.

153
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,827
- Want me to deck her for you?
- Hold on. I'm not quite finished yet.

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,162
You want to know
the real difference between us?

155
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,295
Let me see.
I know how to fence and you don't?

156
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,421
Or I have class and you don't?

157
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,708
- Take your pick.
- Why, I oughta...

158
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,049
Ladies, it's time to break up
this little lovefest.

159
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:31,388
Annie, Hallie. I mean, Hallie, Annie...
I mean, whoa.

160
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,026
Sorry, ladies. Two pair.
Read 'em and weep.

161
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,940
I'm out.

162
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,907
- So that's it? No more takers?
- I've nothing left.

163
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,572
I'll take a whack at it.

164
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,961
Take a seat, Parker.

165
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,302
Deal me in.

166
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,648
<i>Well, on the day I was born</i>

167
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,059
<i>The nurses all gathered 'round</i>

168
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,440
<i>And they gazed in wide wonder</i>

169
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,939
<i>At the joy they had found</i>

170
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,149
<i>The head nurse spoke up</i>

171
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,652
<i>Said leave this one alone</i>

172
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,158
<i>She could tell right away</i>

173
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,582
<i>That I was bad to the bone</i>

174
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,492
<i>Bad to the bone</i>

175
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,174
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll make you a little deal.

176
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:51,054
- Loser jumps into the lake after the game.
- Excellent.

177
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,965
Butt naked.

178
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,888
Even more excellent.

179
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,558
Start unzipping, Parker.

180
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,562
Straight in diamonds.

181
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,818
You're good, James.

182
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,610
But... you're just not good enough.

183
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,528
In your honor, a royal flush.

184
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,037
- Love the birthday suit.
- Looking good!

185
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,637
Grab her clothes.

186
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,019
Right. Fine.

187
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,815
If that's the way you want it,
then let the games begin.

188
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,365
I swear I heard
your evil clone sneezing

189
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,246
all the way
across the mess hall this morning.

190
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:02,956
I am so tired. I am going back into bed
and sleeping till lunch.

191
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,044
That does not seem
like a possibility, babe.

192
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,925
- Why not?
- That's why not.

193
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,639
No way.

194
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,477
Sh.

195
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,105
Oh, I hope they're sleeping.

196
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,242
The coast is clear. OK, come on.

197
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,415
Payback time. Don't wake her up.

198
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,920
Careful.

199
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,173
Got milk?

200
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,552
Ugh!

201
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,395
Ew. Ew. Eew...

202
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,023
Oh, my God.

203
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,322
She didn't get me.

204
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,169
Whoaaa!

205
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,961
That girl is without a doubt

206
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,506
the lowest, most awful creature
that ever walked the planet.

207
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,266
Thank you, thank you very much.

208
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,306
- Morning, girls.
- Morning, Marvas.

209
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,391
Marvas?

210
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,688
Surprise inspection. Attention.

211
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,525
Navajos.

212
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,780
No, no, Marva. Do not go in there.

213
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,289
One of the girls got sick last night
and it is a big, big mess.

214
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,955
Save yourself the aggravation,
it's really disgusting.

215
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,591
Oh, well, if someone's sick, dear,
then I must go in.

216
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,720
Move aside, dear.

217
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,634
No, really, I insist.
I can't let you go in there.

218
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,762
She's highly contagious. Honest.

219
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,478
Actually, we're all quite fine in here,

220
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,815
unless Hallie Parker
knows something we don't know.

221
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:20,070
Really, I insist. Open the door
and come see for yourself, ma'am.

222
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,574
Stand aside, Hallie.

223
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,338
No!

224
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,769
I told you it was a mess in here.

225
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,271
She should know, she did it.

226
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,772
You and you...

227
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,483
pack your bags!

228
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:29,393
OK, girls. The rest of you,
back to your activities.

229
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,775
You two... the isolation cabin.

230
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,712
Oh.

231
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,296
Oh, gosh, it's stuck.

232
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,473
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

233
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,693
Oh, man.

234
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,536
Oh, here's your...

235
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,751
Cuppy.

236
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,836
- Any of your pictures ruined?
- Only the beautiful Leo DiCaprio.

237
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:31,465
- Who?
- You've never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio?

238
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,554
How far away is London, anyway?

239
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:39,018
Well, from here it's 3,000 miles,
but sometimes it seems much further.

240
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,062
How far away is your home?

241
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,399
California's way at the other end
of the country.

242
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,985
Actually, here's a picture of my house.

243
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,945
- Wow, it's beautiful.
- Yeah. We built it when I was little.

244
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:57,742
We've got this incredible porch that
looks over the entire vineyard and then...

245
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,786
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's my dad.

246
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,922
He didn't know I was taking the picture
then or else he'd have turned around.

247
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,880
He's kind of like my best friend.
We do everything together.

248
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,851
- What's the matter?
- It's chilly in here, that's all.

249
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,943
- Want one?
- Oh, sure. I love Oreos.

250
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,605
At home I eat them with peanut butter.

251
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,069
You do? That is so weird. So do I.

252
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,613
You're kidding?
Most people find that totally disgusting.

253
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,828
- I know. I don't get it.
- Me either.

254
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,341
What's your dad like? I mean,
is he the kind of father you can talk to

255
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,877
or is he one of those
workaholic types who says,

256
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,840
"I'll talk to you later, honey," but,
you know, never really does? I hate that.

257
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,679
I don't have a father, actually.

258
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:02,189
I mean, I had one once, I suppose,
but my parents divorced years ago.

259
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,395
My mother never even mentions him.

260
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,686
It's like he evaporated
into thin air or something.

261
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,822
It's scary the way
nobody stays together anymore.

262
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,198
Tell me about it.

263
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,994
- How old are you?
- I'll be 12 on October 11.

264
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,532
- So will I.
- Your birthday's on October 11?

265
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,951
- Yeah.
- How weird is that?

266
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,619
Extremely.

267
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,755
Oh, hey, it's stopped raining.

268
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,796
Want to go get a Popsicle or something?

269
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,812
- What's the matter?
- Hallie, what's your mother like?

270
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:48,144
I never met her. She and my dad split up
when I was a baby. Maybe even before.

271
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,979
I'm not sure.
He doesn't like to talk about her.

272
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,864
But I know
she was really, really beautiful.

273
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,485
How do you know that?

274
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:00,368
Well, because my dad had this old picture
of her hidden in his sock drawer.

275
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,535
He caught me looking at it, like,
all the time so he gave it to me to keep.

276
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:05,828
Look, I'm really thirsty.

277
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,584
Sure you don't want to go to the mess hall
and get a lemonade or something?

278
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,050
Will you stop thinking
about your stomach at a time like this?

279
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,007
- At a time like what?
- Don't you realize what's happening?

280
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,966
I mean, think about it.

281
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,932
I only have a mother
and you only have a father.

282
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:27,099
You've never seen your mum
and I've never seen my dad.

283
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,518
You have one old picture of your mum

284
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,278
and I have one old picture of my dad.

285
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,940
But at least yours
is probably a whole picture,

286
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,325
mine's a pathetic
little thing all crinkled

287
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,032
all crinkled and ripped
right down the middle and...

288
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,830
What are you rummaging
in your trunk for?

289
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,957
This. It's the picture of my mom.

290
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,871
And it's ripped too.

291
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:54,426
- Right down the middle?
- Right down the middle.

292
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,147
This is so freaky.

293
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,366
OK.

294
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,950
On the count of three,
we'll show them to each other, OK?

295
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,787
OK.

296
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,824
One.

297
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,459
Two.

298
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,871
Three.

299
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,347
- That's my dad.
- That's my mum.

300
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,809
That's the lunch bell.

301
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,475
I'm not so hungry anymore.

302
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,319
So, if your mom is my mom

303
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,947
and my dad is your dad,

304
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,156
and we were both born on October 11,

305
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,948
then you and I are, like, sisters.

306
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:11,082
Sisters? Hallie, we're, like, twins.

307
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,138
I just don't know what to say.

308
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,972
- What's that you're holding?
- My locket. I got it when I was born.

309
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,638
It has an <i>H</i> on it.

310
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:35,109
I got mine when I was born too,
except mine has an <i>A</i> on it.

311
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,151
Now I've got goose bumps.

312
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,526
My God, so I'm not an only child,
I'm a twin.

313
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,038
I'm a twin. There's two of me,
I mean, two of us.

314
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,745
- This is, like...
- Mind-boggling.

315
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,251
- Totally.
- Completely.

316
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,959
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

317
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,305
Tell me, what's Mom like?

318
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,014
Well, she designs wedding gowns.

319
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,178
Really?

320
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,223
She's becoming quite famous, actually.

321
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,226
A princess in Greece
just bought one of her gowns.

322
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,856
Wow.

323
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,734
You know what's interesting?

324
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,655
Neither one of our parents
ever got married again.

325
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,279
Has Dad ever been close
to getting remarried?

326
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:31,036
Never. He always says
I'm the only girl in his life.

327
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,203
Yeah. Mum's never come close either.

328
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,258
I have a brilliant,
beyond brilliant, idea.

329
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,798
I'm serious, I am a total genius.

330
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,559
- You want to know what Dad is like, right?
- Right.

331
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:56,145
And I'm dying to know Mom, so what
I'm thinking is... Don't freak out, OK?

332
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,897
I think we should switch places.

333
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,939
When camp's over,
I'll go back to London as you

334
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,949
- and you go back to California as me.
- What?

335
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,826
Annie, we can pull it off.
We're twins, aren't we?

336
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,990
Hallie, we're totally and completely,
100 percent different.

337
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,787
So? What's the problem? I'll teach you
to be me and you teach me to be you.

338
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,705
Look, I can do you already.

339
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,045
Yes. You want
to know the difference between us?

340
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,302
I have class and you don't.

341
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,006
Come on, Annie. I gotta meet my ma.

342
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,177
The truth is, you know, if we switch,

343
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:36,102
sooner or later
they'll have to unswitch us.

344
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,859
And when they do they'll have
to meet again, face-to-face.

345
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,815
After all these years.

346
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,023
Thank you. I told you I'm brilliant.

347
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,444
OK. This is Grandfather.

348
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,038
He's so cute. What do we call him?

349
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,074
- Grandfather.
- Why didn't I think of that?

350
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,664
This is Martin. He's our butler.

351
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,421
- We have a butler?
- Mm-hm.

352
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,754
OK. Living room's first,
then over here is the dining room.

353
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,965
But we never eat in there
except for Thanksgiving and Christmas

354
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,675
and, of course, October 11.

355
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,597
<i>Talkin' 'bout magic</i>

356
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,063
<i>Do you believe in magic</i>

357
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,648
<i>Do you believe, believe</i>

358
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,073
<i>Do you believe in magic</i>

359
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,152
OK.

360
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,029
I'm ready.

361
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,933
- Don't shut <i>your</i> eyes.
- Oh. OK. Right.

362
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,063
Sorry. Just got a little nervous.

363
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,271
You're nervous?
An 11-year-old is cutting my hair.

364
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,109
- Hey, you sounded just like me.
- Well, I'm supposed to, aren't I?

365
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,319
Go on, just do it.

366
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,614
Don't panic. You look great.

367
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,629
Looking good.

368
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,804
This is so scary.

369
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,014
Honey, you never looked better.

370
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,309
Oh, my God.

371
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,684
What?

372
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,311
I have pierced ears.

373
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,198
No. No, no and no. Not happening.

374
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:56,580
- Sorry, wrong number. I won't. I refuse.
- Then cutting your hair was a total waste

375
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,123
'cause, I mean, there's no way
I can go to camp with pierced ears

376
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,418
and come home without them.
I mean, come on. Get real.

377
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:22,772
- Needle sterilized.
- You sure you know what you're doing?

378
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,644
Relax. I've gone with all my friends
to get their ears pierced. It's nothing.

379
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,656
Just close your eyes
and it'll be over before you know it.

380
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,196
- Earring ready?
- Yes.

381
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,985
Good. Hand me the apple.

382
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:44,335
Thank you. Just relax.
I'm telling you, this is not a big deal.

383
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,292
On the count of three, remove the ice.

384
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,628
One. Two.

385
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,676
Three.

386
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,609
Girls, time to say your last goodbyes.
The buses are loading.

387
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,820
I'll see you guys next summer. I promise.

388
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:21,072
- OK. So call me every single day.
- All right, and write me. Don't forget.

389
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,743
OK. This is it.

390
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,913
So remember, you're going
to find out how Mum and Dad met.

391
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,169
And you're going to find out
why they broke up.

392
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,050
Annie James, your car is here.

393
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,712
That's you.
Here's your ticket and passport.

394
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,843
Martin will pick you up at the airport
tomorrow morning.

395
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,633
- What time do you leave?
- Oh, not for a couple of hours.

396
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,769
- Give Mum a kiss for me.
- And give Dad one for me.

397
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,771
Annie James. Front and center.

398
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,227
Bye.

399
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,393
Last call, Annie James.

400
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,191
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

401
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,200
Good luck.

402
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,842
OK. This is it.

403
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,895
God, I hope she likes me.

404
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,810
Please like me.

405
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,350
Please.

406
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,927
- Annie!
- Martin!

407
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,350
- Missed you.
- Missed you.

408
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,395
- What have you done to your hair?
- Cut it. Do you like it?

409
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,443
Love it. It's the new you.

410
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,950
And you've had your ears pierced.

411
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,152
Give me five, girlfriend.

412
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:43,094
<i>There she goes</i>

413
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,388
<i>There she goes again</i>

414
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,104
<i>Racing through my brain</i>

415
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,892
<i>And I just can't contain</i>

416
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:58,943
<i>This feeling that remains</i>

417
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,084
<i>There she goes</i>

418
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,204
<i>There she goes again</i>

419
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,045
<i>She calls my name</i>

420
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,460
- Home again.
- Thank you.

421
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,969
This is it. 7 Pembroke Lane.

422
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:33,832
Hello?

423
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,898
Grandfather?

424
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,405
- I'm home.
- Is that my little girl?

425
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,491
That tall gangly thing?

426
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,207
- Yes. It's me.
- Oh.

427
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,288
Welcome home.

428
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,002
- Did you have a good time, sweet pea?
- Uh-huh. Great.

429
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,386
What are you doing?

430
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,888
- Just smelling.
- Smelling?

431
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,050
- I'm making a memory.
- Oh.

432
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,688
Years from now, when I'm all grown-up,
I'll always remember my grandfather

433
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,651
and how he always smelt of...
peppermint and pipe tobacco.

434
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,066
- Good to have you back.
- Annie?

435
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,027
Annie?

436
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,077
- Mother.
- You're back!

437
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,344
- I can't believe it's you.
- And I can't believe it's you.

438
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,934
And with short hair. Who cut it for you?

439
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,021
A girl I met at camp. Do you hate it?

440
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,857
No, I absolutely love it.

441
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,022
You got your ears pierced?

442
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,828
Well, are there any other surprises?
Bellybutton rings? Tattoos?

443
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,663
Oh, darling, what is it?

444
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:42,294
I'm sorry. It's just
I've missed you so much.

445
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,752
I know. It seems like it's been forever.

446
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,714
You have no idea.

447
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,351
So, come on, tell me.
Did you like everyone? Was it fun?

448
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,640
Ah, Martin.

449
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,901
I found a stowaway in your suitcase.

450
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,562
- Oh, my God, Cuppy.
- Cuppy?

451
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,654
He belongs to my friend.
The one I was telling you about.

452
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,285
I can't imagine
how he got into my suitcase.

453
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,994
Well, since he's not our Cuppy,
shall we dispose of the little creature?

454
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,453
No!

455
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,036
I mean, no. I'll mail him to her.

456
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,630
She loves this thing a lot. A lot, a lot.

457
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,667
She's, like, slept with this thing
her entire life

458
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,087
and she could never be, like,
say, in a foreign country without him.

459
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,178
No, no. I'll take care of it.
That will be all, Martin. Thank you.

460
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,262
Hello?

461
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,644
Oh, hi. How's the photo shoot going?

462
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,905
Well, can't you manage without me?
I mean, Annie just got home from camp.

463
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,089
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

464
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,050
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

465
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,089
<i>And I say it's all right</i>

466
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,593
<i>Little darling...</i>

467
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,388
OK. Hold on a moment.

468
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,730
Annie, would you hate very much
running down to the studio with me?

469
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,690
No, I'd love it.

470
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,784
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

471
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,408
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

472
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,578
<i>I say it's all right</i>

473
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,875
<i>Little darling</i>

474
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:58,306
<i>The smile's returning to their faces</i>

475
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,432
<i>Little darling</i>

476
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:05,308
<i>It seems like years since it's been here</i>

477
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,939
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

478
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,767
Wow.

479
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,234
That's incredible. You designed that?

480
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,862
I had to do something
while you were at camp.

481
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,745
- You don't think it's too...?
- No, it's gorgeous. I love it.

482
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,114
You know who would look
really beautiful in that gown?

483
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,915
I mean, like, really beautiful.

484
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,667
- Who?
- You.

485
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,793
Me? You know what, I think that
time change has made you a little loopy.

486
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,333
Come on.
Let's see what all the fuss is about.

487
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,095
- OK. I'm here.
- Ah, we're saved.

488
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,630
- Hi, Vendela.
- Hi.

489
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,594
Sorry, we don't know
what to do with the veil.

490
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,805
If she wears it
it covers the back of the dress

491
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,436
- and if she doesn't, the dress looks...
- Incomplete. You're right.

492
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,060
Can you try turning sideways
with your chin up?

493
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,317
Yeah. I see the problem.
Can I have the veil? Annie, darling?

494
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,821
Pass me one of those hats
on display in the window.

495
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,731
- Me?
- Yes.

496
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,455
- Which one do you like?
- The white one.

497
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,366
Me too.

498
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:12,539
Try this.
Now throw the veil straight back.

499
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:16,000
That's it. Now spin around,
I want to see the back of the dress.

500
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:19,170
That's beautiful. Did you get that?
Just how it falls just down there.

501
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,634
Don't worry about the bouquet.
You're married now,

502
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,516
you've got to learn to juggle.
Don't forget to look happy.

503
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,892
It is your wedding day.

504
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,519
My mom is too cool.

505
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,479
<i>I'll never let you go</i>

506
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,438
<i>I'll never let you go</i>

507
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,243
<i>Never let you go</i>

508
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,086
<i>I'll never let you go</i>

509
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,836
So, doesn't designing
all these wedding gowns

510
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,921
ever make you think
about getting married again,

511
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,462
or at least make you think
about the F-word?

512
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,302
- The F-word?
- My father.

513
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,677
Oh, that F-word. Well, no, actually,

514
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:12,064
because I didn't even wear a wedding
gown when I married the F-word.

515
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,225
You didn't? Why not?

516
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,065
Why the sudden curiosity
about your dad, huh?

517
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,400
Well, maybe because
he's never mentioned,

518
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,406
and you can't blame a kid for wondering.

519
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,283
Mother, you can't avoid
the subject forever.

520
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,409
At least tell me what he was like.

521
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,744
OK. He was quite lovely,
to tell you the truth.

522
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,409
When we met
he was actually entirely lovely.

523
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,078
- All right?
- All right.

524
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,247
So did you meet him here in London?

525
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,757
- We met on the <i>QE2.</i>
- QE what?

526
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,966
The <i>Queen Elizabeth 2</i>. It's an ocean liner
that sails from London to New York.

527
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,973
'Cause I wasn't keen on flying then
and neither was your father.

528
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:50,102
We met our first night on board ship. We
were seated next to each other at dinner.

529
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,263
- He's an American, you know.
- No kidding?

530
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,807
So, was it love at first sight?

531
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,607
I knew you were going to ask me
all these questions one day. Taxi!

532
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:06,114
<i>Dear old Dad. I wonder
what he's doing at this very moment.</i>

533
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,371
Thanks.

534
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,461
Oh, gosh. It's him.

535
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,463
Hey, Hal!

536
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,720
Welcome home, kiddo.

537
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,896
- Get into these arms, you little punk.
- Dad.

538
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,810
Finally.

539
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:49,654
Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp because you are not going back.

540
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,446
I missed you too much.

541
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,746
What happened to you, Hal?

542
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,165
Something's changed.

543
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,413
Are you getting taller?

544
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,842
So, what's up, Dad?

545
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,173
I mean, how's Chessy and everybody?

546
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,306
Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you.

547
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:13,553
Eight weeks really is too long, Hal.
A lot's been happening around here.

548
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,971
A lot's happened to me too, Dad.

549
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,391
I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman.

550
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,354
What's the matter? I cut myself shaving?

551
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:27,775
No, it's just... just seeing you
for the first time.

552
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,990
I mean, you know... in so long.

553
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,955
You look taller to me too, Dad.

554
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,037
Come on, squirt. Let's get home.

555
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,767
<i>Oh, by the way,
thanks for all those newsy letters.</i>

556
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,644
I'm really glad I bought you
all that personalized stationery

557
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,305
you just had to have.

558
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,395
- We meant to write, Dad, but we just...
- "We?"

559
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:05,859
Oh, me and my friend. I met this girl
at camp and we got really close.

560
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,068
Great.

561
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,815
Practically like sisters.

562
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,243
- She was a lovely girl.
- "Lovely girl?"

563
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:15,205
What, all of a sudden you're so proper?

564
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,501
- Still biting those nails, I see.
- Dad, you noticed!

565
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,254
What do you mean, "noticed?" You've
been biting them since you could chew.

566
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,417
But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit.

567
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,547
"Lovely girl," "horrid habit."

568
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,759
What did I do, send you
to summer camp or finishing school?

569
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,766
And why do you keep saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

570
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,928
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad.

571
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,639
Sorry, Dad.

572
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:46,065
Do you want to know
why I keep saying "Dad?" The truth?

573
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,946
'Cause you missed
your old man so much, right?

574
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,116
Exactly.

575
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:56,451
It's because in my whole life - I mean,
you know, for the past eight weeks -

576
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:00,743
I was never able to say the word "Dad."
Never. Not once.

577
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,082
And if you ask me,

578
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,214
a dad is an irreplaceable person
in a girl's life.

579
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:10,548
Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers.

580
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,384
Just imagine someone's life
without a father.

581
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,549
Never buying a Father's Day card.

582
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,718
Never sitting on their father's lap.

583
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,477
Never being able to say, "Hi, Dad!"

584
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,606
or, "What's up, Dad?"
or, "Catch you later, Dad."

585
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:25,643
I mean, a baby's first words
are always "Dada," aren't they?

586
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,064
Let me see if I get this.
You missed being able to call me "Dad?"

587
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,325
Yeah. I really have, Dad.

588
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,163
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

589
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,875
Now you're starting
to sound like your old self.

590
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,690
Hello, gorgeous!

591
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,029
Oh, look at you!

592
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,364
Oh, you grew.

593
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,373
Oh, we missed you so much.

594
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:25,077
Hey. Don't you dare let your old man
talk you out of going back to camp, OK?

595
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,707
You're a growing girl. You need adventure.

596
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,165
- OK.
- You hungry?

597
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,883
I made corn bread and chili.

598
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,510
- Why are you so quiet? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

599
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,637
It's just I'm so happy to be home.

600
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,720
Hey, did I hear something
about corn bread and chili?

601
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,393
Yeah, it's on the stove. So...

602
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:47,103
Something's changed about you, Hal.
Hm. I can't put my finger on it,

603
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,984
but something about you
has definitely changed.

604
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:53,989
Really? Well, it's just the same old me.

605
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,112
Honest.

606
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,737
Hi, Sammy!

607
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,209
What is wrong with you, you goofball?
It's Hallie.

608
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,496
Oh, I probably just
smell like camp, that's all.

609
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,798
What's the matter with you?
It's like you didn't even recognize her.

610
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,055
Wow, it's even better than the pictures.

611
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,811
OK, kiddo.
What do you want to do first, huh?

612
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:34,025
You want to eat and then unpack,
or we could unpack and then eat.

613
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,986
Or we could eat while we unpack.

614
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,242
You mean I can eat in my room?

615
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,320
Yeah, it's a definite possibility.

616
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:46,037
Hey, Hal. When you're done, come on
down. There's someone I want you to meet.

617
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,956
- OK, Dad.
- OK, Hal.

618
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:55,417
Look at you, always eating.

619
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,800
- Did you tell her?
- No.

620
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,260
Oh, Nicky.

621
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,091
Tell me what?

622
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:08,430
Hal, it is none of my business how your
father makes a fool out of himself, OK?

623
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:13,193
- He's a big boy. He can do what he wants.
- OK, OK. So, who is she?

624
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,817
Her name's Meredith Blake.
She's a publicist from San Francisco.

625
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,986
Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer

626
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,028
to do some publicity for the vineyard.

627
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:28,246
If you ask me, she's doing a better job
of selling herself than the grapes.

628
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,628
What do you mean?

629
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,507
Look, you and I both know your father's
not some kind of suave, debonair,

630
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,009
bachelor-of-the-month type.

631
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,637
So I gotta ask myself,
what does a hot young thing like that

632
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,515
see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hanging out

633
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,176
and a cereal bowl full of chili.

634
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:51,147
Then I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's giggling.

635
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,978
All of them are sitting
at the Napa Valley Community Bank.

636
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,654
You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

637
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,907
Ah, what do I know?
But I tell you one thing,

638
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,568
this one's got your father
eating out of the palm of her hand.

639
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,497
They do everything together.
They ride together, they swim together.

640
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,658
They go out to eat dinner every night.

641
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:14,000
Do you know what? Meet her. See
for yourself. Don't let me influence you.

642
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:20,002
There's my girl. Honey,
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

643
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,300
Hal, this is Meredith Blake.

644
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:28,889
Hi.

645
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,481
Hi... Meredith Blake.

646
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,102
Wow, I can't believe
I'm finally meeting the famous Hallie.

647
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,823
- I have looked forward to this all summer.
- Really? Well, here I am.

648
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,530
Oh, Nicky, she's adorable.

649
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,116
You know, the way
your father talked about you,

650
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,248
I expected to meet a little girl,
but you are so grown-up.

651
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,118
I'll be 12 soon. How old are you?

652
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,037
Twenty-six.

653
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,549
Only 15 years older than me.
How old are you again, Dad?

654
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,756
Wow, suddenly you're so interested
in math. Look, I'm gonna go inside.

655
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,799
I'm going to get some more chili,
maybe a bottle of champagne to celebrate.

656
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,841
What are we celebrating?

657
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,103
Your homecoming, of course.

658
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,604
Be right back.

659
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,683
Meredith Blake.

660
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,562
Hello, Reverend Mosby.

661
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,526
Mm-hm.

662
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,446
Of course. No, I understand
it's for a local charity?

663
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,783
Oh, yes, I am writing it all down.

664
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,122
OK, it sounds very worthwhile, I agree,

665
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:37,212
but unfortunately I see that Mr. Parker
will be out of the country on those days.

666
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,670
Yes, absolutely.
I will be sure to mention it to him.

667
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,050
Thank you.

668
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,089
So...

669
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,596
How was camp, Hal? Was it fabulous?

670
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:50,676
- My dad's going out of the country?
- Oh. No.

671
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,687
I just had to tell a little white lie
to get him out of something.

672
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,682
You know, I have never heard
a man talk about his daughter

673
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,852
the way that Nicky talks about you.

674
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,612
You two are obviously incredibly close.

675
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,320
Well, you know, we're closer than close.
We're all each other has.

676
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,495
Sorry. Did I get you wet, Mer?

677
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,418
Just a little, Hal.

678
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:23,209
Hey, guess what.

679
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,878
Your daddy took me riding the other day
and he let me ride your horse.

680
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,134
I hope that's OK with you.

681
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:33,810
Oh, sure. Sprout's used
to strange women riding her.

682
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,263
Not that you're strange or anything.

683
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:40,063
Actually, compared to the others
you're relatively normal.

684
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,686
Others? What others?

685
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,197
- You want the 411?
- What's the 411?

686
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,777
The information, the lowdown
on other women. Can't say I blame you.

687
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,447
I'd want to know if I was number 28-
I mean, 29- in a man's life.

688
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,208
- I'm number 29?
- Yeah.

689
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:01,254
It's always the same routine.
Horseback riding through the vineyards,

690
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:06,168
romantic dinners with his special reserve
label wine. Moonlight swims.

691
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,512
Here we go.
A bottle of my special reserve label.

692
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:14,552
So, did you girls find something
to talk about while I was gone?

693
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,771
- Does that mean yes?
- It sure does.

694
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,651
Will somebody
grab that, please?

695
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,698
- James residence. Annie?
- Yes, Martin?

696
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,700
Oh, dear, it sounds just like you
on the phone.

697
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,329
I'm sorry. To whom
did you wish to speak? Annie?

698
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,241
Of course. One moment, please.

699
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,708
A Mildred Plotka for you.
Sounds just like your twin.

700
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,507
My twin? Very funny. Good one, Martin.

701
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:50,717
Hello? Oh, Mildred, darling.
Hi, how are you?

702
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,551
Hey. How's it going over there?

703
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:56,388
<i>Oh, everything's quite lovely here.
We're expecting a bit of rain today,</i>

704
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,849
but, Mildred, can you hold on
for a moment?

705
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,890
OK, but hurry, Hal.
I've got to talk to you.

706
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,196
OK. Now I can talk.
Oh, my God, Mom's incredible.

707
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,234
I cannot believe I lived my entire life
without knowing her.

708
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,073
She's beautiful and fun and smart

709
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,575
<i>- and I love the gowns she designs.</i>
- But...

710
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,331
And I got her talking
about how she and Dad first met

711
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,914
- and if you ask me there's a whole...
<i>- Hallie!</i>

712
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,124
Stop! We've got a major problem.

713
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,669
You're going to have
to bring Mother out here immediately.

714
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,592
Immediately? Are you nuts?
I've only had one day with her.

715
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,094
I'm just getting to know her.
I can't. I won't.

716
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,386
But this is an emergency. Dad's in love.

717
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:39,852
Get out of here. Dad doesn't fall in love.
I mean, at least not seriously.

718
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,347
Trust me, he's serious about this one.

719
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:47,022
He's always holding her hand and kissing
her neck and waiting on her hand and foot.

720
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,445
- He is?
- It's disgusting.

721
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,569
You'll just have to break them up.
Sabotage it. Do whatever you have to.

722
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,572
I'm trying, but, I mean,
I'm at a slight disadvantage.

723
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,120
<i>I only met the man 12 hours ago.</i>

724
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,957
<i>Hal, you've got to get back here
to help me.</i>

725
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,914
Annie, I can't. I want more time with Mom.

726
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,370
What's going on?

727
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,752
Annie, are you still there?
I can barely hear you.

728
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,542
- I'm here, what are you...?
<i>- Operator, operator.</i>

729
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,844
- I think I lost you, Annie.
<i>- Hello?</i>

730
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,010
Thanks for all the help, Hal.

731
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,930
Ahem.

732
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,772
Hi. I had a phone call
from a friend at camp.

733
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:29,357
Yeah, it's an old camp tradition,
talk to your friend from inside a closet.

734
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,316
Kind of stupid, I know, but...

735
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:36,360
So, breakfast, anyone?

736
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,577
OK. Here we go.
Most important meal of the day.

737
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,333
Eggs, sunnyside up. Bacon, side of toast.

738
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:48,247
And in case you're really hungry, a stack
of humongous chocolate chip pancakes,

739
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,836
which smell incredible,
if I do say so myself.

740
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,170
Thanks, Chessy.

741
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,295
You're not hungry again?

742
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,381
You hardly touched your chili,
your favorite food in the world,

743
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,845
and now you don't want your breakfast?
Are you sick, honey?

744
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,727
I'm fine, I promise. Where's Dad?

745
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,390
Oh, he and Miss
I'll-just-have-half-a-grapefruit-thank-you

746
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,356
left about an hour ago. You overslept
and he didn't want to wake you.

747
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,605
Of course I'd probably oversleep too

748
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:17,446
if I were up until midnight making
mysterious phone calls from my bathroom.

749
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,821
Oh. Oh, that? I was calling
a friend from camp. Mildred.

750
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:25,959
- She lives in New York.
- Oh, I see.

751
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,295
So you wanted to wait and call Mildred
at a time that was convenient for her

752
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,753
- because of the time difference?
- Exactly. Because of the time difference.

753
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:37,216
Uh-huh? So you waited until it was
three in the morning her time?

754
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,005
That makes perfect sense.

755
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:44,682
Actually... it was seven at night
her time. You see, she lives in New York,

756
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,563
but she was on vacation
with her family in Bora Bora.

757
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,485
- Mm-hm.
- Very smooth.

758
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,279
OK, look, smarty-pants, your father
wants you to meet him at his office

759
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,281
- as soon as you're done with breakfast.
- He does? Thanks.

760
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,238
I'm done.

761
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,247
Whoa!

762
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,916
That dog has gotten so weird.

763
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,048
Bye, Chessy. Thanks again
for breakfast. It was great.

764
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,839
Push, Hal.

765
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,093
Sorry. I... forgot.

766
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,565
Honey, I'm really glad you're here.
'Cause there's something

767
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,685
really important
I want to talk to you about.

768
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:36,195
That's funny because there's
something really important

769
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,855
I want to talk to <i>you</i> about.

770
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,241
- Yeah? Well, you go first.
- No, you.

771
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:44,988
OK. I want to talk to you about Meredith.

772
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:49,827
And I want to talk to you about my mother.
What about Meredith?

773
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,580
- Well, what about your mother?
- Dad, I'm almost 12.

774
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,623
How long do you expect me
to buy that story

775
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,758
that the stork dropped me
on your doorstep?

776
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:00,921
Oh, come on, Hal.
We've talked about your mother.

777
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,930
No, we haven't. Not really.

778
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,810
A girl needs more in life
than half a crumpled old photograph.

779
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,938
Dad, I'm almost a teenager.
Face it, I need a mother.

780
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,647
You know what. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

781
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,733
You do need a mother,
which brings me to...

782
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,070
- Meredith?
- Hi.

783
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,827
- Hello, Hal.
- Hi.

784
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:28,289
Hallie, this is my assistant Richard.
Richard, this is Nick's daughter.

785
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,495
The one I've been telling you
so much about.

786
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,036
- Oh, hello. How are you?
- Hi, there.

787
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,542
- Did you tell her?
- Almost.

788
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:39,254
Hey, if you're free later, why don't
we all have lunch on the terrace?

789
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,465
Well, actually, I promised Hal
we'd hang out together this afternoon.

790
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,098
Oh, no problem. I've got plenty to do.

791
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:51,514
I'm working on a new label design, Nicky,
featuring y-o-u. You're going to love it.

792
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,979
- See you for dinner, darling. Bye, Hal.
- Bye.

793
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,941
First change I make
is to send that two-faced little brat

794
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,106
off to boarding school in Timbuktu.

795
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:04,697
- Ooh. Ice woman.
- Proud of it, babe.

796
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,169
Come on, Dad.

797
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:23,131
OK, OK. You win. Hold up.
Give that horse a rest.

798
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,887
Whoa, Sprout.

799
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,926
So, honey, you excited
about our camping trip?

800
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,518
What camping trip?

801
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,807
What camping trip? The one we take every
summer before you go back to school.

802
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:38,192
Oh, that camping trip.

803
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,569
Yeah, sure. I can't wait.

804
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,197
So, Hal...

805
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,407
- What do you think of Meredith?
- As what, Dad?

806
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:52,373
Your publicist? Your friend?

807
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:55,873
No, just what do you think of her,
as a person?

808
01:01:56,421 --> 01:02:00,756
Well, she's cute.
She has nice hair, good teeth.

809
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,963
She can spell the word "you."

810
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,129
Honestly, Dad?
The woman's a complete stranger to me.

811
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,218
Why do you want my opinion anyway?

812
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,429
I'll tell you why, Hal.
Because, believe it or not...

813
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,310
Race you back to the ranch, Dad!

814
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,271
Hal!

815
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,183
Hal, I'm trying to tell you something.

816
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,689
Hey! Slow down.

817
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,515
I'm in so over my head here.
I can't handle this, I just can't.

818
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,346
I'm only one kid.

819
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:55,057
You got something you want
to share with the class there, Hal?

820
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,934
Chessy, you gave me a fright.

821
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,604
I gave you a fright?

822
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,237
You scared me.
I didn't know you were, like, in here.

823
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:09,408
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want to talk to me about?

824
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:15,407
Like why Sammy
never comes near you anymore.

825
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,997
Or why your appetite's changed.

826
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:22,797
Or why all of a sudden
you're neat as a pin

827
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:26,505
and using expressions like,
"You gave me a fright."

828
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:31,680
Chessy, I changed a lot
over the summer, that's all.

829
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,340
OK.

830
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:38,137
Boy, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say it's almost like you were...

831
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,687
Forget it. It's impossible.

832
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,319
Almost as if I were who, Chessy?

833
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,071
Nobody. Nobody. Forget I mentioned it.

834
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,733
Almost as if I were... Annie?

835
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,755
- You know about Annie?
- I am Annie.

836
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,084
Hal.

837
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,130
Hal, why did you take off on me like that?

838
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:15,141
I told you I wanted
to talk to you about something.

839
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,263
Chessy, why are you
looking at her like that?

840
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,641
Like what?
I'm not looking at her any special way.

841
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,561
I'm looking at her
like I've looked at her for 11 years.

842
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,735
Since the day
she came home from the hospital.

843
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:34,698
Six pounds, 11 ounces. 21 inches long.
This is how I look at her.

844
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,613
Can I hug her?

845
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,876
Oh, she's so beautiful.

846
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,792
And so big.

847
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:50,961
I'm going to make you something special
to eat. What would you like? Anything?

848
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,503
You know what, it doesn't matter.

849
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,297
I'm just gonna go whip up
everything we've got. OK?

850
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,266
Hal, come here.

851
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,604
- We have to talk.
- OK. Shoot.

852
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:03,810
OK.

853
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:06,309
Honey...

854
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:13,028
I want to know what you think
about making Meredith part of the family.

855
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:16,820
- Part of <i>our</i> family?
- Yeah.

856
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,285
- I think it's an awesome idea.
- Yeah?

857
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,914
- Inspired! Brilliant!
- You do? Really? You do?

858
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:27,751
Totally. I mean, like it's a dream come
true. I've always wanted a big sister.

859
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,123
Oh.

860
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,924
Um... Honey, I think
you're kind of missing the point.

861
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,473
No, I'm not.
You're going to adopt Meredith.

862
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:42,137
- That is so sweet, Dad.
- No, I am not going to adopt her.

863
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:46,015
I'm... going to marry her.

864
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,976
Marry her? That's insane.

865
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,029
How can you marry a woman
young enough to be my big sister?

866
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:55,111
<i>Mais tu plaisantes, j'espère.
Meredith, ce n'est pas une fille pour toi.</i>

867
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,447
<i>Mais c'est pas possible, je rêve.
Qu'est-ce qui...</i>

868
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,781
Calm down. Hal!

869
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,781
Are you speaking French?

870
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,621
I learned it at camp.

871
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,003
OK. I'm sorry.

872
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:12,508
Let's discuss this calmly.
Calmly and rationally.

873
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,589
Yeah, and in English, if you don't mind.

874
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,303
- Right?
- OK.

875
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,382
Sweetheart, what has gotten into you?

876
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,097
Nothing. Nothing. Just...

877
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:27,099
Dad, you can't get married.
It'll totally ruin completely everything.

878
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,142
Hal. Hal.

879
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:31,731
Hallie.

880
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,610
Don't look at me. I don't know a thing.

881
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,000
She thought I was going to adopt her?

882
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,962
- Hi, doll.
- Hi.

883
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,973
Oh. You look stressed, baby.

884
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,021
- How about a martini?
- How about a double?

885
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,106
Coming right up.

886
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,275
Chessy!

887
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:18,275
Don't you love it? It's just what we need,
it's such a big house. Chessy!

888
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,452
- You rang?
- Two martinis, please.

889
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,457
And make Mr. Parker's a double.

890
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,293
Chess, please. I'm getting a migraine.

891
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,092
- I told Hallie.
- You did? And?

892
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:42,803
She went ballistic.
She started yelling in French.

893
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,929
I didn't even know she spoke French.

894
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,100
- I don't know what's gotten into her.
- Oh, Nicky.

895
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,560
This reaction is totally classic.

896
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,521
It's "Daddy's Getting Remarried 101."

897
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,736
I'd be worried if she didn't act this way.

898
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,314
Look.

899
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,905
Why don't I go talk to her?
You know, woman-to-woman.

900
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:06,038
I think she's a little sensitive
about you right now.

901
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,459
That's why I need to do it.
We've got to break the ice sometime.

902
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:16,249
Wear your shirt like this. I like it
when I can see a little chest hair.

903
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,062
Knock, knock. Can I join you?

904
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,475
Sure.

905
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,284
Guess the news of the engagement
came as a bit of a shock, huh?

906
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,490
Basically.

907
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,872
You know, I remember
what it was like to be 11.

908
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,501
I had my first beau at 11.
It's a wonderful age.

909
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,584
You're just starting to feel like a woman
and, believe it or not,

910
01:08:56,758 --> 01:09:00,047
soon you'll understand
what it's like to be in love.

911
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,176
Me? I don't think so.

912
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:04,464
I don't even have
my 12-year-old molars yet.

913
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:09,473
Well, take it from someone
who got their molars very early in life,

914
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:14,098
being in love is a fantastic mystery
that takes a man and a woman...

915
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:18,394
I don't mean to be jerky when you're
trying to be all mushy and everything,

916
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,654
but I know what mystery
my dad sees in you.

917
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,401
You do?

918
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,614
You're young and beautiful and sexy
and, hey, the guy's only human.

919
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:27,904
But if you ask me,

920
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:31,245
marriage is supposed to be based
on something more than just sex, right?

921
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,418
Boy, your father underestimates you.

922
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,839
But you won't. Will you, Meredith?

923
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,797
Being young and beautiful's
not a crime, you know.

924
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,589
And for your 411, I adore your father.

925
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:50,100
He's exactly the kind of man
I always planned on marrying.

926
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,938
This is the real deal, honey. And nothing
you do is going to come between us.

927
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:56,890
Hate to break it to you, angel,

928
01:09:57,068 --> 01:10:00,061
but you are no longer the only girl
in Nick Parker's life.

929
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,276
- Get over it.
- If this is the real deal,

930
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:08,285
then my dad's money has nothing to do
with you wanting to marry him, right?

931
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,993
OK, puss. You listen and you listen good.

932
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,580
I am marrying your father in two weeks
whether you like it or not.

933
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,336
So I suggest
you do not tangle with me anymore.

934
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:22,216
You are in way over your head.
Is that clear?

935
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,218
Crystal.

936
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,270
Martin! A refill, please.

937
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,228
Lovely choice of wine, by the way, Martin.

938
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,113
- Thank you, sir.
- May I have a sip?

939
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,199
I don't think you're going to like it.

940
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:03,541
Well, if you ask me, the bouquet's
a little too robust for a Merlot,

941
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:07,462
but then again I'm partial
to the softer California grape.

942
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,350
Has she learned about wine
at the summer camp?

943
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,101
She must have.

944
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,570
- Darling! Are you all right?
- I had one sip too many, I guess.

945
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:29,279
You know, Mother, I feel
like I could use a bit of fresh air.

946
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,865
Would it be OK
if I stepped outside for a moment?

947
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,950
Are you OK?
Would you like me to go with you?

948
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,454
No, no, no. I'll be fine.
Just got a touch woozy, that's all.

949
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:42,041
Woozy, huh?

950
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,021
I'd like to place
a collect call to America, please.

951
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,700
- Hello?
- What's up?

952
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:16,204
Hal, I'm desperate. Dad's getting married.

953
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,740
What do you mean, getting married?

954
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,751
I mean black tie, white gown,
the whole enchilada.

955
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,162
- What?
<i>- The wedding's in two weeks.</i>

956
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:27,504
If there's any hope of getting Mum and Dad
back together we've got to do it fast.

957
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,009
And I mean really fast.

958
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,137
OK. So Mom and I are going out
to the theater tonight.

959
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,969
I'll drop the bomb on her
first thing in the morning.

960
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,553
<i>OK. Thanks.</i>

961
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:40,346
- And, Hallie, hurry!
- OK. I will.

962
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,974
Oh, excuse me, sir.

963
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:47,485
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh. Yes.

964
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,521
Now, what say you and I

965
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,157
take a little stroll
in the park, eh, young lady?

966
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,487
OK.

967
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:56,112
Now...

968
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:01,204
- Come on, what's this all about?
- Well, it's a long story.

969
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,961
Well, it's a very big park
and we've got plenty of time, you know.

970
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,747
Well, first of all...

971
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:11,089
<i>Féminine? Vraiment...
Je ne sais pas comment expliquer</i>

972
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,762
<i>mais vous aurez
le dessin demain, en tout cas.</i>

973
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,969
<i>En satin?
Non, non, ce sera quelque</i>

974
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,926
<i>chose plus moderne</i>

975
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:23,438
<i>avec de la dentelle, du tulle blanc
très, très jeune, très léger.</i>

976
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,023
Just do it, sweet pea.

977
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:31,488
<i>Non, c'est trop, non. Oui, mademoiselle,
vous aurez le dessin demain matin.</i>

978
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:35,025
<i>Oui, tout à fait. Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Allez, au revoir.</i>

979
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:39,037
Darling, come in. I just have to finish
this sketch and fedex it off to Paris.

980
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:41,289
Then how about you and I go out to lunch

981
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:44,623
and spend the rest of the day
getting lost in Harrods. Hm?

982
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:48,498
I can't, Mum, I'm sorry.
I have to go out of town today.

983
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,666
Oh, you have to go out of town?

984
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,381
And where,
may I ask, are you going?

985
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,381
Annie. Annie.

986
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:00,926
That's where
I have to go. I have to go see Annie.

987
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,265
I see. And where might Annie be?

988
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,227
In Napa.
With her father Nick Parker.

989
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,158
You're not Annie.

990
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,528
That would be correct.

991
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,247
You're Hallie?

992
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,076
I am.

993
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,542
Annie and I met up at camp
and we decided to switch places.

994
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:40,474
I'm sorry, but I'd never seen you,
and I dreamt of meeting you my whole life.

995
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:45,980
Annie felt the exact same way about Dad,
so we sorta just switched lives.

996
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:49,517
I hope you're not mad,
because I love you so much

997
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,937
and I just hope that one day
you can love me as me,

998
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,446
and not as Annie.

999
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:57,608
Oh, darling.

1000
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,285
I've loved you your whole life.

1001
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:12,999
I've never been so happy
in my entire life.

1002
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,171
So, I...

1003
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,931
I guess you have
to switch us back now, huh?

1004
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:29,978
Well, technically, you belong to your dad
and Annie belongs to me.

1005
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:35,271
His and hers kids. No offense, Mom,
but this arrangement really sucks.

1006
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,906
I agree. It totally sucks.

1007
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:42,661
Then I say we fly to Napa, see Annie
and Dad, and work this whole thing out.

1008
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:47,666
And I say you're right. Not to worry,
darling. I'll take care of everything.

1009
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,918
You're not to worry, OK?

1010
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:56,967
I'm sorry. I can't handle this.

1011
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,504
I mean, I haven't seen or heard
from Nick Parker in over 11 years,

1012
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:03,515
and suddenly I'm flying
halfway across the world to...

1013
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,519
I'm not mature enough for this.
If the man didn't make me so nuts,

1014
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,939
I'd still be married to him.
I mean, we came up with this arrangement

1015
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,521
so that we'd never
have to see each other again.

1016
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:16,528
I mean, look at me, Martin.
Have you ever seen me like this?

1017
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,734
- Well...
- Don't answer that.

1018
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,491
I mean, what if he doesn't recognize me?

1019
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,526
No, don't answer that, either.

1020
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,199
So, Hallie said he was a... a hunk.

1021
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,616
He was rather dishy.

1022
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,083
He had a smile that made me go weak
at the knees, if you can imagine that.

1023
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:37,667
- OK. I'm all set, Mom.
- Great. Me too. Almost.

1024
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,711
Mom, your suitcase is,
like, totally empty.

1025
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:43,380
Oh. Right. Sorry. Um...

1026
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,139
Did you speak to your father, dear?

1027
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,722
Um... Yeah, yeah.
I just hung up with him, actually.

1028
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,103
He said he's really anxious to see you.

1029
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,557
Anxious nervous,
like he's totally, completely dreading it?

1030
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,693
Or anxious excited,
like he's looking forward to it?

1031
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,445
- Anxious excited. Definitely.
- Oh.

1032
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:03,609
He said he'll meet us tomorrow at noon
at the Stafford Hotel in San Francisco.

1033
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:07,242
My, my, my. That's incredibly soon,
isn't it? Well. Um...

1034
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:09,872
Why don't you run downstairs
and gather up our tickets

1035
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,580
from your grandfather
while I finish up here?

1036
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,747
OK.

1037
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:17,088
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.
- Sh!

1038
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:21,719
Oh, Martin, I have a really ridiculous,
somewhat childish request to make.

1039
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,879
Martin, you know
that you're more than a butler to me.

1040
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,174
You're more like a lovable brother
who just happens to wait on us and...

1041
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,059
- Anyway, I was wondering if...
- I'd accompany you on the trip?

1042
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:33,438
- Make it a bit easier for you?
- Would you, Martin? Thank you so much.

1043
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,441
I'd be so grateful. And you don't even
have to come as our butler,

1044
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,567
- just as a friend.
- Madam, I'd be honored.

1045
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,603
And may I say, as a friend,

1046
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:45,367
if I was seeing my ex, after 11 years,
and I had your legs...

1047
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,657
I'd wear this little baby.

1048
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,115
You'll kill in it.

1049
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,711
- Bye, Daddy, darling.
- Bye, darling.

1050
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,172
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

1051
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,803
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye, Hal.

1052
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,933
So you're coming to Napa
for Thanksgiving, right?

1053
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,470
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1054
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,310
Bye.

1055
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,109
Oh, and say hello to your father for me.

1056
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:21,395
I will.

1057
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,201
Airport, please.

1058
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,012
OK. They'll be here any minute.

1059
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,146
Now, be nice, Daddy.

1060
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:01,185
He's everything you ever wanted
for your little girl, plus millions more.

1061
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,228
Then you know I'll be nice.

1062
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,232
Oh, OK. There he is.

1063
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,073
With the whole motley crew.

1064
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:15,198
Hi, darling.

1065
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:22,001
Hallie. Chessy. And Sammy.
What in the world are you doing here?

1066
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,040
Honey, a dog at the Stafford?

1067
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:27,461
- Hal begged me to bring him.
- Oh, you're such a softy.

1068
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:28,970
Oh!

1069
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,177
Good doggy. So, Meredith, these the folks?

1070
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,310
Yes. Mom, Dad, you finally meet.

1071
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:39,268
This is my fiancé and the love of my life,
Nicholas Parker.

1072
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,730
Hello, Nicholas.
I'm so pleased to meet you.

1073
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,690
- I'm Vicki.
- Hi.

1074
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,321
And this is Nick's
adorable daughter Hallie.

1075
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,534
This entire prenuptial get-together
was her idea, I'll have you know.

1076
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:54,743
How are you, young lady? We've heard
nothing but wonderful things about you.

1077
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:59,034
Hello, pet.
You may call me Aunt Vicki.

1078
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,598
- Other end, madam.
- Whoops.

1079
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:23,187
That was a great flight, wasn't it?
I mean, it was so quick.

1080
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,727
I've never seen you
quite so thirsty before, madam.

1081
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:29,864
Well, would you believe, Martin, darling,
I've never tasted vodka before this trip?

1082
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,366
Could have fooled me, ma'am.

1083
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,202
Come on. Let's rock and roll.

1084
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,738
I am in such major trouble here.

1085
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,914
If the hotel can do it, I think that room
is perfect for the wedding.

1086
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,543
Not too big, not too cramped.

1087
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:45,956
And not that I don't like the idea
of having the wedding at the house,

1088
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,591
it's just that this could be amazing.

1089
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:52,592
So I've already checked us in.
Why don't we go upstairs, freshen up,

1090
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,381
and then rendezvous for lunch?

1091
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:56,845
- Great.
- Meet you in the bar in ten. OK?

1092
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:58,347
Perf.

1093
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:03,606
Sweetheart, now that we're here, why don't
we go check out the honeymoon suite?

1094
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,484
I bet it is to die for.

1095
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,281
Oh, whoops. I forgot my bag.

1096
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,491
Hang on.

1097
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:19,993
Sammy.

1098
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:22,041
Sammy!

1099
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,881
- Sammy!
- Excuse me. Did you find a beige...

1100
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,041
Thank you.

1101
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,551
- Ooh.
- Mum!

1102
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:36,385
Darling, you didn't have to wait for me.
I could have found the room by myself.

1103
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,800
Besides, I need to get a little fresh air.

1104
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,352
Go on, sweetie. I'll meet you upthairs.

1105
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:45,727
I like that jacket, by the way.
Were you wearing that

1106
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,893
- the whole time we were on the plane?
- Mum, watch out!

1107
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:49,694
Sorry, sorry.

1108
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:56,201
She's drunk. She's never had more
than one glass of wine in her entire life,

1109
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,078
and she chooses today
to show up totally zonked.

1110
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:03,083
Yeah, well. Just do what the woman says
and meet her "upthairs."

1111
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,710
Maybe that's why they make
"do not disturb" signs.

1112
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:16,220
Alone at last.

1113
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:28,812
Hallie Parker.

1114
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,317
Oh, don't do this to me.
I'm already seeing double.

1115
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:37,321
- It's me, Mum. Annie.
- Oh, darling.

1116
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,036
You look wonderful.

1117
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,200
Oh, my girls.

1118
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:50,463
I can't believe you're together.
But how could you do this to me?

1119
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,592
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt, but...

1120
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:59,218
might I suggest that we continue
this little powwow inside?

1121
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,263
- Hi. You probably don't remember me.
- Chessy.

1122
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,018
I knew I always liked her.

1123
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,400
One of you... I'm not sure
which one at the moment,

1124
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:15,109
but one of you told me your father
knew I was arriving here today.

1125
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:18,400
And I'm here to tell you
that the man I just saw in the elevator

1126
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:21,490
had absolutely no idea
he and I were on the same planet,

1127
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:25,039
- let alone in the same hotel.
- You saw Dad already?

1128
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:28,668
Yes, I did.
The man went completely ashen,

1129
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:31,545
like I was
the bloody Ghost of Christmas Past.

1130
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,002
Can one of you
get something cold for my head?

1131
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,919
I mean, don't you think I've pondered
what it was going to be like

1132
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,052
to see your father
after all these years?

1133
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:41,590
Well, let me tell you,
me waving like a mindless idiot

1134
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:44,009
while Nick Parker's wrapped
around another woman's arms

1135
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:48,180
is not exactly the scenario
I had in mind. No, sirree.

1136
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,476
Martin! What are you doing?

1137
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:55,020
Going for a dip, madam.
Do you mind?

1138
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:58,110
No, no. No, that's perfectly perfect.

1139
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,991
Have fun.
Someone ought to.

1140
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,447
Hello.

1141
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,954
Hello. Hello to you.

1142
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:06,614
Chessy,
this is our butler, Martin.

1143
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,826
How do you do? I'm her butler.

1144
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,462
<i>Enchanté, mademoiselle.</i>

1145
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:17,375
Gee. The pleasure's all mine, monsieur.

1146
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,213
Girls, you were going to tell me
why you lied

1147
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,508
and brought me here
without telling your father.

1148
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:26,768
Were they? OK, that's good. Uh...

1149
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:30,351
Well, I'm just gonna go back to my room
and check out the old mini-bar situation.

1150
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:32,937
- Allow me to assist you.
- Wait.

1151
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:36,653
Does everyone here
know something I don't know?

1152
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:41,570
Mum, Daddy's getting married.

1153
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:48,331
To Cruella De Vil. She's awful, Mum.
We can't let him go through with it.

1154
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,866
She's all wrong for him, Mom,

1155
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,535
and the only way
he won't marry her is if...

1156
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,666
You tell her. She knows you better.

1157
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,588
Is if he sees you again.

1158
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:04,138
Wait a minute. You're not trying
to set me up with your father?

1159
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:07,426
Actually, we are.
You're perfect for each other.

1160
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:10,721
Hold it! You two knew about this?

1161
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:13,731
- What? Oh! No.
- No.

1162
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:17,814
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Madam, no, absolutely. I had no idea.

1163
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:22,111
- Yes. Yes, I did know something.
- Yes. Technically, yes. I had an inkling.

1164
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:24,617
- Hallie told me the story.
- It was their idea. It was so sweet.

1165
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,448
I just fell for the story.
I'm an old romantic.

1166
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:27,612
Yeah, so am I.

1167
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,155
OK. OK.

1168
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,166
Let me say this loud and clear.

1169
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,079
Nick Parker and I
have absolutely nothing in common...

1170
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:37,580
anymore.

1171
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:40,796
Plus, in case you haven't noticed,
he seems extremely content

1172
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,258
with his leggy, tight-skirted,
bare-backed fiancée.

1173
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,889
And I want the two of you
to explain to your father

1174
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,597
that I am here for one purpose,
and one purpose only.

1175
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,137
And that is
to switch the two of you back.

1176
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:55,432
Now, let's do what we have to do
and be done with it.

1177
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:56,645
Understood?

1178
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,063
- Hey, Dad. What's up?
- Hi. Just running down to the lobby.

1179
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:02,275
- Hey, Hal.
- Huh?

1180
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:05,692
Do me a favor, will ya, while I'm gone?
Will you just look after Meredith for me?

1181
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:06,859
Huh? Thanks.

1182
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,278
- Hallie. Hallie.
- Yeah?

1183
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:10,947
How do I look?
Like, presentable and everything?

1184
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,583
- Not too old?
- You look fab, Dad. Young and fab.

1185
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:24,419
Dad.

1186
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,551
I thought you were gonna
keep Meredith company.

1187
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,883
I was? I mean, I am, yeah.

1188
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,097
I was just looking for her, actually.

1189
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,058
It's great to see you, Dad.

1190
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,065
It's great to see you too, squirt.

1191
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,023
- Nice outfit.
- Oh, thanks.

1192
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,321
Well, go on. Get up there. Come on.

1193
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,150
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1194
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,694
<i>Why don't you and I combine?</i>

1195
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,992
<i>Let's get together...</i>

1196
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,202
- Have you seen your father?
- You talking to me?

1197
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:57,540
What, are you Robert De Niro?
Yes, I am talking to you.

1198
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:00,126
Oh, Meredith.

1199
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:04,008
- Uh... Yeah. I just saw him.
- Well, hello. Where was he?

1200
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:06,510
Uh... He went thataway. I think.

1201
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,850
- What are you staring at?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

1202
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:20,141
You're just really very pretty.
That's all.

1203
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:21,308
Oh...

1204
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:25,196
Don't tell me you're gonna break your
rotten streak and suddenly be nice to me.

1205
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,608
If you see your father,
tell him he's late and I'm waiting.

1206
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,575
Whatever you say, Cruella.

1207
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:44,461
Here you go.
This'll cure anything you've got.

1208
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,131
- Just don't ask what's in it.
- OK.

1209
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,468
Here's to...

1210
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:56,553
Here's to you. May your life be
far less complicated than mine.

1211
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,138
Thank you.

1212
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,056
Ugh.

1213
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,110
Martini, dry, please.

1214
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:08,989
I beg your pardon.
I think I just drank tar.

1215
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:13,244
There's your martini,
and your bill, Miss James.

1216
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:14,574
Thank you.

1217
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,290
You're Elizabeth James?

1218
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:29,210
- Guilty.
- Oh!

1219
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,845
I just saw a wedding dress
you designed in <i>Vogue</i>

1220
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,881
and fell completely in love with it.

1221
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,517
I faxed your office just yesterday,
and they said that you were out of town

1222
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:40,643
and didn't know if you could make another.
I can't believe it. It's fate.

1223
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,524
- I'm Meredith Blake.
- How do you do?

1224
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,161
Sorry.

1225
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:02,876
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1226
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,415
Where have you been?
We've been looking all over for you.

1227
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:10,300
Nicholas, I think this hotel
is perfect for the wedding.

1228
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,713
- The more I see of it, the more I like it.
- Me too.

1229
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,136
Absolutely.

1230
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:23,105
Now, tell me, dear. How many are we
expecting from your side of the family?

1231
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:24,686
Just a guesstimate.

1232
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:29,187
Uh... Can I get back to you on that?
I... I'm not sure at the moment.

1233
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:31,906
Excuse me.

1234
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,651
Pardon me. Sorry.

1235
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:39,363
- Oh! Boss, you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1236
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:42,284
- Uh... Sir.
- Dad, watch out!

1237
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,294
- Oh! Careful!
- Argh!

1238
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,777
- Hello, Liz.
- Hello, Nick.

1239
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,778
Well, gosh. There you are.
What do you know?

1240
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:18,285
Uh... Is there something going on here
that I should know about?

1241
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,697
Because I'm stunned to see you.

1242
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:24,367
But, uh... you don't seem
as stunned to see me.

1243
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:29,961
I mean, I haven't seen or heard from you
in, what, ten, eleven years.

1244
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:32,959
- All of a sudden, on the very day that...
- Dad.

1245
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:35,423
I can explain why she's here.

1246
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,214
Hallie, you know who this is?

1247
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:42,886
Actually, yes.
And, actually, I'm not Hallie.

1248
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:46,097
Actually, I am.

1249
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,349
Both of them?

1250
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:52,857
Annie?

1251
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:54,688
Hallie?

1252
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:59,361
I guess you and Mum kind of think alike,
'cause you both sent us to the same camp.

1253
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:03,622
We met there, and the whole thing
just sort of spilled out.

1254
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,455
They switched places on us, Nick.

1255
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:10,087
You mean I've had Annie with me
all this time?

1256
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:15,047
Well, I wanted to know what you were like,
and Hallie wanted to know Mum, and...

1257
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,172
- Are you angry?
- Oh, honey. Of course not.

1258
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:22,220
I just can't believe it's you.

1259
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:29,349
Last time I saw you, you had diaper rash.
Oh, sorry - you're all wet.

1260
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:31,267
- It's all right.
- Look at you.

1261
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:36,944
Well, I'm quite grown-up now,
and quite without a father.

1262
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:40,242
And I'm headed into my crazy,
mixed-up teenage years,

1263
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:43,655
and I'll be the only girl I know
without a mother to fight with.

1264
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,287
Hallie, you've been in London
all this time?

1265
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,127
Come here, squirt.

1266
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:58,882
Mom's amazing, Dad.
I don't know how you ever let her go.

1267
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:05,010
Girls, why don't you let your father and I
talk alone for a couple of minutes, OK?

1268
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:08,395
- Sure, fine.
- Take your time.

1269
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,599
I don't believe this.

1270
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:16,403
Seeing them together, seeing you.

1271
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:19,156
- Ow.
- Ooh. Let me help you with that.

1272
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:21,032
Oh, excuse me.
Do you have a first-aid kit?

1273
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,534
Yeah, of course.

1274
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:25,741
Why don't you lie down?

1275
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,034
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1276
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:33,079
So... how are you, Lizzie?

1277
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:36,416
Or does everyone call you Elizabeth now?

1278
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:39,384
Oh, no, no. Lizzie's... Lizzie's fine.

1279
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,841
- My dad still calls me Lizzie.
- Yeah?

1280
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:44,428
- Yeah, I've been... uh, been terrific.
- Oh.

1281
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:49,728
You know, you haven't changed a bit.

1282
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:54,734
Finally. There you are.
Oh! Uh... Oh, good. You've met.

1283
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:58,776
Honey, Elizabeth designs wedding gowns,
and she's going to make my...

1284
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:03,113
Wait, um... I don't understand.
How did you two meet?

1285
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,661
And, Nicky, why are you all wet?

1286
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,662
You're making my fiancée's wedding gown.

1287
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:10,074
- Well, I didn't know she was your fiancée.
- Well...

1288
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,459
How did we meet?
How did you two meet?

1289
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:17,294
- Am I missing something here?
- Know what? This is one small world.

1290
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:18,924
How small?

1291
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:20,960
- Hi, Mer.
- Hello.

1292
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:24,301
How you doing?

1293
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:28,009
Honey, did I ever mention to you
that Hallie was a twin?

1294
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:31,972
No, I'm afraid
you forgot that little detail.

1295
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:35,391
Don't feel bad, Mer,
he never mentioned it to me, either.

1296
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:38,902
By the way, I'm the real Hallie.
This is Annie.

1297
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:42,861
She was pretending to be me,
while I was pretending to be her.

1298
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:47,449
And this is our mother, Elizabeth James.

1299
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,363
This is your mother?

1300
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:50,577
Yes.

1301
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,491
You were married to him?

1302
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:54,702
- Yeah.
- Guilty again.

1303
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:58,964
- Oh, well. This is a small world.
- And getting smaller.

1304
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:03,299
And what a coincidence that we're all here
on the exact same weekend.

1305
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:07,260
My, my, my. How sweet.

1306
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:15,807
Hal, I've had enough surprises
for one day.

1307
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,397
Will you please
just tell me where we're going?

1308
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:21,153
You're gonna love it, Dad. Trust me.

1309
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:24,065
Hello.

1310
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,201
Hey.

1311
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:33,624
So...

1312
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:37,203
Do you have any idea
where they're taking us?

1313
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,963
- Not a clue.
- Right.

1314
01:34:58,234 --> 01:34:59,475
Where are we?

1315
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,822
This is where we're eating?

1316
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:08,450
No, actually,

1317
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,786
that's where we're eating.

1318
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,539
She's ours for the night.

1319
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:20,496
Wow. So how exactly
are we paying for this?

1320
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,960
Well, we pooled our allowances.

1321
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:27,299
- Yeah, right, Annie.
- OK. Grandfather chipped in a bit.

1322
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,673
- Annie.
- OK. He chipped in a lot.

1323
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,933
Come on.
You guys are gonna love it.

1324
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:34,510
Pretty snazzy.

1325
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:39,649
Elizabeth and Nick,
your dinner awaits you.

1326
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:48,611
Girls.

1327
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:58,617
The table's only set for two.

1328
01:35:58,795 --> 01:36:04,666
Oh. That's the other part of the surprise.
We're not joining you.

1329
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:08,795
- You're not?
- No, but I am.

1330
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:11,968
Good evening. I'm Chessy,
and I'll be your server this evening.

1331
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:15,430
- No wisecracks, please.
- And I am Martin, your sommelier.

1332
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,679
May I offer you both a taste of the bubbly

1333
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:20,222
in the hope
that you'll get a bit schnockered

1334
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,359
and not fire this lovely lady and myself

1335
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:27,067
for following the orders
of these audacious 11-year-olds?

1336
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,573
Annie, mood music, please.

1337
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:41,494
Just relax. Sail through time.

1338
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:44,129
Back to yesteryear.

1339
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,468
- You do get all this, don't you?
- Yes, I'm beginning to.

1340
01:36:57,103 --> 01:37:00,562
They're recreating the night we met.
The boat, the music...

1341
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:02,064
The help.

1342
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,649
It's so sweet.

1343
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:06,685
Martin, I think I'll take that drink.

1344
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,065
Thank you, Martin.

1345
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,826
Oh. Yeah.

1346
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:23,331
To tell you the truth,
I haven't been on a boat since the <i>QE2.</i>

1347
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:24,836
Neither have I.

1348
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:29,004
Well, then, here's to, uh...

1349
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:30,463
Our daughters.

1350
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:33,379
Our daughters.

1351
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:42,305
Now I know how a goldfish feels.

1352
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:47,768
You know, sometime
if we're ever really alone,

1353
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:52,736
maybe we could talk about
what happened between us.

1354
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,860
It all feels a bit hazy to me now.

1355
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:58,578
It ended so fast.

1356
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:01,415
It started so fast.

1357
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:03,701
Well, that part I remember perfectly.

1358
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:10,757
Looks like things are heating up
quite nicely.

1359
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:13,510
I'd say it's safe
to serve the vichyssoise.

1360
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,341
You ladle, I'll serve.

1361
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:20,805
I'm sorry.

1362
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:28,225
Yes, I'll ladle.

1363
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:31,733
Right. And then I'll...

1364
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:35,448
- Serve?
- Right.

1365
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:36,734
Right.

1366
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:42,240
So... you've done
fantastically well.

1367
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:47,207
Your dream of owning your own vineyard,
it actually came true.

1368
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:51,499
What about you? You were always drawing
on napkins and corners of newspapers.

1369
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:53,838
Now you're this major designer.

1370
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:55,252
Yeah. It's great.

1371
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:59,298
We both actually got
where we wanted to go.

1372
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,967
Yeah. We did.

1373
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:07,556
Anyway, what are we going to do
about the girls?

1374
01:39:07,733 --> 01:39:10,476
Well, now that they've met,
we can't very well keep them apart.

1375
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:14,067
Well, I could keep them for half the year,
and then you could keep them for...

1376
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:17,654
Guys, they can't go to two
different schools every year. That's nuts.

1377
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:18,908
I agree.

1378
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:21,661
Well, I could keep them both
for a whole year, and you...

1379
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:24,323
- Liz, that's why we came up with...
- Mm-mm. Mm-hm.

1380
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:29,753
Oh. Sorry. Ignore me. Enjoy your soup.

1381
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:33,169
That's why we came up
with the solution that we have.

1382
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:38,838
Really? I thought it was because
we decided never to see each other again.

1383
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:40,802
Not "we," Liz.

1384
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:45,140
Well, you know, that part's become
a bit hazy to me too over the years.

1385
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:49,182
- You don't remember the day you packed?
- No, that day I remember perfectly.

1386
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:53,523
Did I hurt you when I threw that, um...
What was it? A...

1387
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:55,904
It was a hairdryer.

1388
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:57,314
Oh. Right.

1389
01:39:58,534 --> 01:39:59,650
Sorry.

1390
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:05,952
You know, I may never
be alone with you again.

1391
01:40:07,126 --> 01:40:11,837
So, about that day that you packed...
Why'd you do it?

1392
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:17,635
Oh, Nick. We were so young
and we both had tempers.

1393
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:20,762
We said stupid things and so I packed.

1394
01:40:20,932 --> 01:40:24,141
Got on my very first 747 and...

1395
01:40:25,478 --> 01:40:27,140
You didn't come after me.

1396
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:30,977
I didn't know that you wanted me to.

1397
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:35,819
Well, it really doesn't matter anymore.

1398
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:39,482
So let's just put a good face on
for the girls

1399
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:41,571
and get this show on the road, huh?

1400
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:47,035
Yeah. Sure.
Let's get this show on the road.

1401
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:57,041
Your passport, Ms. James.
Have a safe trip home.

1402
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:58,299
Thank you.

1403
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:02,675
- All set, then? Where's Annie?
- I just rang up. She's on her way down.

1404
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:04,093
Right.

1405
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:09,178
So I'll send Hallie back to you
over Christmas.

1406
01:41:09,355 --> 01:41:11,438
And Annie'll spend Easter with you.

1407
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:20,568
Annie, what are you doing in those
clothes? We've got a plane to catch.

1408
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:25,452
Here's the deal, Mom. We thought it over,
and we decided we're being totally gypped.

1409
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:30,036
Dad promised we'd go on our camping trip,
and we wanna go. Together.

1410
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:31,325
What camping trip?

1411
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:34,085
The one we go on
every summer before school starts.

1412
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:36,668
Annie, this is ridiculous.
Go upstairs and put your clothes on.

1413
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:39,750
- Are you sure I'm Annie?
- Well, of course I'm sure.

1414
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:43,091
But it's kind of hard
to be 100 percent positive, isn't it?

1415
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:47,554
Girls, this is totally unfunny. You're
gonna make your mother miss her airplane.

1416
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:49,509
- Annie.
- Yes?

1417
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:59,645
This one's Hallie. I'm positive.

1418
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:01,484
You know, I hope you're right, Dad,

1419
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:05,196
because you wouldn't wanna send
the wrong kid all the way back to England.

1420
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:07,528
Would you?

1421
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:16,169
Here's our proposition.

1422
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:20,298
We go back to Dad's house,
pack our stuff,

1423
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:23,336
and the four of us
leave on the camping trip.

1424
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,054
- The four of us?
- And when you bring us back,

1425
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:27,839
we'll tell you who's Annie
and who's Hallie.

1426
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:32,102
Or you do as we say, and I take
one of you back with me to London,

1427
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:33,887
whether you like it or not.

1428
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:43,647
And what am I supposed to do
for three days? Sit home and knit?

1429
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:46,366
Honey, we have kind of a sticky situation.

1430
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:51,280
Sticky situation? What do you mean,
sticky situation? What exactly...?

1431
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,784
Excuse me. What is she doing here?

1432
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:57,577
You see, that's part of the deal.

1433
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:01,920
- The four of us, we go together.
- What are you, suddenly the Brady Bunch?

1434
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:04,551
- This is ridic...
- Hello. Everything all right?

1435
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:07,174
Well, no, actually, it isn't.

1436
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:10,136
I didn't realize that you were
going on this little outing,

1437
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:13,598
and to tell you the truth
I'm not so sure that I'm OK with it.

1438
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:18,106
I agree. I think the ex-wife in the next
sleeping bag is a little weird.

1439
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:19,349
Thank you.

1440
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:22,481
I absolutely insist
that you come with us. Really.

1441
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:25,363
- Liz...
- No, honestly, Nick,

1442
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:28,276
I've messed up your entire weekend.
It's the least I can do.

1443
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:29,818
Really. Please.

1444
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:45,759
- Dad, what's Meredith doing here?
- Your mother invited her.

1445
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,089
What?

1446
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:48,962
Be nice.

1447
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:03,818
OK. All set? Have fun, everyone.

1448
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,026
- What?
- Liz, what are you doing?

1449
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:11,618
Well, I really think that you and Meredith
need some time alone before the big day.

1450
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,994
Mom, come on. That's not the plan.

1451
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,373
Oh, honestly,
you'll have much more fun without me.

1452
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:19,034
Wait, wait. If you're not going,
I certainly don't have to go.

1453
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:21,794
I mean, trust me,
I'm not a big nature girl.

1454
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:24,297
But this is your chance
to really get to know the girls.

1455
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:28,086
I mean, after all, starting next week
they're... they're half yours.

1456
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:35,842
Have fun, all of you.

1457
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:42,644
Bye-bye.

1458
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,853
Oh, I would pay big money
to see that woman climb a mountain.

1459
01:44:49,158 --> 01:44:51,150
- Don't hurry, honey.
- OK.

1460
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:57,071
Whoa!

1461
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:58,957
Come on, you guys.

1462
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:00,993
Whoa. Whoa.

1463
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,051
I'm gonna kill my trainer.

1464
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:20,642
He says I'm in such great shape.

1465
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:23,936
I can't believe
people actually do this for fun.

1466
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:27,359
Hold on. We're stopping.

1467
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:32,529
Again? Dad, at this rate it'll take us
three days just to get to the lake.

1468
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:35,528
Meredith isn't used
to the altitude. Just chill.

1469
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,032
OK?

1470
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:46,372
Oh, I'm in serious pain.
Somebody hand me my Evian.

1471
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:48,460
I can't move.

1472
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,376
Sure.

1473
01:45:56,392 --> 01:45:57,508
Brilliant.

1474
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:04,188
Here you go, Mer.

1475
01:46:12,825 --> 01:46:14,566
Honey, you OK?

1476
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:19,078
- What happened?
- This little guy was on her Evian bottle.

1477
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:21,160
Oh. He won't hurt you, Mer.

1478
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:24,664
Oh, right, right, right.
I... I know. You...

1479
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:28,755
go ahead. I'll be fine.

1480
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:34,674
Get that thing away from me.
I hate things that crawl. Ugh.

1481
01:46:34,847 --> 01:46:37,305
How can you touch that?
Just... put it down.

1482
01:46:37,516 --> 01:46:39,508
OK, OK, I'll put it down.

1483
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:44,346
- Girls...
- What?

1484
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:46,515
- What?
- I'm going to take the lead.

1485
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:48,979
The two of you help Meredith. All right?

1486
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,984
Sure you'll help me.
Right over a cliff, you'll help me.

1487
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:57,742
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah. See any cliffs?

1488
01:46:57,912 --> 01:47:00,074
Oh, my backpack.

1489
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:02,372
Need a hand, Mer?

1490
01:47:04,126 --> 01:47:06,459
Not from you, thank you.

1491
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:09,754
Don't think I can't see
right past those angelic faces.

1492
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:13,759
One more trick from you two and I promise
I will make your lives miserable

1493
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:16,386
from the day I say, "I do."

1494
01:47:17,348 --> 01:47:18,555
Got it?

1495
01:47:20,059 --> 01:47:21,766
Got it, Cruella.

1496
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:25,557
What did you call me?

1497
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:29,983
Nothing, nothing.
Not a thing, Cruella.

1498
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:34,776
Oh, by the way, Mer,
I think there's something on your head.

1499
01:47:50,506 --> 01:47:51,622
Are you all right?

1500
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:58,215
What... happened?

1501
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:02,758
Ask them.

1502
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:11,354
What did we do, Dad?
We were right behind you.

1503
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:16,404
- This is really good.
- Yeah, I know.

1504
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:20,033
Here we go, girls.
This'll hold us for a while.

1505
01:48:25,082 --> 01:48:26,914
Sure you don't want some trout, Mom?

1506
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:29,701
Is that OK, by the way,
if we start calling you Mom?

1507
01:48:30,295 --> 01:48:33,208
I think your mother would prefer
if you called me Meredith.

1508
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:38,719
And no, thank you, I do not eat trout,
for the thousandth time.

1509
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:41,925
I will wait until breakfast.
What are we having?

1510
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:44,136
- Trout.
- Oh.

1511
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:47,427
- Come on, it's part of the experience.
- Mm, and what's the other part?

1512
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:49,516
Being eaten to death by mosquitoes?

1513
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:52,148
God, you'd think
they actually like this stuff.

1514
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:54,901
Well, what's that you're using?
Here, let me see that.

1515
01:48:59,825 --> 01:49:01,862
You're gonna attract
every mosquito in the state

1516
01:49:02,036 --> 01:49:05,074
with this stuff. It's sugar
and water. Where'd you get it?

1517
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:13,166
That's it. I am taking one large
sleeping pill and going to bed.

1518
01:49:20,137 --> 01:49:21,218
Meredith?

1519
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:23,513
What are you doing?

1520
01:49:24,141 --> 01:49:25,928
I don't want the mountain lions to...

1521
01:49:28,604 --> 01:49:31,347
There are no mountain lions
up here, are there?

1522
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:34,016
No.

1523
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:51,828
Good night.

1524
01:49:57,091 --> 01:50:00,209
Girls, I'm telling you, lay off.

1525
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:04,174
This isn't her thing, OK? I'm not
marrying her because she's Annie Oakley.

1526
01:50:04,473 --> 01:50:07,762
- Who's Annie Oakley?
- Just cool it.

1527
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:27,827
- Come on, come on.
- OK.

1528
01:50:29,915 --> 01:50:33,079
I hope
that one large sleeping pill worked.

1529
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,717
- You take that side.
- All right.

1530
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:47,551
Gosh, she's heavy.

1531
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:49,681
She's also, like, snoring.

1532
01:50:58,777 --> 01:51:00,018
Nicky?

1533
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:30,052
Sweet dreams, Mommy dearest.

1534
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,985
That feels nice.

1535
01:52:01,673 --> 01:52:04,962
Nicky!

1536
01:52:08,055 --> 01:52:09,591
Oh, man.

1537
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:12,223
Ooh.

1538
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:30,404
- What's going on?
- Here's what's going on, buddy.

1539
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:34,283
The day we get married is the day
I ship those brats off to Switzerland.

1540
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:37,620
Get the picture? It's me or them.

1541
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,292
Take your pick.

1542
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:43,124
Them.

1543
01:52:43,966 --> 01:52:47,960
- Excuse me?
- T-h-e-m, them.

1544
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:51,004
Get the picture?

1545
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:12,366
Hello. You're back so soon.
Did you have fun?

1546
01:53:12,577 --> 01:53:16,036
- Well, I wouldn't go right to fun.
- You wouldn't?

1547
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,823
We've been punished
to the end of the century.

1548
01:53:19,001 --> 01:53:21,618
Starting now. Go.

1549
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:23,620
Where's Meredith?

1550
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:26,039
We played a couple
of harmless tricks on her

1551
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,832
and she kind of freaked out a little.

1552
01:53:28,093 --> 01:53:29,174
A little?

1553
01:53:30,429 --> 01:53:31,465
Hm.

1554
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:35,010
She threw this at my head.

1555
01:53:36,393 --> 01:53:38,259
Least it's smaller than a hairdryer.

1556
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:42,105
Oh, Nick, it's all my fault.
If I hadn't suggested she go...

1557
01:53:42,274 --> 01:53:44,982
Oh, tricked.
Tricked would be more like it.

1558
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:47,352
Like mother, like daughters.

1559
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:49,695
I really am sorry.

1560
01:53:50,032 --> 01:53:52,399
- We are too, Dad. Really.
- Yeah.

1561
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:55,114
Up to your room. Now.

1562
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:03,452
I gotta remember to thank them one day.

1563
01:54:08,216 --> 01:54:10,424
So, where's Chessy? I'm starving.

1564
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:17,057
Well, she and Martin went off
on a picnic around noon... yesterday.

1565
01:54:17,351 --> 01:54:21,391
Really? Who would have thought?
My nanny, your butler. Hm.

1566
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:25,473
So, what do you say
I whip us up something to eat?

1567
01:54:25,942 --> 01:54:29,606
- You can cook now?
- Oh, yeah. I can make pasta

1568
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,521
and pasta and...

1569
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,523
Pasta sounds good.

1570
01:54:33,992 --> 01:54:35,233
Pasta it is.

1571
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:43,286
OK, I'll take two.

1572
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:49,005
- Hey, Dad.
- Wow, you look so nice.

1573
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:50,798
Where are you going?

1574
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:53,171
Good night, ladies.

1575
01:55:01,978 --> 01:55:03,514
Oh, wow.

1576
01:55:03,688 --> 01:55:05,975
This is where I keep my private stash.

1577
01:55:06,483 --> 01:55:09,271
- Did you know I also collect wine?
- Really?

1578
01:55:09,444 --> 01:55:11,731
Mm. I'm a man of limited interests.
Come here.

1579
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:17,984
This is a 1921 Burgundy.

1580
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:22,409
They say the rain that year made this
the best Burgundy ever harvested.

1581
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:23,952
Oh.

1582
01:55:25,127 --> 01:55:27,335
Now, you will appreciate this. Come here.

1583
01:55:37,347 --> 01:55:38,428
Look.

1584
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:42,266
V-J Day 1945.

1585
01:55:42,853 --> 01:55:45,186
- That's incredible.
- I love that.

1586
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:54,275
Now, this is the same wine
that was served at my parents' wedding.

1587
01:55:54,448 --> 01:55:56,030
Bordeaux, '52.

1588
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:59,192
I think my sister
was conceived on this baby.

1589
01:56:02,289 --> 01:56:08,206
What's this one?
"Where dreams have no end." 1983.

1590
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:11,337
That one, actually,
took me years to track down.

1591
01:56:11,756 --> 01:56:13,042
Why? Where's it from?

1592
01:56:15,469 --> 01:56:18,428
It's the wine that we drank
at our wedding.

1593
01:56:21,057 --> 01:56:23,265
I now have every bottle ever made.

1594
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,556
You do?

1595
01:56:28,273 --> 01:56:29,389
I do.

1596
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:36,688
- Can we open one?
- You're the only one I'd drink it with.

1597
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:42,284
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah.

1598
01:56:42,662 --> 01:56:44,995
Just got a little dust
in my eye, that's all.

1599
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:48,875
- I can offer you a clean sleeve.
- No, no, I'm fine, really.

1600
01:56:49,211 --> 01:56:50,372
All better.

1601
01:56:52,964 --> 01:56:55,798
You don't always
have to be so brave, you know.

1602
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,592
Oh, but I do, actually.

1603
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:09,353
That will be Chessy.

1604
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:12,106
She has a key.

1605
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:26,529
Hello? Anybody home?

1606
01:57:29,501 --> 01:57:30,742
We'll be right up.

1607
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:57,602
<i>Oh</i>

1608
01:57:58,071 --> 01:58:00,529
<i>Every time</i>

1609
01:58:02,617 --> 01:58:05,530
<i>We say goodbye</i>

1610
01:58:07,247 --> 01:58:10,991
<i>I die a little</i>

1611
01:58:12,669 --> 01:58:15,161
<i>Every time</i>

1612
01:58:16,506 --> 01:58:20,170
<i>We say goodbye</i>

1613
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:25,755
<i>I wonder why a little</i>

1614
01:58:27,142 --> 01:58:31,477
<i>Why the gods above me</i>

1615
01:58:32,856 --> 01:58:39,820
<i>Who must be in the know</i>

1616
01:58:42,282 --> 01:58:45,946
<i>Think so little of me...</i>

1617
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:47,576
Take care of yourself.

1618
01:58:48,038 --> 01:58:50,451
Yeah, I will. You too.

1619
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:55,744
Bye.

1620
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:06,671
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1621
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:14,182
<i>I can hear</i>

1622
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:19,730
<i>A lark somewhere</i>

1623
01:59:20,362 --> 01:59:25,983
<i>Begin to sing about it</i>

1624
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:31,495
<i>There's no love song finer</i>

1625
01:59:32,916 --> 01:59:36,626
<i>But how strange the change</i>

1626
01:59:37,587 --> 01:59:41,547
<i>From major to minor</i>

1627
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:45,335
<i>Every time</i>

1628
01:59:46,137 --> 01:59:50,848
<i>We say goodbye</i>

1629
02:00:05,907 --> 02:00:08,399
Hello? We're home.

1630
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:10,117
Grandfather?

1631
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:12,240
I'll check the study.

1632
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:21,503
Hey, stranger.

1633
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:28,377
Hey, Mom. Did you know that Concorde
gets you here in half the time?

1634
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:31,179
Yes, I've heard that.

1635
02:00:34,561 --> 02:00:36,302
What are you doing here?

1636
02:00:36,563 --> 02:00:39,180
It took us around 30 seconds
after you guys left

1637
02:00:39,357 --> 02:00:41,940
for us to realize
we didn't wanna lose you two again.

1638
02:00:43,194 --> 02:00:44,230
We?

1639
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:49,694
We.

1640
02:00:51,995 --> 02:00:54,783
I made the mistake of not coming
after you once, Lizzie.

1641
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:59,041
I'm not gonna do that again,
no matter how brave you are.

1642
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:05,335
And I suppose you just expect me to go
weak at the knees and fall into your arms

1643
02:01:05,508 --> 02:01:08,797
and cry hysterically and say,
"We'll just figure this whole thing out."

1644
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:10,677
A bicontinental relationship

1645
02:01:10,847 --> 02:01:14,807
with our daughters being raised
here and... and there and...

1646
02:01:15,685 --> 02:01:19,349
and you and I just picking up
where we left off and...

1647
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:23,057
and growing old together and...

1648
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:25,814
and...

1649
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,146
Come on, Nick, what do you expect?

1650
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,903
- To live happily ever after?
- Yes.

1651
02:01:32,869 --> 02:01:34,360
To all the above.

1652
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:37,287
Except you don't have to cry hysterically.

1653
02:01:38,917 --> 02:01:40,579
Oh, yes, I do.

1654
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:20,285
We actually did it.

1655
02:02:22,377 --> 02:02:23,913
<i>This will be</i>

1656
02:02:24,045 --> 02:02:25,661
<i>An everlasting love</i>

1657
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:29,123
<i>This will be the one I've waited for</i>

1658
02:02:29,676 --> 02:02:30,792
<i>This will be</i>

1659
02:02:31,177 --> 02:02:35,342
<i>The first time anyone has loved me</i>

1660
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:41,017
<i>I'm so glad you found me in time</i>

1661
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:44,851
<i>And I'm so glad that
you rectified my mind</i>

1662
02:02:45,024 --> 02:02:46,105
<i>This will be</i>

1663
02:02:46,985 --> 02:02:50,695
<i>An everlasting love for me, yeah</i>

1664
02:02:50,905 --> 02:02:52,487
<i>Whoa</i>

1665
02:02:52,657 --> 02:02:56,241
<i>Loving you
is some kind of wonderful</i>

1666
02:02:56,452 --> 02:03:00,116
<i>Because you've shown me
just how much you care</i>

1667
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:03,374
<i>You've given me
the thrill of a lifetime</i>

1668
02:03:03,543 --> 02:03:07,036
<i>And made me believe
you've got more thrills to spare</i>

1669
02:03:07,213 --> 02:03:09,079
<i>Oh, this will be</i>

1670
02:03:09,841 --> 02:03:12,584
<i>An everlasting love</i>

1671
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:14,752
<i>Oh, yes, it will, now</i>

1672
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:22,559
