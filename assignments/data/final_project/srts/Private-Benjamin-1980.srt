1
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:39,008
With this ring be thou consecrated
unto me as my wife.

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,886
According to the law of Moses
and faith of Israel.

3
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,931
According to the law of Moses
and faith of Israel.

4
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:48,143
And you, Judy,
say to Yale these words.

5
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:49,812
Take the ring.

6
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:55,776
This ring is a symbol
that you are my husband.

7
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:58,405
This ring is a symbol
that you are my husband.

8
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:00,824
And a sign of my love and devotion.

9
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:02,951
And a sign of my love and devotion.

10
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:05,537
In the presence of these witnesses...

11
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:08,081
...you spoke words
and performed the rites...

12
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:10,459
...which unite your lives.

13
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,212
I therefore declare you,
Yale and Judy...

14
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:15,715
...husband and wife.

15
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:18,551
Step on it.

16
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:22,472
Mazel tov!

17
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:37,739
PRIVATE BENJAMIN

18
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:17,598
But I only have eyes

19
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:20,560
For you

20
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,731
Judy Goodman

21
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:25,441
Do you have a date?

22
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:29,570
No, I told your Uncle Phil
I'd meet him to look at his lease.

23
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,907
- You're not going to work now?
- No, I'm not going to work.

24
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:36,161
He thinks he's getting evicted.
Let me just talk to him.

25
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:37,704
Okay?

26
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:41,416
- Thanks for marrying me.
- You're welcome.

27
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,378
Get me a Perrier with a twist?

28
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:54,181
- Arnie!
- So you did it, huh?

29
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:57,976
I can't believe you married Goodman...

30
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:00,103
...when you could've had me.

31
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:02,773
I could have lived with you, Arnie.

32
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:04,901
Big difference.

33
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,696
Judy!

34
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:13,911
Look who I found!
Mr. Waxman, the upholsterer.

35
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:18,415
I didn't recognize you
without nails in your mouth.

36
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:23,128
I brought a little something
I think you're going to love.

37
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:35,226
Mr. Waxman, you finished the ottoman!

38
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,978
Yale will be thrilled.

39
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:41,732
Wait a minute!
Is this mushroom piping?

40
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,861
Looks beige-y to me, Ma.
This isn't the right color, is it?

41
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:46,238
Ben...

42
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:48,365
...what happened to the mushroom?

43
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:52,202
That's as close as you're going
to get to mushroom in Philadelphia.

44
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:55,415
Mr. Waxman, we've been
through this a zillion times.

45
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:58,793
I told you I'm doing Yale's study
in mushroom.

46
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:03,089
I'm sure you could've found
a yard of mushroom fabric.

47
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:06,885
You want it, I'll get it.

48
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:09,471
This is your night!

49
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,933
Wheels?!

50
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,729
Mr. Waxman, I wanted upholstered balls.

51
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,733
Upholstered balls?

52
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:32,663
- Come on, Peanut.
- Where're we going?

53
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:34,874
- My feet hurt.
- Your feet will be fine.

54
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:36,418
I just want to talk to you.

55
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,346
What? Want a divorce already?

56
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,724
Darling, I have a very bad headache.

57
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:54,145
No wonder, you've danced all night.
I'll get some Tylenol from Mom.

58
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,354
Sweetheart...

59
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,733
...it's not a Tylenol headache.

60
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,402
- Honey!
- Please?

61
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,781
- Honey, not here!
- Please, why not? Come on!

62
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,825
Why? Because everybody
I know is ten feet away.

63
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:10,288
- They're having a good time. Please?
- No, I'll ruin my dress.

64
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:14,209
- Your dress is fine. Come on!
- Honey, please? I don't want to.

65
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,840
Kiss me first.

66
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,067
I love you so much.

67
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:38,694
Hi, Yale.

68
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,282
Judy's always been
a good girl. Always!

69
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:46,077
She made a mistake
with the first husband.

70
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:50,416
That's ancient history. The smartest
thing she ever did was to marry you.

71
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,542
That's nice, Teddy.

72
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,128
It's very important
for a father to know...

73
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:57,756
...his daughter's going to be
well taken care of. Don't laugh!

74
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:01,261
You'll know what I mean
when your daughter gets married.

75
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:03,388
Anyway, that's number one.

76
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:04,973
Number two!

77
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:07,016
We'll still have Sunday breakfasts?

78
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:09,061
- Of course, Daddy.
- Good.

79
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,731
You can get the whitefish
on your way over.

80
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,318
I want to give you two
a little something from mother and me...

81
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,028
...a little extra happiness.

82
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:23,785
I guess it's not
carpeting for the living room.

83
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:30,293
That's for the future, not
Lord and Taylor, you little jerk!

84
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,049
Teddy, you're amazing!

85
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:39,510
It's my pleasure.
Just use it in good health.

86
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,180
Thanks, Mom.

87
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,599
I'll show my mother,
she'll go crazy!

88
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:46,101
I can't believe it!

89
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:50,106
Jude, get me a cigarette.

90
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,113
Coming back inside, Daddy?

91
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,493
I just want to see the recap
of tonight's game.

92
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:03,120
Should I wait for you here?

93
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,126
Dad?

94
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:12,380
Get me a match, doll.

95
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:29,524
Jerry, if you call her you'll
screw it up. That's my job, all right?

96
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:30,650
No, to call her.

97
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,030
How long you married? Anything more
than 15 years, you lose the house.

98
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:38,158
It's not my rule,
that's just the way it is.

99
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,411
Keep the boat, it's a male item.

100
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:45,625
Prenups is the only way
to get around this and it's too late.

101
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:48,837
Give her the microwave,
it's a built-in!

102
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:52,133
It comes with the house.
What'll you do with one oven?

103
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:55,553
It's late now.
6:30 a.m. Monday...

104
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:59,598
...we'll play racquetball. We'll
figure it out then. Can you wait?

105
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,185
We'll be in Jamaica
6:30 Monday.

106
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:04,104
I'll be on my honeymoon Monday.

107
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,064
I'll call you from Jamaica.

108
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,066
I don't know, from the hotel.

109
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,903
No, you'll be halved at worst.
You're okay.

110
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,906
Prenups, babe!

111
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:19,871
- That'll never happen to us.
- I know.

112
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:24,126
- Did this bathroom turn out gorgeous?
- This ass is gorgeous.

113
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:25,878
Come here.

114
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:30,299
- What?
- Wait, honey.

115
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,468
Wait just one second.

116
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:35,138
- Lift your back leg.
- I don't have a back leg.

117
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:40,060
It's our wedding night. It's not
real romantic making love in the sink.

118
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,689
- It's romantic making love anywhere.
- I know. I love you.

119
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:48,277
- Let's go into the bedroom.
- We're going into the bedroom next.

120
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:51,405
Just here. Good, sweetie!

121
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,282
Honey, good!

122
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,788
You're on my hair,
get off my hair.

123
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:00,123
How's that?

124
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,804
- Oh, honey!
- What?

125
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,976
- Oh, sweetie!
- What?

126
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:20,229
I'm coming!

127
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,912
Why don't we go and get in bed?

128
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:55,935
Oh, God, full of compassion,
thou who dwellest on high.

129
00:10:56,436 --> 00:11:00,231
Grant perfect rest unto
the soul of Yale Goodman...

130
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:02,775
...who has departed from this world.

131
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:06,071
Lord of mercy, bring him
into Thy presence...

132
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:11,285
...and let his soul be bound up
in the bond of eternal life.

133
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:13,787
Amen.

134
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,708
I can't try to console you...

135
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,586
...by saying there is
any justice in this world.

136
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:22,213
Just be thankful for the friendship...

137
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:26,594
...and tenderness you and Yale
had the opportunity to share.

138
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:33,142
My philosophy of life has gotten me
through some very rough times.

139
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,519
Let me share it with you.

140
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:40,066
Que será será.

141
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,195
I got it from the song.

142
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:56,084
Judith?

143
00:11:58,128 --> 00:11:59,797
Just one thing.

144
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:02,216
If you can remember...

145
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:06,386
...what were Yale's last words?

146
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,017
"I'm coming."

147
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:15,313
I know you don't want to hear this...

148
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:19,735
...but you got to get
right back into circulation.

149
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,781
When you fall off the horse,
you got to climb right back on.

150
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:26,409
Aunt Kissy, please!

151
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,330
Could I be alone now?

152
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:32,499
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:40,341
She wants to be alone.

154
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,677
She wants to be alone.

155
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:46,597
She doesn't want to live in their place.
I can't blame her.

156
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:51,311
- Sell everything and buy her new.
- Buy her new? She'll live with us.

157
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:55,107
- What if she doesn't want to?
- She doesn't know what she wants.

158
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,736
And what's she going to do now?
Be my secretary again?

159
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:03,658
The girl's 29 years old
and trained to do nothing.

160
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,827
I'm 28.

161
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,469
Look what we got!

162
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,591
I've never not belonged to somebody.

163
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:57,926
Never.

164
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:01,222
My first boyfriend was
in nursery school. I was two...

165
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,349
...and he was three and since then...

166
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:07,853
...I've been pinned,
lavaliered, engaged...

167
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,314
...married twice.

168
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,985
The first time, I was twenty.

169
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:18,198
See, I've been in this room
eight days...

170
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:23,204
...and it's really the first eight days
I've ever been alone in my life.

171
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:25,748
If I'm not going to be married...

172
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,544
...I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with myself.

173
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:34,049
Did you happen to see
that movie Unmarried Woman?

174
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,428
Well, I didn't get it.

175
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:40,347
I would've been
Mrs. Alan Bates so fast...

176
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:43,017
...that guy wouldn't have
known what hit him.

177
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:45,812
The thing is, and then I'll shut up...

178
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:51,359
...I haven't done anything wrong.

179
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:54,738
And I feel like I'm being punished!

180
00:14:57,158 --> 00:15:00,035
I thought I'd be
filling up my freezer...

181
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:05,000
...and be getting this new
pine sideboard that I ordered and...

182
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:15,136
Jessica, I do hate...

183
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:18,473
...to stop your free association,
but our switchboard's flooded.

184
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,685
So set your phone down
and turn your radio up, okay?

185
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,605
Hello, Night Owl,
you're on the air.

186
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:28,817
You lucked out. I read in
the Enquirer this morning...

187
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,652
...that marriage causes cancer.

188
00:15:30,903 --> 00:15:33,198
Philadelphia Night Owl,
you're on the air.

189
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:36,743
About that Palestinian homeland.
In your Bible you'll see...

190
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:39,788
...that the Arabs had first dibs
on the West Bank.

191
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:41,206
Not tonight, Del, thanks.

192
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:43,626
Line 4, have you
got advice for Jessica?

193
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,961
Yes, I do. Hi, Jessica.

194
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:47,254
My name is Jim.

195
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:49,715
First let me say
how terribly sorry I am...

196
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,051
...about your misfortune.

197
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:56,181
And nobody knows better than you
that things can't get much worse.

198
00:15:56,848 --> 00:16:00,435
It's also pretty obvious that
you need guidance, security...

199
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:04,649
...good friends and a healthy dose
of self-confidence, Jessica.

200
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:10,029
What I'm saying is,
I think I can help you find a new life.

201
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:35,683
- Are you Jessica?
- Jim?

202
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,184
Yeah, hi.

203
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:39,603
Am I late or you early?

204
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,856
I'm just a few hours early.

205
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:43,357
Come on.

206
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:50,740
I should tell you,
my name is really Judy.

207
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:54,453
I just didn't want anybody I knew
to hear me on the radio.

208
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:57,123
- Macht nichts.
- What?

209
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,209
It means,
"It makes no difference" in German.

210
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,837
I was stationed over there
for 26 months.

211
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,631
UNITED STATES ARMY
RECRUITING STATION

212
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,218
What does that look like to you?

213
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:10,137
What? Club Med?

214
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:13,974
It's the Fort Ord Army
Base in Monterey, California.

215
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,561
Those look like condos.

216
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:21,649
And every soldier gets
his or her own private room.

217
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:23,485
What are these, yachts?

218
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,615
The Army is the best-kept secret
in the world, Judy.

219
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:30,826
Looks great, but you don't know me.

220
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,037
I'm not the Army type.

221
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,831
Forget that old brown boot
image of the Army.

222
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:40,462
It's the 80s Army, all the ladies love
it. All 89,000 of them.

223
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:43,256
Check out this list of jobs.

224
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:47,970
There's over 300 jobs, and only
a couple of them not offered to ladies.

225
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,431
Trained killers, stuff like that.

226
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:54,185
- How much do you earn per month now?
- Now?

227
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:56,145
Nothing.

228
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:57,689
Nothing?

229
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:03,403
Thanks.

230
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,490
What are you thinking?

231
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:11,621
I'm thinking about...

232
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:15,333
...my family...

233
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,752
...and my house...

234
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:22,133
...and all the gifts I have to return.

235
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:30,100
You shouldn't be saddled with a lot of
responsibilities and decisions now.

236
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:35,480
I'm prepared to offer you $458 a month,
train you in the job of your choice...

237
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:38,776
...pay for your food, your housing,
all your medical...

238
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:42,738
...and give you a 30-day paid vacation.
I'll tell you something...

239
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,949
...with your education and background...

240
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:47,827
...you could easily land an assignment
in Europe.

241
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:49,413
Europe?

242
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,666
I do need to get away.

243
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,545
I promise, you'll be in the best
physical shape you've ever been in.

244
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,258
It will be like 3 years at La Costa.

245
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,178
La Costa. That's good!

246
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,225
What if I hate it once I get there?

247
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:10,519
Quit.

248
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:12,897
It's a job, like anything else.

249
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:22,365
I...

250
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:23,950
State your full name.

251
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:27,537
Do solemnly swear or affirm...

252
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:31,042
...I will support and defend...

253
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,879
...the Constitution
of the United States...

254
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:39,759
...from all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

255
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:44,097
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance...

256
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:46,600
...to the same...

257
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:49,853
...and will obey the orders...

258
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,733
...of the President
of the United States...

259
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,987
...and the orders of
the officers over me...

260
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,118
...according to regulations.

261
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,419
All right.

262
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,382
My name is Sergeant L.C. Ross.

263
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:19,719
And I'll be your drill sergeant
for your 6 weeks basic training.

264
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,057
My job is to turn you
lovely ladies and gentlemen...

265
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,393
...into United States soldiers.

266
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:29,480
The first thing we'll do is put you
through your in-processing.

267
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,528
While you are waiting in line for your
processing, you will not, I repeat...

268
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:38,282
...you will not be flapping your lips.

269
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,285
You'll be filling out these forms.

270
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:46,416
I'm going to call out your names
and I want you to line up behind me.

271
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:51,045
Abbott.

272
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:52,423
Barnett.

273
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:55,176
Benjamin.

274
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,553
Benjamin!

275
00:20:57,803 --> 00:20:59,054
- Sir.
- Fall in, Benjamin.

276
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:00,473
I'm Private Winter...

277
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:04,603
...but I think I can be of assistance
in locating Private Benjamin.

278
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:06,480
Sir.

279
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:20,453
- Are we at the fort?
- Yes we are.

280
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:22,830
Time to wake up now.

281
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,167
In a sec.

282
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,294
Get your ass up
and out on the company street!

283
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:33,425
I never!

284
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:35,887
Give me 10 pushups!
Knock them out!

285
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:38,264
You mind if I check into
my room first?

286
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:40,725
Assume the position and hit it!

287
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:42,143
Now!

288
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,282
Up! Down!

289
00:21:58,995 --> 00:22:00,622
What is this, hell week?

290
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:01,915
No, Benjamin...

291
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:04,084
...this is the Army!

292
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:16,223
Excuse me, sir, is green
the only color these come in?

293
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,061
Close it up back there,
you meatheads. Go!

294
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:23,772
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Close it up!

295
00:22:24,022 --> 00:22:27,193
Close up that field back there!
Come on, move it!

296
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:30,947
Where are the yachts?

297
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:41,917
- Excuse me, are you a reporter?
- Who, me?

298
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:43,544
No.

299
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:47,841
I joined up, but I'm not staying.
There's been a mistake.

300
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:50,177
I'll straighten it out
when the manager gets here.

301
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:53,513
Man on the floor! In front
of your cots at attention!

302
00:22:58,436 --> 00:23:00,771
Barracks ready for inspection, Captain.

303
00:23:11,742 --> 00:23:15,370
What's the matter, honey?
Are you a crybaby?

304
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:16,498
No, sir.

305
00:23:16,748 --> 00:23:17,790
Ma'am!

306
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:24,756
I know how all you ladies
drool over this...

307
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,593
...this Fonzie character...

308
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,261
...but not in my outfit.

309
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:30,429
Burn it.

310
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,278
- Your name, soldier?
- Private Winter, ma'am.

311
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:00,504
Outstanding, Winter. Outstanding.

312
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:02,339
Ladies!

313
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:04,466
Examine Private Winter's locker.

314
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:05,884
Learn from it.

315
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:11,391
You keep this up and we'll talk
officer's candidate school.

316
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,768
Thank you, ma'am!

317
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:27,908
This brassiere isn't regulation, Ross.

318
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,036
And neither is this face.

319
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:33,415
And you look like a clown, soldier.
Clean up your act.

320
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:40,089
Gianelli's a 308, ma'am.

321
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:46,596
So it was the Army or jail?

322
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,018
After 6 weeks with me,
you're going to wish you chose Attica.

323
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:53,353
Don't push me, punk.

324
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:58,567
This is the most pathetic group
of trainees I have ever laid my eyes on.

325
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:02,489
My companies are the best-trained...

326
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:05,700
...the best-disciplined
soldiers on this base.

327
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:13,042
I hate to interrupt you,
but could I speak to you for a sec?

328
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:16,837
My Lord! Sergeant,
would you look at this!

329
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:18,923
I've seen it, ma'am.

330
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,427
What's your name, Princess?

331
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:23,762
Judy.

332
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:27,349
Judy Benjamin.

333
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:32,939
I think they sent me to the wrong...

334
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:35,066
...place.

335
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:40,571
You see, I did join the Army,
but I joined a different Army.

336
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:45,410
I joined the one with the condos
and the private rooms.

337
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:51,876
No, really! My recruiter,
Jim Ballard, told me that...

338
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:56,089
I don't care what your lousy recruiter
told you, Benjamin.

339
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:58,508
I'm telling you, there is no other Army.

340
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,593
Wait a minute.

341
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:03,347
I don't want to have to
go to your boss, okay?

342
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:10,688
To be truthful with you, I can't
sleep in a room with 20 strangers.

343
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:12,023
Oh, dear!

344
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:15,068
Look at this place.
The Army couldn't afford drapes?

345
00:26:15,318 --> 00:26:18,029
I'll be up at the crack of dawn here.

346
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:23,077
And I have to tell you,
I am frankly a little shocked.

347
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:25,329
You're shocked?

348
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:26,622
Why?

349
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:29,917
This place is a sty.

350
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:35,883
Look at these stains.
God knows where this has been.

351
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,595
And have you seen the bathroom?

352
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:48,521
Do you think that
the latrine is unsanitary?

353
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,732
It's disgusting!

354
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:54,445
There are urinals in there.

355
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:58,240
That's because this is the Army...

356
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:01,452
...it's not a sorority house.

357
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,168
May I see your toothbrush?
Please?

358
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,443
Yale, how could you do this to me?

359
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:54,134
You could eat off that floor.

360
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:56,137
Why don't you.

361
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,862
Reveille! Let's go!

362
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:12,780
Everybody up!

363
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,282
Move it!

364
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:16,827
Everybody up! Everybody move!

365
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:19,663
Everybody, Benjamin!

366
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:23,333
You can't mean me.
I worked the night shift.

367
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,045
Go check out the bathroom,
it's fabulous.

368
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:42,730
Alpha Company...

369
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,690
...attention!

370
00:28:44,982 --> 00:28:47,944
Bravo Company, attention!

371
00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:05,213
At ease, gentlemen...

372
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,632
...and ladies.

373
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:11,220
I'm your post commander.

374
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:13,597
Colonel Clay Thornbush.

375
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:14,932
Welcome...

376
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:18,394
...to the Biloxi, Mississippi
Basic Training Center.

377
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:20,522
The backbone of the U.S. Army.

378
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:23,900
You have two company commanders
to lead you through basic.

379
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,069
Capt. Doreen Lewis,
a 5-year veteran...

380
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,364
...here at Fort Biloxi,
of Alpha Company.

381
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:30,157
And a newcomer to the family...

382
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:33,160
...Captain William Wooldridge,
Bravo Company.

383
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,247
Here, we turn out
the best-fed, best-trained...

384
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:38,834
...soldiers, but it doesn't come easy.

385
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:42,504
It does not happen overnight.
You must have the strength...

386
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:46,716
...the self-discipline,
and mental stamina necessary...

387
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:49,887
...to meet the standards
of the United States Army.

388
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,223
The next 6 weeks will be the test.

389
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,433
It'll be hell...

390
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,230
...but you'll be glad you did it.

391
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,693
Move it!

392
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,071
Left, right! Left!

393
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,044
I thought it would be
a few leg lifts, a little stretching...

394
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:21,672
...maybe a disco class, you know.

395
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:24,633
You're not real talkative,
are you, Soyer?

396
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,635
We run them out...

397
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:28,554
...and we march them back.

398
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:33,977
Then about twice a week,
I spring a surprise inspection on them.

399
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,896
That's good Army.

400
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:38,982
Keeps them on their toes.

401
00:30:40,818 --> 00:30:43,321
- Got one more question.
- Shoot.

402
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:45,907
Are you busy Friday?

403
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:19,050
Look out, Gianelli!

404
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:30,062
I can't take anymore.
They've broken me.

405
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:32,900
- I'm quitting.
- Girl, you can't quit this Army.

406
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,403
I can. The recruiter told me
quit anytime I want.

407
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:39,364
Jesus, you still believe
your recruiter?

408
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:41,491
It's only for 3 years.

409
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,953
Company halt!

410
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:50,919
Move it, Benjamin!

411
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,216
I don't want to see you stop running
unless you collapse, faint or puke!

412
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:10,941
I have never looked
worse in my life!

413
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,987
Has anybody ever died from basic?

414
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:51,151
Excuse me.

415
00:33:59,452 --> 00:34:01,663
I think you took my blanket.

416
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:05,668
This is my blanket.
You gave it to me.

417
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,840
- I don't think I did.
- Maybe you just forgot.

418
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,884
Maybe you got brain damage.

419
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,681
Okay, I gave it to you.

420
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,433
By mistake.

421
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,519
- I want it back, okay?
- Take it.

422
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,495
Where are you going?

423
00:35:18,206 --> 00:35:19,541
Home.

424
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:29,969
We're going to have to
do this again real soon.

425
00:35:31,178 --> 00:35:33,264
How about every Friday night?

426
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,894
I'm going to set you free, Doreen.

427
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:03,964
Captain Lewis, ma'am,
we've got trouble.

428
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:09,554
My hair!

429
00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:21,191
Benjamin, you are not fit
to wear that uniform!

430
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:23,110
No shit!

431
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:30,410
What do you want from me?
I didn't ask her to punish everybody!

432
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,371
You think I like schlepping
in rain all day and night?

433
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:35,749
Just keep marching, Benjamin!

434
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:39,127
My name is Judy! J-U-D-Y...

435
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:42,006
...and I'd like somebody
to call me by my name.

436
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:44,008
Hey, Judy!

437
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:47,970
I took my life in my own hands.
I made a mistake.

438
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:51,600
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again!
I want to wear my sandals!

439
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:55,395
I want to go out to lunch.

440
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,522
I want to be normal again.

441
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:00,693
Would you please
just shut up, Benjamin!

442
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:04,405
God! Never in all my born days
met such a whiny...

443
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,616
...candy-ass as you!

444
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:10,161
I don't want to be in the Army!

445
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,086
But we do, okay?

446
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,755
We can't afford any more trouble
on account of you.

447
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:23,927
I thought you and I
could be friends, but you're...

448
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:26,972
- Forget it!
- What? I'm what?

449
00:37:27,764 --> 00:37:31,018
You're the most
insensitive person I've ever met.

450
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:33,354
That is so untrue!

451
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:37,692
I never go to someone's
home empty-handed!

452
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,902
People love me!

453
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:41,153
Platoon, halt!

454
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:43,782
Fall out!

455
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:52,875
To the day room...

456
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:54,294
...on the double!

457
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:14,941
They didn't tell me it was you.

458
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,245
Hi, Mom.

459
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:36,423
Hi, Daddy.

460
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:45,016
Sit down, Judy.

461
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:48,102
I was...

462
00:38:48,353 --> 00:38:51,689
...going to call, but I wasn't
feeling very good.

463
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,695
Eight days.

464
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:59,782
Our daughter disappears...

465
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:02,785
...for eight days without a single word.

466
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:08,875
We thought you were kidnapped.
The FBI was looking for you...

467
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:11,169
...when some stranger calls...

468
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:15,424
...telling us how fine you are
and that you'd enlisted in the Army.

469
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:18,719
We tried to figure out why.

470
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:22,890
Personally, I think you've gone
temporarily insane.

471
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:25,727
That's what we told everyone.

472
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:28,772
We said that you had a collapse...

473
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:31,066
...and that you were in a mental home.

474
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,027
People think I'm in a mental home?

475
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:36,197
What should we say?

476
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:40,285
That you're in an Army barracks
in Mississippi with a bunch of...

477
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:42,912
- What?
- I don't know what!

478
00:39:44,622 --> 00:39:46,458
That's why I don't like it.

479
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,922
How could you do this to your parents?

480
00:39:52,464 --> 00:39:57,012
Haven't we done enough for you?
Given you everything you wanted?

481
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:01,766
Did I get you a car on your sixteenth
birthday? Did I get you into college?

482
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:05,521
Did I bail you out of your first
marriage to that schmuck? Did I?

483
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:06,647
Relax.

484
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:08,691
I am relaxed!

485
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:16,116
Why are you punishing us?

486
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:22,915
Maybe you hate us.

487
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,503
I don't hate you,
I love you.

488
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:32,508
You know your Aunt Kissy
is living with us now.

489
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:34,677
Why?

490
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:37,723
Because you mother's had a
nervous breakdown, that's why!

491
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:47,108
You were never a smart girl.
We're all going to stop pretending now.

492
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:53,949
You are obviously incapable
of making your own decisions.

493
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:58,329
Starting tomorrow,
I do not let you out of my sight.

494
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:00,039
I don't care how much you cry.

495
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,541
The Benjamins!

496
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,127
Captain Lewis.

497
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,885
It is so good to meet you in person.

498
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:13,512
Thank you.

499
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,475
Captain Lewis said we could
take you home, darling.

500
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:22,355
I'm sorry that things just
didn't work out here for Judy.

501
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,483
She's a hard worker.

502
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,987
She's very... popular...

503
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:30,531
...with all the other girls.

504
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,701
We are sad to see her go.

505
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:40,333
If you sign here on the dotted line,
you're as good as home, young lady.

506
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,752
Right there.

507
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,591
Here, darling. Here you are.

508
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:51,596
Come on, take it.

509
00:41:54,432 --> 00:41:55,975
No, thanks.

510
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:59,104
Think I'll stay.

511
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:13,119
Mom.

512
00:42:13,786 --> 00:42:14,662
Daddy.

513
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:13,769
All right, knock it off!

514
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:15,521
Break it! Let's go!

515
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,017
Welcome to the Biloxi War Games,
the Super Bowl of Basic Training.

516
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:53,229
Simulated combat will test
your skills and courage.

517
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:56,899
Captain Wooldridge will lead
the red team. Captain Lewis...

518
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:01,029
...the blue team. I will be observing
the exercises from the air.

519
00:44:01,904 --> 00:44:03,991
Good luck.
And fight proud!

520
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:07,369
Fight proud!

521
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:19,257
Thompson, Hike...

522
00:44:19,507 --> 00:44:21,551
...Katz, Byron...

523
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:22,845
...Richter!

524
00:44:23,596 --> 00:44:27,725
Your objective is to capture and blow
up Red Team's communication center.

525
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:29,936
Beware, mine-fields are out there.

526
00:44:30,186 --> 00:44:31,938
Most of them are inert...

527
00:44:32,188 --> 00:44:33,440
...but some are ert.

528
00:44:33,982 --> 00:44:35,317
Take off!

529
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:36,693
Private Winter!

530
00:44:39,404 --> 00:44:41,782
You'll serve as Captain Lewis'
aide-de-camp.

531
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:44,827
Sir. Yes, sir!

532
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:46,788
Team "C"!

533
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,290
Gianelli, Glass...

534
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,542
...Moe, Benjamin...

535
00:44:51,793 --> 00:44:52,961
...Soyer!

536
00:44:54,004 --> 00:44:56,966
Your objective is to
guard this area here.

537
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:59,677
Excuse me, Drill Sergeant,
what is that area?

538
00:45:00,803 --> 00:45:02,221
That's the swamp.

539
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:03,806
Swamp?

540
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:07,894
Take off!

541
00:45:24,453 --> 00:45:27,624
If you can't read that map,
why don't you just say it?

542
00:45:27,874 --> 00:45:30,085
You're supposed
to be the point man!

543
00:45:30,335 --> 00:45:32,337
Benj pointed me in the wrong direction!

544
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:36,092
- What am I, Magellan?
- What are we going to guard, algae?

545
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,887
Let's just go straight north.

546
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:42,265
- We came from the north!
- Let's go south.

547
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:43,933
Wait! Relax.

548
00:45:44,183 --> 00:45:46,145
If we can't get back by tomorrow...

549
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,022
...they'll send a search plane.

550
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:50,524
We have enough bodies
to spell "help"?

551
00:45:51,025 --> 00:45:51,984
Let's go.

552
00:45:58,908 --> 00:46:01,870
The first time I ever did it...

553
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:13,215
...was on an overnight hike
with my Bible class.

554
00:46:15,635 --> 00:46:19,890
We're talking Laemil Lefebvre,
my preacher's son.

555
00:46:25,687 --> 00:46:30,151
I'd never done nothing
in my life before. Nothing!

556
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:32,987
And he just climbed right smack-dab...

557
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:36,032
...in the middle of my sleeping bag,
and I was scared.

558
00:46:38,035 --> 00:46:41,246
Not to mention the fact
that his daddy, the preacher...

559
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:44,166
...was right over there,
just about ten feet away.

560
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,292
How was it?

561
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:47,921
Quiet...

562
00:46:48,463 --> 00:46:51,466
...but very nice. Very nice!

563
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:57,013
I had an orgasm once.

564
00:46:59,976 --> 00:47:01,769
But I was alone.

565
00:47:04,146 --> 00:47:07,149
I guess you must have been alone.

566
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:16,076
Once...

567
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:21,374
...when I was with my first husband,
I got to this place...

568
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:24,627
...that was kind of nice and tingly.

569
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:32,136
I don't know if it was official.

570
00:47:32,386 --> 00:47:35,222
I mean, I don't know
if this was an official...

571
00:47:35,472 --> 00:47:37,474
...orgasm, you know.

572
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:44,149
But I counted it as one for five years.

573
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:49,238
How many times
have you been married?

574
00:47:52,325 --> 00:47:53,701
Twice.

575
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,207
The first time for six weeks...

576
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:01,293
...and the second time...

577
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:02,919
...for six hours.

578
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,046
Six hours?

579
00:48:04,796 --> 00:48:07,090
My husband had a heart attack and died.

580
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:08,300
What?!

581
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:12,805
My husband had a heart attack...

582
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,225
...and died on our wedding night.

583
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,939
While we were making love.

584
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,650
Holy shit!

585
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,860
Jesus, Benjamin!

586
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,947
I don't get it. What do you do
after a thing like that?

587
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,037
Join the Army.

588
00:48:56,228 --> 00:49:00,190
We're lost. We've passed
that same alligator 7 times.

589
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,235
I bet the war games are over by now.

590
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:05,655
- Lewis is going to just kill us!
- There's a plane!

591
00:49:05,905 --> 00:49:08,491
I bet that's headed back to base.
Let's follow it.

592
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:11,287
I hope it's not Delta to Miami.

593
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:15,082
Look, it's the Red Army headquarters.

594
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:19,295
Quiet!

595
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,594
Great.

596
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,473
- You owe me $6.95.
- You got it!

597
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:46,241
Hey, blood, how you doing?
All right, looking good!

598
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:49,202
- What's happening, girl?
- What can I tell you?

599
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,290
You're my prisoner of war,
that's what's happening!

600
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,377
- I ain't your nothing. Get that...
- I mean what I say!

601
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:01,132
Drop it!

602
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:05,346
No, you drop it.

603
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:08,515
I said, drop it!

604
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:14,356
- Where's Captain Wooldridge?
- In the tent interrogating a P.O.W.

605
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:16,650
Get the keys to the truck.

606
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:18,360
Come on.

607
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:23,449
- Oh, shit!
- Don't worry.

608
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:25,868
- I'll hot-wire it.
- You know how?

609
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:27,954
That's my former career.

610
00:50:28,204 --> 00:50:29,330
Excellent!

611
00:50:47,058 --> 00:50:48,267
What?

612
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:51,604
Freeze!

613
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:54,358
Private Winter!

614
00:50:56,485 --> 00:50:58,028
Well, lookee here!

615
00:50:58,278 --> 00:51:01,907
- Look what we got.
- Listen, Captain Lewis...

616
00:51:02,616 --> 00:51:04,995
She sent me out to find you guys and...

617
00:51:06,288 --> 00:51:07,580
...I got captured.

618
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:11,501
He promised me he'd put in
a good word with Captain Lewis.

619
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:13,420
And I really don't like him.

620
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,923
Take the prisoners.

621
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:20,219
Attention all Red Team personnel.

622
00:51:20,469 --> 00:51:23,597
The Blue Team has surrendered.
The Red Team has won.

623
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:25,392
So follow us.

624
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,520
Attention all Red Team personnel.

625
00:51:28,937 --> 00:51:30,522
The Blue Team has surrendered.

626
00:51:30,772 --> 00:51:33,317
The Red Team has won, so follow us.

627
00:51:39,073 --> 00:51:41,075
Red Team captured!

628
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,245
Ross, take the platoon...

629
00:51:45,413 --> 00:51:46,540
...head due west.

630
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:51,754
I'll lead the remaining troops
to the east.

631
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:00,930
What now?

632
00:52:01,348 --> 00:52:02,557
Got any ideas?

633
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:11,651
Off your asses!
On your feet!

634
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:19,076
Overwhelming enemy forces approaching.

635
00:52:19,785 --> 00:52:24,498
Blue Team Company Commander
requests permission to surrender, sir.

636
00:52:24,957 --> 00:52:27,001
Do you accept
surrender of Blue Team?

637
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:30,672
No, sir. We do not, because
we are also the Blue Team, sir.

638
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:32,465
Identify yourself, soldier!

639
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:35,134
Sir, Private Benjamin, sir!

640
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,985
At ease!

641
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:52,153
Which one of you is Private Benjamin?

642
00:52:52,404 --> 00:52:53,571
Sir, I am, sir.

643
00:52:55,448 --> 00:52:57,660
- Outstanding!
- Thank you, sir!

644
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,955
Here's the rest of the squad.
Privates Glass, Gianelli...

645
00:53:01,205 --> 00:53:03,541
...Private Moe and Private Soyer, sir.

646
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:06,877
Where is the Red Team Commander?

647
00:53:38,203 --> 00:53:40,999
Captain Lewis, you are lucky
to have troopers like this!

648
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:42,667
Congratulations!

649
00:53:43,126 --> 00:53:46,212
Next time don't be so quick
to raise the white flag.

650
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:49,383
- Yes, sir.
- The war games are concluded.

651
00:53:49,634 --> 00:53:52,887
Troops are dismissed.
I will see you tomorrow at graduation.

652
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,980
- Yes, sir!
- Can I offer your team a lift?

653
00:54:18,706 --> 00:54:23,087
Meet two of our Thornbirds!
Lieutenant Gomez and Sergeant Gates.

654
00:54:25,881 --> 00:54:28,801
Fabulous uniforms!
What's a Thornbird, sir?

655
00:54:29,051 --> 00:54:33,640
An elite airborne corp. We recruit
them from the best bases in the country.

656
00:54:34,265 --> 00:54:37,018
I'm damn proud of them,
like I'm proud of you girls.

657
00:54:37,268 --> 00:54:39,396
It's a hell of a job you did today!

658
00:54:40,773 --> 00:54:42,233
Where do you hail from?

659
00:54:43,442 --> 00:54:45,152
Philadelphia, sir.

660
00:54:46,529 --> 00:54:50,533
It's the seat of our democracy!
Thornie Two is from Philadelphia.

661
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:51,994
Thornie Two, sir?

662
00:54:52,411 --> 00:54:53,662
My wife.

663
00:54:54,496 --> 00:54:57,666
After 20 years watching us crazy guys
jump out of airplanes...

664
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,836
...she decided she wanted to try it.
Remember, Ed?

665
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:04,090
We took her up,
almost had to shove her out!

666
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:06,676
She had a good time,
but she landed wrong.

667
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:10,888
Broke her arm in 3 places. Lucky
we didn't have to shoot her, right?

668
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,642
We're approaching, sir.

669
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:16,478
I'll take her down.
You trust me, don't you?

670
00:55:16,729 --> 00:55:17,813
Oh, yes, sir!

671
00:55:18,188 --> 00:55:20,858
Then let's do it to it!

672
00:55:21,483 --> 00:55:25,655
- Tell your men to hang on, Benjamin!
- Hang on, men.

673
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,775
Whoop-de-do!

674
00:56:39,403 --> 00:56:42,489
Inspection, ladies!

675
00:56:55,963 --> 00:56:57,673
Lady Luck!

676
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:05,390
Don't you look at me
with those baby blues.

677
00:57:07,267 --> 00:57:09,936
I'm not the great Thornie.

678
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:17,570
You finally succeeded in making
a fool out of me, didn't you?

679
00:57:19,322 --> 00:57:20,740
Ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

680
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:24,827
I've got a reward for you,
my little hero.

681
00:57:26,121 --> 00:57:29,791
You're all going to scour
every inch of this rat's nest!

682
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:32,461
Inside and out.

683
00:57:34,504 --> 00:57:37,675
I mean the bed frames,
the window ledges...

684
00:57:37,925 --> 00:57:40,011
...the linoleum...

685
00:57:41,888 --> 00:57:43,598
...the toilet seats.

686
00:57:45,767 --> 00:57:47,436
You understand me?

687
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:49,980
Ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

688
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:52,107
I can't hear you.

689
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,655
I can't hear you!

690
00:58:05,497 --> 00:58:06,707
Thank you.

691
00:58:10,628 --> 00:58:13,547
It breaks my little old heart...

692
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:16,092
...to have to bust up
our winning team...

693
00:58:16,342 --> 00:58:19,346
...but I have been assigned
to a new post.

694
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,264
A good post!

695
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:25,519
Let's not keep in touch, shall we!

696
00:59:07,815 --> 00:59:10,360
Busted up, the whole team.

697
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,112
Busted up.

698
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:16,241
I have been assigned to a new post.

699
00:59:23,249 --> 00:59:24,417
Come on.

700
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:04,753
Good post!

701
01:00:36,037 --> 01:00:37,497
That was nice.

702
01:00:38,707 --> 01:00:40,918
Keep in touch, shall we?

703
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:03,926
At ease!

704
01:02:08,097 --> 01:02:09,890
Didn't think you'd make it, did you?

705
01:02:12,184 --> 01:02:15,105
You will no longer
be known as trainees.

706
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:19,984
You have earned the right
to call yourselves...

707
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:23,488
...United States soldiers,
and I'm proud of each of you.

708
01:02:26,158 --> 01:02:27,868
On Monday you will receive...

709
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,122
...your advanced individual
training assignments.

710
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:32,873
Each of you...

711
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:40,966
...will be given...

712
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:44,136
...a special responsibility
which will play...

713
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:47,473
...a key role in the
defense of the free world.

714
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,059
My heartfelt congratulations
and best wishes.

715
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,188
I almost forgot.

716
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,986
Dismissed till 0800 Monday morning.
Have a good one!

717
01:03:27,642 --> 01:03:28,518
Evening, ladies.

718
01:03:28,769 --> 01:03:30,312
We're not interested.

719
01:03:30,562 --> 01:03:32,397
Sorry.

720
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:35,734
All right, I'm uptight, okay?

721
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:39,405
Get yourself a drink,
we're going to cruise.

722
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:11,524
Judy Benjamin, this is Johnny Rourke.

723
01:04:11,774 --> 01:04:14,151
And Kim... I forget your last name.

724
01:04:14,402 --> 01:04:15,528
Osaka.

725
01:04:16,904 --> 01:04:19,658
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

726
01:04:22,703 --> 01:04:24,955
What's happening, Judy?

727
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:28,960
Bourbon, no ice.

728
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:33,381
I'm with Olivetti of Tokyo.

729
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:36,092
Johnny is my southeastern
U.S. Sales manager.

730
01:04:36,342 --> 01:04:39,138
He always shows me a hip time.

731
01:04:43,308 --> 01:04:44,977
What time is it?

732
01:04:47,396 --> 01:04:49,357
I just took your picture, mama!

733
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:53,570
Very hip.

734
01:04:53,987 --> 01:04:56,781
Look, I've got to go back to the base.

735
01:04:57,032 --> 01:04:59,493
Where's the fire? Come on.

736
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:02,955
This could be a big night for you.

737
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,250
Sincerely.

738
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:10,172
Liz?

739
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:12,090
- How are you?
- God, I'm fine.

740
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,634
I can't believe this!

741
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:19,140
Listen, thanks,
but I don't need the loan.

742
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,100
What are you doing in New Orleans?

743
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,978
My dad's here on a medical
conference and we all came.

744
01:05:24,228 --> 01:05:25,855
Come and see them, they'll die!

745
01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:28,608
Wait a minute.
Who is that with your parents?

746
01:05:30,235 --> 01:05:34,156
A French gynecologist. He and Dad
spoke on the Lamaze panel together.

747
01:05:34,615 --> 01:05:36,658
- Isn't he totally gorgeous?
- Totally.

748
01:05:36,909 --> 01:05:39,203
If it weren't for Jeffrey,
I'd go for him myself.

749
01:05:39,454 --> 01:05:41,373
Look who I found!

750
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:45,168
My God, how are you, darling?

751
01:05:45,418 --> 01:05:49,297
Kid, you look wonderful!
Please give me a hug.

752
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:54,595
Sit down.

753
01:05:57,473 --> 01:05:59,850
- Henri Tremont.
- Benjamin, Judy.

754
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:02,854
Will you look at this?
GI Judy!

755
01:06:03,105 --> 01:06:05,065
We'll call your parents.

756
01:06:05,315 --> 01:06:07,275
They'll be so thrilled we saw you.

757
01:06:07,526 --> 01:06:10,028
Your mother's coming along very nicely.

758
01:06:10,321 --> 01:06:12,198
She gained back some of the weight.

759
01:06:13,741 --> 01:06:14,784
Champagne?

760
01:06:15,076 --> 01:06:16,369
I'd love some, thank you.

761
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:17,995
Since Yale's fu...

762
01:06:19,414 --> 01:06:23,210
By the way, I can't get over you
in this Army outfit.

763
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,171
She didn't swim because
she didn't want her hair wet.

764
01:06:26,422 --> 01:06:27,631
This is true.

765
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:29,258
What it's like to be a WAC?

766
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:32,137
- I'm not a WAC.
- How often do you talk to your folks?

767
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:35,140
Tell Henri how long
we've known your parents.

768
01:06:35,432 --> 01:06:38,059
Shall I make a long story short?

769
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:40,603
Leo and I and Judy's parents...

770
01:06:40,854 --> 01:06:45,067
...double-dated in Atlantic City,
before even any one of us was married.

771
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:48,571
It wasn't Atlantic City.
It was Asbury Park, but it's all right.

772
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:52,242
I've never been to
Asbury Park in my life.

773
01:06:55,162 --> 01:06:56,288
Would you like to dance?

774
01:06:56,788 --> 01:06:58,498
I'd love to dance.

775
01:07:12,389 --> 01:07:14,058
The Lemishes are terrific people...

776
01:07:14,308 --> 01:07:17,853
...but 4 hours of making long stories
short was driving me crazy.

777
01:07:18,103 --> 01:07:20,939
4 hours? Try 28 years.

778
01:07:24,903 --> 01:07:27,697
I've never danced with a soldier before.

779
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:30,825
I've never danced as a soldier before.

780
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:36,040
- I kind of like it.
- So do I.

781
01:07:41,754 --> 01:07:44,007
Do you have a boyfriend in this Army?

782
01:07:44,257 --> 01:07:45,509
No.

783
01:07:47,594 --> 01:07:49,554
Don't you get lonely?

784
01:07:50,597 --> 01:07:54,352
- How'd you get to speak English so well?
- Baltimore.

785
01:07:54,602 --> 01:07:57,647
- Maryland?
- I went to med school at Johns Hopkins.

786
01:08:16,418 --> 01:08:20,171
I just can't believe
that you're in this Army.

787
01:08:22,882 --> 01:08:25,302
If I knew you better,
I'd show you my dog tags.

788
01:08:27,012 --> 01:08:28,180
How much better?

789
01:08:48,453 --> 01:08:50,413
Let's go to my room.

790
01:08:55,586 --> 01:08:58,047
I'm really attracted to you.

791
01:08:59,048 --> 01:09:03,469
But I'm not ready to make love to a
man I just met an hour and a half ago.

792
01:09:04,344 --> 01:09:06,056
I'm sorry.

793
01:09:06,473 --> 01:09:08,600
That's just the way I am.

794
01:09:10,351 --> 01:09:14,981
Usually, by the time I kiss a guy, I
already know his mother's maiden name.

795
01:09:17,693 --> 01:09:19,445
I wish I knew you better.

796
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:21,781
I'm thirty-four...

797
01:09:22,073 --> 01:09:25,117
...and I live alone in Neuilly,
on the outskirts of Paris.

798
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,997
I'm the only child...

799
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,833
...and my father is also a doctor.

800
01:09:33,126 --> 01:09:34,419
What else?

801
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,132
When I'm not working I play soccer.

802
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,844
Let's see...

803
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,597
I'm Jewish.

804
01:10:08,165 --> 01:10:11,710
Now I know what I've been
faking all these years.

805
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,181
That was your first?

806
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:26,810
And second.

807
01:10:39,366 --> 01:10:40,909
Where are you going?

808
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,371
- Just to get a sip of champagne.
- I want to go with you.

809
01:10:59,346 --> 01:11:00,848
I'm sorry.

810
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:06,353
No I'm not.

811
01:11:09,691 --> 01:11:11,109
What?

812
01:11:12,527 --> 01:11:14,237
Private Benjamin.

813
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,702
Meeting you tonight was...

814
01:11:22,955 --> 01:11:25,208
It was just what I needed.

815
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,387
What you needed?

816
01:11:45,605 --> 01:11:47,357
If you're ever in Paris...

817
01:11:48,525 --> 01:11:50,319
If you're ever in Biloxi.

818
01:11:55,032 --> 01:11:56,784
It was nice meeting you.

819
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,766
What did you get?

820
01:12:19,016 --> 01:12:22,980
- MP School.
- You can put your violence to good use.

821
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:25,524
- Smoke and flame specialist.
- What's that?

822
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:26,734
A fireman.

823
01:12:26,984 --> 01:12:29,570
I got transferred to
Fort Ord, California.

824
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,615
You got the yachts, honey!
You got the yachts!

825
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,410
- What?
- OCS.

826
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,328
Can you believe it?!

827
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:42,376
- Honey, you're going to be an officer.
- There goes a beautiful friendship.

828
01:12:42,626 --> 01:12:43,544
What did you get?

829
01:12:43,836 --> 01:12:46,130
I don't know. I'm petrified.

830
01:12:46,505 --> 01:12:48,007
Excuse me!

831
01:12:48,382 --> 01:12:50,301
- Where's Benjamin?
- Right there.

832
01:12:51,302 --> 01:12:52,304
Thornbirds?

833
01:12:53,263 --> 01:12:54,514
Me?

834
01:12:55,015 --> 01:12:56,683
They don't have women Thornbirds.

835
01:12:56,933 --> 01:12:58,351
They do now.

836
01:13:03,566 --> 01:13:07,361
I was a skinny fighting lad
No more than seventeen

837
01:13:07,612 --> 01:13:11,699
The sorriest excuse for a man
That you have ever seen

838
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:15,621
But now I am a Thornbird
And as proud as I can be

839
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:19,917
Colonel Thornbush
Made a man out of me

840
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:28,802
Glory, glory
I'll be falling through the sky

841
01:13:29,052 --> 01:13:32,931
Glory, glory
I am not afraid to die

842
01:13:33,182 --> 01:13:36,644
Glory, glory
I'm as proud as I can be

843
01:13:36,894 --> 01:13:40,981
Colonel Thornbush
Made a man out of me

844
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:37,419
Good morning, sir.

845
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:39,254
I'd like you to meet my wife.

846
01:14:40,172 --> 01:14:44,009
- Good to meet you, Mrs. Thornbush.
- Good to meet you, Miss Lady Thornbird.

847
01:14:44,259 --> 01:14:47,180
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

848
01:14:47,513 --> 01:14:49,474
I guess this is the Thorndog.

849
01:14:49,807 --> 01:14:51,058
Shake, Scrabble!

850
01:14:53,144 --> 01:14:56,607
You must be nervous
about the big jump tomorrow.

851
01:14:56,857 --> 01:14:59,359
The Colonel says I can do it.
I guess I can.

852
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:02,196
The Colonel's motto is,
"Life is a series...

853
01:15:02,446 --> 01:15:05,950
...of challenges to be
met and mastered."

854
01:15:06,242 --> 01:15:10,371
I hope you catch a cloud, Benjamin.
Not a feeling like it in the world.

855
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:14,542
You're in a veil of white,
not a sound except your beating heart.

856
01:15:15,376 --> 01:15:17,004
It's godlike.

857
01:15:22,259 --> 01:15:25,346
You must be very special.

858
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,808
The "Big T" is a
great judge of character.

859
01:15:28,058 --> 01:15:29,935
Stop gabbing and let this soldier...

860
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:31,186
...get some chow.

861
01:15:31,436 --> 01:15:32,854
Goodbye, sir.

862
01:15:35,357 --> 01:15:38,486
I really appreciate
your confidence in me.

863
01:15:38,736 --> 01:15:40,613
I'm not going to let you down.

864
01:15:41,906 --> 01:15:44,617
See you at 13,000 feet, okay?

865
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:53,961
Oy vey!

866
01:16:05,849 --> 01:16:07,852
Go with it!
Soar! You're a Thornbird!

867
01:16:10,104 --> 01:16:12,398
Come on, Benjamin,
let's go! All right?

868
01:16:17,696 --> 01:16:19,823
- You can do it! Trust me!
- I can't!

869
01:16:20,991 --> 01:16:23,201
I'm ashamed, but I'm afraid to die.

870
01:16:23,452 --> 01:16:26,746
- I'm afraid, Colonel. I'm not brave.
- Take it easy!

871
01:16:26,997 --> 01:16:28,291
I can't. I'm afraid...

872
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,376
...my chute won't open.

873
01:16:30,626 --> 01:16:33,129
- Calm down, Benjamin!
- What if I fall upside down?

874
01:16:33,379 --> 01:16:36,716
- I could vomit in midair!
- Take it easy!

875
01:16:36,966 --> 01:16:40,888
I tried to be macho, but those guys
are better at being men than I am!

876
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,182
Relax, Benjamin,
you don't have to jump!

877
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,434
- I don't?
- No!

878
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,853
Take it easy, girl! Shape up!

879
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:49,939
You better?

880
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,233
I feel better now.

881
01:16:52,484 --> 01:16:55,111
You don't have to jump.

882
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:57,489
You're a good man.

883
01:16:57,781 --> 01:16:59,408
There are other ways you can serve.

884
01:17:05,915 --> 01:17:06,874
Happy, darling?

885
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,669
- You want it!
- What are you doing?

886
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,422
I can smell fear in any man
and passion in any woman!

887
01:17:12,672 --> 01:17:13,715
You want it!

888
01:17:15,634 --> 01:17:18,428
My God, this isn't happening to me!

889
01:17:19,597 --> 01:17:20,807
I'm going to take you.

890
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,851
I'm not in the mood.
Suddenly I feel nauseous.

891
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:25,770
Come to papa.

892
01:17:26,521 --> 01:17:29,649
I don't think so, sir,
but thanks anyway.

893
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:35,989
My God! Open, please!

894
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:45,834
At ease.

895
01:17:48,586 --> 01:17:50,506
I'm glad you're back in one piece.

896
01:17:52,049 --> 01:17:56,470
I apologize for yesterday's indiscretion.
An unforgivable breach of discipline.

897
01:17:57,179 --> 01:17:58,764
And taste, sir.

898
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,187
I hope it hasn't soured you
on the military.

899
01:18:04,563 --> 01:18:07,315
The question is how long
you'll continue as a Thornbird.

900
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:09,526
Hopefully not too long, sir.

901
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:12,864
Understood.

902
01:18:13,114 --> 01:18:16,993
That's why I've put you on special
assignment, transferred to another post.

903
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:20,455
A special assignment
on the ground, I hope.

904
01:18:21,331 --> 01:18:23,292
- A job in procurement.
- Procurement?

905
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:26,628
That's purchasing. I've cut
your orders, you leave at 1500.

906
01:18:28,755 --> 01:18:29,882
Greenland?

907
01:18:30,132 --> 01:18:32,093
What, penguins? Forget it!

908
01:18:32,844 --> 01:18:33,970
Forget it!

909
01:18:35,138 --> 01:18:38,183
I was in the first wave of the Rangers
at Normandy on D-day.

910
01:18:38,433 --> 01:18:42,938
In 1952 I was standing with my troops
on the banks of the Yalu River, waiting.

911
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:45,483
MacArthur phoned.
"Come home, Thornie...

912
01:18:45,816 --> 01:18:48,110
...it's not our year."
I am a good leader.

913
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,362
No, I am a great leader!

914
01:18:50,821 --> 01:18:53,200
Your ass is going to
Greenland for a reason.

915
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:58,163
I won't let you shoot your mouth off,
blemishing my record with innuendo.

916
01:18:58,497 --> 01:19:00,248
Innuendo? Try rape.

917
01:19:03,252 --> 01:19:04,128
How about Guam?

918
01:19:05,171 --> 01:19:06,631
My hair will frizz.

919
01:19:07,965 --> 01:19:08,841
Okinawa?

920
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:12,303
Malaria? Pass.

921
01:19:12,971 --> 01:19:15,349
We have bases all over the world.

922
01:19:46,466 --> 01:19:49,177
Dear Glass, hello from Belgium.

923
01:19:49,427 --> 01:19:53,140
Sorry it's taken me so long to write,
but I've been very busy.

924
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:55,226
S.H.A.P.E. Is an amazing place.

925
01:19:55,518 --> 01:19:58,354
The top military headquarters
in Europe.

926
01:19:58,604 --> 01:20:01,649
Definitely the most exciting duty
a soldier could pull.

927
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:04,278
My M. O. S. Is Purchasing Specialist...

928
01:20:04,528 --> 01:20:07,364
...the one job I've
trained for all my life.

929
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:09,950
My superior is a terrific guy...

930
01:20:10,742 --> 01:20:13,537
...a Turkish officer
named Lieutenant Rahmi.

931
01:20:13,787 --> 01:20:17,917
But the best one can say of his English
is that it's better than my Turkish.

932
01:20:18,877 --> 01:20:20,503
Benyameen, ka'.

933
01:20:21,838 --> 01:20:22,964
Sate.

934
01:20:24,424 --> 01:20:28,471
Benyameen, I need the inpoormation
on the drying caruses.

935
01:20:28,888 --> 01:20:29,889
Driving courses?

936
01:20:30,139 --> 01:20:32,349
Yes, sir. I'm working on that now.

937
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,521
Excellent. I want you
to rye-eed it to the counsule.

938
01:20:37,355 --> 01:20:39,274
Me? Read it to the council?

939
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:41,777
Do want me to rye-eed it?

940
01:20:45,573 --> 01:20:47,617
Private Benyameen... Benjamin!

941
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:51,037
I got a charming apartment
through an ad in Stars and Stripes.

942
01:20:51,287 --> 01:20:54,749
It's right over a bakery,
has a hot plate, running water...

943
01:20:54,999 --> 01:20:56,960
...and all the croissants I can eat.

944
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:59,963
It's not exactly Versailles,
but it's home.

945
01:21:00,214 --> 01:21:04,343
For the first time in months, I feel
that things are really going my way.

946
01:21:19,944 --> 01:21:22,780
I finally got the nerve
to pay Henri a surprise visit.

947
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:26,910
I'll let you know how it turns out.
I hope he remembers me.

948
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:31,540
My love to Moe and Gianelli.
Votre amie, Private B.

949
01:21:32,165 --> 01:21:35,335
Let's see... just got into town.

950
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:40,800
And feeling kind of lonely.
No, don't say lonely.

951
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:42,260
Oh, God!

952
01:22:08,706 --> 01:22:12,501
It's a great house, but don't be
impressed. It's a hand-me-down.

953
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:33,274
- Morning.
- Nine o'clock?

954
01:22:33,524 --> 01:22:36,319
I haven't slept this late in 3 months.

955
01:22:41,867 --> 01:22:44,119
- Where are you going?
- Sunday soccer.

956
01:22:45,412 --> 01:22:46,789
Merde! I'm late.

957
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,958
I have to go anyway.

958
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,960
Don't be ridiculous, please!

959
01:22:51,211 --> 01:22:54,547
Stay. I want you to be here when
I get back at three o'clock.

960
01:22:54,798 --> 01:22:59,261
I'm going to make love to you,
and I'll take you to my favorite bistro.

961
01:23:00,054 --> 01:23:02,723
And we'll listen to
some nice Italian jazz.

962
01:23:04,099 --> 01:23:05,017
Max!

963
01:23:15,445 --> 01:23:17,531
Hello, baby!

964
01:23:19,867 --> 01:23:21,536
He's beautiful.

965
01:23:21,786 --> 01:23:22,829
Sit!

966
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:29,502
The dog is deaf.

967
01:23:36,093 --> 01:23:38,387
Wait for me, please.

968
01:23:43,434 --> 01:23:45,478
I could get used to you.

969
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:11,047
I paid 8,000 francs for this rug.

970
01:24:12,091 --> 01:24:16,471
I'm sorry. He gets nervous
around new people.

971
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:18,556
He's not the only one.

972
01:24:22,978 --> 01:24:26,064
- I have to clean this up.
- You go play. I'll clean up.

973
01:24:26,315 --> 01:24:28,817
No, I'll clean it.
Go play.

974
01:24:40,955 --> 01:24:42,249
I adore you.

975
01:24:49,757 --> 01:24:54,513
There are two bids we recommend:
Sergio Devoto's Driving Academy...

976
01:24:54,846 --> 01:24:57,557
...which teaches evasive driving
to the chauffeurs...

977
01:24:57,808 --> 01:25:01,144
...of such dignitaries as
General Alexander Haig...

978
01:25:01,394 --> 01:25:05,107
...President Giscard d'Estaing,
Mick Jagger...

979
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:07,735
Excuse me, Private Benjamin...

980
01:25:07,985 --> 01:25:11,113
...I'm afraid I missed
the security data on these drivers.

981
01:25:11,364 --> 01:25:13,951
The security data was
unavailable to me, sir.

982
01:25:14,618 --> 01:25:17,079
Who's here from security?

983
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:19,790
I am, sir.

984
01:25:23,586 --> 01:25:26,256
That material is highly classified, sir.

985
01:25:26,506 --> 01:25:29,968
I am certain this soldier
is not cleared for that level.

986
01:25:30,218 --> 01:25:32,303
Then clear her, Captain.

987
01:25:33,973 --> 01:25:34,932
Is there a problem?

988
01:25:38,102 --> 01:25:39,019
No, sir.

989
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:42,439
Then we'll expect a revised report
by the next council session.

990
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:43,732
Gentlemen...

991
01:25:44,067 --> 01:25:45,110
...chow time.

992
01:25:49,573 --> 01:25:50,615
Good job.

993
01:26:10,471 --> 01:26:12,264
Behave yourself, Judy Benjamin...

994
01:26:12,514 --> 01:26:17,187
...or I'll drum your ass out of S.H.A.P.E.
So fast it'll make your head spin.

995
01:26:24,694 --> 01:26:26,322
Sorry, Helga.

996
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:28,532
Who is your friend, Doreen?

997
01:26:28,782 --> 01:26:31,118
She's no fwiend... friend.

998
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:34,121
Listen, the bags are packed.

999
01:26:39,419 --> 01:26:41,546
My ex-girlfriend, Claire, painted it.

1000
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:45,592
- What's it supposed to be, death?
- No, it's a self-portrait.

1001
01:26:46,469 --> 01:26:48,554
How long ago did you and this...

1002
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:51,224
...painter break up?

1003
01:26:52,016 --> 01:26:56,271
- 14 weeks ago, Monday.
- You're still counting it in weeks?

1004
01:26:58,106 --> 01:27:02,027
How come you broke up?
Or is that too personal?

1005
01:27:03,737 --> 01:27:05,364
Claire is a brilliant woman.

1006
01:27:05,614 --> 01:27:09,953
I even joined the Communist Party
for her for a week.

1007
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:14,415
Not romantic though,
much too independent.

1008
01:27:18,254 --> 01:27:20,464
Do you know a lot of tortured artists?

1009
01:27:21,048 --> 01:27:23,342
Only tortured lawyers.

1010
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,097
Your first husband was a lawyer?

1011
01:27:27,347 --> 01:27:30,767
No, Rick was a tennis pro
at the El San Juan.

1012
01:27:31,268 --> 01:27:35,105
My therapist said that I had
a neurotic need to find a father figure.

1013
01:27:35,355 --> 01:27:39,277
And he had a neurotic need to find
a father-in-law who had a lot of money.

1014
01:27:48,912 --> 01:27:53,792
You know, I've been married to men
I haven't felt this comfortable with.

1015
01:29:07,498 --> 01:29:11,044
What's the story with you
and this Tremont character?

1016
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,713
Why are you spying on me?

1017
01:29:26,978 --> 01:29:30,732
- Your lover-boy's a Red!
- Don't be ridiculous!

1018
01:29:30,983 --> 01:29:33,944
He was a Red for about five seconds.

1019
01:29:34,194 --> 01:29:36,071
Because of a woman he used to date.

1020
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:40,576
Nobody stops being a Communist.
It's a terminal disease.

1021
01:29:40,827 --> 01:29:44,622
And I am not going to sit around
with my thumb up my ass...

1022
01:29:44,873 --> 01:29:47,375
...while you divulge
classified information...

1023
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:49,878
...during the throes of passion.

1024
01:29:50,128 --> 01:29:53,382
Please! I can barely speak
during the throes of passion.

1025
01:29:53,799 --> 01:29:57,136
Believe me, Henri Tremont is
as much a Communist as me.

1026
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:58,637
Or you!

1027
01:30:00,222 --> 01:30:03,518
If Patton were alive,
he would slap your face.

1028
01:30:06,897 --> 01:30:08,148
As you were.

1029
01:30:12,737 --> 01:30:14,113
Captain Lewis.

1030
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,911
Private Benjamin has made herself
vulnerable to a Red, sir.

1031
01:30:20,161 --> 01:30:21,370
I read the report.

1032
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:22,623
It's not true, sir.

1033
01:30:22,873 --> 01:30:27,336
We're not blind to the fact
that half of Europe is Communistic.

1034
01:30:28,504 --> 01:30:30,839
But here at S.H.A.P.E.
They're still the enemy.

1035
01:30:31,548 --> 01:30:33,176
General Foley, Henri Tremont...

1036
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:36,846
...is not a Communist.
He's a gynecologist.

1037
01:30:37,889 --> 01:30:40,225
Captain Lewis is hung up
on a technicality.

1038
01:30:40,558 --> 01:30:44,855
I'm sorry, but it's against regulations
for you to associate with this man.

1039
01:30:45,856 --> 01:30:48,234
You're up for a promotion.

1040
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:51,779
I'd hate to see this incident
jeopardize your career.

1041
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:55,033
What are you trying to tell me, sir?

1042
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,370
It's either him...

1043
01:30:58,662 --> 01:30:59,704
...or us.

1044
01:31:25,024 --> 01:31:27,151
- Can't you hear?
- Can't you move?

1045
01:31:33,658 --> 01:31:35,119
It's Judy.

1046
01:31:35,369 --> 01:31:36,370
Judy who?

1047
01:31:37,246 --> 01:31:39,582
Darling, how are you?

1048
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:41,792
What?

1049
01:31:48,341 --> 01:31:49,968
She's getting married.

1050
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:09,448
Monsieur Shiffman!
Thank God!

1051
01:32:14,912 --> 01:32:17,498
Listen, the tablecloths...

1052
01:32:21,878 --> 01:32:25,925
...they're terrible.
The color, la couleur, is all wrong.

1053
01:32:29,345 --> 01:32:32,556
The wedding is in yellow...

1054
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:35,434
...and butterscotch.

1055
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:39,523
And right now I'm looking at
something entre...

1056
01:32:39,773 --> 01:32:42,484
...canari et banane.

1057
01:32:42,901 --> 01:32:43,818
Gabby!

1058
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:47,448
Pardon, Madame!

1059
01:32:48,533 --> 01:32:51,077
I get the Hoover.

1060
01:32:56,249 --> 01:32:58,961
Was she a good maid
before she met me?

1061
01:33:01,004 --> 01:33:04,049
Is it smart to fire the maid
just before the wedding?

1062
01:33:04,508 --> 01:33:06,636
Especially with your parents coming.

1063
01:33:07,011 --> 01:33:10,515
Okay, she stays until after the wedding.

1064
01:33:12,892 --> 01:33:14,936
You look very beautiful today.

1065
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:17,398
So do you.

1066
01:33:18,148 --> 01:33:20,401
What did your friends say
when they called?

1067
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:23,487
They're coming over on
Army Transport next week.

1068
01:33:23,737 --> 01:33:26,657
I can't wait to see them.
It's going to be so much fun.

1069
01:33:26,907 --> 01:33:29,286
And Glass is learning French!

1070
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,464
Honey, who was that?

1071
01:33:42,133 --> 01:33:44,051
It was Claire.

1072
01:33:47,763 --> 01:33:49,057
Claire?

1073
01:34:01,738 --> 01:34:03,865
Get over this obsession with Claire.

1074
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:06,326
You stood with your tongue hanging out.

1075
01:34:06,659 --> 01:34:08,454
I was surprised to see her.

1076
01:34:08,704 --> 01:34:11,916
Surprised?
I'd call it catatonic.

1077
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:15,920
You don't see me getting hung up on your
old boyfriends and husbands.

1078
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:17,588
Do you?

1079
01:34:19,424 --> 01:34:20,884
Listen to me.

1080
01:34:21,176 --> 01:34:22,260
Come here.

1081
01:34:24,554 --> 01:34:25,472
I love you.

1082
01:34:26,097 --> 01:34:28,183
We're getting married in a week.

1083
01:34:35,983 --> 01:34:37,652
I want to have a baby with you.

1084
01:34:40,405 --> 01:34:41,532
You do?

1085
01:34:43,242 --> 01:34:44,993
Oh, honey!

1086
01:34:46,245 --> 01:34:47,871
I'd love to have a baby.

1087
01:34:49,373 --> 01:34:51,084
I thought I was getting too old.

1088
01:34:55,255 --> 01:34:56,965
A baby!

1089
01:35:00,386 --> 01:35:03,389
- I want us to be together always.
- We will!

1090
01:35:09,937 --> 01:35:11,982
It's the reality of things sometimes...

1091
01:35:12,232 --> 01:35:16,111
...they don't always work out
exactly as they are planned, so...

1092
01:35:17,404 --> 01:35:18,989
What are you saying?

1093
01:35:21,909 --> 01:35:24,078
- I want you to sign this.
- What is it?

1094
01:35:24,328 --> 01:35:26,289
Contrat de mariage.

1095
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:30,042
A letter of financial agreement.

1096
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:35,173
God forbid something should happen
to us. It just helps us stay friends.

1097
01:35:36,925 --> 01:35:39,386
I want to be your wife, not your friend.

1098
01:35:39,678 --> 01:35:43,641
It's fair. I allocated for myself
what was mine before our marriage.

1099
01:35:44,225 --> 01:35:46,394
You cannot expect me to give you...

1100
01:35:46,644 --> 01:35:50,648
...half of a house that's been
in my family for centuries.

1101
01:35:54,528 --> 01:35:57,948
We don't need this kind of thing
between us. We'll make it.

1102
01:35:58,908 --> 01:36:00,868
I can't get married without it.

1103
01:36:10,921 --> 01:36:12,840
It's in French.

1104
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:14,550
Please.

1105
01:36:33,196 --> 01:36:35,365
Private Benjamin?

1106
01:36:35,615 --> 01:36:38,076
Did I write that? I'm sorry.

1107
01:36:38,326 --> 01:36:39,994
I'll just cross it out.

1108
01:36:45,251 --> 01:36:46,961
Initial it.

1109
01:37:01,268 --> 01:37:03,729
Where shall we go tonight?
Regine's?

1110
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:22,708
Took Henri's car to the shop.
Made Henri's hair appointment.

1111
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:24,836
Took Max to the vet.

1112
01:37:25,086 --> 01:37:27,547
Picked up Henri's soccer uniform.

1113
01:37:34,346 --> 01:37:37,725
You've got to remember that
I used to be a very active person.

1114
01:37:37,975 --> 01:37:40,227
I was jumping out of airplanes...

1115
01:37:40,477 --> 01:37:43,564
...and at S.H.A.P.E. It was
like nonstop chaos.

1116
01:37:43,814 --> 01:37:46,192
You're not thinking about
opening a store?

1117
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:48,361
No, you were right about that.

1118
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:52,157
It would've been too much
of a hassle to do. It was a bad idea.

1119
01:37:52,407 --> 01:37:56,120
But there have to be other choices.

1120
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,789
Do you know what I did today?

1121
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,084
I rearranged my closet.

1122
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:03,753
For three hours.

1123
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:07,299
There's definitely something wrong
with that, isn't there?

1124
01:38:09,343 --> 01:38:11,803
- Am I making sense?
- No.

1125
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:14,556
And that's what I love about you.

1126
01:38:17,894 --> 01:38:20,355
This is the color of hair
I was talking about.

1127
01:38:22,023 --> 01:38:24,108
I don't know. Maybe.

1128
01:38:26,153 --> 01:38:27,529
I love it.

1129
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:57,479
Rita Hayworth, I swear to God!

1130
01:38:57,729 --> 01:39:00,774
- I wouldn't have recognized you.
- You look stunning!

1131
01:39:01,024 --> 01:39:04,444
Turn around, let me see the outfit.
Oh God, doll! Gorgeous!

1132
01:39:04,695 --> 01:39:06,196
It's an absolute vision.

1133
01:39:06,446 --> 01:39:08,575
Her hair is the worst!

1134
01:39:08,825 --> 01:39:13,037
To see you looking like your
old self again, you have no idea!

1135
01:39:13,288 --> 01:39:15,164
Who knows what we'd do
in her place.

1136
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:19,169
The important thing is,
Judy's Judy again.

1137
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:24,008
- Truthfully, you don't miss the Army?
- What's to miss? $400 a month?

1138
01:39:24,258 --> 01:39:27,261
The only good thing about it
was that what's-her-name.

1139
01:39:27,511 --> 01:39:28,889
Captain Lewis?

1140
01:39:29,472 --> 01:39:32,767
I hope her coat's good enough.
I had no idea it'd be so chilly.

1141
01:39:33,018 --> 01:39:37,857
- It's November here, Kissy.
- It's November everywhere, genius!

1142
01:39:46,741 --> 01:39:47,950
Sit!

1143
01:39:49,578 --> 01:39:51,830
I was talking to Max.

1144
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:56,418
It's good to see you up.

1145
01:39:57,711 --> 01:39:59,923
Excuse me for interrupting.

1146
01:40:01,007 --> 01:40:02,675
Does this belong to anyone?

1147
01:40:02,926 --> 01:40:05,678
Because I'm positive it isn't mine.

1148
01:40:05,929 --> 01:40:07,764
Oui, Madame.
Where did you find it?

1149
01:40:08,014 --> 01:40:09,600
Where you left eet!

1150
01:40:09,934 --> 01:40:12,770
May I ask what you were doing
in my bed?!

1151
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,731
I was not in your bed, madame.
I make your bed.

1152
01:40:17,316 --> 01:40:18,859
It must have fallen.

1153
01:40:19,986 --> 01:40:20,946
What are you doing?

1154
01:40:21,196 --> 01:40:24,115
I would like to know how
this item got into my bed.

1155
01:40:28,578 --> 01:40:32,250
This is too much!
Judy, give Gabrielle back the cross.

1156
01:40:39,382 --> 01:40:41,885
What should I think?
She's the world's worst maid!

1157
01:40:42,135 --> 01:40:43,804
Enough! Please!

1158
01:40:47,516 --> 01:40:51,938
What's gotten into you lately? It's like
I live with the kid from the Exorcist!

1159
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:55,608
Two weeks ago I was like a god to you!

1160
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,527
Now you show me no respect.

1161
01:40:58,236 --> 01:40:59,779
I respect you.

1162
01:41:00,113 --> 01:41:04,618
Accusing me of sleeping with Gabrielle!
You think I'm so low I'd seduce a child?

1163
01:41:07,454 --> 01:41:08,414
Do you?

1164
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:15,922
Honey, I'm nervous.

1165
01:41:16,673 --> 01:41:18,842
I'm very nervous.

1166
01:41:19,092 --> 01:41:23,347
And I know that once we get married
everything is going to be fine.

1167
01:41:23,598 --> 01:41:25,266
I'm sorry.

1168
01:41:34,568 --> 01:41:38,322
I fly 6,000 miles to attend
my daughter's wedding...

1169
01:41:38,572 --> 01:41:40,449
...and the groom is playing soccer!

1170
01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:43,953
Daddy, he'll be here any minute.
He probably went into overtime.

1171
01:41:44,287 --> 01:41:46,539
Monsieur, my son is very reliable.

1172
01:41:46,789 --> 01:41:49,667
- He will be here shortly.
- It just isn't right!

1173
01:41:54,924 --> 01:41:56,467
Jean-Paul!

1174
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:02,891
Where is Henri?

1175
01:42:03,558 --> 01:42:06,519
The bum never showed up
for the game. Isn't he here?

1176
01:42:07,687 --> 01:42:08,813
No.

1177
01:42:09,147 --> 01:42:10,232
He never showed up?

1178
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:17,073
Judy, don't hate me
for saying this or nothing...

1179
01:42:17,323 --> 01:42:21,661
...but you really might be better-off.

1180
01:42:21,911 --> 01:42:23,830
Don't be ridiculous!

1181
01:42:25,582 --> 01:42:30,254
I don't know how to say this, but you
were starting to act a bit weird again.

1182
01:42:30,504 --> 01:42:32,673
What am I going to do?
I'm a wreck.

1183
01:42:33,424 --> 01:42:34,801
He's back!

1184
01:42:39,681 --> 01:42:41,266
You look perfect.

1185
01:42:41,516 --> 01:42:43,142
- Where were you?
- I'm fine.

1186
01:42:43,394 --> 01:42:46,188
No, where were you?
I was so scared.

1187
01:42:46,438 --> 01:42:49,775
- You don't want to know this.
- I do want to know.

1188
01:42:52,403 --> 01:42:54,281
I had to see Claire.

1189
01:42:57,033 --> 01:42:58,034
You were with Claire?

1190
01:42:58,285 --> 01:43:02,038
She is in so much trouble.
You've no idea what I've been through.

1191
01:43:02,289 --> 01:43:06,210
There are 75 people waiting for you.
Couldn't you have phoned?

1192
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:10,089
- Don't bad French artists have phones?
- She was overwrought.

1193
01:43:10,423 --> 01:43:14,469
Her boyfriend beat her up.
I prescribed a sedative for her to sleep.

1194
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,264
That takes 2 minutes,
you were gone 4 hours.

1195
01:43:17,514 --> 01:43:20,142
The place was a mess.
I hung up clothes and did dishes.

1196
01:43:20,392 --> 01:43:22,603
You did Claire's dishes?

1197
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,275
Shall I stop being nice to people
because we're marrying?

1198
01:43:27,817 --> 01:43:31,112
I just don't understand
how you could be with Claire...

1199
01:43:31,571 --> 01:43:32,447
...today.

1200
01:43:32,697 --> 01:43:35,284
You want to walk down the aisle
with me or not?

1201
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,019
Not so fast.

1202
01:45:18,314 --> 01:45:22,234
I know this is a very
awkward time to do this...

1203
01:45:23,444 --> 01:45:24,778
...but I want to break up.

1204
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:26,822
She's crazy again.

1205
01:45:27,573 --> 01:45:28,783
Listen to me.

1206
01:45:29,075 --> 01:45:33,788
You're having an anxiety attack.
I'll give you a shot to calm down.

1207
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:37,167
No, I want to be perfectly conscious
when I call a cab.

1208
01:45:37,417 --> 01:45:40,963
What are you doing to me?
What is this about? Gabrielle?

1209
01:45:41,672 --> 01:45:44,383
I slept with her one night
when you were acting crazy.

1210
01:45:45,718 --> 01:45:48,179
We'll fire her after the wedding.

1211
01:45:51,725 --> 01:45:53,143
You're such a schmuck!

1212
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,396
Daddy...

1213
01:45:56,647 --> 01:45:58,900
...Mom just fainted.

1214
01:46:00,318 --> 01:46:01,694
Schmuck?!

1215
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:05,281
When I met you,
you were in the Army.

1216
01:46:05,657 --> 01:46:08,076
You were nothing,
picking up strangers in bars!

1217
01:46:08,326 --> 01:46:10,496
- Now just a minute!
- She was.

1218
01:46:10,996 --> 01:46:14,625
I'll give you a future, a home, a name.
For once don't be stupid!

1219
01:46:16,001 --> 01:46:17,419
- There's Claire.
- Where?

1220
01:46:24,511 --> 01:46:25,595
Don't call me stupid.
