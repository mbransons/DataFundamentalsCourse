1
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:19,850
- Good night, John.
- Good night, milord. Good night, milady.
- Good night.

2
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:31,526
Excuse me, sir. Is that
Lord Glenarvan's yacht?

3
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,226
- It is.
- Well, we'd like to see him, please.

4
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:37,168
Oh, would you, now?
He'll be horribly hurt to know...

5
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:39,501
you didn't arrive
for the start of the party.

6
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:41,564
We didn't even know about it.

7
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:44,667
I bring news of one of his ships,
disappeared at sea.

8
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:47,804
A message from Captain Grant
of the Britannia.

9
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:51,339
Captain Grant?
Why, he's dead, isn't he?

10
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:54,979
And just how would he get
a bottle where he's at?

11
00:02:55,055 --> 00:03:00,254
- Go on. Get on with you.
- Captain Grant's our father,
and he's not dead.

12
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,591
I'm Mary Grant,
and this is my brother, Robert.

13
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:06,359
Oh, no offense intended, miss.

14
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,698
He was a good man, he was.
The best this line ever had.

15
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,173
It's just that it's, uh, hard to take
serious. The note in the bottle, I mean.

16
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,608
Still, I-I suppose
it could happen.

17
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:21,169
And that's why we just have to
see his lordship before he sails.

18
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:23,876
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I've had my orders.

19
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,578
Nobody aboard
except invited guests.

20
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:30,885
But we've come all the way from Plymouth
today. It has cost me my last franc.

21
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,982
And we haven't
had a thing to eat.

22
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:38,698
So that's it.
Another trick, is it?

23
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:42,531
Get out of here with your wild tales,
your hard-luck stories.

24
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:47,062
You almost had me taken in for a minute.
Go on. Stand clear of the gate there.

25
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,700
Come on, Robert.

26
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:59,045
- Lovely.
- Good night to you.

27
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:01,883
You two, come back here!

28
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,321
Come back, I said.

29
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,383
You children,
come here at once.

30
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,452
- Did you hear me?
- Good evening.

31
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,397
- Come back, I said!
- Good evening.
- Come back at once!

32
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:27,643
Come out now, matey,
wherever you are.

33
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:30,683
You wouldn't want me to lose
my bloomin' job now, would you?

34
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:36,181
- How do we get past this one?
- Good night, sir.

35
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,520
Oh, very simple.
Just walk nonchalantly...

36
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,463
up the plank backwards.

37
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:48,467
Yes, with all the confusion...

38
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:51,993
he won't be able to tell you
from the departing guests.

39
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,939
Go on now. Go on.

40
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,679
Good night, sir, madam.

41
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,683
Good night, sir.

42
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,756
Good night, sir, madam.

43
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:24,297
- Come on.
- You now.

44
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:27,204
Go on. Go on, go on!

45
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,367
Good night, sir.

46
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,446
Good night.

47
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,746
Little boy, would you be so kind
as to get my wrap for me?

48
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,550
- I think I left it in the salon.
- You children, what are you
doing there?

49
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:48,686
- Stop those children!
- Evening.

50
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:52,061
- Come back, you two!
- Good evening. Good evening, sir.

51
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:56,728
Come back. Stop, you two!
Come on. Stop!

52
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,703
Come back, you two.
Come back!

53
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,543
- May I give you some more turkey?
- Thank you.

54
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:08,479
- Not too much.
- The salmon is delicious.

55
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:18,720
I hear Lord Glenarvan is going
to Venezuela again this year.

56
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,192
Yes. He so much
enjoys the seasons.

57
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,821
How long does he plan
to be away this time?

58
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:29,460
He seems very proud
of this new, uh, steamer.

59
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:34,197
Good evening.

60
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,279
Uh-Uh, cloves from Madagascar.

61
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:53,018
It is not bad for English ham.

62
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:15,412
Oh, excuse me, madam.

63
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,946
There's someone
under the table! Look!

64
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:34,586
There they are!
Head them off the other way.

65
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:41,161
Steward! Steward!
Up there on the deck!

66
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:51,274
- Oh, let me go!
- Why?

67
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,744
Come back, you two! Come back!

68
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,008
Oh, come here.
Come here now, then. I got you!

69
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,482
- I got you!
- Oh, let me go!

70
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,612
- You leave him alone!
- Oh!

71
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:06,887
Oh. It's you, your lordship.

72
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,895
- Isn't it?
- I dare say, but who are you?

73
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:13,091
- Oh, please, your lordship,
we must speak to you.
- We've come all the way from Plymouth.

74
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,533
- I'm Mary Grant, and this is my
brother. Our father's Captain Grant.
- On the Britannia.

75
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:19,470
- And he's alive. And you must send
a ship to bring them back.
- With two of his men.

76
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:22,702
- As quick as you can.
- Now, just a minute.

77
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,800
Come along.
We'll talk it over.

78
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,574
Now, then, how do you know
your father's still alive?

79
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,808
- He put a note in a bottle.
- And a French professor...

80
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,443
- Monsieur Paganel, he found it.
- Oh-Oh, that again.

81
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:34,713
- What do you mean?
- My dear children, ever since...

82
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,620
I posted the reward
for news of your father's ship...

83
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,148
people have been turning up with notes
they claim to have found in bottles.

84
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,627
- How many is this, John?
- Uh, 22, Father.

85
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:47,894
If I had my way,
every last one of the culprits
would be hanged from the yardarms!

86
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,128
Exploiting human misery,
that's what it is.

87
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,330
Nothing more vicious,
more treacherous.

88
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:54,635
But it is from my father.
I can tell.

89
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:57,801
Monsieur Paganel, show them
the note you found in the bottle.

90
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,916
Voilŕ. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
Wr-Wrong bottle.

91
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,751
Ah, this is the one.

92
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:14,816
First question always,
where'd you find the bottle?

93
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:17,488
Well, y-you see, milord,
I-I went fishing with some students.

94
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:20,123
And I suppose you cut open a fish
and found the bottle inside.

95
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:23,259
Oui, oui, milord,
a 220-pound shark!

96
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:26,305
Osborne, throw this man off the ship
before I turn him over to the police.

97
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:29,671
- No, your lordship.
- But it is the truth, what I tell you.

98
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:31,835
Ridiculous. Why should a shark
want to swallow a bottle?

99
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,778
Oh, what was in his mind,
I-I-I don't know.

100
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,873
I-I tell you only what
was in his stomach.

101
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,352
You make a career of this,
do you, exploiting children?

102
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:46,148
I am Jacques Eliacin
Francois Paganel.

103
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:50,559
Professor of geography,
Université of Paris.

104
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,723
My credentials, milord. Oh!

105
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,369
Forged, I imagine, like the note
in the bottle. All right, steward.

106
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,135
Come along.

107
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,238
- Oh, no, your lordship, you can't!
- Monsieur Paganel's our friend.

108
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:09,907
Just a minute, children.
I have something to say to you.

109
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:13,043
If we could be
alone for a moment.

110
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:18,022
Take your hands off me, messieurs.
Never have I been thrown
from anyplace in my life.

111
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:20,992
Let's not set a precedent.

112
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,599
My dear children, don't you think
I'd be the first to respond...

113
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,862
if I thought there was the slightest
chance of finding your father...

114
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:32,166
or any of his crew alive?

115
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:35,036
I'd go to the ends of the earth,
and that's no idle boast.

116
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:37,269
The Glenarvan motto:
''Persevero. ''

117
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,470
It's been the family creed
for 800 years.

118
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:44,244
But it's not a hoax. I saw the note
myself, and I know my father wrote it.

119
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,342
The way he makes his letters.
I can tell.

120
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:48,410
Just a little more clever
than the rest, that's all.

121
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:52,254
When you consider the odds, it would be
fantastic just finding the bottle.

122
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:55,385
But this business about it
being swallowed by a shark--

123
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:58,294
Well, what would my father have to do?
Come back here himself and say...

124
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:01,094
''Yes, I wrote the note.
Now come and find me.''

125
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,034
Did I understand you to say
you came all the way from Plymouth?

126
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:06,731
Tell Osborne to get cabins ready
for 'em. We'll drop them
off there on the way.

127
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:08,797
- Very well.
- But what about Monsieur Paganel?

128
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:13,107
- We can't go off here and leave him.
- Now, my dear, I'm only doing
what's best for you.

129
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,621
Now, then, how'd he get past you
in the first place?

130
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,817
Well, how did he get past you,
if it comes to that?

131
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:30,795
Now, wait a minute.
Oh, here's his lordship's wine.

132
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:34,264
- And about time too.
- A bit late, aren't you, Charlie?

133
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,769
It'll be a pretty rough trip
if his lordship doesn't get his wine.

134
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,411
Uh, follow me, please.

135
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:02,923
This way, miss. Cabin number five
on the starboard side.

136
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,513
Of course, Richard's
a lot older than you.

137
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:29,749
Maybe not actually in years, but--
Oh, he's been around more.

138
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:32,347
I don't know what
you mean by that.

139
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:35,087
After all, there's probably
nobody else in the world my age...

140
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:37,391
who's made as many trips
to the Mediterranean as I have.

141
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:40,660
Well, that's just it! I mean...

142
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:45,761
have you ever been to, oh,
South America, for instance?

143
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,432
As a matter of fact, no.

144
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:53,172
- Pacific Ocean. Ever seen that?
- It's only an ocean.

145
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:55,874
Perhaps you should have waited
and had breakfast with my father.

146
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:59,714
He's the one
who'd have to give the order
to change course for South America.

147
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,083
Oh, he would go.
Nothing could stop him...

148
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,385
if it were for something
you could really believe in...

149
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:07,085
and not this note in a bottle.

150
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:20,465
Let me ask you something. If you were
a castaway and you had a bottle...

151
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,906
wouldn't you put a note in it
and throw it into the sea?

152
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,435
Oh, I don't think so. After all,
it's such a small chance, isn't it?

153
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:33,110
Well, what would you do, then?
Just sit there with the empty bottle
until you died or something?

154
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:35,279
All right. I suppose I would try it.

155
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:38,414
But I wouldn't expect someone
to find it inside a shark.

156
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,789
Well, if that's where
they did find it...

157
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,991
you wouldn't expect them
to just forget about you, would you?

158
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:48,090
You never saw that Frenchman before
in your life...

159
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,260
did you, until he showed up
with the bottle.

160
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,497
And yet, you believe
every word he says.

161
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:57,976
And no matter what he says, you
and your father refuse to believe him.

162
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,979
Suppose I told you that I'd found
a bottle with a note in it.

163
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,447
- Would you believe me?
- Well, did you?

164
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:05,313
- Yes.
- And what did it say?

165
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,375
It said:

166
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:11,382
''Disregard first message.''

167
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:15,357
Oh, I suppose you think
that's funny, don't you?

168
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:18,522
You've got your father,
so to you this is just a big joke.

169
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,930
Now, wait a minute.
I'm not making a joke of it.

170
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,764
- I'm just trying to show you.
- Please, do you mind?

171
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,498
- I'll make you an offer.
- What kind of an offer?

172
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:30,872
I don't necessarily believe this story
about the shark swallowing the bottle.

173
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:34,902
But I am getting a little fed up
with these infernal trips
to the Mediterranean.

174
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,187
Down, boy. Good old boy. I'll bring
you a bone or something later.

175
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:44,450
That's a good boy.

176
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,790
Oh, uh, bonjour.

177
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:00,035
In case you've emptied
your own pockets.

178
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:04,008
And just don't let any shark
get this away from you.

179
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,636
Thank you.

180
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:10,944
I assure you, mademoiselle,
your case shall be properly presented.

181
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,422
After all, Father,
suppose it was you cast away.

182
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:23,826
Do you think I would give up
if I had even the slightest clue?

183
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:28,026
I'd live up to all the legends
of Glenarvan. Persevere,
if I had to move heaven and earth.

184
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,001
- Why don't we try Corsica for a change?
- Father, will you listen to me?

185
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,767
- Haven't been there for years.
- Suppose you were a castaway
and you had a bottle.

186
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,173
You wouldn't just sit there
staring at it until you died
or something, would you?

187
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:40,371
You'd at least try
putting a note into it.

188
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,006
And suppose for some strange reason
it did get swallowed by a shark.

189
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:46,279
- Most unlikely, I'd say.
- Very well, then.

190
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:50,618
If you won't listen, I shall be getting
off at Plymouth with Mary and Robert.

191
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,523
- Oh, come, come, come, come.
- I feel very strongly about this,
Father.

192
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,527
My dear boy,
if that's the way you feel about it,
let's have a look at the blasted note.

193
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,530
- Where is it?
- In the bottle.
- Well, where's the bottle?

194
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:03,295
- The Frenchman has it.
- Confound it, where's the Frenchman?

195
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:07,601
- You had him thrown off
the ship in Glasgow.
- That's a fine thing.

196
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:09,766
When I really want something,
no one takes the slightest notice.

197
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:12,208
- If I happen to drop a casual remark--
- Casual remark?

198
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,610
''Throw him off the ship
before I call the police!

199
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,705
We ought to hang him
from the yardarm.''

200
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:19,808
Now we're in a deuce of a fix.
That Frenchman might be anywhere by now.

201
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:23,787
Where's Captain Mangles?
Tell Captain Mangles to-- Oh!

202
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:26,825
- Oui, milord?
- Good gracious, the Frenchman!

203
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:30,726
- I thought--
- Oh, but I give you my word,
I was put off the ship.

204
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,492
Fortunately, I do not let
such things upset me.

205
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:36,126
The note, milord.

206
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:38,727
Well, this is useless. There's
practically nothing of it left.

207
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:42,501
Ah, but with a little study,
a little intelligence...

208
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:45,009
it is possible
to make out what is said.

209
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:47,477
You will see one thing
w-without question.

210
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:51,505
Their location is given
as 37 degrees...

211
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,610
11 minutes, southern latitude.

212
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,282
That's no good
without the longitude.

213
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:02,794
Consider first, milord,
on the 37th parallel...

214
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:07,322
there are only a few places
they could be.

215
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,858
That's what I've always said.
If Captain Grant's anywhere at all,
he's in Australia.

216
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:14,133
It's only logical, monsieur, if you know
anything about shipping and commerce.

217
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,333
Use the head, milord.

218
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,469
The note makes reference
to being captured, no?

219
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,708
And you can make out the word
''Indian'' or ''Indians.''

220
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:28,049
So where on the 37th parallel
would they be captured by Indians?

221
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,216
- Australia, of course!
- Aboriginals, yes. Indians, no.

222
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:38,496
By George! I've got it. South America.
Couldn't be anywhere else.

223
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:41,055
And if he was captured by Indians,
he'd be on the West Coast.

224
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,158
It's a matter
of simple logic, monsieur.

225
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:47,968
We'll go there and follow
the 37th parallel over the Andes...

226
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,031
until we find Captain Grant.

227
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,577
Osborne, find Captain Mangles!
Tell him I'm going to change course.

228
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,977
- Thank you, milord! Thank you!
- Oh!
- Now, just a minute.

229
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:57,379
Don't forget that
it was me who arranged--

230
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,078
- Thank you!
- Thank you, milord!
- Thank you, milord!

231
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:03,610
Oh, please!
I'm an Englishman, you know.

232
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:43,418
There, milord, is where we must go.
The pass of Antuco.

233
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:47,357
Then follow the parallel
until we find Captain Grant.

234
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:51,590
Ha, jolly good trick to throw
a bottle into the ocean
from up there, I must say.

235
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:55,259
Ah, but could he not put
the bottle into a river?

236
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:58,394
And would it not flow
down to the sea, eh?

237
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:04,506
No, no. Grimpons.

238
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:08,604
- Grimpons.
- That means ''let's climb.''

239
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,047
It is the French recipe
for the good life.

240
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:15,849
Whatever you want to do, don't be
afraid to do it for fear of failure.

241
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:21,120
Don't be afraid
of the beautiful and high mountain

242
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:26,130
- Let's climb, let's climb
let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
- Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb

243
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:31,397
Don't be afraid of
the beautiful and high mountain

244
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,634
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb

245
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,609
And if we fall, crash, bang

246
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:41,111
And die a terrible death

247
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,083
Never mind, we've had the joy
the joy of the climb

248
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:52,112
Oh, don't be afraid of
the beautiful and high mountain

249
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:56,059
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
let's climb, let's climb

250
00:21:57,296 --> 00:22:01,164
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
let's climb, let's climb

251
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:07,461
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb

252
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:22,244
Oh, look! Look!
Straight down that valley there.

253
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:26,348
- Where?
- Do you see it, milord?

254
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:29,326
A river into which
one might throw a bottle.

255
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:32,796
- By Jove, yes!
- And an Indian village.

256
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:35,959
I'd say, this could be just the place,
couldn't it? Have a look, my dear.

257
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:39,869
Better make camp here tonight
and get an early start in the morning.

258
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:44,937
Hey, you, make camp.
Stay here tonight.

259
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,377
- No stay.
- Huh?

260
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:53,045
- What's the fellow talking about?
- Ah, it is not Spanish.

261
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,882
It must be a local Indian term.

262
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:59,720
Hey, hey, hey.
What means trango peeray?

263
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:11,393
Oh, I-I-I-I-I think
he-he wants to tell us...

264
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,496
it gets, uh,
terribly cold up here.

265
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:17,133
Oh, we build a fire,
no matter how cold.

266
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:22,146
No matter how trango peeray,
we stay in hut.

267
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:25,012
- No stay.
- Listen to me.

268
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:27,746
I tell you when to go
and when to stay.

269
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,052
- No stay.
- We stay here tonight!

270
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:36,254
- You stay. We go.
- Don't you dare to try and tell me!

271
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:42,756
I think the fellow
really means it.

272
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:59,212
Well, that's done it.
Without the horses, we're helpless.

273
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:03,186
- We'll never make it.
- Well, can't we still go on on foot?

274
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:05,917
But of course, mademoiselle.
The Araucanians have...

275
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:09,119
crossed these mountains on foot
for hundreds of years.

276
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:11,424
- Even drive their sheep.
- Oh, good!

277
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:14,557
- When do we start?
- We're not gonna start.

278
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,931
I'm not gonna go
leaping about like a--

279
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:19,402
like a confounded
mountain sheep, thank you.

280
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:23,931
- Oh, please, your lordship, please!
- No, no, mademoiselle. Uh, he's right.

281
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:27,809
Uh-Uh-Uh, we-we'll, uh, return
to the ship with the Indians...

282
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,372
and get some crewmen
who are younger.

283
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,716
- Age has got nothing
whatever to do with it.
- I'll take over
and lead the-the expedition.

284
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:38,951
You-You-You can remain
in your deck chair.

285
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:43,654
You lead the way? Ridiculous! Have
the whole lot of you lost in no time.

286
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:47,563
On the other hand,
with me in command...

287
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:53,196
it would take a great deal more than,
ha, trango peeray to turn us back.

288
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,132
- That's right, isn't it?
- Right, your lordship.

289
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:12,812
Monsieur Paganel, do you think
we might have one tonight?

290
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:18,625
When you are in the poultry yard, it is
a good time to wish you catch the egg.

291
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:21,825
See? Look at this. See?

292
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,667
Any slight tremor of the earth,
and it starts to swing.

293
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:29,502
But if you're asleep,
how could you tell?

294
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:33,511
Oh, maybe all night I sleep,
uh, with one eye open.

295
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:38,777
Perhaps his lordship
will sleep better...

296
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:41,718
if we do not tell him
before tomorrow...

297
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:45,848
what trango peeray means, eh?

298
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:56,599
Your pleasure, mademoiselle.

299
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,008
Castaway, castaway

300
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:16,919
Trust in your star

301
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:21,653
You know I will find you

302
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:26,096
Wherever you are

303
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:29,861
Though all your dreams

304
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:34,702
May be tossed by the tide

305
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:38,334
Cling to your hopes

306
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:42,506
Never cast them aside

307
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:48,119
Castaway, castaway

308
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:52,122
Though you may be

309
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,593
Lost in the wilderness

310
00:26:56,662 --> 00:27:01,258
Over the sea

311
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,962
I will discover

312
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:09,371
Your castaway shore

313
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:11,739
Then you'll

314
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,110
Be a castaway

315
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,979
No more

316
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:21,076
You'll be

317
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:25,886
A castaway

318
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:30,054
No more

319
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,499
It's my father's favorite.

320
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:40,504
E-Ever since I was a little girl,
I've always thought it sad.

321
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,507
Not the way you sang it.

322
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:47,602
Oh, it's just the way I feel
tonight, I suppose.

323
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,012
Oh, it's all so exciting.

324
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,018
We're up here.

325
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:56,816
Father's down there.

326
00:27:56,888 --> 00:28:00,187
The stars pointing the way.

327
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:03,352
It's almost like
being in heaven.

328
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:06,090
- I know.
- Ah, there you are, my boy.

329
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:08,428
Better get some sleep, you know.
Got an early start.

330
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,025
- We're too excited to sleep.
- Mm, so I see.

331
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:13,037
You'd better come along with me,
just the same.

332
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:21,370
Wait. I want to make a wish
on that star.

333
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,937
What could you wish for
that you haven't got?

334
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:27,110
That my father would go
somewhere and get lost.

335
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:29,881
Just for a little while,
you understand.

336
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,019
- What on earth are you doing?
- This is to wake me up.

337
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:40,087
- Wake you up?
- Yes, in case--

338
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:44,499
- In case what?
- Oh, nothing.

339
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:48,403
- And what is this, may I ask?
- My watch, milord.

340
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:51,533
Perhaps I want to look at it
during the night.

341
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:55,513
How very peculiar.

342
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,048
Oh, Robert, really.
Do put those things away.

343
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:01,483
But if there's an earthquake,
I want to be sure and see it.

344
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,748
Earthquake? Who said anything
about an earthquake?

345
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:07,758
Oh, I'm so stupid, milord.

346
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:10,852
I didn't realize it until later.

347
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:15,696
The Indian, when he did,
uh-uh-uh, that, you see?

348
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,099
He did not mean
it was cold. No.

349
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,732
He meant trango peeray--
earthquake!

350
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:28,371
- This is the land of many earthquakes.
- Good gracious me.

351
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:31,541
In the whole world,
no place has such big...

352
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:36,576
such beautiful, such magnificent
earthquakes as right here.

353
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:41,786
But it is one chance in a million
we should be so fortunate.

354
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:46,764
Yes. Yes. Yes, of course.
Quite right.

355
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:49,926
Besides, this place looks as if
it's been here for hundreds of years.

356
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:53,562
Doesn't it?
I mean, uh, it's safe to assume...

357
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:56,129
that it will last
one more night, eh?

358
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:02,440
- Oui, monsieur?
- Oui, milord.

359
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:05,972
And I'll wake you up
if one comes, your lordship.

360
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:42,244
- It worked!
- Oh, Robert, do be quiet.

361
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,756
An earthquake
of the first magnitude.

362
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:50,789
I say, do you have
to shake the whole place?

363
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:54,195
By Jove, it's an earthquake!
Outside, everybody!

364
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:06,004
Oh! Oh, magnificent!

365
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:16,681
This is an experience that makes
our entire expedition worthwhile.

366
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:27,825
By Jove, that was
a narrow squeak! Oh!

367
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,819
I say, this is
getting rather dangerous.

368
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:57,225
Then we attempt to change course.
Everybody to port.

369
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:09,800
- It worked!
- That's better. Much obliged.

370
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,878
- Look out! Look out!
- This way, everybody, quick!

371
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:20,514
To the port, quick!

372
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:25,421
- What the-- Port, quickly!
- No, starboard!

373
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,651
- Port, I say!
- Starboard!

374
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:29,159
Where are we going now?

375
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:35,154
- Perfect timing.
- Oh!

376
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,932
- Abandon ship!
- No! Wait!

377
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:42,838
- There's a hole in the ice!
- But we don't know where it goes.

378
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:45,239
We'll soon find out.

379
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:50,772
Alpine-type glacier.
Drift minimum.

380
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:54,216
We'll never get
out of here alive.

381
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:57,619
The ice melts and gets out.
Why can't we?

382
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:17,168
- Isn't it beautiful!
- Oh!

383
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:21,645
They'll never believe us
when we get home. If we get home.

384
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:32,981
Look out, everybody! Duck!

385
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,419
Where--
Where're we going now? Ooh.

386
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,759
Try starboard, I tell you!

387
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:57,078
- This is most peculiar.
- Look out!

388
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,681
- That was close.
- Oh!

389
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,760
Mary!

390
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,170
Come on!

391
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,988
- Where's Robert?
- Here's his hat.

392
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:57,103
Robert! Robert,
can you hear me?

393
00:34:57,175 --> 00:35:01,009
Not down there.
I'm up here.

394
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,244
Oh, a giant condor.
A Sarcohamphus gryphus.

395
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:09,184
Robert, hold on!

396
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:13,418
I don't have to.
She won't let go.

397
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:17,757
This is true. She will not let go
until she reaches her nest.

398
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:21,993
- Reaches her nest?
- Yes, high in the mountains.

399
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,762
No doubt she has
little ones that must--

400
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:31,574
Hang on, Robert.
We're coming!

401
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:48,287
- Robert!
- I got dizzy coming down...

402
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,987
but it was a jolly good view
from up there.

403
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:54,190
- Oh, thank goodness you're all right.
- I wonder who fired the shot.

404
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:57,132
Perhaps he did.

405
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,167
A Patagonian. Magnificent!

406
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,869
It's like turning back
the history book hundreds of years.

407
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:08,640
Hope he's not dangerous.

408
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:16,311
Permit me. I-I've learned
a few primitive words.

409
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:46,446
Anyway, even if you
don't understand...

410
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:50,079
I-I want to thank you for
saving my brother's life.

411
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:58,353
- Happy could do.
- Heavens, he speaks English.

412
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:02,388
First-class shooting, sir.
First time, right through the heart.

413
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,799
No. Shoot through heart...

414
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,930
bird go limp, drop small boy.

415
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:12,374
But shoot back of head...

416
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:17,574
bird go stiff, wings go up.

417
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:23,144
He circle down, land boy safe.

418
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:25,246
Y-You mean, you-you purposely...

419
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:29,157
i-induced motor paralysis
through damage on the medulla?

420
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:32,219
- Not understand.
- Neither do I.
- Can you tell us where our father is?

421
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:34,595
- He was captured by Indians.
- On the 37th parallel.

422
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:37,157
They were kidnapped,
washed up on the shore, captured.

423
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:42,502
Three white men.

424
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:45,304
Indians hold them
for ransom money.

425
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:48,743
- You very slow to come.
- Are they all right?

426
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:53,750
Last time I hear, they are well,
but very tired of being prisoners.

427
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:58,152
Just a minute. What do you mean,
''last time you hear''? Don't you come
from the village where they're held?

428
00:37:58,222 --> 00:38:01,589
No. I'm an Araucanian chief,
Thalcave.

429
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:06,028
My people do not rob, do not steal,
do not hold prisoners for ransom.

430
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:11,057
- Well, where are they?
- Far away, at the foot of the mountain.

431
00:38:11,135 --> 00:38:13,501
Great plain reaches
far as you can see.

432
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:17,905
- Many days to cross.
- The pampas.

433
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:21,309
Well, couldn't you take us there?

434
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:31,682
First we stop at my village
for horses and supplies...

435
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:34,919
then Thalcave will try
help you find them.

436
00:38:56,714 --> 00:39:00,616
Much rain there.
You sleep in tree. May come flood.

437
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:04,052
Flood? By George,
that's a good one.

438
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:08,923
A giant ombu tree,
Phytolacca dioica.

439
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:13,123
- Magnificent specimen.
- Oh, please, may we sleep in it?

440
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:15,495
You can sleep where you like,
but I certainly don't intend to roost...

441
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:18,467
in a tree
like a confounded sparrow.

442
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:20,128
Pitch my tent just here.

443
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:43,151
You in tree, listen!

444
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:47,163
Flood come. Much water.
You stay in tree. I bring help.

445
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:50,530
- My father?
- I wake him.

446
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:54,765
To be safe, we tie things
so they do not fall.

447
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:03,503
Flood come. You go quick to tree.
I ride for help.

448
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:07,611
Not even raining.

449
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,365
Just like on a ship.
Make ready for the storm.

450
00:40:25,436 --> 00:40:27,802
Look! The flood!

451
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,400
- Father! Father!
- John, be careful!

452
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,520
- Father, hurry up!
- Now what's going on?
- Come with me!

453
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:47,752
Can't a fellow get
a decent night's rest in this place?

454
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:50,726
- Come on, Father!
- Oh!

455
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:53,826
Come on.

456
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,006
They've got it!

457
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:12,612
Hold on!

458
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:25,628
Highly irregular, flood like this--
and not even raining.

459
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:57,116
With some food in your stomach, milord,
the world will feel a lot brighter.

460
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:06,230
- Oh! Look out below!
- Oh!

461
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:10,563
Sorry, milord.

462
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:25,819
Why cry about bad weather

463
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,324
Enjoy it

464
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:33,489
Each moment is a treasure
enjoy it

465
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:35,998
We're travelers
on life's highway

466
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,501
Enjoy the trip

467
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:41,265
Each lovely twist and byway

468
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:43,705
Each bump and dip

469
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:48,643
If there's a complication
enjoy it

470
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:53,707
You've got imagination
employ it

471
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:56,275
Then you'll see roses
in the snow

472
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:58,720
Joie de vivre
will make them grow

473
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:02,953
Voilŕ, that's life
Enjoy it

474
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:07,960
Since I must do the cooking
I'll enjoy it

475
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:13,267
This ombu tree smells gorgeous
You'll enjoy it

476
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:19,232
A hurricane comes your way
enjoy the breeze

477
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:24,247
You're stranded in the jungle
enjoy the trees

478
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:29,184
If there's a complication
enjoy it

479
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:34,316
You've got imagination
employ it

480
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:38,852
This tree's a cornucopia
Why, it could be--

481
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:44,334
- Utopia
- Voilŕ, that's right, enjoy it

482
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,927
Why cry about bad weather

483
00:43:48,005 --> 00:43:50,599
- Enjoy it
- No, enjoy

484
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:54,509
Oh, each moment is a treasure
Enjoy it

485
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:58,878
- That's better. Enjoy it.
- We're travelers on life's highway

486
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,510
Enjoy the trip

487
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:06,022
Each lovely twist and byway
each bump and dip

488
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,957
- Good.
- If there's a complication

489
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:11,961
- Enjoy it
- Enjoy it

490
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:15,465
You've got imagination
employ it

491
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:20,095
Employ it
From eggs and herbs au naturel

492
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:23,231
Omelette ombu a la Paganel

493
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:28,210
Pour vous, milord
Enjoy it

494
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:47,955
Voilŕ!

495
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:57,063
Robert, can you
see anything...

496
00:44:57,141 --> 00:45:01,840
that looks like an Indian
on horseback coming to our rescue?

497
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:05,075
- Only some birds.
- Only some--

498
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,994
Only gone down
half an inch in two days.

499
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:22,692
We'll be here for 10 years
at this rate.

500
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:25,531
Cheer up, milord.
We pay no rent.

501
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:28,094
Mother Nature
sets the table for us.

502
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:32,666
And, fortunately,
we have plenty of water.

503
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:35,109
That's very fortunate,
I must say.

504
00:45:37,882 --> 00:45:42,148
- Very fortunate.
- My father will never
trust another Indian.

505
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:45,552
But Thalcave's different.
He said, ''I bring help.''

506
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:48,319
- And he will.
- If he got through.

507
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:50,622
Don't even think such things.

508
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:53,288
All right.
But if I may paraphrase...

509
00:45:53,364 --> 00:45:56,959
what a wise young girl
once said to me many years ago:

510
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:59,025
''If you were marooned
in an ombu tree...

511
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:01,697
and you had some logs
and something to tie them into a raft...

512
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:05,401
you wouldn't just sit there
until you died or something, would you?''

513
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:07,967
That's very good.
For a girl, I mean.

514
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:11,578
I suppose most girls are taught
embroidery and things.

515
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:16,143
But Mother died after Robert was born.
And Father, being a sea captain--

516
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,314
When we first met,
I had a different impression.

517
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,053
Most girls can be rather silly.
Do you know what I mean?

518
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:27,564
- No, I don't.
- Well, you're different.

519
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:32,159
- How different?
- I don't know how to say it.

520
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:36,935
I had it all worked out last night.
Sounds rather silly now, though.

521
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:41,535
- What does?
- Well, you don't expect things
of a girl, certain things...

522
00:46:41,612 --> 00:46:46,606
like climbing mountains, going
through floods, making the most of it.

523
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:49,016
You know what I mean?

524
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:52,388
Don't think I do.

525
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,721
Well, I want to say that...

526
00:46:55,793 --> 00:47:00,958
I think you've been just fine,
for a girl.

527
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:05,730
Oh, what I really mean is that
if we get out of here alive...

528
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:08,636
and when we're old enough--

529
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:11,675
- John!
- Mary!

530
00:47:13,177 --> 00:47:15,509
There's the log
you've needed for your raft.

531
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:26,684
That's it, just what we need.
Perfect!

532
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:32,285
Got it.

533
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:41,130
- Oh!
- Keep out of the way!

534
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:49,268
- It's a tiger!
- No, no, it's a jaguar. Felis onca.

535
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:51,405
Get that beast out of here!

536
00:47:57,021 --> 00:48:00,286
It's probably as frightened
of us as we are of it.

537
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:03,349
- Just a big cat, milord.
- Well, get rid of it. Get rid of it.

538
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:06,260
Can't stand cats
at the best of times.

539
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,730
Confounded things
always make me sneeze.

540
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:17,400
Go on! Get out of here!

541
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:24,680
- Go on! Get out!
- Don't, John! The poor thing.

542
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:33,679
Do not move, not an eyelash.

543
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:27,129
''Marooned in ombu tree.
Latitude, 37 degrees south.

544
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:32,733
Longitude, 66 degrees west.
Send help immediately.''

545
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:12,215
One, two...

546
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:17,117
three, four, five...

547
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:19,178
six, seven.

548
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:26,194
More than two kilometers away.

549
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:30,791
My father always told me,
never go near a tree in a thunderstorm.

550
00:51:30,868 --> 00:51:34,531
One, two, three...

551
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:37,574
four, five.

552
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,734
I think it's getting closer.

553
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,903
Yes. At 35 degrees centigrade...

554
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:46,439
sound travels
at approximately-- one--

555
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:53,856
Great heavens,
the tree's on fire. Look!

556
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:55,983
We'll beat it out.

557
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:20,644
No time for that sort of thing.
Get out of the way!

558
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:28,654
You see? It's too late now.

559
00:52:56,887 --> 00:53:02,018
The oil in the ombu tree, milord,
it has a remarkably low flashpoint.

560
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:21,373
- Onto the raft. It's our only chance.
- Look out!

561
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:28,517
Oh, no!

562
00:53:28,585 --> 00:53:31,645
- I'll get it.
- No, don't!

563
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:43,593
Apparently, we have our choice:
eaten raw down there...

564
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:46,659
or roasted alive up here.

565
00:53:51,275 --> 00:53:56,872
Hold on, everybody. Mother Nature
comes to our rescue. A waterspout!

566
00:55:01,478 --> 00:55:04,675
Ahoy!

567
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:14,180
Ahoy!

568
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,190
We're still several degrees
off course, you know.

569
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:25,257
Hurry up with the canvas.
There's a breeze coming up.

570
00:55:25,335 --> 00:55:28,361
Aye, aye, Captain!

571
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:33,808
You're strangely quiet,
aren't you?

572
00:55:33,877 --> 00:55:37,438
- Sorry, milord. I was thinking.
- I don't know which is worse, by George:

573
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:40,881
having you so happy you sing all the
time, or so glum you won't even talk.

574
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:44,512
''The ombu tree is gorgeous.
Enjoy it.'' Huh.

575
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:51,289
I am stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!

576
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:54,797
I know, but that hasn't
worried you till now.

577
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:58,733
- It is better they do not hear.
- Better they don't hear?
What are you talking about?

578
00:55:58,802 --> 00:56:02,499
It is something
I remembered in the night.

579
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:06,975
- How could I be so stupid?
I don't know, but the shark I caught...
- Land ho!

580
00:56:07,044 --> 00:56:09,808
with the bottle,
it was a mako shark.

581
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,905
- It--
- Ahoy!

582
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:17,352
And as well as I know anything
in the world, I should know that
the mako shark lives only in--

583
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:21,687
Be quiet! Ahoy there!

584
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:26,024
Ahoy. Ahoy there!

585
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:29,031
I think I see it. There.

586
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:37,536
- A canoe!
- Ahoy there! Aho--

587
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:42,850
Good heavens. It's an Indian war canoe.
This is a fine fix.
We're completely unarmed.

588
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:45,752
- It's Thalcave! He did come back!
- What? Thalca--

589
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:49,690
Ho-ho. Thalcave, my good man.
Delighted to see you.

590
00:56:49,759 --> 00:56:53,490
- I bring news.
- News? What kind of news?

591
00:56:53,563 --> 00:56:56,657
You come in canoe.
We go fast to village...

592
00:56:56,733 --> 00:57:00,260
where they hold prisoners,
three sailor men.

593
00:57:00,336 --> 00:57:05,205
Three sailor me--
Oh, monsieur, we've found them!

594
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:08,472
It's like a miracle.
Thank you, my lordship! Thank you!

595
00:57:08,545 --> 00:57:13,312
Oh, I say, I say. Careful. Come along.
Let's get aboard. Careful, now. Careful.

596
00:57:13,383 --> 00:57:17,479
You're a welcome sight, sir,
believe me. Is this thing safe?

597
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:19,852
Forty-six, 47, 48...

598
00:57:19,923 --> 00:57:22,187
49, 50.

599
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,220
Oh, now it's come,
I can hardly believe it.

600
00:57:39,609 --> 00:57:42,373
- We're saved!
- We're saved!

601
00:57:52,288 --> 00:57:56,987
Stop it! Stop it! Who the devil
are these people? Where's Captain Grant?

602
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,893
These not right men?

603
00:57:59,963 --> 00:58:04,900
It's all my fault.
How could I be so stupid?

604
00:58:04,968 --> 00:58:09,166
It's what I started to tell you,
milord, about the mako shark.

605
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:15,371
- What about the blasted thing?
- It lives only in and
around the Indian Ocean.

606
00:58:15,445 --> 00:58:19,108
That's what the-the word ''Indian''
means in the note...

607
00:58:19,182 --> 00:58:21,707
not that they were captured
by Indians.

608
00:58:21,784 --> 00:58:26,187
If you knew this, why didn't you tell me
before I paid out all that money?

609
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:31,421
I kept hoping, milord,
that maybe somehow I could be wrong.

610
00:58:31,494 --> 00:58:33,962
This can mean only one thing:

611
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:37,056
Captain Grant is in Australia.

612
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:39,226
Australia? That's where
I wanted to go in the first place...

613
00:58:39,302 --> 00:58:42,135
only I was stupid enough
to let you talk me out of it.

614
00:58:42,205 --> 00:58:46,437
Oh, my dear children, I'm so sorry
it all had to end like this.

615
00:58:46,509 --> 00:58:49,967
Listen! Thalcave speak.

616
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:53,209
For many years,
my people hunt...

617
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:56,081
trail game many miles.

618
00:58:56,152 --> 00:59:02,148
Sometimes sneak up,
but game not there.

619
00:59:02,225 --> 00:59:07,162
But Indian knows
if game not there...

620
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:11,166
it somewhere else.

621
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:16,831
Keep looking: otherwise,
Indian die out many years ago.

622
00:59:16,906 --> 00:59:20,603
''Keep looking.''
He's right, you know.

623
00:59:20,677 --> 00:59:23,111
Now we know
where Captain Grant really is.

624
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:26,512
And by Jove,
we'll go and find him.

625
00:59:26,582 --> 00:59:29,483
Oh, thank you, Thalcave.

626
00:59:29,552 --> 00:59:31,645
Thank you.

627
01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:08,888
- How does she look to you?
- Just what we need.

628
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:12,519
- Ain't a ship hereabouts
could overhaul her.
- What about the steam?

629
01:00:12,595 --> 01:00:17,055
- We can learn.
- The old man wants to know
what happened to the Britannia.

630
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:20,159
- Maybe I should tell him.
- You're not serious, now, are ya?

631
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:22,363
Maybe I should tell him.

632
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:28,640
The very spot, your lordship,
where she sank beneath the waves.

633
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:30,906
Now, it's me own dear brother
who lost his life...

634
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,881
tryin' to put out in a small boat
to save some of the crew.

635
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,475
- It was shockin'.
- All right, Osborne. Pay 'em off.

636
01:00:36,552 --> 01:00:39,043
- Very good, milord.
- Thank you, lordship.
Much-- Much obliged.

637
01:00:39,122 --> 01:00:42,023
- I don't wanna see any more.
- Very good, milord.

638
01:00:42,091 --> 01:00:44,924
Look at that!
Ridiculous! Preposterous!

639
01:00:44,994 --> 01:00:50,398
How can the same ship go down
in a dozen different places, sometimes
500 miles apart? Answer me that.

640
01:00:50,466 --> 01:00:55,369
Ah, confounded wharf rats! Lie to you,
take your money, cut your throat
if you give 'em half a chance.

641
01:00:55,438 --> 01:00:58,669
How the dickens can I tell
where to start, eh? What do you want?

642
01:00:58,741 --> 01:01:02,074
- Mr. Frederick Ayrton
to see you, milord.
- I told you I didn't want
to see anybody else.

643
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:06,047
- This is a gentleman, your lordship.
- I do hope I haven't arrived
at an awkward moment.

644
01:01:06,115 --> 01:01:09,209
I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner.
I would've warned you not
to offer a reward.

645
01:01:09,285 --> 01:01:11,776
- Well, as a matter of--
- I'm afraid you'll find very little
integrity...

646
01:01:11,854 --> 01:01:14,186
among some of the men
who frequent our waterfront.

647
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:18,193
And it so happens that
I have the very information you require.

648
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:22,459
- About my father?
- Ah, so this is the daughter
of Captain Grant.

649
01:01:22,532 --> 01:01:26,400
Well, if I can reunite this delightful
child and her gallant father...

650
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:28,596
that is the reward I'm interested in.

651
01:01:28,671 --> 01:01:30,866
Were you ever in Plymouth?

652
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:34,273
Plymouth, England?
No, I haven't had that pleasure.

653
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:36,937
May I inquire, sir, as to the nature
of your information?

654
01:01:37,013 --> 01:01:41,746
Oh, well, two years ago,
I was caught in a violent storm
in the Tasman Sea.

655
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:45,379
We picked up a poor fellow,
badly battered and halfdrowned...

656
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:48,788
- just off the coast of New Zealand.
- New Zealand?

657
01:01:48,858 --> 01:01:51,918
He said he was from the Britannia
and that she'd gone down with all hands.

658
01:01:51,994 --> 01:01:55,054
He died during the night, and our ship
combed the area the following day.

659
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:57,463
You know, until I read that piece
in the paper about the message...

660
01:01:57,533 --> 01:02:00,229
in the bottle, I had no idea that
there were any survivors.

661
01:02:00,303 --> 01:02:03,329
But why wasn't the sinking reported
when you reached your destination?

662
01:02:03,406 --> 01:02:06,933
Well, I assumed that it was. I was only
a passenger on the ship, you know.

663
01:02:07,009 --> 01:02:10,968
Heavens. If he landed in New Zealand,
he must've been captured by the Maoris.

664
01:02:11,047 --> 01:02:13,515
I'll report this to the authorities
at once. Osborne!

665
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:16,575
- I'm afraid it isn't as easy as that.
- Why ever not?

666
01:02:16,652 --> 01:02:20,088
You haven't had my experience
in dealing with our colonial government.

667
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:22,590
Eventually, you learn to get along
in spite of them.

668
01:02:22,658 --> 01:02:26,685
They talk endlessly,
and they need authorization from London.

669
01:02:26,762 --> 01:02:29,993
You'll be lucky
if they're ready in a year.

670
01:02:30,066 --> 01:02:34,469
But anything could happen
to him in a year. What do you suggest?

671
01:02:34,537 --> 01:02:37,768
Oh, I-I can't afford
to get mixed up in this.

672
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,038
I've told you all that I know, and--
and I've got my own estates to run.

673
01:02:42,111 --> 01:02:45,376
Sir, the lives of three men
are at stake.

674
01:02:45,448 --> 01:02:48,508
I'd like to speak
to this gentleman alone, please.

675
01:02:56,993 --> 01:03:01,157
The trouble is,
New Zealand is not in the Indian Ocean.

676
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,790
There is something strange,
very strange.

677
01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:06,357
I don't care what it is.
I've seen that man before.

678
01:03:06,435 --> 01:03:09,370
- Oh, you're just imagining it.
- No, I'm not.

679
01:03:09,438 --> 01:03:11,599
Anyway, I can't stand people
who look at me like that.

680
01:03:11,674 --> 01:03:14,438
''Delightful child.''
''Gallant father.''

681
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:17,138
Perhaps it's a good sign that neither
of you take to him...

682
01:03:17,213 --> 01:03:20,376
because it seems that everything else
that you've welcomed with open arms...

683
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:22,440
has turned out dead wrong.

684
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:30,985
Please understand I don't wish
to do anything against the law.

685
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:33,051
-Oh, certainly not.
-But at the same time, I don't intend...

686
01:03:33,129 --> 01:03:36,121
to leave Captain Grant in the hands
of those bloodthirsty cannibals.

687
01:03:36,198 --> 01:03:38,894
So, uh, I appeal
to you as a man with experience...

688
01:03:38,968 --> 01:03:43,530
and knowledge of local conditions
to help us before it's too late.

689
01:03:43,606 --> 01:03:45,972
All right. I'll gather up some men
who know the Maoris...

690
01:03:46,042 --> 01:03:48,567
and who can
handle any kind of situation.

691
01:03:48,644 --> 01:03:51,841
By Jove, you mean we just, uh, go in
and have it out with them?

692
01:03:51,914 --> 01:03:54,849
Oh, good heavens, no. We'll
take along some supplies to barter...

693
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:58,045
and then if Captain Grant and his men
are still alive, we'll buy them back.

694
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,146
Capital idea. I can't tell you
how grateful I am to you.

695
01:04:01,223 --> 01:04:05,523
- I need hardly remind you that we must
be discreet about what we plan to do.
- Ooh, of course, of course.

696
01:04:05,595 --> 01:04:08,223
- Don't want to be tied down
by a lot of confounded red tape, do we?
- No.

697
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:12,825
Just my son John and Captain Mangles.
Otherwise, not a word to a soul.

698
01:04:12,902 --> 01:04:14,893
Yes, just as it should be.

699
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,069
Get this crate down
in the hull, would ya, lads?

700
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,607
Motley looking lot of fellows
you've got together.

701
01:04:27,683 --> 01:04:29,878
Well, when you look for men
to go into Maori country...

702
01:04:29,952 --> 01:04:32,887
you don't choose them
from among the socially elite.

703
01:04:32,955 --> 01:04:37,892
Jolly well put.
But I must say, I didn't realize
you'd require quite so much merchandise.

704
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:42,624
Ooh, I'm afraid the days are gone
when one could impress the natives
with a handful of colored beads.

705
01:04:42,698 --> 01:04:44,723
And if they choose
to sell their prisoners dearly...

706
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,268
we'd better be prepared.

707
01:04:47,336 --> 01:04:49,327
I see.

708
01:04:53,142 --> 01:04:55,736
John, you've got to tell me.
What's going on out there?

709
01:04:55,811 --> 01:04:58,211
Ah, mademoiselle,
you are far too beautiful...

710
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,078
in the new gown to worry your
pretty little head about such things.

711
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,141
But what's in all those boxes?

712
01:05:03,219 --> 01:05:07,053
I would've thought if my father wanted
you to know, he would've told you.

713
01:05:07,123 --> 01:05:10,889
Every man out there looks like
a fugitive from the penal colony.

714
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,488
John, you've got to do something. Don't
let this man make a fool of your father.

715
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,931
Just because he called you ''a delightful
child'' and you don't like it...

716
01:05:20,002 --> 01:05:22,766
you think he's trying
to make a fool of my father.

717
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:27,298
It is better that we think it, monsieur,
than to give him the opportunity
to prove it.

718
01:05:27,376 --> 01:05:29,810
All right. Let me tell you something,
both of you.

719
01:05:29,879 --> 01:05:34,407
Maybe my father
huffs and puffs a little bit,
and we've all smiled at him just in fun.

720
01:05:34,483 --> 01:05:37,975
But I don't think anybody's going to
make a fool of him quite as easily as--

721
01:05:38,054 --> 01:05:41,683
well, certain people I could name.

722
01:05:41,757 --> 01:05:44,191
And now, if you'll excuse me.

723
01:05:47,096 --> 01:05:49,530
Patience, dear.

724
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:54,234
We shall see what we shall see.

725
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:04,608
I'll wager she's faster than any ship
in the Royal Navy.

726
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,274
Good. You know,
I'd say that...

727
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:10,375
steam was the coming thing if it
weren't all so complicated to handle.

728
01:06:10,453 --> 01:06:12,648
Well, you don't have to complicate it.
Actually, it's quite simple.

729
01:06:12,722 --> 01:06:15,122
- Yes?
- Pardon, milord. Uh-Uh, Could I talk...

730
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:17,989
to you sometime before too long?

731
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:22,793
- Certainly. What about?
- No matter how much I think about it,
it is always the same.

732
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:24,992
Captain Grant is in Australia.

733
01:06:25,067 --> 01:06:27,865
There is no possible way the note
could mean he's in New Zealand.

734
01:06:27,937 --> 01:06:30,462
Oh, my dear fellow,
don't worry about that beastly note.

735
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:33,406
Mr. Ayrton knows precisely where
the Britannia went down, don't you?

736
01:06:33,476 --> 01:06:36,411
- Of course.
- Milord, I'd be the happiest man...

737
01:06:36,479 --> 01:06:40,381
in the world if it turns out
that once again, I'm wrong.

738
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:44,044
- I've no doubt you will be.
- If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to see the engine room.

739
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,384
Oh, my dear fellow, delighted.
Take you around myself.

740
01:06:46,455 --> 01:06:49,822
I think you'll find
there's nothing complicated about steam.

741
01:06:52,628 --> 01:06:57,827
It's a beautiful day. Why not enjoy it,
let bygones be bygones?

742
01:06:59,168 --> 01:07:04,162
Now that we're at sea, I can let you in
on our secret, if you're interested.

743
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,176
Those boxes you were wondering about.
Would you like to know what's in them?

744
01:07:08,244 --> 01:07:10,235
Trinkets. Trade goods.

745
01:07:10,312 --> 01:07:13,611
They're for barter with the Maoris so
that we can buy your father's freedom.

746
01:07:13,682 --> 01:07:16,173
- Who told you this?
- Mr. Ayrton.

747
01:07:16,252 --> 01:07:20,245
- And you believed him?
- All right, Miss Suspicious.

748
01:07:20,322 --> 01:07:24,918
If it'll make you more companionable,
I'll take you below and show you.

749
01:07:33,536 --> 01:07:36,164
Well, here you are.

750
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:41,535
All right, Pandora.
Which box do you want me to open?

751
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,774
- That one.
- You sure you don't
have a guilty feeling?

752
01:07:45,848 --> 01:07:48,442
After all, it is rather
like spying on someone...

753
01:07:48,517 --> 01:07:51,611
especially when they've gone
out of their way to be so nice to you.

754
01:07:51,687 --> 01:07:54,679
- Open it.
- I will.

755
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:04,165
Nothing is too much trouble
if it satisfies your curiosity.

756
01:08:07,336 --> 01:08:09,395
Voilŕ, mademoiselle.

757
01:08:12,508 --> 01:08:15,909
''Trade goods. Trinkets,'' he said.

758
01:08:15,978 --> 01:08:19,709
So that's his game. He's using
my father's ship as a gunrunner.

759
01:08:20,649 --> 01:08:24,016
Pity you did that.

760
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:28,045
Wilcox, down here!

761
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:42,103
We've got to warn the others. I'll lead
them off, then you make for the door.

762
01:08:46,075 --> 01:08:49,272
- There he is!
- I see him!

763
01:08:52,781 --> 01:08:55,841
- Ooh! Oh!
- Now, is that a nice way to behave...

764
01:08:55,918 --> 01:08:58,352
when we're taking you
to meet your father?

765
01:09:01,757 --> 01:09:04,692
Come on.

766
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,753
Make no noise. Just stop the paddles.
Anything else, and I'll shoot.

767
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,865
Ever been to New Zealand before?

768
01:09:13,936 --> 01:09:16,131
Yes. Twice.

769
01:09:16,205 --> 01:09:19,470
Do as I tell you, and perhaps
you'll live to make it three times.

770
01:09:22,144 --> 01:09:27,548
- We're stopping.
- That is most strange.

771
01:09:27,616 --> 01:09:31,279
- Raise the hands quietly.
- Do as he says, Robert.

772
01:09:33,155 --> 01:09:37,489
Help! Pirates!
Lord Glenarvan, help!

773
01:09:37,559 --> 01:09:40,357
Come quickly!

774
01:09:40,429 --> 01:09:46,265
Lord Glenarvan, help! Pirates!
Lord Glenarvan!

775
01:09:46,335 --> 01:09:48,360
I thought
I heard the boy call for help.

776
01:09:48,437 --> 01:09:52,999
You did. Now, give me that gun,
and no harm will come to him.

777
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,681
Wait.

778
01:10:06,155 --> 01:10:09,215
I say, you can't put us out there
without oars. It's not human.

779
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:13,250
Oh, the current will carry you to
the shore, if that's any consolation...

780
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:16,264
but I'm afraid we'll have
to keep your crew on board...

781
01:10:16,332 --> 01:10:19,267
until they've taught us the fine points
of using steam.

782
01:10:19,335 --> 01:10:22,702
We're unaccustomed to such luxuries
in the South Pacific.

783
01:10:22,771 --> 01:10:26,366
- You'll pay for this.
- You've got it backwards, old man.

784
01:10:26,442 --> 01:10:31,539
We have been paid for it, and
quite handsomely. Cheer up, Frenchie.

785
01:10:31,613 --> 01:10:33,911
You promised you would
be the happiest man in the world...

786
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:36,713
if you were wrong about Captain Grant
being in Australia.

787
01:10:36,785 --> 01:10:42,621
And you were. Brown and Riley,
lay aloft and stand by to make sail.

788
01:10:42,691 --> 01:10:45,592
- Aye, aye, sir.
- You were in Plymouth!

789
01:10:45,661 --> 01:10:49,119
My father signed you
on the day he sailed.

790
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:51,666
As third mate. What a memory.

791
01:10:51,734 --> 01:10:54,760
You'll hang for this, you know.
I'll see to it personally.

792
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:57,601
I'll make a full report
to the admiralty.

793
01:10:57,673 --> 01:11:01,074
You do that.
And here's a bottle to put it in.

794
01:11:01,143 --> 01:11:04,408
Let's hope it isn't swallowed
by a shark. Lower away!

795
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,948
You'll never get away with this.

796
01:11:07,016 --> 01:11:09,507
That's what Captain Grant said
when we put him over the side...

797
01:11:09,585 --> 01:11:14,579
at this very spot with
his two rather foolishly loyal mates.

798
01:11:14,656 --> 01:11:18,558
If you're lucky, you might all end up
in the same stewpot.

799
01:11:35,844 --> 01:11:38,472
If anyone is interested,
I might explain.

800
01:11:38,547 --> 01:11:42,313
It is the influence
of the west wind drift...

801
01:11:42,384 --> 01:11:46,787
playing against
the east Australian current...

802
01:11:46,855 --> 01:11:50,552
that might drive us
right up onto the shore.

803
01:11:50,626 --> 01:11:53,288
Yes, yes, yes.

804
01:11:55,931 --> 01:11:57,990
That's the second
of my ships he's got.

805
01:11:58,067 --> 01:12:02,003
First the Britannia,
and now my beautiful new steam yacht.

806
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:07,202
It's all clear now.
It was a mutiny.

807
01:12:07,276 --> 01:12:13,181
There's no reason
why he should lie about it.
My father was set adrift here--

808
01:12:13,248 --> 01:12:15,478
Then he must be a prisoner
of the Maoris.

809
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:18,987
What did he mean, we might all end up
in the same stewpot?

810
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:28,758
Not to change the subject, but our
reception committee seems to be waiting.

811
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:34,600
Maoris, hundreds of'em.
Deuce of a fix.

812
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:39,505
No trinkets to bargain with.
What have we got to offer, huh?

813
01:12:39,575 --> 01:12:42,271
Just us, I suppose.

814
01:13:34,062 --> 01:13:37,429
- Good gracious!
- You come as a stranger,
and I take ye in.

815
01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:41,230
I have prepared a place for thee
in the presence of thine enemy.

816
01:13:43,238 --> 01:13:47,140
- It's all right, my dear.
I'm sure he's harmless.
- What think ye now?

817
01:13:47,209 --> 01:13:50,975
I be crazy, eh?
Not a bit of it.

818
01:13:51,046 --> 01:13:56,814
I be smart. Mark ye well
the words of old Bill Gaye.

819
01:13:58,086 --> 01:14:02,580
Bill Gaye! Weren't you the mate
on my father's ship?

820
01:14:04,426 --> 01:14:07,657
Depends entirely
who your father was.

821
01:14:07,729 --> 01:14:11,961
What was his ship?
And who you be, for that matter?

822
01:14:12,034 --> 01:14:15,265
You see, I be smart.

823
01:14:15,337 --> 01:14:18,170
Makes a difference who she is.

824
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,971
I'm Mary Grant. My father's
Captain Grant of the Britannia.

825
01:14:22,044 --> 01:14:25,104
Well, why didn't you say so before?

826
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:27,671
Fine ship, she was.

827
01:14:28,784 --> 01:14:33,448
I walked her decks
across the seven seas.

828
01:14:33,522 --> 01:14:37,788
Woe be onto thee, O Moab,
for thy sons are taken captive.

829
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:41,056
- Who is he?
- Fantastic, he seems to be the mate
from the Britannia.

830
01:14:41,129 --> 01:14:44,462
Do you know where he is?
Can you tell me?

831
01:14:44,533 --> 01:14:47,730
Where is Captain Grant?

832
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:51,136
Have you no eyes?
Can you not see?

833
01:14:51,206 --> 01:14:54,471
- He's gone.
- Where?

834
01:14:54,543 --> 01:14:57,637
Same as before. Diane's Inlet.

835
01:14:57,713 --> 01:15:02,013
- Did the Maoris take him?
- He be smart too.

836
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:07,181
He learns the way to keep alive, for
they need him when they get more guns.

837
01:15:07,256 --> 01:15:10,157
Guns? Then it must be Ayrton.

838
01:15:10,225 --> 01:15:15,253
Aye, that's who it be.
Somehow the devil has got another ship.

839
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:19,357
- Were there three of you?
- Aye, three of us there were.

840
01:15:19,434 --> 01:15:23,336
Captain Grant, McNabb
and old Bill Gaye...

841
01:15:23,405 --> 01:15:26,397
against Ayrton
and all of his mutinous crew.

842
01:15:26,475 --> 01:15:29,171
- The scoundrel!
- Bonjour, monsieur.

843
01:15:29,244 --> 01:15:33,738
My father, Captain Grant-- Did he and
McNabb go together to Diane's Inlet?

844
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:36,909
Nay, my child.
I say unto you:

845
01:15:36,985 --> 01:15:40,250
McNabb, he was not smart.

846
01:15:40,322 --> 01:15:44,053
He was caught
when he tried to escape.

847
01:15:44,126 --> 01:15:45,991
Odd devil.

848
01:15:52,467 --> 01:15:57,200
- What's he laughing at?
- For this child, I have prayed.

849
01:15:57,272 --> 01:16:01,208
And the Lord hath granted my petition,
which I asked of him.

850
01:16:01,276 --> 01:16:06,475
This is the night
the Lord hath given us our salvation.

851
01:16:06,548 --> 01:16:10,211
What think ye? Could a man
force himself through there...

852
01:16:10,285 --> 01:16:14,619
even a man who has gone without food
to make himself as thin as a man can be?

853
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:18,649
Nay. I say unto you,
it is impossible.

854
01:16:18,727 --> 01:16:22,060
It is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle.

855
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:24,928
Robert, do you think you
could crawl through there?

856
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,662
Maybe if I tried very hard.

857
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:34,099
- You be smart too.
- Even if he could,
what good would it do?

858
01:16:34,176 --> 01:16:39,375
I'll show ye now. The Lord helps them
that helps themselves.

859
01:16:43,885 --> 01:16:48,151
Two years we took to make it,
from the hairs of our heads...

860
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:52,023
from the garments we wore,
from a thousand things we gathered.

861
01:16:52,094 --> 01:16:55,552
Absolutely preposterous. What could
the boy possibly do all by himself?

862
01:16:56,932 --> 01:17:01,926
There be more to it than that,
for this be the night of the haka.

863
01:17:02,003 --> 01:17:06,804
Bide ye your time
till the night be well begun...

864
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:10,675
and the horns sound
and the flames leap upward...

865
01:17:10,746 --> 01:17:15,945
and the devil hath
seized the souls of our captors.

866
01:17:16,017 --> 01:17:19,578
Then I will show the way.

867
01:17:50,919 --> 01:17:54,878
- Nobody's looking. Now's your chance.
- Right. Up you go. Up.

868
01:17:58,326 --> 01:18:01,386
- It looks awfully small.
- Go on. Go on!

869
01:18:21,783 --> 01:18:24,513
I'm stuck.

870
01:18:24,586 --> 01:18:26,781
Let out all the air.

871
01:18:44,639 --> 01:18:47,107
Upon my soul, I don't know
which is worse: a crazy man...

872
01:18:47,175 --> 01:18:50,144
who thinks he's smart
or a Frenchman who admits he's stupid.

873
01:19:14,169 --> 01:19:18,606
- Hold that.
- Oh! Ooh-ooh!

874
01:19:18,673 --> 01:19:21,699
Now to get the pendulum swinging.

875
01:19:27,082 --> 01:19:29,710
Oh, do be careful!

876
01:19:46,368 --> 01:19:49,337
Lower away.

877
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:02,546
I have the unhappy feeling we're going
out of the frying pan into the fire.

878
01:20:21,303 --> 01:20:23,828
He can't get over!
The rope's not long enough!

879
01:20:23,905 --> 01:20:26,100
Lower away!

880
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:51,194
- He still can't do it.
- Go on! Lower away!

881
01:20:51,266 --> 01:20:53,894
That's all there is!

882
01:20:56,671 --> 01:21:00,004
Then let her go!

883
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:04,973
He did it!

884
01:21:38,713 --> 01:21:40,943
Tie that down there.

885
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:54,294
Go down it.

886
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:22,215
Go. Bye.

887
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:41,004
- Deuce of a fix this is.
- Off ye go to the mountain.

888
01:22:41,076 --> 01:22:43,874
We'll never outrun these fellas.

889
01:22:55,523 --> 01:22:57,957
By Jove, I never
saw a rope burn like that.

890
01:22:58,026 --> 01:23:01,393
Gunpowder. It's woven in
like a fuse.

891
01:23:21,716 --> 01:23:26,619
Aye, what say ye?
Who be smart now?

892
01:23:36,765 --> 01:23:40,223
''Vengeance is mine.
I will repay,'' said the Lord.

893
01:24:29,517 --> 01:24:32,350
Father, come on!

894
01:24:40,228 --> 01:24:45,598
If this is the sacred volcano
of the taboo, they dare not follow.

895
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:48,397
You know of such things,
even though you be a stranger?

896
01:24:48,469 --> 01:24:51,632
Aye. I be smart too.

897
01:24:53,975 --> 01:24:57,035
Aye. We be two of a kind.

898
01:25:05,653 --> 01:25:09,248
- By Jove, they've stopped.
- What think ye now of old Bill Gaye?

899
01:25:09,324 --> 01:25:12,157
Be he crazy or be he smart?

900
01:25:12,227 --> 01:25:16,186
They dare not set foot here,
for all this is taboo.

901
01:25:17,398 --> 01:25:19,525
I say, that's splendid,
isn't it?

902
01:25:28,009 --> 01:25:31,672
- But they're moving on again!
- A slight miscalculation, milord.

903
01:25:31,746 --> 01:25:34,306
- I'm afraid we're on the wrong volcano.
- Just as I thought.

904
01:25:34,382 --> 01:25:37,749
- Out of the frying pan, into the fire.
- Don't worry, milord.

905
01:25:41,389 --> 01:25:43,880
Some help, please!

906
01:25:50,131 --> 01:25:53,726
- What are you planning to do?
- Uncork the bottle
and let the genie free.

907
01:25:55,603 --> 01:25:58,367
Oh, I've got it!
Everybody, push!

908
01:26:30,905 --> 01:26:34,204
- Lucky shot, that. Chance in a million.
- At the university, milord...

909
01:26:34,275 --> 01:26:37,676
I'm considered the wizard
of the croquet court.

910
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:52,491
Come ye, where we'll be safe.

911
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:43,640
- Oh, it's horrible!
- Have no fear, mademoiselle.

912
01:27:43,711 --> 01:27:47,477
The Maoris can run faster
than the lava. Enjoy it!

913
01:27:53,988 --> 01:27:56,183
And now, Mr. Gaye,
to Captain Grant.

914
01:27:56,257 --> 01:27:58,487
Aye, to Captain Grant!

915
01:28:00,528 --> 01:28:04,294
Follow Bill Gaye!

916
01:28:04,365 --> 01:28:07,232
He's got it all planned out!

917
01:28:20,081 --> 01:28:23,778
All right, Grant.
Tell them there are six more boxes...

918
01:28:23,851 --> 01:28:25,876
nearly 200 rifles
still in the hold.

919
01:28:25,953 --> 01:28:29,218
I'll set the whole lot ashore
as soon as they hand over the money.

920
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:32,225
And how do I know the rest
are as good as this one?

921
01:28:32,293 --> 01:28:35,729
- I give you my word.
- That's what you offered last time...

922
01:28:35,797 --> 01:28:37,890
when you unloaded a pile of junk.

923
01:28:40,935 --> 01:28:45,372
Now, really, Grant.
Every time I do something charitable,
I live to regret it.

924
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,068
Like putting you ashore alive.

925
01:28:48,142 --> 01:28:52,909
And I intend to stay alive by not
recommending rifles I haven't examined.

926
01:29:00,988 --> 01:29:04,151
My beautiful, beautiful yacht.

927
01:29:04,225 --> 01:29:06,352
If they've done anything
to damage her...

928
01:29:06,427 --> 01:29:10,329
I'll have them strung up
by their thumbs.

929
01:29:10,398 --> 01:29:13,765
How did you know
where she was going to be?

930
01:29:13,835 --> 01:29:16,770
This be where
they always unload:

931
01:29:16,838 --> 01:29:19,739
in Diane's Inlet.

932
01:29:19,807 --> 01:29:23,174
In Diane's Inlet? Oh!

933
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,745
In the note, what I thought said
''Indian'' was really--

934
01:29:29,917 --> 01:29:32,112
Oh!

935
01:29:32,186 --> 01:29:37,055
I'm stupid, stupid, stupid!

936
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:42,620
Cheer up, my friend. Your stupidity may
turn out to be of divine inspiration.

937
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:49,201
Mr. Gaye, I thought
we were going to find Father.

938
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:53,502
We be. We be. Look ye now.

939
01:29:56,844 --> 01:30:00,245
It's Father!

940
01:30:00,314 --> 01:30:03,477
He looks well, thank goodness.

941
01:30:04,619 --> 01:30:08,350
- They're all getting into boats.
- They're comin' here.

942
01:30:08,422 --> 01:30:11,448
We have but little time
to prepare our reception.

943
01:30:43,357 --> 01:30:45,825
- I come to see thy ship.
- No one can come aboard.

944
01:30:45,893 --> 01:30:49,954
Surely ye be not afraid
of old Bill Gaye?

945
01:30:50,031 --> 01:30:55,560
- Bill Gaye?
- ''The hoary head is a crown of glory.''

946
01:30:55,636 --> 01:30:58,366
Know ye not that?

947
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:11,985
- How many do you want, Lucky?
- That'll do.

948
01:31:12,053 --> 01:31:15,250
How many cards do you want?

949
01:31:15,323 --> 01:31:19,123
- So where's mine?
- I gave you them.

950
01:31:19,193 --> 01:31:21,491
What a hand here. Right.

951
01:31:24,599 --> 01:31:27,898
How do we get past him?

952
01:31:32,506 --> 01:31:35,839
Excuse me, sir,
but is this Lord Glenarvan's yacht?

953
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:38,606
Well, sonny, I guess--

954
01:31:38,679 --> 01:31:42,581
Here. Wait a minute. Ain't you the boy
that's with that lot? Come back here!

955
01:32:05,906 --> 01:32:10,400
- Your lordship.
- We haven't got the keys, Captain.
We'll have to break the door down
best we can.

956
01:32:10,478 --> 01:32:12,810
- Put out your decks, gentlemen.
- I'm busted.

957
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,007
- See if Thompson'll play.
He's got money.
- Yeah. All right.

958
01:32:15,082 --> 01:32:17,073
- Your deal, Bob.
- Right. Here you are.

959
01:32:17,151 --> 01:32:19,585
Riley, come here quick!

960
01:32:21,756 --> 01:32:24,953
- The brig!
- The brig!

961
01:32:32,633 --> 01:32:37,400
Know ye not what the Good Book says? ''He
that diggeth a pit shall fall into it''?

962
01:32:52,019 --> 01:32:55,079
Send him over to me.

963
01:32:59,427 --> 01:33:02,487
Ooh, got him! Quick.

964
01:33:43,504 --> 01:33:46,905
I suppose we'll have to open every box.
Put the best ones on top.

965
01:33:46,974 --> 01:33:50,000
Ayrton, you scoundrel!

966
01:33:50,077 --> 01:33:54,070
Don't move. You may
live long enough to hang.

967
01:33:54,148 --> 01:33:59,279
Hello, Glenarvan.
Welcome aboard.

968
01:33:59,353 --> 01:34:02,789
Well, here we are.
This makes us even, doesn't it, uh?

969
01:34:02,857 --> 01:34:05,451
You've got your ship back,
and I'm bringing you Captain Grant...

970
01:34:05,526 --> 01:34:07,517
so, uh, why don't we, uh--

971
01:34:07,595 --> 01:34:10,996
Captain, take him below
with the rest of the scoundrels.

972
01:34:14,702 --> 01:34:17,535
Aye, ye've sown the wind...

973
01:34:17,605 --> 01:34:20,665
and I say to you,
you shall reap the whirlwind.

974
01:34:40,761 --> 01:34:43,389
Back, you dogs! Back, I say!

975
01:34:45,433 --> 01:34:47,492
Bill Gaye! What on earth--

976
01:34:47,568 --> 01:34:51,766
- Father!
- Mary. Robert!

977
01:34:57,077 --> 01:35:00,911
You think I be crazy, don't ye?

978
01:35:00,981 --> 01:35:04,144
See now,
how are the mighty fallen.

979
01:35:06,754 --> 01:35:09,052
- How on earth did you find me out here?
- Monsieur Paganel.

980
01:35:09,123 --> 01:35:12,388
- He's a French professor.
- He found a note in a bottle.
- Lord Glenarvan took us on his yacht.

981
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,690
- And we've been all around the world
looking for you.
- South America.

982
01:35:14,762 --> 01:35:17,458
- And we were captured by Maoris.
- Maoris!

983
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:21,561
My dear children.

984
01:35:21,635 --> 01:35:25,264
Oh, how I've prayed
for this day.

985
01:35:25,339 --> 01:35:28,900
- I was beginning to give up hope
that I'd ever see you again.
- I must be catching a cold.

986
01:35:28,976 --> 01:35:34,471
And now you're suddenly here, and I'm
able to hold you both close in my arms.

987
01:35:39,353 --> 01:35:42,720
I can't find words to
express my gratitude to all of you.

988
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:46,954
We would've been here months earlier if
I hadn't been so stupid about the note.

989
01:35:47,027 --> 01:35:49,962
- The note?
- Yes. The-The note in-in the bottle.

990
01:35:51,165 --> 01:35:53,292
The note in the bottle?

991
01:35:56,537 --> 01:36:00,496
What think ye now? It was I
put that note in the bottle.

992
01:36:01,675 --> 01:36:05,475
And put the bottle in the sea.
''Cast thy bread on the waters...

993
01:36:05,546 --> 01:36:07,980
for thou shall find it
after many days.''

994
01:36:08,048 --> 01:36:11,643
But they seemed so sure
it was their father's handwriting.

995
01:36:11,719 --> 01:36:15,712
- It was, wasn't it?
- Now you know my secret...

996
01:36:15,789 --> 01:36:18,587
why I ran away to sea.

997
01:36:18,659 --> 01:36:22,095
The voice is the voice
of a God-fearing man...

998
01:36:22,162 --> 01:36:26,155
but the hands
are the hands of a forger.

999
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:36,874
- Oh, my word!
- Bill, you scoundrel!

1000
01:36:39,246 --> 01:36:43,239
Just think. If he hadn't
put the note in the bottle...

1001
01:36:43,317 --> 01:36:45,342
and if Monsieur Paganel
hadn't caught that shark--

1002
01:36:45,419 --> 01:36:49,014
And if you hadn't tried to slap my face
that morning on the way to Plymouth...

1003
01:36:49,089 --> 01:36:51,717
I wouldn't have talked my father
into making this trip.

1004
01:36:53,894 --> 01:36:58,558
- Funny how things work out, isn't it?
- Isn't it?

1005
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,361
Here we are, all of us together.

1006
01:37:02,436 --> 01:37:04,734
All of us.

1007
01:37:07,274 --> 01:37:10,141
Did you ever see so many stars?

1008
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:13,475
Once, on top of a mountain.

1009
01:37:13,547 --> 01:37:18,041
Did you know that down there, out of the
light, you can see the Southern Cross?

1010
01:37:18,118 --> 01:37:20,382
Southern Cross?

1011
01:37:26,527 --> 01:37:30,554
So, that's my little girl.

1012
01:37:30,631 --> 01:37:32,861
By George, they do grow up.

1013
01:37:36,136 --> 01:37:39,299
Uh-Uh, I was just thinking
to myself.

1014
01:37:39,373 --> 01:37:42,137
No matter
where you are in the world...

1015
01:37:42,209 --> 01:37:45,975
it is always different,
but it is always the same.

1016
01:37:46,046 --> 01:37:48,674
In English, you would say...

1017
01:37:48,749 --> 01:37:53,049
''All climates
are the same for love.''

1018
01:37:58,292 --> 01:38:01,455
There it is.
The Southern Cross.
