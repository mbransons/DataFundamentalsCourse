1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:02,818
<i>Gone are my blues
and gone are my tears</i>

3
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:06,458
<i>I've got good news
to shout in your ears</i>

4
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:10,178
<i>The long lost dollar has come
back to the fold</i>

5
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:13,658
<i>With silver you can turn
your dreams to gold</i>

6
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:17,778
<i>We're in the money
We're in the money</i>

7
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,658
<i>We've got a lot of what it takes
to get along!</i>

8
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:25,498
<i>We're in the money
The sky is sunny</i>

9
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:29,298
<i>Old man depression you are through
You done us wrong!</i>

10
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:32,818
<i>We never see a headline
'bout a breadline today</i>

11
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:37,538
<i>And when we see the landlord
we can look that guy right in the eye</i>

12
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:40,778
<i>We're in the money
Come on, my honey</i>

13
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:43,938
<i>Let's lend it, spend it
send it rolling around</i>

14
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:48,338
<i>We're in the money
I say, we're in the money</i>

15
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:52,618
<i>We've got a lot of what it takes
to get along!</i>

16
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:55,658
<i>We're in the money
Look up, the skies are sunny</i>

17
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:58,898
<i>Old man depression you are through
You done us wrong!</i>

18
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,098
<i>We never see a headline
'bout a breadline today</i>

19
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:07,298
<i>And when we see the landlord
we can look that guy right in the eye</i>

20
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,458
<i>We're in the money
Come on, my honey</i>

21
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:13,978
<i>Let's lend it, spend it
send it rolling around</i>

22
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:16,458
<i>We're in the money
Come on, my honey</i>

23
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:20,538
<i>Let's lend it, spend it
send it rolling around</i>

24
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,138
- Hey, who are you?
- You'll find out.

25
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,458
Come on, boys.

26
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,858
Might as well begin right here.

27
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:55,818
Get out of here.

28
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:59,538
Hey, you, go take them clothes off.

29
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:01,978
Go on. Come on, you punk, get out of here.

30
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,738
Come on,
get these music racks out of here.

31
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,378
Wait a minute. What is this?

32
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,258
- Well, who are you?
- I'm Barney Hopkins...

33
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:11,298
- producer of this show.
- Oh, yeah?

34
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:13,938
It's tough luck, brother.
I'm from the sheriff's office.

35
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:16,698
Legal attachment to collect for the credit.

36
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,858
<i>- Corpus delicti, or seize the body.
- What, again?</i>

37
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:24,298
- Don't you dare.
- Don't worry, sis, this will look nice...

38
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:26,178
in the sheriff's office.

39
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:30,778
- What's the excitement?
- It means they close the show, dumbbell.

40
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,538
Give me that costume.

41
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:35,538
- I beg your pardon.
- Well, we've got to take it back, actress.

42
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,818
Well, that's as far back as it goes.

43
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:39,458
Sorry, miss, they got to have that top.

44
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,978
- You can at least give me car fare.
- What for?

45
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:44,418
This is our dress rehearsal.
We got a great show.

46
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:45,978
It opens tomorrow night.

47
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,298
You can't do this to me
just because I don't pay a few bills.

48
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:53,018
- When the show opens, I will pay up.
- Tell it to the sheriff.

49
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:57,778
This is the fourth show in two months
that I've been in of and out of.

50
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,978
They close before they open.

51
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:02,578
The Depression, dearie.

52
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:40,818
I can remember
when that alarm clock used to ring.

53
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:43,938
Those good old days
when you had to get up.

54
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:46,378
Come on, let's get up and look for work.

55
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,498
I hate starving in bed.

56
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:51,978
- Name me a better place to starve.
- Your stomach.

57
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:55,378
Let's get up and get dressed.

58
00:05:56,338 --> 00:06:00,618
I thought we might try the flea circus.
Maybe they got something for us there.

59
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:04,018
- What can we get at a flea circus?
- Fleas.

60
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:08,378
- You can get those here.
- All right. Come on, let's get up.

61
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:13,018
One, two, three.

62
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:22,618
- How about some nourishment?
- Yeah, what's on the menu, Trixie?

63
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:24,898
We'll see what the neighbors have to offer.

64
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:27,658
- You guys cut the bread and set the table.
- Have we any bread?

65
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:29,578
Yeah, have we any table?

66
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,258
What neighbors?

67
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,938
I can remember not so long ago
a penthouse on Park Avenue.

68
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:58,498
With a real tree, and flowers,
and a fountain, and a French maid.

69
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:01,138
And a warm bath with salt from Yardley's.

70
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:03,298
And a little dress that Schiaparelli ran up.

71
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:06,298
And a snappy roadster,
and a ride through the park.

72
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:07,898
Now stealing milk.

73
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,818
That's all right.
The dairy company stole it from a cow.

74
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,578
Just about a year ago this time,
I was on my way to Havana.

75
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:16,298
The birds were singing
and the sky was blue.

76
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:20,378
And I said to the big mug in the next pew,
"I need $200, big boy."

77
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:23,658
And he said, "In my pants pocket."

78
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:29,018
You know, I reached over and I took $500
out of his back pants pocket just like that.

79
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:32,578
And all I got left are his pajamas,
and I'm a milk snatcher.

80
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:36,218
Guess we got to give it back.

81
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:40,378
Maybe it's the piano remover.

82
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:48,818
- Fay!
- Who'd you think it was, the wolf?

83
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:52,138
If it was, we'd eat it.
Why the blue spectacles, grandma?

84
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:54,458
So the landlady won't recognize me.

85
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:57,178
I'm obligated to her
for a little item called rent.

86
00:07:57,258 --> 00:08:00,098
If you've come to make a touch,
the bank has folded.

87
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:04,218
Your millions are safe, Trixie.
I came to tell you gals good news.

88
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:07,138
Barney's putting on a new show.

89
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:08,978
- Barney?
- Barney Hopkins?

90
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:11,418
- Rehearsals start in two weeks.
- He must have found an angel.

91
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:12,618
Come on, let's go over and find out.

92
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:15,498
That's right. As soon as the mob finds out,
they'll all be after him.

93
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,858
- Come on, let's hurry.
- We can't all go.

94
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:19,658
We haven't got enough decent clothing
left to wrap around one of us.

95
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:22,978
Yeah, and if one doesn't look modish
with Barney, it's thumbs down.

96
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:24,378
Let's see if we can scare up enough...

97
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,538
to make at least one of us look,
as you say, modish.

98
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,258
- Who's to go?
- Let's match for it.

99
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,538
- Taxis.
- Yellow.

100
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:30,778
- Checkered.
- Red top.

101
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:31,978
Black and white.

102
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:44,098
- Checkered!
- Checkered!

103
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,458
- Carol wins.
- Gee.

104
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:48,538
I look much better in clothes
than any of you.

105
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:52,338
- Lf Barney could see me in clothes...
- He wouldn't recognize you.

106
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:53,898
Say, what happened
to your lovely mink coat?

107
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:56,738
Uncle's got it. Uncle's got everything.
We've even hocked our inlays.

108
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:58,498
Honey, you'll have to give me
my stockings back.

109
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:00,538
- Sure, there they are.
- Fay?

110
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:02,098
You got to give Carol that dress.

111
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:03,898
Don't, I'e got to go back to the drugstore.

112
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:06,018
We'll give you something good enough
for a drugstore.

113
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:08,378
I know, but the dress belongs to them.
I'm a hostess there.

114
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,258
- Stand still.
- So am I a hostess.

115
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:14,138
I've got to entertain Barney
with the idea of putting us to work.

116
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:18,378
Don't forget to stand in the light, Carol,
when you're talking to Barney.

117
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,858
They certainly know what they're doing...

118
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,738
when they dress
their hostesses in that drugstore.

119
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:24,178
- Well, you don't look bad.
- Now, take these papers...

120
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:26,298
get through the enemy's lines,
and ride like blazes.

121
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:28,058
- Taxi fare.
- Lots of luck, Carol.

122
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:29,218
Thanks.

123
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:31,418
Here we go, laughing and wondering.

124
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,938
Say, watch yourself in the clinches.
Don't forget that dress...

125
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:35,218
belongs to the drugstore.

126
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:36,778
I'd like to meet that druggist.

127
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:41,138
Now, the best comedian on Broadway
will proceed to make beds.

128
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:43,898
Well, I'm going to get a glass of milk.

129
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:02,818
<i>In the shadows
let me come and sing to you</i>

130
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:09,658
<i>Let me dream a song that I can bring</i>

131
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:10,978
<i>To you</i>

132
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:17,978
<i>Take me in your arms
and let me cling to you</i>

133
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,018
<i>Let me linger long</i>

134
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,498
<i>Let me live my song</i>

135
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,938
<i>In the winter, let me bring the spring</i>

136
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,858
<i>To you</i>

137
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:43,858
<i>Let me feel that I mean everything</i>

138
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,898
<i>To you</i>

139
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,698
<i>Love's old song</i>

140
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,458
<i>Will be new</i>

141
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:04,898
<i>In the shadows, when I come and sing</i>

142
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:06,778
<i>To you</i>

143
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:09,018
<i>Dear</i>

144
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,898
<i>In the shadows</i>

145
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:16,538
<i>When I come and sing</i>

146
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:21,018
<i>To you</i>

147
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,658
You can't turn these sheets anymore.
They've only got two sides.

148
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,858
Polly, will you quit mooning over
that good-for-nothing songwriter again?

149
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:44,218
- Now where's that going to get you?
- He's wonderful, Trixie.

150
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:47,458
- Honey, he's a songwriter.
- So is Irving Berlin.

151
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:50,338
- What's wrong about being a songwriter?
- How long have you known him?

152
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,538
Two weeks?
What do you know about him?

153
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,938
I knew everything I wanted to know
the minute I met him.

154
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,338
- Maybe it's Carol.
- Oh.

155
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:01,698
Hello.

156
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:06,338
It's true, it's really true.
He's putting on a show.

157
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:09,018
It's true. Barney's putting on a show.

158
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:12,738
We're coming right up to the apartment.
Be there in 10 minutes.

159
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,658
Phone all the girls.
Phone Fay and Ruth and Mary and Gwen.

160
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:20,378
Phone them all. Tell them to come
right up to the apartment.

161
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:24,378
- He hasn't cast yet, no.
- Hurry and don't lose him.

162
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:26,458
- They're coming up.
- Who?

163
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:29,338
Barney and Carol. Phone Fay.
Phone all the girls. We're all set.

164
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:31,778
No, you phone them.
I've got to dig up the old sex appeal.

165
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:34,858
The way I feel this morning
I'll need a steam shovel.

166
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,898
Half a mile, four, eight...

167
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:41,578
Step on it, Polly.
They ought to be here any minute now.

168
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:43,378
Almost ready.

169
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:47,298
Gosh, to think that we're going to have
real jobs again, earn money.

170
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:50,258
Yeah, and I've been
off the gold standard so long.

171
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:51,738
It's them.

172
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:56,498
- Come on in, Barney, and meet the girls.
- Hello, Mr. Hopkins.

173
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:59,138
- Howdy. Howdy.
- Hello, Mr. Hopkins.

174
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,778
I've seen that face before.

175
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:07,538
Well, if it isn't Barney.
Good old, smiling, big-hearted Barney.

176
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:10,578
- Barney, we hear you're putting on a show.
- Yes, I'm doing a show.

177
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:13,498
You sound more enthusiastic than usual.
Does that mean it's good?

178
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:16,218
You said it's good.
It's the finest thing I ever had.

179
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:20,298
Come on over here and sit down
and tell us all about it, Mr. Hopkins.

180
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:23,018
Well, I've figured it out
from every angle, kids.

181
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:25,138
And I can't see
how it'll run less than six months...

182
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,058
or gross less than half a million.

183
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:31,338
That's figuring on $30,000 a week.
At the Broadhurst we could do $40,000.

184
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,298
- We'll do $40,000 with this show.
- Gosh.

185
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,138
- I remember you.
- Do you?

186
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:39,898
You were in the chorus.

187
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,138
Someday you're coming out of the chorus.

188
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:46,138
- Thank you, Mr. Hopkins.
- Could you use me, too, Mr. Hopkins?

189
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:49,218
Sure, I'm going to use all the girls
I used before.

190
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:51,538
Carol, here, will be featured...

191
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:53,978
and Trixie as comic.

192
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:57,178
I got some ideas
for song numbers for you, honey...

193
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:58,938
that will drape them over their seats.

194
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:01,938
- Something new, different.
- What's the show about?

195
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:05,178
- It's all about the Depression.
- We won't have to rehearse that.

196
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:07,018
Now, it's my idea...

197
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:15,138
- Who's that playing?
- Some palooka songwriter.

198
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:17,178
I don't know that number, what is it?

199
00:14:17,218 --> 00:14:19,258
It's his own. He composes music.

200
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:20,938
Shut the window
and let's get on with this.

201
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,418
Wait a minute.

202
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:25,458
That's not bad.
Ask the fellow to come on over.

203
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:27,178
Brad.

204
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:29,658
- Hello.
- Come on over, quick.

205
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:30,978
All right.

206
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:35,258
You know,
that number's got a great feel to it.

207
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,658
- The boy's got something.
- Yeah, a piano.

208
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:38,658
What's he done?

209
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:41,458
He hasn't had a chance to do anything yet,
Mr. Hopkins.

210
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,658
- But he has genius.
- Yeah?

211
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,218
Well, the show business
could stand a little genius.

212
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,458
Barney, what's the idea of wasting time
with a genius...

213
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,818
when there's hard-working girls like us
to worry about?

214
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:58,458
- What is it, honey?
- Come on, I want you to meet somebody.

215
00:14:58,538 --> 00:15:00,258
This is Brad Roberts, Mr. Hopkins.

216
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:03,338
- Mr. Hopkins is our producer.
- Never mind that. Sit down and play.

217
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:05,738
- Play what?
- That number you were just playing.

218
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:08,058
- I know, but l...
- Don't be afraid, you're among friends.

219
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:10,338
- Go on, Brad.
- Well, all right.

220
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,018
I beg your pardon.

221
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:16,218
Say, what's this all about, anyway?

222
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,938
Go ahead and play.
Sing it if you got words.

223
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,898
All right. Here goes.

224
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:27,058
<i>I've got to sing a torch song</i>

225
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,058
<i>For that's the way I feel</i>

226
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:34,938
<i>When I feel a thing</i>

227
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:37,618
<i>Then I can sing</i>

228
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,378
<i>It must be real</i>

229
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:47,258
<i>I couldn't sing a gay song</i>

230
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:51,538
<i>It wouldn't be sincere</i>

231
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,818
<i>I could never croon</i>

232
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:57,658
<i>A happy tune</i>

233
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:01,138
<i>Without a tear</i>

234
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:06,898
<i>I have my dreams, but one by one</i>

235
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:09,778
<i>They vanish in the sky</i>

236
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:15,658
<i>I try to smile and face the sun</i>

237
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:19,578
<i>But romance passes by</i>

238
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,978
<i>I've got to sing a torch song</i>

239
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:30,458
<i>To someone far apart</i>

240
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:34,098
<i>For the torch I bear</i>

241
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:37,178
<i>Is burning there</i>

242
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:42,138
<i>Right in</i>

243
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,898
<i>My heart</i>

244
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:50,218
That's great. I like it.

245
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,418
- You got anything else?
- Yes, I have a couple of things.

246
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:54,538
- Well, play them. Play them.
- All right.

247
00:17:03,418 --> 00:17:06,498
Hello, Mr. Hopkins.
Charming to see you again.

248
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,178
Sit down.

249
00:17:12,218 --> 00:17:14,538
No, I don't like that, son. It's too dull.

250
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:18,778
What is this, a piano lesson?
Or are we going to hear about this show?

251
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,858
Say, have you got something with kind of
a march effect, march rhythm to it?

252
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,298
Yes, I have.
I have something about a forgotten man.

253
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,418
- But I don't have the words to it yet.
- Play it, play it.

254
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:31,458
I tell you,
I just got the idea for it last night.

255
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:34,338
I was down on Times Square,
watching those men in the breadline...

256
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,818
standing there in the rain,
waiting for coffee and doughnuts.

257
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:39,138
Men out of a job, around the soup kitchen.

258
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:40,178
Stop!

259
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:41,978
Go on.

260
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:44,258
That's it! That's what this show's about!

261
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:46,938
The Depression, men marching,
marching in the rain.

262
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:50,178
Doughnuts and crullers,
men marching, marching...

263
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:54,338
jobs, jobs, and in the background,
Carol, spirit of the Depression.

264
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:58,298
A blue song.
No, not a blue song, but a wailing.

265
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:03,778
And this gorgeous woman singing
this song that'll tear their hearts out.

266
00:18:03,898 --> 00:18:07,018
The big parade. The big parade of tears.

267
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,338
That's it. Work on it.

268
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:13,778
- I'd like to do a specialty.
- Sit down. You'll do a blackout.

269
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,338
I'll cancel my contract
with Warren and Dubin. They're out.

270
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,378
I want you to write the music
for this show, and the lyrics.

271
00:18:21,418 --> 00:18:23,898
- Can you write lyrics?
- You bet he can.

272
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:28,698
I've got it all figured out,
and I want your stuff, son. It's great.

273
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:31,978
- I definitely want it.
- Mr. Hopkins, you can have it...

274
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:33,658
on one condition.

275
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:34,738
Yeah?

276
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:37,938
If Miss Parker, Polly,
has a principal part in the show.

277
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:40,378
She's helped me a lot,
and she's really great herself.

278
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,818
You're telling me? I'm telling you.

279
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:44,378
And I'll tell you something else, too.

280
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,378
You got a swell voice
and a great personality.

281
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:51,538
You're different. You've got class.
I want you to sing in this show.

282
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,138
Thanks a lot, but that's impossible.

283
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:58,138
Now listen, you and Polly would make
a swell team, like the Astaires.

284
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,418
You'd be a knockout
for the mushy interest...

285
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:03,618
- I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
- But, Brad, why not?

286
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:05,298
I can't, honey, for a lot of reasons.

287
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,818
Let me get in on this. Isn't there
going to be any comedy in this show?

288
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,818
Plenty.

289
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:14,458
The gay side, the hard boiled side, the
cynical and funny side of the Depression.

290
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:17,298
I'll make them laugh at you
starving to death, honey.

291
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:20,378
- Be the funniest thing you ever did.
- Did you ever see me ride a pony?

292
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:23,418
- When do rehearsals begin, Barney?
- Rehearsals?

293
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,338
- When I get the money.
- Get the money?

294
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,378
Money?

295
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,818
That's always the way it is. I got the show,
I got the music, I got the cast...

296
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:35,418
I got the theater, all raring to go...

297
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:37,858
and it's the old, old story. Money.

298
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,858
- No money at all?
- Not even the old shoestring.

299
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:43,618
- But you said... You let us think that...
- What did I let you think?

300
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:46,578
I told you I had a great show, and I have.

301
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:48,098
But you said it was all set.

302
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:50,698
It is set. It's been set for six months.

303
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:54,098
Every time I get an angel to put up
the bankroll, something happens.

304
00:19:54,178 --> 00:19:55,538
I had one yesterday.

305
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:58,458
Only today, he came to me
and said he and his wife...

306
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:01,058
who was suing him for divorce,
had become reconciled...

307
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:04,138
and she didn't want him fooling around
in the show business.

308
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:05,938
And here I am, holding the bag.

309
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:08,538
You've got your nerve, Barney.
What about these girls?

310
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:11,298
They've given up jobs
just because you said that...

311
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,458
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

312
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:16,018
Gee, it's tough enough
without you making mugs out of us.

313
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:18,858
- We counted on this, all of us.
- Wait a minute, kids.

314
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:22,818
I'm not going to let you down.
I've got other irons in the fire.

315
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:25,418
Two men are due here tomorrow
from out of town.

316
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:28,218
- Texas cattle.
- Yeah, Texas cattle.

317
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,418
How can they sell cattle?
Who eats meat anymore?

318
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,938
- All I can say is...
- How much do you need?

319
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,898
- $50,000.
- There isn't $50,000 in the world.

320
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:39,498
Not to put a show on with, anyway.

321
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:43,378
All right then, who needs $50,000?
Make it $40,000, $25,000.

322
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,498
If I wanted to chisel,
and I know how to chisel...

323
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,818
I could do it for $15,000, but...

324
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:50,258
I'll advance you $15,000.

325
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:54,858
Say, what does he use? I'll smoke it, too.
Quit joking, will you?

326
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:57,178
It isn't smart to make gags
when girls are starving.

327
00:20:57,258 --> 00:21:00,018
Brad, this is too serious a matter
to all of us.

328
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:01,978
Honey, I mean it. I'll be glad to do it.

329
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:03,658
Where can you get $15,000?

330
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:06,258
He means real money,
not streetcar transfers.

331
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:09,218
Remember, one condition:
Polly is featured.

332
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:10,858
Anything you say.

333
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:18,258
Nope. I can't give you a check
for certain reasons.

334
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:20,018
I'll give you cash tomorrow.
Is that all right?

335
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:23,778
- You fell for it, Barney.
- He did. He fell for it.

336
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:25,658
That's what's commonly known as a gag.

337
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,178
It's not a gag. I mean it.

338
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:30,218
Tomorrow I'll be in your office at 10:30.
You have my word for it.

339
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,378
I'm going to go work on that number
a little, so I'll see you later.

340
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,898
Goodbye, honey.

341
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,858
- Brad.
- Yes?

342
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:54,218
- Brad, this is cruel.
- What, honey?

343
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:57,978
- To kid about a thing like this.
- I'm not kidding. I'll give him the money.

344
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:00,898
He'll have it in his office
at 10:30 tomorrow morning.

345
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:04,938
- Where are you going to get $15,000?
- Well, honey, I'll tell you...

346
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:10,178
See this ring? I just give it a little twist,
make a wish, presto.

347
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,898
- Brad.
- Trust me, will you, honey?

348
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:15,498
- And I'm not joking.
- That's just the trouble.

349
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:17,458
- I do trust you.
- Oh, honey.

350
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,898
- What?
- No, I won't say it yet.

351
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:23,458
I have an idea, and I want to get
to the piano before I lose it.

352
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:24,978
See you later.

353
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:44,178
He meant it. Really, he did.
I'd stake my life on it.

354
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,338
Faith, hope, and charity.

355
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:49,938
You have faith, Barney hopes,
and we all need charity.

356
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,418
Wait a minute.

357
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:03,498
Listen.

358
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,338
He's got it. Just what I want.

359
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,378
Don't you hear that wailing? Wailing.

360
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:15,058
Men marching, marching,
marching in the rain.

361
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,818
Jobs.

362
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:20,298
Gee, don't it get you?

363
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:49,778
- Well?
- There's no answer...

364
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:51,418
at Mr. Roberts' apartment.

365
00:23:51,618 --> 00:23:55,538
Now Trixie can say, "I told you so,"
but I won't. It hurts too much.

366
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,618
Come in.

367
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:02,378
Gigolo Eddie always shows up
at the wrong time.

368
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:06,738
Hello, Barney. Heard you got your mitts
on some dough to open a show.

369
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:10,338
Thought you might want to celebrate.
Fresh off the boat.

370
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:14,618
Well, you heard wrong. Pull up a coffin
and lie down with the rest of us.

371
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:18,298
Business is so tough that nobody
even wants to owe me anymore.

372
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:21,538
- You can go.
- But you hired me for the day.

373
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,898
I thought I was going to need a secretary.

374
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:27,738
Well, you'll pay me for the day,
or I'll make a complaint to the agency.

375
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:30,818
I wish there was somebody
I could complain to.

376
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:44,658
- Who are you?
- We're the Zipky Kentucky Hillbillies.

377
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:47,058
- Who?
- The Kentucky Hillbillies.

378
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:48,378
- Singing.
- Dancing.

379
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,338
- Music.
- Wisecracks.

380
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:53,498
<i>- Do you know Your Old Kentucky Home?
- You said it.</i>

381
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:56,378
Scram right back there.
Your old mammy's waiting for you.

382
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:57,698
We get it.

383
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:07,458
I better lock this joint before the acrobats
and midgets start flocking in.

384
00:25:10,338 --> 00:25:13,818
- Good morning. You're early.
- I'm sorry I kept you all waiting.

385
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:15,298
- Yeah?
- I got a new idea for a number...

386
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:17,858
and I lost all track of time.
Got a piano? I'll play it for you.

387
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,778
Hey, listen, kid,
I'm the comedian around here.

388
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,578
We've had enough of your gags.
They're not funny.

389
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:24,378
Please stop it, Brad.
There's a limit to everything.

390
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,698
I'm going to lock this office.
Get out of here, all of you.

391
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,578
- Don't you want the money?
- Don't kid me.

392
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:30,818
There you are. $15,000, cash.

393
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:33,578
Brad, I always knew you were on the level.

394
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:35,938
Rehearsals start at 9:00 in the morning.

395
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:37,658
Fresh off the boat.

396
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:41,938
<i>Pettin'in the park</i>

397
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,098
<i>Bad boy!</i>

398
00:25:43,178 --> 00:25:44,458
<i>Pettin'in the park</i>

399
00:25:44,538 --> 00:25:46,778
<i>Bad girl!
First you pet a little</i>

400
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:47,898
<i>Let up a little</i>

401
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:49,978
<i>And then you get a little kiss</i>

402
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:51,698
<i>Pettin' on the sly</i>

403
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:52,858
<i>Oh, my!</i>

404
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:55,338
<i>Act a little shy
Aw, why?</i>

405
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:57,818
<i>Struggle just a little
Then hug a little</i>

406
00:25:57,898 --> 00:25:59,938
<i>And cuddle up and whisper this</i>

407
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,378
<i>Come on, I've been waiting long</i>

408
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:04,218
Wait a minute. Hold it.

409
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:07,858
Hold it, girls. Gordon, listen, you've got
to put some life into that song.

410
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:09,498
- Yeah?
- You got to sing it with some pep...

411
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:12,018
and some feeling.
You got the whole thing wrong. Listen.

412
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:15,658
Play me the first chorus, will you?
Here's the way it goes. Now come on.

413
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:16,898
<i>Pettin'in the park</i>

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

428
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:41,938
What am I doing that's so wrong?

429
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,898
Well, listen, you do this
right in the middle part.

430
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:45,538
<i>Come on, I've been waiting</i>

431
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:47,218
That's not the melody. Here it is.

432
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:48,298
<i>Come on</i>

433
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:51,578
<i>I've been waiting long
Why don't we get started?</i>

434
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,578
All right. All right.

435
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:55,418
Now, let me tell you something.

436
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:57,338
I've been a juvenile for 18 years...

437
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:59,738
and you're going to tell me
how to sing a song?

438
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:02,578
Come on, fellows, let me down, will you?
I want to get a glass of water.

439
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:04,978
Come on, girls and boys,
show me that dance chorus.

440
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,378
Come on, snap into it. Hit it now.
Come on, let's go. Give it to me now.

441
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,978
Listen, Brad, why don't you do
this juvenile part yourself?

442
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:13,018
You've got it over Gordon like a tent.

443
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,098
Reconsider. Give your songs a break.

444
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:16,578
Barney, I told you, I can't do it.

445
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,058
You say you can't,
but you don't tell me why.

446
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:26,898
You've got a voice. You got personality.

447
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,178
You can do it, but you won't. Why?

448
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:33,218
Barney, will you let it go at that
once and for all? No public appearances.

449
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:38,738
- Hi, sweets.
- Hello.

450
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:45,738
Listen, honey, you've got quite a yen
for that boy, haven't you?

451
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:48,058
I like him, of course.

452
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:51,578
There's something awful funny about him,
something very mysterious.

453
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:53,818
Listen, did he ever tell you
where he got that $15,000?

454
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:55,418
- No.
- And why he has to live on $25 a week...

455
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,538
when he can go out and come back
with that much money?

456
00:27:57,618 --> 00:27:59,538
Now, look.
"Toronto bank clerk took $20,000...

457
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,538
- "from bank and disappeared."
- I can read.

458
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:05,738
That's quite a coincidence, I should say.

459
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,618
- What's a coincidence?
- And look.

460
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:10,018
"New York police asked to check up
Broadway nightspots."

461
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:13,218
And here's the description of him:
"5'9", dark hair"...

462
00:28:13,298 --> 00:28:14,378
That could describe anybody.

463
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,698
It couldn't describe me,
and it couldn't describe you...

464
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,658
and it does describe him.
He is about 5'9"...

465
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,338
and he has got dark hair,
and where did he get that cash?

466
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,098
Well, don't be ridiculous, Trixie.

467
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:24,938
You're letting your imagination
run away with you.

468
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:27,378
Listen, honey, I don't want to see
you fall in love with a guy...

469
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,018
who's going to get you
into a lot of trouble.

470
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,498
I know, but I'm sure.

471
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,498
What are you sure?
What do you actually know about him?

472
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,978
Does he ever talk about himself?
Does he ever mention his family?

473
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:37,738
You remember that he wouldn't give
Barney a check, it had to be cash?

474
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:40,338
And he won't go out there
and play Gordon's part. Why?

475
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,778
Because he's afraid that newspaper...

476
00:28:49,578 --> 00:28:52,338
Now, listen, don't talk,
and don't come back here. You promise?

477
00:28:52,418 --> 00:28:54,778
I said I wouldn't, didn't I? So long.

478
00:28:57,698 --> 00:29:00,298
Don't say anything to anyone,
will you, Trixie?

479
00:29:30,338 --> 00:29:31,778
On stage.

480
00:29:32,258 --> 00:29:33,818
Stage, lady. Come on.

481
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:35,018
On stage.

482
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:48,018
You know, this stuff is just as good
to rub with as it is to drink.

483
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:49,738
It penetrates.

484
00:29:49,818 --> 00:29:51,738
Show me the spot.

485
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:55,138
He's been rubbing me for an hour,
and he says, "Show me the spot."

486
00:29:56,298 --> 00:29:58,898
- What's this?
- It's his lumbago.

487
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:01,258
- Get up.
- I can't, I tell you. I can't.

488
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:03,298
You can't get up, can't you?

489
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:06,098
No, don't. Please don't.

490
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:08,378
Straighten up, you permanent juvenile.

491
00:30:08,938 --> 00:30:10,298
I can't, I tell you. I can't.

492
00:30:10,338 --> 00:30:12,898
You don't suppose you're going out there
and singing a love song...

493
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,338
with your back doubled up, do you?

494
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:17,098
What kind of a love song
do you think this is?

495
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:20,378
You've got to straighten up.
You've got to stop being a baby.

496
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,978
Mind over matter.

497
00:30:25,218 --> 00:30:26,698
I can't, I tell you.

498
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:29,818
I got a show.
I spent weeks and months getting a show.

499
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:32,738
I've worked. I've slaved. Opening night.

500
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:35,538
We open tonight, and he's got lumbago.

501
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:39,298
Go out and announce the show
is postponed. Give them their money back.

502
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:42,618
Tell them our juvenile man's
dying of old age.

503
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:46,778
Listen, kid, now it's up to you.
Now you've got to do it.

504
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:49,218
- You've got to go on in his place.
- I can't do that, Barney.

505
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:52,858
Why can't you do it? The curtain's
going up. The show is going on.

506
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:55,578
Your girl's in it. Your music's in it.
Your money's in it.

507
00:30:55,658 --> 00:30:57,138
You've got to go on and do it.

508
00:30:57,218 --> 00:30:59,418
- There's a reason why.
- There can't be any reason.

509
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,258
- All right.
- Well, what is your reason?

510
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:04,538
Now, listen, I don't care if you have
to go to jail after this performance...

511
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:06,618
you ought to forgot about yourself
and do this anyway.

512
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,618
Do you know what it means
if this show doesn't go on?

513
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:10,578
Do you know what it means
to the girls in this show?

514
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:11,898
Those poor kids who gave up jobs...

515
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:13,938
and will never be able
to find other ones, these times.

516
00:31:14,018 --> 00:31:15,458
Those kids
who've been living on nothing...

517
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:17,578
starving themselves the six weeks
we've been rehearsing...

518
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,458
hoping for this show to go on
and be a success?

519
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:22,258
Well, they're counting on you.
You can't let them down. You can't.

520
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,378
If you do, well,
God knows what'll happen to those kids.

521
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:29,018
They'll have to do things I wouldn't want
on my conscience, and it will be on yours.

522
00:31:29,058 --> 00:31:31,738
Now, you can go out and sing
Gordon's part, and put this show over.

523
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:34,698
And if you don't, well,
I don't care what your reason is.

524
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:36,658
She's right, Brad.

525
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,658
I hadn't thought about it in that way.

526
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:42,778
- Yes, of course. I'll do it.
- Great, kid. I knew you would.

527
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,898
Walter, get Gordon's dress suit.
Get him a dressing room.

528
00:31:44,978 --> 00:31:47,458
He's not on for seven minutes.
They won't have to hold the curtain.

529
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,138
- Right. Come on, kids, we've got to...
- Oh, boy.

530
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:53,818
Get him ready.

531
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:56,818
Gee, if anything happens to him now,
we're responsible.

532
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,658
There's more to that kid
than I thought there was.

533
00:31:58,738 --> 00:32:01,338
He has nerve. He's regular.
He belongs in the show business.

534
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,778
He's risking going to prison for us.

535
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:06,938
I like that kid. If he goes to prison for this,
I'll visit him there, I swear I will.

536
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:10,218
I want to see him and let him know
that I know what it means.

537
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,538
- Brad.
- Hello.

538
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:16,538
Put your ear close to the door.
I want to whisper something to you.

539
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:17,578
All right, honey.

540
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:20,018
Brad, it's wonderful of you
to take this chance tonight.

541
00:32:20,098 --> 00:32:23,378
- It's courageous.
- It's not courageous, exactly.

542
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:26,018
Say, but how do you know? Do you know?

543
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:28,178
But don't think about it, Brad.

544
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:31,258
Just think about, I love you.

545
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:33,698
And I always will,
no matter what happens.

546
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:35,938
Gee, that's swell, honey.

547
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:38,178
After tonight, you can tell me all about it.

548
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:41,018
I'll understand, and maybe I can help.

549
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:42,178
After tonight?

550
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:44,578
Hurry, Miss Parker. Hurry, Mr. Roberts.

551
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:49,018
- Wish us luck, sweetheart.
- I do. I wish us luck.

552
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:04,898
<i>Every night a body should relax</i>

553
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:07,178
<i>After all the wear and tear</i>

554
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:10,218
<i>Get that oxygen your body lacks</i>

555
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,138
<i>Get it in the open air</i>

556
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:15,978
<i>Go and find a little rendezvous</i>

557
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:18,618
<i>Underneath the starry skies</i>

558
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:22,658
<i>Take someone who's sweet along with you</i>

559
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:28,218
<i>For a little exercise</i>

560
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,778
<i>Pettin'in the park</i>

561
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:30,978
<i>Bad boy!</i>

562
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:33,778
<i>Pettin'in the dark
Bad girl!</i>

563
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:36,098
<i>First you pet a little
Let up a little</i>

564
00:33:36,338 --> 00:33:38,938
<i>Then you get a little kiss</i>

565
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,698
<i>Pettin' on the sly</i>

566
00:33:40,778 --> 00:33:41,778
<i>Oh, my!</i>

567
00:33:41,858 --> 00:33:44,378
<i>Act a little shy
Aw, why?</i>

568
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:47,418
<i>Struggle just a little
Then hug a little</i>

569
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,738
<i>And cuddle up and whisper this</i>

570
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:52,658
<i>Come on, I've been waiting long</i>

571
00:33:52,978 --> 00:33:55,338
<i>Why don't we get started?</i>

572
00:33:55,418 --> 00:33:58,458
<i>Come on, maybe this is wrong</i>

573
00:33:58,498 --> 00:33:59,938
<i>Well, gee, what of it?</i>

574
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:02,698
<i>We just love it
Pettin'in the park</i>

575
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:04,018
<i>Bad boy!</i>

576

<i>Pettin'in the dark
Bad girl!</i>

577
00:34:06,818 --> 00:34:08,058
<i>Whatcha doin', honey?</i>

578
00:34:08,098 --> 00:34:09,418
<i>I feel so funny</i>

579
00:34:09,538 --> 00:34:12,018
<i>I'm pettin'in the park with you</i>

600
00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:18,098
<i>Struggle just a little
Then hug a little</i>

601
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:20,338
<i>And cuddle up and whisper this</i>

602
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,258
<i>Come on, I've been waiting long</i>

603
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:25,458
<i>Why don't we get started?</i>

604
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:26,698
<i>- Come on
- Come on</i>

605
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,018
<i>Maybe this is wrong</i>

606
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:30,738
<i>But, gee, what of it?
We just love it</i>

607
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:33,418
<i>Pettin'in the park
Bad boy!</i>

608
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,898
<i>Pettin'in the dark
Bad girl!</i>

609
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:38,338
<i>Whatcha doin', honey?
I feel so funny</i>

610
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:40,418
<i>I'm pettin'in the park with you</i>

611
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:02,338
<i>Pettin'in the park
Bad boy!</i>

612
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:04,698
<i>Pettin'in the dark
Bad girl!</i>

613
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:06,978
<i>First you pet a little
Let up a little</i>

614
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,738
<i>And then you get a little kiss</i>

615
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,578
<i>Pettin' on the sly
Oh, my!</i>

616
00:37:11,658 --> 00:37:13,978
<i>Act a little shy
Aw, why?</i>

617
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:16,258
<i>Struggle just a little
Then hug a little</i>

618
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:18,458
<i>And cuddle up and whisper this</i>

619
00:37:18,538 --> 00:37:21,018
<i>Come on, I've been waiting long</i>

620
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:23,058
<i>Why don't we get started?</i>

621
00:37:23,138 --> 00:37:25,498
<i>Come on, maybe this is wrong</i>

622
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,858
<i>- But, gee, what of it?
- We all love it</i>

623
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:30,418
<i>Pettin'in the park
Bad boy!</i>

624
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,738
<i>Pettin'in the dark
Bad girl!</i>

625
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,058
<i>Whatcha doin', honey?
I feel so funny</i>

626
00:37:35,258 --> 00:37:38,338
<i>I'm pettin'in the park with you</i>

627
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:22,498
<i>Pettin'in the park
Bad boy!</i>

628
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:24,858
<i>Pettin'in the dark
Bad girl!</i>

629
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,138
<i>Pet a little
Let up a little</i>

630
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:29,818
<i>And then you get a little kiss</i>

631
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:31,938
<i>Pettin' on the sly
Oh, my!</i>

632
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:34,258
<i>Act a little shy
Aw, why?</i>

633
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,658
<i>Struggle a little
Then hug a little</i>

634
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:38,338
<i>And cuddle up and whisper this</i>

635
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:41,458
<i>Come on, I've been waiting long</i>

636
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:43,658
<i>Why don't we get started?</i>

637
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:47,418
<i>Maybe this is wrong
But, gee, what of it?</i>

638
00:39:47,538 --> 00:39:48,698
<i>We just love it</i>

639
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:51,098
<i>Pettin'in the park
Bad boy!</i>

640
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:53,538
<i>Pettin'in the dark
Bad girl!</i>

641
00:39:53,618 --> 00:39:56,418
<i>Whatcha doin', honey?
I feel so funny</i>

642
00:39:56,538 --> 00:39:59,658
<i>I'm pettin'in the park with you</i>

643
00:40:20,738 --> 00:40:21,778
Who is the boy?

644
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:23,898
Brad Roberts,
according to the announcements.

645
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:26,538
And the program says
he did most of the music, too.

646
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:27,538
Smart kid.

647
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:29,538
There's something familiar about him.
I've seen him.

648
00:40:29,618 --> 00:40:31,818
Not in the theater, either. Wait a minute.

649
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:34,898
- Let me have a nickel.
- Yeah.

650
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:36,258
I'm going to find out.

651
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,418
Listen.

652
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:51,978
Why, I can't believe it.

653
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:54,578
The description, and I knew
I'd seen him someplace before.

654
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:56,698
Let's go back
and get Barney to tell us the truth.

655
00:40:56,778 --> 00:40:59,418
What a front-page story that will make.
Come on back with me.

656
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:11,618
- Polly, look at this.
- What?

657
00:41:11,698 --> 00:41:13,138
Look at it.

658
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,898
Oh, gosh.

659
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:17,178
I can't believe it.

660
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,378
I never dreamed of such a thing.

661
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:25,778
I always knew that kid was somebody.
You can't fool me much.

662
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,058
Why, Trixie Lorraine, you thought I was
a fool to have anything to do with this.

663
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,058
You don't know when I'm kidding, do you?

664
00:41:34,938 --> 00:41:37,178
- Mr. Bradford?
- He's over there on the lounge, sir.

665
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:38,298
Thank you.

666
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:41,698
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Robert.

667
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:43,218
- You're late.
- Not much, am I?

668
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:44,418
Seventeen minutes.

669
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:45,978
- Hello, Peabody.
- How are you, young man?

670
00:41:46,058 --> 00:41:47,298
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

671
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,618
I'll come directly to the point, Robert.

672
00:41:49,698 --> 00:41:52,338
Your family is greatly disturbed
over what has occurred.

673
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:54,938
I hope you appreciate the fact
that I flew here this morning...

674
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:56,378
in uncertain weather.

675
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:58,898
As trustee of your estate
and your elder brother...

676
00:41:58,978 --> 00:42:00,218
I represent the family...

677
00:42:00,258 --> 00:42:03,298
in saying that we cannot have you
mixed up in this theater business.

678
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,978
- You know how we feel.
- Your mother is greatly concerned...

679
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:07,658
and every member of your family.

680
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:11,138
I cannot begin to describe to you,
my dear boy, the extent of the shock.

681
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:13,738
I'm sorry
everybody in the family is shocked...

682
00:42:13,818 --> 00:42:15,658
but I'd better come
directly to the point, too.

683
00:42:15,738 --> 00:42:17,218
Music is my career, you know that.

684
00:42:17,298 --> 00:42:19,178
- Music, yes...
- Well, I mean the kind of songs...

685
00:42:19,258 --> 00:42:21,538
that's sung in shows,
and over the radio, and on record.

686
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:24,298
I don't mean the kind of music played
by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

687
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,858
You have to be half dead to compose that.

688
00:42:25,938 --> 00:42:29,018
I want to write this other kind of music.
This show was my big opportunity.

689
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:32,018
The show clicked.
I've got my start, and I'm going on with it.

690
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:34,458
As to appearing with the show,
I know how you feel about that.

691
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,178
And I did the best I could to stay out of it.

692
00:42:36,258 --> 00:42:38,178
But an emergency came up,
and I had to do it.

693
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:39,978
Now I can't let them down.

694
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,578
Besides, I like it.

695
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:44,258
Much as the family regrets
that one who bears our name...

696
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:47,098
should go in
for this sort of sensational career...

697
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:48,818
in preference to banking...

698
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:51,218
nevertheless, we've agreed
not to oppose you.

699
00:42:51,298 --> 00:42:53,898
One thing, however,
we must and will insist upon.

700
00:42:53,978 --> 00:42:55,698
And what's that?

701
00:42:55,778 --> 00:42:59,378
This girl, this showgirl
whose name is linked with yours...

702
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,258
- Polly Parker.
- Well, what of it?

703
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:03,658
- What of it? Simply this...
- Listen.

704
00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:05,818
Before you say anything about her,
you better know this.

705
00:43:05,898 --> 00:43:08,218
I'm in love with Polly Parker,
and I'm going to marry her.

706
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:09,978
- Lf she'll have me.
- What?

707
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:12,178
I'm going to complain
to the House Committee.

708
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:13,818
Just what I said.

709
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:17,138
- You'll marry this cheap little showgirl...
- Wait a minute.

710
00:43:17,218 --> 00:43:19,218
That's pretty much
of an old-fashioned idea.

711
00:43:19,298 --> 00:43:21,898
Families don't interfere
with love affairs nowadays.

712
00:43:21,978 --> 00:43:24,138
And if they do, it doesn't mean anything.

713
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:26,978
If you marry that girl,
you'll get not one cent of income.

714
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,378
I don't have to remind you
that until you're 30...

715
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:31,578
I have the absolute legal right
to cut off your income.

716
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:33,938
I understand,
and if that's all you have to say to me...

717
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:37,138
you're just wasting your time.
I've got more important things to do.

718
00:43:37,898 --> 00:43:40,818
I shall certainly complain
to the House Committee.

719
00:43:41,658 --> 00:43:44,178
- I can't understand him.
- It's the girl.

720
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:47,858
I know these showgirls. They're just
little parasites, little gold diggers.

721
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:50,938
- I don't doubt it.
- I remember, in my early youth...

722
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:53,498
I trod the primrose path
on the Great White Way.

723
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:56,978
There I learned the bitter truth
that all women of the theater...

724
00:43:57,058 --> 00:43:59,458
were chisellers, parasites.

725
00:43:59,538 --> 00:44:01,338
Or as we call them, gold diggers.

726
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:02,498
I remember...

727
00:44:02,578 --> 00:44:05,698
well, one experience I had
with a woman of the theater.

728
00:44:06,698 --> 00:44:09,178
It was the day of the big Harvard game.

729
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:10,698
We all came down.

730
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:14,978
A stout company of young blades
eager to learn about life.

731
00:44:15,658 --> 00:44:19,138
I met this girl at the stage door
of the old casino.

732
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,658
We went to Rector's for a bite.

733
00:44:21,738 --> 00:44:23,338
I had a cold bird and a bottle.

734
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:25,338
She nibbled at a steak.

735
00:44:25,738 --> 00:44:27,698
Her name was Eunice.

736
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:31,258
She called me Fuffy.

737
00:44:31,658 --> 00:44:34,778
I don't know why she did,
but she called me Fuffy.

738
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,698
I'm going to see her.

739
00:44:36,778 --> 00:44:39,098
I don't know where she is now.
That was 30 years ago.

740
00:44:39,138 --> 00:44:41,018
No, I mean this Polly Parker woman.

741
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:42,458
I wouldn't go if I were for you.

742
00:44:42,538 --> 00:44:44,298
You're only putting yourself
into their hands.

743
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:47,978
I tell you, they're all blackmailers,
gold diggers, parasites.

744
00:44:48,098 --> 00:44:49,738
I resign.

745
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:51,618
- No.
- Yes.

746
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:55,818
<i>When I feel a thing</i>

747
00:44:55,938 --> 00:44:58,338
<i>That I can sing</i>

748
00:44:58,418 --> 00:45:01,738
<i>It must be real</i>

749
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:04,338
<i>I couldn't sing a gay song</i>

750
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:06,778
<i>It wouldn't be sincere</i>

751
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:10,378
<i>I could never croon a happy tune</i>

752
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:14,338
- Come in.
- Hey, shut the bathroom door.

753
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:16,218
I will, Trixie.

754
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:19,098
<i>Without a tear
I have my dreams</i>

755
00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:20,978
Come in, come in.

756
00:45:22,378 --> 00:45:25,058
<i>They vanish in the sky</i>

757
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:28,378
<i>I try to smile and face the sun</i>

758
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:32,218
<i>But romance passes by</i>

759
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:37,858
Well, who is it?

760
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:39,898
I am J. Lawrence Bradford.

761
00:45:42,218 --> 00:45:43,258
Yes?

762
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:46,338
I've come to see Miss Polly Parker.

763
00:45:46,418 --> 00:45:47,538
Oh, yes?

764
00:45:47,618 --> 00:45:49,898
I'm the brother of Robert Treat Bradford...

765
00:45:49,978 --> 00:45:52,338
whom you probably know as Brad Roberts.

766
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:54,458
You're Brad's brother.

767
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:57,458
- Sit down, I'll be dressed in just a minute.
- Don't bother, Miss Parker.

768
00:45:57,538 --> 00:45:59,818
- I can say what I have to say...
- But you see, I'm not...

769
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:01,378
Please, Miss Parker.

770
00:46:02,058 --> 00:46:03,538
I've just spoken to my brother.

771
00:46:03,858 --> 00:46:06,098
He tells me he wants to marry you.

772
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:07,378
You're making a mistake.

773
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:09,818
- Lf you'll let me explain...
- Don't bother to explain.

774
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:13,338
I've told him if he disgraces the family
by marrying a showgirl...

775
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:15,098
the family is through with him.

776
00:46:15,178 --> 00:46:17,978
Did you say, "Disgrace the family
by marrying a showgirl"?

777
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:21,698
I said exactly that.
Showgirls are reputed to be...

778
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:25,218
parasites, chisellers, gold diggers.

779
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:27,698
Showgirls are excellent in their way...

780
00:46:27,778 --> 00:46:30,618
attractive creatures, even fascinating...

781
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:33,738
but hardly fitted to shine
in the upper social circles.

782
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,138
This is not directed
against you personally, Miss Parker.

783
00:46:36,218 --> 00:46:38,298
No, I understand that, not personally.

784
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:41,178
All showgirls are parasites,
chisellers, and gold diggers.

785
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,098
Exactly.

786
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:44,698
- And now...
- You better let me tell you...

787
00:46:44,778 --> 00:46:46,778
Just tell me how much?

788
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,138
- How much what?
- What is your price?

789
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:52,738
How much do you want to release his
brother from his promise to marry you?

790
00:46:52,898 --> 00:46:56,698
- Well, this is very funny.
- I see nothing amusing in it, Miss Parker.

791
00:46:57,378 --> 00:46:59,378
Please, don't let's waste time. How much?

792
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,298
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

793
00:47:01,378 --> 00:47:02,858
No price on me.

794
00:47:02,938 --> 00:47:05,378
But I insist, Miss Parker.
You must have a price.

795
00:47:05,578 --> 00:47:07,898
I'm inclined to be generous in the matter.

796
00:47:08,538 --> 00:47:11,538
After all, I realize
that Bob is a headstrong boy.

797
00:47:11,738 --> 00:47:14,898
But I'm in charge of him,
and I feel I know what is best for him.

798
00:47:15,778 --> 00:47:18,138
I've had about enough of this.

799
00:47:20,698 --> 00:47:22,098
If you don't mind...

800
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:27,098
I beg your pardon, but am I interrupting?

801
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,818
No, not at all.

802
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:31,978
This is Brad's brother,
J. Lawrence Bradford.

803
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,738
I'm charmed.

804
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:36,098
Beware, Trixie's a showgirl.

805
00:47:36,178 --> 00:47:38,578
Who is this distinguished looking
young man?

806
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:41,338
- I don't know.
- I'm Faneuil H. Peabody.

807
00:47:41,578 --> 00:47:43,698
- Faneuil?
- Faneuil.

808
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:46,258
When I know you better,
I'll call you Fanny.

809
00:47:46,338 --> 00:47:47,818
Have you got a cigarette?

810
00:47:52,738 --> 00:47:53,938
Gold.

811
00:47:56,058 --> 00:47:58,178
My error. Have you a light?

812
00:48:02,938 --> 00:48:04,578
Your hand is shaking.

813
00:48:05,778 --> 00:48:07,858
What an unexpected pleasure.

814
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:10,618
Now, come along,
let's sit over on the other side of the room.

815
00:48:10,698 --> 00:48:12,458
Come on. Come along.

816
00:48:12,618 --> 00:48:16,218
You know, I used to know some Peabodys,
but I think they came from Texas.

817
00:48:16,258 --> 00:48:19,578
Sit down, now. Come on, sit down.

818
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:21,218
There.

819
00:48:21,418 --> 00:48:25,018
Mr. J. Lawrence Bradford
tells me I must give Brad up.

820
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:28,778
He also says we're chisellers and
gold diggers, and wants to know my price.

821
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:30,938
Well, have you told him, Polly?

822
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,538
I was about to tell him where to head in.

823
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,338
I wouldn't be too hasty.

824
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:37,778
I'd at least discuss it further.

825
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:40,338
After all, we're grown up, sensible.

826
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,658
You're a woman of the world.
I'm a man of the world.

827
00:48:42,738 --> 00:48:44,458
We ought to have a conference.

828
00:48:44,618 --> 00:48:47,498
Isn't that what businessmen always have
when they're away from home?

829
00:48:47,578 --> 00:48:48,778
Conferences?

830
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:51,258
I know a new speaky. It just opened.

831
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:53,338
Their liquor is good,
and do I know good liquor.

832
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:56,298
It's right around the corner,
and we'll be with you in just two minutes.

833
00:48:56,378 --> 00:48:57,858
I'll just slip into something.

834
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,018
I beg your pardon.

835
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:01,498
- What's that?
- My slip.

836
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:04,418
Come along, Polly, dear.
Let's not keep them waiting.

837
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:09,698
Here's something for you to read...

838
00:49:09,778 --> 00:49:11,818
Mr. Bradford.

839
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:13,018
And...

840
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:16,538
here are some pictures for you to look at.

841
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,178
Now, you amuse yourselves, won't you?
We'll just be two minutes.

842
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:22,458
Fanny.

843
00:49:29,978 --> 00:49:31,498
Peabody, you're disgusting.

844
00:49:32,778 --> 00:49:34,458
I'm going to tell them the truth
and kick them out.

845
00:49:34,498 --> 00:49:36,258
After what he called you? A parasite?

846
00:49:36,338 --> 00:49:38,538
Say, what is a parasite?
You better resent it.

847
00:49:39,098 --> 00:49:40,618
He did get under my skin.

848
00:49:40,738 --> 00:49:41,818
Stuck-up snob.

849
00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:43,538
They've had their turn. Let's have ours.

850
00:49:43,618 --> 00:49:45,018
We'll take them for a ride.

851
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:46,778
Use the bathroom while I use the phone.

852
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,738
Endicott 2.

853
00:49:53,018 --> 00:49:54,378
Hello, Madam Minnie?

854
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:56,298
This is Trixie Lorraine.

855
00:49:56,898 --> 00:49:59,098
Say, you know the hat with the...

856
00:49:59,258 --> 00:50:00,178
Yeah.

857
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:01,378
No, no.

858
00:50:02,218 --> 00:50:04,418
The expensive one.

859
00:50:25,738 --> 00:50:27,538
Did the buzzer buzz?

860
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:32,458
What's that?

861
00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:34,458
A COD for Miss Polly Parker.

862
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:35,898
$75.

863
00:50:35,938 --> 00:50:38,778
$75 just for a little hat?

864
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:45,218
But she'll look adorable in that, won't she?

865
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:47,578
Yes, she will.

866
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,458
Now let me see. What does COD mean?

867
00:50:51,618 --> 00:50:53,738
That means you've got to pay for it.

868
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:56,698
How inconvenient.

869
00:50:57,018 --> 00:50:58,818
Well, you'll have to take it back.

870
00:50:59,138 --> 00:51:01,498
Oh, dear. She'll be in such a bad mood.

871
00:51:01,698 --> 00:51:03,658
- Who will?
- Polly.

872
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:07,258
She did so want to wear that hat when
she went out for lunch with you today.

873
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:10,858
Oh, dear. When she doesn't get
what she wants, you just don't know Polly.

874
00:51:10,978 --> 00:51:13,178
Oh, so disagreeable. She's no fun at all.

875
00:51:13,218 --> 00:51:14,338
Just sits there.

876
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:16,538
She won't agree to anything you say.

877
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:19,058
She probably won't even want
to go with us.

878
00:51:19,138 --> 00:51:21,258
We three will just have to go alone.

879
00:51:23,298 --> 00:51:26,058
There you are, boy. Take it back.

880
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:28,218
Here, wait a minute.

881
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:31,138
- How much is it?
- $75.

882
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:34,698
$75 for a hat?

883
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:36,898
Sure, that's what the ticket calls for.

884
00:51:41,538 --> 00:51:42,458
Here.

885
00:51:43,698 --> 00:51:45,858
- Leave the hat.
- You darling man.

886
00:51:45,938 --> 00:51:48,818
Polly's just going to love you for this.

887
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:54,898
Polly, this sweet big brother of Brad's...

888
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,938
has insisted upon paying for your hat.

889
00:51:57,018 --> 00:51:59,258
- But he mustn't do that.
- But he has.

890
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:01,178
- But I couldn't.
- But you must.

891
00:52:03,618 --> 00:52:06,258
That looks adorable on her, doesn't it?

892
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,858
Doesn't it?

893
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:11,058
Yes, now all you need is a corsage.

894
00:52:11,138 --> 00:52:13,698
I think lilies of the valley and gardenias.

895
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:15,338
I guess I'll need orchids.

896
00:52:15,418 --> 00:52:17,018
- Shall we send out for some?
- Yes.

897
00:52:17,058 --> 00:52:19,898
Let's be going.
I must get a 4:00 train to Boston.

898
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:22,498
I'm very sorry, Mr. Bradford.

899
00:52:22,578 --> 00:52:24,738
But I just couldn't leave the room
without a corsage.

900
00:52:24,818 --> 00:52:27,458
And I wouldn't let Polly.
I couldn't let her go out that way.

901
00:52:27,618 --> 00:52:30,058
We'll buy you a corsage on the way.

902
00:52:30,418 --> 00:52:33,178
- But let's hurry.
- Isn't he a darling?

903
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:35,738
You're just so generous.

904
00:52:38,138 --> 00:52:40,258
Polly, I wonder if you would answer that.

905
00:52:40,338 --> 00:52:41,778
I'm going to powder my nose.

906
00:52:45,618 --> 00:52:46,578
Well, what's this?

907
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:49,338
Looks like another hat.

908
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:51,178
We have a hat, my lad.

909
00:52:51,258 --> 00:52:53,618
- But I was...
- You must have the wrong address.

910
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:54,698
Oh, no.

911
00:52:54,858 --> 00:52:57,578
- Who's the hat for?
- A Miss Trixie Lorraine.

912
00:52:57,658 --> 00:53:00,898
It's for Trixie. Let me see it.

913
00:53:02,618 --> 00:53:05,338
Look, isn't this ducky? Look.

914
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:11,258
- How much?
- It's somewhere...

915
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:12,458
Let me see the bill.

916
00:53:12,538 --> 00:53:14,258
Bill. Yes, sir.

917
00:53:16,898 --> 00:53:18,378
$75.

918
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,258
Do all hats cost $75?

919
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:23,298
Now, you dear, sweet man. You are not
going to pay for that. You're not.

920
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:25,698
Trixie. Come on in, Trixie.

921
00:53:26,018 --> 00:53:29,578
I'm very much afraid I haven't the change.

922
00:53:29,658 --> 00:53:31,258
- How much do you need?
- $5.

923
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:33,738
You just keep that. Buy yourself a yacht.

924
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:36,658
But I get so seasick.

925
00:53:38,178 --> 00:53:39,138
Well, thanks.

926
00:53:39,778 --> 00:53:42,698
- Trixie.
- Did you call me, Polly?

927
00:53:42,778 --> 00:53:45,298
Isn't this darling?
Handsome bought it for you.

928
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:49,218
You sweet lamb.

929
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:51,578
He shouldn't have paid for it.

930
00:53:52,538 --> 00:53:54,818
Oh, dear. Now he'll think I'm extravagant.

931
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:59,098
But what a pretty hat.

932
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:01,618
You do like me in it, don't you?

933
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,218
You know, I think we ought to take a stroll
on Fifth Avenue and look at the shops.

934
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:08,018
You'd be surprised
how reasonable things are these days.

935
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:09,338
Come on, J. Lawrence.

936
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:24,258
I'm a busy man, Miss Parker.

937
00:54:24,338 --> 00:54:27,618
I cannot afford to waste more time
in coming to an understanding with you.

938
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,978
I've been wanting to ask you a question.

939
00:54:30,578 --> 00:54:32,418
Are your eyes hazel?

940
00:54:32,698 --> 00:54:34,338
My eyes?

941
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,498
- Please, Miss Parker.
- They are hazel.

942
00:54:37,698 --> 00:54:39,418
And such nice eyes.

943
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:42,058
Such a good, kind expression.

944
00:54:43,098 --> 00:54:45,978
- Miss Parker, please.
- Now don't be so formal.

945
00:54:46,178 --> 00:54:48,298
Didn't you promise to call me Polly?

946
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:50,978
- Polly.
- Thanks.

947
00:55:00,098 --> 00:55:04,818
- I beg your pardon.
- That's all right, Fannykins.

948
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:07,218
I've got to have another cigarette.

949
00:55:07,618 --> 00:55:08,978
Platinum.

950
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,138
Hello, everybody.

951
00:55:17,218 --> 00:55:19,938
Get her. Just when I was
beginning to have a good time.

952
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,258
Introduce me, won't you?

953
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:23,578
I thought you'd left.

954
00:55:23,618 --> 00:55:25,498
- Miss Fortune, Mr. Bradford.
- How do you do?

955
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:27,618
- Charmed.
- You didn't introduce me.

956
00:55:27,778 --> 00:55:29,778
Miss Fortune, this is Mr. Peabody.

957
00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:33,218
- Mr. Peabody.
- Miss Fortune.

958
00:55:33,378 --> 00:55:34,898
My good fortune.

959
00:55:35,058 --> 00:55:37,738
My good man,
are you by any chance punning?

960
00:55:38,018 --> 00:55:39,658
I'm quite a punster.

961
00:55:39,738 --> 00:55:42,778
I get it. I suppose you were a stroke
on your college punsing team.

962
00:55:43,618 --> 00:55:45,978
That's funny. That's very funny.

963
00:55:46,018 --> 00:55:48,058
Miss Fortune, won't you join us?

964
00:55:48,138 --> 00:55:49,898
I'd love to. I'm just in the mood.

965
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:52,738
- Some champagne?
- Indeed, my doctor recommends it.

966
00:55:54,498 --> 00:55:56,698
- Did you have a mother?
- What?

967
00:55:56,738 --> 00:55:58,338
Whose name was Eunice?

968
00:55:58,818 --> 00:56:00,578
No, I don't think so.

969
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,618
I did have a mother.

970
00:56:02,658 --> 00:56:04,178
Whose name was Gertrude.

971
00:56:04,258 --> 00:56:07,458
- You look like Eunice.
- You do look like Eunice.

972
00:56:08,778 --> 00:56:09,818
What's the matter?

973
00:56:09,858 --> 00:56:12,538
Fay has an attack of chiseling.
It's chronic with her.

974
00:56:12,698 --> 00:56:15,498
Another look at him with those
bedroom eyes and I'll break your leg.

975
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:19,138
Excuse me for whispering.
Fay and I have so much in common.

976
00:56:19,538 --> 00:56:21,858
Can we have some more champagne?

977
00:56:21,898 --> 00:56:22,858
A quart.

978
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:39,298
Now I tell you,
there's only one thing to do.

979
00:56:39,418 --> 00:56:41,058
We've got to spend more time here.

980
00:56:41,138 --> 00:56:42,738
We've got to see more of her.

981
00:56:42,818 --> 00:56:44,698
I don't wish to see any more of her.

982
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,898
What I've seen convinces me.

983
00:56:48,218 --> 00:56:51,378
We absolutely must make her think
we're an easy proposition.

984
00:56:51,698 --> 00:56:54,858
- Suckers, you might say.
- What are you shaking your head for?

985
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,618
I'm thinking of the consequences.

986
00:56:58,298 --> 00:56:59,338
I believe...

987
00:56:59,418 --> 00:57:02,658
I can make this girl transfer her affection
from him to me.

988
00:57:03,138 --> 00:57:06,018
- What?
- Don't misunderstand me.

989
00:57:06,618 --> 00:57:08,338
Nothing personal in it.

990
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,338
This girl is smart.

991
00:57:11,498 --> 00:57:13,778
Now what are you shaking your head for?

992
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:15,698
Are you afraid?

993
00:57:16,218 --> 00:57:19,738
- Afraid of what?
- Well, I confess I'm a little afraid.

994
00:57:22,618 --> 00:57:24,738
That girl is very fascinating.

995
00:57:25,498 --> 00:57:27,098
But we're not boys, are we?

996
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:30,458
- Well, hardly.
- We're men, aren't we?

997
00:57:30,938 --> 00:57:33,618
And we needn't succumb
to that sort of feminine allure.

998
00:57:33,698 --> 00:57:35,738
- Need we?
- Indeed, we needn't.

999
00:57:35,898 --> 00:57:38,178
- Need we?
- Just because they want something...

1000
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:41,058
we don't have to give in, do we?

1001
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:42,858
No. Not at all.

1002
00:57:43,218 --> 00:57:46,258
- Let me have a light, please.
- A light? Certainly.

1003
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:49,858
A light?

1004
00:57:50,618 --> 00:57:51,698
Yes.

1005
00:57:57,498 --> 00:57:59,418
Where's your lighter?

1006
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:02,378
My lighter?

1007
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,178
Where'd you get the lighter?

1008
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:13,458
Fanny gave it to me.

1009
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:16,458
Fanny? This is marvelous.
This is wonderful.

1010
00:58:16,578 --> 00:58:17,498
Who's Fanny?

1011
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,138
Fanny is Faneuil H. Peabody.

1012
00:58:19,218 --> 00:58:22,178
The kind of man I've been looking for,
lots of money and no resistance.

1013
00:58:22,258 --> 00:58:25,218
Old Peabody's the family lawyer.
This is great.

1014
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:26,978
Well, I don't think it's so funny.

1015
00:58:27,138 --> 00:58:29,058
We must tell Brad's brother the truth.

1016
00:58:29,178 --> 00:58:30,378
The truth about what?

1017
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:32,618
The truth about Carol not being me.

1018
00:58:32,778 --> 00:58:34,458
No, you've got to go on with it.

1019
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:36,978
He thinks he's pretty darn smart.
Take him for a ride.

1020
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:39,498
You said it. Let's go on playing this game.

1021
00:58:39,578 --> 00:58:40,898
Gee, it's for prizes.

1022
00:58:40,978 --> 00:58:43,978
Look what I got already:
Gold, platinum, animals.

1023
00:58:44,538 --> 00:58:48,058
That's nothing compared to
what I'm going to get out of Fanny.

1024
00:58:48,578 --> 00:58:50,258
Well, I don't think it's right.

1025
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:52,978
- It's going to cause Brad more trouble.
- Hey, listen.

1026
00:58:53,058 --> 00:58:55,658
I could do something that'd make him
come to Polly on his knees...

1027
00:58:55,738 --> 00:58:57,058
and beg her to marry Brad.

1028
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:58,858
- I've got an idea.
- That's right, honey.

1029
00:58:58,938 --> 00:59:00,378
"Use well before shaking."

1030
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:02,538
We're going to have
a lot of unnecessary trouble.

1031
00:59:02,618 --> 00:59:05,298
But I'd marry Polly
with or without his consent.

1032
00:59:05,378 --> 00:59:08,818
- I want to get even with him.
- I want a chauffeur with a car.

1033
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:11,738
I want a chauffeur
with buttons and a uniform.

1034
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:13,978
And I want a dog.

1035
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:18,058
I want a dog named Fanny.

1036
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:22,658
Buy the little doggie for Trixie.

1037
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:24,378
What do you want the beast for?

1038
00:59:24,418 --> 00:59:26,458
Then I'll have something
to remember you by.

1039
00:59:26,538 --> 00:59:28,578
What name do you wish to engrave
on the collar, madam?

1040
00:59:28,658 --> 00:59:29,618
Fanny.

1041
00:59:30,178 --> 00:59:32,858
It's not that kind of a dog.

1042
00:59:33,058 --> 00:59:35,538
His name is Fanny. It's a pet name.

1043
00:59:37,378 --> 00:59:40,538
Every time I look at my dog,
I'll think of you.

1044
00:59:40,738 --> 00:59:42,418
Then I'll have two little Fannys.

1045
00:59:42,498 --> 00:59:44,218
Here, hold him while I powder my nose.

1046
01:00:21,858 --> 01:00:24,738
- Shall we dance?
- Certainly. Why not?

1047
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:27,058
I thought this was my dance.

1048
01:00:27,138 --> 01:00:30,098
Sorry, Bob. Why don't you dance
with this nice young lady?

1049
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:32,538
Thanks. I'll dance with whom I please.

1050
01:00:35,818 --> 01:00:38,698
- Shall we indulge?
- Why sure, what can I lose?

1051
01:00:41,778 --> 01:00:43,778
My brother's jealous.

1052
01:00:43,938 --> 01:00:45,978
He has no reason to be.

1053
01:00:46,258 --> 01:00:48,418
I am not prepared to say that.

1054
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,338
Well, then, I'll say it for you.

1055
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:54,058
You're as light as a heifer, a feather.

1056
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:56,658
You know...

1057
01:00:59,418 --> 01:01:02,578
I'm much more
the sort of man for you, Polly.

1058
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:05,658
Yes, you have your good points.

1059
01:01:07,778 --> 01:01:08,818
Let's dance, honey.

1060
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,258
Don't look at me that way.
He may see you.

1061
01:01:14,738 --> 01:01:17,258
Am I registering jealousy or am I not?

1062
01:01:17,738 --> 01:01:19,298
No, you're wonderful.

1063
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,418
Watch it. Look jealous. Here they come.

1064
01:01:29,658 --> 01:01:31,378
Come on, honey. Let's dance.

1065
01:01:31,698 --> 01:01:34,378
I bet you think it's bolder,
dancing this way.

1066
01:01:34,658 --> 01:01:36,978
I think it's delightful.

1067
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:45,498
- I'm a clumsy soul.
- You're a dear.

1068
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:47,738
- I'm getting old.
- Aren't we all?

1069
01:01:47,778 --> 01:01:49,818
Say, I'm a little bit old myself.

1070
01:01:49,898 --> 01:01:53,898
You, old? Why,
you're the very personification of youth.

1071
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:57,498
Thanks, but honest,
I don't know what's the matter with me.

1072
01:01:57,538 --> 01:02:00,738
I have a yen for a little house
in the country...

1073
01:02:00,938 --> 01:02:02,218
and the fireside...

1074
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:05,058
and carpet slippers for the old man.

1075
01:02:05,218 --> 01:02:06,498
Who's the old man?

1076
01:02:06,578 --> 01:02:09,658
You'd run if I told you.

1077
01:02:09,738 --> 01:02:12,658
I couldn't run very far. I'm very fat.

1078
01:02:12,738 --> 01:02:15,138
Say, can you imagine me
getting sentimental?

1079
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:18,058
The most hard boiled dame
on the Dirty White Way.

1080
01:02:18,178 --> 01:02:21,378
You're not hard boiled.
That's just on the surface.

1081
01:02:21,498 --> 01:02:22,578
Underneath, you're...

1082
01:02:22,658 --> 01:02:25,498
Say, what do you know
about me underneath?

1083
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:26,538
I mean...

1084
01:02:26,738 --> 01:02:28,858
I know what you mean, you old sugar.

1085
01:02:28,898 --> 01:02:31,298
You watch out. I'm falling in love with you.

1086
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:36,258
Hello, boy. When love comes at my age...

1087
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:37,698
Guess who?

1088
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:40,378
- It's little Fay.
- Yes.

1089
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:42,218
It's little phooey.

1090
01:02:42,818 --> 01:02:46,498
Fay, darling,
I have something to show you.

1091
01:02:46,618 --> 01:02:48,738
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Surely.

1092
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:51,738
- Can you see that?
- See what?

1093
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:53,538
Can you read where it says exit?

1094
01:02:53,618 --> 01:02:54,938
- Exit.
- You said it.

1095
01:02:54,978 --> 01:02:56,418
You start walking, and you keep walking.

1096
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:58,938
And if you ever come near him again,
I'll break both your legs.

1097
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:01,418
- I could easily resent that.
- Scram.

1098
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,418
Did little Fay cry out?

1099
01:03:03,578 --> 01:03:05,698
No, that must've been
the cornet you heard.

1100
01:03:17,058 --> 01:03:19,098
Pardon me, but I think this is my dance.

1101
01:03:19,138 --> 01:03:21,778
- I'm so sorry.
- Quite all right.

1102
01:03:48,578 --> 01:03:50,138
Beautiful, isn't it?

1103
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:52,578
Yes, beautiful.

1104
01:03:53,698 --> 01:03:57,338
You know,
I've been watching you and wondering...

1105
01:03:58,178 --> 01:04:01,538
You're so obviously a girl of breeding.

1106
01:04:03,138 --> 01:04:05,538
- Who are your people?
- My father?

1107
01:04:06,418 --> 01:04:09,658
My father was an official
in the government service.

1108
01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:11,498
Her father was a letter carrier.

1109
01:04:11,618 --> 01:04:14,578
Mother was an invalid.

1110
01:04:14,978 --> 01:04:16,858
Her mother could have
licked John L. Sullivan.

1111
01:04:17,018 --> 01:04:19,378
Then how did it happen?

1112
01:04:20,258 --> 01:04:22,738
What are you doing in the theater?

1113
01:04:22,978 --> 01:04:25,498
Well, you see, it was like this.

1114
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:28,978
I was at finishing school...

1115
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,698
when my parents died.

1116
01:04:31,298 --> 01:04:33,978
- And they left me...
- An orphan.

1117
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:35,818
Yes, an orphan.

1118
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:39,578
I had to find something to do, earn money.

1119
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,298
And all I could find was...

1120
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:43,738
Well, you see?

1121
01:04:44,258 --> 01:04:45,818
I do see.

1122
01:04:47,058 --> 01:04:49,058
You're the sort of child who...

1123
01:04:49,138 --> 01:04:51,858
the sort of girl who...

1124
01:04:51,938 --> 01:04:55,258
Not cheap, not vulgar.

1125
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,778
Not at all like people in the theater.

1126
01:04:59,578 --> 01:05:04,338
You know, you are the girl
my brother should be interested in.

1127
01:05:06,618 --> 01:05:08,658
- Well, I don't like that.
- Neither do I.

1128
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,538
So we're all too vulgar
for J. Lawrence Bradford.

1129
01:05:11,618 --> 01:05:14,498
- No. Not at all.
- All except this nice little girl.

1130
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:17,618
- I'm too cheap and vulgar.
- No. I didn't mean that.

1131
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:20,738
I'm going home. I'm not going to stay
and be insulted like this.

1132
01:05:24,738 --> 01:05:25,658
Polly.

1133
01:05:27,178 --> 01:05:28,418
I'm getting lonesome.

1134
01:05:28,578 --> 01:05:31,658
Polly, you misunderstood me.
I think you're...

1135
01:05:31,738 --> 01:05:33,858
Here I am, honey.

1136
01:05:44,698 --> 01:05:47,138
I want to make you understand that...

1137
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,058
I wouldn't offend you
for anything in the world.

1138
01:05:50,138 --> 01:05:53,018
Let's forget it. How about another drink?

1139
01:06:04,258 --> 01:06:05,178
Here.

1140
01:06:05,618 --> 01:06:06,578
I'll forgive you.

1141
01:06:07,178 --> 01:06:08,138
Bottoms up.

1142
01:06:13,538 --> 01:06:14,818
I want to say...

1143
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:16,618
About you...

1144
01:06:17,498 --> 01:06:18,458
Like me?

1145
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:21,698
Like isn't the word.

1146
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:35,018
It goes deeper than that, Polly.

1147
01:06:41,978 --> 01:06:44,218
I don't understand it myself.

1148
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:48,978
- I love you, Polly.
- You're drunk.

1149
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,218
- No, I'm not...
- Yes, you are. You're drunk.

1150
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:55,538
I love you, Polly.

1151
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:06,098
You don't mean a word you're saying.
You're just playing, aren't you?

1152
01:07:06,258 --> 01:07:07,738
I am, you know.

1153
01:07:08,498 --> 01:07:09,858
Stop it.

1154
01:07:34,858 --> 01:07:36,458
Oh, you are drunk.

1155
01:07:40,658 --> 01:07:42,738
- Who is it?
- It's me, Trixie.

1156
01:07:47,098 --> 01:07:48,538
- Where's your key?
- Here it is.

1157
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:50,938
I can't manage it,
my fingers are frostbitten.

1158
01:07:50,978 --> 01:07:54,658
- Where'd you leave Fanny?
- I left Fanny behind. He's waiting.

1159
01:07:55,298 --> 01:07:58,018
Well, what's the matter with him,
sleeping sickness?

1160
01:07:58,098 --> 01:07:59,258
He passed out.

1161
01:07:59,298 --> 01:08:02,618
Well, he doesn't have to pass out
all over our lounge.

1162
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:10,618
- Say.
- Say what?

1163
01:08:11,538 --> 01:08:14,098
Have I an idea? Ask me, "Have I an idea?"

1164
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:16,218
- Have you an idea?
- Listen.

1165
01:08:16,418 --> 01:08:18,618
- We'll stick him into bed, your bed.
- Oh, no, you don't.

1166
01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:21,298
Don't get excited. You'll sleep with me.

1167
01:08:21,538 --> 01:08:23,258
Then, when he wakes up in the morning...

1168
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:24,898
will we have him where we want him?

1169
01:08:24,978 --> 01:08:26,698
Will he do just what we want him to do?

1170
01:08:26,778 --> 01:08:28,498
- Ask me, will he?
- I don't like it.

1171
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:30,178
You want to get even with him, don't you?

1172
01:08:30,258 --> 01:08:31,258
Yes, I do.

1173
01:08:31,338 --> 01:08:33,178
Can't you see,
when he wakes up in the morning...

1174
01:08:33,218 --> 01:08:35,578
what will he ask himself?
What would anyone ask himself?

1175
01:08:35,618 --> 01:08:37,058
"What has happened?" he will ask himself.

1176
01:08:37,098 --> 01:08:39,418
"What am I doing in this girl's bed?"
He will ask himself.

1177
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:42,658
And how many answers are there to that?
You tell me.

1178
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,458
Oh, but nothing will have happened.

1179
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:46,818
Of course not, nothing will have happened.

1180
01:08:46,898 --> 01:08:48,738
- You said it.
- But he'll think...

1181
01:08:48,778 --> 01:08:49,978
Say, you know what he'll feel like?

1182
01:08:50,018 --> 01:08:52,418
He'll feel like, what do they call them?
Oh, yes, a cad.

1183
01:08:52,498 --> 01:08:54,538
- It's a bet. I'll do it.
- You take his head.

1184
01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:56,058
No. You take his head, I'll take his feet.

1185
01:08:56,138 --> 01:08:57,338
I don't want to look at him anymore.

1186
01:08:57,418 --> 01:09:00,738
Say, you know, I thought you were
getting kind of stuck on him.

1187
01:09:00,818 --> 01:09:03,498
Don't be stupid, Trixie.
I was just putting on a good act.

1188
01:09:03,578 --> 01:09:06,138
A very good act. You certainly fooled me.

1189
01:09:06,218 --> 01:09:08,738
Okay, dearie, here you go to bed.

1190
01:09:11,258 --> 01:09:14,378
There, now, my little man.

1191
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:16,818
If you think I've fallen
for that apple-cheeked boyfriend...

1192
01:09:16,898 --> 01:09:18,218
I've been chiseling.

1193
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:21,498
Say, you'd be surprised
what plans I have for him.

1194
01:09:21,778 --> 01:09:23,938
And will he be surprised.

1195
01:09:24,218 --> 01:09:27,138
Say, I'm going to take him
like Graham took Waterloo...

1196
01:09:27,218 --> 01:09:28,738
or whatever he took.

1197
01:09:28,818 --> 01:09:30,738
<i>And when he</i>

1198
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:33,258
<i>Wakes up in the morning</i>

1199
01:09:33,338 --> 01:09:36,098
<i>When he wakes up in the</i>

1200
01:09:36,818 --> 01:09:38,058
What's this?

1201
01:09:38,138 --> 01:09:40,338
- It can't be. It isn't.
- It is.

1202
01:09:40,418 --> 01:09:43,218
- How did he get there?
- He passed out, so we tucked him in.

1203
01:09:43,298 --> 01:09:45,338
This is wonderful. This is marvelous.

1204
01:09:45,378 --> 01:09:47,858
- I'm afraid we've gone too far.
- Gone too far?

1205
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:50,178
- Yes.
- No, this is only the beginning.

1206
01:09:50,258 --> 01:09:52,218
I have to run.
I've something important to attend to.

1207
01:09:52,258 --> 01:09:54,178
I'll be back in an hour.

1208
01:09:54,978 --> 01:09:58,658
So, my dear brother,
you'll cut off my income, will you?

1209
01:09:59,298 --> 01:10:01,698
Won't let me marry Polly, will you?

1210
01:10:01,738 --> 01:10:04,298
Well, listen, old fellow,
you don't know it yet...

1211
01:10:04,378 --> 01:10:07,498
but you're going to wake up
a kinder and a wiser man.

1212
01:11:06,378 --> 01:11:07,818
Good morning.

1213
01:11:09,538 --> 01:11:12,378
- Good morning.
- How would you like your eggs?

1214
01:11:12,618 --> 01:11:13,818
Where do you think you're going?

1215
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:16,618
Do you think you can do what you did
last night and get away with it?

1216
01:11:16,698 --> 01:11:18,778
Ruin a young girl's future
just because she loves you?

1217
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:21,498
I don't know where I am,
or what you're saying.

1218
01:11:21,578 --> 01:11:23,938
That's too bad. I'll tell you where you are.

1219
01:11:23,978 --> 01:11:26,098
I know where I am, all right.

1220
01:11:26,538 --> 01:11:29,898
I mean, figuratively speaking,
I'm confused.

1221
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:33,658
- I don't know what happened.
- Well, I do.

1222
01:11:33,698 --> 01:11:36,658
Plenty, brother, plenty.

1223
01:11:38,738 --> 01:11:40,178
Tell me...

1224
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:44,818
- now what do you want me to do?
- Sit down.

1225
01:11:46,778 --> 01:11:49,698
- How much is it worth to you?
- Worth? What for?

1226
01:11:49,858 --> 01:11:52,258
Call it payment for a night's lodging,
if you like.

1227
01:11:52,338 --> 01:11:53,658
You don't mean it.

1228
01:11:53,698 --> 01:11:57,258
- Polly doesn't know...
- Listen, what do you think Polly is?

1229
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:00,978
I never would have believed it.

1230
01:12:02,098 --> 01:12:04,138
But why not? What else could I expect?

1231
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:06,058
You said it. What else?

1232
01:12:08,578 --> 01:12:11,298
I know what you need, a pen.

1233
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:20,778
$5,000, is that satisfactory?

1234
01:12:20,858 --> 01:12:23,618
What do you think this is, the Mills Hotel?

1235
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:26,938
$10,000, then.

1236
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,618
And that's all I'll do.

1237
01:12:30,658 --> 01:12:33,298
Well, don't feel generous. It's not so much.

1238
01:12:33,378 --> 01:12:35,538
- That's your opinion.
- The pen?

1239
01:12:37,498 --> 01:12:39,698
And now, have you any objection
if I go on my way?

1240
01:12:39,778 --> 01:12:42,338
Objections? Let me open the door for you.

1241
01:12:46,818 --> 01:12:49,858
- Thank you.
- Come back when you can't stay so long.

1242
01:12:54,898 --> 01:12:56,258
I've got it.

1243
01:12:57,098 --> 01:12:59,578
- Got what?
- Rest your eyes on that.

1244
01:13:02,018 --> 01:13:05,338
- What's the matter, isn't it enough?
- I don't want it. I don't want any of it.

1245
01:13:05,418 --> 01:13:07,258
Say, what's the matter with you?
I knew it.

1246
01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:09,858
You are carrying the torch
for that Back Bay codfish.

1247
01:13:09,938 --> 01:13:11,698
I'm not. I hate him.

1248
01:13:12,178 --> 01:13:15,218
Sure you do. Why he's got
no more feelings than a hyena.

1249
01:13:15,298 --> 01:13:17,658
He has, too.
Don't you talk that way about him.

1250
01:13:17,738 --> 01:13:20,578
Why? We've just been playing him
for a sucker. He's just a chump.

1251
01:13:20,618 --> 01:13:23,218
He's not a chump.
He's kind, and he's good.

1252
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,138
Sure, you hate him, all right.

1253
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:28,898
No, I don't. I love him.

1254
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,578
I've never felt so happy in all my life.

1255
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:41,338
I've got a confession to make.

1256
01:13:44,898 --> 01:13:45,978
Well?

1257
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,538
Well...

1258
01:14:00,818 --> 01:14:01,938
Last night...

1259
01:14:02,018 --> 01:14:04,858
I told Miss Lorraine, Trixie...

1260
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:07,778
that I cared for her deeply...

1261
01:14:08,298 --> 01:14:11,018
and she admitted
an equal affection for me.

1262
01:14:12,338 --> 01:14:15,138
For the first time in my life, true love...

1263
01:14:15,298 --> 01:14:17,578
real love, with a real woman.

1264
01:14:22,818 --> 01:14:25,578
Look. Look at that.

1265
01:14:45,498 --> 01:14:48,338
- I've been tricked.
- You certainly have.

1266
01:14:49,658 --> 01:14:51,178
That's the girl.

1267
01:14:51,298 --> 01:14:54,018
That's the girl
Robert planned to marry all along.

1268
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:56,218
The one I intended to save him from.

1269
01:14:56,298 --> 01:15:00,098
There's no doubt about it.
They've certainly made a fool of you.

1270
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,578
- What about you?
- Who, me? Well, I...

1271
01:15:05,738 --> 01:15:08,818
Did you know?
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?

1272
01:15:09,698 --> 01:15:12,778
What do you think
I brought you along for, anyway?

1273
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:17,778
To heave ponderous,
ridiculous sighs at that giraffe?

1274
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:20,538
Who are you calling a giraffe, sir?

1275
01:15:20,858 --> 01:15:24,138
- I've a suspicion it's the woman I love.
- You love.

1276
01:15:24,418 --> 01:15:26,298
You give me a pain.

1277
01:15:26,338 --> 01:15:28,378
You're coming along with me.

1278
01:15:28,418 --> 01:15:31,298
- I'll show them I'm not such an easy mark.
- Where to?

1279
01:15:31,338 --> 01:15:32,698
To that woman's house.

1280
01:15:32,738 --> 01:15:35,298
The one who posed as Polly Parker,
who led me on.

1281
01:15:35,378 --> 01:15:37,338
I'm not going with you. I can't.

1282
01:15:37,418 --> 01:15:38,858
- Why?
- Well...

1283
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,578
I have a dinner engagement.

1284
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:44,978
- A conference.
- All right, I'll go by myself.

1285
01:15:46,698 --> 01:15:48,338
But I'll show her.

1286
01:15:49,218 --> 01:15:51,218
But I never said
your brother wanted to marry me...

1287
01:15:51,298 --> 01:15:52,978
and I never said my name is Polly.

1288
01:15:53,058 --> 01:15:56,058
- I took that for granted.
- You take too darn much for granted.

1289
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:58,738
- I'll ask you to return my check, please.
- Your check?

1290
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:01,618
That's on exhibition
over there on the wall.

1291
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:07,378
I knew you'd probably stop payment on it.

1292
01:16:14,018 --> 01:16:16,058
- I'll take the necessary steps...
- You'll do what?

1293
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:17,618
Listen, you made a sap out of yourself...

1294
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,778
and you tried your best
to make a sap out of me.

1295
01:16:19,858 --> 01:16:22,338
Now I never want to see you again,
understand?

1296
01:16:22,418 --> 01:16:24,178
And as for your check...

1297
01:16:24,258 --> 01:16:26,858
Well, you don't think I hold myself
as cheaply as all that, do you?

1298
01:16:26,938 --> 01:16:30,738
- Cheaply? $10,000?
- That's your estimate of me, not mine.

1299
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:33,378
That check is framed, not cashed.

1300
01:16:33,698 --> 01:16:34,818
I put it there to remind me...

1301
01:16:34,898 --> 01:16:37,218
never to get mixed up
with your kind again.

1302
01:16:37,298 --> 01:16:39,618
Now get out, will you, please? Get out.

1303
01:16:39,658 --> 01:16:41,018
No, I will not get out.

1304
01:16:41,058 --> 01:16:42,818
- You must.
- No, I will not.

1305
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,818
Not until I've told you what I think of you.

1306
01:16:44,898 --> 01:16:46,778
Don't you dare. Get out.

1307
01:16:49,058 --> 01:16:51,658
I was drunk the last time. I'm not now.

1308
01:16:51,938 --> 01:16:54,098
I mean it. I love you, Polly.

1309
01:16:55,498 --> 01:16:58,338
- My name's not Polly.
- Whatever your name is.

1310
01:16:58,738 --> 01:17:02,138
Carol, that's my name.
Cheap and vulgar Carol.

1311
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:05,778
Daughter of a Brooklyn saloon keeper
and a woman who took in washing.

1312
01:17:05,858 --> 01:17:09,338
Carol, the torch singer at Coney Island,
cheap and vulgar.

1313
01:17:09,578 --> 01:17:13,178
Every time you say cheap and vulgar,
I'm going to kiss you.

1314
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:14,898
Cheap and vulgar.

1315
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:17,018
Cheap and vulgar.

1316
01:17:17,178 --> 01:17:18,738
Cheap and vulgar.

1317
01:17:27,138 --> 01:17:28,898
I didn't mean to fall in love with you.

1318
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,778
I was only playing a game.

1319
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:33,458
I didn't mean to fall in love
with you, either.

1320
01:17:33,538 --> 01:17:36,258
I was trying to play
a little game myself.

1321
01:17:37,378 --> 01:17:39,498
You're going to forgive Brad and Polly,
aren't you?

1322
01:17:39,578 --> 01:17:41,618
- No, I'm not.
- But you must.

1323
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,258
- Lf they're married...
- They are.

1324
01:17:43,298 --> 01:17:46,778
- They phoned me from the city hall.
- I'll have their marriage annulled.

1325
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:49,138
- But you said...
- I don't care what I said.

1326
01:17:49,218 --> 01:17:51,018
I was confused, upset.

1327
01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:54,498
Maybe you're confused about us.

1328
01:17:54,578 --> 01:17:56,658
No, that's one thing I'm sure about.

1329
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,378
But their marriage is off, definitely off.

1330
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,258
Well, then so is ours.

1331
01:18:01,818 --> 01:18:04,698
- You mean you won't marry me?
- I certainly do.

1332
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:07,138
- I'm late. The show. Sorry.
- Polly...

1333
01:18:07,178 --> 01:18:08,458
- See you later.
- Carol.

1334
01:18:08,538 --> 01:18:11,418
You haven't told me.
We've got to settle this. Carol.

1335
01:18:39,738 --> 01:18:43,698
<i>Shadows on the wall</i>

1336
01:18:43,778 --> 01:18:46,538

On stage.

1378
01:24:29,418 --> 01:24:30,538
On stage.

1379
01:24:32,738 --> 01:24:35,538

On stage, Forgotten Man number.</i>

1380

everybody on stage.</i>

1381

Forgotten Man number, on stage.</i>

1382
01:24:40,218 --> 01:24:42,858
<i>- All right, girls, on stage.
- Forgotten Man number.</i>

1383
01:24:42,938 --> 01:24:44,698
<i>On stage, Forgotten Man number.</i>

1384
01:24:44,738 --> 01:24:47,578
<i>All right, Miss Carol,
Forgotten Man number.</i>

1385
01:24:51,618 --> 01:24:53,778
- Congratulate us. We are man and wife.
- You're not.

1386
01:24:53,858 --> 01:24:57,018
- I ought to know, I'm the bride.
- Trixie, I'm so glad.

1387
01:24:57,098 --> 01:24:59,938
- We're married, too.
- My heartiest congratulations.

1388
01:24:59,978 --> 01:25:02,138
- Same to you, Peabody.
- Isn't it wonderful?

1389
01:25:02,218 --> 01:25:05,058
- At my age?
- At any age.

1390
01:25:05,258 --> 01:25:06,738
Come on, honey.

1391
01:25:09,178 --> 01:25:10,338
- Hello.
- Hello.

1392
01:25:10,418 --> 01:25:11,778
I got him signed, sealed, and delivered.

1393
01:25:11,858 --> 01:25:14,218
Good girl. Keep him close to home.

1394
01:25:15,218 --> 01:25:16,938
Here, wait a minute.

1395
01:25:17,538 --> 01:25:19,818
I understand you two are married.

1396
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:23,218
- I'm going to have it annulled.
- You can't annul our marriage.

1397
01:25:23,298 --> 01:25:25,138
Not yours, stupid, his.

1398
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:27,738
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

1399
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:40,218
You've interfered enough. We're married,
and we're going to stay married.

1400
01:25:40,258 --> 01:25:41,698
Today you asked me to marry you.

1401
01:25:41,738 --> 01:25:42,938
- He did?
- Yes, he did.

1402
01:25:42,978 --> 01:25:45,218
Yes, I proposed, and I was sincere.

1403
01:25:45,298 --> 01:25:46,458
If you do this to Polly and Brad...

1404
01:25:46,538 --> 01:25:48,578
I wouldn't marry you
if you were the last man on Earth.

1405
01:25:48,658 --> 01:25:50,458
I told you that once, and I meant it.

1406
01:25:50,498 --> 01:25:52,458
Much as I love you,
nevertheless, I am determined...

1407
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:55,058
to look after my brother's interests,
whether he likes it or not.

1408
01:25:55,138 --> 01:25:58,138
Arrest him. You have a warrant. Perjury.

1409
01:25:58,218 --> 01:26:00,378
Falsification of age
in obtaining a marriage license.

1410
01:26:00,418 --> 01:26:01,698
You can't hold me on that.

1411
01:26:01,778 --> 01:26:04,498
Technically, we can,
pending an investigation.

1412
01:26:04,578 --> 01:26:06,258
Brad, what are we going to do?

1413
01:26:06,338 --> 01:26:08,498
What's holding up the show?
Do you want to ruin me?

1414
01:26:08,578 --> 01:26:10,538
My brother just had me arrested
for getting married.

1415
01:26:10,618 --> 01:26:12,218
Arrested? Where's the cop?

1416
01:26:12,298 --> 01:26:14,378
Here he is. Detective Jones.

1417
01:26:14,818 --> 01:26:17,298
Detective, my eye. He's a ham actor.

1418
01:26:17,378 --> 01:26:18,938
That's no way to speak of an artist.

1419
01:26:18,978 --> 01:26:21,178
Why, I've played with Sir Henry Irving...

1420
01:26:21,258 --> 01:26:24,378
George Arliss, and David Warfield.

1421
01:26:24,738 --> 01:26:26,138
Scram. You're a washout.

1422
01:26:26,178 --> 01:26:28,738
You've been playing cops on Broadway
for 25 years.

1423
01:26:28,818 --> 01:26:31,378
- Snitch.
- Get out there and do your number.

1424
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:33,098
Is everybody nutty?

1425
01:26:33,178 --> 01:26:34,538
- Here.
- What's this?

1426
01:26:34,618 --> 01:26:37,218
I'm sure Carol will endorse it to you
for a wedding present.

1427
01:26:37,298 --> 01:26:39,218
$10,000. What a brother.

1428
01:26:40,098 --> 01:26:42,218
You mean, what a sister-in-law.

1429
01:26:42,298 --> 01:26:44,818
You mean, what a Fanny.

1430
01:27:24,938 --> 01:27:27,858
I don't know
if he deserves a bit of sympathy.

1431
01:27:28,898 --> 01:27:30,618
Forget your sympathy.

1432
01:27:31,498 --> 01:27:33,418
It's all right with me.

1433
01:27:34,698 --> 01:27:37,738
I was satisfied to drift along
from day to day...

1434
01:27:39,298 --> 01:27:42,698
till they came and took my man away.
