1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,800
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,640
If that's what you want to call it.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,840
I never thought it'd come to this.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,040
I guess I am.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,160
I won't have any ultimatum put to me, Lou.
I'll accept your resignation.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,680
You sure got it.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,320
You are one stubborn son of a bitch.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,400
You're making a big mistake.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,560
Boss, aren't you being a little hard?

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,960
No, I don't think I am.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
Anyone else?

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,000
<i>Now, Jerry, here's Jim Garrison...</i>

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,640
<i>... the District Attorney
of New Orleans, Louisiana.</i>

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,880
APPLAUSE

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,960
<i>Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.</i>

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,720
You're investigating the murder
of President Kennedy.

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,760
We have heard some strange things
coming out of your office.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,400
First, we heard that Cuban exiles
killed the President.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,000
<i>Then the mob...</i>

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,680
<i>Your latest theory seems to be
that the CIA and the FBI...</i>

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,040
<i>... and the Pentagon...</i>

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,720
...and the White House all combined
in an elaborate conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Is there anyone
besides Lee Harvey Oswald...

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,760
...who you think didn't conspire
to kill the President?

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,080
Let's just say this, Jerry...

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,320
...I've stopped beating my wife.

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,600
Maybe you should ask Lyndon Johnson.
He has some answers.

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,080
There have been a number of reports
in reputable news media...

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,840
...Time, Newsweek, our own NBC...

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,520
...that you've gone beyond legal means
as a prosecutor...

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,480
...that you've intimidated,
even drugged witnesses...

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,880
...bribed them, and urged them
to commit perjury.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,360
Do you have a response?

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,760
Your faith in the veracity
of the major media is touching.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,720
It indicates that the age of innocence
is not yet over.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
But ask yourself...

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,920
...if we had learned
on November 22, 1963...

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,280
...that the Russian Premier had been shot
from a Moscow building...

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,240
...by a lonely capitalist sympathizer...

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,440
...who, himself, was then liquidated
by a patriotic Muscovite within 48 hours...

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,240
...while surrounded by armed police.

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,680
I think it would be apparent to anyone...

43
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,240
...that a "coup d'état" and a transfer
of power had just taken place.

44
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,160
And we would not ask questions
or attack Jim Garrison.

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,480
We would, in a free-thinking society...

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,120
...be asking why he was killed,
and what forces opposed him.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,520
There are some people who might say
that you are paranoid.

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,160
I should show you some pictures
so you can understand...

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,000
...what I'm talking about.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,840
These are arrests.

51
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,360
These arrests were photographed
minutes after the assassination.

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,640
They were never shown to the public.

53
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,920
I'm sorry,
these pictures can't be shown on TV.

54
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,760
- Sure they can.
- No, I'm sorry. They can't.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,640
- The camera can pick these up.
- Jim, I'm sorry.

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,480
They can't. We have libel laws.

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,360
Those men you just saw were arrested
in Dallas minutes after the assassination.

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,120
They were never seen again.

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,360
No record of arrest,
no mug shots, no fingerprints.

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,640
Hold that thought.

61
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,040
<i>We'll be back,
right after these commercials.</i>

62
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,240
Bill, what the hell are you doing here?

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm sorry about the other day.
I didn't mean to walk out on you like that.

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,080
You came all this way
to tell me the obvious?

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,640
No. Look...

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,160
...I just heard of an attempt to kill you
between here and New Orleans.

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,640
A mob guy was brought down by Shaw
from Canada.

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,280
This is serious.
You'll need a bodyguard tonight.

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,240
When you were in the Army,
did you ever find out what an order meant?

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,360
Do you remember my orders
about passing on rumors...

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,560
...about someone going to be killed?

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,280
- Yes, I do, but this is...
- No, there is no "but".

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,440
There is no "but" in a military situation!

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,520
I don't appreciate you dumping
this paranoid garbage on me...

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,920
...nor your inability
to follow a simple order...

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,880
...especially when it means I have to pay
for your flight back to New Orleans.

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,920
Let's get you a ticket.

78
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,320
Boss, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for you.

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,440
Get a receipt.

80
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,840
Come on, come on. He's out here.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,640
Jim, where are you going?
It's me, Samuel.

82
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,880
- Hey, how long were you in that restroom?
- None of your goddamn business.

83
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,920
Jim, bad news, Bill's turned.

84
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,600
I think he's given everything we've got
to the feds.

85
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
We studied the memos
and there was nothing there. Nothing.

86
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,440
We went to confront him and the landlady
said the son of a bitch just left.

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,280
Left everything.

88
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,040
It's unbelievable. I'm sorry.

89
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,080
Mattie, could you get Mr. Garrison
a drink, please?

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,880
Something sure scared him.

91
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,800
Bill doesn't scare that easy.
Somebody got to his thinking.

92
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,840
- He was never that good a thinker.
- He sure fooled us.

93
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,200
No, no, leave it. Don't turn it down.
I want to see this.

94
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,240
You know what's happening, he's winning.

95
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,320
He'll never make it.

96
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,560
If he wins, they'll kill him.
He'll stop the war.

97
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,040
They'll kill him
before they let him be President.

98
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,920
With Broussard, they have everything...

99
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,560
...all our witnesses,
our strategies for the trial.

100
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,320
We got to double check his work.

101
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,240
There could be false leads.
We can't go to trial!

102
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,640
We don't have a prayer!

103
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,200
- I don't think so, Al.
- I have to agree with Al, Boss.

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,640
This is not one we'll come out on.

105
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,680
You remember the Hemingway story,
"The Old Man and the Sea"?

106
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,160
The old fisherman manages
to catch this great fish...

107
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,320
...a fish so huge, that he has to tie it
to the boat to get it back in.

108
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,120
By the time it reached shore...

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,880
...the fish had long since been picked apart
by sharks.

110
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,440
Nothing was left, but the skeleton.

111
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,320
- And that's what will happen to us.
- Then what did we do this for?

112
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,400
It's a means to an end.

113
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,640
This war has two fronts.

114
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,840
In a court of law,
we hope to get Clay Shaw for conspiracy.

115
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,800
In the court of public opinion,
it could take another 25, 30 years...

116
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,400
...for the truth to come out.

117
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,880
At least we'll strike the first blow.

118
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,880
What if you're wrong?

119
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,320
I never thought for a second I was.

120
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,880
Will you come to the trial?

121
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,120
I don't think so.

122
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,880
<i>With 53% of the precincts reporting,

Both brothers?

I wish I could've loved you more.

I didn't ever love you...

157
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,880
Convicted of pandering and soliciting.

158
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,600
A man who has lied about everything...

159
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,160
...and now wants to be taken at his word.

160
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,960
That man, right there. Yes, sir.

161
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,840
He was at the Pontchartrain wall...

162
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,000
...with the man who shot the President.

163
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,600
I remember him because of his limp.

164
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,800
A heroin addict injecting himself
at the wall.

165
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,080
Barely conscious of his surroundings.

166
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,080
- Is that the man?
- That was the man, right there.

167
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,520
He dropped Oswald off on the voter's line.

168
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,000
<i>I remember 'cause they were the only
white strangers around that day.</i>

169
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,680
<i>That big black Cadillac of his
made me think they might be FBI.</i>

170
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,720
Welcome to Clinton.
If you need any help, let us know.

171
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,000
<i>He said he was a representative
of Warren International Trade Mart.</i>

172
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,240
More than five years ago,
for two minutes...?

173
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
It's fair to say you could be mistaken.

174
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,760
Just a figment of my imagination.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
The cat's stewing you, I told him.

176
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,640
You got the right ta-ta,
but the wrong ho-ho.

177
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,320
Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor.
And you can tell him I said so.

178
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,480
Objection, Your Honor!

179
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,880
Andrews has been convicted of perjury
on this matter.

180
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,320
Exception taken. That case is on appeal.

181
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
Mr. Goldberg...

182
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,720
...you claim you met Ferrie and Shaw
on a vacation trip...

183
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
...from your accounting business
in New York.

184
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
You had drinks...

185
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,640
...and while drunk,
discussed killing Kennedy.

186
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,760
- Is that not so?
- Yes, I did.

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,520
Is it also true that you fingerprinted
your daughter when she went to college?

188
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,720
Yes, sir, I did.

189
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,720
Is it also true that you fingerprinted her
when she returned?

190
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,160
Yes, I did.

191
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,520
Why?

192
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,360
I wanted to make sure
she was the same girl I sent away.

193
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,720
He was one of Broussard's witnesses.

194
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,400
He was totally sane
when we took his affidavit.

195
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,040
Your Honor, we call Police Officer
Aloysius Habighorst to the stand.

196
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,600
I must ask the jury to leave the court.

197
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,960
Gentlemen, will you please rise
and follow me.

198
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,960
- Name?
- Clay La Verne Shaw.

199
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,080
Defendant didn't have his lawyer present.

200
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,160
It's standard booking procedure
to ask an alias!

201
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,640
I call them as I see them!

202
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,960
Any aliases?

203
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,880
Clay Bertrand.

204
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,560
It's not constitutionally required
that a lawyer be present!

205
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,600
- I'm ruling that inadmissible!
- That's our case!

206
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,280
Then you didn't have a case.

207
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,160
I wouldn't believe anything
Habighorst said anyway.

208
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
I can't believe you're saying this!

209
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,080
I am saying it. Bring in the jury.

210
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,600
<i>- Oswald?
- No, I did not.</i>

211
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,040
<i>- Ever call Dean Andrews?
- No, I did not.</i>

212
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,440
Have you ever met David Ferrie?

213
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,160
Wouldn't even know what he looked like
if I hadn't seen pictures.

214
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,480
Did you ever use the alias, Clay Bertrand?

215
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,760
No, I did not.

216
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,240
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

217
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,040
A very great actor has just given us
a great performance.

218
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,920
But we are nowhere closer to the truth.

219
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,920
My office is charging Clay Shaw
with outright perjury...

220
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,240
...on 15 answers he's given today,
not one word being true.

221
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,960
You're out of order! Now, sit down!

222
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,480
That's the man right there.

223
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,960
To prove there was a conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw...

224
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,720
...we must prove there was more than
one man involved in the assassination.

225
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,880
To do that...

226
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,040
...we must look at the Zapruder film
which my office subpoenaed.

227
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,080
The American public has not seen...

228
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,880
...has not seen the film. It's been locked
in a vault the last five years...

229
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,280
...in the Time-Life Building in New York.

230
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,200
There's a reason for that.

231
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,840
Watch.

232
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,360
"The picture speaks 1,000 words."

233
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,400
The Warren Commission thought they had
an open-and-shut case.

234
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,240
Three bullets, one assassin.

235
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,600
Two unpredictable things happened
that day to make it impossible.

236
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,520
One, the film shot by Abraham Zapruder
while standing near the grassy knoll.

237
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,800
Two, the third wounded man,
James Teague, nicked by a fragment...

238
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,400
<i>... while standing near the triple underpass.</i>

239
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,160
The time frame, 5.6 seconds,
established by the Zapruder film...

240
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,960
...left no possibility of a fourth shot.

241
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,200
So the shot of fragment that left
a superficial wound on Teague's cheek...

242
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,120
...came from one of the three bullets
fired from the Depository's sixth floor.

243
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,440
That leaves just two bullets.

244
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,440
We know one was the fatal head shot
that killed Kennedy.

245
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,520
So a single bullet remains.

246
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,840
A single bullet must account for the seven
wounds in Kennedy and Connally.

247
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,960
Rather than admit to a conspiracy
or investigate further...

248
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,400
...the Warren Commission
endorsed the theory...

249
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,680
...put forth by an ambitious attorney,
Arlen Spector.

250
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,720
One of the grossest lies ever forced
on the American people.

251
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,600
It's known as the "magic bullet" theory.

252
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,200
The magic bullet...

253
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,960
...enters the President's back,
headed downward at a 17-degree angle.

254
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,960
It then moves upwards to leave Kennedy's
body from the front of his neck...

255
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,880
...wound #2...

256
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,560
...where it waits 1.6 seconds...

257
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,880
...presumably in midair,
where it turns right, then left...

258
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
...right, then left...

259
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,680
...and continues
into Connally's right armpit.

260
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,600
Wound #3.

261
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,880
The bullet then heads down at an angle
of 27 degrees, shattering his rib...

262
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,200
...and exiting from the right side
of his chest. Wound #4.

263
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,440
The bullet turns right, reentering
Connally's body at his right wrist.

264
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,360
Wound #5.

265
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
Shattering the radius bone...

266
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,520
...the bullet exits Connally's wrist,
wound #6...

267
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,240
...makes a dramatic U-turn,
then buries itself in Connally's left thigh.

268
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,640
Wound #7, from which it later falls out...

269
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,680
...and is found
in almost pristine condition...

270
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,360
<i>... on a stretcher in a corridor
of Parkland Hospital.</i>

271
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,000
Some bullet.

272
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,200
Any combat vet can tell you,
never in the history of gunfire...

273
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,600
...has there been a bullet this ridiculous.

274
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,720
The government says it can prove it
with some fancy physics in a nuclear lab.

275
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,240
Of course they can.

276
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,560
Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff...

277
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
...with his tail tied to a daisy.

278
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,280
But use your eyes, your common sense.

279
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,920
The Army wound ballistics experts
fired some comparison bullets.

280
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,120
Not one of them looked anything like this.

281
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,880
Take a look at CE-856.

282
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,600
An identical bullet...

283
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,920
...fired through the wrist
of a human cadaver...

284
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,840
...just one of the bones smashed
by the magic bullet.

285
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,720
Seven wounds, gentlemen.

286
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,440
Tough skin...

287
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,080
...dense bones.

288
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,360
This single-bullet explanation...

289
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,720
...is the foundation of the Warren
Commission's claim of one assassin.

290
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,120
And once you conclude...

291
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,320
...the magic bullet couldn't create
all seven wounds...

292
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,840
...you must conclude there was
a fourth shot and a second rifleman.

293
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,280
And if there was a second rifleman...

294
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,880
...then by definition there had
to be a conspiracy...

295
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,760
...which we believe
involves the accused, Clay Shaw.

296
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Fifty-one witnesses thought
they heard shots from the grassy knoll...

297
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,000
...which is to the right,
in front of the President.

298
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,360
Key witnesses that day?

299
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,120
Charles Brehm, a combat vet.

300
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,200
Right behind, Jean Hill and Mary Moorman.

301
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,040
S.M. Holland, Richard Dodd,
James Simmons...

302
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,640
<i>... standing on the overpass. J.C. Price...</i>

303
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,160
<i>... overlooking the plaza.</i>

304
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,960
<i>William Newman, father of two children.</i>

305
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,600
He hit the deck on the north side of Elm.

306
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,920
Abraham Zapruder.

307
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,360
Each of these key witnesses
has no doubt whatsoever...

308
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,240
<i>... one or more shots came
from behind the picket fence.</i>

309
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Twenty-six trained medical personnel
at Parkland Hospital...

310
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,800
...saw the back of the President's head
blasted out!

311
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,280
Doctor Peters.

312
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,960
There was a large 7 cm opening
at the right occipital parietal area.

313
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,480
<i>A considerable portion
of the brain was missing.</i>

314
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,040
A fifth or possibly a quarter of the back
of the head had been blasted out...

315
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,240
<i>... along with the underlying brain tissue.</i>

316
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,160
When's the proper time
to declare one dead?

317
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,360
<i>There was also a large fragment of skull
attached to a flap of the scalp.</i>

318
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,320
<i>The exit hole in the rear of his head
measured about 120 mm...</i>

319
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,000
<i>... or five inches, across.</i>

320
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,200
<i>Not one of the civilian doctors
who examined the President...</i>

321
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,200
<i>... regarded his throat wound as anything
but an entry wound.</i>

322
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,720
But then the body was illegally moved
to Washington for the autopsy.

323
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
<i>Because when a "coup d'état" has occurred...</i>

324
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,280
<i>... there's a big difference between
an autopsy performed by civilian doctors...</i>

325
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,760
<i>... and one that is performed
by military doctors under orders.</i>

326
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,680
<i>The departure of Air Force One, Friday
afternoon was not so much a takeoff...</i>

327
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,840
<i>... as it was a getaway,
with the newly sworn in President.</i>

328
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Objection!</i>

329
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,000
Sustained.

330
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,480
On the plane, the White House Situation
Room announced Oswald's guilt...

331
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,360
...to all passengers before any kind
of investigation had begun.

332
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,280
The "angry lone nut" solution
is beginning to take shape.

333
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,440
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

334
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,040
Please bottle the acid.

335
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,160
<i>The three Bethesda doctors picked by
the military left something to be desired.</i>

336
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,040
<i>None of them had experience
with combat-gunfire wounds.</i>

337
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,480
<i>Through their autopsy, we've been able
to justify eight wounds from two bullets.</i>

338
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,840
<i>Three to Kennedy, five to Connally.</i>

339
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
<i>One of them being the "magic bullet".</i>

340
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,720
- FBI?
- Here.

341
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,440
Col. Finck, are you saying someone
told you not to dissect the neck?

342
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,320
I was told the family wanted
the examination of the head.

343
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,680
Oh, Christ.

344
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,440
Looks like half his brain is gone.

345
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,760
- Weigh it.
- 653 grams.

346
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,840
<i>As a pathologist, it was your obligation
to explore...</i>

347
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,720
<i>... all possible causes of death.</i>

348
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,320
I had the cause of death.

349
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,520
Your Honor, please direct the witness
to answer my question.

350
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Why did Col. Finck not dissect
the tract of the bullet wound?

351
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,920
<i>I heard Dr. Humes stating...</i>

352
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,040
That's enough. That's enough.

353
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,840
It's duly noted.

354
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,160
Let's check the back.

355
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,160
I can feel the end of the wound
with my finger.

356
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,720
That won't be necessary.

357
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,480
Watch the ear!

358
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,000
Shot in the back. Cheap crime.

359
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,200
<i>He said:</i>

360
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,200
Who's in charge here?

361
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,480
I am.

362
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,520
<i>I don't remember his name.</i>

363
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,480
It was quite crowded.

364
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,160
<i>And when you are called to look
at the wounds of the dead President...</i>

365
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,200
<i>... you don't ask people for their names
and who they are.</i>

366
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,720
<i>But you were a qualified pathologist.
Was the Army General?</i>

367
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,360
<i>No.</i>

368
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,320
<i>But you took his orders.</i>

369
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,320
Yes.

370
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,880
- So he was directing the autopsy.
- No.

371
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,680
There were others.

372
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,880
There were admirals.

373
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,240
When you're a Lieutenant Colonel,
you follow orders.

374
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,720
It is not our business to discuss this
with anyone outside this room.

375
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,920
As I recall, Admiral Kenney,
Navy Surgeon General...

376
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,760
<i>... specifically told us
not to discuss the case.</i>

377
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,200
A lot of people were deciding
what was private...

378
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,760
...none of the American people's business.

379
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,840
The chief pathologist, Commander Humes...

380
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,560
...by his own admission,
voluntarily burned his autopsy notes.

381
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,320
President Johnson orders
the blood-soaked limousine...

382
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,080
<i>... filled with bullet holes and clues
to be washed and rebuilt.</i>

383
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,920
He sends Connally's bloody suit
to the cleaners.

384
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,800
The Justice Department denied this office
access to the autopsy photos.

385
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,400
When we finally get a court order
to examine Kennedy's brain...

386
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,800
...in the hopes of finding
from which direction the bullet came...

387
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,880
...we're told...

388
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,440
...by your government that
the President's brain has disappeared.

389
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,560
That's not all that's disappeared.
With it, the concept of justice.

390
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,560
Objection. Mr. Garrison is insulting
the federal government...

391
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,840
Overruled!

392
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,520
So, what really happened that day?

393
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,480
Let's just for a moment speculate,
shall we?

394
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,280
We have the epileptic seizure...

395
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,080
<i>... distracting the police and allowing
the shooters to get into place.</i>

396
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,200
<i>The epileptic later vanished,
never checking into the hospital.</i>

397
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,320
<i>The A-team goes to the sixth floor
of the Depository.</i>

398
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,440
<i>They were refurbishing the floors
of the Depository that week...</i>

399
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,640
<i>... allowing unknown workmen
in the building.</i>

400
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,520
<i>They move quickly into position,
minutes before the shooting.</i>

401
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,520
<i>The second spotter, talking by radio to
the other teams, has the best overall view.</i>

402
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,080
<i>The God spot.</i>

403
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,920
<i>B-team, one rifleman and one spotter
with access to the building...</i>

404
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,680
<i>... moves into a low floor
of the Dal-Tex building.</i>

405
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,560
<i>The third team, C-team, moves in
behind the fence above the grassy knoll...</i>

406
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,680
<i>... where the shooter and the spotter
are first seen by the late Lee Bowers.</i>

407
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,160
<i>They have the best position.</i>

408
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,680
<i>Kennedy is close and on a flat,
low trajectory.</i>

409
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,680
<i>Part of this team is a coordinator...</i>

410
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,880
<i>... who flashed security credentials
at people, chasing them from the area.</i>

411
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,800
<i>Probably two to three more men
are in the crowd.</i>

412
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,800
<i>Ten to twelve men.
Three teams. Three shooters.</i>

413
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,280
<i>The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and
David Ferrie discussed two months before.</i>

414
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,320
<i>They blocked the plaza.</i>

415
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,760
<i>They know every inch.</i>

416
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,560
<i>They've calibrated their sights.
Practiced on moving targets.</i>

417
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,560
<i>They're ready.</i>

418
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,640
<i>Kennedy's motorcade makes a turn
from Main onto Houston.</i>

419
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,360
<i>It's going to be a turkey shoot.</i>

420
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,320
<i>They don't shoot him on Houston...</i>

421
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,920
<i>... the easiest shot for a single shooter
in the Depository.</i>

422
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,720
<i>They wait till he gets to the killing zone
between three rifles.</i>

423
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,480
<i>Kennedy makes the turn
from Houston onto Elm.</i>

424
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,400
<i>Slowing down to some 11 miles an hour.</i>

425
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,800
<i>The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,
taking their aim.</i>

426
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,760
<i>Waiting for the radio to say,
"Green! Green!"</i>

427
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,760
<i>Or, "Abort! Abort!"</i>

428
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,640
<i>The first shot rings out.</i>

429
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,120
<i>Sounding like a backfire,
it misses the car completely.</i>

430
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,600
Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving
as he hears something.

431
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,440
<i>Connally's head turns slightly to the right.</i>

432
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,960
<i>Frame 193, the second shot hits Kennedy
in the throat from the front.</i>

433
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,480
<i>Frame 225, Kennedy emerges
from behind the road sign.</i>

434
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,400
<i>He's been hit, raising his hands
to his throat.</i>

435
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,760
<i>The third shot, frame 232...</i>

436
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,480
<i>... hits Kennedy in the back,
pulling him downward and forward.</i>

437
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,760
<i>Connally, you will notice,
shows no sign of being hit.</i>

438
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,760
<i>He is holding his Stetson, which is
impossible if his wrist is shattered.</i>

439
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,600
<i>Connally is turning now.</i>

440
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,080
Frame 238. The fourth shot.

441
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,520
<i>It misses Kennedy and takes Connally
in the back.</i>

442
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,400
<i>This is the shot that proves
there were two rifles.</i>

443
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,000
<i>Connally yells, "My God!
They're going to kill us all!"</i>

444
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,360
<i>Around this time,
another shot misses the car completely...</i>

445
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,720
<i>... striking James Teague by the underpass.</i>

446
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,160
<i>The car brakes.</i>

447
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,000
<i>The sixth and fatal shot.</i>

448
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,760
<i>Frame 313, takes Kennedy in the head
from the front.</i>

449
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,960
<i>This is the key shot.</i>

450
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,040
<i>The President going back and to his left...</i>

451
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,040
<i>... shot from the front and right.</i>

452
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,480
<i>Totally inconsistent with the shot
from the Depository.</i>

453
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,120
<i>Again.</i>

454
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,360
<i>Back, and to the left.</i>

455
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,440
<i>Back, and to the left.</i>

456
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,880
Back, and to the left.

457
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,920
<i>So what happens then?</i>

458
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,440
<i>Pandemonium.</i>

459
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,080
Let's go! We got him!

460
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,960
<i>The shooters quickly disassemble their
various weapons, except the Oswald rifle.</i>

461
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,840
<i>Patrolman Smith rushes to the parking lot
behind the fence.</i>

462
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,280
<i>He smells gunpowder.</i>

463
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,920
He produced credentials showing him
to be Secret Service.

464
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,600
Let's see your ID.
See anyone else up here?

465
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,800
<i>I accepted that and let him go.</i>

466
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,480
<i>I regretted it. He looked like a mechanic.</i>

467
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,200
<i>He had on a sports shirt and pants,
but he had dirty fingernails.</i>

468
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,120
<i>Afterward, it didn't ring true.
But at the time...</i>

469
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,920
...we were so pressed for time.

470
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,560
<i>All Secret Servicemen
in Dallas are accounted for.</i>

471
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,760
<i>None were on foot in Dealey Plaza
before or after the shooting...</i>

472
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,200
...till the Dallas Secret Service chief
returned at 12:55.

473
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,840
<i>The Dallas police took at least 12 people
into custody.</i>

474
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,480
No record of their arrest.

475
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,200
Men acting like hoboes
were pulled off trains...

476
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,680
...marched through Dealey Plaza,
photographed.

477
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
<i>Yet there's no record of their arrest.</i>

478
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,400
<i>Men identifying themselves
as Secret Service agents were everywhere.</i>

479
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
But who was impersonating them?

480
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,800
Where was Oswald?

481
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,960
<i>Around 12:15, leaving the building
to see the motorcade...</i>

482
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,000
<i>... Carolyn Arnold sees Oswald
in the second-floor snack room...</i>

483
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,800
...where he said he went for a Coke.

484
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,400
He was in a booth on the right side
of the room.

485
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,240
<i>He was by himself as usual,
appeared to be having lunch.</i>

486
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,440
<i>I didn't speak to him,
but I recognized him clearly.</i>

487
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,400
<i>At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams is
supposedly eating lunch in the sixth floor.</i>

488
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,880
<i>He's there until 12:15, maybe 12:20.</i>

489
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,000
<i>He sees nobody.</i>

490
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,360
<i>Arnold Rowlands, on the street, looks up,
sees two men in the sixth-floor windows...</i>

491
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,320
<i>... presumably after Williams
finished his lunch and left.</i>

492
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,160
<i>John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth floor
of the county jail, sees them.</i>

493
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,640
<i>Many of us saw them.</i>

494
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,080
Everyone was hollering and yelling.
We thought they was security guys.

495
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,120
If Oswald was the assassin, he was
nonchalant about moving into position.

496
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,840
<i>Later, he told police he was
in the second-floor snack room.</i>

497
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,600
<i>Probably told to wait there
by his handler for a call.</i>

498
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,000
<i>But the phone call never came.</i>

499
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,640
<i>Maximum 90 seconds
after Kennedy is shot...</i>

500
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,840
<i>... Patrolman Marrion Baker sees Oswald
in that second-floor lunchroom.</i>

501
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,520
Is this man an employee?

502
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,280
Yes. The President's been shot.

503
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,320
<i>The Commission would have us believe...</i>

504
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,160
<i>... that after firing three bolt-action shots
in 5.6 seconds...</i>

505
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,640
<i>... Oswald then leaves three cartridges
neatly side-by-side in the firing nest...</i>

506
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,000
<i>... wipes fingerprints off the rifle,
stashes it on the other side of the loft...</i>

507
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,320
<i>... sprints down five flights of stairs...</i>

508
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,400
<i>... past Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles
who never see him...</i>

509
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,160
<i>... then shows up, cool and calm, on the
second floor in front of Patrolman Baker.</i>

510
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,920
<i>All this within a maximum of 90 seconds
of the shooting.</i>

511
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,960
Is this man an employee?

512
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,080
Yes. The President's been shot.

513
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,000
<i>Is he out of breath?</i>

514
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,800
<i>According to Baker, absolutely not.</i>

515
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,160
<i>Assuming he is the sole assassin,
Oswald is free to leave the building.</i>

516
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,200
<i>The longer he delays, the more chance
the building will be sealed by police.</i>

517
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,160
<i>Is he guilty? Does he walk
out the nearest staircase?</i>

518
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,360
<i>He buys a Coke...</i>

519
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,800
<i>... and at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid
on the second floor...</i>

520
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,320
<i>... he strolls out
the more distant front exit...</i>

521
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
<i>... where cops have gathered.</i>

522
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,040
<i>Odd, since three shots were fired
from there...</i>

523
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,280
<i>... nobody seals the Depository
for ten more minutes.</i>

524
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,400
<i>Oswald slips out,
as do several other employees.</i>

525
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,800
<i>When he realized something had gone
wrong and Kennedy had been killed...</i>

526
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,040
...he knew there was a problem.
Maybe even that he was the patsy.

527
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,160
<i>An intuition, maybe. The President killed
in spite of his warning.</i>

528
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,120
The phone call that never came.

529
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,040
Perhaps fear now came to Oswald
for the very first time.

530
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,080
<i>Oswald returns to his rooming house
around 1:00 p.m. ...</i>

531
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,600
<i>... a half hour after the assassination.</i>

532
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,320
A man shot the President!

533
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,320
<i>He puts on his jacket,
grabs his.38 revolver...</i>

534
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,720
<i>... and leaves at 1:04.</i>

535
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,800
<i>Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper,
heard two beeps on a car horn.</i>

536
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,280
<i>Two uniformed cops pulled up
while Oswald was in his room.</i>

537
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,840
<i>Like it was a signal.</i>

538
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,240
<i>Officer Tippit is shot between 1:10
and 1:15, a mile away.</i>

539
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,960
<i>And though no one saw him walking...</i>

540
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,760
<i>... the government says
Oswald covered that distance.</i>

541
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,280
<i>Giving the government the benefit
of the doubt...</i>

542
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,360
<i>... Oswald would've had to jog a mile
in six to eleven minutes...</i>

543
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,120
<i>... then commit the murder,
reverse his direction...</i>

544
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,120
<i>... and walk three-fifths of a mile
to the Texas Theater...</i>

545
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,320
<i>... and arrive sometime before 1:30.</i>

546
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,520
<i>It's also a useful conclusion.</i>

547
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,040
<i>After all, why would Oswald
kill Officer Tippit...</i>

548
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,640
<i>... unless he just shot the President
and feared arrest?</i>

549
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,120
<i>Domingo Benevides...</i>

550
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
<i>... the closest witness to the shooting...</i>

551
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,680
<i>... refused to identify Oswald as the killer
and was never taken to a lineup.</i>

552
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,880
<i>Acquilla Clemons...</i>

553
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,920
<i>... saw the killer and another man
go off in separate directions.</i>

554
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,040
<i>Mrs. Clemons was never taken to a lineup
or to the Warren Commission.</i>

555
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,040
<i>At the scene, Officer Poe marks
his initials on the shells...</i>

556
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,520
<i>... to record the chain of evidence.</i>

557
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,400
<i>Those initials are not
on the three cartridge cases...</i>

558
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,120
<i>... which the Warren Commission show him.</i>

559
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,440
<i>As early as 12:44, only 14 minutes
after the assassination...</i>

560
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,080
<i>... the police put out a description
matching Oswald's size and build.</i>

561
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,480
<i>Oswald is next seen by a shoe salesman,
Johnny Brewer, on Jefferson Avenue.</i>

562
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,000
<i>Oswald is scared. He begins to realize
the full implications of this thing.</i>

563
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,920
<i>He goes to the Texas Theater,
possibly a prearranged meeting point.</i>

564
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,760
<i>Though he has $14 in his pocket,
he doesn't buy the $0.75 ticket.</i>

565
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,040
<i>Brewer has the cashier call the police.</i>

566
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,520
<i>In response to that call...</i>

567
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,000
<i>... at least 30 officers in patrol cars descend
on the movie theater.</i>

568
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,360
<i>This is the most remarkable example
of police intuition...</i>

569
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,160
<i>... since the Reichstag fire.</i>

570
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,520
<i>I don't buy it!</i>

571
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,080
<i>They knew. Someone knew
Oswald would be there.</i>

572
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
<i>Brewer leads the cops into the theater...</i>

573
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,600
<i>... and from the stage, points Oswald out.</i>

574
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,360
There he is.

575
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,520
Sir, can I get you to stand up?

576
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,920
I am not resisting arrest!
I am not resisting arrest!

577
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,360
<i>They have their man.</i>

578
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,880
It's already been decided in Washington.

579
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,600
<i>When he is brought from the theater...</i>

580
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,120
<i>... a crowd is waiting to scream at him.</i>

581
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,640
<i>Lee Oswald must have felt like Joseph K.
in Kafka's "The Trial".</i>

582
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,960
<i>He's never given reasons for his arrest.</i>

583
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,480
<i>He doesn't know the unseen forces
ranging against him.</i>

584
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,240
At police headquarters, he was booked
for murdering Tippit.

585
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,080
<i>No legal counsel was provided.</i>

586
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
<i>No record made of the questioning.</i>

587
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,040
<i>When the sun rises the next morning...</i>

588
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,640
<i>... he is booked for murdering the President.</i>

589
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,000
<i>The whole country, fueled by the media,
assumes he is guilty.</i>

590
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,280
<i>Under the guise of a patriotic club owner...</i>

591
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,240
<i>... out to spare Jackie Kennedy
from testifying at a trial...</i>

592
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,720
<i>... Jack Ruby is let into a garage...</i>

593
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,360
<i>... by one of his inside men
on the police force.</i>

594
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,160
<i>Oswald is brought out
like a sacrificial lamb...</i>

595
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,920
<i>... and nicely disposed of as an enemy
of the people.</i>

596
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,840
<i>Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald...</i>

597
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,640
...buried in a cheap grave
under the name Oswald?

598
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,320
<i>Nobody.</i>

599
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,680
False statements and press leaks
about Oswald circulate the globe.

600
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,520
<i>The official legend is created
and the media takes it from there.</i>

601
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,160
The glitter of official lies
and the epic splendor of JFK's funeral...

602
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,600
...confuse the eye
and confound the understanding.

603
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,560
Hitler said:

604
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,000
"The bigger the lie,
the more people will believe it."

605
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,480
Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed,
lonely man who wanted attention...

606
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,520
...and got it by killing a President
was only the first in a long line of patsies.

607
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,440
In later years, Bobby Kennedy,
Martin Luther King...

608
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,080
...men whose commitment
to change and peace...

609
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,040
...made them dangerous to men
committed to war, would follow...

610
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,720
...also killed by such lonely, crazed men.

611
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,120
Men who remove all guilt by making
murder a meaningless act of a loner.

612
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,400
We've all become Hamlets in our country,
children of a slain father-leader...

613
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,080
...whose killers still possess the throne.

614
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,720
The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us
with the secret murder...

615
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
...at the heart of the American Dream.

616
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,040
He forces on us the appalling questions:
Of what is our Constitution made?

617
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,320
What are our lives worth?

618
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,320
What is the future of a democracy...

619
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,520
...where a President can be assassinated
under suspicious circumstances...

620
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,760
...while the machinery of legal action
scarcely trembles?

621
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,360
How many more political murders
disguised as heart attacks...

622
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,880
...suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?

623
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,600
How many plane and car crashes
will occur...

624
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,880
...before they are exposed
for what they are?

625
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,320
"Treason doth never prosper",
wrote an English poet.

626
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,480
"What's the reason?"

627
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,720
"For if it prosper,
none dare call it treason."

628
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,200
The American public has yet
to see the Zapruder film.

629
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,720
Why?

630
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,840
The American public has yet to see
the real X-rays and autopsy photographs.

631
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,720
Why?

632
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,880
Hundreds of documents could help prove
this conspiracy.

633
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,920
Why are they being withheld
or burned by the government?

634
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,440
When my office or you, the people, asked
those questions, demanded evidence...

635
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,240
...the answer from on high
has always been: National security.

636
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,760
What kind of national security do we have
when we're robbed of our leaders?

637
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,200
What national security
permits the removal...

638
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,680
...of fundamental power from the people...

639
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,720
...and validates the ascendancy
of an invisible government in the US?

640
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,720
That kind of national security is...

641
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,720
...when it smells like it, feels like it,
and looks like it...

642
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,800
...you call it what it is:

643
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,760
Fascism!

644
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,080
I submit to you that what took place
on November 22, 1963...

645
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,360
...was a "coup d'état".

646
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,760
Its most direct and tragic result...

647
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,880
...was the reversal of Kennedy's decision
to withdraw from Vietnam.

648
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,440
The war is the biggest business
in America...

649
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,600
...worth $80 billion a year.

650
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,360
President Kennedy was murdered
by a conspiracy...

651
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,240
...planned at the highest levels
of our government...

652
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,840
...carried out by fanatical
and disciplined cold warriors...

653
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,280
...in the Pentagon and CIA's
covert-operation apparatus.

654
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,600
Among them, Clay Shaw, here before you.

655
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,760
It was a public execution,
and it was covered up by...

656
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,760
...like-minded people in the Dallas Police...

657
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,960
...the Secret Service, the FBI,
and the White House...

658
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,120
...up to and including J. Edgar Hoover,
and Lyndon Johnson...

659
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,000
...who were accomplices after the fact.

660
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,520
The assassination reduced the President
to a transient official.

661
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,120
His job is to speak as often as possible
of the nation's desire for peace...

662
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,840
...while he acts as a business agent
in the Congress...

663
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,520
...for the military and their contractors.

664
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,560
Some people say I'm crazy.

665
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,120
Southern caricature seeking higher office.

666
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,560
There's a simple way to determine
if I am paranoid.

667
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,480
Ask the two men who profited most
from the assassination...

668
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,400
...former President Johnson
and your new President, Nixon...

669
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,800
...to release the 51 CIA documents
pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.

670
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,560
Or the secret CIA memo...

671
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,960
...on Oswald's activities in Russia that
was destroyed while being photocopied.

672
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,320
These documents are yours.

673
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,360
The people's property. You pay for it.

674
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
But as the government sees you
as children...

675
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,320
...who might be too disturbed
to face this reality...

676
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,880
...or because you might lynch
those involved...

677
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,920
...you cannot see these documents
for another 75 years.

678
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,680
I'm in my 40s...

679
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,480
...so I'll have "shuffled off
this mortal coil" by then.

680
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,640
But I'm telling my eight-year-old son
to keep himself physically fit...

681
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,520
...so that one glorious September morning,
in 2038...

682
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,800
...he can go to the National Archives
and learn what the CIA and FBI knew.

683
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,720
They may push it back then.

684
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,880
It may become a generational affair.
Questions passed from parent to child.

685
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,680
But someday, somewhere,
someone may find out the damn truth.

686
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,840
We better.

687
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,800
Or we might just as well build ourselves
another government...

688
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,160
...like the Declaration of Independence
says to, when the old one don't work.

689
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,520
Just a bit farther out West.

690
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,760
An American naturalist wrote:

691
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,080
"A patriot must always be ready
to defend his country...

692
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,640
...against its government."

693
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,240
I'd hate to be in your shoes today.

694
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:13,000
You have a lot to think about. You've seen
evidence the public hasn't seen.

695
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,840
Going back to when we were children...

696
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,560
...I think most of us in this courtroom
thought justice came automatically.

697
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,600
That virtue was its own reward.

698
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,640
That good triumphs over evil.

699
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,280
But as we get older
we know this isn't true.

700
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,680
Individual human beings have to create
justice, and this is not easy...

701
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,040
...because the truth often poses a threat
to power...

702
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,720
...and one often has to fight power
at great risk to themselves.

703
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,120
People like S.M. Holland...

704
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,920
...Lee Bowers...

705
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,640
...Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe...

706
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,960
...have all taken that risk
and they've all come forward.

707
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,760
I have here some $8,000 in these letters...

708
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,280
...sent from all over the country.

709
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,480
Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives...

710
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,360
...plumbers, car salesmen,
teachers, invalids.

711
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,520
These are people who cannot afford
to send money but do.

712
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,800
People who drive cabs...

713
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,440
...who nurse in hospitals...

714
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,080
...who see their kids go to Vietnam.

715
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,840
Why?

716
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,920
Because they care.

717
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,600
Because they want to know the truth.

718
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,720
Because they want their country back.

719
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,120
Because it still belongs to us...

720
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,760
...as long as the people have the guts
to fight for what they believe in.

721
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,160
The truth is the most important value
we have, because if it doesn't endure...

722
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,080
...if the government murders truth...

723
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,360
...if we cannot respect these people...

724
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:50,920
...then this is not the country I was born in,
or the country I want to die in.

725
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,320
Tennyson wrote:

"Authority forgets a dying king."

727
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,680
This was never more true
than for John F. Kennedy...

728
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,440
...whose murder was probably one
of the most terrible moments...

729

...in the history of our country.

730
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,480
We, the people, the jury system sitting
in judgment on Clay Shaw...

731
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,240
...represent the hope...

732
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,920
...of humanity against government power.

733
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,360
In discharging your duty...

734
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,840
...to bring a first conviction
in this house of cards...

735
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,040
...against Clay Shaw...

736
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,040
"...ask not what your country can do for
you but what you can do for your country."

737
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,120
Do not forget...

738
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,560
...your dying king.

739
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,280
Show this world...

740
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:44,640
...this is still a government "of the people,
for the people and by the people."

741
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,400
Nothing as long as you live...

742
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,080
...will ever be more important.

743
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,440
It's up to you.

744
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,560
Has the jury reached a verdict?

745
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,840
We have, Your Honor.

746
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,880
Please hand the verdict to the clerk.

747
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,360
Will the defendant please rise?

748
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,480
The clerk will now read the verdict.

749
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,960
"New Orleans, Louisiana. March 1, 1969."

750
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,320
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Clay Shaw, not guilty."

751
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,120
We believe there was a conspiracy.

752
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,080
Whether Shaw was a part of it
is another kettle of fish.

753
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,200
There's Jim!

754
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,400
Do you agree that this is a full vindication
of the Warren Commission?

755
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,600
It only proves you cannot run
an investigation...

756
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,120
...questioning the intelligence operations
of the US government.

757
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,640
People claim you're unfit to hold office...

758
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,960
...that you've ruined
Clay Shaw's reputation.

759
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,440
Are you going to resign?

760
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,360
Hell, no! I'm going to run again,
and I'm going to win!

761
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,280
Who will you persecute next?

762
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,320
If it takes me 30 years to nail every one
of the assassins...

763
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,680
...then I will continue for 30 years!

764
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,560
I owe that to Jack Kennedy
and the country.

765
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,320
There's Clay! There's Clay Shaw!

766
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,800
- How does it feel to be acquitted?
- It's been exhausting.

767
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,000
What'll you do now?

768
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,760
I'm going home and cook some étouffée.

769
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,800
Were you confident about the outcome?

770
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,360
- Do you think Garrison will be back?
- I'm sure he will.

771
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,400
In 1979, RICHARD HELMS,
Director of Covert Operations in 1963,

772
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,280
admitted under oath
that CLAY SHAW had worked for the CIA.

773
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,360
CLAY SHAW died in 1974 of lung cancer.
No autopsy was allowed.

774
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,400
In 1978, JIM GARRISON was elected Judge
of the Louisiana State Court of Appeal

775
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,600
in New Orleans. He was re-elected in 1988.

776
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,800
To this date, he has brought the only
public prosecution in the Kennedy killing.

777
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,760
SOUTHEAST ASIA: 2 million Asian lives
lost, 58,000 American lives lost,

778
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,120
$220 billion spent, 10 million Americans
air-lifted there by commercial aircraft,

779
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,000
more than 5,000 helicopters lost,
6.5 million tons of bombs dropped.

780
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,840
A Congressional Investigation from
1976-1979 found a "probable conspiracy"

781
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,960
in the assassination of John F. Kennedy

782
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,040
and recommended
the Justice Department investigate further.

783
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,760
As of 1991, the Justice Department
has done nothing.

784
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,840
The files of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations are locked away until 2029.

785
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,760
WHAT IS PAST IS PROLOGUE

786
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,440
DEDICATED TO THE YOUNG

787
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:23,360
IN WHOSE SPIRIT
THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH MARCHES ON

788
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,160
As a result of this film, Congress in 1992
passed legislation to appoint a panel

789
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,440
to review all files and determine
which ones would be made available

790
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,760
to the American public.

791
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,000
