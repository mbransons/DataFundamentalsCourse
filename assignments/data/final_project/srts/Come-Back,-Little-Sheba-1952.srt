1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,128


2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:10,427


3
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,353
Good morning.
You've come to see the room?

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,939
Yes, I have. I'm Marie Buckholder.

5
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,860
Oh. How are you, dear?
You're from the university?

6
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,322
- Yes. I hope I didn't get you up.
- Oh, no, honey.

7
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,657
I had to get up, anyway.

8
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,621
It's up here. Is this the first room
you looked for?

9
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,415
- Yes, it is.
- I hope you like it.

10
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,419
- I'm sure I will.
- We haven't any children, you know.

11
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,464
Come right in. Right in here.

12
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,467
This is the room, honey.

13
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,886
See? You got a closet.

14
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:21,808
Nice, big closet.
And a lamp for reading.

15
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,145
I'll have to get you a bulb.

16
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:30,734
It's usually more quiet.
I guess a student needs it quiet.

17
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,488
But today being Saturday,
the Coffman kids is home.

18
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,949
The view isn't too important.

19
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,746
- It ain't too much money?
- No, the price seems all right.

20
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,123
Nice bed. A wonderful bed.

21
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,545
Good mattress.
I know, 'cause I slept here myself.

22
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,797
- You did?
- Well, not lately.

23
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:55,843
My husband used to be sickly.
But he's all right now.

24
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,346
I don't know, Mrs Delaney,
I'll think it over.

25
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,683
There isn't anything
closer to the university.

26
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,770
- It's very convenient, but...
- The bathroom's nice.

27
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,606
I just had it repainted three years ago.

28
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:14,319
We could put in another shelf
for your towels and things.

29
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,531
- And that's...
- That's our room.

30
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,200
My husband's asleep or I'd show you.

31
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,452
My husband's a doctor.

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,999
Not a real MD, a chiropractor.
But he's got a good practice.

33
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:31,670
If you was interested in the front room,
I could speak to him.

34
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,922
No, I wouldn't think of it.

35
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,635
I just started looking
and I feel I should look around a bit.

36
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:43,682
You could get your own meal.
Kitchen privileges, they call it.

37
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,435
And I could get you your own key.

38
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:50,564
You could come and go as...
That's my sewing room.

39
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:56,445
- It's a little upset now.
- I will think it over.

40
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,658
You could use the house
as if it was yours.

41
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,037
We wouldn't interfere,
'cause we're very quiet.

42
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,456
We don't have much company.

43
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:12,002
- It's only two blocks to the bus.
- Yes, it's very convenient.

44
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:17,549
- It's quite likely I will be back, only...
- I'll keep my fingers crossed.

45
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,969
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Bye.

46
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,552
- Who was that, Lola?
- Morning. I didn't hear ya.

47
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,180
You know what I just thought I saw?
Little Sheba.

48
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,100
But it was just some little grey dog.

49
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:13,313
- Who was that upstairs with you?
- She's an awful sweet little thing.

50
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,732
Her name is Marie Buckholder.

51
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,527
She's a student at the university.

52
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:22,614
I keep thinking
every little dog I see is Sheba.

53
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,619
- What did Miss Buckholder want?
- She came about renting the bedroom.

54
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,955
I called up the university.

55
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:35,294
You know, Daddy. After all, six dollars
ain't to be sneezed at.

56
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,882
- What are you thinking of?
- Lots of people rent rooms.

57
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,010
Not the Delaneys.

58
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,139
I didn't mean to upset you.
I just thought...

59
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,768
- I don't want anybody here.
- Are you mad at me?

60
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,272
You know, it ain't like before.

61
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,527
Nobody'd see you getting drunk,
'cause you don't get drunk any more.

62
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:06,074
When I remember the way you used
to be, drinking and getting into fights.

63
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,162
- Please, baby.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

64
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:15,250
You gotta understand, honey.
Sure, I know I'm fine today.

65
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,004
Today, I know I can control myself.
That's enough.

66
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,465
Oh, sure, Doc.

67
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,969
Gee, must have been after three
when you got home last night.

68
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:30,057
Where was you working?
At the jail or the hospital?

69
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,309
At the jail.

70
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,189
- Want fruit juice?
- Oh, sure. Nice and cold.

71
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,822
- You sure drink it up fast.
- You know what the doctor said.

72
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,325
I'll stock in a lot today.

73
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,620
I was sure there was still some left.

74
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:56,625
Doc, can I go with you
to the AA meeting?

75
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,294
- For your birthday party.
- Sure.

76
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,383
- Wish I had some orange juice.
- I'll go to the store.

77
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,179
- Don't bother.
- Oh, it won't take a minute.

78
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,934
- I can get some on the way to work.
- No, let me do it for you.

79
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,396
I'll be right back. Won't take a second.

80
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,535
Mrs Delaney?

81
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,795
- I'm Miss Buckholder.
- Mrs Delaney's out.

82
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:46,300
I've come about renting the room,
and not the upstairs room.

83
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:51,722
If Mrs Delaney could let me have
this one, it's really what I had in mind.

84
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,183
More a studio than a bedroom.

85
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,435
I was here a few minutes ago.

86
00:07:56,602 --> 00:08:02,107
You see, I'm studying art
and this would work out just great.

87
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:06,361
D'you think she'd consider it?
But if I'd be in your way...

88
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:11,867
- It's rather far from the bathroom.
- Running up stairs keeps my legs slim.

89
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:17,998
If I have to run in and out and it's late,
I won't be bothering you.

90
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,376
Mrs Delaney said
I could move in right away.

91
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,629
Right away?

92
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,049
Well, then... then why don't you?

93
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:31,428
- She wouldn't mind it being this room?
- It's my house.

94
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:36,725
That's just wonderful! Thank you
so much, Mr... Doctor Delaney.

95
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,357
She said two weeks in advance
was satisfactory.

96
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,944
- That can wait till later.
- No, I insist.

97
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:54,409
Tell her I'll be moving in around
four o'clock. Oh, gee, thanks so much.

98
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,745
I hope I didn't disturb you.

99
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,094
Daddy?

100
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,022
Doc?

101
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,905
Oh. Daddy, why didn't you answer me?

102
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,701
- I didn't hear you.
- I thought you'd gone.

103
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:39,663
- I rented your room.
- Did that nice girl come back?

104
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,750
Your sewing room.
You'll have to take your things out.

105
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,212
- Sure.
- There's your first two weeks' rent.

106
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,673
Oh. Thanks, Daddy.

107
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,219
The money'll come in handy.

108
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,903
Good evening.

109
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

110
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,795
May I have your attention, please?

111
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,593
Good evening. My name
is Ed Anderson, I'm an alcoholic.

112
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,304
I'm happy to welcome you to the AA.

113
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,556
Those of you who are new,

114
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:44,061
I hope you find what I found when I
walked in that door five years ago.

115
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:48,232
First, let's have
all the alcoholics raise their hands.

116
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:55,531
Thank you. Now those of you
who are here for the first time.

117
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,453
It's good to have you here.

118
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,083
Now for the birthday babies.
Elmo Chester, four years.

119
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,511
Pearl Stimson, three years.

120
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,688
Henrietta Colby, two years.

121
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,111
Doc Delaney, one year.

122
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,757
Elmo.

123
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,431
It's a long time between drinks.

124
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,730
Pearl.

125
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:19,406
Three years ago, I wouldn't have
the wind to do this.

126
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,287
Henrietta.

127
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,212
I don't know...
I don't know what to say,

128
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:37,841
except I thank God and
all my friends here who've helped me.

129
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,681
Doc.

130
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,943
- I never thought I'd make it.
- Neither did I.

131
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,498
- Hi there.
- Hello.

132
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,167
I bet I know who you're writing to.

133
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,796
I got a real long one from him today.
Four pages.

134
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:20,300
- Was it as interesting as usual?
- Especially interesting.

135
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:25,013
You hear that, Daddy?
Doc, she got a letter from Bruce.

136
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,600
- Bruce?
- As if you didn't know who that was.

137
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,062
You hear that, Marie?
The boy she's engaged to.

138
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,941
- The young man back home.
- We're not exactly engaged.

139
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:40,362
I just got my eye on him. You sound
tired, Doc. What'd you see tonight?

140
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,742
Oh, we didn't go to a movie. We...
We went to see some friends.

141
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,788
- Night.
- I'll be up in a minute, Doc.

142
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,125
Did Bruce get his raise?

143
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:58,463
He's getting $300 a month and
expenses and he gets to fly everywhere.

144
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,049
Oh, that's wonderful.

145
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,263
Well, I guess you're busy.

146
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,058
- Night, Marie.
- Good night, Mrs Delaney.

147
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,811
What about a little music?

148
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:16,106
I always think music
helps with letter writing.

149
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,420
Marie should really marry that fella.

150
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:42,549
He makes $300 a month
and he gets to fly every place.

151
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,344
Thought she wants to get an education.

152
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,640
Drawing pictures?
That's what she studies the most of.

153
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,398
Honey, do me a favour. I don't want
Marie to know about me being in AA.

154
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:04,738
But that's the first thing the AAs
teach you, to admit you're an alcoholic.

155
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,325
I'll tell everybody
when I'm more sure of myself.

156
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:13,455
You certainly ought to be sure
after tonight. I was so proud of you.

157
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:18,001
You looked so nice standing up there
in front of all those people.

158
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,174
- This too much air?
- Fine.

159
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:33,934
I'm too tired to wash my face tonight.
Did you?

160
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:39,106
She must spend a fortune
on bath powders and salts.

161
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,859
That bathroom smells like a lilac factory.

162
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,361
Oh, yeah. I like it.

163
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:04,548
I dreamt about Little Sheba again
last night, Doc.

164
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,509
- You did?
- Yes.

165
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,346
It was just as real.

166
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:15,893
I put her on a leash to take her
downtown to do some shopping.

167
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,354
Everybody on the street
turned around to look at her.

168
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,773
I was so proud.

169
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,194
Then we started to walk.

170
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,739
And the blocks started going by so fast,

171
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:32,284
poor Little Sheba
couldn't keep up with me.

172
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,871
Suddenly, I looked around
and she was gone.

173
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,124
Ain't that funny?

174
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,753
I looked everywhere for her,
but I couldn't find her.

175
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:50,093
I stood there, feeling kind of afraid.
Do you suppose that means anything?

176
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:55,891
- Daddy? Are you asleep?
- Dreams are funny.

177
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,896
Do you suppose it means
Little Sheba's gonna come back?

178
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,148
I don't know, baby.

179
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,197
I miss her so.

180
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,701
She was such a cute little puppy.

181
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,623
- Wasn't she cute?
- Yes, she was cute.

182
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:26,213
Remember how white and fluffy
she used to be after I gave her a bath?

183
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:33,011
And how her little hind end wagged
from side to side when she walked?

184
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,264
I remember.

185
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,061
I just hated to see her grow old.

186
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,731
Little Sheba should have
stayed young forever.

187
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:49,570
Some things should never grow old.
That's what it amounts to, I guess.

188
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,793
- Hi!
- Hello! How's our star boarder today?

189
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,504
- Want your breakfast?
- Just fruit juice.

190
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,507
You look lovelier than a spring garden.

191
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,635
You sure you wouldn't like a roll?

192
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:19,099
I got to get to the library, check out
some special books before anyone else.

193
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:24,229
You want to study hard, be a fine artist
someday. Paint beautiful pictures.

194
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:27,608
I remember a picture my mother had
over the mantelpiece.

195
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,068
A picture of a cathedral in a sunset.

196
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:34,281
It made you feel religious
just to look at it.

197
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,242
These books are for biology.
I have an exam.

198
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,578
- That enough?
- Fine.

199
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,830
See you later.

200
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,189
- Morning, honey.
- Morning, dear.

201
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,697
I can't sleep late like I used to.

202
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,701
I used to be able to sleep
till noon if I wanted to.

203
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,996
- I can't any more, I don't know why.
- Habits change.

204
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:27,793
Maybe it's the spring. Everything else
is stirring, why shouldn't you?

205
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,591
I should be getting your breakfast,
but you're getting mine.

206
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,930
- Did you say your prayer?
- Yes, baby.

207
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:44,685
Did you ask God to be with you
and keep you strong?

208
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,897
- Yes, baby.
- Then God'll be with you, Doccy.

209
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,239
Say your prayer for me, Daddy.
I love to hear it.

210
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:03,620
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

211
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:08,876
courage to change the things I can, and
wisdom always to know the difference.

212
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:14,882
That's so nice. That's so pretty.

213
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,428
When I think of the way
you used to be, Daddy,

214
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,514
always drinking and getting into fights.

215
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:26,852
I was always so scared.
I never knew what was gonna happen.

216
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,980
I don't know what I'd have done
without you.

217
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,859
I'm so proud of you.
You been sober over a year.

218
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:40,824
- Mr Cruthers is coming to the office.
- Oh, he said he never would.

219
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,244
It goes to show you
people are nicer than you think.

220
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:48,165
- They always give you another chance.
- Oh, sure.

221
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:56,089
Maybe... maybe you could take me
to a movie tonight?

222
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:00,511
- I have to do some Twelfth Step work.
- Again?

223
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,806
It's important. You help yourself
by helping other alcoholics.

224
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,893
Alcoholics are mostly disappointed men.

225
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,979
Oh. Sure, I know.

226
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,902
You wasn't ever disappointed,
were you, Doc?

227
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,154
The thing is not to dwell on the past,

228
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:23,408
to live each day as it comes,
and stay sober doing it.

229
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:30,374
- Who are you gonna help tonight?
- Some fellow they found on skid row.

230
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,044
He's down at the city hospital.
I kind of dread it.

231
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,296
You said it helped you.

232
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,674
It does if you can stand it.

233
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:42,511
I did some Twelfth Step work
there myself once before.

234
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:45,973
They put the alcoholics
in with the crazy people.

235
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,225
Horrible.

236
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,936
These men, all twisted and shaking.

237
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,605
Eyes all foggy and full of pain.

238
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:57,860
One fellow had his hands clamped
together so he wouldn't kill anyone.

239
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:01,405
There was a young man,
scratched his eyes out.

240
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,907
Oh, don't, Daddy.

241
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:07,452
It's awful they take 'em there,
just 'cause they get drunk.

242
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:12,249
They'll sober him up, that's the
important thing. Let's not talk about it.

243
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,960
Maybe Marie
can go to a movie with you.

244
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,589
No, she's probably going out
somewheres with Turk.

245
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,887
She shouldn't be going out
with a fellow like Turk.

246
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,973
I don't know why you say that.
Turk's nice.

247
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,310
Fellow like that has no respect
for nice, young girls.

248
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,937
I can tell just by looking at him.

249
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:39,776
You think every girl is like Jennifer
Jones in {y:i}The Song of Bernadette.

250
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,822
I like to believe that young people
like her are clean and decent.

251
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,117
- Hi.
- Hi, honey. My, you're up early.

252
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,745
- You want any breakfast?
- No, thank you.

253
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:53,207
It's such a nice morning,
why don't you walk with me?

254
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:57,753
- Yeah, Daddy, it'll do you good.
- I might come home for lunch.

255
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,756
Fine. I'll fix something hot for you.

256
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:03,759
- I hope I'm not rushing you.
- Not at all.

257
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:08,305
Have a good day. That's all right,
Daddy, you go on.

258
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,642
- Bye, you two, have fun.
- Wanna walk to the office?

259
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,604
- No, Daddy, I ain't even dressed.
- Kiss Daddy goodbye.

260
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:18,565
- Bye-bye.
- Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

261
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:22,486
- Go on, Doc.
- Can't spend time kissing all the girls.

262
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:32,287
- Can I carry those?
- They're not heavy, I can manage.

263
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,998
It would look silly, a man my age.

264
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:40,379
A lot of men your age go to school.
I guess you had your share of college.

265
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:43,507
You can always tell
when a man's educated.

266
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:46,134
And isn't that a Phi Beta Kappa key?

267
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:50,305
I found it in a drawer the other day.
You're observant, Marie.

268
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:54,726
- Where'd you go?
- Mead. Most people never heard of it.

269
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:58,063
If they know anything
about medical colleges they have.

270
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,484
It's to medicine what Harvard is to law.
I had an uncle who went there.

271
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,779
Do people usually go to Mead
to become chiropractors?

272
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:09,408
- Well, I... I didn't finish there.
- What happened?

273
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,994
Well, I... I just didn't finish.

274
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,580
You take biology? You like it?

275
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:18,917
Sure. What's more interesting than
nature, especially our own bodies?

276
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,087
Speaking of bodies, my friend Turk.

277
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,634
This is where I have to leave you.
Have a good day.

278
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,804
- Same to you, Marie.
- Hey, Turk.

279
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:36,018
- If it isn't Mrs Rembrandt.
- Got room for me on your handlebars?

280
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:46,570
- Hello, Mrs Coffman. How are you?
- Thank you, fine, Mrs Delaney.

281
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,533
You're the busiest woman I ever saw.

282
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,244
Keeping busy is keeping happy.

283
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,582
With four kids to look after,
you've got no time to sit around.

284
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,919
- No, I suppose not.
- You don't hear me complain.

285
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,671
Oh, no, you never complain.

286
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:08,300
I wouldn't, either, if I had
a little cutie like Gretchen.

287
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,594
She's such a darling.

288
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:17,017
I'm afraid my little doggy has gone
for good, Mrs Coffman. I miss her so.

289
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:21,104
The only way to keep from
missing one dog is to get another.

290
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:25,567
No, I never could find another
little doggy as cute as Little Sheba.

291
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:31,490
I put an ad in the paper
for two weeks, but nobody answered it.

292
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:36,286
It's just like she vanished.
Just vanished into thin air.

293
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,289
That was months ago, Mrs Delaney.

294
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:44,044
You should get busy and forget her.
You should get busy, Mrs Delaney.

295
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:49,716
Yeah, I'm going to. As a matter of fact,
I've got something cooking now.

296
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,010
See you later.

297
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:16,451
- Hello, Mr Postman. How are you?
- Morning.

298
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,996
You better have something for me.

299
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:23,000
Sometimes I think
you don't even know I live here.

300
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,670
It's been two weeks
since you brought me anything.

301
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:30,591
If you can't do any better,
I'll have to get a new postman.

302
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:35,804
You'll have to get someone to write you
some letters. Nothing for you.

303
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,641
I was just joking.
You knew I was joking, didn't you?

304
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:44,563
I bet you're thirsty. Come in and
I'll get you a nice, cold glass of water.

305
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,608
Come in and rest your feet for a while.

306
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:51,653
I'll take you up on that.
I've worked up quite a thirst.

307
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,740
You sit down there. I won't be a minute.

308
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,744
Won't be a minute.

309
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:05,125
Feel free to ask me for a glass of water
any time you wanna.

310
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:09,421
That's what we're here for,
to make each other comfortable.

311
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,423
Thank you, ma'am.

312
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,677
- I hope you can't taste the cantaloupe.
- Is that what it is?

313
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:18,680
- I'll get you some fresh.
- No, this is fine.

314
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:23,560
You haven't been our postman
very long, have you?

315
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,355
You postmen have things pretty nice.

316
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:31,109
I hear you get a nice pension
from the government after 20 years.

317
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:34,988
I think that's fine. It's a good job, too.

318
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,949
You may get tired,

319
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:41,662
but it's good for a man to be outdoors
and get a lot of exercise.

320
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,122
My husband is a chiropractor.

321
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:48,126
He has to stay inside his office
all day long.

322
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:52,881
The only exercise he gets
is rubbing people's backbones.

323
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:56,260
But it makes his hands
awful strong, you know.

324
00:27:56,426 --> 00:28:01,181
He's got the strongest hands
you ever saw. But a weak digestion.

325
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:04,142
- You want any more?
- No, thanks.

326
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:10,357
You know, my husband
is Alcoholics Anonymous.

327
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,485
He wouldn't mind if I told you.
He's proud of it.

328
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:16,613
He hasn't touched a drop in over a year.

329
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,827
All that time, we've had a bottle of
whisky in the kitchen. Just for company.

330
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:25,205
He hasn't even gone near it.
Doesn't even want to.

331
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:30,335
Alcoholics can't drink like
ordinary people. They're allergic to it.

332
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:35,299
They start drinking and they can't stop.
Liquor transforms them.

333
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:38,844
But if they leave liquor alone,
they're perfectly all right.

334
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,138
They're just like you and me.

335
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:44,683
You should've seen Doc
before he gave it up. He was awful.

336
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,312
He lost all his patients,
he didn't wanna go to the office.

337
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:52,274
He just wanted
to stay drunk all day long.

338
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:56,778
You wouldn't believe it now.
He's got all his patients back.

339
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,573
- He's doing just fine.
- I know Dr Delaney.

340
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,285
I deliver mail to his office.
He's a very fine man.

341
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,955
- You don't drink, do you?
- Just a few beers once in a while.

342
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:10,125
I don't think that stuff
is good for anybody.

343
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,963
- You got any kids?
- I got three grandchildren.

344
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:20,427
We don't have any and we get these
toys in our boxes of breakfast foods.

345
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:24,556
I usually save them
for the Coffman kids, but you take it.

346
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,935
- That's very kind of you.
- That's all right.

347
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,854
Goodbye, Mr Postman.

348
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:34,733
You're gonna get a letter
if I have to write it myself.

349
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,403
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

350
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,135
{y:i}Taboo.

351
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:08,809
{y:i}It's Taboo, radio listeners,
{y:i}your 15 minutes of temptation.

352
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,316
{y:i}Won't you join me?

353
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:19,111
{y:i}Won't you leave behind your routine,

354
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,031
{y:i}the dull cares that make up
{y:i}your day-to-day existence,

355
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:26,201
{y:i}the little worries, the uncertainties,

356
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:29,496
{y:i}the confusions
{y:i}of the workaday world?

357
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:34,042
{y:i}Follow me where pagan spirits
{y:i}hold sway,

358
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:38,463
{y:i}where lithe natives dance
{y:i}on a moon-enchanted isle,

359
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,801
{y:i}where palm trees sway
{y:i}with the restless ocean tide.

360
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:48,891
{y:i}Restless, surging on the white shore.
{y:i}Won't you come along?

361
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:56,732
{y:i}But remember... it's taboo.

362
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,583
I hope we're not disturbing her.

363
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,505
I didn't hear you come in,
I was half asleep.

364
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:23,091
I brought Turk home
to pose for me. In there.

365
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,137
- Pose?
- For my poster for the spring relays.

366
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:31,892
I have to do it for life class.
I had to grab him when I could.

367
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,603
Lucky I got my track pants on.

368
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,941
- What's he gonna do?
- Strip. Down to like this.

369
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:42,152
I thought you meant
he was gonna pose naked.

370
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,404
Men models seldom do.

371
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:48,408
- Is Turk a model?
- Lots of college athletes pose for us.

372
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,119
They like to be stared at, I guess.

373
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:58,585
The women pose naked
and the men don't?

374
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,838
Men are more proper.

375
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:04,591
If it's all right for a woman,
it oughta be for a man.

376
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,719
The man always
keeps covered. Ready?

377
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,389
- Is this all right?
- Over here, please.

378
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:13,016
It'll be tough not holding a javelin.

379
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:15,310
- What about the broom?
- I'll manage.

380
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,647
- It'll be just the thing.
- Is she always around?

381
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:22,192
She's not so bad.
Look, I want your left foot here.

382
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,946
- I'd rather have you pose for me.
- Ain't that good, Marie?

383
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,824
- That's fine.
- Nice of you to trouble yourself.

384
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,076
I'm glad to help.

385
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,708
What about a little music?

386
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,931
That's nice, Marie.

387
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:57,853
That's real artistic. I wish I was artistic.

388
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:12,284
I'll get you something cold to drink.

389
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,871
- She makes me feel undressed.
- Aren't you?

390
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:20,250
- Ain't she seen a man before?
- Not a big, beautiful man like you.

391
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:23,545
You know, you're gonna
get yourself into trouble.

392
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,297
Get back.

393
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:27,549
Hello, Dr Delaney.

394
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,345
You know Turk Fisher, a classmate.

395
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,597
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hiya, Doc, what's up?

396
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:37,976
- Marie's doing a drawing.
- I'm entering the poster competition.

397
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:41,188
Lunch ain't ready,
but it won't take a minute.

398
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:43,774
Here. Make yourselves at home.

399
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,861
Cottage cheese and buttermilk.

400
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,113
- How does that sound?
- Fine.

401
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,536
What happened to his clothes?

402
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:59,706
Marie's doing a drawing
for her life class, Daddy.

403
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,543
Why doesn't she draw him
in his clothes?

404
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:06,296
It's not the same, Doc.
You see, this is a life class.

405
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:08,549
They just draw bodies.

406
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,134
They all do it in the classroom.

407
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,930
It's not right. I don't care
if they do teach it at college.

408
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,391
Marie shouldn't do things like that.

409
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:22,396
But he's just posing for her.
Marie says lots of the athletes do it.

410
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:27,317
They fuss because they haven't
any children. They had one who died.

411
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:32,281
I can think of more interesting subjects
than them.

412
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,659
- You asked.
- I just meant he didn't care for me.

413
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:40,664
Doc is sort of tense. He used to be sick.
And getting old is no fun, I guess.

414
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:43,166
Yeah. Our age is the time.

415
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,503
- You said it.
- We don't want to waste any of it.

416
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,965
Turk, just hold that pose.
I'm almost finished.

417
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:54,469
Why doesn't she draw something else?
Flowers, a cathedral, a sunset?

418
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:58,765
All I know is Marie says if she does
a good drawing of Turk,

419
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:02,477
they'll use it for the posters
in the spring relays.

420
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:05,397
So I guess they don't want sunsets.

421
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:10,986
Suppose somebody walked in.
What would they think?

422
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:16,366
Well, if you think it's wrong, Daddy,
I won't let them do it again.

423
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:19,578
- I just don't like it.
- I don't see any harm in it.

424
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:24,124
- No harm? She's engaged, isn't she?
- Well, it ain't set yet.

425
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:29,338
All right. If anything happens
to that girl, I'll never forgive you.

426
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:48,273
- Mrs Delaney.
- Who cares about her?

427
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,391
- I'll get it.
- Yes, it's probably for you, Daddy.

428
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,522
Hello? I'll call her.

429
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:31,692
- Who is it?
- It's for Marie.

430
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,778
- Yeah, but who is it?
- Marie, telephone.

431
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:37,030
Thanks.

432
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:40,158
Hello? Oh, hi.

433
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:44,496
Aren't we the big shot now?
Nice record you chalked up today.

434
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:48,166
- Turk was the star of the track meet.
- Oh, Turk!

435
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,920
I'm getting ready now. I'll be waiting.
OK.

436
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:56,300
- Where you going?
- Dance and whatnot.

437
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:05,559
I used to be popular, wasn't I, Doc?

438
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:27,623
Remember the homecoming dance,

439
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:31,502
when Charlie Kettlecamp and I
won the charleston contest?

440
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:37,925
Remember how mad you was when
he thought he ought to bring me home?

441
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:41,470
- I did not get mad.
- Oh, yes, you did.

442
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:48,143
Charlie was all right.
You was just jealous.

443
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:53,148
- I was not jealous.
- Yes, you were, Doc.

444
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:58,070
You got jealous when we went anyplace
if I even looked at another boy.

445
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:02,074
There was nothing between Charlie
and me. There never was.

446
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,576
Honey, I'm trying to read.

447
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,418
Are you hungry? Hungry?

448
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:22,636
Lots of other boys
called me up for dates.

449
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,888
Sammy Knight.

450
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,225
Hank Biederman.

451
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,772
- Dutch McCoy.
- Sure, baby, you were the It girl.

452
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:37,359
But I saved all my dates for you,
didn't I, Daddy?

453
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:40,696
- As far as I know.
- Doc, I did.

454
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:45,075
You know I did. I never had a date
with any other boy but you.

455
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:48,203
That was a long time ago.
It's all forgotten.

456
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:53,208
Doc, how can you say that? Those were
the happiest times of our lives.

457
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,460
I'll never forget them.

458
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,963
I'll never forget that spring.

459
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,801
It was such a nice spring.
The trees were so full and so green.

460
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,596
And the air smelled so sweet.

461
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:11,059
Remember the walks we took
down by the old chapel?

462
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,604
It was so quiet and still.

463
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,441
That was such a nice spring.

464
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:22,112
In spring, a young man's fancy turns...
pretty fancy.

465
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,200
I was pretty then, wasn't I, Doc?

466
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:30,120
Remember the first time
you kissed me?

467
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:34,208
You were scared as a young girl.
You trembled so.

468
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,128
We'd been going together
almost a year.

469
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:40,839
And you'd always been so shy.

470
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:45,177
That night, for the first time,
you grabbed me and kissed me.

471
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:49,515
There was tears in your eyes, Doc.

472
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:53,477
You said you'd love me
forever and ever. Remember?

473
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:57,439
You said if I didn't marry you,
you just wanted to die.

474
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:02,486
I remember because it scared me
to have anybody say anything like that.

475
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:04,738
Yes, baby.

476
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:10,244
Then, when it got dark,
we stretched out on the cool grass.

477
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:14,039
You kissed me all night long.

478
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:18,252
You've got to forget those things.
It was 20 years ago.

479
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,214
Those years have vanished.

480
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,428
Just vanished into thin air.

481
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:34,935
Maybe you're sorry
you married me now, Doc.

482
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:38,856
You didn't know I was gonna
get old and fat and sloppy.

483
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:43,277
- Oh, baby...
- It's the truth. That's what I am.

484
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:49,074
But I didn't know it either.
Are you sorry you married me?

485
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:55,080
- Of course not.
- Are you sorry you had to marry me?

486
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:59,793
We were never gonna
talk about that, baby.

487
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:08,719
But, Doc... you was the only one.

488
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:13,724
- I'd just die if you didn't believe that.
- I know.

489
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,976
You were so nice and proper,

490
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:21,231
I never thought anything we did together
would be wrong or make us unhappy.

491
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,692
Do you think we did wrong?

492
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:27,988
You can't defy convention.
Or the laws of God.

493
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,825
I don't think anybody ever knew
except my folks.

494
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:38,165
If the baby had lived,
everyone would have known.

495
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:43,295
My losing her, the way it turned out,
you wouldn't have had to marry me.

496
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:46,173
Honey, what's done is done.

497
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,592
But it must make you feel bad

498
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:53,013
to think you had to give up your studies
and support a wife.

499
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,933
You might have been a real MD today.

500
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:03,982
- Marie, don't keep me waiting.
- Will I need a coat?

501
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,401
No, you got me.

502
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,962
If the baby'd lived,
she'd be just like Marie.

503
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:29,174
We'd be watching her go on dates.

504
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:34,304
Lola, people have got to forget the past
and live for the present.

505
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:37,099
We all make mistakes.

506
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:40,102
When my family left me all that money,

507
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:44,690
I could have gone back and finished,
instead of drinking it all up.

508
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:48,694
We could have had a nice house,
friends, comforts.

509
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:54,658
Maybe we could have adopted a family,
since you couldn't have any more.

510
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:58,495
We don't have any of those things.
So what?

511
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:00,747
We gotta keep living, don't we?

512
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:05,127
I can't give up just because I made
a few mistakes, I gotta keep going.

513
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,047
Sure, Doc. I know.

514
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:16,972
I'd better get ready.

515
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:22,102
I'll walk down to the corner
with you, Daddy.

516
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:26,398
Ed Anderson's picking me up.

517
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:28,734
Are you gonna be late tonight?

518
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:33,530
I don't know. Saturday's a bad night
at the hospital. Don't wait up for me.

519
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:45,751
- Take it easy.
- Hi, Doc.

520
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:06,480
Little Sheba.

521
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:10,943
Come, Little Sheba, come back.

522
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:15,030
Come back, Little Sheba.

523
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:20,244
I remember being taken to this hospital

524
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,705
in a padded limousine and a straitjacket.

525
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:26,250
I should think you'd try to forget it.

526
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:29,837
If you talk about it enough,
you do forget, so they tell me.

527
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:32,798
No good burying it or being ashamed.

528
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:36,844
I'm going in under my own steam now,
that's what's important.

529
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,680
I was never violent. I had quiet DTs.

530
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:43,267
The noises were made by
the caterpillars on the wall

531
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:46,687
while I waited
for them to turn into butterflies.

532
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:07,875
What's the matter, Doc?
It's no picnic, but you get used to it.

533
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,513
- Looks like we're having company.
- Yeah.

534
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,476
Bruce is coming tomorrow night.
I'm gonna ask him to dinner.

535
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:30,522
- Marie know about it?
- Yeah. She was real pleased.

536
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:33,817
She said she thought it was
very thoughtful of me.

537
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,073
Gotta take this polish back
to Mrs Coffman.

538
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:46,205
- I'm pooped.
- Don't use that word, it sounds vulgar.

539
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:50,209
I hear Marie say it all the time.
I thought it was cute.

540
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:53,462
Marie doesn't say it,
her language is refined.

541
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:57,841
Well, Turk, then. Somebody.

542
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:02,137
- Marie studying?
- No, she went out.

543
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:04,389
I didn't hear her.

544
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,943
Let's get some peppy music.

545
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,827
I love peppy music.

546
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:29,957
I guess it's 'cause I used to be
such a good dancer. Wasn't I?

547
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:34,920
- Doc, let's dance.
- Oh, no, dear.

548
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:38,882
Come on, Daddy, you used to be
a good dancer.

549
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:51,186
We oughta go dancing all the time, Doc.

550
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:54,815
If we did, maybe I'd lose
some of this fat.

551
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,208
I remember when I could dance like this
all night and never notice it.

552
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:21,008
Remember the charleston?
That used to be my specialty.

553
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:34,730
- Hey, not bad.
- The place is jumping.

554
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:41,111
- You gonna study?
- If it's still all right.

555
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:43,155
Oh, sure.

556
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:49,703
Marie said she couldn't go out tonight,
so I said she could use the parlour.

557
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:55,000
Turk's going to help with my chemistry.
Oh, you don't have to leave.

558
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:58,420
- I have to go out anyway.
- Oh, you do?

559
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:02,466
I have a meeting. I won't be late.
That's Marie's scarf.

560
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:07,471
- I borrowed your scarf, honey.
- That's all right. Sit down, Turk.

561
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:10,766
Sure is nice of you,
letting us take over like this.

562
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:13,810
I gotta make hay
while she's still smiling at me.

563
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,313
Make yourselves at home.

564
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:34,748
- I wish they'd both go out.
- You don't sound much reformed.

565
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:37,793
Well, you gave me the "go" signal.

566
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,129
I know you women
gotta pretend to be offended.

567
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:45,259
- But when you come back for more...
- I'll slap your face.

568
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:48,345
Now, you gonna study or not?

569
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:53,058
I am studying.

570
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:59,022
- Is there anything wrong, Doc?
- If you don't know, I can't tell you.

571
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:02,359
You like him, but he's no good.

572
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:05,529
Marie's innocent, she doesn't
understand guys like him.

573
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:10,117
- I ought to run him out of the house.
- You wouldn't do that.

574
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:15,789
They always behave so nice, Doc.
I know, I watch them.

575
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:22,838
- What do you mean, you watch them?
- Well, I let them use the parlour.

576
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,882
You watch them?

577
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:30,220
You watch young people making love
in the movies. That's not wrong.

578
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:34,141
They're so sweet and nice,
why shouldn't I watch 'em?

579
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,852
I think it's the sweetest time in life.

580
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,438
Makes me feel young to watch 'em.

581
00:49:39,605 --> 00:49:41,773
He's too coarse for her.

582
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,153
Why don't you talk to her, Daddy,
talk to her like a father?

583
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,697
- I couldn't do that.
- It'll be all right.

584
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:53,243
Bruce will be here soon
and Turk won't be around any more.

585
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:56,580
Night, Daddy.

586
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:06,381
- Have a nice evening, Dr Delaney.
- Thanks.

587
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,681
- He hates my guts.
- He does not.

588
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:18,560
- He does. If you ask me, he's jealous.
- Jealous?

589
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:21,230
Yeah, I think he has a crush on you.

590
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:24,066
Turk, don't be silly. Doc's nice to me.

591
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:29,029
It's just little things he does, like fixing
my breakfast. He's nice to everyone.

592
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:32,741
- He ever make a pass?
- No, Doc'd never get fresh.

593
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:35,953
- He'd better not.
- Turk, don't be ridiculous.

594
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,205
Doc's a real nice, quiet man.

595
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:42,292
If he likes running his fingers
through my hair, well, why not?

596
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:45,754
He's got a wife of his own.
Let him make passes at her.

597
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:48,590
Things like that
are none of our business.

598
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:50,926
OK, how about a snuggle?

599
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:54,221
- Not tonight.
- Why is tonight different?

600
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:58,892
We should make it a rule
every once in a while to just sit and talk.

601
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,817
OK.

602
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,657
What'll we talk about?

603
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:16,368
- There's lots of things.
- OK, start in.

604
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:19,454
A person doesn't start
a conversation that way.

605
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,874
Start it any way you want to.

606
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,920
Two people should have something
to talk about, like... philosophy

607
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,882
or politics, religion.

608
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,134
- How about sex?
- Turk!

609
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:37,931
You wanted to talk about something.
I was trying to please. Let's have a kiss.

610
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,684
- Not tonight.
- Who are you saving it for?

611
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:45,814
- Don't talk like that.
- Well, thanks for a nice evening.

612
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:49,151
- Where are you going?
- I'm a man of action, baby.

613
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:52,821
- Don't go.
- Why not? I'm not doing any good here.

614
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:57,159
Don't go.

615
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,290
Why didn't you think about this before?
Come on.

616
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:06,585
- Let's get to work.
- This is all we ever do.

617
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:09,546
- Are you complaining?
- No.

618
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:12,966
- Then why put up such a front?
- It's not a front.

619
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,303
What else is it?
"Oh, no, Turk. Not tonight, Turk.

620
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,014
"I wanna talk about philosophy, Turk."

621
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:22,601
If I went out of here without trying,
you'd be sore.

622
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:25,062
- Oh, Turk.
- It's true.

623
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:28,857
- Maybe.
- How about tonight, baby?

624
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:31,652
- What about Mrs Delaney?
- What about her?

625
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:36,406
- Women sense those things.
- She ever say anything?

626
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:39,159
- No.
- You're imagining things.

627
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:41,411
- Maybe.
- Stop it.

628
00:52:45,082 --> 00:52:47,251
I know I treat you kind of rough.

629
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:52,297
I never was very gentlemanly, but...
you really don't mind it, do you?

630
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:55,592
- You know I'm nuts about you.
- Are you?

631
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:00,514
Miss Buckholder, what's your opinion

632
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:04,268
of the psychodynamic pressure
of living in the atomic age?

633
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:06,854
Turk, don't make fun of me.

634
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,063
Tonight?

635
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,691
OK.

636
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:04,536
Let's go and have a few beers.
Come back here when they're asleep.

637
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,649
You're wearing me down.

638
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:40,989
- Who are you showing off for?
- That blonde. She's drooling at me.

639
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:44,326
If I didn't know you so well
I might drool, too.

640
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:52,751
What time is it, d'you think?

641
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:55,379
Time for the old folks to be in bed.

642
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:04,680
- Come on, let's get going.
- You're awfully fresh.

643
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:52,853
Why here, half a block away?

644
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,982
I might be leaving late.
No sense in waking the Delaneys.

645
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:25,594
- I forgot my key.
- That's a good excuse. Let me see.

646
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,722
Turk, stop it.

647
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:33,685
OK, we'll both stay out here, then.
Suits me.

648
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:40,025
- No comfy porch swing?
- You're becoming a nuisance.

649
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:44,446
Since when have I changed?
You recognised my type at first glance.

650
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:48,242
- Let me see your key.
- Go ahead, look.

651
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:54,540
I told you I didn't have it.

652
00:57:00,379 --> 00:57:02,464
Don't you dare.

653
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:16,478
"Come in," said the spider to the fly.
You'd look cute, climbing in windows.

654
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:29,449
- Isn't it fun doing things you shouldn't?
- Not here.

655
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:33,745
Cut the conversation.
You want somebody to hear us?

656
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:07,696
The Delaneys'll hear us.
Give a girl a chance to breathe.

657
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:13,577
- Who's the guy?
- Bruce. He wants to marry me.

658
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:16,872
- Can he kiss like I can?
- Better. He's perfect.

659
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,834
- He's in love with me.
- So he's there and I'm here.

660
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:27,466
- He'll be here tomorrow.
- What are you trying to pull?

661
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:32,012
You dames are always playing
one of us against the other.

662
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:34,264
I don't want to fight.

663
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:39,478
Turk, I won't!

664
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:47,236
OK. But don't you come teasing
around me any more.

665
01:01:41,493 --> 01:01:44,830
Marie? Will you help me
move the table?

666
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:47,082
Oh, sure.

667
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:50,502
We have more room this way.

668
01:01:52,254 --> 01:01:54,339
Little early to be doing this.

669
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:56,592
I like to set the table early

670
01:01:56,758 --> 01:02:00,762
and spend the rest of the day
looking at it. Oh, the cups.

671
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:03,265
- You feeling better?
- Fine.

672
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:05,517
That's good.

673
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,688
Marie, d'you know what
I'm gonna have for dinner?

674
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:13,192
- No, what?
- I was awake half the night planning it.

675
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:17,321
We're gonna have stuffed pork chops,
twice-baked potatoes

676
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:19,573
and a big chocolate cake.

677
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,618
- And tomato juice.
- Sounds perfect.

678
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:26,038
Look at this tablecloth. Irish linen.

679
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:28,582
Doc's mother gave it to us.

680
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,710
- It's lovely.
- The china's real Haviland.

681
01:02:31,877 --> 01:02:33,962
- Beautiful.
- Doc's awful proud of it.

682
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:37,216
- Anything his mother gave him.
- A real mama's boy.

683
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:41,595
He was the only child and she thought
the sun rose and set in him.

684
01:02:41,762 --> 01:02:46,266
- What were your parents like?
- My father was awful strict.

685
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:50,646
He didn't let me go out with boys,
on account of I was so pretty.

686
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:53,941
Once, he caught me holding hands
with Dutch McCoy.

687
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:56,902
He wouldn't let me out for a month.

688
01:02:57,069 --> 01:03:01,532
- He didn't even want me to marry Doc.
- Why? Doc's such a gentleman.

689
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:07,037
My dad was just... Well, I guess it was
because I was so young.

690
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:11,291
Doc and I moved to the city
and I never went back again.

691
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:14,253
But my mother comes to see me.

692
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:17,798
- I have to get to class.
- Where's the baking soda?

693
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:20,759
- Just a minute.
- I'll get it for him.

694
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:24,847
I'm sorry you don't feel good.

695
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:29,560
- I'll fix it.
- No, it's no bother.

696
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:31,812
I'm glad to do it for you.

697
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:39,736
There, that'll perk you up.

698
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:48,764
- Oh. You going so soon, Doc?
- Yes.

699
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:51,475
Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

700
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:56,605
Get home early, we want to
give Bruce a royal welcome.

701
01:04:56,772 --> 01:05:01,151
- You feeling all right?
- Doc, I'll walk to the corner with you.

702
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,155
- I'm late.
- Bye, Daddy.

703
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:14,456
That's funny. I wonder why
Doc took his raincoat.

704
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,708
It's a beautiful day.

705
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:19,378
There isn't a cloud in sight.

706
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:31,056
I've never seen such activity.
What got into you?

707
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:35,602
Company's coming. Look at your lilacs,
don't they look nice?

708
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:41,316
Beautiful. My, and you did your
spring house-cleaning all in one day.

709
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,820
I certainly have to hand it to you.

710
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:49,157
All these years, I've said to myself,
"Mrs Delaney is a good-for-nothing.

711
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:53,495
"Sits around the house all day,
never even shakes a dust mop."

712
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:57,499
It just goes to show
you can never tell about people.

713
01:05:57,666 --> 01:05:59,918
- Candy?
- Thank you, no.

714
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:05,382
- Your dinner smells good.
- Pork chops and twice-baked potatoes.

715
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:08,552
That reminds me,
my kids must be hungry.

716
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:11,930
- Nice.
- Doc's favourite.

717
01:06:13,473 --> 01:06:17,853
I forgot to return your silver polish.
Thanks for lending it to me.

718
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,814
- Have a nice evening.
- Thanks.

719
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:23,066
- Night.
- Good night.

720
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:25,527
Mrs Delaney?

721
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:30,574
Mrs Delaney.

722
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:33,202
- Yeah?
- Would you help me?

723
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:38,290
You and Doc won't mind if we eat and
run? Bruce will want to take me out.

724
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:41,793
That's all right, honey.
We understand perfectly.

725
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,506
- Thanks a lot.
- That's a beautiful dress.

726
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:48,967
- You never wore that before.
- I know my man.

727
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:53,680
- Are you gonna marry Bruce?
- I am. I made up my mind last night.

728
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:57,684
- I feel kinda sorry for Turk.
- He may be sore for a while.

729
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:02,189
- But he has other girls. He'll get over it.
- Won't he feel bad?

730
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:06,944
He's had his eye on a pretty girl
in his history class for a long time.

731
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:11,281
- He's just not the marrying kind.
- Oh. Really?

732
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:14,535
Oh, Bruce!

733
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:18,247
- You want me to open the door?
- I'll get it.

734
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:29,466
- Can't you get out of it?
- Not without hurting her feelings.

735
01:07:29,633 --> 01:07:32,678
If we have to eat with them,
I'd rather take them out.

736
01:07:32,845 --> 01:07:36,431
- And not be able to get rid of them?
- Who's clever now?

737
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,519
Hello there.

738
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:43,730
Mrs Delaney, this is Bruce. Finally.

739
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:46,358
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

740
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:52,573
Marie was so excited about
your coming. I bet you're hungry.

741
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:55,993
Marie says very nice things
about you in her letters.

742
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,120
Go right in, honey.

743
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:00,998
Mrs Delaney has fixed
the grandest dinner.

744
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:05,460
That was to be my treat. I thought we
could all go to my hotel and celebrate.

745
01:08:05,627 --> 01:08:09,673
- Have a few cocktails.
- We can have cocktails here.

746
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,177
- I'll get them.
- She even cleaned the house for you.

747
01:08:58,138 --> 01:09:00,224
- Marie.
- Yes?

748
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:03,310
We'll have to go ahead without Doc.

749
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:08,190
- What's the matter with Doc?
- He got held up at the office.

750
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,360
It would be when I needed him most.

751
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:14,655
- Sure you don't need help?
- No, everything's ready.

752
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:18,951
- Marie, you sit here, honey.
- Thank you.

753
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:22,663
- Bruce, will you sit here?
- Thank you.

754
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:26,416
Three's a crowd, so I'm just gonna
serve you lovebirds.

755
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,669
- There's no hurry.
- Oh, sure.

756
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:31,463
Gotta start, 'cause the food will all spoil.

757
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,715
Let's have some candles.

758
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:36,426
- Let me do that.
- Thanks, Bruce.

759
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:39,513
I always think candlelight's so romantic.

760
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:45,102
If you'll just excuse me.
Just a minute.

761
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:57,072
Hello.

762
01:09:57,239 --> 01:10:00,951
Oh, Ed. Have you seen Doc?

763
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:05,581
He went out this morning
and he isn't home yet.

764
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:08,542
We're having company for dinner.

765
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:14,798
No, but you know that bottle of whisky
we had in the kitchen all this time?

766
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:17,259
Well, Doc's never gone near it.

767
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:20,554
I was gonna make drinks
for the company

768
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:23,182
and I went to get it and it was gone.

769
01:10:25,142 --> 01:10:27,853
No. I don't think so.

770
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:35,235
Oh. He said this morning
his stomach was kind of upset.

771
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:39,156
Would... would you, Ed?

772
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,742
Thanks, Ed. Thanks a million times.

773
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:44,912
Yes, I'll be here.

774
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:12,105
I'm afraid it's a little late for cocktails.
But tomato juice is real good for you.

775
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:15,108
I'm high already, getting my girl back.

776
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:19,071
- Sure you won't eat with us?
- I'm not a bit hungry.

777
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:21,323
Well...

778
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:26,119
What about a little music?

779
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:01,256
Oh, Ed, it's Mrs Delaney again.

780
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:05,302
I hated to call so early, but I just had to.

781
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:07,554
Did you find Doc?

782
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:11,266
No. No, he hasn't.

783
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:17,898
He probably won't come home until he's
had all he can drink and wants to sleep.

784
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:23,904
I don't know what else
to think, Ed. I'm scared.

785
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:27,866
I'm awfully scared.

786
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:32,454
If I need you later on,
will you come over?

787
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:37,167
Thanks.

788
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:32,449
Doc!

789
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,915
Are you all right, Daddy?

790
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:44,962
Where's the morning paper?
I want to see the paper.

791
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:49,007
We don't get any morning paper,
you know that.

792
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:53,345
Then I suppose I'm drunk.
Is that what you're trying to say?

793
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:56,765
- No, Daddy.
- Then get me the morning paper.

794
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:59,017
Sure, Doc.

795
01:16:01,812 --> 01:16:03,981
Here we are.

796
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:09,611
- Now, you sit right there and be quiet.
- Why shouldn't I be quiet?

797
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:12,698
- Nothing, Doc.
- "Nothing, Doc."

798
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:19,788
- Doc? You're sure you're all right?
- Course I'm all right.

799
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:25,043
Doc, where've you been?

800
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:30,632
What business is it of yours
where I've been?

801
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:36,430
- Daddy, I...
- Just let me alone, that's all I ask.

802
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:46,815
Why did you do it?
You said you'd be home early

803
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:50,611
and I had a nice dinner fixed
for Bruce and you never came.

804
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:56,158
- Bruce. A big dinner for Bruce.
- But it was for you, too.

805
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:59,703
- Well, I don't want it.
- Daddy, don't get mad.

806
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:04,958
Where's Marie?

807
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:11,757
I don't know. She didn't come home
last night. She went out with Bruce.

808
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:16,094
I suppose you peeked through
the keyhole and applauded.

809
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:21,350
Daddy, don't say things like that. He's
a nice boy. They're going to be married.

810
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:23,602
Probably has to marry her.

811
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:27,105
Just 'cause she's pretty
and he got amorous one day.

812
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:30,817
- Like I had to marry you.
- Don't, Daddy.

813
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:33,487
You and Marie are a couple of sluts.

814
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:38,367
- Daddy, please don't talk like that.
- What are you good for?

815
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:42,829
- You can't even cook my breakfast.
- I will, Doc, I will.

816
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:47,918
You don't sweep the floors till some
bozo comes and makes love to Marie.

817
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:51,505
Then you fix things up like...
like Buckingham Palace.

818
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:57,511
Or a Chinese joint,
with perfume on the lamp bulbs.

819
01:17:57,678 --> 01:18:00,472
And flowers. And china.

820
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:03,892
Gold-rimmed china.

821
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:08,230
China my mother gave us.

822
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:13,485
My mother didn't buy these
for sluts to eat off!

823
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:18,532
- Oh, Doc!
- Gonna get me a drink.

824
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:22,077
No, please don't!
Daddy, please don't!

825
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:26,498
- You stay away from me.
- Doc, you know what it does to you.

826
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:30,127
Makes me want to come home
and look at you, you...

827
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,058
Soon I'm gonna have another.
And another.

828
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:48,562
Ed, Ed, he's home.
Can you come over, Ed?

829
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:53,442
- He's drinking. I don't know what to do!
- Get away from that phone!

830
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:55,986
Please come. He's got a knife!

831
01:18:56,862 --> 01:19:00,157
No! Daddy!
No. No, Doc. Please, Daddy.

832
01:19:00,324 --> 01:19:04,077
That's right,
tell the whole world that I'm drunk.

833
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:09,541
Scream, you fat slut! Holler
so the neighbours think I've beaten you.

834
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:13,754
Where's Bruce now?
Under Marie's bed?

835
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:16,131
Got all pretty for him, didn't you?

836
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:20,302
Combed your hair. Even washed
your neck and put on a girdle.

837
01:19:20,469 --> 01:19:23,680
Please don't talk like that.
I'd rather you hit me.

838
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:27,518
I can't bear you to say
things like that. Talking crazy!

839
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:30,270
I'm making sense for the first time ever!

840
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:34,608
Didn't think I knew about it, did you?
I heard 'em sneaking in.

841
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:38,779
I saw them! You thought you
were putting something over on me.

842
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:41,532
No, Doc, I didn't know anything about it.

843
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:46,578
You're crazy if you think I didn't know!
Running a regular Ionely-hearts place.

844
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:50,874
- Probably since we were married.
- No, it's not true!

845
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:54,670
- You're lying!
- No, Daddy! Daddy, please!

846
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:58,632
That's not gonna happen any more.
I'm gonna fix you.

847
01:19:58,799 --> 01:20:02,386
- Once and for all!
- No! Don't do this to me!

848
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:06,890
Daddy! It's me, Lola!

849
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:31,415
What's going on? I heard...

850
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:37,880
- Are you all right, lady?
- Yes, I'm fine.

851
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:42,217
Some men will be here soon.
Everything will be all right.

852
01:20:46,305 --> 01:20:48,891
We got here as soon as we could.

853
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:52,853
- Tried to use that on you?
- I'm all right.

854
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,815
We can't leave him here
if he's playing with knives.

855
01:21:04,031 --> 01:21:07,993
Doc, it's Ed and Elmo.
We're gonna take care of you.

856
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:14,833
- Get off me.
- How much has he had?

857
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,713
- I don't know. He hasn't been home.
- It's hit him hard.

858
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,967
- Shall I get him some coffee?
- No, he's past that.

859
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:28,222
- Get out. This is my house.
- We're taking you with us.

860
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:31,141
- Where are you taking him?
- City hospital.

861
01:21:31,308 --> 01:21:36,939
No! No, wait, don't take me there.
That's where they put the crazy people.

862
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:40,567
If you don't come peacefully,
we'll call the cops.

863
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:45,197
You'll have to wear this off in the cooler.
You wouldn't like that.

864
01:21:45,364 --> 01:21:47,533
OK. OK, I'll go.

865
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:51,161
Just give me one more drink. Please.

866
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:55,207
- Please don't.
- Can't make much difference now.

867
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:58,043
OK, Doc, we're gonna give you a drink.

868
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:10,681
Take a good one. It's gonna be your last
for a long, long time.

869
01:22:14,226 --> 01:22:18,564
He'll be there a few days,
then he'll be home, good as new.

870
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:27,030
OK. I'm all right.

871
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:30,617
It's all right.

872
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:35,581
Honey, stop them!
Don't let them take me!

873
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:38,667
Stop them, somebody! Please!

874
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:41,879
No! No, wait! Wait, Ed!

875
01:22:42,921 --> 01:22:45,924
- Don't, Mrs Delaney.
- I want to go with him!

876
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:49,344
No, lady, that's no place for you.

877
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:53,348
You'll only be in the way.

878
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:04,234
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No, I guess not.

879
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:08,447
Keep busy, Mrs Delaney.
Keep busy and forget it.

880
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:13,493
Yes. I'm gonna keep busy, Mrs Coffman.

881
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:17,122
Look at this mess.

882
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:20,334
And he'd been behaving so long.

883
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:24,755
I'll get it.

884
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:31,678
Hello? Yes.

885
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:35,182
Mrs Delaney, I'll get it.

886
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:38,810
A telegram from
Mr and Mrs Bruce Cunningham.

887
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,859
Yes, yes, I am listening.
Married tonight. Yes.

888
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:48,862
Mrs Delaney, you mustn't.

889
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:52,241
Thanks. Send it over later.

890
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:06,171
Delaney.

891
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:10,509
Is he all right, Ed? I had to come.
He gets scared without me.

892
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:12,761
- This is Mrs Delaney.
- Ma'am.

893
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,389
- Can I see him?
- You can see him later.

894
01:24:15,556 --> 01:24:19,184
- We just gave him a sedative.
- No, I gotta see him now.

895
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:22,771
All right, come with me.

896
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:43,417
- Not in here?
- He's safer here.

897
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:46,253
He tried to throw himself out of the car.

898
01:25:02,895 --> 01:25:04,980
Doc.

899
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,817
Daddy. Daddy?

900
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:14,865
- I don't think he hears me.
- Probably not.

901
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:19,536
He's trying to say something.

902
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:24,333
Who's Lola, pretty Lola?
He keeps mumbling, "Pretty Lola."

903
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:32,049
That's me.

904
01:25:44,811 --> 01:25:46,897
Mrs Delaney.

905
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:56,448
You wanna come in for coffee?

906
01:25:56,615 --> 01:26:00,118
No, thanks. We were having breakfast
when you called.

907
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,371
You get some sleep.

908
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:07,936
Long distance.

909
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:10,606
I want Maple 240.

910
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:16,153
This is Valley 846.

911
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:29,124
Hello, Mom. It's Lola, Mom.
How are you?

912
01:27:31,627 --> 01:27:36,215
Yeah. Yeah, I know, Mom,
but Doc's sick again.

913
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:43,931
Do you think Dad would mind very
much if I came home for a little while?

914
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:47,935
I'm awfully unhappy, Mom.

915
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:53,106
Don't you think just for a little while?

916
01:27:53,273 --> 01:27:56,818
Just until I've made up my mind
what to do.

917
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:06,036
All right, Mom.

918
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:10,916
Oh, no. No, it wouldn't
do any good for you to come here.

919
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:15,212
I'II... I'll let you know if I need you.

920
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,091
Thanks, Mom.

921
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:23,053
And... tell Daddy hello.

922
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:09,850
You forgot your bag, Doc.

923
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:14,563
- I don't know how to thank you.
- We'll see you later.

924
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:18,859
- If there's any trouble...
- Call us any time. So long, Doc.

925
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:24,364
And good luck.

926
01:29:45,344 --> 01:29:47,429
Lola?

927
01:29:57,397 --> 01:29:59,483
Lola?

928
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:08,951
Doc?

929
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:16,625
Daddy... are you all right?

930
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:19,920
Yes, I'm all right.

931
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:27,970
Honey, please don't stand like that.
Like I was gonna...

932
01:30:28,136 --> 01:30:30,556
I'm sorry, Doc.

933
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:35,769
- How have you been?
- Oh, I'm all right.

934
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:38,021
I've been fine.

935
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:44,403
I got a letter and a telegram from Marie.
She and Bruce got married.

936
01:30:45,529 --> 01:30:48,115
After all our worrying about her.

937
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:55,372
- Did you like Bruce?
- He was awful nice. Like I expected.

938
01:30:55,539 --> 01:30:58,125
Marie wrote something awful nice.

939
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:01,795
She said you really kept her
from falling for Turk.

940
01:31:03,422 --> 01:31:06,550
- I hope she'll be happy.
- Oh, sure, Doc.

941
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:10,679
We're gonna be happy, too, Daddy.

942
01:31:13,432 --> 01:31:15,517
Did they treat you all right?

943
01:31:16,977 --> 01:31:20,314
Don't ever leave me.
Please don't ever leave me.

944
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:25,402
I don't know what I did or what I said.
I can hardly remember anything.

945
01:31:25,569 --> 01:31:29,656
But please forgive me.
I'll try to make everything up.

946
01:31:30,741 --> 01:31:32,951
I'd never leave you, Daddy.

947
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:37,164
You're all I got, Doc.

948
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:42,211
You're all I ever had.

949
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:58,977
- I feel better already.
- Yes, so do I.

950
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:03,815
Did you have any breakfast?

951
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:06,568
No. When the doctor told me I could go,

952
01:32:06,735 --> 01:32:10,155
I thought I'd wait till I got here
and make breakfast myself.

953
01:32:10,322 --> 01:32:12,533
No, I'll get you some breakfast.

954
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:16,119
Come in the kitchen
and I'll get you a hot breakfast.

955
01:32:16,286 --> 01:32:18,455
I'll scramble you some eggs.

956
01:32:19,998 --> 01:32:22,084
Come on, Doc.

957
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:30,634
You sit down and
I'll get you your fruit juice.

958
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:34,680
And we got bacon, too, Doc.

959
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:40,185
My, it's expensive now, you know.

960
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,814
There you are, Daddy.

961
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:48,402
I'll light the oven
and make you some toast.

962
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:54,575
- And Doc, we got orange marmalade.
- It looks different here.

963
01:32:54,741 --> 01:32:59,705
Oh, sure, I fixed it all up. We got
new curtains. I painted the ice box.

964
01:32:59,872 --> 01:33:03,166
- Looks nice.
- It's gonna stay nice, too.

965
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:06,670
I had another dream
the other night, Doc.

966
01:33:07,754 --> 01:33:12,801
- About Little Sheba?
- About everything and everybody.

967
01:33:12,968 --> 01:33:16,138
Marie and I was going to the Olympics.

968
01:33:16,305 --> 01:33:19,766
Only it was back in
our old high school stadium.

969
01:33:19,933 --> 01:33:22,311
There was thousands of people there.

970
01:33:22,477 --> 01:33:25,981
Turk was in out in the field,
throwing the javelin.

971
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:29,693
Every time he threw it,
the crowd would roar.

972
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:32,446
You know who the man in charge was?

973
01:33:32,613 --> 01:33:34,948
My father.

974
01:33:36,283 --> 01:33:41,830
But Turk kept changing into somebody
else, so my father disqualified him.

975
01:33:41,997 --> 01:33:44,625
Then he had to sit on the sidelines.

976
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:47,419
Guess who took his place, Daddy.

977
01:33:47,586 --> 01:33:52,758
You. You came trotting out
on the field just as big as you please.

978
01:33:52,925 --> 01:33:55,219
- How'd I do, baby?
- Oh, fine.

979
01:33:55,385 --> 01:34:00,140
You picked up the javelin like it was
real heavy, but you threw it, Doc.

980
01:34:00,307 --> 01:34:02,976
You threw it clear up in the sky.

981
01:34:03,143 --> 01:34:05,229
It never came down again.

982
01:34:06,271 --> 01:34:08,357
Then it started to rain.

983
01:34:08,524 --> 01:34:12,736
I was going nearly crazy
'cause I couldn't find Little Sheba.

984
01:34:12,903 --> 01:34:16,782
There were so many people,
I didn't know where to look.

985
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:19,034
You was waiting to take me home.

986
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:22,996
So we walked and walked
through the mud and the slush.

987
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:25,791
People was all crowding around us.

988
01:34:27,084 --> 01:34:30,462
And then... This is the sad part, Daddy.

989
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:33,131
All of a sudden, I saw Little Sheba.

990
01:34:33,298 --> 01:34:36,593
She was lying
in the middle of the field, dead.

991
01:34:37,678 --> 01:34:41,640
I felt terrible, Doc.
Nobody else paid any attention.

992
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:43,892
But I cried and cried.

993
01:34:44,935 --> 01:34:48,647
It made me feel awful.
That sweet little puppy.

994
01:34:48,814 --> 01:34:54,319
Her white fur all smeared with mud.
No one to stop and take care of her.

995
01:34:54,486 --> 01:34:58,615
- Why couldn't you?
- You wouldn't let me.

996
01:34:58,782 --> 01:35:03,745
You kept saying, "We can't
stay here, honey, we gotta go on."

997
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:09,334
- Ain't that strange?
- Dreams are funny.

998
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:19,261
I don't think Little Sheba's
ever coming back, Doc.

999
01:35:19,428 --> 01:35:23,432
- I ain't gonna call her any more.
- Not much point in it, baby.

1000
01:35:23,599 --> 01:35:25,767
I guess she's gone for good.

1001
01:35:28,353 --> 01:35:30,439
I'll fix your eggs.

1002
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,446
It's good to be home.
