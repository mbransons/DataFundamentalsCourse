1
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,891
I'd like another shot
at that prize money.

2
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,268
Okay for next Sunday?

3
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,270
No, Jim. It ain't okay.

4
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,399
- Now, look, Bice, I know...
- No, you look.

5
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,235
All of my drivers are 18, 19.

6
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,946
You're too old for
these kid snorts.

7
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,948
You're liable to
get hurt in there.

8
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,033
You used to be a big track driver.

9
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,827
Ain't you got no pride?

10
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,705
I ran out of pride when
I ran out of cars.

11
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,541
Jim, you gotta look at yourself.

12
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,876
Okay, you start out all right.
You win a couple of tracks,

13
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,211
you think you're on your way.

14
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,131
But it didn't work out, did it?

15
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,847
Much obliged.

16
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,473
You need any money?

17
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:48,727
Nope.

18
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:51,479
Hey...

19
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,274
What do you do with this stuff?

20
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,401
It's for a friend.

21
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:03,074
Hey, how'd it go?

22
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,326
Okay.

23
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,996
- I brought you something.
- Oh, thanks.

24
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,789
Oh, the poor thing.

25
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,417
I'll find a good spot for it.

26
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,127
You got hurt again.

27
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:15,295
- So?
- One of these days,

28
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,422
you're gonna get
wiped out entirely.

29
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,342
Why you gotta be a driver?

30
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,927
Maybe that's not
your thing, racing.

31
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,473
How about all those car
agencies down on Van Ness?

32
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,188
I bet that a top
mechanic there gets

33
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,642
a lot of good bread laid on him.

34
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,935
What is the matter with everybody?

35
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,645
Can't you understand?
I'm not a mechanic.

36
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,938
I'm a driver.

37
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,149
I know just how you feel, Jim.

38
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,402
Hey, I used to think that I was
happy painting flower seeds.

39
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,448
Then one day, inside me, there
was this little voice, says,

40
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,784
"Tennessee Steinmetz."

41
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,160
I said, "What?"

42
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,329
It said, "You ain't
happy." Well, I...

43
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:50,680
Tennessee, would you
tell me something?

44
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,291
Why is it the only thing we ever
have in this house is parrot food?

45
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,293
I mean, we don't have a parrot.

46
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,961
Hey, eat that. That's good.

47
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,254
That's pressed kelp.

48
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,215
That aerates your liver.

49
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,510
Then this voice inside of
me continued as follows...

50
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,389
"This is nowhere. You
gotta make a new scene.

51
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,849
"You gotta change your bag."

52
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,975
That's when I split.

53
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:16,022
I went to Tibet, to a mountaintop
with swamis and monks.

54
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,817
I discovered my real self.

55
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,861
It was wonderful.

56
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,198
I don't have to go to Tibet.

57
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,367
I know who I am.

58
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,329
I know what I want.

59
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,568
Hey, there are dirt track races at

60
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,417
a carnival near
Bakersfield this week.

61
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,502
If I can get over there, I can
pick up a couple of bucks.

62
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,670
Okay to use your wheels?

63
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,463
Yeah, okay, but I'm
afraid you're gonna have

64
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,257
a little trouble
getting it started.

65
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,593
Where's the beast?

66
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,806
You didn't cut up the Edsel?

67
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,980
Came over me all of a sudden.

68
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:59,190
It was the only
decent thing to do.

69
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,695
Believe me, Jim. It'll
be happier up there.

70
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,996
Are you all right? Are you dizzy?

71
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,082
Oh, no. Well, there's a slight
racking pain in my head.

72
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,293
Oh, I think you'd better sit down.

73
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:01,794
I'm really terribly sorry.

74
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,755
Well, it's not your fault.

75
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,089
I didn't mean to startle you.

76
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:08,301
Looks like you've been running
into all sorts of things lately.

77
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,221
Yeah. Oh, oh, this
is just a little...

78
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:16,684
Oh, lady.

79
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,645
Oh, really, sir.

80
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,854
Excuse me.

81
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,154
Over 400 cubes...

82
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:32,283
Dual quads, all synchro
box, zero to 60 under five.

83
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,453
All right, Miss Bennett, I'll
see to this gentleman myself.

84
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,789
May I be of service, sir?

85
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:41,543
I see that you're a person
who appreciates fine things.

86
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,004
You're no doubt aware that this is
the celebrated Thorndyke special.

87
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,798
And allow me to say, sir,

88
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:49,759
that I think this car
would suit you very well.

89
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,427
Yes. Yes, it would.

90
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,889
Yes, may I offer you a glass
of sherry and a biscuit?

91
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,516
Go right ahead.

92
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:58,643
I take it that the
question of price

93
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:01,813
does not greatly concern a
gentleman like yourself.

94
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,731
Oh, I wouldn't haggle,
if that's what you mean.

95
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,067
What price range did
you have in mind?

96
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,319
About $75.

97
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:11,739
$75?

98
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,157
I could go 80 in a pinch.

99
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,167
What do you have in the way of
cheap, honest transportation?

100
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,787
Cheap, honest transportation.

101
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,085
I will bid you good day, sir.

102
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,337
Good day.

103
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,381
Hey.

104
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,050
Havershaw.

105
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,678
Now, where did this come from?

106
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,014
Mr. Thorndyke, yes, sir?

107
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:38,474
What is this thing doing
in my showroom, may I ask?

108
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,102
Oh, I believe Miss Bennett may
know something about this.

109
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:45,398
Yes, you remember when Mrs. Van
Luit purchased her new Bentley?

110
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,169
Well, she also
requested us to buy a

111
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,901
small used car for
her upstairs maid.

112
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,530
Then why isn't her upstairs
maid in her blasted vehicle?

113
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,657
The car was returned this
morning, Mr. Thorndyke.

114
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,035
She was having some kind
of difficulty with it.

115
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,995
- Get it out of here.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,707
What's that for?

117
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,500
I beg your pardon?

118
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,378
Why don't you let the
little car alone?

119
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,090
Are you presuming to tell me what
to do in my own establishment?

120
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,509
Okay, I'm outta line.

121
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,638
It just bugs me to see somebody

122
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,970
abusing a decent
piece of machinery.

123
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,555
Fascinating.

124
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,724
Well, now that we've had the
benefit of your point of view,

125
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,976
shall we regard our
relationship as terminated?

126
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,061
Havershaw.

127
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,563
Get this eyesore out
of my showroom.

128
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,315
And if ever I find it here again,

129
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,652
someone is going to find himself
in a great deal of trouble.

130
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,320
Yes, sir. Watch your
knees there, boys.

131
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:33,905
Here we go.

132
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,078
Sorry. None of my business, is it?

133
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,080
Perfectly all right.

134
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:44,040
Goodbye.

135
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,750
Oh, goodbye.

136
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:25,957
Good morning.

137
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,458
Good morning. What do you want?

138
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:29,377
Police.

139
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,963
Right. What do you want?

140
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:36,134
Forgive me for pointing, but have
you ever seen that car before?

141
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,302
No. No, I haven't.

142
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:40,513
Hey, he's a cute little fella.

143
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,266
Hey, wait a minute.

144
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:47,353
I think I saw that car
at an agency yesterday.

145
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,065
Now permit me to inform
you of the following.

146
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,332
First, say nothing that would

147
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,112
jeopardise your
constitutional rights.

148
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:59,157
Second, the minute
that you get downtown,

149
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,451
I would advise that you
get a good lawyer.

150
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,580
Shall we go?

151
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,457
Go? What for?

152
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,334
On suspicion of grand theft.

153
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:15,339
Look, now, wait a minute. There's
something cock-eyed about this.

154
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,925
How did that little car get here?

155
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,345
I share your curiosity.

156
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,055
Shall we go?

157
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,520
I'll do it. Okay.

158
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,491
I'll do it, but I
just want to go on

159
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,524
record. I have seen
some crummy stunts

160
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,778
in my time used to sell cars,
but this beats everything.

161
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,363
To plant this bug in the
possession of an innocent man

162
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,952
and then to accuse
me of stealing it.

163
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:41,953
How dare you, sir.

164
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:44,118
Are you suggesting that I
would stoop to such tactics?

165
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:45,870
That's exactly what
I'm suggesting.

166
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,914
In the first place,
it might interest you

167
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,298
to know that under
normal circumstances,

168
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,875
I would never sell
a car to someone

169
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,336
with whom I'm not, well, shall
we say, socially compatible.

170
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:54,712
Socially compatible?

171
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,881
Please, please, let's not
go through that again.

172
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,883
I think we've worked
it out very well.

173
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,511
Mr. Douglas needs a car, and
for a very low amount down,

174
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:05,014
and the usual monthly payments,
the car will become his.

175
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,517
Very well, even though
my personal inclination

176
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,352
is to have Mr. Douglas
tapped into jail,

177
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:12,063
and this four-wheel contrivance
dropped into the bay.

178
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:15,233
I think Mr. Thorndyke
is being very fair.

179
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,027
Fair? It's not fair.
I'm being muscled.

180
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,460
I just want you to
know that I know

181
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:20,696
I know it, and I don't like it.

182
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,700
I'll draw up the papers. Would
you come with me, please?

183
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,911
Then get Mr. Douglas
and his acquisition

184
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:29,705
out of here before
I lose my temper.

185
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,335
What the...

186
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:20,089
What's the matter? You
from LA or something?

187
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,608
Fine. I thought we'd run over
to that new restaurant...

188
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,369
Have you gone mad?

189
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,164
Okay, what's the joke?

190
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,332
What do you mean?

191
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,450
I don't know how you rigged it,

192
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,043
but I'm sure that
car's a real cutup

193
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,419
when a convention comes to town.

194
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:00,171
If I wanted a trick
car, I would've

195
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,422
bought one in a joke shop.

196
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,883
Allow me to say that I
haven't the slightest idea

197
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:04,967
what you're talking about.

198
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,178
You come blithering up in
that beastly little car,

199
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,931
and assault my
personal Rolls-Royce.

200
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,308
I brought it back.
I want my money,

201
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,353
I want the papers I signed, and
then I'll get out of here,

202
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,521
and you two clowns can
have your little laugh.

203
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,191
Mr. Douglas, if there is
anything wrong with the car,

204
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:23,235
would you be good enough
to tell me what it is?

205
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,112
There's nothing essentially
wrong with the car.

206
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,431
It's just that it wants to go one
way, and I'd like to go the other.

207
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,194
Whatever it is, none
of it is covered

208
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:30,493
in our gilt-edged guarantee.

209
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:31,661
Oh, I'm sure of that.

210
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,204
If you examine paragraph 12...

211
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,372
Excuse me, Mr. Thorndyke,

212
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,465
but if I sold this
gentleman the car,

213
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,209
I feel a certain responsibility.

214
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,127
Do you mind if I try it?

215
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,051
Miss Bennett.

216
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,387
Our dinner engagement.

217
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:51,305
I won't be a minute.

218
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,728
Seems to be acting all right now.

219
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,725
Sometimes new car owners have a

220
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:02,191
tendency to exaggerate
their problems.

221
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,734
We get that all the time.

222
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,571
Believe me, when I was in
this car alone, it was...

223
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,031
Just treat it gently at first.

224
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,242
It really is quite a
fine little automobile.

225
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:15,413
Have you had much
experience with cars?

226
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,374
Look, lady, by profession,
I'm a racing driver.

227
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:22,294
Oh, that Jim Douglas.

228
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,505
What do you mean,
"That Jim Douglas"?

229
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:28,092
Let's see. Two years ago at
Laguna Seca, you spun out,

230
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,429
and hung a beautiful Buick
Special on the back fence.

231
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:35,224
At Willow Springs... Was it
a year ago last February?

232
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,893
You sprayed a Lotus
all over the infield.

233
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:39,645
How do you know all that?

234
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:44,066
I have trouble with names and
faces, but I never forget a car.

235
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,318
I like good machinery.

236
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,405
Now, why don't you give this
little car a fair chance?

237
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,073
You bought it. Enjoy it.

238
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,493
You can drive me back now.

239
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,168
How about it, Dad?

240
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,962
Want to give that
doodlebug a workout?

241
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,172
I'll go easy on you.

242
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,882
Be serious, will you?

243
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,364
Did you see this thing take off?

244
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,325
One of your showboat
tricks, Mr. Douglas?

245
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:35,993
I tell you, I had
nothing to do with it.

246
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,286
Hey, we were turning.

247
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,205
Out of sight, man.

248
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,664
I wouldn't have believed it.

249
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,750
Groovy, Pop. Groovy.

250
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,504
Well, as long as the customer
finally seems pleased,

251
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,048
I'll just step out and
find myself a taxi.

252
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,511
Will you stop the car, please?

253
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,179
I'm trying. Look.

254
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:58,849
It's just like I told you.

255
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,476
This thing's starting
to act up again.

256
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,438
How very odd. When I was driving,
there was no problem whatsoever.

257
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,664
I can't seem to do
anything with it.

258
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:23,435
Mr. Douglas, I'm
asking you nicely to

259
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:25,209
pull over to that
kerb and let me out.

260
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,711
Look, I'm sorry about
your date. I really am.

261
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,464
I didn't want you to miss
your dinner engagement.

262
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:36,971
What's the rush, tiger?
We got all night.

263
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,392
Goodbye, Mr. Douglas.

264
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,187
Here, I'll help you.

265
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,231
I can get out, thank you.

266
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,942
What'll it be, chief?

267
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,694
Oh, hey, look, we have
a little problem here.

268
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,737
Would you mind helping the young
lady get her car door open?

269
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,406
Look, I'm busy.

270
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:57,074
And furthermore, I
ain't no mechanic.

271
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,868
All I do here is sell food,

272
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,578
and that ain't too good.

273
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,912
You want something, or don't you?

274
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,582
- Help.
- Two hamburgers and a coffee.

275
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,754
Help.

276
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,424
Can you help me, please?

277
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,432
Help. I'm a prisoner.
I can't get out.

278
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,269
We all prisoners, chickie baby.

279
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,730
We all locked in.

280
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:35,279
A couple of weirdos, Guinevere.

281
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,782
What... Wait a minute, now.

282
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,867
Hold it, hold it.

283
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,452
Let me open the door.

284
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:42,828
Hey, knock it off, will you, sis?

285
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,122
I ain't saying this is the
classiest joint in town,

286
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,790
but we gotta draw
the line somewhere.

287
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,042
Come on, back in your seat.

288
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,379
Why don't you go up
to Seabreeze Point?

289
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,465
Fuzz don't bother
you much up there.

290
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:55,674
Thanks.

291
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:10,356
I wish there was some way I could
make up for those hamburgers.

292
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,816
Mr. Douglas, please
don't go on about it.

293
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,280
I'm quite sure that
if I were driving,

294
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,694
none of these things
would've happened.

295
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,741
It's all yours.

296
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:28,582
Now I think you'll
see what's what.

297
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:49,186
This is very embarrassing.

298
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:52,815
Yes, it is.

299
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,359
I would've preferred knowing
you a little longer first.

300
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:56,860
Just a minute.

301
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,946
You don't for one solitary instant

302
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,781
dare to think that I drove
you here on purpose?

303
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:01,991
Oh, don't try to explain.

304
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,367
The point is, you brought me here.

305
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,035
I did not bring you here.

306
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,912
It's this nasty little car.

307
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,208
But you said yourself earlier,
it's a very nice little car.

308
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,627
And as you said before, it does
have some peculiar traits,

309
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,878
and I agree with you completely.

310
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,711
As a matter of fact,
bring it in tomorrow,

311
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:18,215
and I'll find a
replacement for you.

312
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,551
I don't want the car replaced.

313
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,097
As a matter of fact, I'm
beginning to like it.

314
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:27,474
Oh.

315
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,476
Don't panic, don't panic.

316
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,645
There must be some place
I can call a taxi.

317
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,736
Hey.

318
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,119
You know, for a moment there, I
thought you weren't going to stop.

319
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:33,999
What's the matter now?

320
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:45,969
Hey, look, this is ridiculous.

321
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,554
Let's get back in the car, huh?

322
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,641
Hold it. Hold it, everybody.

323
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:53,143
Just a moment, please.

324
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,731
Something the matter?

325
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:01,151
Is this man bothering you?

326
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,653
No, not exactly.

327
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:04,363
It's okay, we're together.

328
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,491
Is that your car?

329
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,826
My...

330
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:13,080
Well, yes. Yes it is.

331
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,583
Okay, then. Move along.

332
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,590
- Hey, bud.
- Yeah?

333
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,218
Not too smart wandering
around the park at night.

334
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,511
Right.

335
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,637
I'll drive.

336
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,850
She'll drive.

337
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:38,188
I should've given you a citation.

338
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:39,898
You ought to have enough sense

339
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,901
to put your brakes on while
your car is stopped.

340
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,497
Well, then if everything that
you say about this car is true,

341
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,624
it's already starting to happen.

342
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,543
What's starting to happen?

343
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:01,253
Us human beings.

344
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:03,881
We had a chance to make
something out of this world.

345
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,716
We blew it. Okay.

346
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,844
Another kind of a civilisation
is gonna take a turn.

347
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,554
Give me an 11 mil wrench, will ya?

348
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,389
I'm sitting up on top of
this mountain, right?

349
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,474
Right.

350
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,393
I'm surrounded by these gurus
and swamis and monks, right?

351
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,104
- Right.
- I'm looking at my stomach,

352
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,856
I'm knocking back a
little rice wine.

353
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,652
Got some contemplation going.

354
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:27,446
I see things like they are.

355
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,198
I could have told you
all this was coming.

356
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,491
What's coming?

357
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,159
Jim, it's happening
right under our noses,

358
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:33,827
and we can't see it.

359
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,788
We take machines, and we
stuff them with information,

360
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,457
until they're smarter than we are.

361
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,958
Take a car.

362
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:45,255
Most guys spread more love and
time and money on a car in a week

363
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,883
than they do on their
wife and kids in a year.

364
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,760
Pretty soon, you know what?

365
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:53,180
The machine starts to
think it is somebody.

366
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,310
I'm not saying that a mechanical
thing, it can't be a friend.

367
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:00,562
Like, when I was broke one summer,

368
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:05,067
there was this giant claw machine
in the Sutro Amusement Park.

369
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:07,097
And it would grab
cameras and watches,

370
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:08,779
and drop them down a hole to me.

371
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,572
And I would hawk
them and buy lunch.

372
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,823
- You follow me?
- Yeah, yeah.

373
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:15,160
I think you were up on
that mountaintop too long.

374
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:20,624
Contrariwise, the traffic light
down the street hates my guts.

375
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,377
I don't know why, but
in the last six weeks,

376
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,837
I haven't caught anything
but a stop signal.

377
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,519
And it makes me wait six seconds

378
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,466
longer than anybody
else. I timed it.

379
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:33,887
There's things like that happen
to lots of other people, too.

380
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,139
But the other people, they
don't tell no other people,

381
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,142
because the other
people would say,

382
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,312
Tennessee,

383
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,440
that traffic light is a
lot of nuts and bolts.

384
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,651
This little car, lot
of nuts and bolts.

385
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:50,821
Everything explains itself
one way or the other.

386
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,489
You're not listening to me.

387
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,283
Don't lose your grip, old buddy.

388
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,010
This little car didn't
do one thing tonight

389
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,828
that can't be explained in
terms of short circuits,

390
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:00,706
sprung doors, grabbing
steering, worn knuckles...

391
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,749
Maybe some advertising gimmick.

392
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,209
I'll fix it.

393
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,837
I don't think you got the picture.

394
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,297
I got a beautiful picture.

395
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,841
This baby happens to have
an extra turn of speed,

396
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,743
which is the only
thing I care about.

397
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,971
You don't understand
what happens, do you?

398
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:20,142
They make 10,000 cars, they
make them exactly the same way,

399
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:22,644
and one or two of them turn
out to be something special.

400
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:25,856
Nobody knows why.

401
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,317
I know why.

402
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,444
I may be kidding myself,

403
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,768
but I think I can
make something out

404
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,948
of that sad little
bucket of bolts.

405
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,618
Save these. They'll
be famous someday.

406
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,543
I'm your friend.

407
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,478
Want to take a ride?

408
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,438
I want to check those
adjustments I made last night.

409
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:07,981
- Okay.
- Be right with you.

410
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,285
Hey. Come here.

411
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,459
All right, you guys,
get out of there.

412
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:28,627
Out. Come on.

413
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:30,754
Who do you guys think you are?

414
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,883
Stop clowning around, will you?

415
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,760
Play it straight.

416
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,428
Don't give him any trouble.

417
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,263
You could have a good home here.

418
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,807
What's all that racket?

419
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,351
- Nothing, nothing.
- Oh. Hop in.

420
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,956
What'd I tell you?

421
00:27:05,998 --> 00:27:08,417
Now it handles good.
All the bugs are gone.

422
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,793
Herbie's all right.

423
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:11,586
Who's Herbie?

424
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,965
This little car, named
after my Uncle Herb.

425
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:16,341
He used to box middleweight.

426
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,968
Preliminary mostly.

427
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:20,303
Gradually his nose got
shaped more and more

428
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,181
like to remind me
of this little car.

429
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,307
Do you mind?

430
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,976
Whatever you say, Tennessee.

431
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,144
Herbie.

432
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:34,901
I'll take them.

433
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,069
Thank you, sir.

434
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,362
What's that for?

435
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,447
An oil job.

436
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,489
Huh?

437
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,992
I got a small knock
in my conscience.

438
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:43,368
Thanks.

439
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,182
Now we get down to business.

440
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,308
You gonna race?

441
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,684
What do you think?

442
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,603
Oh, boy, won't Herbie love that.

443
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,772
Le Mans, Monte-Carlo,

444
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,816
thrills, glamour, the
roar of the crowd.

445
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,055
He really does drive.

446
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:47,015
If you could give
me one good reason

447
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,227
for bringing me down to
this ridiculous desert...

448
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,736
Isn't that the scruffy little
car we had in the shop?

449
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,909
Now we're going.

450
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,754
You're doing terrific, Herbie,

451
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,215
but don't make it look too easy.

452
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,384
Play it smart.

453
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:27,514
Okay, Jim, go ahead.

454
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:29,683
You're raring now.

455
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,199
So who cares? I'll
tell you one thing,

456
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,619
I certainly don't intend losing
any sleep over that absurd car.

457
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,791
Come on. Come on.

458
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,015
Now, Herbie, now. Now.

459
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:22,068
The winner, number 53,

460
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,988
Jim Douglas, driving
a class D special.

461
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:26,364
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

462
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,325
- Good race, Jim.
- Thanks, Ray.

463
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,327
Oh boy, was Herbie
ever great today.

464
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:31,453
Hey, I was out there, too.

465
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:33,129
Wouldn't you say that was
a fair piece of driving?

466
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,248
Hey, I'm not trying to take
anything away from you,

467
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,001
but you gotta admit that this
little guy backed you all the way.

468
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,295
Yep. It's a nice little car.

469
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,172
You know something else?

470
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:44,405
For the first time
in a long while, I

471
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:46,384
felt my real self out there today.

472
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,679
I mean, a sense of authority, like
the top drivers have, you know?

473
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,848
I kind of felt you felt that.

474
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,783
Tennessee, I wouldn't admit
this to anybody else,

475
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:56,853
but I was beginning to think
I'd never be anything more

476
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,106
than a piston-happy,
lead-foot punk.

477
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,401
Then this starts to happen.

478
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,445
I'm glad for you, Jim.

479
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,572
You know that.

480
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,449
Well, hello.

481
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:12,327
I see you finally learned
how to handle this car.

482
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,267
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

483
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:16,456
What have you done to this thing?

484
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,375
Oh, an adjustment here,
an adjustment there.

485
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,626
Do you want to sell it back?

486
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,211
I own most of it anyway, you know.

487
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:23,296
Still 23 payments to go.

488
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,381
Well...

489
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,268
I'll tell you what
I'll do. I'll take

490
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:27,968
the car and give you $1,000 clear.

491
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,260
Now what do you say to that?

492
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,845
No. You don't want to do that.

493
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:33,682
It's all right, Tennessee.
I know what I'm doing.

494
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,414
I think Mr. Thorndyke
is a little mixed

495
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:36,935
up as to who or
what won that race.

496
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,395
And what does that mean?

497
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,773
Someday I'll teach you not to
confuse the car with the driver.

498
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,900
I should welcome the opportunity.

499
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,903
Mr. Thorndyke, I think that's
a very good idea of yours.

500
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,946
What is?

501
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,467
You're racing in the Libra Open at

502
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:51,157
Riverside the end of
the month, right?

503
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,242
Yes.

504
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:53,702
I'm sure that Mr. Douglas
would like to get

505
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,704
the remainder of his
payments off his back.

506
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:56,746
No doubt.

507
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,540
But why should I think
that's such a good idea?

508
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,432
Well, if Mr. Douglas
entered the race,

509
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:02,377
he could bet his share
of the little car

510
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,045
against the remaining payment.

511
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:06,172
What do you say, Douglas?

512
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,300
Winner to become the
sole owner of the car.

513
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,933
A moment ago you mentioned
teaching me a lesson.

514
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,686
Do I now detect a
note of timidity?

515
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,939
Racing.

516
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,315
That's the name of
the game, isn't it?

517
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,818
Win or lose, put up or shut up.

518
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:28,653
You got yourself a
deal, Thorndyke.

519
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,738
Splendid.

520
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,367
The drivers' meeting is over.

521
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,097
Now the third race
of the afternoon

522
00:32:36,098 --> 00:32:37,787
will get underway
here at Riverside.

523
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,416
You keep your eye on your
friend in the bug, my dear.

524
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,126
I'm going to squash him.

525
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,627
Clear the grid.

526
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,504
Clear the grid, please.

527
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,922
Can't help feeling yippie.

528
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,300
If anything goes wrong, we
lose Herbie altogether.

529
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:52,385
I thought you were the guy with
all the faith in this car.

530
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,970
Yeah, I got it, yeah.

531
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,307
And now the starter has
his flag in the air.

532
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:59,059
The engines are started,

533
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,352
and in just a moment
we'll have the start.

534
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,980
All the cars looking
very smart on the grid.

535
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,618
Drivers signify that
they're ready to race

536
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,652
with their hands
extended in the air.

537
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:11,154
The flag is up, and there they go.

538
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:15,867
All cars getting off
to a very nice start.

539
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:18,119
Off the grid on the
way to turn one.

540
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,955
We'll see how they shape up
as they go into turn one.

541
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,710
Cars stretching out now.

542
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,130
All cars off the starting
grid and through turn one.

543
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,468
To the open now.

544
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,105
Down the backstretch,
all by himself now.

545
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,748
Here is the number
14 car of Thorndyke

546
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:49,651
going into the sweeper turn.

547
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,267
The rest of the field
all stretched out

548
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:54,030
as they charge down
the backstretch.

549
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,786
Not yet, Herbie. Not yet.

550
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,877
The standings at lap 23...

551
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,380
Thorndyke still leading,
Lesser running second,

552
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:12,549
and Erwin in third place.

553
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:20,265
Now, Herbie, now.

554
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:30,066
Now car number 53, Douglas,
starts to make a move.

555
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,360
Picking up cars as he
goes by car number 20,

556
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:36,114
into the sweeper
very hard and fast.

557
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:38,950
Going through traffic,
passing number 23 now,

558
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:42,078
is car number 53, Douglas.

559
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,875
He has just come alive and is
making a challenge in this race.

560
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,087
Passing cars as he goes
down the back-straight.

561
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:54,215
Car number 53, Douglas,
making his bid.

562
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,219
Into the straight now is
Thorndyke, car number 14.

563
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:00,763
Now the pressure's on.

564
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,376
Douglas, number 53,
is drawing close

565
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:05,768
on Thorndyke in the number 14 car.

566
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:11,357
Douglas has just come alive and
is pressing the leader now.

567
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,112
Now making his bid to
pass but he can't get by.

568
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,158
He's being shut off by Thorndyke
in the number 14 car.

569
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,046
Goes slightly off course,
takes out some oranges,

570
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,798
and apparently is out of control.

571
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,468
And goes crashing into the
number four shut off card.

572
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:44,432
Thorndyke continuing on as
the number 53 car left...

573
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,351
Now he's making his re-entry.

574
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:53,858
Look out.

575
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,035
Hey, nice going, champ.

576
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,119
Thank you very much.

577
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:07,205
Hey, what a champ. Way to drive.

578
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,875
Just a moment, Mr.
Thorndyke, you don't have...

579
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,836
I demand that this thing
is impounded and checked.

580
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,922
I tell you, there's more going
on here than meets the eye.

581
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,842
Mucha luck, señor.

582
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:43,968
Thank you.

583
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,595
A usted también.

584
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,264
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

585
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,009
You don't look well in
these pictures lately.

586
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,803
How could I look well?

587
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,388
I haven't been able to sleep.

588
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:13,474
That rotten car is
driving me piffy.

589
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,520
Has it occurred to you that
it may not be the rotten car?

590
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,564
Perhaps it's the way
Mr. Douglas drives.

591
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,191
Balderdash. There isn't
a driver in the world

592
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,360
who can get that speed
out of a car like that.

593
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,364
No, he's done something to it,
and I've got to find out what.

594
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,616
You've become obsessed
by this whole thing.

595
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,160
There are other cars, other races.

596
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:34,370
Why don't you just forget it?

597
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:39,459
My dear child, how
little you know me.

598
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,044
Yes, Mr. Thorndyke.

599
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,588
Carole?

600
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:46,424
How long have you been with us?

601
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:48,342
A year and a half,
almost two. Why?

602
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,386
You know, I'm afraid I've
been a little remiss

603
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,388
in not telling you long before now

604
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,474
how very well you've
proved in all your duties.

605
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,225
Well, thank you.

606
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,268
And Carole?

607
00:39:57,352 --> 00:39:59,323
As I realise you have
the best interests

608
00:39:59,324 --> 00:40:00,813
of this organisation at heart,

609
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,733
I want you to accede to a
somewhat unusual request.

610
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:06,068
Oh?

611
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,155
Peter Thorndyke.

612
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:11,491
It's for you.

613
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,076
All right, you can take it here.

614
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,620
Thank you.

615
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,247
Yes, good afternoon.

616
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,920
Oh, I think that should
be quite all right.

617
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,589
7:30 will be fine.

618
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,175
Yes, bye.

619
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,510
I think I'll...

620
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,345
I'd like you to see
this Douglas fellow.

621
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,429
Get to know him.

622
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,390
Who knows? If he has the talents
of which I believe him capable,

623
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:37,932
perhaps we can give
him the opportunity

624
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:39,018
of joining our organisation,

625
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:40,539
racing under our
colours, but first

626
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,896
we must know something about him.

627
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,731
- How about tonight?
- Very good.

628
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,815
At 7:30?

629
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,194
Very good. Why waste time?

630
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,946
Oh, and, Carole, another thing.

631
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:50,988
Leave your car.

632
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,407
Take the special.
He likes that one.

633
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:55,451
Thank you.

634
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,921
I think I ought to
tell you that that

635
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:00,122
was Mr. Douglas who just called.

636
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,416
Excellent. Strike while
the iron is hot.

637
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,794
In all honesty, I should
like to point out

638
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:06,629
that I agreed to
have dinner with him

639
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,256
before you suggested it.

640
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:10,174
Well, I salute your
honesty, my dear.

641
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,593
A quality not necessarily
to be despised.

642
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,138
Thank you.

643
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,225
A very loyal girl.

644
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,814
Got Herbie all
polished out for you.

645
00:41:24,856 --> 00:41:25,982
Carole Bennett called back.

646
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,817
She's gonna pick me
up in the special.

647
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:29,819
You mean you're not taking Herbie?

648
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:32,989
He's looking forward to some
relaxation just like you are.

649
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:34,657
The car is...

650
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,284
See you later, Tennessee.

651
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:39,579
Some thanks after what
Herbie did for you.

652
00:41:45,752 --> 00:41:47,420
Don't let it get you, Herbie.

653
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:48,963
Jim didn't mean it.

654
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,716
Don't forget, he isn't the first
guy ever to lose his head

655
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,593
over a bucket seat
and a paint job.

656
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,677
He'll come to his senses.

657
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,056
Good evening.

658
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,517
Sorry, the other rats are
out for the evening.

659
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
No, no, please.

660
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:04,353
I didn't come by to
see Mr. Douglas.

661
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,773
I just came by to pay my respects
to that gallant little car.

662
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,858
Huh?

663
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:10,610
There it is.

664
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,946
What a marvel it is, indeed.

665
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,031
I don't get you, fella.

666
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:18,659
Oh, come, come, sir, I know a rare
bit of machinery when I see one.

667
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,120
And after all, who should
know it better than I?

668
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:25,291
I, who have been trounced time
and again by this paragon.

669
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,813
You will forgive me for saying so,

670
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,377
sir, but it does
take class to know

671
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,212
when it has been
defeated by class.

672
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,592
You know something, Mr. Thorndyke,
I may have misjudged you.

673
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:36,385
Well, thank you.

674
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,638
I've been misjudging a
lot of people lately.

675
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:41,432
Would you like a drink?
Some Irish coffee?

676
00:42:41,516 --> 00:42:43,476
Speciality of the house,
my own mother's recipe.

677
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,061
That's very kind of
you, I'd love it.

678
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,479
I'll be back in a jiffy.

679
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:49,357
Well, that's most kind.
Thank you so much.

680
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:52,541
It's just incredible,
isn't it, to think

681
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,904
that this innocent-seeming object

682
00:42:54,988 --> 00:42:57,740
is capable of such great deeds.

683
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,286
How, indeed.

684
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,248
The trick is, always remember
to have asbestos gloves

685
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,001
when you make coffee this way.

686
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,087
Definitely, yes.

687
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,547
Yes, quite fascinating.

688
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:22,765
Here we go.

689
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:26,268
Ooh. Oh. Oh...

690
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,605
How very refreshing.

691
00:43:30,857 --> 00:43:32,274
Well, thank you.

692
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,568
Up the Irish.

693
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:37,081
To the little car, a
gallant adversary,

694
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,490
and may the best car
win at Riverside.

695
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:41,659
- May the best car win.
- Yes.

696
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:45,621
Oh, that's very good, isn't it?

697
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,248
Very good, indeed.

698
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,965
Like it?

699
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,467
What do you think?

700
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,806
I can't stand that
hungry look any longer.

701
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:05,975
Take over.

702
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:12,940
You know what I said to myself
the first time I saw you?

703
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:13,983
What?

704
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:16,694
I said to myself, now,
there's a real lady.

705
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,659
This is how it ought to be.

706
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,619
Me and these kind of wheels.

707
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,597
Excuse me asking, but aren't you

708
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,498
doing all right with
the little car?

709
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,125
Sure.

710
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:34,462
But can you imagine how I'd make
it with equipment like this?

711
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:37,173
Is it so important to you?

712
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,844
Without a real car,
I'm only half a man.

713
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,726
What part of Ireland did you
say your mother came from?

714
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:52,104
Coney Ireland.

715
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,857
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

716
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,861
I'm gonna make some more coffee.

717
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,234
Well, would you like
a spot of this?

718
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:39,860
I like a spot of anything.

719
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,695
I'm so sorry.

720
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,697
Then we're gonna drink to Herbie.

721
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,033
Greatest little car
in the whole world.

722
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,952
Yes, quite right. Hear, hear.

723
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,829
Hear, hear.

724
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,080
To Herbie.

725
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:53,040
To Herbie. I'm so sorry
about your hand.

726
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,083
I do apologise.

727
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:55,751
Herbie.

728
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:03,759
What do you know?
The engine stalled.

729
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:07,096
How about that? Door's stuck.

730
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,183
That's how it is
with cars sometimes.

731
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,309
Yes.

732
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,854
Guess we'll have to wait
and see what happens next.

733
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:18,107
Well, as someone very
wisely once said,

734
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:21,151
"That's how it is
with cars sometimes."

735
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,195
I just said that.

736
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,613
Oh.

737
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,952
I wonder if your reputation
is altogether true.

738
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,913
What's my reputation?

739
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,374
Oh, I've heard that Jim Douglas

740
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:39,295
is only interested in
fast cars and easy money.

741
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,421
Not true.

742
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:42,339
Oh?

743
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,424
You know something else?

744
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:44,466
What?

745
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,553
When the light hits
you just right,

746
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,764
you're as beautiful as General
Grant on the $50 bill.

747
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:04,653
Oh, dear me.

748
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,869
You want to know the
secret of the little car?

749
00:47:11,953 --> 00:47:14,121
I do, indeed.

750
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:17,207
I'll tell you the secret
of the little car.

751
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,500
No, just a minute.

752
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,172
All right, tell me.

753
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:25,883
It's heart.

754
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,510
That's what it is... Heart.

755
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,888
Heart.

756
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:34,892
Yes, well, I'm certainly going
to make a note of that.

757
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,363
Headache gone?

758
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,447
All gone.

759
00:47:48,531 --> 00:47:52,326
Anticipation of victory is
the purest form of aspirin.

760
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,994
This is my day.

761
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,371
Clear the grid.

762
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,289
Clear the grid, please.

763
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,041
You seem very confident.

764
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:02,211
You know, I believe I am.

765
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:11,136
There is some passing as they
leave the starting grid.

766
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,805
Going for turn one.

767
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,848
Field stretching out now.

768
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,519
Everybody into the
turn went very nicely.

769
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:24,024
Very fine field of cars here,
and coming through traffic now,

770
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,236
making a move is Peter Thorndyke
in the number 14 car,

771
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:29,238
picking up a few
cars in that turn.

772
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,257
Now he comes by and picks up three

773
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,409
more cars, going
into the lead now.

774
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:37,079
Thorndyke leading this
race in car number 14.

775
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,915
Now making a move is car
number 53, Douglas,

776
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,977
who also picks up
about three cars as

777
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:43,836
he goes charging into the traffic,

778
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,673
and is in hot pursuit of
Thorndyke in the number 14 car.

779
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:51,927
As they go down the back-straight,
coming on very hard to pass now

780
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,180
and Douglas, number
53, making the pass.

781
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,308
Attaway, Jimmy boy.

782
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,270
Go, Jimmy. Ha, ha, ha.

783
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:08,402
So far Jim Douglas seems to have
everything pretty much to himself.

784
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,321
He comes through the S's into
turn six well in control.

785
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,425
As we come down the back-straight,

786
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,676
Douglas is slowing down

787
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,846
and Thorndyke goes rocketing
by into the sweeper turn.

788
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:41,018
It looks as though the Douglas
car is having trouble.

789
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,188
Yes, number 53 is fading fast.

790
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,857
It is developing a
problem of some kind.

791
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:57,367
Come in. Come in.

792
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,203
Come in.

793
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,670
Irish coffee.

794
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,709
I'll be here all night if
necessary. Ha, ha, ha.

795
00:50:47,752 --> 00:50:49,169
I can take any amount of this.

796
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,254
Right, there we are.

797
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:52,381
Don't worry, little guy.

798
00:50:52,423 --> 00:50:54,383
You'll be home soon.

799
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:55,592
There we are.

800
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,136
Right, right you are.

801
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,720
Do you mind standing clear?

802
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,264
They want me on my own.

803
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,348
I'll see you in a minute.

804
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:15,779
Poor little fella.

805
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,364
You got a temperature.

806
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,492
Don't worry, Jim
will be back soon.

807
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:24,163
He never would have left if it
hadn't been something important.

808
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,752
I know, nothing worse than
an Irish coffee hangover.

809
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,380
That you, Jim?

810
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,177
Mind if I come in?

811
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,678
Sure, come on.

812
00:51:40,513 --> 00:51:43,098
I wouldn't blame you
if you threw me out.

813
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,850
On account of what Thorndyke did?

814
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:46,935
How can I blame anyone?

815
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,105
Thorndyke ruined the little
car right under my nose.

816
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,446
- Where's Jim?
- Don't know.

817
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,781
He went out as soon
as we got back.

818
00:51:59,824 --> 00:52:01,158
Didn't say a word.

819
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,535
Left Herbie and me flat.

820
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,495
Doesn't he take care of
his car after a race?

821
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,706
Can you do something?

822
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,792
Like what?

823
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,046
Well, help the little car.

824
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,423
I'm not a mechanic, but
I think it's suffering.

825
00:52:18,092 --> 00:52:19,134
Suffering?

826
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,427
Please.

827
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,556
Mind if I use those coveralls?

828
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,766
Right.

829
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:30,646
Oh, look, I want to tell you
so you don't have to worry.

830
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,481
I'm not with Peter
Thorndyke any more.

831
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:34,524
I don't think his way.

832
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,235
Oh, I know that.

833
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,319
How do you know?

834
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,365
Well, Herbie wouldn't
like you, otherwise.

835
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,159
Herbie wouldn't like me?

836
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,328
Miss Bennett...

837
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,497
I gotta level with somebody.

838
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,581
I can't talk to Jim.

839
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,833
Oh, it would destroy him.

840
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,212
You don't know what it was like
before the little car came along.

841
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:57,714
Jim was defeated. It was murder.

842
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,091
He couldn't get a job.

843
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,217
He got into trouble.

844
00:53:00,301 --> 00:53:02,678
Everybody was on his back.

845
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,180
Then Herbie came into his life.

846
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,223
You remember that day?

847
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,725
I remember.

848
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,396
Well, Jim started
winning races again,

849
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,190
he got his self-respect back.

850
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,067
What am I gonna do?

851
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:19,945
Tell him that it was Herbie
winning those races, not him?

852
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,865
Was it Herbie?

853
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,410
Well, I...

854
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,620
You fix the little car.

855
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,914
I'll tell you what's going on.

856
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,292
I didn't know nothing.

857
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,502
Then I went to Tibet.

858
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,338
I plugged into this
contemplation thing...

859
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,886
How's that sound?

860
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,222
Like the song of a bluebird.

861
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,747
Well, the fuel lines are clean,

862
00:53:51,748 --> 00:53:53,562
plugs are clean,
wiring checks out.

863
00:53:53,604 --> 00:53:55,689
Looks like we're in
pretty good shape.

864
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,025
Herbie and I sure appreciate it.

865
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:04,531
You don't believe a word I said
about this little car, do you?

866
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:07,993
Well, there's always a first time.

867
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:13,040
I imagine Adam thought woman was a
pretty funny piece of equipment

868
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,750
when he met Eve.

869
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,460
Well, that's a start.

870
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,045
You can't believe
it all right away.

871
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:19,755
It takes time.

872
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,577
- Well, hello there.
- Hi.

873
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,745
What's this?

874
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,330
You ever see anything
so beautiful?

875
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:54,414
Very nice.

876
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,249
What's the big idea?
You already got a car.

877
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,793
Not after what happened
today I don't.

878
00:54:57,835 --> 00:54:59,878
Ah, shut up. You want
Herbie to hear you?

879
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:02,381
Now don't start that
again, Tennessee.

880
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,175
Look, the El Dorado is coming up.

881
00:55:05,259 --> 00:55:07,086
There are real cars
lined up in there.

882
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:08,678
I need something that can cut it.

883
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,089
Herbie's cut it so far, hasn't he?

884
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,106
Of course he has.

885
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,391
Now, hold it, you two.

886
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,997
I've done great with
this little car

887
00:55:13,998 --> 00:55:15,602
so far, thanks to a
few changes I made

888
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,480
and, if you don't mind, some
pretty fair country driving.

889
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,108
But I gotta stop kidding myself.

890
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,860
I need a big, strong car.

891
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,529
Now I got it.

892
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,158
Don't pay any attention.
Don't even look at it.

893
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:35,914
Hello?

894
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:37,874
Peter Thorndyke here.

895
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,918
Well, well.

896
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:43,004
Yeah, yeah, Thorndyke, I
know what you did to my car.

897
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,506
You need your brains kicked out.

898
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,633
Well, you can imagine
how I must feel.

899
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,202
You see, I'm simply
not responsible

900
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:49,261
when I've been drinking.

901
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,512
You know how it is.

902
00:55:50,596 --> 00:55:51,805
Forget it. And goodbye.

903
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,515
Wait, wait, wait.

904
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,600
I understand from a friend of mine

905
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,019
that you purchased a
new Lamborghini today.

906
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,146
So?

907
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,566
I'm also informed that you owe
a great deal of money on it.

908
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,111
Now, myself, for sentimental
reasons, I like the little car,

909
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:09,364
and I'm perfectly willing to
increase my previous offer

910
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,867
and give you $1,500 for it.

911
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,035
Now, immediately.

912
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,787
I'm in the vicinity.

913
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,956
Thorndyke, I don't like you.

914
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,125
But I can use your money.

915
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:21,877
You got yourself a
deal. Come and get it.

916
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:24,129
What do you mean you
got yourself a deal?

917
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:25,714
- I'm selling the little car.
- You're what?

918
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:28,758
Don't make a fuss.
I need the money.

919
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,761
You crumb. You can't
do that to Herbie.

920
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,182
Carole, will you
tell him how it is?

921
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:37,100
Out in the real world?

922
00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:39,853
Me? Ha.

923
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:43,773
Well, near as I can figure it,
I'm not too smart either.

924
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:46,443
I get rid of one heel just
in time to find another.

925
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,280
Well, now, what happened to you?
I thought you'd be on my side.

926
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,741
Not when you do something
like this to Herbie.

927
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,163
Has everybody gone
nuts around here?

928
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:00,123
I can understand how
Tennessee feels.

929
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,261
He's just in off a
flying saucer. But

930
00:57:02,262 --> 00:57:04,044
you... I thought you made sense.

931
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:08,632
Something tells me it's very, very
wrong to sell that little car.

932
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:11,218
Well, thank you for your opinion,
but what am I supposed to do?

933
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,677
Now, I need the money.

934
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,845
Tennessee, if I don't sell...

935
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,305
Don't talk to me.

936
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,102
I'm sorry.

937
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,771
I shouldn't have butted in.

938
00:57:23,272 --> 00:57:24,731
You're absolutely right.

939
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,650
As a matter of fact,
I don't know...

940
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,693
What are you doing here?

941
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,071
I wish I knew.

942
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:33,532
I really wish I knew.

943
00:57:35,576 --> 00:57:37,034
If I weren't so young
and innocent, a

944
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:38,453
certain thought might
enter my mind.

945
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:41,122
Such as?

946
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:42,874
Such as you went out
with me last night

947
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,960
so that Thorndyke could get
a shot at the little car.

948
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,295
Is that what you think?

949
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:48,922
You gotta admit it's tempting.

950
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,968
Okay. Okay, you want to
know what I was doing here?

951
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,136
Well, I felt sorry about
what happened today.

952
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:58,431
So I quit Thorndyke and came over
here like a full-grown idiot

953
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,642
to find out if I could make
up for it in some way.

954
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:02,602
Well, isn't that a beautiful
thought for the day?

955
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,812
Very touching. Makes me glow.

956
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,817
I think it's just
about time someone

957
00:58:09,818 --> 00:58:11,236
told you what the score is.

958
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,779
You see, Tennessee's
too tender-hearted.

959
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,282
You really think it was
you winning those races?

960
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,242
Yes, I think it was me winning...

961
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:19,077
What do you mean it
wasn't me winning...

962
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:20,245
Pardon me.

963
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:22,096
All right. Do you want me
to tell you something,

964
00:58:22,097 --> 00:58:23,164
my windbag friend?

965
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:25,333
I admit, I didn't believe it
when Tennessee told me before,

966
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,586
but now I see it makes
all kinds of sense.

967
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,004
What?

968
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:30,839
That thimble head of yours
has gotten all swelled up.

969
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:32,591
You're not winning
any of those races.

970
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,302
You couldn't win a game of marbles
from a 12-toed myopic rhinoceros.

971
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:38,013
Let me... Will you knock it
off out there, Tennessee?

972
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:39,264
Can't hear myself think.

973
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:41,600
I'm not out there,
crumb, I'm here.

974
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,935
Well, hold it down. I'll...

975
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,983
Well, then what's this noise?

976
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,363
No.

977
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,201
Stop it. Stop it. You don't
know what you're doing.

978
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:02,871
Look. Look what it did to my car.

979
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:04,706
Okay, okay, maybe it
was a little jealous.

980
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,541
Of course it's jealous.
It's always been jealous

981
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,044
because I get credit for
winning those races.

982
00:59:12,506 --> 00:59:15,050
Go on. Realise what you're saying?

983
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,920
At a time like this,
whatever kind of time it is,

984
00:59:51,962 --> 00:59:54,756
I always say that money
serves to ease the pain.

985
00:59:56,842 --> 00:59:58,677
Good evening, my dear.

986
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,844
Here you are, sir.

987
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:03,098
$1,500 for the small
car, just as I promised.

988
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,016
I note it's not in mint condition,

989
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,644
but I am nothing if not
always a man of my word.

990
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,690
2,000.

991
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,024
What about 2,000?

992
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,945
It's the least I can do to help a
fellow human at a time like this.

993
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:18,655
Shall we consider it a deal?

994
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,285
$2,000?

995
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,829
Yes.

996
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:31,334
$2,000 for that little
beat-up car. Why?

997
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:34,713
Well, I suppose you could say I
have a warm place in my heart

998
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:35,839
for the dear little thing.

999
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:38,466
You don't have a warm
place on your whole body.

1000
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:39,551
What do you want it for?

1001
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,636
You don't want it. I
do. Take the money.

1002
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,724
- You. You, too.
- There's no need to be abusive.

1003
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,142
I'm simply trying to
give you some money.

1004
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,185
I don't want your money. What
do you want the car for?

1005
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,395
Well, I...

1006
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:52,480
You believe it. You
believe it, too.

1007
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,773
Believe what?

1008
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,317
Jim, it don't matter whether
you believe Herbie or not.

1009
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,863
Herbie don't believe
in you no more.

1010
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:01,531
What?

1011
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:07,620
Well, where'd he go? Where is he?

1012
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:09,748
Took off. What do you expect?

1013
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,207
Well, come on, let's find him.

1014
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,877
This is a private thing
between the two of you.

1015
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,003
Good luck.

1016
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:20,258
Herbie.

1017
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,094
Herbie.

1018
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:29,017
A rum lot you've taken
up with, my dear.

1019
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,570
You better find that car
before I do, my friend.

1020
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:41,821
Operator.

1021
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,491
Mobile KQX2942,

1022
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:47,160
I want 567-3998.

1023
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:51,122
Havershaw? I shall
require the personnel

1024
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,708
of both our day and night shifts.

1025
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,002
We have a small task to perform.

1026
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:01,299
Herbie.

1027
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,889
Herbie.

1028
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,230
That's it.

1029
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:10,118
Herbie.

1030
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,150
Excuse me.

1031
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,657
Havershaw, tear it apart.

1032
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:52,702
All right, boys, you heard Mr.
Thorndyke. Tear it apart.

1033
01:03:52,786 --> 01:03:55,496
I'm gonna find out
what makes it tick.

1034
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,170
- After it.
- After it.

1035
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,381
Go on, grab the brute.

1036
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,011
Hang onto it, you fools. Hang on.

1037
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:44,587
Herbie.

1038
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:06,401
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1039
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,076
Give me police station.

1040
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,161
Hello. Police station.

1041
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,362
Herbie.

1042
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,550
Hey, you.

1043
01:06:19,516 --> 01:06:21,142
Did a little car come by here?

1044
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:23,186
Yeah, just did without
paying the...

1045
01:06:36,825 --> 01:06:38,242
No, Herbie. Don't.

1046
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,376
Herbie.

1047
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,845
Herb. Back up.

1048
01:06:58,931 --> 01:06:59,931
Herbie?

1049
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:02,600
Come on, baby, it's gonna be
a beautiful day tomorrow.

1050
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,519
Oh.

1051
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,819
Herbie, give me some help.

1052
01:07:13,737 --> 01:07:14,737
Herb?

1053
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,699
I can't hang on much longer.

1054
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,675
Boy, was he lucky.

1055
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:37,510
This little car saved his life.

1056
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,345
What do you mean, the
car saved his life?

1057
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:42,140
That's what it looked like
for a moment there...

1058
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:49,605
You know how funny things can
look in the fog sometimes.

1059
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,734
I think you've been up on that
Haight-Ashbury beat too long.

1060
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,251
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1061
01:08:13,213 --> 01:08:15,590
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1062
01:08:16,341 --> 01:08:18,718
Swing that light over here.

1063
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,453
Aha.

1064
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:53,211
- What's that thing?
- It's a dried squid, Sergeant.

1065
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,148
- Here's the damages.
- Can you pay it?

1066
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,734
I'm sorry. I have no money.

1067
01:09:16,818 --> 01:09:19,111
Then your car will be impounded.

1068
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:21,822
My guess is, the judge will
order you to sell it at auction

1069
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,366
and the proceeds given to Mr. Wu.

1070
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:24,825
Wait a minute.

1071
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:26,953
May I please speak to
the gentleman, please?

1072
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:30,331
I spent some time up on
a Chinese-type mountain

1073
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:32,250
teaching English to some of them.

1074
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:34,126
You taught English?

1075
01:09:34,586 --> 01:09:39,465
Let's don't get personal. It's a
matter of talking their language.

1076
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,558
You have a little
feel for tradition

1077
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:43,719
and some courtesy,
you'd be surprised.

1078
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,930
You can unscrut the inscrutable.

1079
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:48,349
Go ahead.

1080
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,690
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1081
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:13,958
Ah...

1082
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:15,751
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1083
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,907
- Herbie?
- Herbie.

1084
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:49,910
Oh.

1085
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,620
Oh. Things are shaping up.

1086
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:52,872
He's a car buff.

1087
01:10:52,914 --> 01:10:53,956
Good, good.

1088
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,084
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1089
01:11:01,089 --> 01:11:02,381
Wow.

1090
01:11:02,924 --> 01:11:06,052
- What's the matter?
- We just got a new problem.

1091
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:08,387
He likes the car so much
he wants to keep it.

1092
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:13,635
Okay, the car is
his, but he has to

1093
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,519
let me drive it in the El Dorado.

1094
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,980
Now, if I win, tell him he
gets to keep the prize money,

1095
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,399
but he has to sell Herbie
back to me for a dollar.

1096
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:23,778
Now you speak my language.

1097
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:37,124
Attention, drivers and owners,
report to Mr. Granatelli

1098
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,627
at the president's headquarters.

1099
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,879
Further, you must remain
on the secondary roads,

1100
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:43,798
which have been
posted for this race.

1101
01:11:44,132 --> 01:11:47,009
Other than that, we've tried to
reduce the rules to a minimum.

1102
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,428
Instead of all this technical

1103
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,221
mamby-pamby there's
so much of today,

1104
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:53,057
we're putting the emphasis on
speed, endurance, and courage.

1105
01:11:53,141 --> 01:11:54,141
The way it used to be.

1106
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,272
As you know, this is
open formula racing.

1107
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:01,315
Anything goes.

1108
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,567
Any style of car
and crew you wish.

1109
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,319
The object, gentlemen, is to win.

1110
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,029
I wish you all the
very best of luck.

1111
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:16,205
Tang Wu, I understand that you are
the new owner of the Douglas car.

1112
01:12:16,289 --> 01:12:17,955
As I, too, am interested
in the vehicle,

1113
01:12:17,956 --> 01:12:19,500
I took the liberty
of looking you up.

1114
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:20,543
Thank you.

1115
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:21,792
You will therefore
forgive me, sir,

1116
01:12:21,793 --> 01:12:22,827
when I say that you are perhaps

1117
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,297
not quite as naive as you look.

1118
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:28,342
In point of fact, you are
a very shrewd operator,

1119
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:31,762
one who has managed to acquire,
by one means or another,

1120
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:36,600
legitimate means, of course, a
number of varied enterprises.

1121
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,812
It is truly written, one
cannot lose them all.

1122
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,940
In the light of this, would you
entertain a sizeable wager

1123
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:45,359
on the outcome of the race?

1124
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:46,819
Wager?

1125
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:50,531
The goddess of fortune will always
find me her most ardent suitor.

1126
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:51,866
Splendid, splendid.

1127
01:12:51,908 --> 01:12:54,326
Shall we step in here?
A little more private.

1128
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:57,705
You're Mr. Thorndyke. I've
always wanted to meet you.

1129
01:12:57,789 --> 01:13:00,875
You've heard of me? How charming.

1130
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:05,546
Are you not the gentleman who
originated the idea of small print

1131
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:08,466
on bottom of automobile
sales contract?

1132
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,050
The very same.

1133
01:13:11,928 --> 01:13:13,471
A most worthy adversary.

1134
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:14,638
You are most kind.

1135
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:17,850
And now, sir, the
terms of our wager.

1136
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,394
What would you like?

1137
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:22,646
What have you got?

1138
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,233
Ahem.

1139
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,532
Okay, let's mount up.

1140
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,700
How's our little friend?

1141
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:35,910
I hope it holds together.

1142
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:36,994
Holds together?

1143
01:13:37,078 --> 01:13:40,998
It was so beat up, I had to cut
the frame to straighten it out.

1144
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,084
Excuse me.

1145
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:50,257
Is this the morning bus to Fresno?

1146
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:54,094
Thorndyke, this little car goes so
fast, we need three people inside

1147
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,596
just to hold it on the ground.

1148
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,097
Well, you certainly
picked the right crew.

1149
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,474
Toodle-oo.

1150
01:13:58,558 --> 01:14:00,434
Break a leg, Thorndyke.

1151
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:10,152
Havershaw, I trust you've
not been wasting your time.

1152
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:15,282
Spent a few useful moments
with the small car?

1153
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:17,284
Yes, sir.

1154
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:20,246
Based then on what you now
know, what would you say

1155
01:14:20,288 --> 01:14:22,957
are the chances of victory
for the Douglas car?

1156
01:14:22,999 --> 01:14:26,877
I would say that they range
from slight to impossible.

1157
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:30,965
Havershaw, you are a rat
after my own heart.

1158
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:32,383
Thank you, sir.

1159
01:14:33,885 --> 01:14:36,220
Gentlemen, start your engines.

1160
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:44,455
You're giving it a nice ride.

1161
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:57,885
Okay to uncurl my toes
now? We past everybody?

1162
01:15:57,969 --> 01:16:00,220
Everyone but Thorndyke.

1163
01:16:00,263 --> 01:16:01,513
Let's go to work.

1164
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,308
They're coming up on us, sir.

1165
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:07,436
Well, we're not too
concerned, are we?

1166
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:15,569
Now, Havershaw, aren't we coming
to that rather dangerous,

1167
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,696
oily spot in the road?

1168
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,406
Coming right up, sir.

1169
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,097
Come on, push.

1170
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:44,765
Push, you worm.

1171
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:52,898
Jim, that's water.

1172
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,285
Here we go.

1173
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:10,791
Mr. Thorndyke, that isn't me.

1174
01:17:15,338 --> 01:17:17,131
Give me something
to wipe my goggles.

1175
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:25,180
Havershaw, did you ever
think of having a manicure?

1176
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,268
There they are.

1177
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,937
Now watch me blow
them off the road.

1178
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,819
Who's the guy in the fur coat?

1179
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,615
This is no time for
eating, you fool.

1180
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:45,826
Where are we? How far
is Chinese Camp?

1181
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,036
What's the matter with you?

1182
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:50,164
Don't you even know
how to open a map?

1183
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:29,244
At the moment, the
leaders of the race

1184
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:31,997
are approaching the historic
mining towns of the mother lode.

1185
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,764
In first position,
as he moves past

1186
01:18:34,765 --> 01:18:36,627
checkpoint three, is Jim Douglas.

1187
01:18:36,711 --> 01:18:39,838
Peter Thorndyke, in the special,
has regained his relief driver

1188
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,691
and is rapidly making
up lost ground

1189
01:18:41,692 --> 01:18:43,550
as the two pacemakers
near the famous

1190
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,969
old mining community
of Chinese Camp.

1191
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,558
- Now what?
- I don't know.

1192
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,060
We can't be out of gas this soon.

1193
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:58,440
Here.

1194
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:01,109
Wait a minute. I got a suspicion.

1195
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:03,070
What's the matter?

1196
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:06,073
Just as I thought... Water.

1197
01:19:06,115 --> 01:19:07,533
They did it again.

1198
01:19:14,749 --> 01:19:16,583
Now what do we do?

1199
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:18,418
Give me the map.

1200
01:19:26,177 --> 01:19:27,666
All right, it looks like Chinese

1201
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:29,388
Camp's about three
miles from here.

1202
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:31,056
Now, if we come down the...

1203
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,266
Hey.

1204
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:39,106
What goes?

1205
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:40,899
No sweat, man.

1206
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,568
This is Uncle Wu's car.

1207
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,695
You don't think he'd let
anyone put it down, do you?

1208
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,739
Easy, fellas.

1209
01:19:51,786 --> 01:19:54,288
The Jim Douglas car appears
to have run into trouble.

1210
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:57,207
There has been no sign of
him past checkpoint nine.

1211
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,835
Peter Thorndyke is
refuelling at Chinese Camp.

1212
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,268
Come on, come on, will
you? I'm in a hurry.

1213
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:19,396
Sure thing. I tell father.

1214
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,274
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1215
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,905
My father say hurry is waste.

1216
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:31,617
Waste is cracked bowl,
which never know rice.

1217
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,661
I don't care how cracked
your father's rice bowl is.

1218
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,121
What I want...

1219
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:52,679
Hey. Some of you people
get over here right away.

1220
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,057
Okay, you're on your way.

1221
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:57,017
Hooray. Hooray.

1222
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,936
I'm getting out of here.

1223
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,855
Not full. Can't go yet.

1224
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:03,357
Oh, just you watch me.

1225
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:20,374
As we come to the midway point
in the first day's racing,

1226
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:23,043
Peter Thorndyke, after a
delay at Chinese Camp,

1227
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:25,128
is beginning to catch up
with the rest of the field.

1228
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,444
That knocked him off the
Christmas tree, sir.

1229
01:21:58,162 --> 01:22:01,832
This is our kind of terrain
from here on out, all downhill.

1230
01:22:52,508 --> 01:22:56,053
How true it is that the best ways
are the simplest ways after all.

1231
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:57,262
That's what I always say, sir.

1232
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,680
Oh, shut up.

1233
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,692
We should be coming
soon to what is

1234
01:23:21,693 --> 01:23:23,413
either a rail tunnel or a bridge.

1235
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,665
Oh, here's a tunnel.
That must be it.

1236
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,067
What are you doing?

1237
01:23:52,151 --> 01:23:53,819
It's an elevator.

1238
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:55,904
But Herbie doesn't fit.

1239
01:23:55,988 --> 01:23:57,364
Everybody out.

1240
01:24:02,036 --> 01:24:03,954
No sign of them.

1241
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:07,207
You may open the
wine now, Havershaw.

1242
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:13,880
It's chilled the way
you like it, sir.

1243
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:16,383
All right, give me a hand.

1244
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:18,135
Altogether now.

1245
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:24,933
To you, sir. My
unbounded admiration.

1246
01:24:25,017 --> 01:24:26,059
Thank you.

1247
01:24:27,728 --> 01:24:30,772
You know something
about champagne, sir?

1248
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:35,026
Havershaw, if you tell me that
the bubbles tickle your nose,

1249
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:37,487
I shall probably kill you.

1250
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,448
Eek.

1251
01:24:50,751 --> 01:24:52,627
Get rid of that slop.

1252
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:12,939
Shouldn't that wheel
have come off by now?

1253
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:15,192
It's long overdue, sir.

1254
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:18,153
I'm terribly embarrassed by the
delay. I don't know what...

1255
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,572
Stop whimpering.

1256
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,117
I'll just give them
a friendly nudge.

1257
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,883
Hey, where'd that wheel come from?

1258
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,987
Hold it.

1259
01:26:04,116 --> 01:26:05,867
All right, don't do
anything sudden.

1260
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,161
Is it all right if I
just cry real soft?

1261
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:12,165
Carole, put your feet
back here on the bumper.

1262
01:26:13,709 --> 01:26:14,709
Now give me your hand.

1263
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:18,171
Let go, let go. Give me your hand.

1264
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,382
I'm trying, but my mind
don't get the message.

1265
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:22,509
Come on, come on.

1266
01:26:24,178 --> 01:26:25,595
Now come right over the top.

1267
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:30,058
Atta-boy.

1268
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,278
All right, let's get
the spare wheel

1269
01:26:34,279 --> 01:26:36,231
on and get Herbie
back on the road.

1270
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:42,362
Thorndyke again.

1271
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:44,322
He made a pizza out of it.

1272
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,575
And now, here in Virginia City,

1273
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,995
the terminal point for the
first day of the El Dorado,

1274
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:52,497
we're all looking down
the road from the west.

1275
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,999
And, actually, at any moment now,

1276
01:26:54,041 --> 01:26:56,002
we should be seeing
the car that will

1277
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:58,169
complete the first
half of the El Dorado,

1278
01:26:58,212 --> 01:26:59,629
the run for the gold.

1279
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:01,047
Up in the judges' stand,

1280
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:03,425
the judges and the
timers are ready.

1281
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:04,509
Just a moment.

1282
01:27:05,052 --> 01:27:07,554
The first car is coming
in sight right now.

1283
01:27:07,596 --> 01:27:10,015
He is really flying down the road.

1284
01:27:10,057 --> 01:27:11,099
And there he goes by us.

1285
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:19,524
You making it all
right, Tennessee?

1286
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:29,659
Waah.

1287
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,453
Whoa.

1288
01:27:31,537 --> 01:27:33,038
Stop, Jim, will you?

1289
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,289
Waah.

1290
01:27:34,373 --> 01:27:36,082
Now, don't anybody breathe.

1291
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:39,544
Ready?

1292
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:19,292
Actually, at this hour, only
one car is unaccounted for.

1293
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:22,128
There's been absolutely no
word of the Douglas special,

1294
01:28:22,171 --> 01:28:24,348
which figured so
very prominently in

1295
01:28:24,349 --> 01:28:26,466
the early stages
of the race today.

1296
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:29,427
Well, I see the judges are
closing down for the night,

1297
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,595
and, by golly, so are we,

1298
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,973
but we'll return to the El
Dorado at 7:30 tomorrow morning

1299
01:28:34,016 --> 01:28:36,893
to bring you the start of the
second and the final lap

1300
01:28:36,977 --> 01:28:38,353
back to Yosemite Valley.

1301
01:28:38,437 --> 01:28:39,562
Good night, everyone.

1302
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:05,296
A little bird's nest
soup never hurt anyone.

1303
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:07,090
Thanks.

1304
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:11,052
Oh, thanks.

1305
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:14,305
I hope this holds together. I'm
putting welds on top of welds.

1306
01:29:29,488 --> 01:29:31,739
Mr. Wu, the wiring is
mostly all burned off.

1307
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:34,033
The cylinder walls are scored.
The carburettor is a mess.

1308
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:36,161
The body's sprung.

1309
01:29:37,288 --> 01:29:41,207
This little car ripped itself to
pieces trying to get us here.

1310
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:43,543
It gave us everything it's got.

1311
01:29:43,627 --> 01:29:45,378
Now, maybe we could
patch it back together,

1312
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:47,005
I don't know, but...

1313
01:29:47,047 --> 01:29:50,383
How can I send it back into
that rat race tomorrow?

1314
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:52,677
It's got nothing left to give.

1315
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:00,351
It's your car.

1316
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:02,437
What do you say?

1317
01:30:09,361 --> 01:30:12,697
A wise man once said...

1318
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:16,784
"When you come to last page,

1319
01:30:17,244 --> 01:30:18,912
"close the book."

1320
01:31:01,872 --> 01:31:05,416
You let that little car get
under your skin, didn't you?

1321
01:31:06,293 --> 01:31:07,752
I don't know.

1322
01:31:11,048 --> 01:31:13,967
There's a lot of gloop
been written about it.

1323
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:17,345
The bond between a man
and his automobile

1324
01:31:19,431 --> 01:31:22,892
and how he hates it sometimes,
mostly, how he loves it.

1325
01:31:24,478 --> 01:31:28,982
Showers gifts on it in the way
of accessories and all that.

1326
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:33,528
He gets hysterical if
somebody scratches the paint

1327
01:31:33,612 --> 01:31:37,240
or makes it lose
face on the freeway.

1328
01:31:40,202 --> 01:31:44,330
Maybe some of those feelings got
into the machinery, I don't know.

1329
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,834
Tennessee thinks so.

1330
01:31:48,919 --> 01:31:49,919
Don't you?

1331
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:58,052
There is something real
about that little car,

1332
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:00,847
something that doesn't
even have a name.

1333
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,900
What I don't understand is, out of

1334
01:32:06,901 --> 01:32:09,188
the millions of
people in the world,

1335
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:12,358
why it picked a dog-eared
second-rater like me.

1336
01:32:16,947 --> 01:32:18,948
You stood up for it once.

1337
01:32:20,367 --> 01:32:22,994
I guess it thought you were

1338
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:24,746
worth belonging to.

1339
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:31,210
I understand that.

1340
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:50,396
Ah, Douglas.

1341
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:51,731
Didn't mean to disturb you.

1342
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:53,733
We'll just take the car and go.

1343
01:32:53,817 --> 01:32:55,234
Take the car? What are
you talking about?

1344
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,655
I understand that you
are out of the race.

1345
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,531
What does that have
to do with you?

1346
01:33:00,574 --> 01:33:03,325
Speaking as the new
owner of the car, I

1347
01:33:03,326 --> 01:33:05,870
regard your question
as impertinent.

1348
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,497
I'm going to hoist it
up and drag it out.

1349
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:09,165
Hold it.

1350
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:12,418
Who said you were the
new owner of the car?

1351
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:14,420
Perhaps Mr. Wu would
like to explain

1352
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:17,674
how he wagered the car on
the outcome of the race.

1353
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:21,969
Even as you, I believed
in the little car.

1354
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:24,472
I thought it would win.

1355
01:33:25,599 --> 01:33:29,060
More honestly, I could
not resist the odds.

1356
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,063
Thank you.

1357
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,400
Good sir,

1358
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:38,611
would you say that
this is a compact car?

1359
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,448
You do not answer.

1360
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:45,993
Well, let me tell you that you
have never seen a compact car

1361
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:48,079
until you see what I'm
going to do with this.

1362
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:51,833
Mr. Douglas, I have a
friend with a claw and hook

1363
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:54,919
auto wrecking company
in San Francisco,

1364
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:57,672
and he's going to
work on your car.

1365
01:33:57,756 --> 01:34:00,007
Maybe he'll transform
it into a birdbath.

1366
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:04,637
Or what about a nice doormat so I
can wipe my feet on it every day?

1367
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:08,224
Well, it's too bad this thing
doesn't have the gumption

1368
01:34:08,308 --> 01:34:10,476
to get up to the starting
line this morning.

1369
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:13,146
I should've enjoyed beating it.

1370
01:34:13,188 --> 01:34:14,397
Oh.

1371
01:34:14,481 --> 01:34:15,815
Why, you...

1372
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:17,400
Take your hand...
Get your hands off.

1373
01:34:21,697 --> 01:34:24,198
Ooh.

1374
01:34:42,926 --> 01:34:45,887
Stop. Herbie, stop.

1375
01:34:48,098 --> 01:34:49,640
Hey, you know something?

1376
01:34:49,683 --> 01:34:51,100
Small car very angry.

1377
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:53,603
And very strong.

1378
01:34:54,104 --> 01:34:56,272
The strength of 40 horses.

1379
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:58,357
What do you think about
that race coming up?

1380
01:34:59,818 --> 01:35:05,782
You know... I think now is chance
to remove egg fu Yung off face.

1381
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:10,119
Well, this morning, the second and
the final lap of the El Dorado,

1382
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:14,290
from Virginia City to Yosemite,
the run for the gold.

1383
01:35:14,374 --> 01:35:16,751
Out there, we see in first
position and all ready to go,

1384
01:35:16,835 --> 01:35:20,588
Peter Thorndyke in his
Thorndyke special.

1385
01:35:28,722 --> 01:35:30,223
Don't worry... Hey.

1386
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:33,059
Whoa.

1387
01:35:33,143 --> 01:35:34,668
These mechanics have done a real

1388
01:35:34,669 --> 01:35:36,479
fine job in keying
these engines up.

1389
01:35:36,647 --> 01:35:37,647
Come on, baby.

1390
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:39,565
Come on, save it for the race.

1391
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:42,318
One more foul-up like this,
Douglas, you're disqualified.

1392
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:46,113
It seemed to be trying
to get at us, sir.

1393
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:47,907
Of course it was, Havershaw.

1394
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,867
It's no use trying
to blink the fact.

1395
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,911
It's either us or it this time.

1396
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:02,004
We're now getting reports from
our checkpoint number 14,

1397
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:04,423
and this one tells us
that the Thorndyke car

1398
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:07,593
is still holding first
position at this time.

1399
01:36:07,636 --> 01:36:09,637
And while here in Virginia City,

1400
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:12,348
we're preparing to dispatch
the last of our contestants.

1401
01:36:12,432 --> 01:36:14,392
That would be the Jim
Douglas special.

1402
01:36:14,893 --> 01:36:17,854
Hang tight. This may
be a fast take-off.

1403
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:22,066
Now.

1404
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:03,357
Good stuff, Herb.

1405
01:37:03,442 --> 01:37:05,401
No more shortcuts like
that last one, Jim.

1406
01:37:05,485 --> 01:37:07,778
Oh, this won't be anything
like that last one.

1407
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:32,511
Thorndyke.

1408
01:37:32,596 --> 01:37:35,222
Nice going, Herbie.
We've almost got him.

1409
01:37:35,307 --> 01:37:36,807
Hooray.

1410
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:47,818
What fool laid out these streets?

1411
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:49,028
But you're driving superbly.

1412
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:54,617
Hey. You got something against
driving on the streets?

1413
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,081
Any sign of them?

1414
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:01,499
Not a glimmer, sir.

1415
01:38:05,545 --> 01:38:06,879
Very well, then.

1416
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:09,548
Now I've finished being
generous George.

1417
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:25,731
He's moving up.

1418
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:38,476
There are times like this when I

1419
01:38:38,477 --> 01:38:40,913
really don't like
myself very much.

1420
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:45,668
What happened to it?

1421
01:38:45,752 --> 01:38:49,338
I'd say it's gone for that
last big lube job up yonder.

1422
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:56,220
Ow. Ow.

1423
01:38:57,764 --> 01:38:59,306
Whoa.

1424
01:39:25,417 --> 01:39:26,667
Here it comes again, sir.

1425
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:31,297
Havershaw, I am not a cowardly
man, but I am beginning to sense

1426
01:39:31,381 --> 01:39:33,299
that that thing is out to get me.

1427
01:39:33,341 --> 01:39:34,967
Now, none of that, sir.

1428
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:36,761
We're not losing
our nerve, are we?

1429
01:39:36,803 --> 01:39:39,346
Blast you, Havershaw. How
dare you patronise me.

1430
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:41,223
I am not losing my nerve.

1431
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:44,101
No, sir. No, sir. Of
course not, sir. No, no.

1432
01:39:54,446 --> 01:39:58,115
I think Herbie did something
to himself that last fall.

1433
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,201
What do you mean?

1434
01:40:00,285 --> 01:40:01,744
Well...

1435
01:40:01,828 --> 01:40:05,122
Like maybe he won't hang
together much longer.

1436
01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:15,466
Yeow.

1437
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:23,182
What happened to Thorndyke?

1438
01:40:23,266 --> 01:40:25,768
I don't know. It was
like he disappeared.

1439
01:40:27,687 --> 01:40:29,271
Do you hear something?

1440
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:31,690
Sounds like one of the cylinders.

1441
01:40:31,733 --> 01:40:34,360
That's impossible. The
cylinders are in the back.

1442
01:40:34,444 --> 01:40:36,695
That's a point I find puzzling.

1443
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:39,281
Get me out of here.

1444
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:46,872
- Oh, my goodness.
- Get that side.

1445
01:40:46,915 --> 01:40:49,708
Oh. Ooh.

1446
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:54,213
Here. Turn him around.

1447
01:40:54,297 --> 01:40:56,882
Okay, on your way.

1448
01:40:58,176 --> 01:40:59,593
Let's go.

1449
01:41:06,726 --> 01:41:07,852
Havershaw.

1450
01:41:09,896 --> 01:41:12,606
The leaders have now passed
the final checkpoint.

1451
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:14,525
We're now moving outside and
we should be seeing them

1452
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:16,235
at the finish line in
a very few minutes.

1453
01:41:16,278 --> 01:41:18,195
The word is the Douglas
car is in the lead,

1454
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:20,739
but the Thorndyke
car is moving up.

1455
01:41:35,922 --> 01:41:39,967
Oh. I think we got a problem.

1456
01:41:41,303 --> 01:41:43,512
Carole, turn around.

1457
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:48,601
Grab hold of that strap and pull.

1458
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:03,949
Ooh.

1459
01:42:03,992 --> 01:42:05,576
You okay?

1460
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:06,702
Fine.

1461
01:42:07,954 --> 01:42:09,997
Look. There's another one.

1462
01:42:10,081 --> 01:42:11,999
I got it.

1463
01:42:14,586 --> 01:42:15,794
What goes on?

1464
01:42:15,837 --> 01:42:17,463
Just keep driving.

1465
01:42:17,547 --> 01:42:21,050
Try not to think about
what I'm doing.

1466
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:24,637
Well, that's that.

1467
01:42:24,721 --> 01:42:26,138
Yaah.

1468
01:42:28,975 --> 01:42:30,601
I can't weld that.

1469
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,520
Give me your hand.

1470
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:38,651
What are we gonna do, jump?

1471
01:42:38,985 --> 01:42:41,070
- No, pull.
- Why?

1472
01:42:42,989 --> 01:42:44,323
Whoa.

1473
01:42:44,407 --> 01:42:47,868
Whoa. Jim, help.

1474
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:50,871
I think you better stop
before someone gets hurt.

1475
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:56,669
No dice. Herbie
doesn't want to stop.

1476
01:43:04,177 --> 01:43:05,177
There it is.

1477
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:08,305
I'll bomb the thing off the
road once and for all.

1478
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:30,202
Rotten sportsmanship,
if you ask me.

1479
01:43:30,578 --> 01:43:32,417
Here at the finish,
we're still waiting

1480
01:43:32,418 --> 01:43:34,164
for our first glimpse
of the leaders.

1481
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:40,296
Yes. Yes, there they are.

1482
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,090
The Thorndyke car now seems
to have a slight edge

1483
01:43:43,174 --> 01:43:46,010
on the Douglas car, which
is hanging right in there.

1484
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:48,721
You have him now,
sir. Don't falter.

1485
01:43:48,763 --> 01:43:52,558
I'm not going to
falter, you dimwit.

1486
01:44:07,699 --> 01:44:11,410
Good-o, sir, good-o.
You can't lose.

1487
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:14,538
You can't possibly lo...

1488
01:44:37,562 --> 01:44:40,606
- We won. We won.
- Ha, ha, ha.

1489
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:43,776
The little car takes first...

1490
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:45,444
And third place.

1491
01:44:46,196 --> 01:44:48,364
Whoa.

1492
01:45:10,303 --> 01:45:11,720
Come on. Give us a picture.

1493
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:18,685
Beautiful. One more.

1494
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:20,479
What? Kiss? You
better believe that.

1495
01:45:20,563 --> 01:45:22,064
- Oh.
- Come here.

1496
01:45:39,707 --> 01:45:42,668
"Couldn't lose," I think you said.

1497
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:46,380
I don't like to remind you, sir,
but if only you'd read the terms

1498
01:45:46,464 --> 01:45:48,424
of that stupid wager
you made with Mr. Wu.

1499
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:50,467
Havershaw, you're despicable.

1500
01:45:58,351 --> 01:46:01,520
Havershaw, I shan't pretend I
don't know what you're thinking.

1501
01:46:02,188 --> 01:46:05,983
However, I pride myself on being
a good judge of character,

1502
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:08,735
and when I ask myself,
"Could this man be capable

1503
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:13,073
"of such an act of
pettiness and base...

1504
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:17,035
"Base ingratitude." I
accept that as your answer.

1505
01:46:21,749 --> 01:46:23,333
Ha, ha...

1506
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:29,631
Thanks, Herbie. So long, Mr. Wu.

1507
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:30,924
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Wu.

1508
01:46:31,009 --> 01:46:33,677
- Bye, Tennessee.
- So long, Jim.

1509
01:46:35,054 --> 01:46:36,642
It's none of my
business, but where

1510
01:46:36,643 --> 01:46:38,098
are you going on your honeymoon?

1511
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:40,726
We don't know. Herb
hasn't told us yet.

1512
01:46:41,936 --> 01:46:43,145
Let's go, Herb.

1513
01:46:46,357 --> 01:46:48,358
Goodbye, Herbie.
