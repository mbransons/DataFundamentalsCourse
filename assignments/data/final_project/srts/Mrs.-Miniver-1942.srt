1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,798
East Hill bus.

3
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,598
- All right, lady, on or off, please.
- Oh, yes.

4
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,955
- That's all. Next bus!
- Fares, please.

5
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,553
- Beverly Crescent?
- Who?

6
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,917
- Beverly Crescent.
- Get off next stop, take number 19.

7
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,718
- Fares, please.
- I'm sorry, conductor.

8
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,553
- Would you mind stopping?
- Leaving us already?

9
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,631
It's in the opposite direction.

10
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,554
That's about the only place
we don't go, lady. Fares, please.

11
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,352
- Why, Mrs. Miniver.
- You know, I...

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,195
Don't tell me it's gone.

13
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,477
Just a minute.

14
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,435
Oh, I was so afraid you'd sold it.

15
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,034
No. We knew you'd come back.

16
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,714
I know it's foolish and extravagant...

17
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,677
...but I've simply got to have it.

18
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,196
Yes, pack it up quickly,
don't give me time to think.

19
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,590
Oh, careful, careful.

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,150
Why, vicar. This is nice.

21
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,313
- For me. Let me put those on the rack.
- Thank you.

22
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,998
Oh, no, not this one. I might leave
it behind, and it's rather precious.

23
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,549
Yes, I know the feeling.

24
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,472
Guess what this is.

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,479
- Port.
- Worse than that.

26
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,313
- Cigars.
- Well, why not? My husband does.

27
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,391
- He can afford it.
- I'm not so sure.

28
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,438
- He has a very extravagant wife.
- Nonsense.

29
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,956
It's quite true. I can't help it.
I'm afraid I do like nice things.

30
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,749
Things far beyond my means sometimes.
Oh, pretty clothes...

31
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,913
...and good schools for the children,
the car, the garden, you know.

32
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,152
- Yes, I know.
- Does it give you a lovely guilty feeling?

33
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,117
- Lovely.
- Oh, vicar!

34
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,510
Fellow sinners. What
will the village say?

35
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,956
Oh, I think the village knows
you're a very understanding person.

36
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,033
- That's why you do so much good.
- Well, I hope I do.

37
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,838
I hope I can when they need me.

38
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,954
You mean, you think
there is trouble coming?

39
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,992
I think it's here.

40
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,514
- Good evening, Lady Beldon.
- Good evening, vicar.

41
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,238
Good evening.

42
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,753
Oh, shopping's impossible nowadays.
You can't get near the counter...

43
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,754
...and when you do, they haven't got
it and you pay twice as much for it.

44
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,879
- What a wonderful description.
- Sit down, Simpson. And don't sniff!

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,033
I spent the whole afternoon being
pushed around by middle-class females...

46
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,317
...buying things they can't afford.
- Oh, dear, that means me.

47
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,313
Oh, no, much worse. You're
Mrs. Mannering, aren't you?

48
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,391
- Miniver.
- Oh, yes. The lawyer's wife.

49
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,075
- No, my husband's an architect.
- I knew he was something of that sort.

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,435
I don't know what
the country's coming to.

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,512
Everyone trying to be better
than their betters.

52
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,399
No wonder Germany's arming.

53
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,233
- Good evening, your ladyship.
- Good evening, Ballard.

54
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,869
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Mr. Ballard.

55
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,270
Dear, this bag. Vicar, do go on, please.

56
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,919
- Well, goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

57
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,354
Thank you.

58
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,830
- I was looking for you on the 5:00.
- I missed it by two minutes.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,595
- Isn't that shameful?
- Well, time and tide waits for no man.

60
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,239
And trains neither.

61
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,153
Are you too late, ma'am,
to spare me a moment?

62
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,470
- I got something to show you.
- Well, I...

63
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,279
It's something very special.

64
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,596
Well, of course, Mr. Ballard.
Do show me.

65
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,716
This way, ma'am.

66
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,232
Thank you.

67
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,391
Oh, Mr. Ballard.

68
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,916
It's my masterpiece.

69
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,113
How lovely.

70
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,431
You like it, ma'am?

71
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,957
I think it's the most beautiful rose
I've ever seen.

72
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,918
- The shape.
- And the scent.

73
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,511
Divine. And the color...

74
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,069
I adore red roses.

75
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,834
'Tis said, as Cupid danced among the gods,
he down the nectar flung...

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,358
...which on the white rose being shed,
made it forever after red.

77
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,712
- Wherever did you find that?
- Hutter's seed catalog, ma'am.

78
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,838
It's pretty, but it ain't true.

79
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,234
What goes to make a rose,
ma'am, is breeding...

80
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,951
...and budding and horse manure,
if you'll pardon the expression.

81
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,396
- And that's where you come in, ma'am.
- I?

82
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,636
I gotta have a name for it.

83
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,588
- Oh, you want me to name it for you.
- No, ma'am, I got a name for it...

84
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,514
...if you'll give me your permission.
- Why, of course. But I don't see...

85
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,468
I want to call it the "Mrs. Miniver".

86
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,593
If you'll pardon me, ma'am...

87
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,275
...I've watched you go in
and out of town for years now...

88
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,319
...and you've always had time to stop
and have a word with me...

89
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,790
...and I've always waited
for you to come home...

90
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,315
...and you remind me of the flower.

91
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,518
And I figured it'd be
a very good name for my rose.

92
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,916
It's a lovely compliment, Mr. Ballard.

93
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,675
I'd be very happy indeed to have
you name your rose after me.

94
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,873
Well...

95
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,239
I really must go now. I'm terribly
late already. Goodbye, Mr. Ballard...

96
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,836
...and thank you. Thank you very much.
- No, no, no, thank you.

97
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,437
I think it's lovely having
flowers named after you.

98
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,273
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

99
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,072
Thank you!

100
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,077
That's my wife.

101
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,076
- Good as new?
- Well, almost, sir.

102
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,032
It's a nice car, but afraid it's
a little more than I can afford.

103
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,111
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

104
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,073
We have some nice cars
in a cheaper bracket.

105
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,391
But I like this one.

106
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,518
Well, I'm going to take it.

107
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,796
- Perhaps you'd better think it over.
- No, I'm going to take it.

108
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,235
- Will you bring it tonight?
- Very good, sir.

109
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,198
And don't let my wife
know how much it cost.

110
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,869
- Hello, Judy!
- Daddy!

111
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,314
Good evening.

112
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,552
Mr. Miniver, you're just in time
to hear Judy play her piece.

113
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,280
- But I'm afraid...
- It'd encourage her so much.

114
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,750
- Encourage both of us, in fact.
- I'm a little late. Next time.

115
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,831
- See you later, Judy.
- Bye, Daddy.

116
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,555
- What's the hurry, Toby?
- I can't stop, Daddy.

117
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,156
- Napoleon wants to throw up.
- Oh, does he?

118
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,037
I wouldn't dare tell you the price, though.
I feel terribly guilty about it.

119
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,795
I was already on my way home and
something seemed to come over me...

120
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,838
...a sort of trance. I got off the bus...
- Hello, darling.

121
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,389
- Oh, Clem.
- How are you?

122
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,519
That's Clem, dear.
As I was saying, I got off the bus...

123
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,071
...and I suddenly remembered that
Vin was due down from Oxford tomorrow.

124
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,358
Yes, Vin, dear, tomorrow.
Isn't that exciting?

125
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,239
And so we're all going down
to the station to see him.

126
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,674
Isn't that wonderful?

127
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,515
Sophie, you idiot, Clem was
standing right here beside me.

128
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,272
Of course I haven't told him.

129
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,989
You don't just throw
things like that at a man.

130
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,596
Well, there wasn't any connection,
I just had to say something.

131
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,837
Well, I'll probably tell him
after dinner tonight.

132
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,389
He's usually most docile
when having his coffee.

133
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,869
May we go to the station
and meet Vin tomorrow?

134
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,996
Of course, darling, if you're good.

135
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,470
Is Vin still a vege...?
"Vegetenarian", Mother?

136
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,074
I doubt it, darling.
He'll have some new idea.

137
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,515
That was just a phase
he was going through.

138
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,593
- What's a phase?
- Oh, it's just a thing people go through.

139
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,911
- Do I go through it?
- Yes, you're going through one now.

140
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,359
Am I? I'm going through a phase!
I'm going through a phase!

141
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,556
Stop waving your arms and finish supper.

142
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,030
- What phase will he be going through?
- We'll have to wait and see.

143
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,191
Darling, I mustn't keep Daddy waiting.

144
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,555
Good night, sweetheart.
Be a good girl.

145
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,112
Could I run down to the post, ma'am?
Cook says she'll clear.

146
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,750
Well, of course, Gladys,
but don't let Horace keep you out too late.

147
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,878
Rather a dashing fellow,
young Horace Perkins, eh, Gladys?

148
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,473
Sir!

149
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,511
- You know, Kay, I...
- You know, Clem, I...

150
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,672
- I'm sorry. Go ahead, dear.
- No, what were you going to say?

151
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,277
Nothing important. I just wondered if
you had a nice time in town, that was all.

152
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,830
Oh, wonderful.
I shopped and shopped.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,719
Just little things, you know.

154
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,991
Oh, I had a puncture in the car today.

155
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,878
Oh, no, what a shame.

156
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,191
Tires are getting pretty worn
on that old bus.

157
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,119
- Clem, you know what I think?
- What?

158
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,999
I think you ought
to buy yourself a new tire.

159
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,513
A new tire?

160
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,148
Yes, it might not be a bad idea,
at that.

161
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,675
They aren't so frightfully expensive,
are they?

162
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,516
- Oh, I guess we can swing it all right.
- A new tire shouldn't cost more...

163
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,831
...than a new hat, should it?
- A hat?

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,198
Well, I just said hat. I might have
said shoes or trousers or anything.

165
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,750
- Some more coffee, dear?
- I have some, thank you, darling.

166
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,753
Yeah.

167
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,878
That old bus. Pretty sad.

168
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,595
Been giving a lot of trouble lately.

169
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,276
- Has it? I hadn't noticed it.
- That's the danger with an old car.

170
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,432
You don't notice anything,
then when you're doing 70 miles...

171
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,195
- Not with our car, dear.
- And that's another thing. It's too slow.

172
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,512
- That car is dangerously slow.
- Clem, what have you been up to?

173
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,790
Come on. Get your coat and hat on.
I've got something to show you.

174
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,232
Smooth, isn't she?

175
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,709
- You all right, darling?
- Yes.

176
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,631
I was afraid you'd think
I'd been a bit too extravagant.

177
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,270
Oh, all of us are extravagant
now and then, don't you think?

178
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,591
Of course. It's fun. What's
the use of having a little money...

179
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,550
...if once in a while you can't be reckless
with it on something you really want.

180
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,598
Where are you going?

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,468
After all, what is money?

182
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,316
It's the power to buy ourselves
something that'll make us happier.

183
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,789
You shouldn't be a slave to it, though.

184
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,075
Say, what are you doing, anyway?

185
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,471
- What on earth is that?
- Do you like it?

186
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,232
Do you?

187
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,196
I bought it today.

188
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,352
Isn't it lovely?

189
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,794
Not bad.

190
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,235
I do think it does
something for me, don't you?

191
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,960
- Yes, it makes you look rather ridiculous.
- Clem.

192
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,429
Maybe it's this gown.
Doesn't quite go with it.

193
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,036
Yes, but just look at the hat itself.
And if I've had my hair done...

194
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,590
...it'd look different.
- Yeah, it would be a difference.

195
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,318
Yes, it's very pretty.

196
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,914
Good! Then I think it
was worth the money.

197
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,914
- Much?
- Not for people with a car like ours.

198
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,516
- You're pretty clever, aren't you?
- I hope you think so, darling.

199
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,069
Kay, sit down here a minute.

200
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,271
Let me look at you.

201
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,952
- You're really quite beautiful, aren't you?
- Lf you think so, darling.

202
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,598
I think you're even more
beautiful than when I married you.

203
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,116
- Could that be?
- I don't see why not.

204
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,396
I've had more reason to be.

205
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,674
Put that silly thing away
and get into bed, now.

206
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,799
Come on, don't stand
looking at it all night.

207
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,633
- In you go, there.
- It's been a lovely day, hasn't it?

208
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,233
Yes.

209
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,112
Clem, I think we're very lucky people.

210
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,475
Because we've got a new car
and a new hat?

211
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,756
Oh, much more than that.

212
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,390
Because of Vin and Toby and Judy...

213
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,553
...and each other.
- Yeah.

214
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,793
Clem.

215
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,397
Guess what.

216
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,756
I had a rose named after me today.

217
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,713
You left the light on
in the dressing room tonight.

218
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,473
Good night, Clem.

219
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,471
Good night, dear.

220
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,510
- There he is!
- There he is!

221
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,279
- Hello, Mother!
- Hello, Vin!

222
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,839
Vin, darling!

223
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,797
- Hello, Dad!
- Fine to have you back.

224
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,679
Judy! Hello, Toby! Toby!

225
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,876
Vin! Vin's got a pipe!

226
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,554
- What of it, young fellow?
- Heavens, you've grown!

227
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,393
- Only about half an inch, Mother.
- I've grown a yard!

228
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,959
Have you, Toby?

229
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,271
- Where's the mustache, son?
- You used to be so proud of it.

230
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,000
- I don't remember being so very proud.
- I liked it.

231
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,469
Sorry. I found it took
up too much of my time.

232
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,313
- Oh, it did?
- Keeping it trim and all that.

233
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,836
After all, one can't waste too much
time over the vanities of life.

234
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,072
I see. Well, come along,
children. We better get along.

235
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,913
Let's go. Here we go.

236
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,840
Oh, good heavens.

237
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,997
So your interest doesn't
center on cars anymore, Vin?

238
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,835
Well, this last year at Oxford,
I've rather changed my outlook on things.

239
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,958
- You don't say.
- Yes. I think I've grown a little.

240
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,271
Matured in my conception
as to what life's about.

241
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,119
- Do you know what Oxford taught me?
- What, dear?

242
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,592
- That I know nothing about anything.
- Rather a waste of time and money.

243
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,957
Not at all, because it's shown
me just what I want out of life.

244
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,758
- And what's that, Vin?
- To learn.

245
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,230
I want to encompass all the knowledge
I can in my brief span.

246
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,709
- What's "span", Vin?
- It's a bridge.

247
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,519
- A bridge?
- I think of the amount of knowledge...

248
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,036
...in the world: Scientific knowledge,
philosophical, sociological.

249
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,830
And when I realize the infinitesimal part
of this I possess, it makes me shudder.

250
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,312
And apart from all that, Mother,
I think I've developed a social consciousness.

251
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,314
- What's that, Vin?
- It's the recognition of my fellow man.

252
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,073
Where are there free men today...

253
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,800
...any more than in the 9th
to the 15th centuries?

254
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,234
Front door, Gladys.

255
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,915
Look, the 9th to 15th centuries,
when the lords held all the land...

256
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,799
...and parceled out what
they wished to their vassals.

257
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,234
Look about. What have we?

258
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,439
As pure a feudalistic state as there ever
was in the 9th through 15th centuries.

259
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,717
When I think about it,
I'm appalled, genuinely appalled.

260
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,279
I tell you, Father...

261
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,871
when I think of the class system
that exists in this country to...

262
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,199
- What is it, Gladys?
- Oh, it's Miss Beldon to see you, ma'am.

263
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,430
Well, show her in, Gladys.

264
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,750
Miss Beldon. I wonder what that means.

265
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,799
Probably brought the latest ultimatum
from her illustrious grandmother.

266
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,678
I scarcely know Lady Beldon.

267
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,070
The perfect example of
what I've been saying.

268
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,791
Lady Beldon is the living proof of
the survival of the feudal system today.

269
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,829
You can't escape the Beldon influence.
It contaminates the entire village society.

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,595
- Just as in the 9th to the 15th centuries.
- Exactly.

271
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,069
How do you do, Mrs. Miniver?
I'm Carol Beldon.

272
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,708
How do you do, Miss Beldon?
This is my husband.

273
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,757
- How do you do?
- And my son Vincent.

274
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,480
- How do you do?
- Just in time for tea, Miss Beldon.

275
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,154
- Thanks, but I've just had some.
- Sit down anyway.

276
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,995
I can only stay a moment.
Please, do sit down.

277
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,031
You really must excuse me
for invading your house like this...

278
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,555
...but frankly,
I've come to make a request.

279
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,315
- A personal request, and a great favor.
- Well, please, sit down.

280
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,754
Thank you.

281
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,480
You see, my grandmother
doesn't know I've come.

282
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,838
I'm afraid I'm not very good
at breaking things gently...

283
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,276
...so I'll get straight to the point.
It's about the rose.

284
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,034
- The rose?
- Yes. The one Mr. Ballard grew.

285
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,713
The Mrs. Miniver.

286
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,599
I hear he's going to enter
it in the flower show.

287
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,036
- For the Beldon Challenge Cup?
- Yes.

288
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,317
- But no one ever has entered... That is...
- No...

289
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,916
...no one has ever entered a rose
in competition with my grandmother.

290
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,479
And that's just the point.

291
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,108
It's become a tradition
for her to win the cup...

292
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,874
...and her roses mean so much to her.

293
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,679
I know it seems an awful thing to ask...

294
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,513
...but I thought you might,
perhaps, as a favor...

295
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,355
...persuade Mr. Ballard to withdraw
his rose from the competition.

296
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,150
To be frank, it's such a beautiful rose
it might easily win, and, well...

297
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,753
Miss Beldon...

298
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,759
...may I ask whether this
is an open competition?

299
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,708
- Yes, technically...
- Technically, yes, but actually, no.

300
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,998
- Yes, I suppose that's it. You see...
- I see only too well, Miss Beldon.

301
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,594
Because Mr. Ballard
is not of the ruling class...

302
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,311
...is a mere vassal, as it were...
- Vin, please. Let Miss Beldon explain.

303
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,472
But, Mother, Miss Beldon doesn't
have to explain, not to me.

304
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,837
I'm aware of the influence of
the feudal system in this village.

305
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,754
These are orders from the manor.
Her ladyship must have no competition.

306
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,480
You must excuse my son.
He's just down from Oxford.

307
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,950
Don't apologize for me.
I mean everything I say.

308
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,954
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
but do you do anything about it?

309
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,271
Do? Why, what do you mean?

310
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,115
If you feel something is wrong,
what are you doing about it?

311
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,872
I've spent holidays the last few years
doing settlement work in London slums.

312
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,713
- You wallow in luxury all the year...
- I don't wallow!

313
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,314
...and think a few weeks
playing Lady Bountiful...

314
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,436
- Come, Vin.
- It's not much, perhaps...

315
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,750
...but it's the only thing I know.

316
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,754
- What have you been doing?
- I?

317
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,071
- Well...
- I see. Just talk.

318
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,959
- That's all right. It's easier.
- Listen, I didn't say...

319
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,712
Oh, don't apologize.

320
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,555
I know how comfortable it is to curl
up with a book full of big words...

321
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,917
...and think you're going to solve
the problems of the universe.

322
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,277
But you're not. A bit of action
is required now and then.

323
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,398
Action? If that's what you
and your class are asking for...

324
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,553
...maybe you'll get it one of these days.
- Maybe. But not from the talkers.

325
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,315
Vin! Remember, Miss Beldon is a guest.
If you have any manners at all...

326
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,916
Manners? A humble working man
is denied the reward of his artistry...

327
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,959
...to gratify the vanity of an aristocrat...
- Quiet. This isn't your concern.

328
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,032
I beg to differ. I'm concerned
for a fellow man's dignity.

329
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,760
And the indignity
that's heaped upon him.

330
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,789
- You'll excuse me, I'm sure, Miss Beldon.
- Certainly.

331
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,915
- I must apologize for Vin.
- Oh, no, please, it's all right.

332
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,958
And besides, he's rather nice, isn't he?

333
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,519
- What?
- Well...

334
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,671
Really, you know, he's perfectly right.

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,479
I have not a leg to stand on
in this business.

336
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,073
I shouldn't have asked you.

337
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,913
I realized that before the words
were out of my mouth.

338
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,231
It's just that my grandmother's
over 80 and takes such pride...

339
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,550
...in winning year after year.
- Of course.

340
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,836
But please forget I
said anything about it.

341
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,672
Anyhow, I'm glad we met at last.

342
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,752
- I hope we see more of each other.
- I hope so too.

343
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,673
- You'll be at the sailing club dance?
- Oh, yes.

344
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,070
- Good. I'll see you there, then.
- Goodbye.

345
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,152
To hear people, you'd think
Mr. Ballard committed a crime.

346
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,278
I don't hold with people
getting ideas above their station.

347
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,193
Who's he to think he can
enter his rose in the show?

348
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,352
- And who's to say he can't?
- Nobody's ever entered a rose...

349
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,275
...against Lady Beldon since she started
30 years ago. Keep a civil tongue...

350
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,273
...or I'll be doing my shopping
in Meekham after this!

351
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,592
My opinion has got nothing to do
with the quality of my merchandise.

352
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,719
If you'd called your rose a "Lady Beldon",
I'd have said right and proper.

353
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,077
- But who's Mrs. Miniver?
- The nicest lady in the neighborhood...

354
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,437
...Mr. Huggins, that's who.
- Yeah, maybe, but a newcomer.

355
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,355
No, Mr. Ballard, you stick to
the railway and leave roses alone.

356
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,274
Why should I? Why should I?
They're my hobby, the roses are.

357
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,908
And the railway can go to...

358
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,432
- Doesn't she look lovely?
- And a sense of humor too.

359
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,353
I loved the way she
handled Vin this afternoon.

360
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,550
I think she's coming over.

361
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,790
- Hello.
- Good evening, Miss Beldon.

362
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,554
- Please, sit down.
- Sit down, won't you?

363
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,994
Thank you.

364
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,754
- Enjoying it?
- Yes, such a wonderful band.

365
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,831
- How about a cordial?
- No, thanks.

366
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,230
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

367
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,597
- I was rather looking for your son.
- I'm sorry, Vin's not here.

368
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,957
No, he's suffering from
an acute case of maturity.

369
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,591
Yes. But it'll pass. We give it
a week or two, at the outside.

370
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,309
I wanted to tell him I was
sorry about this afternoon.

371
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,879
I rather think he wanted to say the
same thing himself. It's a pity...

372
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,315
I beg your pardon. For you, Miss Beldon.

373
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,913
Thank you.

374
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,559
- May I?
- Of course.

375
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,356
- Secret?
- Well, I suppose it is.

376
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,876
- Do I scent romance?
- Well, it is intriguing.

377
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,314
Will you excuse me? Please don't get up.

378
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,189
- I'll see you later.
- Is it that big Navy lad from Dartmouth?

379
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,039
You'd be surprised.

380
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

381
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,075
- You got my note?
- As you see.

382
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,151
Yes, of course.

383
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,635
Miss Beldon, I don't want you to think
I'm going back on anything I said.

384
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,552
Of course not.

385
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,396
But I did express myself
a bit emphatically.

386
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,636
I hope you'll excuse me. My
mode of expression, I mean.

387
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,030
There's really nothing to excuse.

388
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,590
Everyone's entitled to
his mode of expression.

389
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,669
Still, I had no right to lose my temper.

390
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,152
- I'm usually quite detached.
- I was pretty snippy myself, wasn't I?

391
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,118
And quite in the wrong,
anyway. I'm sorry.

392
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,394
It's nice of you to say so.

393
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,593
Well...

394
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,719
I'd better be getting
back. I promised this tango.

395
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,917
Oh, you couldn't. Well,
I mean, just for a moment.

396
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,710
You see, I've got so much I want
to say, to explain about myself.

397
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,431
- Of course, you want to dance.
- You don't dance?

398
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,955
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

399
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,271
Matter of fact, I'm considered
a pretty good dancer.

400
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,839
But I've rather given
up that sort of thing.

401
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,393
Well...

402
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,516
I mean, frankly...

403
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,274
...is this a time for frivolity?

404
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,351
Is this a time to lose
one's sense of humor?

405
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,798
- Did you say give him a week or two?
- Maybe an hour or two will be enough.

406
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,355
And I used to see you go by...

407
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,035
...and you used to ride in a little
tub cart, then you had a pony.

408
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,749
- Oh, yes. He was a dear.
- He was very, very fat, and so were you.

409
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,275
- I was not fat.
- You were, very fat.

410
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,000
Why, you had legs like
overstuffed sausages.

411
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,391
You see, I've really known
you for years and years.

412
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,269
I used to think about you a lot.

413
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,473
Well, don't you believe me?

414
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,518
- Well, you know, you are a good talker.
- I wish I were.

415
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,798
- I'd like to tell you just how I feel.
- You've told me a lot for one day.

416
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,235
One day. Why, one day's ridiculous.

417
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,233
What's one day out of all the vast...?

418
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,591
Do you have any conception...?

419
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,668
Can't we arrange to
meet again sometime soon?

420
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,478
Tomorrow.

421
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,191
Tomorrow I'm leaving for Scotland.

422
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,154
- For long?
- Until the middle of September.

423
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,233
- We always go, every year.
- But that's months.

424
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,438
- May I write to you?
- Yes, Vin.

425
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,068
This has been a wonderful
evening, hasn't it?

426
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,719
Yes, Vin.

427
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,790
It's been a wonderful
evening, hasn't it?

428
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,997
- Have I said that before?
- It's been a wonderful evening.

429
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,197
- For you too?
- For me too, Vin.

430
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,079
Well, looks as though we've had
all that quarreling for nothing.

431
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,152
Don't look as if there'll
be a flower show after all.

432
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,673
What makes you say that?

433
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,674
Her ladyship's talking of postponing
the show on account of conditions.

434
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,832
Very right and proper.

435
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,195
They've marched into
Poland, haven't they?

436
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,715
That means war, if you ask me.

437
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,110
And if war comes...

438
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,875
...it's "Goodbye, roses".
- Don't talk silly.

439
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,157
You might as well say,
"Goodbye, England".

440
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,914
There will always be roses.

441
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,595
She's come back. She wasn't to
have returned for another week.

442
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,109
Dearly beloved brethren, the
scripture moveth us in sundry places...

443
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,955
...to acknowledge and confess
our manifold sins and wickedness.

444
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,910
And not dissemble nor cloak them before
almighty God, our heavenly father.

445
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,197
But confess them with a humble, lowly...

446
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,237
Will everyone please be seated.

447
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,875
It has just been announced over
the air by the prime minister...

448
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,271
...that our country is at war.

449
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,112
In the circumstances...

450
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,635
...I don't think you'll
wish me to continue...

451
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,952
...as you will probably, most of
you, have some other duty to perform.

452
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,392
I will say simply this:

453
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,957
That the prayer for peace
still lives in our hearts...

454
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,954
...coupled now with the
prayer for our beloved country.

455
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,679
We in this village...

456
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,796
...have not failed in the past.

457
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,790
Our forefathers, for 1000 years, have
fought for the freedom we now enjoy.

458
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,879
And that we must now defend again.

459
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,836
With God's help...

460
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,956
...and their example...

461
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,633
...we cannot...

462
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,836
...and shall not fail.

463
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,959
- Are we going to be bombed, Daddy?
- Toby, don't shout, darling.

464
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,634
- Are we going to be bombed?
- Come on.

465
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,516
- Carol.
- I'll be right along, Granny.

466
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,398
- Beg your pardon. Carol!
- Hello.

467
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,913
You came back early.

468
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,993
Oh, I'm so glad. How are you
fixed, in case of anything?

469
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,835
Quite all right, I think.
I must go, Vin. Goodbye.

470
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,558
Yes?

471
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,949
Ma'am, I'm so glad you've come.
Gladys is carrying on... Pardon me.

472
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,635
Carrying on something awful. I've
had her on me hands all morning.

473
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,314
- What's the matter?
- It's on account of Horace.

474
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,040
Called up and asked to
join his regiment tonight.

475
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,668
Yes, ma'am, and Gladys
in floods of tears.

476
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,114
And that stove...

477
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,114
...the man only come Friday to look
at it, and what he done, I don't know.

478
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,589
But she's not fit to
work. She's not, really.

479
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,398
Well, never mind, Ada.

480
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,596
I daresay we'll manage somehow.

481
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,034
Napoleon!

482
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,633
Toby, take him away.

483
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,679
- I suppose they broadcast the news.
- Yes, ma'am, what a dreadful thing.

484
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,673
And that laundry. Lost
another of me best aprons.

485
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,355
- But we've always got the navy.
- That's right, Ada.

486
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,075
Oh, come on, now. Cheer up, Gladys.

487
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,754
Horace won't be anywhere
near the frontline.

488
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,957
Oh, yes, he will. He's one
to push himself forward.

489
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,033
He says, "You let me get me hands on Hitler.
I'll give him sweatsticker".

490
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,474
Give him what?

491
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,996
Sweatsticker. You know, sir, the
sign they have on their flags.

492
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,390
Well, that's the proper spirit, Gladys.

493
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,552
He's got too much spirit.
He gives way to it.

494
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,759
I beg pardon, but would you tell Gladys
Horace has got to catch his train...

495
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,639
...and could he come in
a minute and say goodbye?

496
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,030
- Oh, of course he can.
- Come in, Horace.

497
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,156
Thank you, sir. Morning, everybody.

498
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,673
Good morning, Horace.

499
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,513
- Will you have a sherry?
- Don't mind if I do.

500
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,277
- And jolly good luck to you, Horace.
- Yes, indeed.

501
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,432
- Jolly good luck, Horace.
- Thanks, Master Toby.

502
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,797
To your very good health.
My best respects, ma'am.

503
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,191
The children are going to miss
you terribly. And poor Gladys.

504
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,352
Oh, she'll be all
right, won't you, Glad?

505
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,790
Here, here. That's
not the way to behave.

506
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,509
How do you expect me to behave
when you go off and get killed?

507
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,557
Well, cheer up. I ain't killed yet.

508
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,676
Here, have a drop of this.

509
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,593
- You don't mind, sir?
- Oh, certainly not.

510
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,277
There. That's better.

511
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,351
Have one for yourself now.

512
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,478
You'll want Gladys to see
you to the station, won't you?

513
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,358
Go get your hat.

514
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,999
Very nice drop of stuff, this. Last
I shall get for a bit, I expect.

515
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,311
Make a lot of difference to a
lot of people, this war will.

516
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,630
Yes, a lot of difference.

517
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,110
We may all meet on the frontline yet.

518
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,589
Not me, Horace. The RAF for me.

519
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,079
Oh, boy!

520
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,277
- I've always been keen on flying.
- That's all right too.

521
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,512
Well, I got to get to me
train. I'll say goodbye, ma'am.

522
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,752
Yes, of course, Horace.
Goodbye, and the best of luck.

523
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,194
Goodbye, Horace.

524
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,716
- Let us know how it's going.
- I will. You'll excuse the spelling.

525
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,553
I'm better with a bayonet
than with a pencil.

526
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,314
You can write it in blood.

527
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,352
Nice child you have.

528
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,317
- Keep your chin up.
- Thank you.

529
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,597
Hello! Well, she's
done you proud, Horace.

530
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,797
Not half, she ain't.
Full dress inspection kit.

531
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,997
- And very nice too, Gladys.
- Thank you, ma'am.

532
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,197
- Say goodbye to Napoleon.
- Goodbye, all. And cat.

533
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,954
- And many thanks, I'm sure.
- Goodbye, Horace.

534
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,837
Bye, Horace.

535
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,276
Mind if I get on with the blackout?

536
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,873
All right, dear.

537
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,600
Thought I'd run up to
the Beldon place later on.

538
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,349
Two women alone, you know, might
be a good idea to look things over.

539
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,909
Yes, I think you should, dear.

540
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,678
- One ought to be neighborly.
- Oh, yes, indeed one should.

541
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,308
- May I go with him, Mother?
- Lf he'll have you.

542
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,311
No!

543
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,793
Isn't he very young,
even for the air force?

544
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,513
Yes, he's young.

545
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,392
- May I see Miss Carol?
- Is she expecting you, sir?

546
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,516
No, but I think she would see me.

547
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,318
- Vin!
- Hello, Carol.

548
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,233
It's all right, Chandler.
It's nice of you to come.

549
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,551
Well, I wanted to find out
if everything's all right.

550
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,234
Do come in. Everything's fine.

551
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,436
After a terrific row with Mr. Foley...

552
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,990
...my grandmother's agreed to
obey the blackout regulations.

553
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,436
- I was worried about you.
- That's sweet of you, Vin.

554
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,032
It was sweet to write me
letters while I was in Scotland.

555
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,475
- So you did get them.
- Yes, of course.

556
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,029
I wondered if you did
when you didn't answer.

557
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,831
Vin, I didn't know how to answer.

558
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,991
You're such a crazy boy...

559
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,469
...and I didn't think
the craze would last.

560
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,838
- Craze?
- Well, it is rather sudden, isn't it?

561
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,514
This is only the third time we've met.

562
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,477
Does that matter?

563
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,791
No, but I'd like to be sure.

564
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,392
I don't really know you very well, do I?

565
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,235
We could do something about that.
We could see a lot of each other.

566
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,630
Every day while I'm around.

567
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,271
- Would that be all right?
- Why, yes. Why not?

568
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,036
- Gosh, I'm glad to see you again.
- I'm glad too, Vin.

569
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,556
I say, is it an awful nerve?

570
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,793
Well, I mean, we have a sort
of agreement, haven't we?

571
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,238
- Would it be going too far?
- It's all right, Vin.

572
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,989
I heard voices. May I ask
whom you're entertaining?

573
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,310
This is Vincent Miniver. My grandmother.

574
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,119
- How do you do, Lady Beldon?
- Miniver?

575
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,478
Miniver. I know that name.

576
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,359
A rose with that name has
been entered in the show.

577
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,590
The Miniver rose.

578
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,079
That's something new.

579
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,391
The Marshall Neil, the
flower called Drushke...

580
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,633
...the Duchess of Argyle
and now the Mrs. Miniver.

581
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,074
Please, Granny.

582
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,390
A tramp rose grown in a station yard.

583
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,471
It's nothing to do with Vin.

584
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,154
Then what's he doing
here, if one may ask?

585
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,630
- I came to offer my services.
- I see.

586
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,756
You're in league with wretched Foley.

587
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,229
- Oh, no, Lady Beldon.
- Oh, Granny.

588
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,958
Never heard such rot.

589
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,476
We can take care of ourselves.
We have for the last 800 years.

590
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,790
- But...
- We don't take orders, we give them.

591
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,996
Worst thing about this
war is the chance...

592
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,390
...it gives little persons
to become important.

593
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,232
Air raids, indeed.

594
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,190
Those wretched Germans.
They wouldn't dare...

595
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,196
- What should we do?
- Do? Nothing.

596
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,750
- It's Foley giving a false alarm.
- You can't take that attitude.

597
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,512
I beg your pardon, young man!

598
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,591
You must take precautions.

599
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,797
Ring for the butler and gather
the servants in the cellar.

600
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,518
Then go down there yourself.

601
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,478
- I must call my parents. The telephone?
- In the hall.

602
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,073
Upon my word!

603
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,432
- Sirens, milady.
- I'm not deaf.

604
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,673
- Get all the servants quickly to the cellar.
- You too, Granny. He said so.

605
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,756
The cellar!

606
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,510
Hello? That you, Dad?

607
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,432
All right with you?

608
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,636
Yes, everything under control.

609
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,155
Right. I'll expect you
when I see you, then.

610
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,550
- Who is it?
- Air raid warden.

611
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,879
Hello, Foley. What's up?

612
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,077
- You're showing a light.
- We are?

613
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,993
Bright horizontal beam
plainly visible from the air.

614
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,152
- Every window in the house is...
- Ground level.

615
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,991
Oh, gosh. This way, Foley.

616
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,793
Thank you.

617
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,832
- Good evening, Mrs. Miniver.
- Good evening, Mr. Foley.

618
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,359
Yes.

619
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,428
- How about this blanket, Mr. Foley?
- I think I can use it, all right.

620
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,834
There. That fixes that.

621
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,590
It's those tiny cracks
that do the damage.

622
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,591
One man lighting a cigarette...

623
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,320
...stands out like a
beacon from 5000 feet up.

624
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,632
One little crack of light might lead
the whole German air force straight here.

625
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,439
- Well, it was lucky it was just you.
- Yes, indeed.

626
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,989
Strictly speaking,
you're liable to a fine...

627
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,436
...but as senior warden,
you'll hear no more about it.

628
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,036
- That's awfully nice.
- You got a nice place here for storage.

629
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,475
Hear the Minister of
Food the other day...

630
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,551
...recommended stocking up a bit?

631
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,871
You want to put in some tin
foods in case of emergency.

632
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,350
Sugar, now, sure to go out.

633
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,956
I've got some wonderful demerara.
Will 50 pounds be enough?

634
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,159
- Well, really, I...
- Make it 20 pounds, best demerara.

635
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,038
- Bismarck herring?
- I hate them.

636
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,749
Kipper snacks? Salmon? Sardines?
I've got lovely Italian sardines.

637
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,038
Might not be able to get them later.
You never know what Mussolini will do.

638
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,077
There you are. All clear.

639
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,356
They didn't get further than the coast.

640
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,672
- Is the war over, Mommy?
- No, darling.

641
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,354
- This is just the first day.
- Oh, good.

642
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,078
Oh, come on.

643
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,238
<i>Attention, England.</i>

644
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,392
<i>This is your English
friend in Germany again.</i>

645
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,949
<i>Now, listen carefully
while there's yet time.</i>

646
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,032
<i>Time to avoid further useless bloodshed.</i>

647
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,549
<i>It's now eight months since
your government declared war...</i>

648
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,191
<i>...eight months of progressive disaster
for the enemies of the German Reich.</i>

649
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,592
<i>France has been defeated as I told
you she would be, if you remember...</i>

650
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,954
<i>...and her invincible
armies completely crushed.</i>

651
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,432
<i>I need hardly tell you that
England comes next on the list.</i>

652
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,752
<i>Already the boasted British coolness
has given place to blind panic.</i>

653
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,152
<i>Already there have been serious
riots in your key industries...</i>

654
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,629
<i>...and they didn't
tell you that, did they?</i>

655
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,917
<i>Already the British lion
is howling with terror.</i>

656
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,311
- Turn it off, George.
- Had enough?

657
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,074
He's all wind and whitewash,
like a blinking rook.

658
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,595
- Can't we get some news?
- Not till 9.

659
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,070
You work at the airfield. You
see that German plane come down?

660
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,356
I heard it. I wonder where the pilot is.

661
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,876
With all that cover in them
woods, he could lay there for days.

662
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,110
But he's got to get food, don't forget.

663
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,999
Be funny if he walked
in here, wouldn't it?

664
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,675
- He'd never do that.
- I don't know so much.

665
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,628
They're clever. Some goes to Oxford
and learns to speak English...

666
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,155
...just as good as what you and me do.

667
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,639
Well, almost.

668
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,230
- Did you get that Fritz?
- Not yet. We will.

669
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,279
- Whiskey. What are you having?
- I'll have a beer, sir.

670
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,953
Pretty smart, these Jerries.

671
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,237
- This chap was an ace too.
- Got six of our fellows.

672
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,238
Cheerio!

673
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,234
- Vin!
- Hello, Dad.

674
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,675
- Where did you spring from?
- Belham Airfield.

675
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,638
- You're practically on the doorstep.
- Isn't it grand?

676
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,439
- I was buzzing home when I saw you.
- This is good news.

677
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,115
You don't know the half of it.
See that? Pilot Officer Miniver.

678
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,518
- So soon? I thought...
- Things are moving pretty fast.

679
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,079
They cut short the course.

680
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,119
<i>I got 85% on the test and a
week's leave on the strength of it.</i>

681
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,277
Great stuff. Congratulations.
That calls for a drink.

682
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,590
- What'll you have?
- I don't think I will.

683
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,479
I phoned Mother I was
coming. I called Carol too.

684
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,200
- I'll bet you did.
- I'll run up there later on.

685
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,999
- How much do I owe you, George?
- Five and sixpence.

686
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,152
- There you are. Keep the change.
- Thank you very much.

687
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,992
Bye, George.

688
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,358
Where is everybody? Kay!

689
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,916
- Well, what is this?
- Vin!

690
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,877
Mother. Carol.

691
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,595
Oh, Vin. Vin, darling.

692
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,238
Carol, both of you, it's wonderful.

693
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,194
I didn't want to miss
a minute. How are you?

694
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,351
- Fine. Don't I look it?
- He's brown.

695
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,999
Open-air life, Mother.

696
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,832
It's good to see you all again.

697
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,673
I sort of don't know which way to turn!

698
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,792
- Seen these? - Makes a
good-looking pilot, doesn't he?

699
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,714
- Vin, already?
- Two months before my regular time.

700
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,634
And what a bit of luck being
transferred to an airfield so near.

701
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,633
A fellow I knew had his
people living round about.

702
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,271
When he flew over, he'd cut his engine
so they'd know who it was. Like this:

703
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,954
Well, I suppose now you're
ready for real flying.

704
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,509
Not only for real flying but real...

705
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,275
- Well, whatever they send me into.
- Fighting.

706
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,836
- Where are the kids?
- Upstairs.

707
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,833
- You wouldn't let them dine with us?
- I might.

708
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,230
- I'll run up and tell them.
- No. I'm going.

709
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,594
- Clem, coming?
- Yeah. I've got to change.

710
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,233
- Hello.
- Hello.

711
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,157
- Have you heard we're losing Gladys?
- Is Horace on leave?

712
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,639
Oh, no, sir.

713
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,439
Gladys joined the WAAFs.
She's off to Aldershot.

714
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,717
- What's a WAAF?
- Women's Auxiliary Air Force.

715
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,190
It's just a coincidence that Horace
is stationed at Aldershot too.

716
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,750
Oh, sir! You are a marvel.

717
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,838
- Mother?
- Yes, darling.

718
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,709
Is Vin going to marry Carol?

719
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,634
Now, Toby, just finish
your dumpling, darling.

720
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,360
I only said, "Is Vin
going to marry Carol?"

721
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,035
Isn't it nice having Vin at home
and staying down here for dinner?

722
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,510
Yes. Are you going to marry Carol, Vin?

723
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,674
Well, since you bring it up, Toby,
I haven't had the nerve to ask her.

724
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,149
Why not? You're brave, aren't you?

725
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,639
Don't be so silly, Toby.

726
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,155
Gentlemen don't propose
when they're eating.

727
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,790
- Why not?
- Well, it's not romantic.

728
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,914
Of course it isn't.

729
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,834
- Toby.
- What?

730
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,639
Why don't you ask me if
I'm going to marry Vin?

731
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,711
Are you?

732
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,995
- Lf he asks me.
- He's afraid.

733
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,035
Why, say, I'm not
going to stand for that.

734
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,988
Carol, I meant to wait for Judy's
romantic moments and all that...

735
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,628
...but will you marry me, Carol? Soon?

736
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,872
Oh, egads. This is the
darnedest proposal I've...

737
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,078
Is it yes, Carol?

738
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,710
It's yes, Vin.

739
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,918
Oh, my dear, I'm so happy.

740
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,032
- May I...?
- Go ahead, Dad.

741
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,116
It's the telephone, ma'am. He wants to
speak to Pilot Officer Vincent Miniver.

742
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,158
Hello. Yes. Yes, speaking.

743
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,071
Why, of course, sir.

744
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,513
Oh, I see.

745
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,192
About half an hour.

746
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,039
Yes, sir.

747
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,192
Immediately, sir.

748
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,033
Goodbye.

749
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,349
That was the airfield. I have to report.

750
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,398
- It's a blow, isn't it?
- Oh, but why?

751
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,597
Some job or other. You don't
ask why in the air force.

752
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,433
- I'm sorry, Mother.
- I can't believe it, Vin.

753
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,353
- They promised you a week.
- You know how things are.

754
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,114
Good job I hadn't unpacked.
I'll go get my bag.

755
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,953
I promised to be at the
airport in half an hour.

756
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,554
I'll get the car and
drive you over, Vin.

757
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,797
Well, it's a disappointment.
No use pretending it isn't.

758
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,871
But now that we've got him so near...

759
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,429
Does that mean that
he's going into action?

760
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,909
Not necessarily, Carol.

761
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,913
Well, I better get the car.

762
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,150
It certainly hasn't
been much of a leave.

763
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,276
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye, darling.

764
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,359
- Do take care of yourself.
- Oh, I will.

765
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,551
Goodbye, you.

766
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,796
Be good. Remember, you're engaged.

767
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,918
Better not tell the old
lady. Not until I get back.

768
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,358
Then we'll go hand in hand and beard
the old lion in her own rose garden.

769
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,713
Goodbye, Judy.

770
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,675
- Get me some souvenirs.
- What do you want?

771
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,751
Messerschmitt.

772
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,712
- Goodbye, Toby.
- Bye, Vin.

773
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,992
- Make me a dive bomber.
- All right.

774
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,954
- Bye.
- So long.

775
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,873
- Shoot down some Jerries and Fritzes.
- I will.

776
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,828
<i>Goodbye, and don't worry about
me. 85% on the test, you know.</i>

777
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,310
What a beautiful night.

778
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,517
Clear as day.

779
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,195
- Happy about the engagement, Clem?
- Oh, very.

780
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,148
- Sweet child, young Carol.
- Isn't she?

781
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,875
Wonder how the old
lady's going to take it.

782
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,598
She'll be proud.

783
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,036
- You couldn't be prejudiced, could you?
- Certainly not.

784
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,193
- Vin's a very unusual boy.
- Yes.

785
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,032
Listen, Clem.

786
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,311
Engine trouble.

787
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,677
No, it's Vin.

788
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,193
Don't you remember what
he told us about signaling?

789
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,828
About the boy who used
to signal to his mother?

790
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,151
- That was Vin.
- By Job, I believe you're right.

791
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,752
Good old Vin.

792
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,556
Good luck, Vin.

793
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,675
- Hello?
- Clem!

794
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,953
Yes?

795
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,318
Who?

796
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,509
- Oh, emergency. I see.
- What is it, Clem?

797
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,477
- It's all right, dear.
- Is it Vin?

798
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,551
Oh, no. It's only the river patrol.

799
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,155
All right, old man,
I'll come right over.

800
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,916
- You're not going out on the river?
- I've got to. I'm on patrol.

801
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,073
- I wonder what's up. 2:30.
- What on earth can they want?

802
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,514
I can't imagine.

803
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,434
You've been out after that German
flyer all day, and I'll not let you go.

804
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,397
Now I am confused.

805
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,516
Are those orders?

806
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,069
Where are you off to?

807
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,959
Sandwiches and a Thermos.

808
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,078
If you're going on
duty, you'll need them.

809
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,759
- Thank you.
- Hello, Miniver.

810
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,194
Hello, Halliday.

811
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,191
- Nobby, what's on?
- I don't know.

812
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,590
He's your crew. How
much petrol have you got?

813
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,548
- About half full. Why? What's up?
- Fill her up, Dixon.

814
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,558
Hi, Mr. Miniver.

815
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,039
- What's up?
- Wish I knew.

816
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,474
- What do you think?
- Don't know.

817
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,039
- Do you know?
- All I know is...

818
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,760
...I've been dragged out
of bed to open up the bar.

819
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,070
Awfully glad you were.

820
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,038
A couple of points to starboard there.

821
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,638
Scots, wae hae wi' Wallace bled.

822
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,910
- Hello, chaps.
- Why the glad rags?

823
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,516
Well, I was in London at the Savoy
and I got old Halliday's call...

824
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,513
...and I come straight down.
- Any idea what we're up to?

825
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:37,789
Who cares? "Theirs is not to reason why.
Theirs is but to do or die".

826
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,916
Gallant 600.

827
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,469
- Give me a drink.
- Miniver, what you make of it?

828
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,519
I'll do anything for our country, but
digging us out at 2 in the morning...

829
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,238
That carries the war too far.

830
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,032
- Where are we going?
- Orders are to collect all petrol boats...

831
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,668
...of 30 feet and over
I can lay my hands on...

832
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,638
...shove crews in, fill them
and send them to Ramsgate.

833
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,518
- Ramsgate?
- Why Ramsgate?

834
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,114
I don't know. Your
guess is as good as mine.

835
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,795
- The sooner we get off the better.
- Hooray for Ramsgate!

836
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,349
- Sign that for me, will you, Joe?
- Sure thing.

837
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,591
- Come on, Mac.
- Sign that for me.

838
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,318
What on earth?

839
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,068
There must be close to 1000.

840
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,550
Look. Look, sir.

841
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,115
<i>Attention, please.</i>

842
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,909
<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

843
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,668
<i>Attention, please.</i>

844
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,160
<i>Switch off your engines.</i>

845
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,668
<i>As you know, the British
Expeditionary Force...</i>

846
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,229
<i>...is trapped between
the enemy and the sea.</i>

847
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,358
<i>Four hundred thousand men
are crowded on the beaches...</i>

848
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,954
<i>...under bombardment
from artillery and planes.</i>

849
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,635
<i>Their only chance to escape
annihilation rests with you.</i>

850
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,951
<i>Your destination is Dunkirk.</i>

851
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,596
<i>It's my duty to tell you that
the effort is not without risk.</i>

852
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,399
<i>You are asked to cross
40 miles of open sea...</i>

853
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,870
<i>...many of you in small boats
that are far from seaworthy.</i>

854
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,396
<i>Shore guns and enemy aircraft are
going to make it tough for you.</i>

855
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,394
<i>Any of you who wish to
withdraw may do so now.</i>

856
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,032
<i>Very good.</i>

857
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,838
<i>We'll put to sea at once.</i>

858
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,309
<i>Smaller boats without
compasses will follow...</i>

859
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,233
<i>...in the wake of larger
ships at the head of the line.</i>

860
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,311
<i>Every moment counts.</i>

861
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,914
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

862
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,473
- All right with you?
- Aye, sir.

863
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,993
Turn her over.

864
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,158
Good morning, ma'am.

865
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,959
- Good morning, Mr. Ballard.
- You're up early.

866
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,317
Yes. I haven't been sleeping very well.

867
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,034
Listen.

868
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,031
Guns.

869
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,355
Funny how the sound
carries with this east wind.

870
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,279
Mr. Miniver's not back
from Dunkirk, I suppose?

871
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,273
No, he's not back. Neither is my son.

872
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,232
They've been gone five days now.

873
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,438
- Oh, they'll be back, ma'am. You'll see.
- Yes.

874
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,353
- I'll be very glad to see.
- You will.

875
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,798
Them that goes down to the sea in ships
and has business in the great waters...

876
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,317
...these men see the works of the
Lord and his wonders in the great deep.

877
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,790
<i>You can't beat the Bible, can you,
when it comes to deep feelings?</i>

878
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,428
- No.
- And no one that's thrown that over...

879
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,151
...for a set of Goebbels and
Görings is going to win this war.

880
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,880
- That's my comfort, ma'am.
- Mine too, Mr. Ballard.

881
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,636
There's to be a flower show this
year, you know, up at Beldon Hall.

882
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,712
It takes more than a war
to stop her old ladyship.

883
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,751
Oh, I am so sorry. What were you saying?

884
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:57,795
I was telling you about my rose, ma'am.
I've entered it for the show and I...

885
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,599
Well, I should know better
than to be bothering you.

886
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,990
Oh, but you're not. I'm so glad.

887
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,355
It's a beautiful rose.
It deserves a prize.

888
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,916
Thank you, ma'am. Well...

889
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,511
- I'll be getting along.
- Good day, Mr. Ballard.

890
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,637
Move or make noise, I shoot.

891
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,832
Alone?

892
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,996
My children are upstairs, and the maid.

893
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,116
All asleep.

894
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,952
Food. Drink.

895
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,758
All right.

896
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,239
- Food, quick.
- I'm getting it.

897
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,073
Stop pointing that gun at
me! You're frightening me!

898
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,119
Milk. Milk.

899
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,078
Hurry.

900
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,233
Give me.

901
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,197
- You got meat?
- Yes, I think so.

902
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,559
- Hurry.
- I am hurrying.

903
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,278
Go back.

904
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,751
It's the milkman.

905
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,076
Coat. Give me coat.

906
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,638
Wait.

907
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,635
I'll get you the coat.

908
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,796
Keep door open.

909
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,398
Go.

910
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,437
The police. Urgent, please.

911
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,394
Police? This is Mrs. Miniver.

912
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,152
Miniver.

913
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,718
Starlings. I've got that German
flyer, the one who escaped.

914
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,632
In the kitchen.

915
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,674
Yes, I'm all right. Will
you come to the back door?

916
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,798
He's wounded. Bring a doctor.

917
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,593
Thank you.

918
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,274
I took your gun.

919
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,350
- You call police?
- Yes. It's much better.

920
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,998
Let me help you.

921
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,632
There, now. It's much better
this way. Really, it is.

922
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,234
You'll be wonderfully
looked after in a hospital.

923
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,709
You'll be safe there.

924
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,633
The war won't last forever.

925
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,038
No.

926
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,635
Soon we finish it.

927
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,278
I'm finish...

928
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,670
...but others come...

929
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,674
...like me.

930
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,479
Thousands, many thousands.

931
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,517
Better.

932
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,031
All of this...

933
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,231
...you will see.

934
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,993
You will see.

935
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,035
We will come. We will
bomb your cities...

936
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,112
...like Barcelona...

937
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,793
...Warsaw...

938
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,111
...Narvik, Rotterdam.

939
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,953
Rotterdam we destroy in two hours.

940
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,797
- And thousands killed. Innocent people.
- Not innocent!

941
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,190
- They were against us!
- Women and children!

942
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,273
Thirty thousand in two hours.

943
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,878
And we will do the same thing here!

944
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,270
It's his arm, doctor.

945
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,399
- All right, sir.
- Come along, young fellow.

946
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,911
Thank you, ma'am. Move along now.

947
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,158
- You all right, Mrs. Miniver?
- Yes, thank you, doctor.

948
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,992
Mommy?

949
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,350
Who was that, Mommy?

950
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,951
Who was here, Mommy? Who was here?

951
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,112
Clem! It's Daddy, darling! It's Daddy!

952
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,236
Run and tell Judy.

953
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,870
Judy! Judy!

954
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,919
Clem, darling! Darling,
are you all right?

955
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,071
Hello, darling.

956
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,989
- Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
- Daddy! Daddy!

957
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,878
- Hello, darling.
- Daddy! Daddy!

958
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,600
- How are you?
- You're awful dirty.

959
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,197
- And I'm awful tired. Gosh, I'm tired.
- Come. You're going straight to bed.

960
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,399
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Just the boat.

961
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,511
Come on, children.

962
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,796
Go on, Toby.

963
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,110
Any word of Vin?

964
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,989
No, but he'll be back
soon. I'm sure of it.

965
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:18,391
Darling, it's so lovely to
have you home. Come on, Toby.

966
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,590
I want to sleep for a week.

967
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,432
There, darling.

968
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,830
Oh, that's good.

969
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,874
Can I get you some breakfast, darling?

970
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,398
It's Vin, Clem! It's Vin!

971
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,357
He's back.

972
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:54,557
- Did I hear you offer me some breakfast?
- Ten hours ago.

973
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,712
- Ten hours?
- But Vin ate it.

974
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,839
- Vin, home?
- Home.

975
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,274
Both of you.

976
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,478
Where is he now?

977
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:13,155
He went up to Beldon Hall to
break the news of the engagement.

978
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,470
I don't envy him that trip.

979
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,916
Serves him right, though, for
eating my breakfast. Anything left?

980
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,675
- What do you want?
- Well, I should...

981
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,035
- What have you got?
- I'll find out.

982
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,316
Ada!

983
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:33,269
I didn't know when you'd wake up, so
I couldn't order anything for dinner.

984
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,479
Breakfast. No matter what time it
is when I wake up, it's breakfast.

985
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,272
Come in.

986
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,757
- Hello, Ada.
- Well, I am glad to see you, sir!

987
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:46,117
After what it said in the papers,
I was quite worried about you.

988
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,714
- I was.
- That's nice of you, but I'm all right.

989
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,599
All I need now is a good
large plate of ham and eggs.

990
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,273
All right, sir.

991
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,398
- Then it is in the papers?
- About Dunkirk?

992
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,676
- Yes.
- Yes, dear.

993
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:02,232
Thank heavens. I shan't
have to tell you about it.

994
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,197
Clem, I'm so proud of you.

995
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,555
Are you, darling? Well, that's nice.

996
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,439
And come to think of it,
I'm a bit proud of myself.

997
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,195
What you might call a
real bit of navigation.

998
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,353
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

999
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,038
Oh, darling, I'm almost sorry for you,
having a nice, quiet, peaceful time...

1000
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,829
...when things were happening. But
that's what men are for, isn't it?

1001
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,309
To do things while women
look after the house.

1002
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,040
Yes, dear. Come in.

1003
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,831
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I just
remembered we ain't got any ham.

1004
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,673
- What?
- You gave it all to that German pilot.

1005
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,193
Oh, well, never mind.

1006
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,272
We've got some bacon. Mr.
Miniver likes that just as well.

1007
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,159
- All right, ma'am.
- What's that about a German pilot?

1008
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,959
- Nothing at all.
- What do you mean, "nothing at all"?

1009
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,999
Well, I just had a German pilot
in for ham and eggs this morning.

1010
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,232
- Wait! What's going on here?
- Now, Clem, don't get excited.

1011
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,631
- I'm going to draw your bath.
- I've had a bath. I'm not excited!

1012
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,552
- A cigarette?
- No, I don't want one.

1013
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,950
Was it the fellow we were looking for?

1014
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,872
- Yes.
- But what did you do?

1015
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,759
Woman, you're driving me
crazy. Didn't he have a gun?

1016
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,195
Well, yeah, he had a gun.

1017
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,158
Well?

1018
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,436
I took it from him
and called the police.

1019
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,718
Oh, you just took it to the
police... Just like that.

1020
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,394
And then I suppose you gave him tea.

1021
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,432
Milk.

1022
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,753
- Milk.
- Clem!

1023
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,752
- Come in.
- What is it, Ada?

1024
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,196
It's the old lady, ma'am. And
me with the eggs on the stove.

1025
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,749
- It's Lady Beldon.
- Beldon, here?

1026
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,480
No, ma'am. Downstairs.

1027
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,870
All right. Tell her
I'll be down in a minute.

1028
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,110
Very well, ma'am.

1029
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,152
Lady Beldon.

1030
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,598
If I hadn't known you'd taken that pilot
single-handed, I'd say you were scared.

1031
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:10,469
I am scared, just as I was when I
took that German pilot single-handed.

1032
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:14,952
- Know why she's come in such haste?
- To object to the marriage, I suppose.

1033
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,872
It's really insufferable snobbery.

1034
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,429
A boy like Vin, she ought
to be proud and happy.

1035
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,273
- And honored.
- I wish I had a better dress on.

1036
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,112
Oh, well.

1037
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:28,719
Clement Miniver, don't you dare smile.

1038
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,991
Why, Lady Beldon, this is nice.

1039
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,272
Won't you sit down here?

1040
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,117
I think I can guess why you came.

1041
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,113
- Vin's told you his news, hasn't he?
- Yes, Mrs. Miniver.

1042
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,273
- I do hope you're as pleased as we are.
- I'm afraid not. Why, they're infants.

1043
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,238
- Carol's 18 and that boy's not 20.
- Yes, they are young.

1044
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,995
I think I should tell you frankly:
I hope to persuade Carol to wait.

1045
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,913
- You think she may change her mind?
- Frankly, yes.

1046
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,988
- Perhaps make a better match.
- There's always that possibility.

1047
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,435
Of course, it may be
just maternal vanity...

1048
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,036
...but I don't think Carol
will find anyone nicer than Vin.

1049
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,556
- I don't believe she'll change her mind.
- It's a matter of opinion.

1050
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,757
- Her age is a matter of fact.
- Isn't that Beldon tradition...

1051
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,194
...to marry young?

1052
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,920
- I don't know what you mean.
- My daughter Judy...

1053
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,675
You've not met Judy. She had to
write a composition on the Crusades.

1054
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,229
She brought a small book
home from the library...

1055
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,472
<i>...called A Friend of King Richard the Lion
- Hearted.</i>

1056
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,235
- It was a life of an ancestor of yours.
- Really, I fail to see...

1057
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,551
It was a fascinating book. I got
quite interested in it myself.

1058
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,029
It was full of stories
of the Beldon family.

1059
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,476
I trust you satisfied yourself
we were worthy of the alliance.

1060
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,757
Well, there were one or two
things that rather surprised me.

1061
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,798
Did you know that the 12th
Lord Beldon was hanged?

1062
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,234
He was beheaded.

1063
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,550
Such things happen in the best families.

1064
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:10,474
- Usually in the best families.
- In fact, what interested me most...

1065
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,235
...was the extreme youth of the
Beldon brides. This Gilbert Beldon...

1066
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,632
...who went on the Crusades, married an
Isabelle Du Something-or-other, age 12.

1067
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,191
I did not come here to chatter pedigrees.
I'm old-fashioned. I believe in breeding.

1068
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,557
- That's neither here nor there.
- Your point is, they're too young.

1069
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,790
I've said so, haven't I?

1070
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,112
We're at war, Lady
Beldon. And Vin's a flyer.

1071
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:35,238
It's no excuse for rushing
into an ill-considered marriage.

1072
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,279
But in war, time is so
precious to the young people.

1073
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,716
- How old were you when you married?
- I?

1074
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,075
It's no use telling fibs...

1075
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:48,392
...because I looked you up.
- Oh, well, if you've looked me up...

1076
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,996
...I suppose you know that I was 16.

1077
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,392
- Sixteen. And did your parents approve?
- That's beside the point.

1078
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,516
Oh, forgive me. Is it?

1079
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,513
You married very young,
without your parents' consent...

1080
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,671
...and yet when Carol...

1081
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:08,199
- Oh, but perhaps you regretted it.
- I did nothing of the kind.

1082
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,715
- Then why...?
- My marriage lasted a few weeks.

1083
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,475
My husband was in the army.
He was killed in action.

1084
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,359
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Forgive me. I didn't know.

1085
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,114
I never regretted it.
Not for one moment.

1086
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,919
We married because we
knew that might happen.

1087
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:26,755
But I don't want Carol
to suffer as I suffered.

1088
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,157
Don't you want her to be happy,
even for a little while...

1089
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,231
...the way you were?

1090
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,353
I was afraid you'd say that.

1091
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,353
Not that it matters what you
say. Or what I say, either.

1092
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,192
You know that, don't you?

1093
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,794
You mean, Carol will go her own way?

1094
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,190
She's my granddaughter.

1095
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,190
Well, then why?

1096
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,396
Goodness knows.

1097
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,710
I was beaten before I started.

1098
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,952
You don't mind terribly, do you?

1099
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,588
He is a nice boy.

1100
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,919
Yes.

1101
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,877
I see now where he gets it.

1102
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,314
You're pretty too.

1103
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,313
No wonder that wretched Ballard
named his rose after you.

1104
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,472
Not that he's got a chance
of getting the cup from me.

1105
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:13,474
Well, so long as we're
going to be relatives...

1106
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,473
...the least you can do
is to offer me some tea.

1107
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,911
- Well?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1108
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,996
"So Alice sat on with closed eyes...

1109
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,720
...and half believed
herself again in Wonderland.

1110
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,950
With the grass rustling in the wind...

1111
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,873
...and the pool rippling to
the waving of the reeds...

1112
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:42,079
...the tinkling sheep bells,
the voice of the shepherd boy...

1113
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,038
...and the lowing of the
cattle in the distance.

1114
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:49,478
She pictured to herself how she would
keep through all her riper years...

1115
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:53,474
...the simple and loving
heart of her childhood...

1116
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,757
...and how she would gather
about her other little children...

1117
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:01,436
...and make their eyes bright and
eager with many a strange tale.

1118
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,910
Perhaps even with a dream
of Wonderland".

1119
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,757
- They're asleep.
- Good.

1120
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,749
- What time is it, darling?
- Ten to 10.

1121
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,633
Going to have your coffee now?

1122
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,918
No. I think I'll have
a little smoke first.

1123
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,238
Anything you want from the house?

1124
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,958
No, I don't think so.

1125
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:35,430
I'm not going to risk my life
for your knitting needles again.

1126
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,795
No. I've got them with me.

1127
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,029
Fine barrage tonight, isn't it?

1128
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,236
It gets better each time.

1129
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,594
I can't hear any bombs, can you?

1130
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,352
No.

1131
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,478
I suppose they're saving
them for the aerodrome again.

1132
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,312
Yes.

1133
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,430
And the county hospital.

1134
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,118
Well.

1135
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,838
- My laundry come back?
- Tomorrow.

1136
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,478
Tomorrow.

1137
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,794
Oh, no, you don't.

1138
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,278
You ought to patent that, Clem.

1139
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,749
It saves us from suffocating.

1140
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,391
- See this new idea?
- No. What is it?

1141
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,155
The latest in gas detectors. If
there's any gas, the gauze turns green.

1142
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,754
Does it stop the gas from coming in?

1143
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,111
If you see this gauze change color...

1144
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,714
...grab this, shut it
with a bang like that, see?

1145
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,031
- Then what happens?
- Then we suffocate.

1146
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,748
- Biscuit?
- Thank you.

1147
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,036
Mrs. Miniver's best.

1148
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,191
- Ada wasn't much good at coffee.
- She was awful.

1149
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,272
Still, she was a good
cook, as good cooks go.

1150
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,876
And as good cooks go, she went.

1151
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:01,556
Still, Ada will be a tower of
strength in the tank corps canteen.

1152
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,478
Closer.

1153
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,713
I wonder what Toby would
do if he lost that cat.

1154
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,154
I daren't think.

1155
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,070
I suppose that's the
way to be really happy.

1156
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,959
Be with something that you
just can't live without.

1157
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,838
Or someone.

1158
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,512
Isn't that getting a little long?

1159
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,513
Vin says they like them
long in the air force.

1160
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:50,474
Isn't it nice they're getting
back for the flower show?

1161
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,914
Yes, isn't it?

1162
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,516
- Find out when their train arrives?
- 11:45, I think they said.

1163
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,352
Good.

1164
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,115
I am glad they went to Scotland for
the honeymoon. It's so beautiful.

1165
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,793
Yeah.

1166
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,598
That's a bomb.

1167
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,068
They are going for the aerodrome again.

1168
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,159
- Have you finished with this, darling?
- Yes.

1169
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,834
It's a lovely story.

1170
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,752
I wonder if Lewis Carroll ever
dreamed it would live forever.

1171
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:38,196
- You know, it's the first story I read.
- Mine too.

1172
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,873
Really?

1173
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,548
"How she would keep through
all her riper years...

1174
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,757
...the simple and loving
heart of her childhood...

1175
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,598
...and how she would gather
about her little children...

1176
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,912
...and make their eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale".

1177
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:10,471
"Perhaps even with the dream
of Wonderland of long ago.

1178
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,315
And how she would feel with
all her simple sorrows...

1179
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,075
...and find a pleasure
in all her simple joys...

1180
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:24,031
...remembering her own child life
and the happy summer days".

1181
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,759
The happy summer days.

1182
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:57,031
Napoleon's all right,
darling. He's gone under there.

1183
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,996
- Mommy?
- Yes, dear?

1184
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,311
They nearly killed us
this time, didn't they?

1185
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,438
It's all over, darling.
It's all over now.

1186
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,949
- Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad.
- Hello, darling.

1187
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,758
How have you been?

1188
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,153
We had a wonderful time.

1189
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,788
Good-looking bride you've got, boy.

1190
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,036
- Hello, Mother!
- Oh, my God.

1191
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,395
- Good to see you again.
- Wonderful.

1192
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,278
Carol, sweet.

1193
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,079
- Don't I get a kiss?
- Certainly do.

1194
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,629
- Did you enjoy yourselves?
- We had a lovely time.

1195
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,677
We fished and rowed and sailed.

1196
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,230
We had a lovely little cottage
and a Mrs. McLorry to cook for us.

1197
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,868
How she cooked, and how we ate.

1198
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,076
- Can I help you, Dad?
- No.

1199
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,430
- Hello, Mr. Ballard.
- How do you do?

1200
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:48,115
Morning, Ballard. I see you've
entered your rose in the flower show.

1201
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,510
- It's a good rose.
- I haven't seen it yet.

1202
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:53,478
I wager the best thing
about it is its name.

1203
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:57,394
The Mrs. Miniver. That's you, my dear.

1204
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:01,510
- You're coming to the flower show?
- All except Clem.

1205
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,636
I'm afraid I can't. I'm on patrol duty.

1206
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,597
You're missing a lot. Local talent.

1207
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,910
Old Snope is playing his flute solo.

1208
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,355
- I'll be there early.
- All right. Goodbye, dear.

1209
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,794
Careful.

1210
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:20,238
How's it going, George?

1211
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,755
Fine, Mr. Miniver. Just fine.

1212
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,194
Let's go, Vin.

1213
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:32,399
- Well, here we are.
- Welcome home, such as it is.

1214
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,271
It's quite a mess.

1215
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,714
It must've been dreadful.

1216
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,793
Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. We
just didn't have time to clear it all up.

1217
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,630
The dining room there
got the worst of it.

1218
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,950
But I always did want
to do that room over.

1219
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,111
- The upstairs is quite all right.
- Yeah.

1220
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:52,353
Darling, we'll have to get some blankets
up there and black that place out.

1221
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,157
- Toby, old boy.
- Vin!

1222
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,594
Vin.

1223
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,194
- Hello, Toby.
- Carol.

1224
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,154
That was wonderful.

1225
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,072
- Did you have a nice trip?
- It was fine.

1226
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,435
I've had the mumps.

1227
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,076
Oh, this was a lovely surprise.

1228
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:20,073
All right, children, let
Carol go now. Come on, Vin.

1229
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,878
I'll take you up to your room.

1230
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,916
It's your old room, of course,
Vin, but we made a few changes.

1231
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,594
Yeah, the Jerries made a few more.

1232
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:41,918
Thank your father too, darling.

1233
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,152
I'll do that right away and
bring up the rest of the luggage.

1234
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,960
Thanks for the lovely room.

1235
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,838
And thanks for Vin.

1236
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,479
He is nice, isn't he?

1237
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:56,676
I wonder if you know
how much I love him.

1238
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:00,150
I only have to look at you. And him.

1239
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,676
Have you seen the view here?

1240
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,195
It's really beautiful.

1241
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,918
Oh, it is.

1242
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:10,072
- You're happy?
- Of course.

1243
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:14,033
I've had a lifetime of happiness
in these last two weeks.

1244
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,077
But, Carol, that's only the beginning.

1245
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:19,471
Kay, I'm not afraid to face the truth.

1246
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,279
- Are you?
- No.

1247
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,715
- I love him, but I know...
- Carol.

1248
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,791
I know that I may lose him.

1249
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,679
He's young and he loves
life, but he may die.

1250
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,159
Let me say it.

1251
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,074
He may be killed any day, any hour.

1252
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,198
You must have faced that in your mind.

1253
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,828
Yes, I've faced it.

1254
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,514
Then you know that
every moment is precious.

1255
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:46,592
We mustn't waste time in fear.

1256
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:49,115
You won't hate me for
saying this, will you?

1257
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,918
No, Carol.

1258
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,232
I will be very happy.

1259
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,029
Every moment that I
have him. Every moment.

1260
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,278
If I must lose him, there'll
be time enough for tears.

1261
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:06,113
There'll be a lifetime for tears.

1262
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:08,113
That's right, isn't it?

1263
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,436
Well, that's the lot. All my wife's.

1264
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,354
Say, have you noticed her
crested dressing case? Swank, eh?

1265
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,432
- Have we time to unpack?
- Yes. We won't lunch till 1.

1266
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:26,275
I promised we'd be at the flower show
by 3. Can't miss the entertainment.

1267
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,556
The glee club has a new number.

1268
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:04,153
There will now be an
interlude by the Belham band.

1269
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,234
- Hello, Ballard. How are you?
- All right, thanks.

1270
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,868
- Good luck. The best of luck to you.
- Thank you.

1271
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,032
- I hope you get it, Ballard.
- Thanks.

1272
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:30,759
- Bickles.
- Yes, milady.

1273
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:35,516
Hurry that paper from the judges.
We want to get through with it.

1274
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,274
- The judges are still debating, milady.
- What?

1275
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:41,193
Whatever for? Ridiculous creatures.

1276
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,669
Go and tell them I want
that decision at once.

1277
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,671
Yes, milady.

1278
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,390
- Have you seen old Ballard's rose?
- No, I haven't.

1279
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,394
That's a lie.

1280
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,710
I looked it over the moment it arrived.

1281
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,552
Well?

1282
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,674
It's a good rose.

1283
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:02,071
- Is it better than yours?
- That, young man, the judges will decide.

1284
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,878
You should worry. You'll get the cup.

1285
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:07,430
- You insinuating the judges are corrupt?
- They're scared of you.

1286
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,431
Oh, rubbish. Scared.

1287
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,436
The decision on the rose award, milady.

1288
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,198
Well, Mr. Vincent Miniver,
take a look at that.

1289
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,510
Congratulations. I'm
not a bit surprised.

1290
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:39,673
Set yourself up to know more than
the judges, eh? Misguided young man.

1291
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,956
Can't think what you see in him, Carol.

1292
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:45,200
- This is really important to you, isn't it?
- Yes.

1293
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:49,797
It's stupid of me, but there it is. I've
won that cup for as long as I can remember.

1294
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,791
Mr. Ballard's terribly keen too.

1295
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,394
Well, he's had his chance. Hasn't he?

1296
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,910
You have such a way
of looking at people.

1297
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:05,072
What do you expect me to do?
Reverse the judges' decision?

1298
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,237
I wouldn't put it past you.

1299
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:12,110
- Lf you happened to disagree with it.
- But I don't!

1300
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,637
Will your ladyship make the awards now?

1301
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,631
Certainly.

1302
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,672
This rose award, it's
your unprejudiced decision?

1303
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,831
Why, certainly, milady.

1304
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,672
Of course, milady.

1305
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,319
Won't you sit down?

1306
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,152
Sit down.

1307
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,832
My friends of Belham, it
is once again my pleasure...

1308
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,391
...to present the annual awards for
the best flowers grown in our community.

1309
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,677
The first-prize chrysanthemums.

1310
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,310
First prize, Miss Alice Lovedean.

1311
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:16,558
Second prize, Miss Sarah Pillbury.

1312
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,075
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, milady.

1313
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,197
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I come to the final award.

1314
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:32,912
The Challenge Cup, given
for the best rose...

1315
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:45,118
The best rose grown in the
village during the past year.

1316
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:50,156
The first prize, the
Silver Cup, goes to...

1317
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:01,316
Goes to Mr. James Ballard,
our popular stationmaster.

1318
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:31,518
The second prize, the
Certificate of Merit...

1319
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,113
...goes to me.

1320
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,597
All right. All right.

1321
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,632
All right. All right.

1322
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:00,395
This is the first time a rose
other than the Beldon rose...

1323
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,994
...has won the cup
since the show's began.

1324
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,116
I won't say I'm not disappointed.

1325
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,555
We Beldons are not used to competitors.

1326
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:11,599
In the old days, we just
lopped off their heads.

1327
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,230
Can't do that nowadays, more's the pity.

1328
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,832
But if I had to lose...

1329
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,310
...there's no man I'd sooner
lose to than James Ballard...

1330
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,036
...because he's a man of spirit,
and I like a man of spirit.

1331
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:29,556
Where are you? Ballard!
Where's that man?

1332
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:36,558
Here he is, milady! Here he is!

1333
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,916
Oh, Mr. Ballard, I'm so happy for you.

1334
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,435
It's your rose, ma'am.

1335
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,958
- Excuse me, milady.
- Not now, Foley.

1336
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,475
- Well, take it.
- Thank you, milady.

1337
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:33,155
- Congratulations.
- Pardon the liberty.

1338
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:39,319
Milady, enemy planes over
the coast, hundreds of them.

1339
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:42,233
Like as not, they'll go
after the airfield again.

1340
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:51,677
Order. Order. Silence!

1341
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:54,834
I'm sorry to disturb the
harmony of this occasion...

1342
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,436
...but our enemies are no
respecters of flower shows.

1343
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:02,354
Foley here says there's a chance
of air raiders passing this way.

1344
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:06,479
In the circumstances, it might be
better if you would return to your homes.

1345
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:09,359
Those who prefer are welcome
to the use of my cellars.

1346
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,432
It'll be lively. My young
visitors will see to that.

1347
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,632
And you won't starve.
Foley's seen to that.

1348
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:20,510
I believe we have 300
tins of Italian sardines.

1349
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:39,514
- Granny, you'll be all right?
- Of course.

1350
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:42,990
- You're not leaving me alone.
- You were wonderful. They loved you.

1351
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:46,391
- Vin needs to get back to the airfield.
- Yes, of course.

1352
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:52,029
- Give them a blast for me, will you?
- I shall certainly try.

1353
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,958
Wait. I still like to
be kissed, you know.

1354
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:57,872
Of course.

1355
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:01,316
- I say, you were wonderful.
- Yes, I was wonderful.

1356
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:02,754
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1357
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:04,239
Goodbye, Carol.

1358
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,790
Jerries over London in hundreds.

1359
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:51,389
I'll have to run. Goodbye, darling.

1360
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:53,232
Goodbye, Mother.

1361
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:55,793
Vin.

1362
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,310
He'll be all right, Carol.

1363
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,839
We must get on, Carol. I'm anxious
to get back to the children.

1364
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:58,950
Do you think the Foley girl will
take the children into the shelter?

1365
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:01,509
Of course. Don't worry, Kay.

1366
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,988
They seem to be fighting
right over our heads.

1367
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:19,275
I want so much to get home.

1368
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:24,115
I hate to stop, but
I suppose I'd better.

1369
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,352
It could be Vin. It could!

1370
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,670
No, Carol, no. It's not possible.

1371
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,637
There hasn't been time.

1372
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,438
Oh, no.

1373
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:33,750
How horrible.

1374
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:48,431
Those were bullets.

1375
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:51,797
And I was sure they hit the
car. I really was frightened.

1376
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,234
Of all the...

1377
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,231
Oh, Carol.

1378
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,312
The village.

1379
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:59,033
Oh, how awful.

1380
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,350
Oh, we must get back
there. They need help.

1381
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:04,114
Carol. Carol, what is it?

1382
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,952
Carol.

1383
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:08,111
Carol, are you hurt?

1384
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:13,029
Oh, darling.

1385
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,554
Carol.

1386
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,270
God, I think I've been hit.

1387
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,031
Oh, no, darling.

1388
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:33,832
- Where?
- I don't know. It doesn't hurt.

1389
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,309
I just can't move.

1390
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:44,478
Don't be frightened, we're nearly home.
I'll get you in and get help. Now, lie still.

1391
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,437
Yes, Kay.

1392
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:54,472
Emergency.

1393
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,872
Emergency?

1394
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,156
Ambulance, at once.

1395
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:09,073
All out?

1396
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:10,719
But this is terribly urgent.

1397
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:14,752
So is this, an air raid
casualty that's terribly...

1398
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:18,469
Well, the moment you get one
in, the first possible moment...

1399
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,551
...send it to Starlings.

1400
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:23,598
No, Starlings.

1401
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:26,474
Yes, the last house in Norton Lane.

1402
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:29,709
Yes, and hurry, please. Hurry.

1403
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,836
They're coming as soon as they can.

1404
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,877
I'll get a coat, darling.

1405
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:52,029
They'll be here any moment now.

1406
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:55,597
- You won't tell Vin?
- Of course not, darling.

1407
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:58,071
Darling.

1408
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:05,233
You're going to be all
right, Carol. I know you are.

1409
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:07,955
Don't be frightened, sweet.

1410
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:11,949
I'm going to be all right.

1411
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:16,360
I don't feel any pain.

1412
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:21,277
What is it? Can I get you something?

1413
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:26,109
Glass of water.

1414
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:28,557
Of course, darling.

1415
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:31,111
I'll be right back.

1416
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,073
Carol.

1417
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,078
Carol.

1418
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,398
Carol!

1419
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,677
Oh, God.

1420
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,398
God.

1421
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,473
God.

1422
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:56,392
Vin, dear.

1423
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:04,874
It's all right, Mother. I know.

1424
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,392
Where is she?

1425
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:12,353
Vin, dear, won't you try
and get a little rest?

1426
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,238
Where is she?

1427
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,876
In your room.

1428
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:44,670
I will read to you from Psalm 91.

1429
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:52,514
"I will say of the Lord, He
is my refuge and my fortress.

1430
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:56,036
My God, in him will I trust.

1431
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:59,118
Surely, he shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler...

1432
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,635
...and from the noisome pestilence.

1433
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:05,072
Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night.

1434
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:07,834
Nor for the arrow that flieth by day.

1435
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,438
Nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness.

1436
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:14,592
Nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday.

1437
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,149
He shall cover thee with his feathers...

1438
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:21,437
...and under his wings shalt thou trust.

1439
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:26,476
His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler".

1440
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:38,949
We in this quiet corner of England...

1441
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:44,231
...have suffered the loss
of friends very dear to us.

1442
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:47,308
Some close to this church.

1443
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:53,197
George West, choirboy.

1444
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:58,994
James Ballard, stationmaster and bell
- ringer...

1445
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:02,709
...and the proud winner, only
an hour before his death...

1446
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:07,711
...of the Beldon Cup
for his beautiful Miniver rose.

1447
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:11,990
And our hearts go out in sympathy...

1448
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:15,516
...for the two families who share
the cruel loss of a young girl...

1449
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:19,593
...who was married at this altar
only two weeks ago.

1450
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:23,358
The homes of many of us
have been destroyed...

1451
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:26,876
...and the lives of young
and old have been taken.

1452
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:30,828
There's scarcely a household that
hasn't been struck to the heart.

1453
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:33,352
And why?

1454
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:36,997
Surely you must have asked
yourselves this question.

1455
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:39,913
Why, in all conscience...

1456
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:42,719
...should these be the ones to suffer?

1457
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:46,949
Children, old people...

1458
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:50,795
...a young girl at the height
of her loveliness.

1459
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,758
Why these? Are these our soldiers?

1460
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,478
Are these our fighters?

1461
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,233
Why should they be sacrificed?

1462
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:04,076
I shall tell you why.

1463
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,635
Because this is not only a
war of soldiers in uniform...

1464
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:11,597
...it is a war of the people.

1465
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:13,512
Of all the people.

1466
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:17,195
And it must be fought not
only on the battlefield...

1467
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:20,796
...but in the cities
and in the villages.

1468
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:23,758
In the factories and on the farms.

1469
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:27,071
In the home and in the heart...

1470
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:31,153
...of every man, woman and
child who loves freedom.

1471
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:35,514
Well, we have buried our dead...

1472
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:37,432
...but we shall not forget them.

1473
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:42,230
Instead, they will inspire us with
an unbreakable determination...

1474
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:45,358
...to free ourselves and
those who come after us...

1475
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:49,672
...from the tyranny and terror
that threaten to strike us down.

1476
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,755
This is the people's war.

1477
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:55,435
It is our war.

1478
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:57,875
We are the fighters.

1479
02:05:58,040 --> 02:05:59,314
Fight it, then.

1480
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:02,278
Fight it with all that is in us.

1481
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:05,113
And may God defend the right.

1482
