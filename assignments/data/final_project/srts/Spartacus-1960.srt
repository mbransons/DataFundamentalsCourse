Hold your

Let the roman
have his say!

24
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,078
Thrace
and the republic

25
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:40,381
Have known
their differences.

26
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:43,817
We've not always
been as brothers.

27
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:46,653
But let us put
aside such matters,

28
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,856
Uniting in just cause.

29

<i>You pushed
your way into our land,</i>

And now you stand
asking for our help.

31
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:57,464
Your hand extended?

32
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:02,903
I extend no hand.
I am here merely to inform.

Encroaching
from the black sea.

Far removed
from our villages.

37
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:13,447
True. But the getae

38
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:16,350
Take advantage
of the distraction.

39
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:19,620
Their barbarian
hordes amass to the north.

40
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,489
Barely half a week's
March from your villages.

41
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,191
How many?

42
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:25,626
Thousands.

Align yourselves
with rome!

Pledge your service
to the auxiliary

46
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:35,836
And join
us in our campaign!

47
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:37,337
To what end?

48
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:39,239
To what end?!

49
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:44,211
Victory.

50
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,847
And how
is it to be measured?

51
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:49,716
The getae have raided
our villages in the past.

52
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:53,487
Raped our women.
Killed our children.

53
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:55,622
Each time
have pushed them back.

54
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,257
Only to see them return.

55
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:59,059
He speaks
out of turn.

56
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:01,662
Yet the truth
falls from his mouth.

57
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,832
If we are
to align with rome,

58
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:06,733
The purpose
must be clear.

59
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:12,072
The getae dead.

60
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,373
All of them.

61
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:21,215
Dead. All of them.

62

[crowd roar their approval]

63
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,369
The council has decided?

64
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:46,173
We go to war.

65
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,475
I've asked the gods
to bless your sword.

66
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,515
Once the getae
are wiped from our lands,

67
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:56,550
There'll be no reason
to ever pick it up again.

68
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:00,954
And what would my husband
do without it in his hands?

69
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:05,692
Grow crops.
Raise goats.

70
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,496
Make children...

71
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:19,306
You'd fight no more?

72
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:22,676
Forever.
To be by your side.

73
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:34,154
How soon do you March?

74
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:35,255
First light.

75
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,863
Then come to bed.

76
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,932
If one night is
all we have left...

77
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:46,700
I should
make the most of it.

78
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:13,327
[birds chirping]

79

Be strong my wife.

80

I woke expecting
my wife beside me.

81
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:38,385
She rose
early to pray.

82
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:42,956
That her husband
would stay with her.

83
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,526
I thought
were in agreement.

84
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:47,928
We were.
Were?

85
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:53,367
The gods came to me
last night.

00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,102
In my sleep.

What did
they show you?

00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:59,439
My husband
on his knees,

89
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:02,643
Bowing before
a great red serpent.

90
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,546
The life draining
from his veins.

91
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:08,515
What meaning
did you take from it?

92
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,517
A warning.

93
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:12,719
If you go to war,

94
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:15,555
You are destined for
great and unfortunate things.

95
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:23,330
The getae worship
the mountain wolf.

96
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:24,931
They place
no faith in snakes.

97
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,536
It was just
a dream.

98

And if it isn't?

Blood and honor.

101
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:37,844
It speaks to the man.

102
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:44,184
Nothing will keep me
from returning to your arms.

103
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:47,821
Not the getae.
Not the romans.

104
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,656
Not the gods themselves.

105
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:55,729
The nights grow so cold.

106
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:58,131
What am I to do
without you in our bed?

107
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:03,537
Lift your dress.

108
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,323
Keep me close to
your thighs,

109
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:24,991
The thought
will warm us both.

110
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:47,247
Kill them all.

111

Which word might that be?

146

The one I gave
the romans.

And my body
and blood with it.

We gave our word.

In my village such
a thing still bears meaning.

Is that why you're here?
To defend your village?

00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:25,151
[laughs]

171
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:45,672
[giggles]

172
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:55,448
Ilithyia.

173
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,684
What if I'd been
an assassin?

174
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:58,785
I'd be a widow.

175
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,654
What's the respectful
period of mourning

176
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:03,056
Before I could remarry?

177
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,959
You overstep.

178
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:07,727
Women are forbidden
within the encampment.

179
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:08,828
I was discreet.

180
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:09,996
Not you?

181
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:13,166
Your man helped wisk
me through the sentries.

182
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:16,169
After I threatened
to run naked through the camp,

183
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:17,737
Screaming
he laid his hands

184
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:19,305
On the wife
of the legatus.

185
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:28,681
Does your father
know you're in thrace?

186
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:31,084
Please. He's too
busy colluding

187
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,820
With the other
corpses in the senate.

188
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:36,890
He thinks I'm still
lounging at the villa in capua.

189
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:38,525
Far too arid.

190
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,560
Hasn't rained
there since last forever.

191
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:43,796
You should have written.

192
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:46,633
You would have
told me not to come.

193
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,635
I'm in the middle
of a war.

194
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:49,969
I brought you a gift.

195
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,209
Something
to remind you of rome.

196
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,178
Sestii wine!

197
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,079
Let me fill up
your cup

198
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:03,449
While you tell
me about your little war.

199
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:06,352
Too brief a tale.

200
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,988
Mithridates and his army
of greek whores

201
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:12,659
Press the legion in the east
by the black sea.

202
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:15,695
Here I sit.
Protecting the
northern border...

203
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,397
Of the land
of piss and shit

204
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:19,532
From simple
barbarian raiders.

205
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:24,237
Mithridates.
Victory against him

206
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:26,739
Would have your name
on every roman's tongue.

207
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:29,676
Cotta leads
the assault.

208
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,544
He steals your laurels.

209
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:33,513
He's the consul.
Theft is his privilege.

210
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:37,884
Father will be
disappointed.

211
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:41,087
He secured this position
for you to shine.

212
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:43,489
And here you sit.
Eclipsed.

213
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,525
I'm doing what I can.

214
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,465
Of course you are.
I just

215
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,467
Wish you were back home.

216
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:57,704
Father's planning
a full day

217
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:00,406
Of spectacles
and gladiators!

218
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:02,742
It's the talk of capua.

219
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,644
I hadn't realized
elections were nearing.

220
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:08,214
Never too
early to campaign.

221
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:10,883
If things were
heading better,

222
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:13,987
You could
be by his side.

223
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:15,922
If.

224
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:20,226
So serious!
Bad for the humors.

225
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:32,639
Come. You haven't
tasted your gift yet.

226
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:12,178
[ struggling ]

227
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,596
[dogs bark and men
shout in distance]

228
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:31,864
They're breaking camp.

229
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:33,299
Frightened
little gashes,

230
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:37,170
Running away with their cocks
between their cheeks.

231
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:38,171
Retreat would
take them beyond

232
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:40,206
The mountains
to the north.

233
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:42,041
Their tores bear west.

234
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:43,643
West?

235
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:45,878
They're swinging
around to attack the
villages below the pass.

236
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:50,383
Our villages.

237
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,185
Slippery little cunts.

238
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:55,822
They break for the
mountain pass here.

239
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:57,790
It will take
them four days at most,

240
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,359
To reach the villages below.

241
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:03,830
Food. Supplies. Women...
All unprotected.

242
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,969
It's a simple thing
to be turned in the
mountains at night.

243
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:12,572
Perhaps I should
send a roman

244
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,607
To properly
assess the situation.

245
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,176
Send the gods themselves.
They'll report the same.

246
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,881
Dismissed.

247
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:23,716
If we March
by midday we can easily...

248
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:26,052
Dismissed!

249
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:45,071
The barbarians head west.

250
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:46,506
So it appears.

251
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:49,742
Further yet from
mithridates and the greeks.

252
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,244
And the glory
you deserve.

253
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:56,816
Return to capua.

254
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:02,388
And my father?

255
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:05,558
How will he measure the man he
so blessed with his daughter?

256
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:15,168
A colossus, towering
above the enemies of rome.

257
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,543
Pompous, arrogant,
roman boy-lover!

258
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,011
All but called us liars.

259
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:26,012
How are you certain?

260
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,713
You heard at he said.

261
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,115
"turned in
the mountains at night!"

262
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:30,616
Like he's speaking
to children!

263
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:33,119
No, no about the boys.
How do you know he favors them?

264
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:34,520
Now who's having a laugh?

265
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:37,156
Well there is this tickle
at the back of my throat.

266
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:39,826
That would be the cock
glaber just forced down it.

267
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:41,627
If he wants to send his
own men let him.

268
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:43,162
Won't change
the direction of the getae.

269
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,732
Glaber is the most
dangerous kind of fool.

270
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,100
One with a title.

271
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:50,703
Truth. But perhaps
he has better sense

272
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,806
When it comes to wine.
[chuckles]

273
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,041
You stole his wine?!

274
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:58,211
Only borrowed it. Plan
to piss it all back shortly.

275
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:08,321
[sound of
sharpening sword]

276
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:20,700
[a piercing horn]

277
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:25,838
Up.

278
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:27,373
Uh. Fuck your mother.

279
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:28,708
The romans sound the call.

280
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:31,177
Fuck the romans.
And their fucking horns.

281
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:34,080
Up drenis, you
drunken goat.

282
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:36,315
The legatus
has gained his senses.

283
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:39,719
Is there any wine left?

284
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:41,053
Your belly holds the sum.

285
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:43,022
It may return
the balance presently.

286
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:46,259
How far to
the mouth of the pass?

287
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:47,994
Three days by foot,

288
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:50,263
If we March with meaning.

289
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,265
A drink would spur
my intent.

290
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,602
My village is
only a ways further west.

291
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,337
My wine is yours
after we--

292
00:21:58,405 --> 00:21:59,639
<i>West?</i>

293
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:04,544
We March east,
to challenge mithridates.

294
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:06,512
Did the legatus send his
own men to scout the front?

295
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,548
How the fuck
should I know?

296
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:11,017
They blow their fucking
horns, a roman dog barks

297
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,085
And the gods shit on me.

298
00:22:13,153 --> 00:22:15,087
Welcome to
the fucking auxiliary.

299
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,196
[sigh]

300
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:31,938
A word, legatus?

301
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:35,675
Move to formation.
Advance east.

302
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:38,844
Surely you mean west,
as the getae advance.

303
00:22:38,912 --> 00:22:43,282
Mithridates
and the greeks are
of pressing concern.

304
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,319
You have aligned
yourself with rome.

305
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:49,789
I am its body and voice.

306
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,259
We March east
to the black sea.

307
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:54,760
Fall to formation.

308
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:00,399
Fall to formation.

309
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:05,438
No.

310
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,710
You would defy
an order from your legatus?

311
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:14,046
I gave my word
to defend against the getae.

312
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:17,817
Not to March east
to attack mithridates.

313
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:20,152
You will March
where you are commanded!

314
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,059
Urgh!

315
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:31,364
Kill them!

316
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:33,633
Urrr!
Wait, wait!

317
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:50,182
Urgghh!

318
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:56,255
Haaa!

319
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:57,957
Throw, damn you.

320
00:24:03,997 --> 00:24:05,831
Yah!

321
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:16,976
What have you done,
you stupid shit?!

322
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,645
He did what he had to!

323
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:21,147
Break and
go your way!

324
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,715
West if your
lives are there.

325
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:25,418
If not,
I could give a fuck.

326
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:26,786
Ohh!

327
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:29,155
What of the legatus?

328
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:36,128
Leave him in the mud.

329
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:38,898
Um! Go.

330
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:50,209
[birds singing]

331
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,109
No! Ah!

332

00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:14,794
Yah!

[ grunting ]

338
00:26:31,211 --> 00:26:33,045
Urgh!

339
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,780
Rrrraa!

340
00:26:39,786 --> 00:26:41,554
Uh!

341
00:26:44,724 --> 00:26:46,592
Oh god, oh my god.

342
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,971
[cries in the distance]

343
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,673
The village...

344
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:03,809
[cries and
screams in the distance]

345
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:14,887
We have to go. Now.

346
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,843
They haven't followed.

347
00:27:56,897 --> 00:28:00,065
You were right.
I never should've left.

348
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:05,437
You had given your word.

349
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:07,640
The fault lies with the
romans in breaking theirs.

350
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,246
You're hurt.

351
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:15,748
It's nothing.
Let me see.

352
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:18,284
Sura.
Let me see.

353
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:22,388
Your tone
is disquieting.

354
00:28:22,455 --> 00:28:23,389
You should be
used to it by now.

355
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:34,099
I'm all right.

356
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:39,171
Of course you are.
Hold still...

357
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:55,621
It's gone, isn't it?

358
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,225
The village.

359
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:01,293
Everyone we knew.

360
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:05,798
We'll move south.

361
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:11,704
I had people there once.

362
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:14,006
The getae
won't venture that far.

363
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:15,507
Not to the risk of
thinning their numbers.

364
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:21,914
And the romans?

365
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:27,853
Their concern rests
mithridates to the east.

366
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,126
South it is.

367
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:42,067
I wish I had
been a thousand men.

368
00:29:56,816 --> 00:30:00,019
You did what you could.

369
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:03,188
You came back.
For me.

370
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:07,092
Knowing it
could mean your life.

371
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:19,238
There is no life
without you.

372
00:31:58,037 --> 00:31:59,271
[horse snorts]

373
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:05,878
[ screaming ]

374
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:36,909
My tribune dead.
Half the auxiliary deserted.

375
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:39,811
Now orders recalling
me to rome.

376
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,613
All from your hand.

377
00:32:41,681 --> 00:32:44,783
I own my actions.
But my wife...

378
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:46,652
Has been condemned
to slavery,

379
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:49,087
Courtesy
of her husband.

380
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:52,891
No! No! No!

381
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,462
The shadow
of rome is vast.

382
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,431
And you, thracian,

383
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,266
Will die under it.

384
00:33:11,544 --> 00:33:13,278
[thunder. Rain]

[vomiting]

387
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:28,994
Good of you
to join us.

388
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:31,530
Thought you were
dead there for a while.

389
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:34,766
He smells dead.
Stupid fuck.

390
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:39,771
Argh! Ahh!
Easy, easy.

391
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,306
You've been out for days.

392
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:43,775
[waves crashing]

393
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:48,113
We're at sea?

394
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:50,582
Upon the adriatic.

395
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,452
Bound for capua.

396
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,721
Sura...

397
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:58,257
Your woman?

398
00:33:58,324 --> 00:33:59,458
The romans took her.

399
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:06,198
Best to forget her then.

400
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:09,201
[waves crashing]

401
00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:36,595
[gasps]

402
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:46,538
What if I'd been
an assassin?  [giggles]

403
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:49,341
Father's in town.
He'll be back shortly.

404
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,076
How shortly?

405
00:34:51,144 --> 00:34:54,680
He's not very happy
with you.

406
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:56,815
And his daughter?

407
00:34:56,883 --> 00:35:00,385
She missed her husband.

408
00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:03,722
But fears his reappearance
has come too soon.

409
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:11,129
The games your father
presents the people of capua.

410
00:35:11,197 --> 00:35:12,898
They begin tomorrow.

411
00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:13,965
The feast is tonight?

412
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:17,035
That's to his
purpose in town.

413
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:19,638
I would have a
word with him.

414
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:24,576
It will take more
than one to regain his favor.

415
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,111
The senate chamber
is full of whispers

416
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:30,415
Over your
...Early return.

417
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:36,688
Cheers of the crowd
will still their tongues.

418
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:41,326
Cheers? How will you
draw them, short of victory?

419
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:45,530
By giving them something
few have ever seen:

420
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:49,601
Thracian blood,
spilled in the arena.

421
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:53,338
When the hearts
of the crowd...

422
00:35:53,406 --> 00:35:56,708
And the senate
will beg to follow.

423
00:35:56,776 --> 00:35:57,876
<i>Get out of my sight!</i>

424
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:01,813
<i>Inbred shit whores.</i>

425
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:04,983
I should sale the
lot of you to the mines. Out!

426
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:08,787
Father's returned.
And in a fine state.

427
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:10,989
If he refuses
to aid my intentions...

428
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:13,825
He refuses his
daughter nothing,

429
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:16,161
When pleaded
with teary eye.

430

[crowd claps and cheers]

Good citizens of capua!
Revered guests!

433
00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:48,693
A debt of gratitude
for partaking
in this celebration...

434
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:51,196
Of the family name
of albinius.

435
00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:53,965
Albinius!
Albinius!

[cheering and clapping]

437
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:59,871
Your attendance honors
the memory of my elders,

438
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:02,808
Gone too soon from
the realm of the living...

439
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:06,545
And the joy of a daughter,
yet so full of life.

440
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:12,284
I repay your kindness
with gifts of water!

441
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:13,652
Carried from rome

442
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:16,955
Where the gods have seen
fit to keep the drought at bay!

443
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:21,259
And gifts of blood,
to be spilled in the arena!

444
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:23,361
[crowd cheers]

445
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,933
Quintus lentulus batiatus!

446
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,135
Step forward.

447
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:31,470
[crowd cheers and claps]

448
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:42,147
Present your gladiators.

449
00:37:45,585 --> 00:37:47,419
In honor
of senator albinius

450
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:51,690
And the people
of capua, I give you barca!

451
00:37:51,757 --> 00:37:52,757
The beast of carthage!

[ crowd reacts ]

453
00:37:57,129 --> 00:38:01,333
Yet his ferocity pales
against the titan of the arena!

454
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,069
The god
of blood and sand!

455
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:07,439
Crixus!
The undefeated gaul!

456
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:15,146
Gratitude to batiatus!

457
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:29,227
<i>And now to
marcus decius solonius,</i>

458
00:38:29,295 --> 00:38:30,495
<i>And his offerings!</i>

[crowd cheers]

460
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:39,437
In honor
of senator albinius

461
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:41,573
And the people of capua.

462
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:43,542
I give you six
of my finest men!

463
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:48,413
<i>Behold arkadios!
Scourge of athens!</i>

464
00:38:51,817 --> 00:38:54,219
Preening shit eater.

465
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:56,421
A mockery
to the profession.

466
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:57,422
A mockery is it?

467
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,657
Oh, you disagree?

468
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:01,393
Let it pass.

469
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,762
We're guests
of the senator.

470
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:06,464
He's invited us
to sit in the puinus tomorrow.

471
00:39:06,532 --> 00:39:08,533
As consolation!

472
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:09,668
Only two of my
men have been retained

473
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:10,835
To fight
in tomorrow's games!

474
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:11,937
While solonius
secures half a dozen

475
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:14,439
Of his ill-trained
simians.

476
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:20,312
That man has fingers in
all the proper assholes.

477
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:22,447
He wiggles them
and everyone shits gold.

478
00:39:22,515 --> 00:39:24,015
[ clapping ]

479
00:39:25,384 --> 00:39:26,384
Gratitude to solonius!

480
00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:32,691
But water and games are
distant praise, for the city

481
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:36,494
That has held the name
albinius as its own.

482
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:38,463
More is deserved!

483
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:39,965
And the gods
have seen fit

484
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,735
To deliver it in the form
of my daughter's husband,

485
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,870
Legatus claudius glaber.

[crowd cheers]

487
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:50,075
Newly returned from
the savage lands of thrace!

[crowd cheers and claps]

489
00:40:07,593 --> 00:40:11,830
More gifts for
the people of capua!

490
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:15,467
Six thracian jackals!

491
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:20,205
Deserters from the war against
the barbaric getae!

492
00:40:20,272 --> 00:40:25,410
To be executed ad gladium
in tomorrow's games!

493
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:27,646
[crowd cheers and claps]

494
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:29,948
Well?
Um!

495
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:41,626
He is well received.

496
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:42,894
Ask favor
for him again,

497
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:46,665
And your tears will
fall short of notice.

498
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:51,069
Right now to
more music and drink! Um!
[music plays]

499
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:05,917
Thracians.
Between those animals

500
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:08,086
And solonius'
inferior offerings.

501
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:09,454
A mockery,
on all accounting.

502
00:41:09,522 --> 00:41:10,755
Glaber mentions execution.

503
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:13,058
Perhaps a word could
lend our men to the task.

504
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,060
The position has
been occupied.

505
00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:19,030
Good solonius! I was
just marveling at your wares!

506
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:20,965
Oh and I at yours...

507
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:23,168
Oh you flatter.

508
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:25,704
No, I appreciate.

509
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:27,472
Good to lay eyes,
old friend.

510
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,408
I feared for a time
you would be excluded.

511
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:33,378
Games absent batiatus?!
A dawn without the sun!

512
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:37,415
Ah, crixus and barca.
Two fine entries.

513
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:39,250
They should
provide distraction between

514
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:40,385
The more important bouts.

515
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:46,991
The senator beckons.

516
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:48,993
If I miss you at the
games tomorrow, lucretia...

517
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:51,930
Well its unlikely.
We've been invited to sit
in the pulvinus.

518
00:41:51,997 --> 00:41:54,432
The pulvinus?
With the senator?

519
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,535
A great honor.

520
00:41:57,603 --> 00:41:58,770
I'll enjoy
your company there.

521
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:04,709
I shall witness his
heart on a day.

522
00:42:04,777 --> 00:42:07,278
Parted from
his chest.

523
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:08,613
And I shall grip
the knife.

524
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:30,301
I've never beheld
such sights.

525
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:34,072
Nor will you again.

526
00:43:06,172 --> 00:43:07,906
[crowd howls]

[ gurgling ]

531
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:04,756
The crowd approves his gifts.

532
00:45:04,823 --> 00:45:06,524
As do we all.

533
00:45:06,592 --> 00:45:09,527
I've withheld something
of note for the last...

534
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,234
[trumpets sound]

535
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:25,677

[ breathing hard ]

537
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:40,525
Ready?
Thracian cunt.

538
00:45:44,163 --> 00:45:45,229
[gates open]

539
00:46:00,646 --> 00:46:01,846
Yaaaa!

[crowd disapproves]

542
00:46:13,058 --> 00:46:15,526
The odds seem
out of favor.

543
00:46:15,594 --> 00:46:18,029
This thracian caused
rome a great disservice, father.

544
00:46:18,097 --> 00:46:20,865
His cowardice
led to mass desertion.

545
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:24,168
Is his life
not ample repayment?

546
00:46:24,236 --> 00:46:28,072
He must be
humiliated in example.

547
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,707
Solonius was
kind enough to offer

548
00:46:29,775 --> 00:46:31,976
His services in this act.

549
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:37,248
[crowd boos]

550
00:46:38,784 --> 00:46:40,551
[ sighs]
give the command.

551
00:47:05,878 --> 00:47:06,811
Crowd: No!

552
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:20,024
Ah!

553
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:27,198
Uh!

554
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,555
Gladiator [laughs]
[crowd boos]

555
00:47:57,262 --> 00:47:58,963
A mockery.

556
00:47:59,031 --> 00:47:59,997
Be still.

557
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:07,371

<i>[ chanting ]

565
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:22,473
Well this presents
some difficulty.

566
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,709
The sentence
of death holds.

567
00:50:24,776 --> 00:50:26,844
But to defy the wishes
of the crowd,

568
00:50:26,912 --> 00:50:28,246
It's not wise.

569
00:50:28,313 --> 00:50:29,680
Even for a senator.

570
00:50:29,748 --> 00:50:31,849
He gave me grievance,
I will not see him freed!

571
00:50:32,951 --> 00:50:34,819
A solution, perhaps.

572
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:37,488
If you will entertain,
legatus?

573
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:39,890
The thracian shown
promise in the arena albeit

574
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:43,194
Against solonius's
inferior stock,

575
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:45,596
I have a batch of new recruits
arriving tomorrow.

576
00:50:45,664 --> 00:50:48,199
If I were to purchase
this man in addition

577
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:51,235
To be trained at my ludus
in the gladiatorial arts,

578
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:53,037
Why in his condition,

579
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:55,139
I doubt he'll survive
to the quarter moon.

[ chanting ]

581
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,649
We will be merciful, hm?

582
00:51:04,716 --> 00:51:07,285
And by such,
gain the favor you seek.

583
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:12,823
What name does
the man carry.

584
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:14,925
I never cared to ask.

585
00:51:16,662 --> 00:51:18,729
The way he fights,

586
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:21,532
Like the legend
of the thracian king of old.

587

[ cheering ]

588

This man,
this spartacus,

591
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:49,060
Has proven himself
in the arena

592

For this
legatus claudius glaber and I

Grant him--
