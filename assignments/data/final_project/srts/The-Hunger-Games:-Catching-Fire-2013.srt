1
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:15,785
Oh, whoa.

2
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,787
Easy.

3
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,544
Saw some turkeys on the way here.

4
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:29,173
Crossed right in front of me
like I wasn't even there.

5
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,300
- How rude of them.
- That's what happens.

6
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,802
You spend six days a week
working in the mines

7
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:37,140
and stupid birds start to
think they own these woods.

8
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,187
When's the tour leave?

9
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,063
Couple hours.

10
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,608
Well, let's go.

11
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,704
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:44,040
Hey, whoa. You're okay.

13
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,169
You're okay. You're safe. You're safe.

14
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,296
It's okay. You're here with me.

15
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,464
You're with me.

16
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,140
Okay, okay.

17
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,142
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,399
Oh, we... We should...

19
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,236
We should go.

20
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,507
<i>Are you coming
to the train station?</i>

21
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:38,219
I think you have enough
people saying goodbye without me there.

22
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,555
Only a few I actually care about.

23
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,267
It might be easier if I didn't.

24
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,104
It's only a few weeks.

25
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,629
I'll be back before the snow melts.

26
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,941
Yeah, a lot can happen in a few weeks.

27
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,235
Are we gonna do this again?

28
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,320
Gale, it was an act.

29
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,197
Yeah, it was a good one.

30
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,658
I did what I had to do to survive.

31
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,785
If I didn't, I'd be dead.

32
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,129
I had to do that.

33
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,174
At least once.

34
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,162
Haymitch!

35
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,501
Haymitch!

36
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,677
Haymitch, wake up. It's Tour Day.

37
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,179
Haymitch.

38
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,529
What are you doing?

39
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,197
Cameras are gonna be here in an hour.

40
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:26,284
If you wanted to be babied,
you should've asked Peeta.

41
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,745
Asked me what?

42
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,623
Asked you to wake me
without giving me pneumonia.

43
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,961
You are a strangely dislikeable person.

44
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,215
But you do have your virtues.

45
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,658
Would you like some bread, Katniss?

46
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,095
No, I ate at the Hob, but thank you.

47
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,346
You're welcome.

48
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,765
Brr.

49
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,811
You two have a lot
of warming up to do before show time.

50
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,982
Which is in an hour, so
take a bath, Haymitch.

51
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,276
I just did.

52
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,744
Did you have a good walk, dear?

53
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:10,329
- Walk? I was just out.
- We have visitors.

54
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,500
Miss Everdeen. This way, please.

55
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,350
Such bravery.

56
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,145
Such spirit.

57
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:35,772
Such...

58
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,525
Contempt.

59
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,570
President Snow.

60
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,155
What an honor.

61
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:48,033
My dear, I think we can make
this so much simpler

62
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,868
if we agree not to lie to each other.

63
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:50,994
What do you think?

64
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,789
Yes, I think that would save time.

65
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,916
Sit down, please.

66
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,552
I have a problem, Miss Everdeen.

67
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,596
A problem that began
the moment you revealed

68
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,641
those poison berries in the arena.

69
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,184
If that Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane,

70
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,812
had had any brains at all,

71
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,855
he would have blown you
to bits then and there.

72
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,315
But here you are.

73
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,485
I expect you can guess where he is.

74
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,278
Yes, I think so.

75
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,572
After that fiasco, there
was nothing left to do

76
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:30,076
but to let you play out
your little scenario.

77
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,537
And you were very good.

78
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:36,248
That whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.

79
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,250
Impressive. Truly.

80
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,461
You convinced the people in The Capitol.

81
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,924
Unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.

82
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,510
I mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,

83
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,096
people viewed your little
trick with the berries

84
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,890
as an act of defiance.

85
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,017
Not as an act of love.

86
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,728
And if a girl from
District 12 of all places

87
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:01,107
can defy The Capitol
and walk away unharmed,

88
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,567
what is to prevent them
from doing the same?

89
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,570
What is to prevent, say,

90
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,572
an uprising?

91
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,700
That can lead to revolution.

92
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,784
And then, in a fraction of time,

93
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:13,995
the whole system collapses.

94
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,871
It must be a fragile system,

95
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,040
if it can be brought down
by just a few berries.

96
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,876
Yes, it is, indeed.

97
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,503
But not in the way you imagine it.

98
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,046
How should I imagine?

99
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,300
You should imagine thousands upon
thousands of your people dead.

100
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:31,512
This town of yours reduced to ashes.
Imagine it gone.

101
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,722
Made radioactive. Buried under dirt

102
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:36,475
as if it had never
existed, like District 13.

103
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,523
You fought very hard
in The Games, Miss Everdeen.

104
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:45,568
But they were games.

105
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,404
Would you like to be in a real war?

106
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,863
No.

107
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:52,408
Good. Neither would I.

108
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,744
Did your mother make these?

109
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,246
Peeta.

110
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,249
Oh. He's a lovely boy.

111
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,418
Tell me.

112
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,589
At what point did he
realize the depth of your

113
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,508
indifference towards him?

114
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,677
- I'm not indifferent.
- Don't lie!

115
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,763
You promised.

116
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,435
Why don't you just kill me now?

117
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,857
I don't want to kill you.

118
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,860
I want us to be friends.

119
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,404
But if not friends, then allies.

120
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:31,863
What do I need to do?

121
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,532
When you and Peeta are on tour,

122
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,620
you need to smile. You need to be grateful.

123
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,537
But, above all,

124
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,872
you need to be madly,

125
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,124
prepared-to-end-it-all in love.

126
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,292
You think you can manage that?

127
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,294
Yes.

128
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,462
Yes, what?

129
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,422
I'll convince them.

130
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,548
No.

131
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,384
Convince me.

132
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,472
For you, Miss Everdeen.

133
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,647
Do convince me.

134
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,484
For the sake of your loved ones.

135
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,792
Stop.

136
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,003
Take it all in.

137
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,840
This is sacred ground.

138
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,593
History was made here.

139
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,846
Oh.

140
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,181
You'll get used to the smell.

141
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,018
Hmm.

142
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,351
Hello!

143
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,519
Oh!

144
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,481
There she is. My greatest triumph!

145
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,025
Our little superstar.

146
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:51,694
Sweetie, we've missed you.

147
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,529
What a cute little house.

148
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,864
So quaint, isn't it?

149
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,199
Of course, you've heard about Cinna?

150
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,616
What happened to Cinna?

151
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,872
Oh, dear, he's a fashion star.
You're his muse.

152
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,206
Everyone in The Capitol's wearing him.
Everyone.

153
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,875
- Everyone.
- Well, not everyone.

154
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:07,877
Oh!

155
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,337
Cinna!

156
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,715
Katniss?

157
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:15,968
Katniss, is this your sister?

158
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,219
Oh, sweetie!

159
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,387
Are you okay?

160
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,804
Oh, just adorable!

161
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,557
- Yeah.
- Ready to work?

162
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,560
- Yeah.
- All right. Good.

163
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:28,063
Welcome!

164
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,652
Last year, the 74th Hunger Games

165
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,405
brought us the greatest
love story of our time.

166
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:39,742
Two brave young people, against all odds

167
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:43,370
chose to die rather than
to lose each other.

168
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,749
As a nation, we shared their agony.

169
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,170
But we had so little time
to revel in their joy.

170
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,922
It's time!

171
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:56,425
She's done, she's lovely.
We must feed the monster.

172
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:57,926
All right now.

173
00:11:57,927 --> 00:11:59,010
<i>Let's go to District 12</i>

174
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,554
<i>and find our star-crossed lovers!</i>

175
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,097
You're excited. You're in love.

176
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:05,518
Big smiles for the camera
in three, two, one.

177
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,604
<i>There she is! Katniss Everdeen!</i>

178
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,772
<i>The Girl on Fire.</i>

179
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,531
<i>And there he is! Peeta Mellark!</i>

180
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,116
<i>The Baker's Boy.</i>

181
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,790
Ooh.

182
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,792
<i>Uh-oh. Whoa, oh.</i>

183
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,627
<i>Trouble in paradise</i>

184
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,963
<i>I hope they're all right.</i>

185
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,467
<i>- Um...</i>
- Ahem.

186
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,843
<i>Anyone at home?</i>

187
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,324
<i>Should we come back later?</i>

188
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,764
Sorry, Caesar.

189
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,934
Oh, please. It's all right. It's your day.

190
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,270
<i>It's your day. So how's it going?</i>

191
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,647
We're good.

192
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,568
<i>That's it? That's all we get? "We're good"?</i>

193
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:59,238
<i>So taciturn all of a sudden.
Peeta, give me some details!</i>

194
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,411
Yeah, things are, uh...
Things are great here in 12.

195
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,497
Thanks to the generosity of The Capitol,

196
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,999
we've never been closer.

197
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,667
25 yards, to be exact.

198
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,753
<i>Fantastic!</i>

199
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,671
We'll be checking in with both of you

200
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,174
throughout the Victory Tour.

201
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:19,507
<i>Thank you so much,</i>

202
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,343
<i>Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!</i>

203
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,180
Wonderful!

204
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,933
Everybody in motion. We
are out of here in 10.

205
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,185
That was nice acting.

206
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,437
You, too.

207
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,023
Almost thought that kiss was real.

208
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,192
Come along, children,
we are on a schedule.

209
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:38,527
The train awaits!

210
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,032
Fabulous food, fabulous wine,

211
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,700
the massages, spa treatments. I told them

212
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,495
nothing but the best for my two Victors.

213
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,539
It all needs to be, uh...

214
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,832
Fabulous?

215
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:52,958
Exactly.

216
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,543
Now, the schedule is a bit of a bear.

217
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,795
12 days, 12 districts.

218
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,215
But it's mostly parties, celebrations,

219
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:02,384
adoring fans to greet you
at every stop along the way,

220
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,803
and then we wrap it up in The Capitol.

221
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,055
All you need to do is give a few speeches,

222
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,389
wave to the crowds,

223
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,642
and enjoy your time in the spotlight.

224
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:11,727
You've earned it.

225
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,394
What did you say?

226
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,730
Katniss.

227
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:19,360
I said, "Enjoy it, Katniss,
you've earned it."

228
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,403
By killing people.

229
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,324
Young lady...

230
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,597
I'm really not in the mood for a lecture.

231
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,891
I'll apologize to Effie later.

232
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,269
I thought you were Haymitch.

233
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,690
You don't have to apologize to anybody.

234
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,941
Including me.

235
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,943
I know it's not fair of me

236
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,780
to hold you to things
you said in The Games.

237
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,617
You saved us. I know that.

238
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,121
But I can't go on acting for the cameras,

239
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,082
and then just ignoring
each other in real life.

240
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,711
So if you can stop looking
at me like I'm wounded,

241
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,213
then I can quit acting like it.

242
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,093
And then maybe we have
a shot at being friends.

243
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,887
I've never been very good at friends.

244
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,141
For starters, it does help
when you know the person.

245
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,392
I hardly know anything about you

246
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,562
except that you're stubborn
and good with a bow.

247
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,605
That about sums me up.

248
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,275
No, there's more than that,
you just don't want to tell me.

249
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,818
It's like I said, I'm...

250
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,987
See, Katniss, the way
the whole friend thing works is you have to

251
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,282
tell each other the deep stuff.

252
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:49,992
- The deep stuff?
- Yeah.

253
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,160
Uh-oh. Like what?

254
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,327
Like, uh...

255
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,454
What's your favorite color?

256
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:56,016
Well, now you've stepped over the line.

257
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,626
Seriously, though, what is it?

258
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,005
Green.

259
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,174
What's yours?

260
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,633
Orange.

261
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,135
Like Effie's hair?

262
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,512
No.
Not that orange.

263
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,016
More, uh... More like a
sunset kind of orange.

264
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,530
Did you see that?

265
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,532
What?

266
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,038
Whoa.

267
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,724
Well, I never.

268
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,894
This is not very festive.

269
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,648
The mayor will make
some introductory remarks.

270
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,733
And then you just have to say a few words.

271
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,151
It's customary, of course,
to give a brief eulogy

272
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,987
to the district's fallen Tributes.

273
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,574
For 11, that's Thresh and Rue.

274
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,910
Here are the speeches.

275
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,248
I can do the talking if you want.

276
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,416
Thank you.

277
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,750
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

278
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,712
the Victors of the 74th Hunger Games.

279
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,883
Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!

280
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,384
Smile, smile, smile, smile.

281
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,094
Stand up straight. You're on camera.

282
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,771
Thank you.

283
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,942
We're honored to be here with you today.

284
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,737
And to be with the families
of your fallen Tributes.

285
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,623
He put down the cards.

286
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,292
<i>Though they fought...</i>

287
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,419
<i>- ...and lived with honor...</i>
- Why do I bother?

288
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,796
<i>...and dignity until the end,</i>

289
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,299
both Thresh and Rue

290
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,135
were so young.

291
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,973
But our lives aren't
just measured in years.

292
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:22,686
They're measured in the lives
of people we touch around us.

293
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,230
For myself,

294
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:27,983
for Katniss,

295
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,073
we know that without
Rue and without Thresh,

296
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:37,242
we wouldn't be standing here today.

297
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,660
So in recognition of that,

298
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,998
knowing that it in no way
can make up for your loss,

299
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,501
we'd like to donate
one month of our winnings

300
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,337
to the families of the
Tributes, every year,

301
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,589
for the rest of our lives.

302
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,841
Oh, shit.

303
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,219
Can he do that?

304
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,013
He can't. But he did.

305
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:01,016
Why doesn't
he just stick to the cards?

306
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,684
Thank you.

307
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,866
I just wanted to say that

308
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:21,662
I didn't know Thresh.
I only spoke to him once.

309
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,204
He could have killed me,

310
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,332
but instead he showed me mercy.

311
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,211
That's a debt I'll never be able to repay.

312
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,633
I did know Rue.

313
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,470
She wasn't just my ally, she was my friend.

314
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,478
I see her in the flowers
that grow in the meadow by my house.

315
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,690
I hear her in a Mockingjay song.

316
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,528
I see her in my sister Prim.

317
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,366
She was too young,

318
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,828
too gentle.

319
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,416
And I couldn't save her.

320
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,920
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:38,905
No! No!

322
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,866
Wait! Wait!

323
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,909
No! Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

324
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,620
No! Let me go! Please leave him alone!

325
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,788
No!

326
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:48,623
No!

327
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,125
No!

328
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,880
You! No, no, no!

329
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,929
Come here! Stop it!

330
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,300
Stop it! Stop!

331
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,548
What did I do?

332
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,719
Come on.

333
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:02,970
Shut up.

334
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,307
In all my years, I've never seen...

335
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,981
You two have a very simple task.

336
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,273
I never meant for anyone to get killed.

337
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,316
He has to know that.

338
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,902
What are you talking about?
Who has to know what?

339
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,071
Snow. He came to see me.

340
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,162
He's worried about rebellion
in the districts.

341
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,325
He thinks that they don't
believe our love story.

342
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,494
So he wants
you to make them believe it?

343
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,745
- To calm things down.
- You know, Katniss,

344
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,330
you shoulda told me
that before I went out there,

345
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,457
and tried to give these people the money.

346
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,022
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.

347
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,405
He threatened to kill my family.

348
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,169
Well, I have family, too.

349
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,610
Okay? People that I need to protect.

350
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:39,007
What about them? Who protects them?

351
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,969
Katniss, what were you thinking?

352
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,346
I was thinking about Rue.

353
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:45,679
Haymitch, please...

354
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,515
Please, just help me get through this trip.

355
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,101
Please, just help us get through this.

356
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,268
This trip? Girl, wake up.

357
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,188
This trip doesn't end
when you get back home.

358
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,690
You never get off this train.

359
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,027
You two are mentors now.

360
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,696
That means that every year,
they're gonna drag you out,

361
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,699
and broadcast the details of your romance.

362
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,120
Every year, your private
life becomes theirs.

363
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,705
From now on, your job
is to be a distraction.

364
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,542
So people forget what
the real problems are.

365
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,959
- So what do we do?
- You're gonna smile.

366
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,047
You're gonna read the cards
that Effie gives you.

367
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,967
And you're gonna live happily ever after.

368
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,552
Think you can do that?

369
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,512
Huh?

370
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:27,722
Yeah?

371
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,683
Come here.

372
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,901
You're gonna be okay. I promise.

373
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,322
<i>Katniss and I want
to share with you our victory.</i>

374
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,906
And our gratitude to The Capitol

375
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,200
for bringing us together.

376
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,326
It was the bond of love,

377
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,329
forged in the crucible of The Games

378
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,039
<i>that was our greatest prize.</i>

379
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,916
<i>For it is love and true love</i>

380
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,294
<i>that allows us all to bear our hardships.</i>

381
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,920
<i>That mends the heart</i>

382
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,132
<i>and banishes loneliness and
gives meaning to our lives.</i>

383
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:06,802
We also want to share with you
the sorrows of your losses.

384
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,388
The Tributes of this...

385
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,983
The Tributes of this district
were brave and noble warriors.

386
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,775
They brought honor to their families

387
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,903
and pride to their people.

388
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,990
<i>We are all of us united,
both victors and vanquished,</i>

389
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,074
<i>in serving a common purpose.</i>

390
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,578
Thank you.

391
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,624
One day, I'm gonna volunteer.
Just like you did.

392
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,675
It was just a dream. I'm sorry.

393
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,677
It's okay. I get 'em, too.

394
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,555
Goodnight.

395
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:51,890
Peeta.

396
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,268
Will you stay with me?

397
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,604
Yeah.

398
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,654
Always.

399
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,828
<i>We are all of us united,</i>

400
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,081
<i>both victors and vanquished,</i>

401
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,708
<i>in serving a common purpose.</i>

402
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,669
The power and glory

403
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,128
- of The Capitol.
- Put down the cards!

404
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,506
Tell us what you really think!

405
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:29,426
Panem today. Panem tomorrow.
Panem forever.

406
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,858
Your hair looks lovely, darling.

407
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,778
When did you start wearing it like that?

408
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,782
Everyone at school wears it
like this now, Grandpa.

409
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,496
Snow is watching us.

410
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,999
If he wants you to pacify the districts,

411
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,167
I promise you, he's not happy.

412
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,751
Instead of being in love,

413
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,378
you two sound like you're reciting

414
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,714
from a drilling manual.

415
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,842
You try reading that stuff
that Effie writes us.

416
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:11,094
Tell that to President Snow
when you see him two days from now.

417
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:12,803
I'm open to suggestions.

418
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,347
We could get married.

419
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,599
That's not helping.

420
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,268
I'm serious.

421
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,478
If, like you said, we're
on this train forever,

422
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,897
it's gonna happen eventually.

423
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,107
Why not now?

424
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,821
It does make a statement.
I'll give you that.

425
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,867
Yeah, sure. Let's do it.

426
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,332
<i>Just when you thought
things couldn't get more exciting</i>

427
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,793
<i>going into a very special Quarter Quell,</i>

428
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:47,091
our two lethal lovers...
My favorite expression.

429
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,883
...from District 12

430
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:53,344
have surprised us
with a new twist in their love affair.

431
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,804
Let's take a look.

432
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,725
Aw...

433
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:03,355
A fairy tale ending
for two star-crossed lovers.

434
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,648
<i>That's beautiful. Beautiful.</i>

435
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:07,734
<i>And then tonight,</i>

436
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:11,696
<i>the tour that began
in the hollows of District 12</i>

437
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,782
<i>will end where?</i>

438
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,658
The Presidential Palace.

439
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:18,161
The party of the year.

440
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,998
Eyes bright. Chins up. Smiles on.

441
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,542
I'm talking to you, Katniss.

442
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,463
Now, there'll be photographers. Interviews.

443
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:32,634
Everyone will be here to celebrate you.

444
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,802
My Victors.

445
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,558
Breathe it all in, children.

446
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,895
This is all for you.

447
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,021
It's cozy.

448
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,940
Attitude.

449
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,611
Come, come.

450
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,197
Come along.

451
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,409
Excuse us, excuse us.

452
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,126
Come, come.

453
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,215
Hold hands.

454
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,471
And the library. All mahogany.

455
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,764
Hello, hello!

456
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,724
Not yet, not yet. No, no, no.

457
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,143
Ooh, curtains!

458
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,770
Everybody who's anybody is here.

459
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,856
And they all want to meet you.

460
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,900
Flavius! Octavia!

461
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,702
Try one of these. They are divine.

462
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,328
No, I can't eat another thing.

463
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,289
- Here.
- What's this?

464
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:47,000
It's for when you're full.

465
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,793
It makes you sick.

466
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,628
So you can go on eating.

467
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,214
How else could you taste everything?

468
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,010
I think it's time for a dance.

469
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:58,720
Katniss?

470
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,649
People are starving in 12.

471
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:15,068
Here, they're just throwing
it up to stuff more in.

472
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,320
Katniss? Peeta.

473
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:21,326
This is Plutarch Heavensbee.
Head Gamemaker.

474
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,203
Successor to Seneca Crane.

475
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,580
That's a tough act to follow.

476
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,165
Peeta!

477
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,668
May I?

478
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,128
Please.

479
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,804
So how do you like the party?

480
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,849
It's a little overwhelming.

481
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,393
It's appalling.

482
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,440
Still, if you abandon your moral judgment,
it can be fun.

483
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,276
So are you having fun?

484
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,571
I'm the Head Gamemaker. Fun is my job.

485
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:02,242
Thought that was what happened
to Seneca Crane. Too much fun.

486
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:07,372
Seneca decided to quit breathing.

487
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:08,915
Decided.

488
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,125
It was that or poison berries.

489
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,877
Being Head Gamemaker has never been

490
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,089
the most secure job in the world.

491
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,258
Then why are you here?

492
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,302
Same reason as you. I volunteered.

493
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,721
Why?

494
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:25,848
Ambition.

495
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,520
The chance to make The Games
mean something.

496
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,690
The Games don't mean anything.

497
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,858
They only mean to scare us.

498
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,611
Well, maybe it was you
who inspired me to come back.

499
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,283
Ah!

500
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,827
The Presidential welcome.

501
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,204
I'm sure we'll meet again.

502
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,833
Katniss, come. The President awaits.

503
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,044
You think we convinced him?

504
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,755
I'm not sure what else we can do.

505
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:13,938
Tonight,

506
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,358
on this, the last day of their tour,

507
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,820
I want to welcome our two Victors.

508
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:25,450
Two young people who embody our ideals

509
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,745
of strength and valor.

510
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:35,084
And I, personally, want
to congratulate them

511
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,546
on the announcement of their engagement.

512
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,677
Your love has inspired us.

513
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:49,641
And I know it will go on inspiring us

514
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,976
every day

515
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,937
for as long as you may live.

516
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:09,971
<i>Look at them.</i>

517
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,472
She's not who they think she is.

518
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,599
She's not a leader.

519
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,728
She just wants to save her own skin.
It's as simple as that.

520
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,521
I think that's true.

521
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,357
But she's become
a beacon of hope for the rebellion.

522
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,068
And she has to be eliminated.

523
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,363
I agree she should die.
But in the right way.

524
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,198
At the right time.

525
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:31,993
It's moves and countermoves.
And it's all we gotta look at.

526
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:35,580
Katniss Everdeen is a symbol.
Their Mockingjay.

527
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,372
They think she's one of them.

528
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:39,625
We need to show that she's one of us.

529
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,377
We don't need to destroy her.
Just the image.

530
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,795
Then we let the people do the rest.

531
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,173
What do you propose?

532
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,673
Shut down the black markets.

533
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,134
Take away what little they have.

534
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,636
Then double the amount
of floggings and executions.

535
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:54,307
Put them on TV. Broadcast them live.

536
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:57,560
Sow fear. More fear.

537
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,772
It won't work. Fear does not
work as long as they have hope.

538
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,774
And Katniss Everdeen is giving them hope.

539
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:04,859
She's engaged.

540
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,610
Make everything about that.

541
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,155
What kinda dress is she gonna wear?
Floggings.

542
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,532
What's the cake gonna look like?
Executions.

543
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,659
Who's gonna be there? Fear.

544
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,204
Blanket coverage. Shove it in their faces.

545
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,581
Show them that she is one of us now.

546
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:21,416
They're gonna hate her so much,

547
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,697
they might just kill her for you

548
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,130
Brilliant.

549
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,143
When did you...

550
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,360
We need to talk.

551
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,740
Where are we gonna run away?

552
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,742
Into the woods. Like we
always talked about.

553
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:57,118
If we leave right now,

554
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,720
we can be far away from here by tonight.

555
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,372
Yeah, who's "we"?

556
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:01,541
You, me and your fiancé?

557
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,794
It's not just me and Peeta any more.

558
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,487
Snow threatened to have you killed.

559
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,466
Anyone else?

560
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,551
Well, he didn't exactly
give me a copy of the list

561
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,846
but a good guess,
it includes both of our families.

562
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,615
Unless what? You and Peeta get married?

563
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,307
Unless nothing now.

564
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:19,892
Gale, we can do it.

565
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:23,061
You said yourself that we could do
it the morning of the Reaping.

566
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,481
What do you say now?

567
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:26,941
Do you love me?

568
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,069
Gale, you know how I feel about you.

569
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:32,738
But I can't think about
anyone that way right now.

570
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:34,155
The only thing that I can think about

571
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:35,949
every day, every waking moment

572
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,743
since the Reaping, is how afraid I am.

573
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,453
There's no room for anything else.

574
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,039
But maybe, if we got away from here,

575
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,749
if we went somewhere safe,
it could be different.

576
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,793
I could be different.

577
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,336
You think maybe the President's bluffing?

578
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,130
He's not bluffing.

579
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:52,048
Not with what's going on in the districts.

580
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,092
What do you mean?

581
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,095
What did you see?

582
00:34:57,013 --> 00:35:00,307
There were people fighting
in the streets, and fires,

583
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:02,017
and Peacekeepers were gunning them down,

584
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,686
but the people were...

585
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,104
What? The people were what?

586
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:06,439
They were fighting back.

587
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,317
It's happening.

588
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:11,402
It's finally happening.

589
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,070
I should've just eaten
the berries in the arena

590
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,697
and died like I was supposed to.

591
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:18,034
Then everything would be back
to normal and everyone would be safe.

592
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,493
Safe for what?

593
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,245
To starve? Work like slaves?

594
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,623
Send their kids to the Reaping?

595
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,415
You haven't hurt people, Katniss.

596
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,833
You've given them an opportunity.

597
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,545
They just have to be
brave enough to take it.

598
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:32,173
There's already talk in the mines.
People wanna fight.

599
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,674
We have to go, Gale, before they kill us.

600
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:35,885
They Will kill us.

601
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,720
What about the other families? Huh?

602
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:41,182
The ones who stay. What happens to them?

603
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:42,766
People are looking to you, Katniss.

604
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,894
I don't want anyone looking to me.

605
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,395
I can't help them.

606
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,033
You do what you want.

607
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:00,785
I'm staying here.

608
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:21,555
Commander Thread,

609
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,682
welcome to District 12.

610
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,066
Let's get to work.

611
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,803
- Let's go! Keep moving!
- Stay close!

612
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,135
<i>Find and clear.</i>

613
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,886
<i>Burn all contraband.</i>

614
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,689
Let me go!

615
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:38,758
Ripper!

616
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:39,925
My eye!

617
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,259
I'm gonna get you out of here.

618
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,261
No!

619
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,346
Leave her be! Stop!

620
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:48,224
No!

621
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,568
In the square.

622
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,202
Here.

623
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:13,334
Yeah, hold that on there.

624
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:32,978
No!

625
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:35,773
No! No! Stop!

626
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:42,529
Katniss!

627
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:44,865
It's okay.

628
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,493
Just go. It's okay.

629
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:54,917
Move.

630
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,045
You want another?

631
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,338
Go ahead.

632
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,549
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Get out of my way!

633
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,842
No, you don't want to shoot her.

634
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,043
How about I shoot both of you?

635
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:07,221
Look, Commander, you're new here.

636
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,890
Trust me, I'm trying to help you.

637
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,183
I'm Haymitch.

638
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:14,562
You recognize her? Katniss Everdeen.

639
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,896
Darling of The Capitol.

640
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,776
She interfered with a Peacekeeper.

641
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,403
I never said she was smart.

642
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:26,573
Look, you already got
a couple of lashes in, right?

643
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,576
That's not good enough. She's an agitator.

644
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:30,578
Easy, easy.

645
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:31,745
Look...

646
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:33,746
You're sure Snow
wants three dead Victors here?

647
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,248
Because that's what we're looking at.

648
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:37,625
It's bad enough that you marked up her face

649
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,086
on the eve of the big wedding.

650
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:42,089
Let it go. And we will, too.

651
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,100
All right.

652
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:57,771
Okay.

653
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:03,277
But next time, it's the firing squad.

654
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,446
Excellent idea.

655
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,406
I don't care who she is.

656
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,619
Clear the square!

657
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,414
You're all under curfew.

658
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,293
Anyone out after dark

659
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,588
will be shot on sight.

660
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,801
Get 'em outta here.

661
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,307
It's Gale.

662
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:35,768
Get him here.

663
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:39,646
Here we go.

664
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,107
Really easy. Up, up

665
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,318
Okay.

666
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,362
Okay. Thanks.

667
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:47,988
New head Peacekeeper.

668
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,615
Not entirely peaceful.

669
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,574
Missed your eye. Doesn't need stitches.

670
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,659
Make a snow coat.

671
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,340
Peeta, get the snow. I'll grind the herbs.

672
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,831
What is that? That's hurting him.

673
00:40:58,832 --> 00:40:59,833
He needs morphling.

674
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:04,505
It's okay.

675
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,143
Mom. No. I'll do it.

676
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:20,646
Oh, God.

677
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:24,942
Hold him, please.

678
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,336
That's better.

679
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,400
Hey, Catnip.

680
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,735
Hey.

681
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,195
Thought you'd be gone by now.

682
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,197
I'm not going anywhere.

683
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,368
I'm gonna stay right here.
Cause all kinds of trouble.

684
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,539
Me, too.

685
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:46,065
Hey.

686
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,110
You wanna get some rest?

687
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,446
I can look after him for a while.

688
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,786
I'm gonna go get him more snow.

689
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:28,816
Hey.

690
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:30,943
How's your eye?

691
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:33,487
It's not my eye that's bothering me.

692
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:36,322
How can we live like this?

693
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,117
How can anybody live like this?

694
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,661
It's not living, but...

695
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:45,916
Since the last Games,
something is different.

696
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,501
I can see it.

697
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,671
What can you see?

698
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:53,590
Hope.

699
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:59,847
You understand that whatever
I do comes back to you and Mom.

700
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,641
I don't want you to get hurt.

701
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,353
You don't have to protect me. Or Mom.

702
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,815
We're with you.

703
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,284
I love you.

704
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,286
I love you, too.

705
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:26,165
The broadcast cut out here.

706
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,792
Before any of the excitement happened.

707
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,378
How many people saw it?

708
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:33,380
Hard to say. There was a five second delay,

709
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,382
but it happened fast.

710
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:38,844
If you cannot contain Katniss Everdeen,

711
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,722
then I will have to terminate her.

712
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,140
I understand that.

713
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,933
And not just her.

714
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:51,398
Her entire species has to be eliminated.

715
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:52,608
Her species, sir?

716
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,693
The other Victors.

717
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:58,405
Now, because of her,
they all pose a threat.

718
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:00,908
Because of her,

719
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:03,327
they all think they're invincible.

720
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,663
Whatever game you think you're playing,

721
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,501
those out there are not
playing it with you.

722
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:13,921
There's a way we can still win.

723
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:19,676
It's what we Gamemakers
like to call "a wrinkle."

724
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,394
Ladies and gentlemen,

725
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:34,525
this is the 75th year of The Hunger Games.

726
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,612
<i>And it was written in the
charter of The Games</i>

727
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:43,075
<i>that every 25 years,
there would be a Quarter Quell</i>

728
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:46,954
<i>to keep fresh for each new generation</i>

729
00:45:47,204 --> 00:45:49,623
<i>the memory of those who died</i>

730
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:53,043
<i>in the uprising against The Capitol.</i>

731
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:55,754
<i>Each Quarter Quell is distinguished</i>

732
00:45:55,963 --> 00:45:59,299
<i>by Games of a special significance.</i>

733
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,635
<i>And now on this,</i>

734
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:05,556
the 75th anniversary of our
defeat of the rebellion,

735
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,392
we celebrate the 3rd Quarter Quell

736
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:16,441
as a reminder that even the strongest

737
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:21,154
<i>cannot overcome the power of The Capitol.</i>

738
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:25,993
<i>On this, the 3rd Quarter Quell Games,</i>

739
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,289
<i>the male and female Tributes</i>

740
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,499
<i>are to be reaped</i>

741
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:37,086
<i>from the existing pool
of Victors in each district.</i>

742
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,923
No!

743
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:41,508
Who does he mean?

744
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:44,636
<i>Victors shall present
themselves on Reaping Day</i>

745
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:47,513
<i>- regardless of age...</i>
- Katniss...

746
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,315
<i>...state of health</i>

747
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:50,767
<i>or situation.</i>

748
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:03,780
No.

749
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:20,505
Peeta.

750
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,682
Ah. There she is.

751
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:32,392
Finally did the math, huh?

752
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:34,895
And you've come to, what?

753
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,397
Ask me to... Die?

754
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:39,858
I'm here to drink.

755
00:47:40,317 --> 00:47:41,400
Oh.

756
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:42,986
Finally, something I can help you with.

757
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:49,242
What's it say that Peeta
was here 45 minutes ago

758
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:52,411
begging to save your life
and you only just now show up?

759
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:53,747
It means we have to save him.

760
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:57,917
You could live 100 lifetimes
and never deserve that boy.

761
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,418
Come on, Haymitch.

762
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:01,421
Nobody decent ever wins The Games.

763
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:04,049
Nobody ever wins The Games. Period.

764
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:07,928
There are survivors.

765
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:10,430
There's no winners.

766
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:12,516
Peeta has to survive.

767
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:17,061
We have to do whatever
it takes to save him.

768
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:20,774
All right, if...

769
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:26,071
If they call his name,
I'll volunteer in his place.

770
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:27,864
Haymitch, thank you.

771
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:31,117
But they call my name and Peeta volunteers,

772
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,786
there's nothing I can do.

773
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:37,957
You can help him in the arena.
Like you did for me.

774
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,208
Ah...

775
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:41,586
I think these Games are gonna be different.

776
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,132
I don't care. Do whatever you can.

777
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:47,968
Peeta lives. Not me.

778
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:51,138
Promise me.

779
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,725
Okay.

780
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:04,109
We should've gone when you said.

781
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:57,454
<i>Welcome.</i>

782
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:58,788
Welcome.

783
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:03,793
As we celebrate the 75th anniversary

784
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:06,463
and 3rd Quarter Quell

785
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:09,716
of The Hunger Games.

786
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:11,384
As always,

787
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,970
ladies first.

788
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:33,532
The female Tribute from District 12,

789
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:36,910
Katniss Everdeen.

790
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:50,006
Wonderful.

791
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:53,093
And now for the men.

792
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:07,440
The male Tribute from District 12.

793
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,944
Haymitch Abernathy.

794
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:12,278
I volunteer as Tribute.

795
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:13,280
I can't let you do that.

796
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:14,446
You can't stop me.

797
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,408
- Peeta.
- Let go.

798
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:22,956
Very well.

799
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:26,751
The Tributes from District 12.

800
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,129
Katniss Everdeen

801
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,382
and Peeta Mellark.

802
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,139
Well, all that remains is...

803
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,322
Oh, no. But, but, but...

804
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:57,407
Katniss!

805
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:59,325
- I get to say goodbye.
- Katniss!

806
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:00,606
New plan. Straight to the train.

807
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:02,328
No, I have to say goodbye.

808
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:03,330
Katniss!

809
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:04,581
No.

810
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:07,417
Goodbye!

811
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:23,016
All right.

812
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:26,853
Before we begin, I've had a thought.

813
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,104
You don't say?

814
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:32,525
Katniss has her gold Mockingjay pin.

815
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,527
I have my hair.

816
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:39,366
I'm going to get you two boys
something gold.

817
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,703
Uh... Why is that?

818
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:45,205
A token.

819
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:47,457
Show them we are a team.

820
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,376
And they can't just...

821
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:51,878
Thank you.

822
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,055
All right. Now...

823
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:07,811
Everything will be different,
because it's a Quarter Quell.

824
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:11,147
<i>The Capitol has spared no expense.</i>

825
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:12,732
<i>A new training center.</i>

826
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,067
<i>New Tribute living quarters.</i>

827
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:17,362
<i>And of course, a very special arena.</i>

828
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:19,571
<i>But this year you'll be
facing other Victors.</i>

829
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:20,573
<i>Capitol favorites.</i>

830
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:22,325
<i>Smart, cunning, skilled.</i>

831
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,077
<i>And they all know one another.</i>

832
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:26,705
<i>You two are the outsiders.</i>

833
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:28,414
I want you guys to forget

834
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:30,709
everything you think you know
about The Games.

835
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,002
Last year was child's play.

836
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:36,923
This year, you're dealing
with all experienced killers.

837
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:39,592
All right. What does that mean for us?

838
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,345
That means you're gonna have
to have some allies.

839
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,764
Okay. I think that if...

840
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,599
Whoop. You're not the problem.

841
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:47,851
No.

842
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:51,270
Look, you're starting at a disadvantage.

843
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,606
Most of these people
have been friends for years.

844
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:55,567
That just puts us higher
on their kill list.

845
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:58,695
Do it your own way, but
I know these people.

846
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,112
You go it alone,

847
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:03,074
their first move is gonna
be to hunt you down.

848
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:04,784
Both of you.

849
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:06,953
Katniss, come on.

850
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,127
How could any of us even trust each other?

851
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:18,047
It's not about trust.
It's about staying alive.

852
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,633
Cashmere and Gloss.

853
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:22,385
Brother and sister. District 1.

854
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:25,304
They won back-to-back Games.
Capitol favorites.

855
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:28,224
Lots of sponsors. They will be lethal.

856
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,226
And the other half of the Career Pack,

857
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:32,437
Brutus and Enobaria.

858
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:33,645
What's with her teeth?

859
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:36,900
She had them filed into fangs
so she could rip people's throats out.

860
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,318
She's committed. I'll give her that.

861
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:41,821
Wiress and Beetee. Not
fighters, but brilliant.

862
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:44,449
And weird. Real tech-savvy.

863
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,492
He won his Games by electrocuting

864
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:47,786
six Tributes at once.

865
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:50,330
The Morphlings. Masters of camouflage.

866
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,750
Basically, won their Games by
hiding until everyone else was dead.

867
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,419
Self-medicating ever since.
Which I applaud.

868
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:57,670
Not a threat.

869
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:00,298
Finnick Odair, right?

870
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:03,259
Yes. He won his Games at 14. Youngest ever.

871
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,428
- Extremely humble.
- You're kidding.

872
00:55:05,637 --> 00:55:08,180
Yes, I'm kidding. He's a peacock.

873
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:09,348
A total preener.

874
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:12,268
But he's The Capitol darling.
They love him here.

875
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:13,769
Charming, smart,

876
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,190
and very skilled at combat.
Especially in water.

877
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:18,566
What about weaknesses?

878
00:55:18,775 --> 00:55:19,859
One. Mags.

879
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:21,820
She volunteered for Annie.

880
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:24,864
Mags was his mentor
and basically raised him.

881
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:28,493
If he's trying to protect her in any way,
it exposes him.

882
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,453
A guy like that has to know
she's not gonna make it.

883
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:32,955
I bet when it really comes down to it,
he won't protect her.

884
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:35,750
Well, Katniss, I just hope when
she goes, she goes quickly.

885
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:39,003
She's actually a wonderful lady.

886
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,322
How'd we get here, huh?

887
00:56:06,865 --> 00:56:08,283
Katniss.

888
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,243
Hello, Finnick.

889
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,203
Do you want a sugar cube?

890
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,040
I mean, it's supposed to be
for the horses, but...

891
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:17,917
I mean, who cares about them, right?

892
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:20,253
They got years to eat sugar,
whereas you and I...

893
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,461
Well, if we see something sweet,
we better grab it.

894
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:26,759
No thanks. But I would love
to borrow that outfit someday.

895
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:29,387
You look pretty terrifying in that getup.

896
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:30,930
What happened to the
pretty little girl dresses?

897
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,472
I outgrew them.

898
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,474
You certainly did.

899
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,728
Shame about this Quell thing.

900
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:38,186
Now, you...

901
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,440
You could've made out
like a bandit in The Capitol.

902
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:42,734
Jewels, money, anything you wanted.

903
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:45,862
Well, I don't like jewels
and I have more money than I need, so...

904
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,830
What did you do
with all your wealth, anyway?

905
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,533
I haven't dealt in anything
as common as money in years.

906
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:53,453
Then how do people pay for
the pleasure of your company?

907
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:57,790
With secrets.

908
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:02,503
What about you, Girl on Fire?

909
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:05,006
Any secrets worth my time?

910
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,592
I'm an open book.

911
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:09,593
Everybody always seems to know my secrets

912
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:10,887
before I know them myself.

913
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,014
Unfortunately, I think that's true.

914
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:18,144
I'm sorry you had to cancel your wedding.

915
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:22,148
I know how devastating
that must be for you.

916
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:26,569
Have a good day.

917
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,740
- Peeta.
- Finnick.

918
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:33,867
What'd he want?

919
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,370
To know all my secrets.

920
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,497
Hmm. He'll have to get in line.

921
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:40,332
<i>Tributes, mount up.</i>

922
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,001
No waving and smiling, this time.

923
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,627
I want you to look straight ahead

924
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,922
as if the audience and this
whole event are beneath you.

925
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,633
That should be easy.

926
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:51,219
Press this when you're ready.

927
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:52,762
Good luck.

928
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,869
Here they come!

929
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,746
From District 12. Our favorites.

930
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,791
- Well...
- Or my favorite.

931
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,415
There it is!

932
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,624
Oh.

933
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,960
Fire in the house!

934
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:11,799
Katniss! Katniss! Katniss!

935
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,158
Nice. Way to make friends
out there, you two.

936
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:38,701
Well, we learned from the best.

937
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:41,370
I wanna introduce you to some
special friends of mine.

938
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,581
This is Seeder. And Chaff.

939
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:44,916
From District 11.

940
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,291
Uh...

941
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:49,669
He's very friendly.

942
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,508
Don't invite him over.
He'll drink up your liquor.

943
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,134
I'll see you guys soon.

944
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,177
Let's get some of that makeup off you

945
00:59:57,178 --> 00:59:58,763
and talk about these other Tributes.

946
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,099
These Tributes are crazy.

947
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,476
No, not all of 'em. He's a good guy.

948
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:05,894
Carry on.

949
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,236
You guys look amazing.

950
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:15,320
Thank you.

951
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:17,365
My stylist is such an idiot.

952
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:21,119
District 7. Lumber. Trees. Ugh!

953
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:24,831
I'd love to put my ax in her face.

954
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:27,250
So what do you think?

955
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,793
Now that the whole world
wants to sleep with you?

956
01:00:29,794 --> 01:00:31,128
I don't think
that the whole world...

957
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:32,380
I wasn't talking to you.

958
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:33,672
Okay.

959
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:34,674
Will you unzip?

960
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:36,676
Yeah.

961
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,037
Thanks. Let's do it again sometime.

962
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:06,789
Thank you.

963
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:10,751
Johanna Mason, District 7.

964
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:17,048
Remember, Katniss,
today's about making allies.

965
01:01:21,888 --> 01:01:24,557
So far I'm not overwhelmed by our choices.

966
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,894
I guess we just try
to figure out who we trust least

967
01:01:28,895 --> 01:01:31,354
and work our way backwards from there.

968
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,440
Friction generates heat.

969
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:17,276
Heat generates fire. In theory.

970
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,445
You should move your hands downward.

971
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:22,949
And faster, too.

972
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:36,587
- A little brute force...
- Is always helpful.

973
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:39,631
Thank you.

974
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:41,592
By the corner of the table.

975
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:43,719
Plutarch?

976
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,722
No. Next to him.

977
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:49,100
Force field.

978
01:02:49,225 --> 01:02:50,309
How do you know?

979
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:51,644
The shimmering.

980
01:02:54,397 --> 01:02:55,898
Top left hand side.

981
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:57,775
Look.

982
01:02:58,734 --> 01:02:59,777
There.

983
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:01,946
You see it?

984
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:04,991
Looks like glass.

985
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:07,159
To separate us and them.

986
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:08,994
Probably my fault.

987
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:10,663
I shot an arrow at them last year.

988
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:12,330
Uh-huh... Electromagnetic.

989
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:13,415
How can you tell?

990
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:17,168
Is it... Is it obvious or something?

991
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:20,506
"Is it obvious?"

992
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,591
They might as well have a sign.

993
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,635
Look around you.

994
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,512
All the holograms, the lights,

995
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,347
every now and then they flicker. Why?

996
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:31,309
Because the force field
is taking up too much energy.

997
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:34,520
There's always a flaw in the system.

998
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:47,533
That's beautiful.

999
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,661
I saw you volunteer for that young girl.

1000
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:53,289
It was really brave.

1001
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:03,299
Prim is my sister.

1002
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:07,720
If you, um...

1003
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:11,508
If you teach me how to make a fishhook like
that I could teach you how to hunt.

1004
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:15,186
Yes, yes.

1005
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,259
<i>Do you wanna try with me?</i>

1006
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:22,734
Okay.

1007
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:23,903
I'll go first.

1008
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,301
<i>Good news.</i>

1009
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:33,597
At least half the Tributes
want you as an ally.

1010
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:35,266
Well, they saw her shoot.

1011
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:38,102
Well, sweetheart,
you got your pick of the litter.

1012
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,645
I want Wiress and Beetee.

1013
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:41,647
Johanna calls them "Nuts" and "Volts."

1014
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:43,898
Well, okay, good. Now, who else?

1015
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:44,900
Mags.

1016
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:48,237
All right, fine, then no one.

1017
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:52,658
I'll tell them you're still
making up your mind.

1018
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:11,797
<i>District 3.
Beetee Latter.</i>

1019
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:14,805
<i>Report for individual assessment.</i>

1020
01:06:26,484 --> 01:06:29,028
Peeta, how are we gonna kill these people?

1021
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:38,412
<i>District 12.
Katniss Everdeen.</i>

1022
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:41,165
<i>Report for individual assessment.</i>

1023
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:17,368
Miss Everdeen.

1024
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,206
Miss Everdeen!

1025
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,711
You have 10 minutes
to present your chosen skill.

1026
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:27,104
Thank you! Thank you!

1027
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:29,523
Thank you for being here tonight

1028
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:35,112
on the eve of the 75th Hunger Games!

1029
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,785
We have never seen anything like this.

1030
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:45,122
And we will never see
anything like it again.

1031
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:48,876
Because tonight, on this stage,

1032
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:52,755
24 of Panem's brightest stars

1033
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:56,467
will vie for the ultimate crown.

1034
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:59,302
Tonight will be their final opportunity

1035
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:00,929
to express their thoughts.

1036
01:09:01,597 --> 01:09:05,184
Our final opportunity to express our love.

1037
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:07,311
And heartbreakingly

1038
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:14,400
to say goodbye to all but one.

1039
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,322
What a night.

1040
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:21,949
Let's hear it.

1041
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:25,328
It's so exciting!

1042
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:29,041
A wedding dress?

1043
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:33,128
President Snow insisted,
but I made a few alterations.

1044
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:36,799
<i>You two made The Games
a family affair.</i>

1045
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:39,760
You became everyone's brother and sister.

1046
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:42,805
I don't know how we're going to let you go.

1047
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,515
We're not going by choice.

1048
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:48,519
You are our family.

1049
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:51,271
And I don't see how anyone
can love us better.

1050
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,733
So sweet. So sweet.

1051
01:09:54,881 --> 01:09:56,442
Are you all right, dear?

1052
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:57,820
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1053
01:09:58,028 --> 01:09:59,363
<i>I just can't stop crying.</i>

1054
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,032
God! Does anybody actually believe this?

1055
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,410
Apparently, everybody.

1056
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,164
She is very good.

1057
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:11,166
These Victors are angry, Katniss.

1058
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,836
They'll say anything
to try and stop The Games.

1059
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:16,296
I suggest you do the same.

1060
01:10:17,256 --> 01:10:18,257
Beetee...

1061
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:22,594
You have contributed so much
to Panem over the years.

1062
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:25,597
I don't know who we will miss more.

1063
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:27,598
You or your brain.

1064
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:32,061
If the Quarter Quell
were written into law by men,

1065
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:34,273
certainly, it can be unwritten.

1066
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,901
Yes. Interesting concept.

1067
01:10:38,444 --> 01:10:40,738
Finnick...

1068
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:43,699
I understand that you have a message

1069
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:47,661
for somebody out there. A special somebody.

1070
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:51,081
Can we hear it?

1071
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,417
My love,

1072
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:55,711
you have my heart

1073
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:58,088
for all eternity

1074
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:00,799
and if...

1075
01:11:01,759 --> 01:11:03,802
If I die in that arena,

1076
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,264
my last thought will be of your lips.

1077
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,769
We have seen a lot of tears here tonight.

1078
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,146
But I see no tears in Johanna's eyes.

1079
01:11:14,313 --> 01:11:16,063
Johanna, you are angry.

1080
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:17,482
Tell me why.

1081
01:11:17,483 --> 01:11:19,610
Well, yes, I'm angry.

1082
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:21,903
You know,
I'm getting totally screwed over here.

1083
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:24,155
- Uh-huh. - The deal was that
if I win the Hunger Games,

1084
01:11:24,156 --> 01:11:26,908
I get to live the rest of my life in peace.

1085
01:11:26,909 --> 01:11:29,494
- Mmm-hmm.
- But now you want to kill me again.

1086
01:11:30,913 --> 01:11:32,079
Well, you know what?

1087
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,414
That!

1088
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:36,752
And everybody that had
anything to do with it!

1089
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,086
All right then.

1090
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,796
One woman's opinion.

1091
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:42,132
Who's next?

1092
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:43,509
All right, turn around.

1093
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:46,929
<i>I know
it's a bad break for everyone involved</i>

1094
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,431
I think I'm done.

1095
01:11:49,932 --> 01:11:51,266
Will I be twirling tonight?

1096
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,684
Save it for the end.

1097
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:55,646
One minute. Is she ready?

1098
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,443
Oh, Katniss.

1099
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:03,987
Oh...

1100
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:08,158
You would have been
the most beautiful bride.

1101
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:10,494
Thank you.

1102
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:12,871
Let's go show them

1103
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,833
what real beauty looks like.

1104
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:17,876
It has to go more up.

1105
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,670
Oh, pretty, pretty,
Katniss, they're going to adore you.

1106
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:23,215
And there are a lot of
sponsors in the audience,

1107
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:26,301
so of course, just be your usual self.

1108
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,053
Actually, be your happier self.

1109
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:30,722
Really? A wedding dress?

1110
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,474
Snow made me wear it.

1111
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:37,396
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...</i>

1112
01:12:37,646 --> 01:12:39,231
<i>- You know her...</i>
- Make him pay for it.

1113
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:40,399
<i>...as the Girl on Fire.</i>

1114
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:43,235
<i>The Victor of last year's Hunger Games.</i>

1115
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:45,903
<i>Katniss Everdeen!</i>

1116
01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:01,211
Katniss Everdeen,

1117
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,673
you look fabulous. Doesn't she?

1118
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:11,012
My, my!

1119
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:12,431
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

1120
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,099
Now, Katniss,

1121
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:16,602
this is

1122
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:22,524
a very big and very emotional night

1123
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:25,694
for all of us. Wouldn't you say?

1124
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:28,113
Oh, don't go crying on me now, Caesar.

1125
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:29,948
I can't make any promises. You know me.

1126
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:32,618
You know I wouldn't
believe you, even if you did.

1127
01:13:32,743 --> 01:13:35,202
I love her!
The Girl on Fire is so cheeky.

1128
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:38,290
But, Katniss,

1129
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,918
on a more serious note

1130
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,463
I think we're all here
a little disappointed,

1131
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:46,965
more than a little disappointed,

1132
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:50,469
that a certain wedding did not take place.

1133
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:53,387
Aren't we, folks?

1134
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:54,640
Aw...

1135
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:58,644
Alas. But am I correct in assuming

1136
01:13:58,894 --> 01:14:02,606
that this is the gown
that you would have worn

1137
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:04,608
on that day, yes or no?

1138
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:08,779
Yes, President Snow thought
everyone would want to see it.

1139
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:12,324
President Snow, as usual, was right.

1140
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:14,159
Was he not, folks?

1141
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:16,327
I love it! I love it!

1142
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:17,329
Don't you love it, folks?

1143
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:18,997
It's incredible. It's so gorgeous.

1144
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:22,416
Will you do us the honor?
Please? Please? Please?

1145
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:36,598
Oh, my God!

1146
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:40,602
Oh, my!

1147
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:49,694
It's a bird.

1148
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:54,031
It's got feathers.
It's like a bird.

1149
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:55,200
It's like a, um...

1150
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:56,535
Like a Mockingjay.

1151
01:14:57,703 --> 01:15:00,205
Your stylist certainly has
outdone himself this time,

1152
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:03,040
<i>hasn't he? What theatricality!</i>

1153
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,042
<i>Cinna!</i>

1154
01:15:05,127 --> 01:15:06,211
<i>Take a bow.</i>

1155
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:15,554
But, Peeta,

1156
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:20,892
the wedding, the marriage, never to be?

1157
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:23,561
Well, actually, we got married.

1158
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:25,230
In secret.

1159
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:28,025
A secret wedding?

1160
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:29,651
All right. Do tell.

1161
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:32,236
We... We want our love to be eternal.

1162
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:33,404
Of course.

1163
01:15:33,405 --> 01:15:34,823
You know, Katniss and I,

1164
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,742
we've been luckier than most.

1165
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,869
And I wouldn't have any regrets at all

1166
01:15:40,996 --> 01:15:43,081
if it weren't...

1167
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,376
If...

1168
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:50,921
If it weren't for what? What?

1169
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:54,092
If it weren't for the baby.

1170
01:15:56,011 --> 01:15:58,846
All right.
This is news! Let's find out more.

1171
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:03,685
Calm down. This is news to all of us.

1172
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:04,934
Call off The Games!

1173
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:06,854
All right.

1174
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:11,942
- Let's, uh...
- Stop The Games!

1175
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:13,278
Everybody, calm down.

1176
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:16,615
It's a great night. A great night.

1177
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,455
This is news to all of us.

1178
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:27,542
All right, all right, all right.

1179
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:30,795
We're going to find out
what we do about this.

1180
01:16:34,925 --> 01:16:36,384
Cancel The Games!

1181
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:39,137
Stop The Games!

1182
01:16:50,107 --> 01:16:52,484
There's no way they'll cancel. They can't.

1183
01:16:56,738 --> 01:16:58,990
Baby bomb was a stroke of genius.

1184
01:16:59,241 --> 01:17:02,160
Unfortunately, Games are still on.

1185
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:04,329
This is goodbye, for now.

1186
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,792
Presents for the boys.

1187
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:10,669
What is this?

1188
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:14,589
Your token. Remember?

1189
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:16,800
Hair for me. Pin for Katniss.

1190
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,301
Gold bangle for you.

1191
01:17:19,094 --> 01:17:22,305
And for Peeta, the medallion
that we talked about.

1192
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:25,475
Thank you, Effie.

1193
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:29,688
We're a team. Aren't we?

1194
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:35,610
And I'm so proud of my Victors.

1195
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,822
So proud.

1196
01:17:41,283 --> 01:17:42,450
You're so...

1197
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:51,209
Well, you both deserved so much better.

1198
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,795
Thank you, Effie.

1199
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:56,798
I am truly sorry.

1200
01:18:03,513 --> 01:18:04,681
Thank you, Haymitch.

1201
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:07,392
For everything.

1202
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:11,021
Any last advice?

1203
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:14,816
Stay alive.

1204
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:18,361
Haymitch, wait.

1205
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:23,074
Remember our deal.

1206
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,454
Do whatever it takes to keep him alive.

1207
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:29,414
Promise me.

1208
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:30,874
Okay.

1209
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:35,212
Katniss, when you're in the arena,

1210
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:37,923
remember who the real enemy is.

1211
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:50,393
I don't want to be with
anyone else in there.

1212
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:52,771
Just you.

1213
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:00,779
If that's what you want.

1214
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,948
That's what I want.

1215
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:11,456
I'll see you soon.

1216
01:19:37,315 --> 01:19:38,775
Your tracker.

1217
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:09,889
Look at this. They're holding hands.

1218
01:20:10,265 --> 01:20:11,975
I want them dead.

1219
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:14,686
Be patient.

1220
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:16,937
They're holding hands now,

1221
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:19,607
but the minute the gun goes off,
it'll be a bloodbath.

1222
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:24,737
And the whole idea
of revolution will be discredited.

1223
01:20:24,738 --> 01:20:26,448
And the idea of her?

1224
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:29,117
The idea of the Mockingjay?

1225
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:31,077
The more allies she betrays,

1226
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,414
the more friends she kills,

1227
01:20:35,457 --> 01:20:36,857
the more she reveals her true self.

1228
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:40,044
As long as it ends with
her picture in the sky

1229
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:41,254
and the sound of cannon.

1230
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:42,714
And it shall.

1231
01:20:42,881 --> 01:20:43,923
It better.

1232
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:47,010
Let's watch her get her hands dirty first.

1233
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:48,887
Hmm.

1234
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:50,680
Excuse me.

1235
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:03,860
Let's start.

1236
01:21:09,783 --> 01:21:12,118
This suit is light. No thermal.

1237
01:21:12,327 --> 01:21:14,162
So I'd guess tropics or desert.

1238
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:17,624
<i>Sixty seconds to launch.</i>

1239
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:21,002
That dress was beautiful.

1240
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:24,714
I think it was the best
one you've ever made.

1241
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:27,258
I thought you'd like it.

1242
01:21:27,518 --> 01:21:29,343
I just wanted to tell
you, because I don't...

1243
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,387
Stop.

1244
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:34,474
Remember, I'm still betting on you,
Girl on Fire.

1245
01:21:51,491 --> 01:21:53,743
Ten seconds to launch.

1246
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:18,475
No!

1247
01:22:18,476 --> 01:22:20,270
Cinna! No!

1248
01:22:23,565 --> 01:22:25,525
No! No! No!

1249
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:27,777
No! Cinna!

1250
01:22:27,986 --> 01:22:31,698
No! No! No!

1251
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:33,908
No!

1252
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:39,163
No, no...

1253
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:03,354
<i>Let the 75th
Hunger Games begin.</i>

1254
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:06,983
<i>May the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

1255
01:23:07,192 --> 01:23:08,317
Peeta?

1256
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:15,825
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

1257
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:18,369
<i>seven, six,</i>

1258
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:21,247
<i>five, four,</i>

1259
01:23:21,706 --> 01:23:24,292
<i>three, two,</i>

1260
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:25,668
<i>one.</i>

1261
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:11,631
Good thing we're allies, right?

1262
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:13,758
Where did you get that?

1263
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:14,968
Where do you think?

1264
01:24:16,219 --> 01:24:17,220
Duck.

1265
01:24:20,932 --> 01:24:22,058
Don't trust 1 and 2.

1266
01:24:22,392 --> 01:24:23,953
I'll take this side. You hold them off.

1267
01:24:24,269 --> 01:24:25,478
I'll go find Peeta.

1268
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,109
Katniss, Mags found him. He's over here.

1269
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:27,123
Katniss, Katniss, go, go, go.

1270
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:48,227
Okay, hold up. Hold up.

1271
01:25:50,063 --> 01:25:51,147
Here you go.

1272
01:25:51,648 --> 01:25:53,358
Okay. You all right now?

1273
01:25:55,485 --> 01:25:56,527
Okay?

1274
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:02,784
God, it's hot.

1275
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:04,535
We gotta find fresh water.

1276
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:18,131
Well, I guess we're not
holding hands any more.

1277
01:26:19,634 --> 01:26:20,885
You think that's funny?

1278
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:24,555
Every time that cannon goes off,
it's music to my ears.

1279
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:26,724
I don't care about any of them.

1280
01:26:27,642 --> 01:26:29,102
Good to hear.

1281
01:26:29,811 --> 01:26:31,813
Want to face the Career Pack alone?

1282
01:26:33,147 --> 01:26:34,232
What would Haymitch say?

1283
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:35,733
Haymitch isn't here.

1284
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:38,319
Let's keep moving.

1285
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:23,948
Peeta, no!

1286
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:31,497
Peeta?

1287
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,125
Peeta?

1288
01:27:34,459 --> 01:27:36,627
He's not breathing. He's not breathing.

1289
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:38,337
He's not breathing! Peeta!

1290
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:45,678
Peeta?

1291
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:47,346
Peeta?

1292
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:49,890
Come on! Come on!

1293
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:50,892
Please, wake up.

1294
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:52,518
No.

1295
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,481
Please, wake up.

1296
01:27:57,023 --> 01:27:58,649
- Come on.
- Come on!

1297
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,818
Bring me in closer.

1298
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,074
Cannon ready?

1299
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:14,749
Come on. Come on. Come on, Peeta!

1300
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:17,084
Please, Peeta. Peeta.

1301
01:28:21,172 --> 01:28:22,340
Come on.

1302
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,760
Peeta? Peeta.

1303
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:32,016
Oh, my God.

1304
01:28:32,225 --> 01:28:33,945
Be careful. There's a force field up there.

1305
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:40,525
Oh, my God. You were dead.

1306
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:43,736
You were dead. Your heart stopped.

1307
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:45,196
It's okay.

1308
01:28:45,863 --> 01:28:47,365
It's working now.

1309
01:28:50,785 --> 01:28:52,410
You... Do you wanna stand up?

1310
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:53,412
Yeah.

1311
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:04,590
It's okay.

1312
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,976
Someday I want to love someone that much.

1313
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:19,230
And so you shall, my darling. So you shall.

1314
01:29:41,252 --> 01:29:42,295
Hang on.

1315
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:40,811
<i>The force field...</i>

1316
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:43,147
It's a dome. We're at
the edge of the arena.

1317
01:30:43,564 --> 01:30:45,566
We couldn't find any signs of fresh water.

1318
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:48,819
It's gonna get dark soon.

1319
01:30:49,153 --> 01:30:51,593
We'll be safe with our backs protected.
We should set up camp.

1320
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:54,325
Take turns sleeping. I
can take first watch.

1321
01:30:54,742 --> 01:30:55,743
Not a chance.

1322
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,539
Honey, that thing I did
back there for Peeta?

1323
01:31:00,697 --> 01:31:02,082
That was called "saving his life."

1324
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:05,836
If I wanted to kill either of you,
I would've done it by now.

1325
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:12,168
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll take the first watch.

1326
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:16,555
Just for a little bit.

1327
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:34,949
How's Peeta?

1328
01:31:37,451 --> 01:31:40,286
He's okay, I think.

1329
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:42,790
Just dehydrated like the rest of us.

1330
01:32:15,656 --> 01:32:16,741
Eight.

1331
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:19,493
Mmm-hmm.

1332
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,421
Hey.

1333
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:39,847
Drink up?

1334
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:41,348
What is it?

1335
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:42,767
It's from Haymitch.

1336
01:32:45,102 --> 01:32:46,353
I think it's a spile.

1337
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:47,646
A What?

1338
01:33:03,329 --> 01:33:05,956
You're kidding me.
You're kidding me.

1339
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:07,666
Get some water.

1340
01:33:17,468 --> 01:33:18,803
I'm gonna get a leaf.

1341
01:33:24,141 --> 01:33:25,726
I'll get some for Mags.

1342
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:27,228
There we go.

1343
01:33:35,319 --> 01:33:36,403
Want some more?

1344
01:34:08,352 --> 01:34:09,687
I counted 12.

1345
01:34:11,522 --> 01:34:12,523
Midnight?

1346
01:34:13,065 --> 01:34:14,400
Or the number of districts.

1347
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:32,251
Well...

1348
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:36,213
If you're not gonna sleep, I will.

1349
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,424
Okay.

1350
01:35:58,045 --> 01:36:01,465
Run! Run! The fog is poison!

1351
01:36:02,299 --> 01:36:03,676
Come on, come on, come on

1352
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:07,137
There!

1353
01:37:11,243 --> 01:37:13,202
God! Ah, God!

1354
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:18,125
Mags, please, please! Come on! Come on!

1355
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:21,628
Peeta.

1356
01:37:28,469 --> 01:37:29,636
I can't carry him.

1357
01:37:30,554 --> 01:37:31,764
Peeta, please.

1358
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:34,892
Peeta, please, stand up. We have to go.

1359
01:37:36,602 --> 01:37:37,644
Mags?

1360
01:37:38,228 --> 01:37:40,146
- Mags? Mags!
- Finnick.

1361
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:41,440
- Mags!
- Finnick.

1362
01:37:42,066 --> 01:37:43,274
- Mags!
- Finnick!

1363
01:37:44,485 --> 01:37:45,610
Finnick, we have to go.

1364
01:37:45,611 --> 01:37:47,237
We have to get outta here.

1365
01:37:49,156 --> 01:37:50,574
We have to go.

1366
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:54,453
All right, come on, come on.

1367
01:37:54,745 --> 01:37:55,746
Okay.

1368
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:10,344
Shit!

1369
01:39:45,606 --> 01:39:49,067
The water! The water helps.

1370
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:38,909
We need our weapons.

1371
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:08,355
I'm sorry about Mags.

1372
01:41:15,654 --> 01:41:17,447
She was never gonna make it.

1373
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,701
So...

1374
01:41:39,052 --> 01:41:40,053
<i>What?</i>

1375
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:06,246
- Peeta.
- Yeah?

1376
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:08,832
Walk over here slowly.

1377
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:16,506
Whoa.

1378
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:42,616
Get to the beach.

1379
01:43:52,686 --> 01:43:54,980
We gotta get to the beach!

1380
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:19,336
Who is that?

1381
01:44:19,337 --> 01:44:21,298
A Morphling! Help me get her!

1382
01:44:47,032 --> 01:44:48,157
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

1383
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:49,326
It's okay. Shh!

1384
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:57,042
Hey, you wanna see something?
Look up. Look.

1385
01:44:58,502 --> 01:45:00,754
Look at it. Look at that.

1386
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:03,173
It's incredible, isn't it?

1387
01:45:03,757 --> 01:45:05,175
All those colors.

1388
01:45:06,259 --> 01:45:08,553
Don't worry about anything else.

1389
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:10,300
I'll be right here with you.

1390
01:45:11,223 --> 01:45:13,517
It's okay. It's okay.

1391
01:46:12,742 --> 01:46:16,580
She sacrificed herself for me
and I didn't even know her name.

1392
01:46:18,248 --> 01:46:20,500
You think she sacrificed herself?

1393
01:46:22,669 --> 01:46:23,920
Looked like it.

1394
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,633
That doesn't make any sense.

1395
01:46:56,453 --> 01:46:58,455
Look. For you.

1396
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:04,669
Thank you.

1397
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,303
That's new.

1398
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:08,066
Someone's here.

1399
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:18,076
Johanna?

1400
01:48:19,536 --> 01:48:20,704
Johanna!

1401
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:21,871
Finnick!

1402
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:29,045
Guess we have more allies.

1403
01:48:38,888 --> 01:48:40,515
Well...

1404
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,058
I got 'em out.

1405
01:48:42,434 --> 01:48:44,643
We were all the way deep into the jungle

1406
01:48:44,644 --> 01:48:46,396
where I thought it was gonna be safe.

1407
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:49,107
That's when the rain started.

1408
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,776
I thought it was water.

1409
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:53,903
It turned out to be blood.

1410
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:57,239
- Tick took.
- Hot, thick blood.

1411
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,616
- It was coming down.
- Tick took.

1412
01:48:58,783 --> 01:49:00,242
It was choking us.

1413
01:49:00,243 --> 01:49:02,954
We were stumbling around,
gagging on it, blind.

1414
01:49:03,163 --> 01:49:04,246
Tick tock.

1415
01:49:04,247 --> 01:49:06,458
That's when Blight hit the force field.

1416
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:08,959
Tick took. Tick took.

1417
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,336
He wasn't much, but he was from home.

1418
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:12,630
Tick took.

1419
01:49:14,299 --> 01:49:15,425
Tick took.

1420
01:49:16,226 --> 01:49:18,010
- Tick took.
- What's wrong with her?

1421
01:49:18,011 --> 01:49:19,636
- She's in shock.
- Tick took.

1422
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:22,515
Dehydration isn't helping.
Do you have fresh water?

1423
01:49:22,766 --> 01:49:23,847
- We can get some.
- Just...

1424
01:49:23,933 --> 01:49:25,100
Tick took.

1425
01:49:25,101 --> 01:49:27,270
Listen. Stop it!

1426
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:29,022
- Hey! Lay off her!
- Just sit down!

1427
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:31,941
Hey! What are you doing?

1428
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:34,444
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I got them out for you!

1429
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:35,852
It's okay. It's okay.

1430
01:49:36,112 --> 01:49:37,279
Let me go, Finnick!

1431
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,530
For me? What does that mean?

1432
01:49:38,531 --> 01:49:39,615
Let me go.

1433
01:49:39,616 --> 01:49:41,616
- You did want them as allies.
- I'm fine.

1434
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:48,958
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

1435
01:49:50,877 --> 01:49:51,960
Tick took.

1436
01:49:51,961 --> 01:49:53,629
- Tick took.
- Tick took!

1437
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:54,631
Tick took, okay.

1438
01:50:07,473 --> 01:50:08,977
What does Beetee have there?

1439
01:50:08,978 --> 01:50:11,397
The coil? It's some kind of wire.

1440
01:50:13,483 --> 01:50:15,860
Did he get it from the Cornucopia?

1441
01:50:16,486 --> 01:50:18,153
Took a knife in the back to get it.

1442
01:50:19,405 --> 01:50:21,206
- Tick took! Tick took!
- All right.

1443
01:50:21,574 --> 01:50:22,742
I can't.

1444
01:50:23,034 --> 01:50:24,828
Just... Have fun with "Nuts."

1445
01:50:35,421 --> 01:50:36,506
Tick took.

1446
01:50:36,714 --> 01:50:37,924
Tick took.

1447
01:50:39,342 --> 01:50:40,677
It's a clock.

1448
01:50:42,345 --> 01:50:43,513
It's a clock.

1449
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:46,390
My God, it's a clock!
Wiress, you're a genius.

1450
01:50:46,391 --> 01:50:47,433
You're a genius!

1451
01:50:55,859 --> 01:50:58,611
<i>This entire arena
seems to be laid out like a clock</i>

1452
01:50:58,862 --> 01:51:00,405
<i>with a new threat every hour,</i>

1453
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:02,574
<i>but they stay only within their wedge.</i>

1454
01:51:02,866 --> 01:51:04,242
<i>It all starts with the lightning.</i>

1455
01:51:04,701 --> 01:51:06,535
Then the blood rain, fog, monkeys.

1456
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:07,871
That's the first four hours.

1457
01:51:08,037 --> 01:51:10,206
At 10:00, that big wave
hits from over there.

1458
01:51:10,415 --> 01:51:12,125
Wiress, you're a genius.

1459
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:14,210
Look, the tail points to 12.

1460
01:51:14,711 --> 01:51:16,912
That's where the lightning
strikes at noon and midnight.

1461
01:51:17,088 --> 01:51:18,131
Strikes where?

1462
01:51:18,381 --> 01:51:19,382
That big tree.

1463
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:24,219
Good.

1464
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:28,057
"Hickory dickory dock.
The mouse ran up the clock."

1465
01:51:28,391 --> 01:51:30,810
"The clock struck one, the mouse ran down."

1466
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,604
"Hickory dickory dock."

1467
01:51:36,274 --> 01:51:38,401
So 12:00 to 1:00, lightning.

1468
01:51:38,568 --> 01:51:40,236
Then 1:00 to 2:00 is blood.

1469
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:42,739
Then fog. And then monkeys.

1470
01:51:43,072 --> 01:51:46,909
"Hickory dickory dock.
The dog barked at the clock."

1471
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:48,118
"The clock struck 3:00..."

1472
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:49,480
And then 10:00 to 11:00, the wave.

1473
01:51:49,579 --> 01:51:51,455
What about everything else?
Did you guys see anything?

1474
01:51:51,456 --> 01:51:52,581
"Hickory dickory dock."

1475
01:51:52,582 --> 01:51:54,499
- Nothing but blood.
- It doesn't matter.

1476
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,128
As long as we steer clear of whichever
sector is active, we'll be safe.

1477
01:51:57,253 --> 01:51:58,795
Yeah. Relatively speaking.

1478
01:52:27,492 --> 01:52:28,826
Change it up. Spin it.

1479
01:52:37,293 --> 01:52:38,294
Come on! Come on!

1480
01:52:57,897 --> 01:52:58,898
Hold on!

1481
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:17,000
No!

1482
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:20,878
Okay. That's enough.

1483
01:53:22,338 --> 01:53:23,840
Let's see how they tell time now.

1484
01:53:47,447 --> 01:53:48,448
You okay?

1485
01:53:51,367 --> 01:53:55,413
Let's just get what we
need and get off the bloody island.

1486
01:54:03,379 --> 01:54:05,757
So besides Brutus and Enobaria, who's left?

1487
01:54:05,965 --> 01:54:07,716
Maybe Chaff. Just those three.

1488
01:54:07,717 --> 01:54:10,094
They know they're outnumbered.
I doubt they'll attack again.

1489
01:54:10,303 --> 01:54:11,763
We're safe here on the beach.

1490
01:54:11,971 --> 01:54:13,371
So what do we do? We hunt 'em down?

1491
01:54:15,224 --> 01:54:16,726
Katniss, help me!

1492
01:54:17,101 --> 01:54:18,102
Prim!

1493
01:54:18,227 --> 01:54:19,937
- Prim! Prim!
- No!

1494
01:54:20,146 --> 01:54:21,731
Katniss! Katniss, wait!

1495
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:24,399
Prim! Prim!

1496
01:54:26,402 --> 01:54:27,445
Prim!

1497
01:54:27,904 --> 01:54:28,987
Prim!

1498
01:54:28,988 --> 01:54:30,156
Katniss!

1499
01:54:32,075 --> 01:54:34,744
Help me! Help me!

1500
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:39,749
Katniss!

1501
01:54:42,919 --> 01:54:44,002
You okay?

1502
01:54:44,003 --> 01:54:45,254
Finnick!

1503
01:54:45,421 --> 01:54:46,505
Finnick!

1504
01:54:46,506 --> 01:54:47,965
- No! It's not her.
- Annie!

1505
01:54:48,925 --> 01:54:50,008
Annie!

1506
01:54:50,009 --> 01:54:53,096
- Annie! Annie!
- Finnick! It's not her.

1507
01:54:53,215 --> 01:54:54,679
It's just a jabberjay. It's not her.

1508
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,972
Well, how do you think they got that sound?

1509
01:54:55,973 --> 01:54:57,307
Jabberjays copy.

1510
01:54:57,308 --> 01:54:58,475
Katniss!

1511
01:54:58,476 --> 01:54:59,477
Gale.

1512
01:55:03,106 --> 01:55:04,690
Come on, come on, come on!

1513
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:23,501
Peeta!

1514
01:55:24,961 --> 01:55:27,171
Stop, stop, stop! It's okay!

1515
01:55:29,549 --> 01:55:31,884
It's okay! They're just mutts!
It's not real!

1516
01:55:43,855 --> 01:55:45,814
It's over. It's okay. They're gone.

1517
01:55:45,815 --> 01:55:47,816
The hour's gone. The hour's up.
It's all right.

1518
01:55:48,901 --> 01:55:51,028
- Prim! Find Prim!
- No, no. Prim's okay.

1519
01:55:51,237 --> 01:55:52,320
Are you okay?

1520
01:55:52,321 --> 01:55:54,031
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1521
01:55:54,699 --> 01:55:57,243
Okay? They won't touch Prim. All right?

1522
01:55:59,412 --> 01:56:02,012
Your fiancé's right.
The whole country loves your sister.

1523
01:56:02,665 --> 01:56:04,875
If they tortured her or
did anything to her,

1524
01:56:04,876 --> 01:56:05,877
forget the districts,

1525
01:56:06,002 --> 01:56:09,839
there would be riots in the damn Capitol.

1526
01:56:13,593 --> 01:56:15,344
Hey, how does that sound, Snow?

1527
01:56:15,553 --> 01:56:19,182
What if we...
What if we set your backyard on fire?

1528
01:56:20,016 --> 01:56:23,769
You know, you can't put everybody in here.

1529
01:56:29,192 --> 01:56:30,193
What?

1530
01:56:31,736 --> 01:56:33,196
They can't hurt me.

1531
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:35,698
There's no one left that I love.

1532
01:56:39,535 --> 01:56:41,037
I'll get you some water.

1533
01:57:07,813 --> 01:57:08,940
Thank you.

1534
01:57:20,993 --> 01:57:22,078
Who's Annie?

1535
01:57:26,749 --> 01:57:29,585
Annie Cresta. The girl
Mags volunteered for.

1536
01:57:31,337 --> 01:57:35,091
She won, like, four years...
Five years ago.

1537
01:57:36,676 --> 01:57:38,511
Is she the one that went a little...

1538
01:57:39,428 --> 01:57:40,596
Mmm-hmm.

1539
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:50,690
Love is weird.

1540
01:57:55,278 --> 01:57:57,113
I have a plan.

1541
01:58:00,783 --> 01:58:02,368
Finnick!

1542
01:58:02,535 --> 01:58:04,120
I have a plan.

1543
01:58:08,291 --> 01:58:10,459
Where do the Careers feel safest?
The jungle?

1544
01:58:10,668 --> 01:58:12,044
The jungle's a nightmare.

1545
01:58:12,628 --> 01:58:14,379
Probably here on the beach.

1546
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,548
Then why are they not here?

1547
01:58:15,798 --> 01:58:17,675
Because we are. We claimed it.

1548
01:58:18,009 --> 01:58:19,552
And if we left, they would come.

1549
01:58:19,802 --> 01:58:21,512
Or stay hidden in the tree line.

1550
01:58:21,804 --> 01:58:23,514
Which in just over four hours

1551
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:25,891
will be soaked with water
from the 10:00 wave.

1552
01:58:26,475 --> 01:58:27,726
And what happens at midnight?

1553
01:58:27,727 --> 01:58:29,020
Lightning strikes that tree.

1554
01:58:29,145 --> 01:58:30,313
Here's what I propose.

1555
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:33,691
We leave the beach at dusk.
We head to the lightning tree.

1556
01:58:34,317 --> 01:58:35,918
That should draw them back to the beach.

1557
01:58:36,152 --> 01:58:39,905
Prior to midnight we then run this
wire from the tree to the water.

1558
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:43,159
Anyone in the water or on the damp sand

1559
01:58:43,534 --> 01:58:44,827
will be electrocuted.

1560
01:58:46,996 --> 01:58:49,165
How do we know
the wire's not gonna burn up?

1561
01:58:49,373 --> 01:58:51,333
Because I invented it.

1562
01:58:51,334 --> 01:58:53,002
I assure you, it won't burn up.

1563
01:59:04,221 --> 01:59:06,349
Well, it's better than hunting them down.

1564
01:59:06,766 --> 01:59:07,767
Yeah, why not?

1565
01:59:08,601 --> 01:59:10,519
If it fails, no harm done anyway, right?

1566
01:59:11,687 --> 01:59:13,522
All right, I say we try it.

1567
01:59:14,023 --> 01:59:16,025
<i>So what can we do to help?</i>

1568
01:59:17,693 --> 01:59:19,528
<i>Keep me alive for the next six hours.</i>

1569
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:22,156
<i>That would be extremely helpful.</i>

1570
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:37,463
I think we need to go.

1571
01:59:37,713 --> 01:59:39,215
This plan's gonna work.

1572
01:59:39,882 --> 01:59:41,092
I think so, too.

1573
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:45,012
And once the Careers are dead,
we both know what happens next.

1574
01:59:45,262 --> 01:59:47,098
I don't want to be the
one that shoots first.

1575
01:59:47,556 --> 01:59:49,475
What if they don't either?

1576
01:59:49,934 --> 01:59:51,811
What if all of us refuse to shoot first?

1577
01:59:52,269 --> 01:59:54,355
We might still end up dead.

1578
01:59:55,398 --> 01:59:58,234
Maybe not. I mean, it
worked for us last time.

1579
01:59:58,567 --> 02:00:00,777
They're not gonna make
that same mistake again.

1580
02:00:00,778 --> 02:00:03,499
You know and I know that there's only one
person walking out of here.

1581
02:00:03,906 --> 02:00:05,991
And it's gonna be one of us.

1582
02:00:08,661 --> 02:00:10,788
The Careers are still out there.

1583
02:00:11,789 --> 02:00:14,625
We should stick with these
guys till midnight.

1584
02:00:15,084 --> 02:00:17,670
And if we hear a cannon, we go.

1585
02:00:30,349 --> 02:00:32,144
Katniss, I don't...

1586
02:00:32,145 --> 02:00:34,185
I don't know what kinda deals
you made with Haymitch

1587
02:00:34,186 --> 02:00:36,397
but he made me promises, too.

1588
02:00:46,282 --> 02:00:47,533
If you die

1589
02:00:48,826 --> 02:00:50,119
and I live

1590
02:00:53,122 --> 02:00:54,457
I'd have nothing.

1591
02:00:56,208 --> 02:00:57,960
Nobody else that I care about.

1592
02:00:58,627 --> 02:00:59,670
Peeta.

1593
02:01:00,045 --> 02:01:01,297
It's different for you.

1594
02:01:01,505 --> 02:01:03,007
Your family needs you.

1595
02:01:12,224 --> 02:01:13,309
You have to live.

1596
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:15,978
For them.

1597
02:01:25,529 --> 02:01:26,989
What about you?

1598
02:01:29,492 --> 02:01:30,868
Nobody needs me.

1599
02:01:34,038 --> 02:01:35,206
I do.

1600
02:01:36,499 --> 02:01:37,708
I need you.

1601
02:02:02,233 --> 02:02:04,068
All right, lovebirds!

1602
02:02:10,074 --> 02:02:12,243
She is preparing to fight.

1603
02:02:12,451 --> 02:02:13,911
That's our girl.

1604
02:02:18,249 --> 02:02:20,376
This is what you predicted.

1605
02:02:27,383 --> 02:02:29,552
Moves and countermoves.

1606
02:02:30,553 --> 02:02:31,637
Indeed.

1607
02:02:36,559 --> 02:02:37,643
We'll toast when it's done?

1608
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:43,065
In the meantime, make yourself comfortable.

1609
02:03:50,507 --> 02:03:52,009
Minimal charring.

1610
02:03:52,468 --> 02:03:53,969
It's an impressive conductor.

1611
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:55,804
Let's get started.

1612
02:03:59,183 --> 02:04:00,643
<i>Typically a lightning strike</i>

1613
02:04:00,768 --> 02:04:03,395
contains five billion joules of energy.

1614
02:04:04,438 --> 02:04:06,857
We don't want to be anywhere
in the vicinity when this hits.

1615
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:10,486
You two girls, go together now.

1616
02:04:10,653 --> 02:04:13,155
Take this. Unspool it carefully.

1617
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:15,282
Make sure the entire coil is in the water.
You understand?

1618
02:04:15,491 --> 02:04:17,158
Then head to the tree at the 2:00 sector.

1619
02:04:17,159 --> 02:04:18,327
We'll meet you there.

1620
02:04:18,827 --> 02:04:20,496
I'm gonna go with them as a guard.

1621
02:04:20,663 --> 02:04:22,665
No, no, no. You're staying
here to protect me.

1622
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:25,208
And the tree.

1623
02:04:25,209 --> 02:04:26,627
No, I need to go with her.

1624
02:04:26,835 --> 02:04:30,255
There are two Careers out there.
I need two guards.

1625
02:04:30,464 --> 02:04:32,341
Finnick can protect you
just fine on his own.

1626
02:04:32,549 --> 02:04:34,050
Why can't Finnick and Johanna stay with you

1627
02:04:34,051 --> 02:04:35,678
and Peeta and I'll take the coil?

1628
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:39,640
You all agreed to keep me
alive till midnight, correct?

1629
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:42,309
It's his plan. We all agreed to it.

1630
02:04:42,518 --> 02:04:44,186
Is there a problem here?

1631
02:04:44,478 --> 02:04:46,230
Excellent question.

1632
02:04:48,065 --> 02:04:50,651
No. There's no problem.

1633
02:04:57,658 --> 02:04:59,576
I'll see you at midnight.

1634
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:02,371
All right, let's go!

1635
02:05:31,108 --> 02:05:32,525
Come on.

1636
02:05:32,526 --> 02:05:36,363
I want to put as much distance
between me and this beach as possible.

1637
02:05:36,572 --> 02:05:38,239
Frying is not how I want to go.

1638
02:05:39,867 --> 02:05:41,410
There's something...

1639
02:05:59,136 --> 02:06:01,138
Stay down.

1640
02:06:08,437 --> 02:06:09,521
Come on.

1641
02:06:28,624 --> 02:06:30,709
Johanna, where are you?

1642
02:06:42,096 --> 02:06:43,889
Johanna?

1643
02:06:47,935 --> 02:06:48,977
Peeta.

1644
02:07:03,575 --> 02:07:04,576
Peeta.

1645
02:07:09,456 --> 02:07:10,457
Oh.

1646
02:07:18,298 --> 02:07:20,134
Beetee. Beetee!

1647
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,021
Peeta!

1648
02:07:39,194 --> 02:07:40,362
Peeta!

1649
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:56,753
Katniss, where are you?

1650
02:08:05,387 --> 02:08:07,347
Let it fly, Miss Everdeen.

1651
02:08:07,556 --> 02:08:10,142
Let it fly.

1652
02:08:20,068 --> 02:08:21,236
Katniss.

1653
02:08:25,532 --> 02:08:27,534
Remember who the real enemy is.

1654
02:09:06,198 --> 02:09:07,574
Katniss, get away from that tree!

1655
02:09:14,289 --> 02:09:15,958
Katniss, get away from that tree!

1656
02:09:35,978 --> 02:09:37,896
It's not possible.

1657
02:09:41,149 --> 02:09:42,317
Heavensbee!

1658
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:48,490
Plutarch Heavensbee!

1659
02:09:53,954 --> 02:09:56,290
Sir, we've lost power.

1660
02:12:23,103 --> 02:12:26,355
She's gonna lose it
when she finds out about the boy.

1661
02:12:26,356 --> 02:12:28,649
She'll still cooperate, though?

1662
02:12:28,650 --> 02:12:30,943
Without Peeta?
There's no guarantee.

1663
02:12:30,944 --> 02:12:33,238
Just tell her win...

1664
02:12:37,868 --> 02:12:39,119
Morning, sweetheart.

1665
02:12:45,167 --> 02:12:47,835
What are you doing with them?

1666
02:12:47,836 --> 02:12:50,547
You and a syringe against The Capitol?

1667
02:12:50,797 --> 02:12:52,883
See, this is why no one
lets you make the plans.

1668
02:12:53,508 --> 02:12:55,010
What the hell are you doing in here?

1669
02:12:55,177 --> 02:12:57,512
Stop. Stop. Just listen.

1670
02:12:57,637 --> 02:13:01,140
We couldn't tell you with Snow watching.
It was too risky.

1671
02:13:01,141 --> 02:13:03,393
Better for you to know nothing.

1672
02:13:05,353 --> 02:13:06,354
Where's Peeta?

1673
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:07,481
Now, Katniss...

1674
02:13:07,731 --> 02:13:09,816
You have been our mission
from the beginning.

1675
02:13:10,192 --> 02:13:12,485
The plan was always to get you out.

1676
02:13:12,486 --> 02:13:14,237
Half the Tributes were in on it.

1677
02:13:14,488 --> 02:13:16,072
This is the revolution.

1678
02:13:16,531 --> 02:13:18,533
And you are the Mockingjay.

1679
02:13:19,242 --> 02:13:21,744
And we're on our way to
District 13 right now.

1680
02:13:21,745 --> 02:13:22,746
13?

1681
02:13:22,996 --> 02:13:24,706
13. Yes.

1682
02:13:24,998 --> 02:13:26,166
Where's Peeta?

1683
02:13:27,709 --> 02:13:29,753
He still has his tracker in his arm.

1684
02:13:30,003 --> 02:13:31,379
Johanna cut yours out.

1685
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:33,590
Where is he?

1686
02:13:33,757 --> 02:13:35,050
In The Capitol.

1687
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:38,553
They got him and Johanna.

1688
02:13:39,054 --> 02:13:41,890
You son of a bitch! You son of a...

1689
02:13:42,098 --> 02:13:44,893
You promised me that
you would save him over me!

1690
02:13:45,101 --> 02:13:49,773
You promised me! You're a liar.
You're a liar.

1691
02:14:13,421 --> 02:14:14,714
Hey, Catnip.

1692
02:14:15,715 --> 02:14:17,132
You're okay.

1693
02:14:17,133 --> 02:14:18,968
You've just been asleep for a few days.

1694
02:14:18,969 --> 02:14:20,220
Are we home?

1695
02:14:29,229 --> 02:14:30,313
Gale?

1696
02:14:32,482 --> 02:14:33,650
Where's Prim?

1697
02:14:34,150 --> 02:14:35,485
She's alive.

1698
02:14:36,611 --> 02:14:39,239
So is your mother. I got 'em out in time.

1699
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:41,616
Got them out?

1700
02:14:42,617 --> 02:14:44,119
After The Games,

1701
02:14:44,494 --> 02:14:46,288
they sent in hovercrafts.

1702
02:14:49,332 --> 02:14:51,918
And they started dropping firebombs.

1703
02:14:56,131 --> 02:14:57,591
They're not in 12?

1704
02:14:59,968 --> 02:15:01,803
There is no District 12.

1705
02:15:03,471 --> 02:15:04,806
It's all gone.
