Sir.

What is that?

43
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,534
A bird, sir.

44
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:44,691
- A bird?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:45,650
A lark?

46
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,808
- Yes, sir.
- Very good.

On the window.

48
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:51,050
- This line...
- The window.

49
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,968
- Very exact.
- Thank you, sir.

50
00:09:54,406 --> 00:10:01,005
But you don't come here to draw,
to write poems...of to dream.

51
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,683
Do you Baumer?

52
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:04,237
No.

53
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,073
Sit down.

54
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:14,911
Gentlemen, you have all passed
your examinations.

55
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:17,433
As you know, you are graduated.

56
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,665
The time for class is over.

57
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:25,105
The time for duty has begun.

58
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:30,860
You are dismissed. Herr Baumer...

59
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:33,142
You may stay.

60
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:50,290
Cigarette?

61
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:53,282
No, thank you, sir.

62
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:54,720
Oh, you don't smoke.

63
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:57,962
Well, it is not a good habit.

64
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:01,319
But all good habits,
makes a dull person.

65
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,112
What do the English say?

66
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:06,114
- All work and no play makes...
- A dull man.

67
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:09,595
A dull... Yes, yes, very good.

68
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:15,944
There's a time for work and for play.

69
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,221
You are a dreamer, Baumer.

70
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:27,702
You draw little sketches
and write little poems.

71
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:32,018
But now you're a man,
you have your duties as a man,

72
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:33,811
your duty to the Fatherland.

73
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:40,409
Will you wait to be called up
of will you enlist?

74
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,526
- Well...
- Of course, you'll respond to duty.

75
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,569
You will all respond.

76
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:50,364
The entire class will go
as one man to serve the Fatherland.

77
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:55,524
I know I will be proud of you,
Baumer.

78
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,038
'Today is wonderfully good.

79
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:05,229
'Everyone has eaten for two men
and the mail has come.

Paul? Paul?

88
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:17,186
We're going to see Kemmerich.

89
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,717
Nurse, can you tell me
where Franz Kemmerich is?

90
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,760
Yes, he's through there.

91
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:00,228
Franz.

92
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:03,469
How are you?

93
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,106
Someone stole my watch.

94
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:08,504
- Bastards!
- I warned you, Franz.

95
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:11,621
- I know.
- We'll tell the doctor.

96
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,217
You'll be going home soon.

97
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,656
Do you think?

98
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:22,295
I feel... I'm all right.

99
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:28,653
My foot. It's so painful.

100
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,166
It's so cold.

101
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,002
That pain is your ticket home.

102
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:37,764
You should be grateful
to that pain.

103
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,238
telling fat lies
to Katrine Hammerschmidt.

104
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:48,554
Here's some smokes
and a piece of cheese from Kat,

105
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:50,836
and your comb is in the tobacco tin.

106
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,193
Put them under the bed, please.

107
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:58,633
Hide them.
You know they stole my watch.

108
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,545
Franz, will you be taking
these back home with you?

109
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:08,463
Why not?

110
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:11,695
Well, you don't really need
boots back home.

111
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,019
We could trade.

112
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:16,500
- I've got...
- No! My mother gave me those.

113
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,492
- You could lend them to me?
- No.

114
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,890
You'll be home a lot sooner than us.

115
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,687
Orderly. Orderly!

116
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,324
They don't come. They never come.

117
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:33,523
We'll get someone.

118
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:36,285
- It'll be different at home.
- When you return...

119
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,922
- ..We'll be together.
- We'll come tomorrow.

120
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:42,279
- I'll come tomorrow.
- Thank you. Thank you.

121
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:45,521
I'll be back.

122
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:47,678
Make sure you get my watch.

123
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:48,877
We will.

124
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,415
You think I don't care about Franz.

125
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:12,738
Of course I care.

126
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:18,732
If I could save his leg or life, I'd
walk over barbed wire. You know that.

127
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:22,089
But where he's going,
he won't need his boots.

128
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,767
He won't need anything.

129
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:26,289
And my boots hurt. They really hurt.

130
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:29,166
Why should some damn orderly
get his boots

131
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:31,085
and not one of his friends.

132
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:34,441
He's right, Paul.

133
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:43,312
I know.

134
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:53,392
Very good, Kemmerich.

135
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,982
Very good, Kemmerich.

136
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,777
They've amputated my leg.

137
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:12,697
Could be worse.

138
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:17,128
Wegler lost his right arm,
which is very much worse.

139
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:20,485
Besides, you're going home.

140
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,767
Do you think so?

141
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,050
Of course.

142
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:26,968
Do you think so?

143
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,919
Once you get over the operation.

144
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:35,235
I don't think so.

145
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:39,915
Don't talk nonsense.

146
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,232
I wanted to be a forester once.

147
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,382
You will.

148
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:05,819
You can do anything.

149
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,854
If you find my watch, send it home.

150
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:16,128
You'll go to a convalescent home.

151
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,766
Maybe the one in Klosterberg.

152
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:23,801
Remember how we hiked up there?

153
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:25,604
Remember the poplars?

154
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:29,919
The stream full of fish?

155
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:39,030
Franz, Franz... When I come back,
we go up to the mountains again.

156
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,471
You can name all the trees for me.

157
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,504
Tell me all about them.

158
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:50,548
Franz, nothing will change.

159
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,905
We'd be together again.

160
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:57,377
Franz.

161
00:18:58,336 --> 00:18:59,295
Franz.

162
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:06,497
Give...Müller...my...boots.

163
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:15,723
Doctor? Doctor?
Where's the doctor? Doctor!

164
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:18,840
Doctor!

165
00:19:18,964 --> 00:19:20,048
Where's the doctor?

166
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:21,966
Doctor?

167
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,917
Doctor! Quickly,
Franz Kemmerich is dying.

168
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,116
Which one's that?

169
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:29,034
Bed 36, amputated leg.

170
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,391
How should I know that?
I've amputated five legs today.

171
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,954
You see to it.

172
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:41,147
Today there have been sixteen deaths,
yours will be the seventeenth.

173
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,305
There'll probably be twenty
altogether.

174
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:50,498
We must take him away at once.
We need the bed.

175
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,905
They're lying on the floor outside.

176
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:13,409
Paul.

177
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:14,483
Yes, Mrs Kemmerich?

178
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:17,725
- I want you to promise.
- What, Mrs Kemmerich?

179
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,122
- Look after Franz.
- Of course...

180
00:20:20,238 --> 00:20:24,074
He looks up to you.
He'll do anything you ask, you know?

181
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:28,035
Make him stay away from danger.
You know how reckless he is.

182
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,077
I'll make sure he behaves himself.

183
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,070
God bless you both.

184
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,352
Maria, Maria.

185
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:42,190
Look after your brother.

186
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,340
I'll see you soon. Take care.
Bye-bye, Mother, bye-bye.

187
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:50,102
Right, come on, boys. Wake up!

188
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:53,574
Let's go. Hey, wake up there.
Come on.

189
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:56,211
Come on, come on, Come on!

190
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:59,213
It's beautiful here. Come on.

191
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,454
Let's go. Wake up. Food.

192
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:04,612
Come on.

193
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:13,004
Oh, Kat.
I don't know how you do it.

194
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,162
Next time you come with me,

195
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:17,559
I'll show you how to find food.

196
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:20,197
When I'm not here,
it'll come in handy.

197
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,000
What? You'll always be here.

198
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,752
Ah, up here
'always' isn't a long time.

199
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:27,629
Anyway, you'd better learn
so you won't go hungry.

200
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,027
You pay attention to the teacher.

201
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,303
He's coming. He's coming.

202
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:41,900
What did he want?

203
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,578
Doesn't matter. We're free.

204
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:48,143
Time for work, for duty.
You will enlist, the entire class.

205
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:50,656
Of course.
Behm, you too.

206
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:54,013
- Maybe I can't. My eyes.
- They will.

207
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,295
But not tonight.
Tonight we get drunk.

208
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,891
Iron Youth. Iron Youth.

209
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,685
To Max's!

210
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:16,195
# We'll be the guardians of the Rhine

211
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:19,791
# O Fatherland beloved

212
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:23,637
# Fatherland beloved

213
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,910
# Faithful and true

214
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:30,226
# Along the Rhine we'll stand

215
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:32,624
# Watch o'er the Rhine

216
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:37,179
# Defend our Fatherland... #

217
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:50,970
# We'll be the guardians of the Rhine

218
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,576
# O Fatherland beloved

219
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:58,412
# O Fatherland beloved

220
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,925
# Faithful and true

221
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:05,365
# Along the Rhine we'll stand

222
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,878
# Watch o'er the Rhine

223
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:12,078
# Defend our Fatherland #

224
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,312
Lert...face.

225
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:23,827
Form in three ranks.

226
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,828
Three groups.

227
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:41,339
At ease.

228
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,403
My name is Himmestoss.

229
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:17,792
You'll find I'll be a good teacher.
Do you know why?

230
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:28,706
Never.

231
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:30,624
Attention!

232
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:31,823
At ease.

233
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:35,064
Attention!

234
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:37,337
Right face.

235
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:40,933
Lert face.

236
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:44,655
Right face.

237
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,606
Forward march.

238
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,370
Left, left, left, left, left.

239
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:57,122
Left, left, left.

240
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:01,677
left, left, left, forward.

241
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:04,679
Right turn...march.

242
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:11,757
Turn! Left! Left! Left!
Left! Left! Stop!

243
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,550
Attention!

244
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:19,065
Right face!

245
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,628
Eyes front!

246
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:22,786
Right face!

247
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,903
Forward march!

248
00:25:26,143 --> 00:25:29,979
Left! Left! Forward.

249
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,022
On the double.

250
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:33,940
Quick march!

251
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,057
Left, left, left, forward.

252
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:39,694
Right turn... March!

253
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:46,771
Left, left, left, left,
Left, left, left, left... Forward!

254
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:49,524
Right turn... March!

255
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:54,444
Left, left, left, left, left, left,

256
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,999
left, left, left, left, left, left,

257
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:03,440
Left, left, left...
Forward! Lie down!

258
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:06,671
Ready.

259
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,434
Stand up!

260
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:12,790
Advance.

261
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:15,552
Lie down.

262
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:19,628
Ready...

263
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:20,702
Stand up!

264
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:24,778
Advance.

265
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:28,864
Lie down!

266
00:26:30,782 --> 00:26:32,575
Ready...

267
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,659
Stand up.

268
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:37,850
Advance.

269
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:07,954
Lie down!

270
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:11,551
Ready...

271
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:12,625
Stand up!

272
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:16,106
Advance.

273
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:19,942
Lie down!

274
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:23,539
Ready...

275
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:24,498
Stand up!

276
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,854
Advance.

277
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:31,451
Lie down!

278
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:35,057
Ready...

279
00:27:35,651 --> 00:27:36,850
Stand up!

280
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:41,406
You.

281
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:47,160
Again.

282
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:51,360
Again!

283
00:28:04,672 --> 00:28:05,986
Baumer.

284
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:11,030
Again.

285
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:14,742
Again.

286
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,133
You'll pay for this, Baumer.

287
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,459
Rirle. Fill your pack.

288
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,856
No, no, Corporal.

289
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:32,848
You must keep
your eyes open, Corporal.

290
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:38,646
Attack!

291
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:42,722
Lay down.

292
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:08,261
Your training days are over.

293
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:12,941
You are soldiers now
in the Imperial Army.

294
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:23,251
In the front lines you will
understand the value and the purpose

295
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:25,044
of all you've learned here,

296
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:27,806
everything your officers
have taught you.

297
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:31,403
Their ways have sometimes
seemed harsh to you,

298
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:38,241
for the lessons
they taught you in this camp.

299
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:41,722
They've taught you to be soldiers.

300
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:45,558
To be soldiers
in the service of Almighty God,

301
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:48,790
the Kaiser and the Fatherland.

302
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:54,669
Right...face.

303
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,349
Forward...march.

304
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:47,915
Forward...march.

305
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:16,091
Open up.

306
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:24,078
Shoulder weapons.

307
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:31,760
Right face.

308
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,910
Board the train.

309
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:03,293
No smoking.

310
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:06,889
No smoking.

311
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:12,289
Fifth company, get down.

312
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:13,488
Hold up.

313
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:19,366
Second Company.
This way. Fall out, two ranks.

314
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:54,017
So... Here you are.

315
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:02,772
It's the custom to assign
one old hand to every new platoon.

316
00:36:02,888 --> 00:36:04,086
You're the new platoon.

317
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,973
I'm the old hand.

318
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:21,714
I'll teach you practic...
Listen to me, boy.

319
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,715
I'll teach you practical things.

320
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,469
And how to kill Frenchies.

321
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:39,350
First we'll give you hot food,
let you get some sleep,

322
00:36:42,822 --> 00:36:43,906
Tonight.

323
00:37:13,885 --> 00:37:15,679
Frenchie wants to say hello.

324
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:19,275
You just stick close to Kat,

325
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,632
and move when I tell you to move.

326
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,547
Get down. Off the road.

327
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:39,664
Take cover. Off the road!

328
00:38:07,726 --> 00:38:09,999
Shoot the wounded horses!

329
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:11,677
Shoot them!

330
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,632
Shoot them, can't you?

331
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,550
Shoot them.

332
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:35,308
Hey! You're crazy?
You want to kill somebody?

333
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:36,622
Get down.

334
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:06,477
Why? What have they done?
They haven't done anything.

335
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:14,159
Using horses is wrong.
It's wrong killing horses.

336
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:21,831
Come on, let's go, boys.

337
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:24,708
Get up.

338
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:32,984
Up. Come on, boys.

339
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:41,376
Everybody here?

340
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,097
Huh? Link up, boys.

341
00:39:49,288 --> 00:39:52,050
A taste of the real thing.
You'll get used to it.

342
00:39:53,364 --> 00:39:54,448
You ready?

343
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:56,730
All right.

344
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:03,444
Well, you're almost getting
to be soldiers now.

345
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:07,520
You stick with Kat
and you'll be all right.

346
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,501
'We have been at the front
for a year. We are soldiers now.

347
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,180
'We know this place well.

348
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:29,587
'We are at home.

349
00:40:29,587 --> 00:40:34,382
'Only Kemmerich is dead but we keep
hearing about others in our class;

350
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:36,780
'dead, wounded.

351
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:45,047
'If a shot comes,
all we can do is duck,

352
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:47,809
'because we can never know
where it will fall.

353
00:40:55,126 --> 00:40:57,879
'I can be smashed to bits
in a bomb-proof dugout,

354
00:40:58,003 --> 00:41:00,996
'of I can survive ten hours
unscathed out in the open.

355
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:12,514
'Of course, every soldier believes
in chance and trusts his luck.

356
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:15,266
'But no soldier outlives
a thousand chances.

357
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:24,262
'We call them corpse rats.

358
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:27,858
'They have shocking evil faces
and even on our empty stomachs,

359
00:41:27,983 --> 00:41:31,215
'it is nauseating
to see their long naked tais.

360

'The bait is bread,
so rotten even we won't eat it.

00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:49,322
'they'll come among us
to snatch them away.

362
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,565
'It's a way to pass the time.'

363
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:11,754
Gas masks. Gas masks.

364
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:16,904
'Gas, the most feared,
most obscene weapon of all.

'The gas patients who, surfocating,

367

'cough up their burned lungs

368

'Better take your chances

369
00:42:27,942 --> 00:42:32,018
'than stay in the hollows
where the vapours settle.'

370
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:38,086
'The new recruits are more trouble
than they are worth.

No, don't! No!

374
00:43:51,877 --> 00:43:52,961
Get him.

375
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:19,335
Hand me a rifle. Hand me a rifle.

376
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:26,058
Kat, wait!

377
00:44:43,205 --> 00:44:44,644
A baby.

378
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:49,794
Just a baby.

379
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:24,808
They're in position.

380
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,851
- Nearby?
- Yes, sir.

381
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:28,529
'How long has it been?

382
00:45:28,654 --> 00:45:33,449
'Weeks, months, years? Only days.

'Yesterday we were under fire.
Today we can rest.

384

'Tomorrow we go up
to the trenches again.'

385
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,025
Boys, boys, come here.

386
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,778
Look, you boys go on that side.

387
00:46:09,778 --> 00:46:11,456
Over here. This way.

388
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:12,780
Easy, easy.

389
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,658
Get around, get around up there.

390
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:23,329
This way.

391
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:26,206
It's gone.

392
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:30,646
Quick, he'll get away.
Get him, get him, get him!

393
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:50,671
Someone eat the liver. I'm on a diet.

394
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:02,899
and the sturfing would have been
something very special.

395
00:47:03,983 --> 00:47:05,546
But all considered...

396
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:07,579
A feast. I feel like a king.

397
00:47:07,704 --> 00:47:09,737
Ah, not bad, not bad.

398
00:47:10,696 --> 00:47:13,698
Like I say,
it's not a bad little war.

399
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:18,253
You never answered
my question, Joseph.

400
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,046
What question?

401
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:24,372
What we'll all do. Get drunk.

402
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:26,405
Of course he'll get drunk.

403
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:29,522
Then it's back home
and mama and all that.

404
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,085
But what ese?

405
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,722
Well, tell him, Joseph.
Don't be ashamed.

406
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:35,161
I'm not ashamed.

407
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:38,278
He's going to theology school
to be a minister.

408
00:47:40,436 --> 00:47:44,272
A year here and you haven't changed
your mind about that.

409
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:46,909
Is God still in his heaven?

410
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,348
Nothing ever changes that.

411
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:52,069
What about you?
Back to the cobbler's bench, eh?

412
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:53,623
And the children.

413
00:47:53,747 --> 00:47:55,071
How many you got?

414
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:57,583
Don't ask.
Good thing I'm a shoemaker,

415
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,345
of I'd go broke just buying shoes.

416
00:48:06,694 --> 00:48:09,572
More coffins.
A bigger load than usual.

417
00:48:09,572 --> 00:48:11,854
That means a bigger offensive.

418
00:48:16,774 --> 00:48:18,692
How considerate
they are at headquarters.

419
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:23,602
Come on, get this one down.

420
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:25,645
Haul them up.

421
00:48:42,313 --> 00:48:43,991
Careful, careful.

422
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:50,590
How old are you?

423
00:48:50,944 --> 00:48:52,143
Sixteen.

424
00:48:54,426 --> 00:48:56,459
Next year, fight out of the cradle.

425
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:07,497
Did you notch this bayonet?

426
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:08,456
Yes, sir.

427
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,928
Who told you to?

428
00:49:11,928 --> 00:49:13,971
- At the training camp...
- Training camp, eh?

429
00:49:15,649 --> 00:49:19,965
Sonny, if the enemy ever caught you
with this, they wouldn't kill you,

430
00:49:23,926 --> 00:49:25,844
Nobody uses these things any more.

431
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:28,961
It's by mutual agreement,
on both sides.

432
00:49:29,076 --> 00:49:30,514
I didn't know.

433
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,432
- First time?
- Yes, sir.

434
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:35,319
Don't 'sir' me. I'm a private.

435
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:36,518
Sorry, I thought...

436
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:38,916
Don't think. Just listen.

437
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:40,114
Yes, sir.

438
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:44,066
Your spade is better.

439
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,662
You hit a man under the chin.
Take his head off.

440
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:50,069
It's a good club, too.

441
00:49:50,184 --> 00:49:51,383
Cos it's heavy.

442
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:57,137
Hit a man between neck and shoulder.
Right here. Split him right in two.

443
00:49:57,262 --> 00:49:59,295
- Mother of God!
- It's cleaner.

444
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,213
Bayonet gets stuck in ribs,

445
00:50:01,213 --> 00:50:03,371
you have to kick him to pull it out.

446
00:50:04,455 --> 00:50:07,092
Time it takes, you're a dead man.

447
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,334
Understand?

448
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:16,328
Now, where is your platoon leader?

449
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:18,601
Corporal Himmestoss
said he'd meet us here.

450
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:19,684
Ah.

451
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:21,957
Corporal who?

452
00:50:21,957 --> 00:50:23,405
Himmestoss.

453
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,959
From Oldenberg training station?

454
00:50:25,084 --> 00:50:26,043
Yes, sir.

455
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:28,076
I don't believe it!

456
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,078
Vengeance is mine.

457
00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:37,427
No, sir. He got into trouble.

458
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:41,992
Overdid it with two trainees on
the muddy field. You know the field?

459
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:45,108
Do we know the muddy field?

460
00:50:45,348 --> 00:50:47,746
He went too far. Almost killed them.

461
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:50,978
He didn't see the son of the local
magistrate watching.

462
00:50:51,103 --> 00:50:54,459
So, he's here.
Of course he'd spoil it for himself.

463
00:50:57,336 --> 00:51:01,297
Oh, Lord. I can hardly wait.

464
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:05,853
Oh, well. Look who's here.

465
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:19,883
Well, we meet again.

466
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:27,316
Kropp, isn't it? You remember me,
Corporal Himmestoss.

467
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:31,277
Müller, you here too?
Oh, yes, I remember you very well.

468
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:38,345
Lehr, Behm, Baumer...Baumer.

469
00:51:40,387 --> 00:51:41,826
Nothing wrong with my memory!

470
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:50,343
You've all managed
to stay alive.

471
00:51:50,343 --> 00:51:51,656
Not Kemmerich.

472
00:51:51,781 --> 00:51:55,857
Kemmerich?
I don't remember Kemmerich.

473
00:51:55,857 --> 00:51:59,089
The rest of you seem to have learned
your lessons pretty well.

474
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:05,447
don't you turn your back.

475
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:07,490
What did you say?

476
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,120
So this is the great
Corporal Himmestoss?

477
00:52:13,244 --> 00:52:14,923
And who are you?

478
00:52:16,121 --> 00:52:17,675
I asked you a question, soldier.

479
00:52:19,478 --> 00:52:24,273
Himmestoss.
There's a latfine down the road.

480
00:52:24,273 --> 00:52:26,431
Why don't you take a jump?

481
00:52:31,226 --> 00:52:33,029
Do you want to be court martialled?

482
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,105
Stand up straight, hees together,

483
00:52:37,105 --> 00:52:38,908
when your superior officer
speaks to you.

484
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:41,421
All of you!

485
00:52:46,935 --> 00:52:49,573
Squad, attention!

486
00:52:52,814 --> 00:52:54,732
Right...face.

487
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,288
Right turn, forward...march.

488
00:52:59,288 --> 00:53:03,364
Left, left, left, left.

489
00:53:03,364 --> 00:53:07,200
Left, left,
left, left, left, left.

490
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,796
Easy, boy, easy.
It'll be all right.

491
00:53:47,134 --> 00:53:52,649
Ah, you see the way he blows up?
Boom, like that.

492
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,130
Want to kill Frenchmen?

493
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:25,151
You'll be all right, boy.

494
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,069
You'll get used to it.

495
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,907
To soften us up so we can't sleep.

496
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:35,345
Huh, then when they attack,

497
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,296
we won't be able to fight back
because we're too tired.

498
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,497
Two days and nights. How much longer?

499
00:54:43,977 --> 00:54:46,614
Not too long, not too long.

500
00:54:46,614 --> 00:54:48,292
Why don't they stop?

501
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:08,077
Where are you going?

502
00:55:08,077 --> 00:55:10,235
I'll be back...in a minute.

503
00:55:10,235 --> 00:55:14,676
No, just relax. Wait. It'll be over
soon. Come on, sit down and relax.

504
00:55:17,668 --> 00:55:21,034
Let me go. I must get away.

505
00:55:28,102 --> 00:55:30,020
Sit down and calm down.

506
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:34,096
Now, go and sit down.
Behave yourselves. Be easy, quiet.

507
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:36,858
I said...

508
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:48,491
Come on, let's go.
Come on...come on.

this day

575

From this day on, your Kaiser urges
you all to aspire to such strength,

576

to such bravery, to such obedience
to your God and your country.

You have shown the world our might.

You have stricken
our enemies with fear.

583
01:12:25,106 --> 01:12:27,983
It'll take weeks
to get to the skin!

- How's the water?

You want bread?

601
01:13:26,254 --> 01:13:29,017
Look! Regardez!

602
01:13:29,142 --> 01:13:32,258
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum, yes? Bread!

603
01:13:32,258 --> 01:13:34,291
You come over here, oui?

604
01:13:35,136 --> 01:13:36,574
Vous!

605
01:13:36,574 --> 01:13:38,013
Venez!

606

They want us to come
to their house tonight!

612
01:13:52,398 --> 01:13:55,755
Oui! Avec quelque chose
a manger, oui?

613
01:13:55,755 --> 01:13:59,236
- With something to eat!
- La maison lá!

614
01:13:59,236 --> 01:14:01,030

615

- Bye! Bye!

616
01:14:12,787 --> 01:14:14,581
Drink up, Tjaden.

617
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:25,734
It's bad luck there's four of us
and three of them.

618
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:28,611
Mm-hmm... Bad luck.

619
01:14:28,736 --> 01:14:31,853
See, it's just not fair
to the gifs.

620
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:36,169
Drink up, Tjaden. How often
do you get good French wine?

621
01:14:36,293 --> 01:14:40,245
Not fair to the gifs... No.

622
01:14:40,245 --> 01:14:44,561
One of us will have to make
the supreme sacrifice.

623
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:46,239
Mmm?

624
01:14:46,363 --> 01:14:50,075
Bottoms up, Tjaden,
you're not keeping up with us.

625
01:14:53,316 --> 01:14:55,954
Maybe we should draw lots?

626
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,989
You lose.

627
01:15:44,884 --> 01:15:46,917
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

628
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:36,442
This looks like
the right line-up, huh?

629
01:16:36,442 --> 01:16:38,964
I'm all for this one.

630
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:41,477
You like yours, Albert?

631
01:16:41,477 --> 01:16:43,395
Yes.

632
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,833
Paul?

633
01:17:24,289 --> 01:17:26,446
Mais tu es blanc comme neige,
je crois.

634
01:17:26,571 --> 01:17:27,885
Er...

635
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,565
Est-ce que je me trompe,
petit bon homme.

636
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,003
Oui!

637
01:18:25,926 --> 01:18:27,125
Mon petit soldat.

638
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:40,196
Non, non. Ici.

639
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:54,582
- Quelle age a-tu?
- Eh?

640
01:18:54,707 --> 01:18:56,625
- Ton age?
- No...

641
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,742
- Quelle age a-tu?
- Ah! I'm 19.

642
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,024
19...

643
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,901
19... Oh!

644
01:19:13,168 --> 01:19:16,410
Vingt-cinq ans? Vraiment?

645
01:20:35,435 --> 01:20:39,511
Look out! Look out! Take cover!

646
01:21:54,814 --> 01:21:57,816
- My leg!
- Come on, Albert! Up! Up!

647
01:22:03,695 --> 01:22:06,448
Come on, boys,
a little bit more.

648
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,273
Down! Stay down!

649
01:23:10,483 --> 01:23:12,161
I'll be right back!

650
01:23:45,977 --> 01:23:47,300
Hey!

651
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:09,243
Paul!

652
01:24:11,525 --> 01:24:12,964
Take care!

653
01:24:25,067 --> 01:24:26,746
Kat.

654
01:24:32,864 --> 01:24:34,187
Kat!

655
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:35,981
Kat, come on!

656
01:24:42,819 --> 01:24:44,977
- All right.
- Easy, easy.

657
01:24:58,643 --> 01:25:01,050
- From Kat.
- What is it?

658
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:04,762
- It's a long ride.
- Oh, bread and cheese!

659
01:25:05,846 --> 01:25:09,921
He could find a lobster dinner
in the middle of the desert!

660
01:25:12,559 --> 01:25:14,237
Goodbye.

661
01:25:14,237 --> 01:25:16,395
- Take care, Paul.
- Bye.

662
01:25:43,258 --> 01:25:46,490
'Albert and I
are in a Catholic hospital.

663
01:26:48,607 --> 01:26:51,724
- Won't see him again.
- Why not?

664
01:26:56,039 --> 01:26:58,082
The "Dead Room"?

665
01:26:58,082 --> 01:27:00,479
What's the Dead Room?

666
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:03,356
The Dying Room,
whatever you call it.

667
01:27:03,481 --> 01:27:05,515
It's in the basement.

668
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:15,594
It's convenient really.
It's next to the mortuary.

669
01:27:16,908 --> 01:27:18,586
No one ever comes back.

670
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:30,104
'The beds empty quickly,
and new occupants take their places.

671
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:34,420
'It is going badly with Albert.
He is in much pain.

672
01:27:34,535 --> 01:27:38,496
'Last night one of our wardmates
awakened with a severe haemoffhage.

673
01:28:05,474 --> 01:28:08,830
They won't take me! No! NO!

674
01:28:08,956 --> 01:28:12,187
We're taking you
to the bandaging room.

675
01:28:12,312 --> 01:28:15,429
I won't go to the Dying Room!

676
01:28:15,429 --> 01:28:17,461
We're not going there.

677
01:28:17,461 --> 01:28:19,390
Then why take his tunic?

678
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:24,060
- I'll be back. I won't die!
- Why are you taking his tunic?

679
01:28:24,185 --> 01:28:27,781
I'll come back!
I won't die! I'll come back!

680
01:28:27,896 --> 01:28:29,220
Liars!

681
01:28:29,335 --> 01:28:31,013
They're lying.

682
01:28:31,138 --> 01:28:33,056
LIARS!

683
01:28:35,933 --> 01:28:40,728
I'll come back!
I'll come back! I won't die...

684
01:28:55,603 --> 01:28:57,396
Stop it!

685
01:28:57,521 --> 01:29:00,877
Stop it! Stop that! Orderly!

686
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,035
Get the orderly! Doctor!

687
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:05,193
Orderly! Orderly!

688
01:29:24,614 --> 01:29:27,261
Why didn't you leave him alone?

689
01:29:41,886 --> 01:29:44,763
You are doing so well, Paul.

690
01:29:44,888 --> 01:29:47,161
Soon we'll throw away the cane.

691
01:29:51,716 --> 01:29:53,874
- Sister.
- Yes?

692
01:29:55,313 --> 01:29:57,231
I'm worried about my friend.

693
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:02,870
I think...he is making
a very good recovery.

694
01:30:02,995 --> 01:30:05,392
He worries me.

695
01:30:05,507 --> 01:30:08,145
Since the operation, he...

696
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:13,180
He's in a terrible state of mind.
He hardly speaks to me any more.

697
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:18,704
There is always such a reaction after
an amputation.

698
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:20,497
Always!

699
01:30:20,622 --> 01:30:23,499
Now, stop worrying.

700
01:30:23,614 --> 01:30:25,896
Albert will get over it.

701
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:28,649
Go, tell him your good news.

702
01:30:28,774 --> 01:30:30,816
That should cheer him up.

703
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:48,204
Albert?

704
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:50,237
How do you feel?

705
01:31:05,946 --> 01:31:11,460
Albert, they're giving me 16 days
convalescent leave. I'm going home.

706
01:31:13,023 --> 01:31:15,296
They'll be sending you home, too.

707
01:31:15,421 --> 01:31:18,174
Is there anything I can get you?

708
01:31:19,497 --> 01:31:20,936
A gun.

709
01:31:25,376 --> 01:31:26,814
A what?

710
01:31:28,848 --> 01:31:32,924
You want to get me something?
Get me a gun.

711
01:31:37,249 --> 01:31:41,680
- Will you get me a gun or not?
- No! Don't talk nonsense!

712
01:31:41,805 --> 01:31:45,161
No, you talk sense.

713
01:31:50,676 --> 01:31:52,229
Albert...

714
01:31:55,471 --> 01:31:56,794
I'm sorry.

715
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,344
Paul?

716
01:34:05,459 --> 01:34:10,139
Paul! Why didn't you tell us
you were coming?

717
01:34:10,254 --> 01:34:12,652
Mother. Mother!

718
01:34:30,759 --> 01:34:34,115
Paul? Come up.

719
01:34:52,346 --> 01:34:54,380
Give me your handkerchief.

720
01:35:12,976 --> 01:35:14,529
How is she?

721
01:35:16,687 --> 01:35:18,730
She's in bed.

722
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,763
She's sick, Paul.

723
01:35:21,847 --> 01:35:23,765
What is it?

724
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:25,798
We don't know.

725
01:35:25,923 --> 01:35:32,396
But...Dr Bradermeier thinks...
it's probably the cancer again.

726
01:36:07,411 --> 01:36:09,089
Thank God.

727
01:36:11,726 --> 01:36:13,884
Oh, thank God.

728
01:36:16,886 --> 01:36:18,689
Thank God.

729
01:36:20,367 --> 01:36:22,161
Are you wounded, Paul?

730
01:36:24,559 --> 01:36:27,675
No... No, I'm just on leave.

731
01:36:29,114 --> 01:36:31,396
- Oh, Paul.
- How are you?

732
01:36:31,512 --> 01:36:36,076
I'm going to try to get up
a little today, I think.

733
01:36:36,191 --> 01:36:37,515
Good.

734
01:36:43,864 --> 01:36:46,386
My Paul.

735
01:36:48,784 --> 01:36:50,586
My Paul.

736
01:36:52,504 --> 01:36:53,818
Look.

737
01:36:58,019 --> 01:36:59,333
Bread.

738
01:37:01,136 --> 01:37:05,087
And cheese and...butter!

739
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:10,007
They feed you enough where you are?

740
01:37:10,132 --> 01:37:12,770
Not always enough, but we manage.

741
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:16,126
Is it very bad there?

742
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:19,483
No.

743
01:37:19,598 --> 01:37:21,516
Not so bad.

744
01:37:21,641 --> 01:37:24,518
Heinrich Bradermeier was here

745
01:37:24,642 --> 01:37:30,272
and said it's terrible out there,
with the gas attacks

746
01:37:30,396 --> 01:37:32,554
and all the rest of it.

747
01:37:32,669 --> 01:37:34,232
It's just talk.

748
01:37:34,232 --> 01:37:36,266
Just talk.

749
01:37:36,391 --> 01:37:39,383
Look at me, I'm well and fit,

750
01:37:39,507 --> 01:37:41,070
aren't I?

751
01:37:43,468 --> 01:37:44,782
Yes.

752
01:37:51,255 --> 01:37:53,298
But then...

753
01:38:00,012 --> 01:38:02,534
It's more comfortable,
Father, that's all.

754
01:38:02,649 --> 01:38:06,370
But I...I want to show off
our soldier boy

755
01:38:06,485 --> 01:38:08,643
to the fellows at Max's.

756
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,155
You look well, Paul. Fit.
War agrees with you, eh?

757
01:38:27,229 --> 01:38:30,950
- I suppose, in a way.
- Have a cigar.

758
01:38:31,075 --> 01:38:35,266
If you're old enough
to kill Frenchmen, you can smoke.

759
01:38:35,391 --> 01:38:38,747
Hans, another beer
for our young warrior.

760
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:42,219
What's the spirit like out there?
Excellent, eh?

761
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:49,537
The enemy has many reserves,
Mr Hollerstein.

762
01:38:52,893 --> 01:38:55,291
You only see your little sector,

763
01:38:58,887 --> 01:39:04,046
The important thing is
the breakthrough, here in Flanders.

764
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:06,569
This is Frenchie, this is us.

765
01:39:06,569 --> 01:39:10,760
We have to come found
the Belgian side and fam through.

766
01:39:10,884 --> 01:39:12,678
There's no other way.

767
01:39:12,803 --> 01:39:16,514
Before we beat them
on the Hindenburg line?

768
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,036
It is borders that are important.

769
01:39:19,161 --> 01:39:20,715
You're quite wrong.

770
01:39:20,839 --> 01:39:24,311
Good soldiers never stay
planted on borders like turnips...

771
01:39:35,464 --> 01:39:41,583
You're lying to me, Paul.
I know you are.

772
01:39:42,782 --> 01:39:45,055
I swear to you, he died instantly.

773
01:39:46,254 --> 01:39:49,850
- You promised he wouldn't get hurt.
- Mrs Kemmerich, I...

774
01:39:49,975 --> 01:39:53,812
Why are you living
when he is dead? Why?

775
01:39:53,936 --> 01:39:55,854
What right have you?

776
01:40:13,117 --> 01:40:14,795
Tell me again.

777
01:40:18,276 --> 01:40:20,674
Did you...see it?

778
01:40:20,674 --> 01:40:24,270
Yes, I was fight there next to him.

779
01:40:24,395 --> 01:40:27,512
He died at once. He never suffered.

780
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:35,424
I know that
you're trying to comfort me,

781
01:40:43,701 --> 01:40:45,619
I want to know the...

782
01:40:45,733 --> 01:40:48,256
I want the truth!

783
01:40:51,373 --> 01:40:53,291
I have to hear it!

784
01:40:55,324 --> 01:40:58,806
Mrs Kemmerich, I promise,
that's exactly how it happened.

785
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:06,958
His face was quite calm.

786
01:41:07,082 --> 01:41:10,314
- Do you swear it?
- Yes.

787
01:41:11,397 --> 01:41:14,035
By everything that is sacred to you?

788
01:41:22,187 --> 01:41:25,188
By everything that is sacred to me.

789
01:41:25,188 --> 01:41:27,222
He died at once.

790
01:41:44,254 --> 01:41:46,287
May I never come back...

791
01:41:47,736 --> 01:41:50,133
if he wasn't killed instantly.

792
01:41:56,242 --> 01:41:59,004
Carry that lesson to the front lines

793
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,478
You are dismissed.

794
01:42:26,586 --> 01:42:27,785
Baumer.

795
01:42:32,216 --> 01:42:34,134
Paul Baumer!

796
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:37,979
Baumer!

797
01:42:39,533 --> 01:42:43,130
- Here, have a cigarette.
- No, thank you.

798
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:47,206
You still haven't picked up
the habit. Well, that's good.

799
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:51,521
It's not a good habit
but a man has to have vices.

800
01:42:51,646 --> 01:42:55,722
How does it go? All work
and no play... You remember?

801
01:42:57,045 --> 01:43:01,841
How is it, Baumer?
How...how is the spirit?

802
01:43:01,956 --> 01:43:04,113
Excellent, eh? Excellent?

803
01:43:05,312 --> 01:43:06,750
Behm is dead.

804
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:08,314
Behm?

805
01:43:09,273 --> 01:43:11,076
Josef Behm.

806
01:43:11,076 --> 01:43:14,433
Oh. You know,
I didn't think he would enlist.

807
01:43:14,548 --> 01:43:16,466
But he went.

808
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:19,104
Yes...

809
01:43:19,228 --> 01:43:21,625
Kemmerich is dead, too.

810
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:23,064
I was told.

811
01:43:23,179 --> 01:43:26,066
And Kropp has lost a leg.

812
01:43:26,181 --> 01:43:29,422
Er... Oh, Albert Kropp, yes.

813
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:36,615
I don't know about all the others. We
were separated, but Leer's alive

814
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:39,493
and Müller is alive and I'm alive.

815
01:43:39,607 --> 01:43:41,526
I'm glad to hear that.

816
01:43:43,693 --> 01:43:45,726
Tell them...

817
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:51,720
Tell them I'm proud to have
taught them to be good Germans.

818
01:43:51,845 --> 01:43:57,359
To know that you have all
done your duty by the Fatherland.

819
01:43:59,642 --> 01:44:02,279
Imagine how that makes me feel?

820
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:06,950
You were a good class. Good boys.

821
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,347
Good boys all.

822
01:44:09,347 --> 01:44:13,184
- And this class?
- This lot?

823
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:21,825
They haven't got your spirit, Baumer.

824
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:24,577
Not the Iron Youth, eh?

825
01:44:24,702 --> 01:44:26,255
Mm? I'm sorry...?

826
01:44:26,255 --> 01:44:28,059
No Iron Heroes?

827
01:44:28,173 --> 01:44:29,497
Just boys.

828
01:44:31,051 --> 01:44:32,854
Want to play.

829
01:44:32,978 --> 01:44:34,532
Laugh.

830
01:44:35,491 --> 01:44:37,054
To stay alive.

831
01:44:40,286 --> 01:44:41,725
Only boys.

832
01:45:23,941 --> 01:45:26,579
Mother, it's late.
You should be asleep.

833
01:45:26,579 --> 01:45:29,936
Did I wake you, dear? I'm sorry.

834
01:45:29,936 --> 01:45:32,208
You'll catch cold here. Go sleep.

835
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:34,366
I can sleep enough later.

836
01:45:36,284 --> 01:45:39,171
Are you very much afraid?

837
01:45:41,329 --> 01:45:42,643
No.

838
01:45:42,768 --> 01:45:48,397
I'd like to tell you to be on your
guard against the women in France.

839
01:45:48,521 --> 01:45:50,200
They're no good.

840
01:45:52,233 --> 01:45:56,673
Mother, where we are
there aren't any women.

841
01:45:59,915 --> 01:46:04,470
- Yes, I will.
- I pray for you every day.

842
01:46:04,585 --> 01:46:06,504
I know, Mother.

843
01:46:08,546 --> 01:46:12,382
Perhaps you can get a job
that is not so dangerous?

844
01:46:13,582 --> 01:46:17,062
Perhaps in the cookhouse.
That could be easily done.

845
01:46:17,062 --> 01:46:20,534
Do it, then,
and if others say anything...

846
01:46:20,659 --> 01:46:22,817
I won't let that bother me.

847
01:46:22,817 --> 01:46:25,330
Now, you must sleep,
Mother. Come on.

848
01:46:56,988 --> 01:47:02,627
'Mother, I used to live in this
room. All my things are here.

849
01:47:02,751 --> 01:47:04,909
'All my books, my beloved books,

850
01:47:05,024 --> 01:47:09,225
'but they no longer speak to me
as they used to,

851
01:47:09,225 --> 01:47:13,416
'for I am not what I was
when I lived here.

852
01:47:13,541 --> 01:47:18,336
'I am a soldier. My business
is not reading, it is killing.

853
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:21,453
'My knowledge of life
is limited to death,

854
01:47:21,577 --> 01:47:25,289
'and I know now
I should never have come back.

855
01:47:29,729 --> 01:47:31,887
'because it has no meaning.

856
01:47:31,887 --> 01:47:36,088
'My companions at the front
are the only truth I know.

857
01:47:40,403 --> 01:47:44,594
'I depend on them
and I depend on nothing ese.

858
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:48,430
'Mother,
it's a terrible thing to say,

859
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:52,996
'but I feel I am now going back
to my real home.'

860
01:48:10,498 --> 01:48:11,937
Paul!

861
01:48:21,891 --> 01:48:25,728
- Well, you're back, my boy.
- Yes, I'm back.

862
01:48:28,489 --> 01:48:32,326
You're a fool.
I'm glad to see you, anyway.

863
01:48:32,441 --> 01:48:34,838
I'm glad to see you, too, Kat.

864
01:48:37,715 --> 01:48:40,238
They're getting
younger and younger, Paul.

865
01:48:43,834 --> 01:48:47,316
Our hands'll be full
just taking care of them.

866
01:48:55,468 --> 01:48:58,105
Hey! The old deserter's back!

867
01:49:01,586 --> 01:49:04,579
- How was your leave?
- Good. Where's Müller?

868
01:49:09,019 --> 01:49:12,260
- When was it?
- A week ago.

869
01:49:15,732 --> 01:49:17,170
Was it quick?

870
01:49:21,966 --> 01:49:26,166
Shrapnel in the stomach.
He lasted two hours.

871
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:38,758
Damn!

872
01:49:58,064 --> 01:49:59,502
Lieutenant!

873
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:27,679
Lieutenant!

874
01:50:27,804 --> 01:50:31,880
Leer! No, leave him!
He's gone! He's gone!

875
01:50:31,995 --> 01:50:34,642
Leer! Come back!

876
01:50:50,466 --> 01:50:52,029
God!

877
01:50:52,144 --> 01:50:55,865
Oh, GOD! GOD! GOD! GOD!

878
01:51:42,513 --> 01:51:45,266
- Ready! Charge!
- Let's go!

879
01:52:09,126 --> 01:52:13,691
'There isn't much. We are all
going hungry. We are all tired.

880
01:52:13,806 --> 01:52:17,528
'We are all hopeless.
But the war goes on.'

881
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,917
Why don't they just let it end?

882
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:24,480
Ah, who knows?

883
01:52:27,233 --> 01:52:28,796
We're finished.

884
01:52:33,477 --> 01:52:36,833
Our bread is nothing but sawdust.

885
01:52:39,710 --> 01:52:43,067
You see anybody that hasn't got
dysentery and colic?

886
01:52:43,182 --> 01:52:46,059
Artillery's burned out.

887
01:52:46,184 --> 01:52:48,581
Damned barres are so worn down

888
01:52:58,891 --> 01:53:02,727
Too many guns, tanks.
Now the Americans are pouring in.

889
01:53:04,175 --> 01:53:08,126
New guns, aeroplanes, fresh troops.

890
01:53:25,514 --> 01:53:27,077
Lie still.

891
01:53:28,151 --> 01:53:31,028
- Just as it's ending!
- Be quiet!

892
01:53:31,028 --> 01:53:34,030
- After four years.
- Stretcher!

893
01:53:34,145 --> 01:53:37,147
- Stretcher bearer!
- Just as it's ending.

894
01:53:38,586 --> 01:53:40,744
It's all right. Just lie still.

895
01:53:40,868 --> 01:53:43,745
Don't worry,
it looks like a clean wound.

896
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:45,663
Just hold on.

897
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:52,252
Stretcher!

898
01:53:52,376 --> 01:53:54,535
Can you stand up?

899
01:53:54,659 --> 01:53:56,577
You can get up?

900
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:01,248
Come on. Come on! Come on!

901
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:10,608
I've got to carry you.

902
01:54:11,682 --> 01:54:13,485
Ready? Up.

903
01:54:35,303 --> 01:54:36,742
Sorry.

904
01:54:36,742 --> 01:54:39,379
That's all right. That's all right.

905
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:51,377
We gotta keep going. You ready?

906
01:54:51,492 --> 01:54:53,170
Yes, yes.

907
01:54:54,849 --> 01:54:56,412
Come on.

908
01:55:00,133 --> 01:55:02,530
- You got it?
- I'll try.

909
01:55:06,481 --> 01:55:08,640
- No.
- No, I'll try.

910
01:55:08,764 --> 01:55:11,162
No, you can't. It's all right.

911
01:56:15,072 --> 01:56:16,511
No.

912
01:56:18,313 --> 01:56:22,754
It's his shin, he's fainted.

913
01:56:24,308 --> 01:56:26,590
C'mon, Kat, come on.

914
01:56:47,095 --> 01:56:49,367
He was talking.

915
01:56:53,683 --> 01:56:55,611
Ten minutes ago.

916
01:57:01,241 --> 01:57:03,159
We were talking.

917
01:57:25,581 --> 01:57:29,906
'It is Autumn.
We wait for the end.

918

'We wait for the Armistice.

919
01:57:32,783 --> 01:57:34,701
'We wait for peace.'

01:57:54,361 --> 01:57:57,124
'a bullet in the head.

'and now Detering is gone.
