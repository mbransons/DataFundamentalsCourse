1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,257
- Yes, Whiteacre?
- I'm sure you're not aware of it, Captain,

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,733
but Private Ackerman has been badly beaten
fighting the biggest men in the company.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,453
Yes?

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,933
He's been seriously hurt, and I'm sure
now that you know, you'll wanna stop it.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,378
You're quite right, Whiteacre. If I knew,
I would stop it. I'd be obliged to stop it.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,179
- But then, I don't know.
- You know now, sir.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,579
What's the matter with you? Ackerman
isn't one of those rich Broadway producers

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,653
you have to suck around.
He's just a dogface. Get some sense.

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,728
I think you'll have to stop it, sir.

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,415
You know, the colonel had a phone call
about you out of channels from Washington.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,491
Very much out of channels.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,652
To transfer you to Special Service in London.

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,016
It's up to me to approve it or disapprove it.

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,694
I still think you'll have to stop it, sir.

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,089
I know the colonel would.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,251
All right, Whiteacre. I'll spell it out for you.

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,892
You go to the colonel,
and you won't get your transfer.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,974
And you'll have to be five times more soldier
than any man in this outfitjust to stay alive.

19
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,051
Now get out.

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,692
Rickett.

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,290
Get rid of him. Today.

22
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,174
- Send his papers through.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,930
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
This makes three beatings in a row.

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,170
Almost had him, though.

25
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,051
- How'd he look?
- Who? Cowley?

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,335
- Yeah.
- Better than you do.

27
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,170
What are you tryin' to prove?

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,734
- Nothin'.
- Well, why are you tryin' to kill yourself?

29
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,773
I like to fight.

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,613
I'm tired of watchin' you
get your brains beat out.

31
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,375
Look, if you fight Brailsford,
you're on your own.

32
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,849
- Sorry.
- That's OK. That's all right.

33
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,129
- Michael, I can lick Brailsford.
- Well, I don't care.

34
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,529
It's important to me. It's the last fight.

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,339
- This whole thing has got you crazy.
- Maybe.

36
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,174
- Oh, excuse me, men.
- Yes, Lieutenant?

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,730
- I'd like to speak with Ackerman.
- Certainly, sir.

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,530
You'll be around?

39
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,212
Mm-hm.

40
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,812
Cigarette?

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,012
Thanks.

42
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,811
Oh. Sorry.

43
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,896
Ackerman, I've been watching the sick book.

44
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,293
You're the most... accident-prone soldier
in the entire United States infantry.

45
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,371
I'm careless, sir.

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,608
Saturday nights in town, you're careless.

47
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,137
Every Saturday night. On weekdays, you're
on the roughest obstacle course in the post.

48
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,372
Without stubbing your toe.
Now, why don't you level with me?

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,614
I know you're fighting. I think I know why.

50
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,140
This is something for the colonel to handle.

51
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,211
Just gimme the word.

52
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,370
Besides, you're getting licked.
You're no good to us punch-drunk.

53
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,011
I appreciate it, Lieutenant.
Thank you. But this is my business.

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,452
- Whiteacre?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,010
I been looking all over for you.
Your orders just came through.

56
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,455
You got 40 minutes
to make the train to Washington.

57
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,132
Thanks.

58
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,810
He's all yours, medic.

59
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,175
Don't fall! Don't fall! Don't fall! Don't fall!

60
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,251
Don't fall!

61
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,891
Come on.

62
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,570
Leave it alone.

63
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,855
You'll get dirt in it.

64
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,771
Ready! Hut!

65
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,817
Ready! Hut!

66
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,697
Ready! Hut!

67
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,409
- Attention, roll call. Abbott.
- Here.

68
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,058
- Acaro.
- Here.

69
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,937
Ackerman.

70
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,692
Ackerman!

71
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,129
Any of you men seen Ackerman?

72
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,610
Abbott, did Ackerman
sleep in his bunk last night?

73
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,728
I don't know, sir. I didn't notice.

74
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,851
Donnelly, did he?

75
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,931
Eyes front, you.

76
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,171
Well, Donnelly?

77
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,533
I don't know, sir.
He's at the opposite end of the barracks.

78
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,978
I warn you, men, I want
a straight answer from the next soldier.

79
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,492
Cowley!

80
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,096
No, sir.

81
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,535
He didn't.

82
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,815
Nobody deserts this company!

83
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,496
When they find him, I don't want him
in the stockade, I want him right back here.

84
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,775
- He's mine.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,093
Gentlemen.

86
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,535
Your attention, please.

87
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,770
The briefing will begin.

88
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,331
Gentlemen, I will come
directly and frankly to the point.

89
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,849
You have heard rumours
that our position is deteriorating.

90
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,692
It is.

91
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,012
An American fleet of tremendous strength
is believed to be approaching Tunisia

92
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,335
to attack us from the rear. The British are
about to launch a massive frontal offensive.

93
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,208
The Resistance in Stalingrad
has bled our fuel and ammunition

94
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,734
in unexpected quantities.

95
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,493
We must therefore
prepare for a breakthrough.

96
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,891
For the present,
this information is for you only.

97
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,210
Air attack!

98
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,291
Dismissed.

99
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,452
- Damn you, keep awake!
- I am awake.

100
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,612
Well, stay that way! Talk to me!

101
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,054
See that you don't fall asleep.

102
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,295
What do you want me to say?

103
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,769
Anything, anything. Just talk!

104
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,132
All right.

105
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,778
How far... how far do we have to go now?

106
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,612
About... 400 kilometres more.

107
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,210
Seven hours.

108
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,015
I think I must sleep.

109
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,689
If you sleep, you'll wake up
in a British prison camp. Come on! Talk!

110
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,289
I wish I was in the mountains,

111
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,972
where it is so cool and peaceful in the snow.

112
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,452
So wonderful to feel the wind in your face.

113
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,531
Clean and nice.

114
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,378
And I like the smell of smoke in the winter,

115
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,339
coming from the wood... in the fireplaces.

116
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,378
Talk about something else!
Talk about women!

117
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,451
Women! Women!

118
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,013
I have a French girl - Françoise -
and I think I can love her.

119
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,532
- Was she beautiful?
- Yes, she was beautiful.

120
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,088
And I wish I was with her,

121
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,375
and not on this motorcycle,

122
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,809
because I am... I am sick of Africa.

123
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,298
And I am sick of the great German army.

124
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,649
- And I am sick of doing my duty!
- I should have shot you.

125
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,979
What?

126
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,133
I said I should have shot you!
I ought to shoot you now!

127
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,178
You'd better learn to drive this first.

128
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,969
You will destroy us!
Men like you poison an army.

129
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,218
You let discipline slip a little one day, a little
more the next day, and soon you are nothing!

130
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,610
You are not able to fight at all!
I should have shot you!

131
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,772
- <i>Ja, </i> why didn't you shoot me, then?
- Because I was an idiot!

132
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,251
Yes! You recognise that you are...
you are still infected

133
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,695
with decent human feelings.

134
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,692
- Oh, shut up!
- And you hate that in yourself, don't you?!

135
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,248
- Shut up! Shut up!
- You hate that...

136
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,772
Hello.

137
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,171
I wanna kiss you.

138
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,815
Why didn't you tell me?

139
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,411
I couldn't.

140
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,209
Besides, there's a law
against harbouring deserters.

141
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,496
You're not a deserter. The army lawyer
told me you gave yourself up.

142
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,131
Are you all right?

143
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,259
Yes.

144
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,452
Noah...

145
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,898
you know what they're asking me to do?

146
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,738
Sure. Sure.

147
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,575
The lawyer said if you
go back to your old company,

148
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,010
you won't go to prison.

149
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,977
Mm-hm.

150
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,133
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do.
You do what you have to.

151
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,451
Stand up.

152
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,651
Stand up.

153
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,454
Honey! How long is it?

154
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,371
- What?
- How long is it?

155
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,619
- Five months.
- Five months!

156
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,418
Why didn't you tell me?

157
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,451
I could've written you, I guess.
I... I had to work this out myself.

158
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,058
The doctor said I should
stay in bed for a while.

159
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,176
I did.

160
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,854
I guess that's why I didn't write you.

161
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,414
I wanted to make sure it'd be all right.

162
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,169
I don't want this to influence you
one way or the other.

163
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,851
Are you glad?

164
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,131
It's wonderful.

165
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,618
Absolutely... wonderful!

166
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,895
Time's up.

167
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,132
Don't worry about me.
I'm going back home. Don't worry at all.

168
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,171
I'm not worried.

169
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,691
Can you imagine?!

170
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,894
Listen.

171
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,577
Go to the lawyer and tell him I'll go...
anyplace they wanna send me.

172
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,651
- All right, soldier.
- OK?

173
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,851
I love you.

174
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,369
Not only are you a disgrace, but your actions

175
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,056
have caused a black mark to be made against
this company and against me personally.

176
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,700
I'm gonna see that you erase that black mark.

177
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,693
I'm gonna make a soldier out of you
if I have to break you in half to do it.

178
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,372
Yes, sir.

179
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,372
You'll get no passes.
You'll be on KP every day for the next week.

180
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,299
Also, you'll have the same cot
and the same men around you.

181
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,056
You'll have to make sure any punishments
handed out to them aren't caused by you.

182
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,131
Yes, sir.

183
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,010
Now get out of here. I don't want
to see you in this room again.

184
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,295
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

185
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,575
- <i> Captain. </i>
- Yes?

186
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,573
<i>This is Major Price. The colonel</i>
<i>requests that you report to his office. </i>

187
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,855
I'll be right there, Major.

188
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,895
You wished to see me, sir?

189
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,974
There are many kinds of officers
that we get in a war.

190
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:50,009
Men like Green, Emerson...
and a few officers like you.

191
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,574
Fortunately, a very few like you.

192
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,851
Sometimes we find you out.
Occasionally, we don't.

193
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,255
In your case, we've been lucky.

194
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,817
I've just completed an investigation of the
reasons for Private Ackerman's behaviour.

195
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,051
- Sir, I can explain. You see...
- I hope you can.

196
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,689
I'll read you the charges that'll be brought
against you at your court martial.

197
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,977
"That said officer wilfully persecuted
Private Noah Ackerman

198
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:27,373
by ordering mass punishment of his entire
company as a means of disciplining him."

199
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,453
"By wilfully and knowingly permitting
savage beatings to be inflicted upon him

200
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,690
by members of his company."

201
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,977
"By attempting to blackmail Private Michael
Whiteacre, who interceded on his behalf."

202
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,455
Do you want me to go on?

203
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,850
I thought not. I've preferred
these charges against you,

204
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,649
and... I officially serve you with them now.

205
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,290
Hey! Hey, you guys,
I think I've just seen a ghost.

206
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,536
I don't see anything.

207
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,249
- I think it's Ackerman.
- You're crazy. He's in New York, livin' it up.

208
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,299
- It's somebody who looks like Ackerman.
- Nobody looks like Ackerman.

209
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:02,296
All right, you guys, make room for one more.
I've just found a pigeon with 20 bucks.

210
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,848
Come on, whose bet?

211
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,249
Five? You're outta your mind!

212
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,298
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Captain. May I help you?

213
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,452
Yes. Do you have
a Captain Hardenburg in this section?

214
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,930
- Yes, he's here.
- Would it be possible to see him?

215
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,534
- Are you a friend of his?
- Mm, yes.

216
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,533
- Very good. He's right in there. Go right in.
- Thank you.

217
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,653
- Captain Hardenburg?
- Is that you, Diestl?

218
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:02,138
Yes, sir. I was just released from my hospital
this afternoon, and I came to say goodbye.

219
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,256
That's very nice of you.

220
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,651
- Well, are you feeling any better, sir?
- <i>Ja. </i>

221
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,731
- Better each day.
- Good.

222
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,255
But they tell me I will be here for six months.

223
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,377
Six months? Well, I'm sorry
that it will be so long for you.

224
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,416
Why sorry?

225
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,697
It gives me the opportunity
to think of the future.

226
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,573
I plan to go into politics.

227
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,093
Oh, yes.

228
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,776
My face will be a reminder of what
I have given for the fatherland.

229
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,008
It will stand me in good stead...
with our audiences at public meetings.

230
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,411
Well...

231
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,775
You know, sir, that... they do
remarkable things nowadays with...

232
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,420
Yes, remarkable. Remarkable.

233
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,538
Glass eyes, plastic noses.

234
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,929
Reconstructed cheekbones.

235
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:05,297
I have written to Gretchen in this
kind of detail, to prepare her for it,

236
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,091
and she has assured me she's proud of me,
and it will make no difference.

237
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,292
Gretchen... is the name of my wife.

238
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,411
Yes, I know.

239
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,090
How do you know?

240
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,938
Ah, yes, you delivered a package for me.

241
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,208
She is quite handsome. Isn't she?

242
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,014
Yes, sir, she's quite handsome.

243
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,898
She will be very useful to my career.

244
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,496
What I would like you to do for me is...
visit her again,

245
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,571
to reassure her.

246
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,853
I know it's a great deal to ask,

247
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,728
to speak for a man to his wife
under these circumstances,

248
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:59,610
but I want her to hear from
a third party that I am... salvageable.

249
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,529
Yes, l-l-I will be glad to do that.

250
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,694
Thank you. Thank you, Diestl.

251
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,492
Now...

252
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,371
come closer.

253
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,771
Yes, sir.

254
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,171
Are we alone?

255
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,578
- Yes, except for...
- Yes, yes. It's all right.

256
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,578
I have one more favour to ask of you.

257
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,008
I want you to bring me a bayonet.

258
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,979
- A bayonet?
- Yes, yes. A bayonet.

259
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,571
- Well, I think...
- What is the matter with you?!

260
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,696
Not for me.

261
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,771
For him.

262
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,930
He has no hands left. Or anything left.

263
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,818
He wants to die. I have promised him.

264
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,298
He whispers to me
when we are alone.

265
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,211
And he can hear.

266
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,457
He's a watchmaker... in Nuremberg.

267
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,008
Specialist for stopwatches.

268
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,092
He has three children. And he wants to die.

269
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,891
Where is my hand?

270
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,293
Approximately over his heart.

271
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,972
Good.

272
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,332
That's where I will place the bayonet.

273
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,412
We have practised it every night for a week.

274
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,294
Come back tonight with the bayonet.

275
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,376
Diestl, will you bring me the bayonet?

276
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,611
Yes, sir.

277
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,731
Goodbye, Diestl.

278
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,296
Goodbye, sir.

279
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,454
Yes?

280
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,735
It's, uh, Christian Diestl.

281
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,892
Who?

282
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,971
Christian Diestl.

283
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,815
Hello.

284
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,494
Oh. Lieutenant.

285
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,494
- Yes.
- Come in.

286
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,335
How are you?

287
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,615
I'm all right. And you?

288
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,819
Forgive me. I must look awful,
but I haven't slept for so many weeks.

289
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,289
We've had so many air raids.

290
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,097
Come in. Excuse me.

291
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,694
They come over two, three times a night.

292
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,376
You can't imagine what it's like.

293
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,612
The soldiers at the front
would strike under such conditions.

294
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,852
I mean it. There's no heat, no light.

295
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,371
Oh yes.

296
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,540
I remember. Sit down.

297
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,451
Thank you.

298
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,088
Did you bring any food from Russia?

299
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,172
- Africa.
- Of course. My husband's company.

300
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,329
<i>Ja. </i>

301
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,454
All I have left is some kümmel.

302
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,809
No, no. Thanks.

303
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,889
Do you hear from your husband?

304
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,091
He killed himself.

305
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,288
- He what?
- He killed himself.

306
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,210
With a bayonet.

307
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,689
I have the letter somewhere.

308
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,771
He asked me to come here
and speak to you for him.

309
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,929
Perhaps it's just as well.

310
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,094
He wanted to come back here.

311
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,696
Naturally, I didn't encourage him.

312
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,216
I spent a whole night
composing the most tactful letter.

313
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,693
I told him, of course, he would be better off
in some permanent veterans' hospital.

314
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:01,212
What are you doing now? For heaven's sake,
Christian, be a little realistic.

315
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,497
You people are getting stranger and stranger.

316
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,851
Stay a little while.

317
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,809
Maybe I can find some vodka.

318
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,814
I'll make myself pretty for you.

319
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,897
Christian?

320
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,216
Christian!

321
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,419
- Brandt.
- Christian, how wonderful to see you again!

322
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,648
It's good to see you, Brandt.

323
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,379
- Oh no!
- I can't believe it!

324
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,655
It was bad, huh?

325
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,494
No. They moved us around
a little bit, but, you know, it's...

326
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,859
Listen, now-what's the matter with you,
being so near the front, Brandt? What... huh?

327
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,898
You know me. It was a mistake in the orders.

328
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,369
What are you doing here?
Are you stationed here?

329
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,419
No, I am waiting for transportation.
I'm trying to get to Paris.

330
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,650
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

331
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,451
- I see you are a captain from taking pictures.
- It's an outrage. I should be a major.

332
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,692
You've no idea how glad I am to see you.

333
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,738
I'll take that,
and bring us some glasses, please.

334
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,290
I've been here for two days
waiting for somebody to go to Paris.

335
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,578
- Listen, what are you doing in Paris, Brandt?
- My headquarters are there.

336
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,415
This is your headquarters-with
blonde hair, who likes goose liver?

337
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,857
- Yeah, yeah. That's the one.
- In other words, you have no orders?

338
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,692
- Only a desire.
- <i>Ja, ja. </i>

339
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,932
Look, Christian, I've also managed to
acquire a little French car all my own.

340
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,056
- This follows naturally.
- Yes, but look.

341
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,419
I wouldn't last an hour before somebody
requisitioned it, but you have combat orders.

342
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,620
- With you, there'd be no questions asked.
- You have this car here, just...

343
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,168
<i>Ja, </i> just near here, in a little stable.

344
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,889
- Well, we go now, we take the car.
- All right, let's go.

345
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,419
Why don't you have dinner
with Simone and me tonight, huh?

346
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,856
That would be very nice, Brandt,
but I think I must report.

347
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,216
Oh, report in the morning.
You need some rest.

348
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,290
- Brandt, do you ever see Françoise?
- Why, of course.

349
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,689
She's living with Simone now.

350
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,139
- She is living with Simone?
- She has been for more than a month.

351
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,135
Brandt, would you like to have dinner
with Françoise and me tonight?

352
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,814
Very nice. We'd be delighted.

353
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,378
Simone!

354
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,257
Simone?

355
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,932
Simone!

356
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,852
Simone.

357
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,532
Darling.

358
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,051
It's been forever.

359
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,251
Hello, Françoise.

360
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,972
Hello.

361
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,139
Come in.

362
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,975
I'm an American officer!

363
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,975
Oh, my wonderful friends, I want to thank you
for this beautiful night. I love you for it.

364
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,972
And now, I'd like to make a little toast.

365
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,053
Farewell, Captain Brandt
of the army of the Third Reich!

366
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,054
You're drunk, darling. Say good night.

367
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,859
No, no, no, no. Christian understands me.

368
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,378
Good night, Captain Brandt.
Tomorrow you awaken to your new life:

369
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,532
Monsieur Brandt, citizen of the worid.

370
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,498
Isn't he funny? He has such ideals.

371
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,299
Sit down, Simone. Sit down for a minute.

372
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,138
Christian, I... I know you don't approve,
but listen to me for a minute.

373
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:17,772
Tell me, are we civilised human beings,
or are we wild beasts?

374
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,570
A human being knows when he has lost,
and he tries to save himself.

375
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,255
When you are put into the army,
you are expected to risk your life,

376
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,810
but you are not expected
to just throw it away.

377
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,731
After all,

378
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,811
in any war, Christian,

379
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,971
after all the arms and the legs
have been... blown off,

380
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:48,378
it doesn't really matter,
because nothing really changes.

381
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,578
Good night... my dear friend.

382
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,372
Françoise...

383
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,450
be good to him, <i>ja... </i>

384
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,492
because he is the best of the best.

385
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,969
- All right, all right.
- <i>Ja. </i>

386
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,691
Come on.

387
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,577
Christian.

388
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,579
You...

389
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,615
You won't report him?

390
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,691
No.

391
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,451
Thank you.

392
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,895
You're not the same.

393
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,330
When you are...

394
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,615
When you are in a hole...

395
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,617
filled with your own excrement
for days on end,

396
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,576
and when you see the faces
and the bodies of the men you've killed,

397
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,571
you change.

398
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,099
And when you're out there like that,

399
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,932
when you have to live with death every day...

400
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,891
for so long...

401
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,892
you have to keep something in front of you,
or you would go insane.

402
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,451
And so I was...

403
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,215
I was always afraid that...

404
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,009
I had just invented you.

405
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,970
Oh, but I am real.

406
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,849
Yes.

407
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,252
Christian...

408
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,290
please stay.

409
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,452
There isn't anything for you to fight for.

410
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,735
There never really was.

411
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,210
Christian...

412
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,098
you're not the golden warrior any more.

413
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,811
And soon...

414
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,699
you will be just another refugee.

415
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,610
Don't throw this away.

416
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,212
Please.

417
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,010
Don't throw this away.

418
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,689
I think...

419
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,089
I think I've come too far.

420
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,411
What are you staring at?

421
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,651
The faces of the generals. I don't like 'em.

422
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,294
If there is one thing I cannot stand

423
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,977
it's enlisted men, with their air
of injured moral superiority.

424
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,895
They don't look like they could lead
you up the walls of a German fortress.

425
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,054
Don't you worry, honey. They're not gonna
lead you anyplace outside of a London bar.

426
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,176
- Let's not start that again.
- All right.

427
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,131
Go on, dear.

428
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,614
Whoops. Here comes another big man.

429
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,011
No, no, no. Sit down, sit down, soldier.
How are you, Margaret?

430
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,534
I'm all right, Sam. So far.

431
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,453
They are a little early tonight.

432
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,499
Oh. Private Whiteacre,
I'd like you to meet General Rockland.

433
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,777
Sam, huh? Nice to know you, sir.

434
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,455
Thank you. Come on over to the bar.
Bring your friend.

435
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,849
In a little while. Thank you, Sam.

436
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,133
How long's this been goin' on?

437
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,814
- Wouldn't you like to know!
- And a general, too.

438
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,897
Johnny One-Note.

439
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,369
Always criticising officers.

440
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,419
Always turning down promotions.
Why do you insist on staying a private?

441
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,858
Guilt, I guess. You know, Dr Freud
would say I'm punishing myself

442
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,135
because I'm stayin' outta combat.

443
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,974
Because I'm letting Noah Ackerman
do my fighting for me.

444
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,894
- If you wanna personalise it.
- Well, then, get into it.

445
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,859
Stop feeling so guilty.
It's getting a little sickening.

446
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,893
I'd rather be guilty than dead.

447
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,451
Go on, see Sam.

448
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:29,094
These things get any closer, I'll probably
chicken out and make a spectacle of myself.

449
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,171
Go on, see Sam!

450
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,171
Go on!

451
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,251
- You would, too!
- Let me go.

452
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,651
You stay here.

453
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,776
What are you tryin' to do, get yourself killed?

454
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,054
General, will you do somethin' for me?

455
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,856
Will you?

456
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,615
- I dunno. What is it?
- Can you send me back to my old outfit?

457
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,578
- Where are they?
- They're fighting in Normandy.

458
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,494
Well, I suppose so. Why don't you just
put in a request through channels?

459
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,413
I don't wanna wait that long.

460
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,491
All right.

461
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,815
- Give me your name and your serial number.
- Yes, sir.

462
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,488
Thank you, General.

463
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,571
Thank you.

464
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,380
Well, now you've done it!

465
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,338
We're practically in a foxhole right now.

466
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,456
- That's what you wanted, isn't it?
- Michael, you stupid idiot.

467
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,375
That isn't what I wanted. You don't
have to get killed to keep me loving you.

468
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,055
I won't get killed. Believe me,
I'll have the deepest foxhole

469
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,608
and the biggest helmet in the whole infantry.

470
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,578
No you won't. I'll talk to him.

471
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,128
Don't. Margaret, please.

472
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,970
Come here.

473
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,888
Now let that be a lesson to you.

474
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,855
Margaret, I... I have to do this.

475
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,138
I know I'll chicken out afterwards,
but... by that time it'll be too late.

476
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,093
I'm... I'm scared.

477
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,377
- Ah, don't be scared.
- I am. I wish I hadn't...

478
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,011
I'll come back. I have to come back.
How else can I marry you?

479
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,299
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

480
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,371
Here it is.

481
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,889
<i> Also, the mail may be slow, </i>
<i>and I don't want you to worry. </i>

482
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,768
<i>I can't tell you where I am, </i>
<i>because the censors wouldn't like it. </i>

483
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,251
If it's not too private, could you read it to us?

484
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,932
Yeah.

485
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,814
"The photograph was wonderful."

486
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,894
"I'm delighted with my little girl,
and I can see that she is a fine child,

487
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,618
straight of limb, quick of mind."

488
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,534
"I promise to return to both of you
with a whole body and a whole heart,

489
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,770
no matter what happens."

490
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,089
"I shall return to tell her stories at bedtime,

491
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,776
to feed her spinach, and to teach her
how to drink milk out of a glass."

492
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,530
"To take her out in the park, and tell her
the names of the animals in the zoo."

493
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,892
"To explain to her why
she must not hit little boys...

494
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,932
and why she must love her mother
as much as her father does."

495
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,051
<i> Write me... my darling. </i>

496
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,973
<i>Write me. Write to me, please. </i>

497
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,854
<i>Write me. Love... </i>

498
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,412
"Noah."

499
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,690
They're gettin' close.

500
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,739
Look, I want no firing-no matter
what happens-till they move up.

501
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,130
Oh, no. No shootin'. We're only
artillery observers, you know.

502
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,054
I can hear the old man. "You boys
go on ahead, see what we have to clear out."

503
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,689
"It's easy. It's like takin' a walk
on a peaceful Sunday mornin'."

504
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,817
What are they doin' out there
on a peaceful Sunday mornin'?

505
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,050
Bless you.

506
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,654
Mother. Mother!

507
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,934
Mother!

508
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,979
Here they come. Put your guns on 'em
and make it count. Now!

509
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,416
Don't bunch up down there!

510
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,969
Grenade!

511
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,095
No sense in putting it off.
We're French-fried if we stay here.

512
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:52,059
We'll have a few minutes before they
reorganise. Who wants to go first?

513
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:57,168
We'll leave by twos and threes. We'II...
dissolve the detail in twos and threes.

514
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,139
No need to tell you to be careful.
Well, who's goin' first?

515
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,969
Look, when you get through the Germans...

516
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,018
Well, I wish I could tell you
where our lines are.

517
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,218
But... don't expose yourself
till it's absolutely necessary.

518
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,497
You don't wanna get shot by your own men.

519
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,610
Somebody better go now.

520
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,613
- All right.
- Yeah.

521
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,251
I'll go too.

522
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,292
Ohhh!

523
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,689
What's... what's the matter?

524
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,900
It's all right. It's all right.

525
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,572
OK?

526
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,490
- What you doin'?
- What do you mean? Get your stuff off.

527
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,299
- Not me. I can't swim.
- Well I can't swim either.

528
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,338
- It can't be too deep.
- There's Krauts all around us.

529
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,856
- We'll sit here and wait for 'em.
- Those are our guys across there.

530
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,330
The minute we hit that water,
they'll spray us like sittin' ducks.

531
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,378
- Shut up and get outta your gear.
- I'm takin' off nothin'.

532
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,020
- You can't stay...
- I don't know what you're doin',

533
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,137
but I'm not doin' it with you.
You're nuts. I can't swim!

534
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,415
- Shut up!
- Get outta here.

535
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,578
- I'm ready.
- Let's go. I'll go first.

536
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,172
It's gettin' deep.

537
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:55,493
Wait... wait a second. Wait a second.
Just dog-paddle. Take it easy. OK?

538
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,696
Hold on to me.

539
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,771
Just hold on.

540
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,250
Hey! Not here. Not here.

541
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,930
Hey! Hey! Here.

542
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,130
Is it bad?

543
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,211
- No?
- No.

544
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,211
Don't try to move.

545
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,732
Hey!

546
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,412
Hey, you guys!

547
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,695
Cut it out! Cut it out!

548
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,054
Hey! Will you quit shootin'?!

549
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,171
We're Company C - Charlie Company.
There's only two of us.

550
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,251
And he's wounded.

551
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,096
Gimme a hand!

552
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,455
Gimme a hand, will ya?!

553
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:48,249
- You got dog tags?
- Sure I got dog tags!

554
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,578
- Your name?
- Ackerman. 3974287.

555
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,059
OK?

556
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,132
All right, keep your shirt on. We're coming.

557
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,736
Take it easy, now. Be careful.
Easy. Easy.

558
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,852
Thanks.

559
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:13,450
This here's Red Dog Four. Yeah, a couple
of guys from C Company just come up.

560
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,656
Ackerman and, uh...

561
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,459
- Burnecker.
- Burnecker. Burnecker's wounded.

562
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,419
Ackerman ain't got no clothes.
Better get some up here.

563
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,856
Ask him if, uh, Lieutenant Green showed up.

564
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,651
What about Green?

565
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,578
Uh-huh.

566
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,651
Yeah, I got ya.

567
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,572
Yeah, they're all OK. They just barely made it.

568
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,410
How was it out there?

569
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,695
- They're sendin' up some dry clothes for you.
- I found some schnapps. Get you warm.

570
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,649
Hm.

571
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,655
Huh?

572
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,811
Oh, Michael.

573
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,136
How'd you get here?

574
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,897
I have a friend that's a general. I'm pretty big
behind the lines, you know. Put these on.

575
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,451
What's the matter?

576
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,297
They're still, uh... Hey, uh...

577
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,490
Could one of you, uh...

578
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:17,888
pass the word down the line
to hold fire for, like, ten, fifteen minutes?

579
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,732
What gives?

580
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,698
There's a guy over there
that we left over there.

581
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,692
Vernon, go down the line
and tell those trigger-happy Joes

582
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,250
if they see a derričre in the canal,
it's one of ours.

583
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,769
- Who's out there?
- Cowley.

584
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,128
Oh, Cowley. Good.

585
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,496
- Yeah. Except he can't swim.
- Even better.

586
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,492
Look, you don't owe him anything. Nothing.

587
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,571
No, I don't.

588
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,451
You've just been out there.
There are plenty of other guys.

589
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,213
How about you, son? You look fat and sassy.

590
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,768
Wait a minute. I just got here.

591
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,329
Besides, I'm a coward.

592
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,852
Cowley?

593
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,739
Cowley?

594
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,811
What do you want?

595
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:58,496
- Come on, let's go.
- Will you leave me alone?!

596
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,730
Cowley, it's not deep.

597
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,415
Damn you, it's not deep!

598
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,898
The guys are waiting for us. Now come on!

599
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,135
No. No, I'm not goin'.

600
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,654
- OK.
- Wait.

601
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,091
All right, Noah?

602
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,729
- I'd like to speak with your commandant.
- <i>Ja, Kapitän. </i>

603
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,215
Enter, <i>Kapitän. </i>

604
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,691
- Yes?
- I was wondering if you had some food, sir.

605
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,978
We have no food. We have already
been cleaned out by deserters.

606
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,855
I am not a deserter.

607
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:49,138
My company has defected, I am without
command, and I have not eaten in two days.

608
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:55,338
Forgive me, Captain. Sit down,
pour yourself some coffee.

609
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:07,336
It's a relief to find someone who still
has some sense of discipline left.

610
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,253
How close are the Americans?

611
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,572
Well, I think they are - I don't know -
five minutes or five hours.

612
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,532
- I'm sorry, that's all that's left.
- Thank you.

613
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:21,088
Everything is gone.

614
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,298
Colonels and generals... passing by,
snatching the food out of my hands.

615
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,497
Throwing away their uniforms.

616
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:32,016
Unbelievable. My men are running, too.

617
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:36,013
This organisation is falling apart
in front of my eyes.

618
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,534
I'm sorry.

619
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,292
Are you hurt?

620
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,938
No.

621
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,773
I can see you had a bad time.

622
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,816
Well, so did I.

623
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,573
I have my wounds, too,
even if you don't see them.

624
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,254
Running a concentration camp is not a picnic.

625
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:56,697
With all the gas chambers, target ranges,
doctors with their experiments.

626
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,216
I had an extermination quota
of 1500 people a day.

627
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,895
Jews, Poles, Russians, French.
Political prisoners.

628
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,938
And I had only 260 men to do it.

629
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:12,014
I managed it. Then they sent memorandums,
inspectors-running, shouting.

630
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,250
In Auschwitz, they kill 20,000 a day.

631
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,257
I know who it is. It's Berlin again.

632
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,535
For the fourth time today.

633
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,296
Yes?

634
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,419
Yes.

635
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,255
Very near. A few miles.

636
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:38,209
I told you. All right, I didn't tell you.
I told whoever it was that called.

637
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,728
I have ten men left.
How can I kill everybody in the camp?

638
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:49,135
Don't you understand? The equipment
is not working. Nothing is working.

639
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:55,531
I don't care what they did in Buchenwald!
I am here alone, and I have no personnel left!

640
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:05,100
You know what this is, this phone call? They
want me to kill every man, woman and child

641
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,648
in the camp before the Americans get here.

642
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,731
6,000 people.

643
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:18,856
And the man who asked me to do this...
this same man will walk the streets, free.

644
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,819
And they will come to him, the Americans,
the Russians, and he will say

645
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,733
"I never heard of concentration camps."

646
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:32,055
He will say there never was a national policy
to kill 12 million people-the SS invented it.

647
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,009
Nobody in the government ever heard of it.

648
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,410
I'll be here, trying to explain to the Americans.

649
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,492
You know, the Americans may not
understand what they see here.

650
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:48,969
They may not know that a German officer -
our kind of officer -

651
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,528
does what he's ordered to do.

652
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,092
Well...

653
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:02,058
We at least know... what is important.

654
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:08,135
The courage to stay and face the enemy,
and the honour to be able to say

655
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,018
"I have done my duty for the fatherland."

656
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,891
What's the matter?

657
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,653
My God...

658
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:54,009
Captain, this is the mayor of the town
we came through on our way up here.

659
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,773
He says he can send
a gang of civilians in to help us.

660
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:01,012
As I was telling the sergeant, we have heard
that some of your most important generals

661
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,534
and newspapermen are on the way up here.

662
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:08,091
I can provide you with my townspeople,
who will help you to clean up this place so...

663
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,533
Yes?

664
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,611
Excuse me.

665
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:16,130
My name is Joseph Silverson. I am a rabbi.

666
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,458
Yes?

667
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,534
I do not wish to annoy the officer,
but I have a request to make.

668
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,415
Yes, what is it?

669
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,650
Thousands have died here.

670
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,254
More will die tonight, tomorrow.

671
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,174
I'm sorry, Rabbi, we're doing all we can.

672
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,455
Of course. I know that.

673
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,215
There's nothing to be done for them.

674
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:46,053
Nothing material. We understand that.

675
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,608
All efforts must be for the living.

676
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:54,213
What I am asking for is a... luxury.

677
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,252
Yes?

678
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,731
I ask to be permitted to collect all of us -

679
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:05,812
the living and... those without hope -

680
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:12,173
and hold a religious service. A service for
the dead, who have come to their end here.

681
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,536
There has never been
a religious service for us in this place.

682
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:24,694
Captain, I don't like to intrude. I understand
why the rabbi has made this request,

683
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,975
but this is not the time for it.

684
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,451
I'm a European. I understand things
perhaps the captain doesn't understand.

685
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:36,250
If you allow this gentleman to hold
the services, I'm obliged to warn you...

686
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:40,654
there will be riots,
the other prisoners will not stand for it,

687
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:44,813
and the generals who are coming
will not like what they see.

688
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:56,208
The, uh, the other prisoners will not stand
for it? And the generals will not like it?

689
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,690
That's a fact. I guarantee it.

690
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,048
I'm going to guarantee something myself.

691
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:17,056
I'm going to guarantee that you...
you hold your services.

692
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:22,770
I will also guarantee that machine guns
will be set up on the roofs of the buildings,

693
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:26,136
and anyone who attempts
to interfere with those services

694
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,529
will be fired upon by those machine guns.

695
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:36,017
And further, I guarantee that if you ever come
into this place again, I will break your neck.

696
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,371
That is all.

697
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,655
Thank you very much... sir.

698
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:11,617
Ackerman, you're not needed around here.
Go take a walk outside the camp.

699
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,971
Thank you, sir.

700
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,451
Whiteacre.

701
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,130
How do you feel?

702
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,211
Fine. Fine.

703
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,931
I never... Did you ever
imagine it could be like that?

704
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,011
No.

705
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,019
My father's brother died in one of those...

706
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,575
- Did you see them?
- The ovens?

707
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,651
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

708
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,254
Did I ever tell you about my father?

709
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:08,217
No.

710
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:16,853
When that guy started to talk to Green...
I could've gone and blown my brains out.

711
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,010
- I felt the same way.
- And then...

712
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:25,617
- Green said "I guarantee. I guarantee."
- I got a lotta hope for Captain Green.

713
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:31,569
You know what? When this war's over,
Green is gonna be running the worid.

714
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,652
There are millions of him. Millions!

715
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:40,575
They're human beings! There are millions
of them! They're gonna run the worid!

716
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,131
Kraut!

717
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,209
Hey!

718
