1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,685
<i>1840.
America's lifeline is the sea.</i>

3
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,103
<i>Railroads are almost unknown.</i>

4
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,903
<i>Only the great sailing ships
link the busy states of New Engiand...</i>

5
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:56,527
<i>with the rich Mississippi Valley.</i>

6
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,660
<i>The sea, and the sea alone,
makes America one nation.</i>

7
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,404
<i>But along this lane of commerce...</i>

8
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:07,701
<i>lie the shark-like teeth of the Florida Keys...</i>

9
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:11,992
<i>where savage hurricanes
come screaming out of the Caribbean...</i>

10
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:15,255
<i>to drive tail ships
onto the destroying shoals.</i>

11
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:19,135
<i>Here, storm-riding men
and frail schooners...</i>

12
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,711
<i>the salvage masters of Key West...</i>

13
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,557
<i>stand guard beside America's lifeline.</i>

14
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:28,685
<i>They reap the harvest of the wild wind...</i>

15
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:33,689
<i>fighting the hurricanes to save lives
and cargo from the wrecked vesseis.</i>

16
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,851
<i>But tales
of great salvage profits...</i>

17
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:41,397
<i>have drawn reckless men
to this dangerous harvest...</i>

18
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,781
<i>spawn of the seven seas.</i>

19
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:47,786
<i>So among Florida's
heroic salvage masters...</i>

20
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,120
<i>appear lawless captains...</i>

21
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,250
<i>who plot to destroy, for their own profit...</i>

22
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:56,253
<i>the great ships they are pledged to save.</i>

23
00:02:57,047 --> 00:03:00,831
<i>America's very future on the sea
is being fought for...</i>

24
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:03,630
<i>beside the roaring reefs of Key West.</i>

25
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:28,197
You men! Lash Capt. Stuart
to the mizzen fife rail!

26
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:34,579
Breakers off the starboard bow!

27
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:41,709
Lay forward and rig a preventer stay!
I'll take the wheel.

28
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,041
Get going! Go on!

29
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,186
Breakers dead ahead!

30
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:27,330
I ain't through.
I'm gonna take out another ship.

31
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:29,749
While you're still a young man.

32
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,802
Hark, ye!

33
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:36,135
Who's hollering?
I don't know.

34
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:38,716
Quiet. It sounds to me like...

35
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,893
Wreck ashore!
Wreck ashore, men!

36
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:54,145
Sam! Loose your forestay sail
and your mainsail and stand by.

37
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,858
Better move fast, Capt. Phil,
or Cutler will beat us to our share again.

38
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:01,119
I'll be there. You single up.
Get the boss. We'll be ready.

39
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:04,704
Where did she take the bottom?
She won't be long in that sea!

40
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,701
<i>Claiborne men, board!</i>

41
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:11,584
What vessel struck?
Don't know. She'll soon break up.

42
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:14,337
<i>What reef?
Claiborne men, look alive!</i>

43
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:18,969
Be careful, Pa. And bring me back a
nice piece of black silk for a Sunday dress.

44
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:26,345
Ahoy, Loxi!

45
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:34,731
Loxi Claiborne! You come right down
from that widow's walk.

46
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,607
You'll blow away up there, Cousin Loxi.

47
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,448
Can you sight her, Loxi?

48
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:45,406
She's on Sambo Key, driven hard!

49
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:47,362
What ship?

50
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:50,541
<i>Looks like the Jubilee of the Devereaux line.</i>

51
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,827
<i>She's breaking up fast, too.</i>

52
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:58,007
<i>Jubilee! Why her cargo's dead rich.
Come on, gal!</i>

53
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:01,420
LOXl: I'm worried about the crew.
Crew?

54
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:05,712
Consarn it!
Ain't no money salvaging the crew!

55
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,466
You're not going
out to that wreck!

56
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,220
Mercy! Stay covered.

57
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,177
LOXl: Bring along my petty skirt,
Drusilla honey.

58
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:17,104
Loxi, once and for all...
LOXl: I'm not going anyplace, hardly!

59
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:19,862
Maum Maria, help me rig for wrecking.

60
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:23,646
Now, Miss Loxi, you know what way
your mama thinks...

61
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:26,232
about you going after them wrecks.

62
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:31,573
Trying to make a lady out of her
is keeping me wore to a shadow.

63
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:33,704
- Give me my sea boots.
- Your mama say...

64
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:34,954
Loxi, I forbid you.

65
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:38,162
The Cutlers won't pick the bones
of this wreck, if I can help it.

66
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,543
- How will you stop them?
- We'll be broke if I don't.

67
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:43,502
What's Drusilla going to tell the family
back in Havana?

68
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:45,918
We can't run a salvage business
without salvage.

69
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,633
Loxi, I think you're so brave
going out to that wreck.

70
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,593
Brave! Fiddle-de-dee! She's just pigheaded.

71
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:54,684
- Lf only your father were alive!
- Throw me that southwester.

72
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,640
If Father were alive,
I wouldn't be running the business.

73
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:58,845
Loxi!

74
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:04,775
You found your anchor?
Land o' Goshen! Crank on, will you?

75
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,938
LOXl: I'm coming, Capt. Phil.

76
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:10,401
Loxi, I worry every time you go a-wrecking.

77
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:12,616
The hurricane's all over, Mummy.

78
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:15,028
Your mama say you ain't going!

79
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,824
Maybe we better let her go.

80
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:36,683
<i>Oh, the Nellie B's your packet
and you're far away from home</i>

81
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,843
<i>And it breaks your back to tack it</i>

82
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:40,810
Larboard, half a pint!

83
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:43,434
<i>Haui away
Just the same as me</i>

84
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:46,774
<i>For you're nothing but
a packet rat</i>

85
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:50,355
Tail onto that foresheet and trim her!
Aye, Capt. Phil.

86
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,653
<i>Aboard the Nellie B</i>

87
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,025
<i>Bread and water for your supper
when you board the Nellie B</i>

88
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,616
<i>The Moro's fallen astern, Capt. Phil.
We'll speak the wreck ahead of them all!</i>

89
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,460
- Wreck ho!
- Where away?

90
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:11,124
Dead ahead on Sambo Key!

91
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,719
<i>And your blood runs down
her scuppers in the briny, shiny</i>

92
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,847
There she lies.

93
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,852
<i>LOXl: The Falcon's lying close by.</i>

94
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,645
LOXl: The Cutlers are there before us!
Them forecastle rats must've known.

95
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,948
No man alive can foretell a wreck.
Unless he plans it himself.

96
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:39,197
We'll get no part of her rich cargo.

97
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,905
Cutler and his brother are boarding her now.

98
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:57,634
- Come on. Get aboard.
- King, look there.

99
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:02,467
<i>Put a shot across the bow of the Claiborne.</i>

100
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:06,256
- Yeah. We salvage this wreck!
- Aye, aye, sir!

101
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,764
Ready? Turn your pipe into that touchhole.

102
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:17,018
Can't even shoot straight.

103
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:20,610
- Ram that pirate. Ram her, Capt. Phil!
- And sink us both?

104
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:24,363
- Land of love, gal! Heave to. Lower the dory.
- Aye, sir.

105
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:30,248
- That stopped them.
- Get to work on that cargo, Dan.

106
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:33,119
<i>You Falcon men, break open that hatch.</i>

107
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:39,419
I'm in command here.
Capt. Stuart's taking a little rest.

108
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,253
- We got hurt men aboard.
- We'll move them later.

109
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:46,511
- You'll move them now!
- My brother said later!

110
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:51,095
We're going to save
this cargo for you, boys...

111
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:53,391
whether you like it or not.

112
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:55,726
Forward!

113
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:59,977
- Have any trouble with the skipper?
- He never knew what hit him.

114
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:06,688
- I'm expecting a fat bit for this, Mr. Cutler.
- You'll be taken care of, Widgeon.

115
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,859
Here. Sign this.

116
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:14,238
Pull her close! Hang on, Loxi.

117
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,292
<i>Ahoy, Cutler!</i>

118
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,372
We demand salvage shares in this vessel.

119
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:25,461
I'm taking charge of the cargo.
You take the crew.

120
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,385
Ain't no pay for that,
you benighted blowfish!

121
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,885
- Take them anyway. He'd let them drown!
- All right!

122
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:34,303
Jump into the mizzen
and rig the crow jack yard.

123
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:36,515
Aye, Dan.
Make it lively!

124
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:40,018
Get off me, you filthy...

125
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:45,603
Quick! Give me an oar.
The poor little fellow.

126
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:49,977
<i>Grab it! There's a squid out there!</i>

127
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,401
Poor fellow.

128
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:58,867
Here, take him. Set me aboard that hulk.

129
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:00,332
Now, Loxi!

130
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:12,082
Has the water got to that cargo?

131
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,419
Who pitched that little monkey into the sea?

132
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:17,134
Get off this deck,
or there'll be two of you in the sea.

133
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:20,427
You weaselling crimp!
I'll coil your rope for you!

134
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:21,894
Over the side, you men!

135
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:24,979
<i>What'll we do? Walk?
The Claiborne's waiting.</i>

136
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,689
- Who's that?
- The skipper.

137
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:29,526
You better get him off
before we start swinging cargo.

138
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,354
Get your men off this ship!

139
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:34,150
Larboard to helm! Larboard your...

140
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,276
Don't fret your head
till it's in one piece again.

141
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,241
Widgeon! Where's that...

142
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:42,578
Take it easy.
The salvage boats are standing by.

143
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,084
Lie still. They're taking off the crew now.

144
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:53,089
- Who are you? What're you doing here?
- I'll be here just as long as you need me.

145
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:55,926
I hope that'll be a long time.

146
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,848
Bringing the man in here, that's charity.

147
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:05,720
But bringing the ape, that's obnoxious.

148
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,681
Fifty percent? Why, that's piracy.

149
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:11,347
It's legal. Your mate signed it.

150
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,932
<i>The Jubilee was 15 months at sea.</i>

151
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:18,482
You salvaged her cargo in a few hours
and want 50%.

152
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,774
And get it.
If your owners break you, come to me.

153
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,699
I'll show you how to own
your own ship in a year.

154
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:28,824
Yes, and hang him, too. I brung your duffel.

155
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,161
Where would your cargos be
if it weren't for me and my ships?

156
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,123
- Maybe still afloat.
- What do you mean, you little cultch?

157
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,045
I'll bust you in...
LOXl: No. The door's over there, Mr. Cutler.

158
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,758
And it's open.

159
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,802
- You're not a good loser, Miss Loxi.
- Not to you, Mr. Cutler.

160
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,049
Here, drink this.

161
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,768
If your owners do break you, Capt. Stuart,
look me up.

162
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,764
Smoking in the house.

163
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:56,725
Now go on, drink it.

164
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:04,439
I sworn to man, that feller
would sink his own grandmother...

165
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:06,406
to salvage the gold in her teeth.

166
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:09,778
You're not saying he pushed that reef
in front of my ship, are you?

167
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,362
No. I'm saying he's a bad Yankee.

168
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:14,243
I'm a good one.

169
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,119
Where'd you get that mate, Widgeon?

170
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:19,963
We took him on in Havana.
I see.

171
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:25,087
If I thought that wreck was planned...

172
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,928
I'd make a topsail out of Cutler's hide.

173
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:32,390
You hark to me, sonny.
The 10 years I've been at Key West...

174
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:35,926
sailing master for the Claiborne family,
I have seen them go broke...

175
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,558
flatter than the shadow of a clam.

176
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:41,477
Same as all the other
honest salvage masters.

177
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:45,647
Run out by thieves and cutthroats,
and that shark Cutler's their boss.

178
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:49,438
No more bilge talk.
Now, you up anchor and let him rest.

179
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:51,739
What you need is some nourishment.

180
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,035
Smells like burning hair.

181
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:01,994
You fold that right back!

182
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:06,745
Yes, quite a lady's man, ain't he?

183
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:20,303
I'm afraid Bananas
is only used to forecastles.

184
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:23,137
Is this your room?

185
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,018
Yes. Does it bother you being
in a lady's bedroom?

186
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:27,686
Drusilla's in the guest room.

187
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:31,609
Bother me? Took me a long time
to be sure I wasn't in heaven.

188
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:35,611
She ain't no angel.
Here. Come down from there.

189
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,202
- How many sugars?
- Three.

190
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,420
I feel like a hulk,
putting you to so much trouble.

191
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:48,749
Shucks.

192
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,712
You stop looking at me and eat your dinner.

193
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:56,418
I was just remembering
where I saw you before.

194
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:58,796
- Under a southwester?
- No.

195
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:04,185
You sort of came out of that storm
like one of Mother Carey's chickens...

196
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,725
only, you were good luck for me.

197
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:09,470
Loxi!
Your mama's calling.

198
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:13,694
Maum Maria, see he cleans his plate.
I'll be back soon as I can.

199
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:18,065
You got no call to hurry.
He ain't going nowhere.

200
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,318
Scat! I'm feeding this one.

201
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:34,878
He's mighty handsome, Cousin Loxi.

202
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:38,381
A man like that would rather lose his life
than his ship.

203
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:41,006
Why do you all hate Mr. Cutler so?

204
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:44,381
LOXl: Because he needs hanging a little.
Cousin Loxi?

205
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:50,519
- His brother's different, isn't he?
- Different front name, that's all.

206
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:55,729
What are you studying about Dan Cutler for?

207
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:58,902
I'm not. Really, I'm not.

208
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,150
I thought girls raised in Havana
never even looked at men...

209
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,699
till they were married to them.

210
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,701
Drusilla, is Loxi there?
LOXl: I'm coming, Mummy.

211
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:12,324
I'll be up in a minute.

212
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,517
Dan!

213
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:46,321
What do you want?

214
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:53,157
Hello, you lovely little carrot-top.

215
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:56,240
Dan, I was so afraid.

216
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,412
I'm afraid every time I take you in my arms.

217
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01,163
Why?

218
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,543
Because I want to crush
the life out of you.

219
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,924
When I'm in your arms,
I don't care what they say about you.

220
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:17,307
I'll love you always, Dan. Always.

221
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:28,487
<i>Going to lay down
this heavy load</i>

222
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:33,817
<i>By and by
By and by</i>

223
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,071
<i>Going to lay down this heavy load</i>

224
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:43,910
<i>By and by
By and by</i>

225
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:48,922
<i>Time will come
when my troubies are gone</i>

226
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:53,670
<i>No more toting these sacks of corn</i>

227
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:58,472
- You left your spyglass at our house.
- Loxi.

228
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:05,139
I was coming over to thank your mother for...

229
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:07,804
Mother's making a heap of to-do
about you and me.

230
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,687
They're planning to ship me off
to visit Aunt Henrietta.

231
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:14,395
<i>I got my orders, too.
I sail tonight on the Arcturus.</i>

232
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,147
A month at sea and then Charleston.

233
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:21,867
- Charleston?
- For a showdown with Steve Tolliver.

234
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:26,494
You'll be in Charleston?
Why, that's where Aunt Henrietta...

235
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,752
LOXl: Oh...

236
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:30,330
LOXl: Who's Steve Tolliver?

237
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:34,335
He drips lace,
and leads the Charleston quadrilles.

238
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:35,539
What?

239
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:38,125
He's sea lawyer for Devereaux and Company.

240
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,304
He loves me about as much
as the devil loves holy water.

241
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:44,972
- But he doesn't sound very dangerous.
- He wouldn't be...

242
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,927
except he holds the power of influence
with old Commodore Devereaux.

243
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:51,939
But Commodore Devereaux's
fair and square.

244
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:54,986
He's fair and square, but old.

245
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:59,812
If you keep doing that,
I'm going to fall right into them.

246
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,984
Trying to frighten me?

247
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:07,235
You know, Loxi,
there's only three things I want out of life.

248
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:12,412
<i>One is to command the Southern Cross,
a steam.</i>

249
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:16,332
- Steam.
- Don't turn up your pretty nose at steam.

250
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,462
It's the future of the seas...

251
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:21,965
when calms and gales and fog
won't mean a thing.

252
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,929
<i>And with the Southern Cross under me,
I'd get my second wish...</i>

253
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:29,886
because the man who commands in steam...

254
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:33,562
will be the head of
Devereaux and Company someday.

255
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:36,102
Will you have to wear a stovepipe hat, Jack?

256
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,895
Steve Tolliver looks all right in one.

257
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,111
He means to be
head of the company himself.

258
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:44,521
I was the one man in his way.

259
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:46,774
<i>Now that I've lost the Jubilee...</i>

260
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:50,367
he'll crack down with everything he's got
to break me.

261
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:53,241
Break you? That's a man-size job.

262
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:56,283
I promise you, he won't do it.

263
00:19:57,711 --> 00:20:01,329
I've found something in these Keys
worth fighting for.

264
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,048
Nights on watch, I'll see you like this, Loxi...

265
00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:08,713
with your hair catching fire in the sunset...

266
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,380
and that look in your eyes 10 fathoms deep.

267
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:19,432
What was the third thing you wanted, Jack?

268
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,818
Think I'm going to say "you," don't you?

269
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:26,227
- Aren't you?
- Yes.

270
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:32,485
You're in my blood, Loxi, same as the sea.
I'm coming back for you.

271
00:20:32,702 --> 00:20:36,534
You won't have to come back.
I'll be waiting for you in Charleston.

272
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:38,496
They're not going to break you...

273
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,789
<i>and you're gonna have the Southern Cross.</i>

274
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:45,253
- You're starting to tell my future?
- It's our future, Jack.

275
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,779
Of course, Commodore Devereaux,
you need a mighty experienced captain...

276
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:19,327
<i>to navigate a fine ship like
the Southern Cross, steam and all that.</i>

277
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,746
That ain't got no elegance.
You are in Charleston.

278
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:26,124
Ladies don't tell gentlemen. They ask them.

279
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,585
It was really you I came up to see,
Commodore Devereaux.

280
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:31,250
All the way from Key West.

281
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,172
There's Mrs. Mottram's house.
Aunt Henrietta's waiting on the porch.

282
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,930
- Button that mitten.
- Do you suppose it'll work?

283
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:40,385
Do you suppose he'll listen
about Capt. Jack?

284
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:41,588
Of course, child.

285
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:46,261
Only just don't leave your right hand
know what your left feet is doing.

286
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:52,484
<i>'Twill bring me back</i>

287
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:56,483
<i>one golden hour</i>

288
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,529
<i>Through many</i>

289
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:04,077
<i>Through many a weary year</i>

290
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:08,156
<i>i may not</i>

291
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,453
<i>to the world impart</i>

292
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:17,963
<i>A tale of me and you apart</i>

293
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:20,921
- Elizabeth.
- Henrietta, this is mighty pleasant.

294
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:23,633
This is my little niece Loxi from Key West.

295
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:26,510
- This is her cousin Drusilla.
- What lovely girls.

296
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,684
- Mrs. Mottram, I...
- Ivy is singing.

297
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,396
<i>Save for the little faded flower</i>

298
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:42,150
<i>But oh how fondly dear</i>

299
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,199
Which do you think
is Commodore Devereaux?

300
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:48,449
He must be here.

301
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,487
But I never saw a less seagoing run of shad
in my whole life.

302
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,875
<i>Through many</i>

303
00:22:55,544 --> 00:23:00,621
<i>Through many a weary year</i>

304
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,389
Lovely, Ivy. So tender.

305
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,430
I want you to meet Loxi Claiborne,
Drusilla Alston.

306
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:19,768
- This is our own Ivy Devereaux.
- Commodore Devereaux's daughter.

307
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,065
Charleston must seem quite different
to you after the wild life of Key West.

308
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,941
I can see you two will be the best of friends.

309
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,989
- This is Capt. Carruthers.
- Charmed.

310
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,029
Miss Loxi Claiborne, Mr. Stephen Tolliver.

311
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:36,119
Come, Drusilla. I want you
to meet some of our Charleston beaus.

312
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,998
Charmed, Miss Loxi.

313
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,294
This is Romulus.

314
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,714
Miss Loxi Claiborne, Mr. Romulus Tolliver.

315
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,008
Charmed, Miss Loxi.

316
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,461
Speaks pointedly good English,
don't you think?

317
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,591
Considering his mother
spoke nothing but Gaelic.

318
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,637
I saw it... I saw your lips move.

319
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,476
She's lovely, isn't she?

320
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,566
What a wonderful pair of performing dogs.

321
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:11,948
I've heard a lot about Steve Tolliver.

322
00:24:12,408 --> 00:24:13,866
LOXl: In Key West.

323
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:16,450
Well, we're flattered.

324
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:19,658
You're jumping to conclusions, Mr. Tolliver.

325
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:22,499
Now, who's been telling you stories
about Steve?

326
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:26,202
One of the finest men I ever met,
Capt. Jack Stuart.

327
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:30,122
That's rather a sore subject with Romulus.

328
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:33,217
You see, Capt. Stuart sat on Romulus once.

329
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:36,171
And he weighs 200 pounds.

330
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:42,143
Ivy, I'd be happy if you'd introduce me
to your father.

331
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,184
I'm sorry. My father's not here.

332
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:47,936
Commodore is very ill. His doctor
won't allow him out of the house.

333
00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:49,816
Then who runs the Devereaux Company?

334
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:53,104
I do, lady,
with a little help from Steve.

335
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:54,853
You run it?

336
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:56,323
Loxi, dear...

337
00:24:56,407 --> 00:25:00,570
your aunt speaks of nothing but those
charming Florida ballads you sing so well.

338
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:04,528
- Won't you...
- I couldn't. Why, I just couldn't!

339
00:25:04,623 --> 00:25:07,079
Romulus and I are very partial to sentiment.

340
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:10,287
Attention, everybody, please.

341
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:14,079
Miss Claiborne is going to sing
one of those sweet ballads of Key West.

342
00:25:14,174 --> 00:25:15,632
Charming.

343
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:22,305
Steve and I would love to hear one of those
soft moonlight-on-the-sea songs.

344
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,556
Perhaps a breath of Key West
would be refreshing...

345
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,137
to all of us.

346
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:34,767
<i>Oh, the Nellie B's your packet</i>

347
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,983
<i>When you're far away from home</i>

348
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,946
<i>And it breaks your back to tack it
O'er the briny, shiny foam</i>

349
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:46,363
<i>But heave ho, haui away
Just the same as me</i>

350
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:50,494
<i>For you're just another packet rat</i>

351
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:53,454
<i>Aboard the Nellie B</i>

352
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:59,127
<i>Bread and water for your suppers
when you board the Nellie B</i>

353
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:04,008
<i>And your blood runs from her scuppers
in the briny shiny sea</i>

354
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:08,508
<i>But heave ho, haui away
Just the same as me</i>

355
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,301
<i>For you're just another packet rat</i>

356
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,893
<i>Aboard the Nellie B</i>

357
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:19,313
<i>Oh, her mate he'll talk so civil</i>

358
00:26:19,402 --> 00:26:21,892
<i>But he'll rob ya in your sleep</i>

359
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:26,566
<i>There's no uglier a devil
in the briny, shiny deep</i>

360
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:29,526
<i>But heave ho, haui away</i>

361
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:32,953
- Is that Elizabeth's idea of a sweet ballad?
- Mighty salty.

362
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,618
<i>You're just another packet rat
Aboard the Nellie B</i>

363
00:26:38,294 --> 00:26:40,536
Do you sing, too?

364
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:43,831
<i>LOXl: For that galley growilng crew</i>

365
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:46,961
<i>For the bos'n is a dirty son of a</i>

366
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:48,962
<i>Shiny, briny biue!</i>

367
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:53,266
<i>So heave ho, haui away
Just the same as me</i>

368
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:56,933
<i>For you're just another packet rat</i>

369
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,226
<i>Aboard the Nellie B</i>

370
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:01,179
<i>Oh, the</i>

371
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:03,313
Loxi, please.

372
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,322
Come, Barbara.

373
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:15,453
She has a lovely voice, but...

374
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:20,030
- But, Auntie, there's still 20 more verses.
- Oh, my goodness.

375
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,584
I'd love to hear them all.

376
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:26,662
- How could you know such a song?
- I learned it from a pirate friend.

377
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:29,586
- With rings in his ears?
- In his nose.

378
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:34,003
<i>I'm afraid Loxi is a little, un peu exaltée!</i>

379
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:36,670
I find her exaltation most charming.

380
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:39,470
May I hear the rest of the song soon?

381
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:41,644
I hope so.

382
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,323
It's just hopeless.

383
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,158
Making a lady out of you is just hopeless.

384
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:04,331
Drusilla, I can do it.
I can do everything I came here to do.

385
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,623
Cousin Loxi,
you're playing with gunpowder.

386
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,415
I don't need Commodore Devereaux.
I don't need anybody.

387
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:12,624
Because I can wrap that Steve Tolliver
around my little finger.

388
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:14,708
And I'm going to do it.

389
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:21,052
<i>Oh, who's gonna row my honey</i>

390
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:28,267
<i>Who's going to row my honey</i>

391
00:28:29,982 --> 00:28:33,565
<i>Yes, who's going to row</i>

392
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:37,068
<i>my honey</i>

393
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:40,193
<i>When i'm</i>

394
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:44,411
<i>gone away</i>

395
00:28:44,996 --> 00:28:48,330
<i>And who's going to be</i>

396
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:52,544
<i>your true love</i>

397
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:55,875
<i>Who's going to be</i>

398
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:58,669
That's the third time
they've been together this week.

399
00:28:58,759 --> 00:28:59,838
What if...

400
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:03,509
<i>Yes, who's going to be</i>

401
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:07,179
<i>your true love</i>

402
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:10,727
<i>When i'm</i>

403
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:15,604
<i>gone away</i>

404
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,354
<i>When i'm</i>

405
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:24,694
<i>gone away</i>

406
00:29:25,576 --> 00:29:28,660
- And then what happened?
- There she'd gone telling everyone...

407
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:32,825
the bonnet had just come off the packet
from France, when they...

408
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:36,827
- Pull up, Caesar!
- What are you stopping for, Ivy?

409
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:50,048
I declare! They're together again.
That's the 13th time.

410
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:56,935
Go on, Caesar.
Yes, Miss Ivy. Giddap.

411
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:03,862
They're lovely.
Like ships in the water, aren't they?

412
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:05,439
Yes, lovely.

413
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:10,106
Steve, there's something I most especially
want to talk to you about.

414
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:14,448
- You took the words right out of my mouth.
- Romulus generally does that.

415
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:16,614
I'm a little worried about Romulus.

416
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:19,708
He's been a changed dog
ever since the Mottram tea.

417
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:23,542
<i>You're just
another packet rat Aboard the Nellie B</i>

418
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,250
Quit it, Steve.

419
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:29,176
<i>Now this is important.
It's about the Southern Cross.</i>

420
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,878
<i>What I have to say is much more important
than the Southern Cross.</i>

421
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:37,385
- But she's the newest ship in the line.
- Yes, I know. And she's steam and all.

422
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:40,394
But she's hardly fitted for a honeymoon.

423
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:43,523
Honeymoon?

424
00:30:44,984 --> 00:30:48,269
LOXl: But, Steve, you don't mean it.
Yes, I do, Loxi.

425
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:52,941
When you walked
into Mrs. Mottram's tea party...

426
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:56,033
it was like all the winds of the Caribbean.

427
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,910
I was shipwrecked at once.

428
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:02,373
But, Steve, I...

429
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:07,210
My whole life is Key West.
This is another world to me.

430
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:10,914
There's only one world, Loxi,
inhabited by two people.

431
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:16,007
I spoke to your aunt last night.

432
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:19,593
Mr. Tolliver!

433
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:26,052
Mr. Tolliver!
Here's trouble on horseback.

434
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,359
Mr. Tolliver, sir. Pardon, ma'am.

435
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:36,937
You're wanted at the counting house
at once, sir.

436
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:39,701
Commodore Devereaux
is already on his way there.

437
00:31:40,536 --> 00:31:44,485
- Has Dr. Jepson gone insane?
- Yes, sir. He asks you to come at once.

438
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:47,368
- I thought the Commodore was gravely ill.
- He is, ma'am.

439
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:50,294
<i>But the moment he heard
Capt. Jack Stuart had landed...</i>

440
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:54,541
Dr. Jepson said no mortal means
could keep the Commodore at home.

441
00:31:55,466 --> 00:31:58,716
Steve, couldn't you spare just a moment...

442
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:02,503
<i>to hear what I was going to say
about the Southern Cross?</i>

443
00:32:02,598 --> 00:32:07,509
I see the Commodore isn't the only one
interested in Capt. Stuart's arrival.

444
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,815
<i>I'll take your horse, Bixby.
You return in the carriage.</i>

445
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,227
Yes, sir.

446
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:21,151
Romulus will escort you home, Loxi.

447
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,238
But I want most of your dances
at Mrs. Mottram's ball tonight.

448
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:37,326
Good day, Mr. Stephen.

449
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,257
The Commodore was so disturbed
by the wrecks at Key West...

450
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,464
- I've twice had to bleed him.
- Stuart with him?

451
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:45,257
He is, and I fear the Commodore
will have a stroke.

452
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:48,680
Don't talk to me of barratry
when you've got no proof!

453
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:52,894
In short, sir, you were not only unconscious
when your ship struck...

454
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:55,552
- but you don't know what hit you.
- I've already said...

455
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:58,019
I'm not interested in excuses!

456
00:32:58,358 --> 00:33:00,683
I'm interested in performance.

457
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:05,903
Take up the model of your command, sir.

458
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:24,040
Put her in Rotten Row.

459
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:39,720
<i>Put her with the rest of the fine ships...</i>

460
00:33:39,814 --> 00:33:43,598
that you and your kind
have sent to rot on the bottom!

461
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,552
<i>And take your eyes off the Southern Cross.</i>

462
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:17,133
We don't want her turned into kindling!

463
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,137
- You can cat-haul me both ways...
- Choke your luff.

464
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,515
Wait outside.
I'm only asking...

465
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:23,802
I said outside!

466
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:27,846
Commodore Devereaux.
Really you mustn't. Here. Drink this.

467
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,851
I'm all right, Doctor.

468
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:33,813
That'll do you a world of good.
Here.

469
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,866
Don't coddle me. I'm no derelict.

470
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,819
You look strong as a bull, sir. Why
don't you come down first thing next week...

471
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,990
That Jack Stuart has cost us...

472
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,829
<i>It wasn't Jack Stuart
who cost us the Jubilee, sir.</i>

473
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,077
It was those Florida reefs.

474
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:53,289
Am I to remove the reefs,
or the captains who can't miss them?

475
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,543
Perhaps you should remove
the Key West pirate wreckers...

476
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,803
who swarm those reefs
like a school of killer whales.

477
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,926
And get rid of the man
who's behind them all: King Cutler.

478
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,433
Are we to go out of business
because we can't hang Cutler?

479
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,810
<i>He got 50°% of the Jubilee's cargo.</i>

480
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:13,101
Cutler or no Cutler,
I'll get my ships through!

481
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:16,100
- Lf I have to hire and fire...
- Commodore, please.

482
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:17,856
Don't coddle me.

483
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:22,943
Gentlemen, I asked Lt. Farragut
to sit with us today...

484
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:26,827
hoping the United States Navy
may give us protection...

485
00:35:26,914 --> 00:35:29,120
against Cutler and his kind.

486
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:30,951
We need some sort of protection.

487
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,830
Better than one ship a week
is piling up on those reefs.

488
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:37,586
At a cost of $5 million a year.
Yes, sir, and more.

489
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:41,754
Gentlemen, the Navy is more anxious
than you are...

490
00:35:41,845 --> 00:35:45,214
- to blast those vultures out of the Keys.
- Good.

491
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:48,342
But you present no evidence
against this man Cutler.

492
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:51,598
Give us proof of deliberate wrecking.

493
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:54,429
We'll do the rest.
Proof?

494
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:57,353
No one dares testify against Cutler.

495
00:35:57,735 --> 00:36:00,605
We sent men down there to find witnesses.

496
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:04,322
- What became of them?
- I don't know, sir.

497
00:36:04,616 --> 00:36:07,570
But I suggest that you send one man more.

498
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:11,119
- Who, for instance?
- Me, for instance.

499
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,500
You? Why, Tolliver, you wouldn't last
15 minutes in that pirate's nest.

500
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:19,503
You're a lawyer, not a gunboat.

501
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:23,882
But the gunboats won't come
until we get proof.

502
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:27,668
Gunboats or no gunboats,
if we don't stop that gang mighty soon...

503
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:30,847
the American flag
won't be at many mastheads.

504
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:34,558
- But I don't favour losing a good sea lawyer.
- Thank you.

505
00:36:34,728 --> 00:36:36,601
I know Cutler, Steve.

506
00:36:36,688 --> 00:36:40,057
You wouldn't stand any more chance
than a rat in a tar barrel.

507
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:43,767
Confound it. If they kill him,
he's not the man for the job.

508
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:45,770
That's very aptly put, sir.

509
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:48,188
Perhaps Jack Stuart
could sail south with me.

510
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:51,485
<i>The Southern Cross is refitting at Havana.
If you'll recall...</i>

511
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:55,028
<i>You'd give the Southern Cross
to the man who just lost us the Jubiiee?</i>

512
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:56,913
Gentlemen, we're in business.

513
00:36:56,998 --> 00:37:00,533
Capt. Stuart has increased the earnings
of every vessel he's commanded.

514
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:02,952
Twice he's weathered typhoons
in the China Sea.

515
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:05,963
And he's broken the record
from Rio to Martinique.

516
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:10,047
I personally don't like him,
but he gets the most out of a ship.

517
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:13,469
And then throws it away on a Florida reef.

518
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:17,339
<i>I expect to get proof that Cutler, not Stuart,
wrecked the Jubiiee.</i>

519
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,887
You expect.
Don't you?

520
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:28,484
Ormsby, order Capt. Stuart
to proceed to Key West immediately...

521
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,859
<i>as mate of the Peiican.</i>

522
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:34,608
There he'll be set ashore without pay,
to await orders.

523
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,532
- But that's unfair.
- You'll have his papers in your pocket.

524
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:42,999
<i>If you find proof that clears him,
give him the Southern Cross.</i>

525
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:49,085
- You're a great old sea lion. I'll tell him.
- You'll do nothing of the sort.

526
00:37:49,214 --> 00:37:52,665
Let him sweat on the beach,
and see how he takes it.

527
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:57,845
And my personal opinion of you
is that you're a young fool.

528
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,591
Thank you, sir.

529
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:02,798
You'll never leave Key West alive.

530
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:06,179
But I have to.
You see, I expect to be married.

531
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:08,811
Well!
What's her name?

532
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:10,274
Gentlemen.

533
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,772
You'd better hurry
before you start to Key West.

534
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:14,819
Who's the lucky girl, Steve?

535
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,089
I'm so sorry about your nice sea captain.
Father told me.

536
00:38:39,678 --> 00:38:40,958
Too bad.

537
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:51,927
Loxi, he's waiting for you
by the round window in the vestibule. Jack.

538
00:38:52,023 --> 00:38:54,514
And he looks like a thundercloud.

539
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:57,943
Capt. Carruthers, would you
want to do something for me?

540
00:38:58,028 --> 00:39:01,444
- Command me, Miss Loxi.
- Excuse me for a minute, will you, please.

541
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:23,258
I watched for your ship every single day.

542
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:26,594
That dress makes you sparkle
like sun on water.

543
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:30,383
Jack, tell me.
How did it go with the Commodore?

544
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,686
I think they've got me busted
flatter than a haddock.

545
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:38,140
But your new command.
Aren't they going to give you the...

546
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:40,024
<i>The Southern Cross?</i>

547
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:43,439
Might as well be dry-docked on the moon.

548
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:46,278
<i>They put me on the Pelican.</i>

549
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:50,827
<i>The Pelican! They're asking you
to command that old pigboat?</i>

550
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:53,449
Command? I'm second mate.

551
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:58,500
- Second mate! Why, of all the...
- We sail within the hour for Key West.

552
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:02,285
They're beaching me there till I dry-rot.

553
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:06,796
No, Jack. Nobody's going
to break us up that easy.

554
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,668
That's what he's trying to do.

555
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:14,509
- He? Who?
- Wait here for a minute, will you, please.

556
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,309
Mr. Tolliver's bitten off just a little bit more
than he's going to be able to chew.

557
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:25,693
Observe closely
this harmless-looking little object.

558
00:40:25,777 --> 00:40:28,694
- Just look here what Steve's got.
- What is it, a toothpick?

559
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,650
- No, they call them matches.
- Matches. What are they for?

560
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:35,489
I'll show you.
Carruthers, loan me the sole of your boot.

561
00:40:36,412 --> 00:40:39,828
- Goodness gracious!
- Mr. Tolliver, they're terrifying!

562
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:42,323
I'm hanged.
Do another, Steve.

563
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:44,161
I'd adore to do one, Steve.

564
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:46,708
Cousin Steve,
you do get the quaintest things.

565
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:49,798
They'll never be popular, Tolliver.
Too dangerous.

566
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:53,631
This is ours, I believe.
May I claim this, Miss Thomas?

567
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:56,504
May I have the honour?
I'd love it.

568
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:58,721
I was just coming to beg you for this dance.

569
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:00,884
LOXl: I'd like to speak to you
out on the balcony.

570
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:03,598
- Like Romeo and Juliet?
- Not exactly.

571
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:09,100
Henrietta, do you allow your niece
to wander off un-chaperoned?

572
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,693
Oh, my dear.

573
00:41:11,487 --> 00:41:14,191
I've been just bubbling over
with excitement all day.

574
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:16,986
Mr. Tolliver's asked for Loxi's hand.

575
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,989
Ettie, Loxi and Mr. Tolliver.

576
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,905
Oh, my goodness! That is news.

577
00:41:27,377 --> 00:41:29,832
Engaged? Stephen?

578
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:34,382
- To that little savage from Key West?
- She's a pretty little savage.

579
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:38,131
Moonlight and magnolias.
Just fits what I want to say to you.

580
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,090
What you've done
is the most cowardly thing I've heard of.

581
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:44,716
- Coming to the races tomorrow?
- I hope your filly wins, Col. Ogier.

582
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:46,185
Bound to.

583
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:49,053
It's vicious, and low and cruel.

584
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:52,475
You're very desirable when you're angry.

585
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:53,942
You think you're mighty clever.

586
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:56,600
Putting Jack on an old tub,
beaching him in Key West...

587
00:41:56,696 --> 00:41:58,106
Easy now, what really happened...

588
00:41:58,197 --> 00:42:01,981
What really happened was
that you saw I loved Jack Stuart.

589
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:09,160
- No, I didn't see that.
- Oh, yes, you did. And you're right.

590
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:12,250
I love him. I'll marry him.
You're stabbing him in the back...

591
00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:13,877
That's enough.

592
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:17,000
In the first place,
you're not in love with him.

593
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,925
And in the second,
I intend to marry you myself.

594
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:23,678
- Well, upon my word.
- No. Upon my word.

595
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:28,090
Do you think after knowing
one real man like Jack Stuart, just one...

596
00:42:28,183 --> 00:42:32,263
that a girl would even look
at a namby-pamby popinjay like you?

597
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,687
For the past month or more...

598
00:42:34,773 --> 00:42:38,272
you haven't seemed to have found
my ways distasteful.

599
00:42:40,153 --> 00:42:44,364
Well, if I played up to you,
it was so you wouldn't break Jack, that's all.

600
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:48,861
<i>So you'd give him command
of the Southern Cross, and no other reason.</i>

601
00:42:49,954 --> 00:42:51,152
I see.

602
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,576
What are you taking your gloves off for?

603
00:42:56,668 --> 00:43:00,666
I take it you prefer the rough ways
of your Key West pirates.

604
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:02,755
I'll be leaving now.

605
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:06,091
I'm sorry to delay you,
but there's something you need very badly.

606
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:08,217
LOXl: Don't you put your hands on me!

607
00:43:09,264 --> 00:43:12,549
Steve, stop it! How dare you! Stop it, I say!

608
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:14,428
LOXl: Let me go!

609
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:18,722
Let me up! Why you!

610
00:43:18,814 --> 00:43:19,977
Oh.

611
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:23,186
You sorry, insufferable nincompoop.

612
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:26,144
If I only had a horsewhip.

613
00:43:33,828 --> 00:43:35,572
Excuse me, please.

614
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,999
Loxi, dear child, we've just heard.
I'm so happy for you.

615
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,539
- Congratulations, Miss Loxi.
- That's nice of you.

616
00:43:42,628 --> 00:43:44,786
- We just heard, Loxi.
- When's the wedding?

617
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,878
- You're a very lucky girl.
- Charleston will be green with envy.

618
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:52,550
I shall be a good loser, Miss Loxi,
and offer Steve my congratulations.

619
00:43:52,637 --> 00:43:54,215
Mighty clever of you, Tolliver.

620
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:55,716
Thank you very much, George.

621
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:59,342
- You're shot with luck.
- You're certainly full of surprises.

622
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,345
Yes, I'm a little surprised myself.

623
00:44:01,437 --> 00:44:04,308
- Steve, it's so romantic.
- Yes, isn't it?

624
00:44:06,692 --> 00:44:08,851
Steve's such a fine catch.

625
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,112
Steve? Why...

626
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,444
Please, everyone, listen.

627
00:44:19,788 --> 00:44:24,663
LOXl: I haven't any idea how all this started,
but it isn't true what you've heard.

628
00:44:26,044 --> 00:44:29,128
You've all been very kind to me
here in Charleston.

629
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:33,958
But there's a rumour going around
this room that must be stopped right now.

630
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:37,343
I can't.
I won't have my name linked with a...

631
00:44:38,764 --> 00:44:40,887
<i>You've been very gracious to me...</i>

632
00:44:40,974 --> 00:44:44,806
congratulating me
on my engagement to be married...

633
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:48,595
and wishing me so much happiness.
I thank you all for it.

634
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,770
What's come over the child?
Why, I never in all my born days.

635
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:58,357
Yes, I am going to be married.
But I'm gonna marry a real man.

636
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:02,817
A man that can ride out a southwester
and clew up a topsail.

637
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:07,490
Not a lace-ruffled bullying jaybird like...

638
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:11,492
LOXl: Jack!

639
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:16,506
Loxi, how could...

640
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:20,632
Somebody get some water.

641
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:26,552
The skipper will marry us before we sail.

642
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:31,104
Steve's well rid of her.
Look at Steve Tolliver's face.

643
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:35,435
A hard pill for Steve to swallow.
He won't swallow it. Not Steve.

644
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,353
Lively with those winches!

645
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:42,489
Put your weight into it,
you bilge rats!

646
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:48,738
- Skipper, Miss Claiborne.
- How do you do?

647
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,657
- Maum Maria isn't here with my things yet.
- I'm sorry, we haven't...

648
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,284
Not the topsail halyards! The gaff sail lift!

649
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,838
You lumps of hardtack weevil! Join hands!

650
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,130
Excuse me, ma'am. Join hands.

651
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,516
Blood of the devil!
What're you doing up there?

652
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:14,222
You mangy hunks! Grab that halyard!

653
00:46:14,312 --> 00:46:17,266
<i>Come on, you!</i>

654
00:46:17,356 --> 00:46:19,265
Heave!

655
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,600
- Let's get on with it, Skipper.
- But we're on the wrong side.

656
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:29,365
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here... "

657
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:33,448
It's foul at the block!
Did you never walk a footrope before?

658
00:46:34,164 --> 00:46:35,574
"I require...

659
00:46:35,832 --> 00:46:37,990
"I require and charge you both... "

660
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:39,662
- Skip that part.
- All right.

661
00:46:39,752 --> 00:46:42,587
<i>Jack, do you take this woman
for your lawfui wedded wife?</i>

662
00:46:42,672 --> 00:46:44,249
- I do.
- And...

663
00:46:44,924 --> 00:46:46,797
What's her name?
Loxi.

664
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:52,926
Loxi, do you take this man for your lawful
wedded husband? And do you solemnly...

665
00:46:57,936 --> 00:47:00,059
Suffering shadrack, what's that?

666
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:02,098
Looks like a runaway!

667
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:04,810
Reckon he's boarding us?

668
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:08,649
That's what he's doing.
Let go your fore-back spring!

669
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:11,738
Say, ain't that Mister...
Get back to work!

670
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:15,484
- Somebody's coming aboard!
- Stop yawing and finish off.

671
00:47:16,078 --> 00:47:19,363
Loxi, do you take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?

672
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:21,947
No! She does not.

673
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:27,285
We've got no need of a lawyer.
I be striving to get underway.

674
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,167
I'll take you home now, Loxi.
Get off this ship.

675
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:34,550
Look at that!
Jake, somebody's fighting.

676
00:47:34,637 --> 00:47:38,681
- I've taken all I'm gonna take from you.
- Not quite.

677
00:47:41,644 --> 00:47:44,313
Ain't she a hellcat?
What's he doing?

678
00:47:44,396 --> 00:47:47,847
You can't go around bullyragging!
Put me down! Jack!

679
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:52,272
Are you crazy, Stuart?
He's the owner!

680
00:47:52,362 --> 00:47:53,524
Jack!

681
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,813
Watch out, mate,
he'll hogtie you!

682
00:47:58,534 --> 00:48:01,701
Spit in his eye, mate!
Look at that one.

683
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,611
Jack!

684
00:48:07,376 --> 00:48:08,918
There you are.

685
00:48:11,213 --> 00:48:15,127
- Shall I set her back, Mr. Tolliver?
- No, keep underway.

686
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:18,712
Aye, sir.
I'll come on another ship.

687
00:48:18,803 --> 00:48:21,757
- Don't touch me.
- Put your hand on my shoulder and relax.

688
00:48:21,848 --> 00:48:25,051
Heave ho the forestay sail.
Heave ho!

689
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:29,389
- You coward! You irresponsible ruffian.
- The water's warm, isn't it?

690
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,145
What right do you think you've got
to keep me from sailing with my husband?

691
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:35,559
He's not your husband.
You didn't say "I do. "

692
00:48:35,652 --> 00:48:38,938
What? I will right now. Jack! L...

693
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:43,447
- Jack!
- Oh, come now.

694
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:51,659
Charleston packet sure got
quality folks aboard this trip.

695
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:53,209
Let her drop.

696
00:48:53,794 --> 00:48:56,416
Load it on.
Give her more slack.

697
00:48:57,465 --> 00:49:01,711
Steady now.
Stand by the stern line.

698
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:19,479
That's him. There, with the lapdog.

699
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:26,321
Oh, my goodness, where's Drusilla?

700
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:29,943
I'll go find her. I ain't got nothing to do.

701
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:33,863
There she is, with two red pennants
and her top rigging.

702
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:38,286
- Loxi dear!
- Mummy! Hello, Mummy.

703
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:43,583
We'll come ashore
as soon as we find Drusilla.

704
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:46,541
Dan.

705
00:49:57,312 --> 00:49:58,343
Oh, Dan!

706
00:49:58,688 --> 00:50:00,348
Dan, be careful.

707
00:50:00,774 --> 00:50:02,850
Wear this for me tonight.

708
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:10,192
I reckon I didn't see what I just seen.
Come along, child.

709
00:50:10,992 --> 00:50:13,862
Capt. Phil, I brought you the most...

710
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:18,614
Where's Jack Stuart, Capt. Phil?

711
00:50:18,707 --> 00:50:23,168
He's out on a diving job.
He'll be back tonight if his hat don't leak.

712
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:30,999
Drusilla! Wherever have you been?
What a lovely shawl.

713
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,463
That's the only thing
I ain't been asked to carry.

714
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:39,559
- Have you enjoyed your trip, Mr. Tolliver?
- Yes, very pleasant indeed.

715
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:42,806
LOXl: Capt. Phil!
Sir, I want to know.

716
00:50:42,897 --> 00:50:44,806
Here, here. It's an epidemic.

717
00:50:44,898 --> 00:50:48,350
Those double topsails
get at least two knots more out of her.

718
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,477
Hurry with the cargo, boys.

719
00:50:54,574 --> 00:50:56,899
Easy. Easy there.

720
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:00,863
She handles much easier, too.

721
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:03,494
I can see Charleston in the cut of your jib.

722
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:04,911
Hold it.

723
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:08,166
Steve, look out! Jump!

724
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:25,473
Don't faint, child.
I'm as white as a sheet myself.

725
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:28,352
Romulus, we have arrived.

726
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:35,565
Clear the gangplank. Keep calm.

727
00:51:35,654 --> 00:51:38,738
That molasses came near being flavoured
with Tolliver.

728
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:43,035
LOXl: Steve, are you hurt?
We've made an impression at last.

729
00:51:43,453 --> 00:51:46,952
- I was only worried about the dog.
- We're both very grateful.

730
00:51:47,082 --> 00:51:51,542
- I hope you found your mother well.
- Look after the dog, will you, Capt. Phil.

731
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:54,411
That was a close call, my friend.

732
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:58,041
Let me congratulate you.

733
00:51:58,968 --> 00:52:01,375
Mr. Tolliver, this here's Mr. King Cutler.

734
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,878
You two men maybe heard
about one another.

735
00:52:03,972 --> 00:52:06,095
Oh, Tolliver. Well.

736
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:09,268
As one lawyer to another,
let me welcome you to Key West.

737
00:52:09,352 --> 00:52:13,350
- Thank you, that was quite a welcome.
- I saw it. Unpardonable.

738
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,598
Terrible waste of molasses.

739
00:52:17,026 --> 00:52:19,648
I didn't know you practiced law,
Mr. Cutler...

740
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,987
although I've heard of your other practices.

741
00:52:23,866 --> 00:52:28,409
It is gratifying to know that our services to
ships in distress have not gone unnoticed.

742
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:31,580
Unnoticed? I'm sure
every ship owner in the world...

743
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:34,619
would like to repay you for your efforts.

744
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,001
- Can I take you to the inn?
- Why...

745
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,087
You might go in,
but you'll never come out.

746
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:42,635
You have many talents, Mr. Tolliver.

747
00:52:42,722 --> 00:52:45,474
I hope I can make
your visit to the Keys interesting.

748
00:52:45,558 --> 00:52:48,345
I'm sure you'll do you best, Mr. Cutler.
Good day.

749
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:49,515
Good day.

750
00:52:49,604 --> 00:52:52,770
- Take good care of him, Philpott.
- Yeah.

751
00:52:52,857 --> 00:52:56,356
Take it away.
Give me a little more line.

752
00:52:56,443 --> 00:53:01,401
You happen to know some nice quiet nook
where I can sleep without any molasses?

753
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,072
Nook? I guess we can find a cranny
somewhere for you.

754
00:53:05,327 --> 00:53:09,490
Better leave word who to notify
in case there's any suddenness.

755
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:12,154
Come on.

756
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:17,411
It's port.
That's larboard to me.

757
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:19,378
When I say it's port, it's port.

758
00:53:19,465 --> 00:53:22,750
<i>- You the mate of the whaler Tyfib?
- That's right.</i>

759
00:53:22,843 --> 00:53:24,836
- Still need men?
- Yeah.

760
00:53:25,095 --> 00:53:27,800
They're scarcer than feathers on a frog.

761
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,380
- How long you going for?
- That's up to the whales.

762
00:53:30,475 --> 00:53:32,384
- About three years.
- Shut up.

763
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:36,184
- I'll sell you a couple of men.
- What's the matter with them?

764
00:53:36,272 --> 00:53:38,099
One's an able seaman.

765
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:40,646
The other will do any legal work
you might have.

766
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,736
Legal work?
You mean, like boiling blubber?

767
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,491
- When do I get them?
- Tonight. Widgeon will tell you where.

768
00:53:48,576 --> 00:53:50,651
- How much?
- $12 a head.

769
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:54,824
We'll pay when we pick them up.
Hope they both got arms.

770
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,074
Legal work!
Shut up!

771
00:54:01,046 --> 00:54:05,173
Widgeon, you and The Lamb find out
where Tolliver puts up.

772
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:09,049
Take four horn-fisted galley growlers
and pay him a little visit.

773
00:54:09,136 --> 00:54:11,462
That Charleston lawyer's
the most dangerous man...

774
00:54:11,555 --> 00:54:13,714
they've ever sent down here.

775
00:54:13,808 --> 00:54:16,594
<i>But The Lamb will know how to tame him.</i>

776
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:27,191
I wish your mama would have sent for you
before I got all your clothes unpacked.

777
00:54:27,904 --> 00:54:31,273
Maum Maria, what are the voodoo drums
beating for tonight?

778
00:54:31,658 --> 00:54:34,231
Long about dusk, I'd seen something.

779
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,610
- Couldn't be in this world, nor the next.
- Fiddlesticks.

780
00:54:38,706 --> 00:54:42,205
It weren't no fiddlesticks.
It was shaped like Miss Drusilla...

781
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:46,160
and it was traipsing along the edge
of the jungle with a demon.

782
00:54:47,464 --> 00:54:51,164
Only the demon make himself
look like Dan Cutler.

783
00:54:53,678 --> 00:54:55,006
But that's ridiculous.

784
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:58,097
Course, Miss Drusilla. The drums do that.

785
00:54:58,891 --> 00:55:01,014
Drusilla, look me in the eyes.

786
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:07,683
Loxi, I wish I didn't have to go back
to Havana tomorrow.

787
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:11,982
Are you meeting Dan Cutler on the sly?
Are you?

788
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:14,612
Drusilla, honey, he's...

789
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:17,782
You love Jack,
and you ran away to marry him.

790
00:55:18,868 --> 00:55:20,446
I love Dan.

791
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:25,281
And I'm gonna marry him,
even if I have to run away, too.

792
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:27,243
Drusilla, darling...

793
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:31,164
I'm a pretty poor one to be giving advice.

794
00:55:31,505 --> 00:55:35,834
But you go on back to Havana
and ask your mother about it first.

795
00:55:39,388 --> 00:55:41,012
Land of mercy!

796
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:46,634
I wish you'd inherited a talking dog
instead of this scratching ape.

797
00:55:46,728 --> 00:55:49,894
Mr. Tolliver's not likely to make me his heir.

798
00:55:50,106 --> 00:55:53,641
Hear them drums? Maybe he gonna be
needing an heir by morning.

799
00:55:53,734 --> 00:55:56,652
- What have you heard?
- All I know is what the darkies say.

800
00:55:56,737 --> 00:55:59,145
I suppose Steve Tolliver is in more trouble.

801
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,110
Yes, ma'am. But this here's his last trouble.

802
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:08,197
What about Steve? What is it you know?

803
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:11,374
The Lamb is getting him off
of Capt. Phil's old sponge boat...

804
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:14,246
- and selling him to a whaler.
- A whaler?

805
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,124
Maybe they get Capt. Phil, too,
if they catch him alive.

806
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:19,540
But that's terrible. We've got to warn them.

807
00:56:19,634 --> 00:56:21,875
Who you mean, "we"?

808
00:56:22,428 --> 00:56:26,342
I ain't going out into no voodoo night.
Nor none of the other darkies neither.

809
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:28,804
LOXl: You scared cats, I'll go myself.
No.

810
00:56:28,892 --> 00:56:30,007
Get me a lantern.

811
00:56:30,102 --> 00:56:32,141
Your mama would sell me
if she knew.

812
00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:35,395
Cousin Loxi, you can't.
LOXl: Lend me a shawl, Drusilla.

813
00:56:35,482 --> 00:56:36,892
- Not that one.
- Why?

814
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:38,098
Here.

815
00:56:38,193 --> 00:56:42,854
I thought you didn't like Steve.
LOXl: It's Capt. Phil I'm thinking about.

816
00:56:56,877 --> 00:56:59,831
- Jack.
- There she is, Parson.

817
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:03,507
She is pretty.

818
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:11,722
Full rigged and with a masthead light.
What's your course?

819
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,634
You always turn up when I need you most.

820
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:16,810
I've been on a diving job.
I brought along the parson to finish...

821
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:20,181
I'm sorry, but Jack's gotta go right down
to Capt. Phil's boat.

822
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:24,141
- Steve's in trouble.
- Steve? Steve Tolliver?

823
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:28,696
Now, don't get your mule streak up.
Cutler's selling Steve to a whaler.

824
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:34,067
- What do you care what happens to him?
- You ninny. This is no time to be jealous.

825
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:35,490
But I brought along...

826
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,783
But there's no time for parsons now.
Will you go or not?

827
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:42,996
Sure, I'll go.

828
00:57:43,796 --> 00:57:46,832
No, Jack, I don't trust you.
I'm going with you.

829
00:57:46,924 --> 00:57:50,458
I don't care what he did. He doesn't
deserve what Cutler will do to him.

830
00:57:50,552 --> 00:57:52,877
Sorry, Parson.
I want a church wedding, anyway.

831
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:01,015
Someone's moving out to it now.

832
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:10,067
Feller come now.
Muffle the rest of them tholes.

833
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,533
Yes, sir, this here old soup ladle here
belongs to me.

834
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,194
I hired it out to a feller to fish for sponges.

835
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,410
What in tarnation
can a man do with a sponge?

836
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,912
- You can't eat it.
- No, they haven't much flavour.

837
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:32,708
- What happened to the man?
- Went broke, of course.

838
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,256
- What's that?
- Maybe sea gulls.

839
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:39,050
If they're sea gulls, they're wearing boots.

840
00:58:39,139 --> 00:58:42,140
Take that side.
Chinkapin, cover the light.

841
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,184
Here, take this.

842
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,843
LOXl: Capt. Phil. Steve.
That's Loxi.

843
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,061
Capt. Phil,
I've been having conniptions about you.

844
00:58:57,156 --> 00:58:59,445
Loxi, you shouldn't have come down here.

845
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:02,238
No? Of course, it's no concern of mine...

846
00:59:02,328 --> 00:59:06,788
but Cutler's got you booked
for a three years' cruise aboard a whaler.

847
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,789
My, this old tub sure needs a brush of paint,
Capt. Phil.

848
00:59:10,877 --> 00:59:12,917
- You mean a shanghai?
- So she says.

849
00:59:13,004 --> 00:59:15,791
Got so a man ain't safe in his own grave.

850
00:59:15,882 --> 00:59:18,289
What sort of a fool are you
bringing her down here?

851
00:59:18,384 --> 00:59:19,415
I'm under my own orders.

852
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:23,259
Nobody but an iron-headed sap would
make her witness to a shanghai attempt.

853
00:59:23,347 --> 00:59:25,968
I'll have just about time
to jam that down your throat.

854
00:59:26,058 --> 00:59:29,557
- There's no time for fighting now.
- Look at that dog.

855
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,648
I don't want no killing.
Can't get a dime for no dead men.

856
00:59:38,737 --> 00:59:40,646
Get Loxi out through the galley skylight.

857
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:42,363
LOXl: I can fight.
Don't argue!

858
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:44,108
I'm getting out of here!

859
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,742
Got a gun?
No.

860
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:50,991
Get in there.

861
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,545
You come gentle,
or we got to bust your bones.

862
01:00:07,263 --> 01:00:11,427
Widgeon. Why,
you double-crossing carrion shark.

863
01:00:11,768 --> 01:00:15,765
<i>- That's your mate of the Jubilee?
- Yes. And working with Cutler.</i>

864
01:00:15,938 --> 01:00:17,017
You!

865
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:21,192
Don't let him get away!
Let go of me!

866
01:00:21,944 --> 01:00:25,277
- Get down after them!
- Put up your hooks there, my friends.

867
01:00:27,032 --> 01:00:29,653
You boys just cool your heels there
for a minute.

868
01:00:29,743 --> 01:00:32,115
<i>Ain't nothing down beiow. Few sponges.</i>

869
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:37,661
You don't want that knife!

870
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:40,329
Get off of me!

871
01:00:40,586 --> 01:00:44,453
Don't go away. Don't back up.

872
01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:46,792
You stinking swab!

873
01:00:47,426 --> 01:00:48,837
Let's keep it short.

874
01:00:48,927 --> 01:00:50,587
Devil fire!

875
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:52,630
You crawling crab!

876
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:01,552
Thanks.
I'm saving you for myself.

877
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:05,188
Let me go!
Get him!

878
01:01:07,236 --> 01:01:09,608
Watch that fellow with the club.

879
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,416
- Why don't you shoot?
- I can't. I'm scared of hitting one of our men.

880
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:41,633
- Quit shoving.
- Quit missing.

881
01:01:51,903 --> 01:01:54,738
Don't get up
or I'll empty this pepperbox in you.

882
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,865
Blistering blazes.

883
01:02:01,954 --> 01:02:05,074
- Capt. Phil, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

884
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:09,411
Only I want my legs two inches longer.
LOXl: No, you don't.

885
01:02:10,128 --> 01:02:11,920
Drop that, and get your hands up.

886
01:02:12,005 --> 01:02:16,299
How can I get my hands up, you walleyed...

887
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:18,923
Come out of there, consarn you!

888
01:02:19,387 --> 01:02:22,257
Get your hands up!
Over against the mast.

889
01:02:22,348 --> 01:02:25,883
Come on, you crabs!
Make them fast.

890
01:02:30,773 --> 01:02:34,224
You're going, too, bright eyes.
You've seen too much.

891
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:37,105
I hope this cures you of traipsing around.

892
01:02:39,698 --> 01:02:43,280
You've been pulling strings all your life,
Mr. Lawyer.

893
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:45,526
Why don't you pull one now?

894
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:50,660
I might net myself a lot of trouble.
Shut your clam traps.

895
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,908
You boys will like whaling...

896
01:02:53,294 --> 01:02:55,121
if you can stand the stink.

897
01:02:55,212 --> 01:02:57,205
Look out!

898
01:03:03,136 --> 01:03:04,880
Hold the net down!

899
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:18,350
Jack, behind you, look!

900
01:03:22,154 --> 01:03:23,613
Steve, look!

901
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:28,068
Steve, do something!

902
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:50,175
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

903
01:03:50,597 --> 01:03:53,634
Roll out of there now.
Keep your noses to the deck.

904
01:03:53,725 --> 01:03:56,643
Pass a line around this octopus, will you?

905
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:04,600
You don't like Lamb, do you?

906
01:04:05,737 --> 01:04:07,195
Neither do I.

907
01:04:11,951 --> 01:04:13,742
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

908
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:16,736
You make a lovely good Samaritan.

909
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:19,368
Didn't you scare yourself fighting like that?

910
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:22,209
Your sailor boy brought you
to a right lively party.

911
01:04:22,294 --> 01:04:24,002
- Yeah? Well...
- Now.

912
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:27,372
Wildcats could sure take fighting lessons
from you, Jack.

913
01:04:27,507 --> 01:04:29,914
- Sorry Widgeon got away.
- So am I.

914
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:32,002
Widgeon being here with Cutler's men...

915
01:04:32,095 --> 01:04:36,174
<i>should prove to your Charleston stiff necks
that Jack didn't wreck the Jubilee.</i>

916
01:04:36,265 --> 01:04:38,673
I'm one stiff neck it satisfies.

917
01:04:41,353 --> 01:04:43,642
Ahoy, Widgeon!

918
01:04:51,112 --> 01:04:52,571
Who's there?

919
01:04:53,073 --> 01:04:57,699
<i>Whaler Tyfib
coming for the men you promised.</i>

920
01:04:57,869 --> 01:05:00,157
- You can take your...
- Shut up.

921
01:05:01,122 --> 01:05:02,497
All clear!

922
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:05,781
- Why you cuttle-head...
- Leave it to me, will you?

923
01:05:05,876 --> 01:05:08,663
- You and Loxi get below.
- Come on, Jack.

924
01:05:11,965 --> 01:05:13,543
Come alongside.

925
01:05:16,094 --> 01:05:17,469
Hoist oars.

926
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:21,553
Where's Widgeon?
He's drunk.

927
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:23,016
Boat oars.

928
01:05:23,393 --> 01:05:25,302
Cutler promised some able seamen.

929
01:05:25,395 --> 01:05:28,016
We got five.
Five?

930
01:05:28,689 --> 01:05:32,556
- Great day in the morning! Where are they?
- Right there.

931
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:37,525
Fellow will be glad to know
them sponges finally come in handy.

932
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,487
They'll probably have quite a flavour
before you boys get where you're going.

933
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:44,777
Pretty, ain't they? Go get them.

934
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,113
Wait a minute. How much?

935
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,281
How much? Cutler said $12 a head.

936
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:53,705
- $15.
- Hold on. He said $12.

937
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:56,506
Take them or leave them.

938
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:59,924
At such prices,
they're scarcely worth the picking.

939
01:06:01,095 --> 01:06:05,472
You're a pirate and a thief, but it's a deal.
Bear a hand there.

940
01:06:19,028 --> 01:06:22,397
You've got to give the devil his due.
He's clever.

941
01:06:22,907 --> 01:06:25,065
Clever enough to want you.

942
01:06:29,037 --> 01:06:31,160
- It's only $55.
- I know it.

943
01:06:36,169 --> 01:06:38,541
Heave them over. Head and scale.

944
01:06:41,382 --> 01:06:43,291
Don't break them oars!

945
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:48,252
This walrus weighs as much as a tonne.

946
01:06:48,347 --> 01:06:52,594
I sworn to man, his feet's the biggest things
I ever seen without lungs.

947
01:06:52,685 --> 01:06:55,092
Glad I ain't paying for that one
by the pound.

948
01:06:55,187 --> 01:06:57,808
If he gets rough, tap him with this.

949
01:07:01,026 --> 01:07:04,311
He's singing to you, Lumpy.
Singing like a seal.

950
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:06,565
<i>Heave him over.</i>

951
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:12,910
- Jack, that paper has your name on it.
- What?

952
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:15,071
- What is it?
- I don't know.

953
01:07:15,706 --> 01:07:17,782
Maybe it's a love letter.

954
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,788
You're talking through your crow's nest.

955
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:23,660
He's chewing on that sponge
something awful.

956
01:07:23,755 --> 01:07:26,377
He'll be chewing
salt pork tomorrow.

957
01:07:27,008 --> 01:07:28,586
<i>Heave him over.</i>

958
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:42,060
<i>Jack, it's your appointment.
The Southern Cross.</i>

959
01:07:43,232 --> 01:07:47,181
- Jack, you're captain.
- That's what it is, all right, but...

960
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:52,564
Stow him in the bow, Lumpy.

961
01:07:52,657 --> 01:07:53,986
No, wait!

962
01:07:55,869 --> 01:08:00,162
- Here's $10 for yourself to remember us by.
- You ain't no pinch gut.

963
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:03,157
Shove off. Lay into it.

964
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:09,499
Don't unloosen them till you're out to sea.
They're a little mite tough.

965
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,341
They'll be tender
'fore they get back.

966
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,803
There, but for the grace of Loxi, go I.

967
01:08:19,683 --> 01:08:21,971
She's a great girl, Philpott.

968
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:28,354
Steve Tolliver, I think you're the most
contemptible man I ever met.

969
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:30,766
What's the matter?
Did I sell them too cheap?

970
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:34,394
<i>Who's gonna command the Southern Cross,
Mr. Tolliver?</i>

971
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:43,360
Oh.

972
01:08:43,622 --> 01:08:47,750
- How long have you been carrying this?
- Since I left Charleston.

973
01:08:48,126 --> 01:08:51,625
- Well! When were you gonna give it to him?
- When I got ready.

974
01:08:51,713 --> 01:08:54,666
Commodore Devereaux gave you
that appointment to give to Jack.

975
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:57,295
- Why didn't you give it to him?
- I had my reasons.

976
01:08:57,385 --> 01:09:00,220
And I know what they were, too.
You'd stoop to anything.

977
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:02,795
- Yes?
- Yes.

978
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:06,976
Land of love!

979
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,731
Come on, Loxi.

980
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:16,691
I'll row you home before I call on Mr. Cutler.

981
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,738
Yes, sir, these sponges is wonderful.

982
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:25,610
Pleasant dreams, my friend.
You've had a busy day.

983
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,995
I'll just take these. They might blow away.

984
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:31,780
Oh, Loxi.

985
01:09:35,879 --> 01:09:39,497
I don't know what happened.
I had to swim most a mile.

986
01:09:39,924 --> 01:09:42,711
You cuttle-headed fool.
Why didn't you drown?

987
01:09:42,802 --> 01:09:45,375
Them two swabs is horn-fisted, Mr. Cutler.

988
01:09:45,471 --> 01:09:47,760
- Jack Stuart just hove in.
- Stuart?

989
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:49,758
Out of sight, Widgeon.

990
01:09:59,067 --> 01:10:00,265
Where's Widgeon?

991
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,310
<i>Who? That gooseneck
who was your mate on the Jubilee.</i>

992
01:10:05,448 --> 01:10:07,820
That water didn't rain in here.

993
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:11,866
State your business, Capt. Stuart.

994
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:14,030
I was aboard that sponge boat tonight...

995
01:10:14,123 --> 01:10:16,696
when Widgeon brought your men
on that crimping job.

996
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,037
My men?

997
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:21,875
<i>That's all the proof the government
needs on who sunk the Jubilee.</i>

998
01:10:22,047 --> 01:10:23,210
Well?

999
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:26,634
No more 50°% salvage, Mr. Cutler...

1000
01:10:27,511 --> 01:10:30,844
but a room in a penitentiary
where you and your hatchet men...

1001
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:33,600
can be cosy as fiddler crabs
on a marsh bank.

1002
01:10:37,562 --> 01:10:41,262
You haven't got enough sand in your craw
to stand in front of me alone.

1003
01:10:41,357 --> 01:10:42,934
Clear the room.

1004
01:10:43,025 --> 01:10:45,397
You ain't gonna fight him alone,
are you, King?

1005
01:10:45,486 --> 01:10:47,194
I said, get out.

1006
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:55,159
They'll find you
on a marsh bank someday.

1007
01:11:03,544 --> 01:11:05,620
I didn't think you had it in you.

1008
01:11:05,713 --> 01:11:10,291
I've been looking a long time for a man
who's exactly your size of fool.

1009
01:11:14,763 --> 01:11:17,005
You'll need some more fools.

1010
01:11:17,224 --> 01:11:22,135
Five of your bullyboys have shipped aboard
a whaler for three years in Tolliver's place.

1011
01:11:23,855 --> 01:11:25,349
He sold them?

1012
01:11:27,275 --> 01:11:31,142
Well, what do you know.
He's got brains, that fellow.

1013
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,650
Some of them are loose in his head
right now.

1014
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:38,314
What's the matter?
Don't you like your new boss?

1015
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:41,826
Boss?
Tolliver won't boss the Devereaux line.

1016
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:45,658
<i>I've got command of the Southern Cross
right here in my pocket.</i>

1017
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:49,166
Yes? I've got something here
that says different.

1018
01:11:49,504 --> 01:11:52,125
A sloop's just put in
with dispatches from Charleston.

1019
01:11:52,215 --> 01:11:55,797
- I pulled this one off the bulletin board.
- I'm not here to chew blubber.

1020
01:11:55,885 --> 01:12:00,428
So long as Commodore Devereaux's
house flag is on the sea, I'll answer to him.

1021
01:12:00,848 --> 01:12:03,255
Then you'll answer to the grave.

1022
01:12:04,935 --> 01:12:07,177
Commodore Devereaux is dead.

1023
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:10,181
Pour yourself a drink.

1024
01:12:10,357 --> 01:12:12,812
- You're lying.
- Read it yourself.

1025
01:12:14,694 --> 01:12:17,446
Steve Tolliver's the new head
of Devereaux and Company.

1026
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:21,029
Tolliver's the man you're sailing for,
if you ever sail again.

1027
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:22,659
But you won't.

1028
01:12:23,536 --> 01:12:26,109
You stood on your last quarterdeck.

1029
01:12:27,123 --> 01:12:29,530
But you know that better than I.

1030
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:32,828
Tolliver won't let even a lobster crate
take you aboard.

1031
01:12:33,003 --> 01:12:35,161
I tried to get rid of him for you.

1032
01:12:35,255 --> 01:12:38,505
I'd have had him three years on a hell ship,
lost and forgotten.

1033
01:12:38,592 --> 01:12:41,842
But you made a fine picture
of yourself tonight.

1034
01:12:42,137 --> 01:12:44,462
Fought like 10 men, didn't you?

1035
01:12:44,556 --> 01:12:47,841
Smashed up the toughest men I could send,
didn't you?

1036
01:12:47,934 --> 01:12:52,062
Saved your fancy friend
so he could be your boss. And what for?

1037
01:12:52,813 --> 01:12:56,763
So you could pound your brains out
on a rum keg on the beach.

1038
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:01,194
What did you come here for?
To smash up the only friend you've got.

1039
01:13:02,114 --> 01:13:04,486
And that Claiborne girl.

1040
01:13:05,242 --> 01:13:07,567
She'll stick with you on the beach.

1041
01:13:07,661 --> 01:13:10,234
You'll sleep on the beach
and scratch for food...

1042
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:14,279
but she'll sew your filthy rags together,
if you ask her to.

1043
01:13:15,418 --> 01:13:17,576
Only, you won't ask her to.

1044
01:13:18,045 --> 01:13:21,295
You're slow in the head,
but you're more of a man than that.

1045
01:13:21,382 --> 01:13:24,217
Steve Tolliver will marry her after a while.

1046
01:13:24,301 --> 01:13:28,001
She'll be raising his kids while you're...
Shut up about her!

1047
01:13:28,096 --> 01:13:30,883
Or I'll tear that jaw out of your face.

1048
01:13:32,559 --> 01:13:34,884
You don't have to lie down, you know.

1049
01:13:35,061 --> 01:13:38,347
They need 10,000 blacks
in the Mississippi basin.

1050
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:40,930
<i>Biack men bring a dollar a pound.</i>

1051
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:46,697
I'll put you back
on the quarterdeck of a ship.

1052
01:13:46,781 --> 01:13:49,865
You take her to the Gold Coast,
load her with black ivory.

1053
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:53,650
In two years, you'll own your own ship.
In 10, you'll own a fleet.

1054
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:55,619
Your own house flag on seven seas.

1055
01:13:55,706 --> 01:13:58,161
- Too slow.
- Slow, with the job I'm offering you?

1056
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,535
The devil with that job.
I've got a job for you.

1057
01:14:02,712 --> 01:14:05,464
<i>Do you know what cargo
the Southern Cross carries?</i>

1058
01:14:05,548 --> 01:14:09,296
Teak, ivory, spices, silks, indigo.

1059
01:14:10,469 --> 01:14:13,803
- Why?
- I'll show you how to get rich in one night.

1060
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:17,967
Get your wreckers out
to meet me at Satan Shoal.

1061
01:14:19,144 --> 01:14:21,979
<i>I'm gonna pile up the Southern Cross.</i>

1062
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:26,025
Now you've caught the wind. $500,000.

1063
01:14:26,109 --> 01:14:27,224
But listen to me.

1064
01:14:27,318 --> 01:14:30,983
<i>Tolliver won't leave you in command
of the Southern Cross for 10 minutes...</i>

1065
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:32,696
when he hears of this.

1066
01:14:32,782 --> 01:14:35,237
My schooner will take you
to Havana tonight.

1067
01:14:35,326 --> 01:14:37,484
And I've got just the mate you need.

1068
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:39,617
<i>Widgeon, come out here.</i>

1069
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:45,077
Yes, Mr. Cutler.

1070
01:14:52,092 --> 01:14:53,965
Hiya, Capt. Stuart.

1071
01:15:09,566 --> 01:15:12,650
But I'll be back.
I'll be back on the very first ship.

1072
01:15:12,736 --> 01:15:16,354
- I'll go with you and make sure.
- No, Dan, you mustn't.

1073
01:15:17,407 --> 01:15:20,194
I can manage Mother much better alone.

1074
01:15:20,368 --> 01:15:23,571
If they try to keep you in Havana,
I'll bust that town...

1075
01:15:26,749 --> 01:15:30,200
I'm coming back to you, Dan.
Cross my heart, I will.

1076
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:33,830
I don't care what Loxi says,
and I don't care what anybody thinks.

1077
01:15:33,922 --> 01:15:37,042
I'm coming back. On the very first ship.

1078
01:15:43,515 --> 01:15:48,591
Two hundred ceroons of Bengal indigo
at $1.25, down 10.

1079
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:52,395
Twelve-hundred-and-fifty pieces
Nanking silk...

1080
01:15:52,482 --> 01:15:55,186
at $3.98 the pound...

1081
01:15:55,276 --> 01:15:57,268
Look at that board now.

1082
01:15:57,903 --> 01:16:00,311
Raw silk has gone to blue blazes.

1083
01:16:00,406 --> 01:16:04,652
...at $4.40, down seven.
- And there goes ivory, down another seven.

1084
01:16:05,077 --> 01:16:07,650
Looks like the first call for panic.

1085
01:16:09,789 --> 01:16:13,407
Teak, silk, ivory, indigo.

1086
01:16:14,419 --> 01:16:18,665
A wreck always sends prices down
of whatever cargo she's carrying.

1087
01:16:19,006 --> 01:16:21,580
Right. Except there's been no wreck.

1088
01:16:22,718 --> 01:16:25,423
<i>That's the cargo of the Southern Cross.</i>

1089
01:16:25,512 --> 01:16:29,973
<i>Southern Cross can't have wrecked.
She's safe in Havana.</i>

1090
01:16:30,309 --> 01:16:32,799
Then somebody knows she will wreck.

1091
01:16:32,894 --> 01:16:35,350
- And she sails before dawn.
- Yes.

1092
01:16:35,855 --> 01:16:37,978
Capt. Stuart in command.

1093
01:16:39,109 --> 01:16:42,442
<i>- What's the fastest vessel in port?
- Claiborne.</i>

1094
01:16:42,737 --> 01:16:45,903
- Then get your crew aboard.
- You're forgetting who owns her.

1095
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:48,279
- Loxi won't charter to you.
- Then commandeer.

1096
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:51,036
<i>I've got to stop the Southern Cross
in Havana.</i>

1097
01:17:05,592 --> 01:17:10,337
Come morning, we'll have such a fog
as a man can't cut with a crosscut saw.

1098
01:17:13,849 --> 01:17:16,554
We'll need a new door on the lazaret.

1099
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:21,346
- How far have we come?
- We left Sand Key about 4 miles astern.

1100
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,479
We come about 15 miles.

1101
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:26,068
Let her out.

1102
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:29,152
Let her out, he says.

1103
01:17:30,615 --> 01:17:32,406
Let her out, Jake!

1104
01:17:33,201 --> 01:17:35,110
And run for your life!

1105
01:17:36,704 --> 01:17:38,412
LOXl: Get out of my way!

1106
01:17:39,665 --> 01:17:42,370
- How dare you let him steal my schooner!
- Now, Loxi...

1107
01:17:42,459 --> 01:17:45,496
Stand by to come about! Hard alee!
Bring her up.

1108
01:17:45,587 --> 01:17:48,505
- Hard alee it is.
- Get forward. I'll take over.

1109
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:49,919
Aye, sir.

1110
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:53,509
This is piracy, kidnapping.
Stand away from that wheel.

1111
01:17:53,595 --> 01:17:56,465
Loxi, when we found you aboard,
I begged you to go ashore.

1112
01:17:56,556 --> 01:17:59,723
I wouldn't go ashore
because I knew what he was about.

1113
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:02,561
You've done everything you could
to down Jack Stuart.

1114
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:06,974
- I'm acting under federal authority.
- Racing to Havana to break him?

1115
01:18:08,609 --> 01:18:11,645
You believe in Jack
above all things on Earth, don't you?

1116
01:18:11,737 --> 01:18:14,856
- I'll always believe in him.
- Come here, Loxi.

1117
01:18:16,033 --> 01:18:20,030
- I'll never forgive you for helping.
- Honey, you got to know the truth.

1118
01:18:20,161 --> 01:18:24,408
<i>Jack made a deal with Cutler.
He's gonna wreck the Southern Cross.</i>

1119
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,787
- Capt. Phil, have you been drinking?
- We'll put that to one side.

1120
01:18:32,882 --> 01:18:35,289
I'd rather be drowned dead than hurt you.

1121
01:18:35,384 --> 01:18:38,053
- Did Jack tell you that himself?
- No, he didn't.

1122
01:18:38,137 --> 01:18:40,841
I wouldn't believe it even if he had.

1123
01:18:43,934 --> 01:18:46,341
- Steve, won't you put back?
- No.

1124
01:18:47,645 --> 01:18:51,643
I'm sorry I'm the one to do this to you,
but it doesn't matter what you believe.

1125
01:18:51,733 --> 01:18:54,733
<i>Jack Stuart will not sail in command
of the Southern Cross.</i>

1126
01:18:54,819 --> 01:18:58,484
But that's ruin. Don't smash his life
just because your pride is hurt.

1127
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:00,150
How will he get another command?

1128
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:05,151
He'll never command even a mud scow in
this world or the next, once I reach Havana.

1129
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,452
Then you'll never reach Havana.

1130
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:16,001
LOXl: Come about or I'll part the halyards.

1131
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:17,666
No, Loxi, you'll wreck her!

1132
01:19:17,757 --> 01:19:19,168
You crazy little wildcat!

1133
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:21,749
LOXl: Will you put back?
Not while she floats.

1134
01:19:25,931 --> 01:19:27,473
The gaff jaws are smashed.

1135
01:19:27,558 --> 01:19:28,756
Get a lashing on this sail!

1136
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:32,350
<i>I reckon you won't stop the Southern Cross
from my ship, Mr. Tolliver.</i>

1137
01:19:32,437 --> 01:19:34,430
Get a line on this gaff.

1138
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,734
No, Loxi, you'll jibe her!
Don't part that line.

1139
01:19:58,879 --> 01:19:59,993
What's the damage?

1140
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:03,753
We'll drift for six or seven hours
while we jury-rig and re-bend.

1141
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:05,336
Six or seven hours?

1142
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:07,503
Down with your jibs and staysail.

1143
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:09,464
<i>If the Southern Cross goes down...</i>

1144
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:14,431
<i>The Southern Cross isn't going down,
Capt. Stuart's in command.</i>

1145
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,807
Sam, lay on those downhauls.

1146
01:20:41,168 --> 01:20:44,335
Case 52, Nanking silk.

1147
01:20:44,755 --> 01:20:46,795
Claim that starboard side.

1148
01:20:47,549 --> 01:20:50,883
Widgeon, stow the rest of that oil
in the orlop.

1149
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:52,381
Aye, sir.

1150
01:20:53,096 --> 01:20:56,014
I told you, Drusilla, we carry no passengers.

1151
01:20:56,099 --> 01:20:59,053
Please, Jack, you've just got to take me.

1152
01:20:59,686 --> 01:21:02,011
It's like life and death to me.

1153
01:21:02,105 --> 01:21:05,224
I can't take you. Believe me.

1154
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:08,894
Now, you go on back to your mother
and stop begging.

1155
01:21:08,986 --> 01:21:11,607
When you get that stuff stowed,
batten down.

1156
01:21:12,489 --> 01:21:14,980
Jack, listen to me, please.

1157
01:21:16,451 --> 01:21:19,820
Jack, you ought to understand
and help me...

1158
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:23,157
because you love Loxi...

1159
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:27,247
and she wants to be with you,
just like I want to be with Dan.

1160
01:21:29,213 --> 01:21:31,005
Please, Jack, I...

1161
01:21:33,175 --> 01:21:36,010
I'm running away from home to marry him.

1162
01:21:36,095 --> 01:21:39,261
Will you go ashore or do I put you off?

1163
01:21:43,352 --> 01:21:45,807
All ashore. Get going.
Batten down here.

1164
01:21:45,896 --> 01:21:47,176
Aye, sir.

1165
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:53,482
She's all singled up, sir.

1166
01:21:54,362 --> 01:21:57,067
Stand by, forward.
Aye, aye, sir.

1167
01:21:57,156 --> 01:21:58,271
Planks off.

1168
01:21:59,367 --> 01:22:00,944
<i>Heim amidships.</i>

1169
01:22:02,995 --> 01:22:06,328
Hold fast, aft! Let go of your forward line!

1170
01:22:06,957 --> 01:22:08,416
<i>Slow astern.</i>

1171
01:22:41,698 --> 01:22:45,647
- No bottom, sir.
- We missed it by a split hair.

1172
01:22:45,952 --> 01:22:49,996
I wasn't gonna say nothing, but we might
nigh have drifted on Satan Shoal.

1173
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:52,654
That's the worst pack of reefs
around here anywhere.

1174
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,582
- Should have anchored hours ago.
- Yes, in 400 fathom.

1175
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:04,168
That horn's driving me crazy.
Nearer all the time, but never gets here!

1176
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,554
LOXl: Hour after hour!
One hour.

1177
01:23:11,309 --> 01:23:13,681
I never heard a horn like that.

1178
01:23:14,228 --> 01:23:17,680
Sounds like something
out of the bottom of the sea.

1179
01:23:17,815 --> 01:23:20,732
Probably a hand-pumped horn
worked by a crank.

1180
01:23:20,818 --> 01:23:23,772
Yes. Pumping his own wind, too, likely.

1181
01:23:23,862 --> 01:23:27,990
<i>I know it's steam!
Well, suppose it is the Southern Cross.</i>

1182
01:23:28,617 --> 01:23:31,950
Jack knows what he's doing.
He can pick a channel.

1183
01:23:33,538 --> 01:23:37,488
<i>LOXl: But it isn't. It's the Saturn,
or some other paddle coaster.</i>

1184
01:23:42,505 --> 01:23:45,624
I suppose you know whose conch that is?

1185
01:23:47,092 --> 01:23:49,132
<i>That's Cutler's Falcon.</i>

1186
01:23:49,219 --> 01:23:53,680
Yes. You don't need to smell the bait
to know somebody's going fishing.

1187
01:23:53,765 --> 01:23:55,639
The steamer's safe. She's got power!

1188
01:23:55,726 --> 01:24:00,767
Wind or no wind, she's not drifting around
helpless like a cracker box, like us.

1189
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:03,105
No bottom, sir.

1190
01:24:06,778 --> 01:24:08,355
Go on, say it.

1191
01:24:09,822 --> 01:24:12,739
We'd be in Havana except for what I did.

1192
01:24:12,908 --> 01:24:15,695
I'm glad I did it and I'd do it again!

1193
01:24:17,371 --> 01:24:20,989
- Because with all my heart I believe in him.
- Yeah.

1194
01:24:24,961 --> 01:24:26,336
Hark, ye.

1195
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:32,050
Hark, ye!

1196
01:24:34,762 --> 01:24:37,467
- Can you see her?
- You'll be seeing her soon enough.

1197
01:24:37,556 --> 01:24:39,679
Sound your sea horn, Sam!

1198
01:24:58,076 --> 01:24:59,700
Any minute now.

1199
01:25:02,288 --> 01:25:04,197
More steam.
Aye, sir.

1200
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:07,285
Drive her.

1201
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:13,539
<i>That'll be the Falcon's signal.</i>

1202
01:25:13,632 --> 01:25:16,383
- Sounded to me like...
- Heave the lead!

1203
01:25:17,093 --> 01:25:18,801
Heave it is, sir.

1204
01:25:54,337 --> 01:25:58,204
More steam you want?
She's shaking her caulks out now.

1205
01:25:59,174 --> 01:26:01,381
- You, Salt Meat.
- Yeah?

1206
01:26:01,468 --> 01:26:04,339
Check the forward well,
she must be making water.

1207
01:26:04,846 --> 01:26:06,886
Jughead, get over there!

1208
01:27:22,502 --> 01:27:25,954
There she rises. Laying straight for the reef.

1209
01:27:33,263 --> 01:27:35,089
<i>The Southern Cross.</i>

1210
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:51,904
LOXl: No. It can't be.

1211
01:27:53,365 --> 01:27:54,775
Oh, Steve.

1212
01:28:01,789 --> 01:28:03,829
Give me that horn, Sam.

1213
01:28:17,721 --> 01:28:19,548
It's going astride.

1214
01:28:20,015 --> 01:28:23,929
Jack! Hard astern, Jack!

1215
01:28:24,894 --> 01:28:29,057
The reef! You're going to strike!

1216
01:28:56,215 --> 01:29:00,628
Pretty work. She's plastered on the reef
like a herring on a biscuit.

1217
01:29:02,221 --> 01:29:04,759
Man the lifeboats!
Aye, aye, sir.

1218
01:29:05,599 --> 01:29:07,591
She's down by the head.

1219
01:29:11,354 --> 01:29:13,513
- She's a killed ship.
- Yeah.

1220
01:29:14,065 --> 01:29:17,185
There ain't nothing left
but to get her people off.

1221
01:29:17,277 --> 01:29:19,269
There's one thing left.

1222
01:29:20,363 --> 01:29:23,198
Arrest the man
who murdered his own command.

1223
01:29:23,282 --> 01:29:26,781
Stand by your boat tackle!
Aye, aye, Capt. Phil.

1224
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:29,072
Look after her.

1225
01:29:30,414 --> 01:29:32,620
Lower away!
Aye, aye, sir.

1226
01:29:38,964 --> 01:29:42,000
Capt. Phil,
why didn't he kill me instead?

1227
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:53,969
<i>And the night before you took command
of the Southern Cross...</i>

1228
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:57,097
did you or did you not talk to King Cutler...

1229
01:29:57,981 --> 01:30:00,472
this same man who is now
conducting your defence?

1230
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:01,942
Objection, Your Honour.

1231
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:04,648
Mr. Cutler is defending Capt. Stuart,
not himself.

1232
01:30:04,738 --> 01:30:07,145
Your Honour, before this case is finished...

1233
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:10,157
I propose to throw
the shadow of the gallows...

1234
01:30:10,243 --> 01:30:12,235
over many in this room.

1235
01:30:16,665 --> 01:30:18,658
The witness may answer.

1236
01:30:19,543 --> 01:30:22,627
Sure, I talked to King Cutler. So have you.

1237
01:30:24,715 --> 01:30:29,376
Capt. Stuart, there are other able skippers
with ships in Rotten Row...

1238
01:30:30,095 --> 01:30:34,803
but you were the first to stand in defence
of the pirate wreckers that haunt these Keys.

1239
01:30:34,891 --> 01:30:37,595
<i>I don't ask what
unendurabie circumstance drove you...</i>

1240
01:30:37,685 --> 01:30:40,556
to join these men whom you must despise.

1241
01:30:40,938 --> 01:30:44,556
<i>But i will ask the court
for lenlency in your behalf...</i>

1242
01:30:44,942 --> 01:30:48,227
if you will join with me
in the destruction of these rats.

1243
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,605
<i>Tell us who was behind
the wrecking of the Southern Cross.</i>

1244
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:54,657
I'm not hiding behind anybody, Tolliver.

1245
01:30:55,035 --> 01:30:58,368
If you're trying to hang Cutler,
hang him for some other wreck.

1246
01:30:58,455 --> 01:31:01,954
<i>Nobody gave any orders
on the Southern Cross but me.</i>

1247
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:06,000
You admit giving the order
that drove that ship at top speed...

1248
01:31:06,087 --> 01:31:08,874
through thick fog to sure destruction?

1249
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:10,756
I was her skipper.

1250
01:31:12,426 --> 01:31:14,715
And who was your first mate?

1251
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:18,258
Matthias Widgeon.

1252
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:21,053
<i>The same man who was first mate
of the wrecked Jubiiee?</i>

1253
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:22,257
Yes.

1254
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,685
Your witness, Mr. Cutler.

1255
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,193
No questions.

1256
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,029
That's all.

1257
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:38,982
Call Capt. Phillip Philpott.

1258
01:31:39,451 --> 01:31:41,491
Capt. Philpott, please.

1259
01:31:45,207 --> 01:31:48,492
Adinarin, how did you
finally get home last night?

1260
01:31:51,629 --> 01:31:55,247
You go back to the house
and look after Mother. Tell her I'm all right.

1261
01:31:55,341 --> 01:31:57,914
Just when they're a-getting heated up.

1262
01:31:59,053 --> 01:32:02,801
<i>You were an eyewitness
to the wreck of the Southern Cross?</i>

1263
01:32:04,099 --> 01:32:05,759
How would you judge her speed?

1264
01:32:05,851 --> 01:32:10,809
Why, she come thrashing through
the fog there, fit to bust her ballast.

1265
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:16,981
<i>- How long have you known Capt. Stuart?
- Ever since Cutler wrecked the Jubilee.</i>

1266
01:32:17,195 --> 01:32:19,768
I object to this scandalous attack!

1267
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:23,406
Strike out the answer.

1268
01:32:24,202 --> 01:32:27,820
In your opinion, could that wreck
have been anything but deliberate?

1269
01:32:27,913 --> 01:32:29,870
Object!
Sustain.

1270
01:32:29,957 --> 01:32:33,491
- It was a typical King Cutler job.
- I said sustain!

1271
01:32:33,585 --> 01:32:35,910
I heard you, Will. Jehoshaphat.

1272
01:32:36,129 --> 01:32:38,537
<i>I'm only answering the man's questions.</i>

1273
01:32:39,591 --> 01:32:42,082
Silence!
Your witness.

1274
01:32:45,096 --> 01:32:47,254
No questions.
No questions?

1275
01:32:47,348 --> 01:32:49,637
Man gets up here for nothing.

1276
01:32:51,519 --> 01:32:54,188
I ask you to remember
that a man is on trial here...

1277
01:32:54,271 --> 01:32:57,189
for the gravest offence known to the sea.

1278
01:32:57,274 --> 01:32:59,730
<i>Except that no loss of life is shown...</i>

1279
01:32:59,818 --> 01:33:03,436
<i>this man, if guilty, might well hang.
Proceed.</i>

1280
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:06,948
I thank Your Honour.
We admit the defendant's error...

1281
01:33:07,033 --> 01:33:09,785
but you cannot convict a captain
for bad seamanship.

1282
01:33:09,869 --> 01:33:10,984
Your Honour...

1283
01:33:11,079 --> 01:33:14,779
we will show that behind the
bad seamanship lay a criminal conspiracy.

1284
01:33:14,874 --> 01:33:17,958
And will you also show
why you were waiting beside the reef...

1285
01:33:18,044 --> 01:33:20,581
<i>when the Southern Cross went down?</i>

1286
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:25,373
Your Honour, if this man
is to go on as prosecutor...

1287
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:30,425
the strange part which he himself has
played in this disaster cannot be ignored.

1288
01:33:30,514 --> 01:33:34,807
<i>Why were you waiting beside the reef
that sank the Southern Cross?</i>

1289
01:33:35,477 --> 01:33:38,561
It's in the testimony
that Mr. Tolliver's vessel fell becalmed.

1290
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:41,398
Becalmed when the wind held till dawn?

1291
01:33:41,607 --> 01:33:46,234
He tells us he sailed all night,
yet he was only 15 miles on his course.

1292
01:33:47,071 --> 01:33:49,906
Why? He dares not answer.

1293
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:53,657
Because the only living man
who could have foretold that wreck...

1294
01:33:53,744 --> 01:33:55,867
is the man who planned it!

1295
01:33:56,705 --> 01:33:58,247
Capt. Phil.

1296
01:33:58,748 --> 01:34:00,159
Gentlemen.

1297
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:05,495
There are a thousand ways
by which conniving men may profit...

1298
01:34:05,588 --> 01:34:08,161
by the wrecking of their own ships.

1299
01:34:08,424 --> 01:34:12,422
And there stands
a Charleston sea lawyer who knows them all.

1300
01:34:14,346 --> 01:34:17,632
He swindled his underwriters!
He swindled you...

1301
01:34:18,767 --> 01:34:22,052
as he lay at Satan Shoal
to gut the cargo of a ship...

1302
01:34:22,145 --> 01:34:23,853
he himself had wrecked!

1303
01:34:23,939 --> 01:34:28,316
- That cargo ain't been touched.
- Only because no diver will go down.

1304
01:34:28,985 --> 01:34:31,772
That ship hangs on the reef by a hair.

1305
01:34:32,655 --> 01:34:37,198
Your Honour, I demand an answer.
Why was Stephen Tolliver at that reef?

1306
01:34:37,993 --> 01:34:40,365
Mr. Tolliver, will you answer?

1307
01:34:40,996 --> 01:34:43,783
I will not.
Of course he won't answer.

1308
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:46,000
He can't.

1309
01:34:49,171 --> 01:34:51,459
If you please, Judge Marvin.

1310
01:34:52,007 --> 01:34:55,838
I can tell you why Mr. Tolliver
won't answer that question.

1311
01:34:58,638 --> 01:35:01,211
Miss Claiborne cannot testify
unless she is called.

1312
01:35:01,307 --> 01:35:05,351
Mr. Tolliver, do you wish Miss Claiborne
sworn as your witness?

1313
01:35:07,187 --> 01:35:08,563
I do not.

1314
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:12,726
But he's charging Steve
with something he didn't do.

1315
01:35:12,818 --> 01:35:16,566
Your Honour, there is nothing to be gained
by calling her.

1316
01:35:19,407 --> 01:35:22,741
I call Miss Claiborne
as a witness for the court.

1317
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:31,908
<i>The reason the Claiborne didn't reach
Havana was that I disabled her.</i>

1318
01:35:32,002 --> 01:35:33,200
You disabled her?

1319
01:35:33,295 --> 01:35:36,746
I parted the main beak halyards
with a wrecking axe.

1320
01:35:36,965 --> 01:35:38,128
Why?

1321
01:35:41,803 --> 01:35:44,424
Because I had faith in Jack Stuart.

1322
01:35:47,016 --> 01:35:51,678
<i>Didn't Mr. Tolliver tell you that he believed
Stuart would wreck the Southern Cross?</i>

1323
01:35:51,771 --> 01:35:53,479
Yes, sir, he did.

1324
01:35:53,898 --> 01:35:57,267
Miss Claiborne had every reason
not to believe me.

1325
01:35:57,359 --> 01:35:59,151
This is incredible.

1326
01:36:00,446 --> 01:36:03,150
Have you any questions, Mr. Tolliver?

1327
01:36:04,866 --> 01:36:07,404
None.
I certainly have.

1328
01:36:09,037 --> 01:36:11,872
So, Miss Claiborne,
you disabled this vessel?

1329
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:14,910
Virtually knocked her apart
with your own little hands...

1330
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:19,248
while a full crew of able seamen
stood around sucking their teeth.

1331
01:36:19,338 --> 01:36:20,619
No, gentlemen.

1332
01:36:20,715 --> 01:36:24,712
What you have heard is a girl
caught hopelessly between two men...

1333
01:36:24,802 --> 01:36:27,471
who have fought over her
as dogs fight over a bone.

1334
01:36:27,554 --> 01:36:29,761
I object to this...
Sustained.

1335
01:36:29,848 --> 01:36:32,600
Didn't you play these men
one against the other...

1336
01:36:32,684 --> 01:36:34,807
encouraging each in turn?

1337
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:39,563
Isn't that why they're both
hopelessly entangled in this disaster?

1338
01:36:39,941 --> 01:36:41,732
I won't answer that.

1339
01:36:41,818 --> 01:36:45,352
Isn't that why you're now trying to undo
what you've done...

1340
01:36:45,446 --> 01:36:49,360
by taking some part
of Stephen Tolliver's guilt to yourself?

1341
01:36:49,533 --> 01:36:53,282
Judge Marvin, we're not here to crucify
this woman who's not even on trial.

1342
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:57,320
No, we're here to learn the facts,
and they're deadly plain.

1343
01:36:57,666 --> 01:37:00,999
Now we can understand
this vicious persecution of a man...

1344
01:37:01,086 --> 01:37:05,332
whose only crime is that
he stands between Tolliver and that girl.

1345
01:37:06,049 --> 01:37:08,586
Your Honour, when this case is over...

1346
01:37:08,676 --> 01:37:13,338
the court may bring me to trial
on Mr. Cutler's charges if it so desires.

1347
01:37:15,099 --> 01:37:18,265
But the government's case
against Jack Stuart is not over.

1348
01:37:18,352 --> 01:37:23,476
<i>For years we've tried to find one witness
who wouid turn against this pirate ring.</i>

1349
01:37:24,483 --> 01:37:26,689
That witness has been found.

1350
01:37:27,402 --> 01:37:31,446
I ask the court's leave to call a man
who, to save his own neck from the halter...

1351
01:37:31,531 --> 01:37:33,654
has made full confession.

1352
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:37,153
Matthias Widgeon.

1353
01:37:39,914 --> 01:37:42,535
Granted. Step down, Miss Claiborne.

1354
01:37:50,632 --> 01:37:53,040
- Did Widgeon talk?
- Yes.

1355
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,421
He talked.

1356
01:37:56,596 --> 01:37:59,929
<i>Call Matthias Widgeon,
mate of the Southern Cross.</i>

1357
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:03,054
Call Matthias Widgeon.
Widgeon!

1358
01:38:06,147 --> 01:38:07,522
Come on...

1359
01:38:13,987 --> 01:38:16,525
Sheriff! Widgeon is dead!

1360
01:38:17,532 --> 01:38:19,608
<i>Sheriff, Widgeon is dead!</i>

1361
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:22,236
Doctor, in your opinion...

1362
01:38:22,328 --> 01:38:26,789
- how long has Widgeon been dead?
- Less than half an hour, Your Honour.

1363
01:38:31,379 --> 01:38:33,252
Maybe good riddance.

1364
01:38:35,966 --> 01:38:40,094
Your Honour, this case must be recessed
for full investigation.

1365
01:38:40,304 --> 01:38:44,348
I can hardly recess in lieu of a witness
who can never appear.

1366
01:38:44,516 --> 01:38:48,134
- But if federal council wishes to withdraw...
- Withdraw?

1367
01:38:48,269 --> 01:38:52,053
But, Your Honour,
America's very life depends upon the sea.

1368
01:38:53,733 --> 01:38:56,899
This case goes far beyond
the fate of one man...

1369
01:38:56,986 --> 01:38:59,311
who betrayed his own command.

1370
01:38:59,488 --> 01:39:03,320
We must know whether any group of men
can endanger the safety of our seas...

1371
01:39:03,409 --> 01:39:05,946
by preying upon American commerce.

1372
01:39:07,037 --> 01:39:09,575
<i>The government's witness
has been murdered...</i>

1373
01:39:09,664 --> 01:39:11,740
but we elect to proceed.

1374
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:13,375
Just a minute.

1375
01:39:14,419 --> 01:39:18,167
I agree that he was murdered,
silenced for what he knew.

1376
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:23,715
I charge that Widgeon drove that ship
on the reef in direct conspiracy with you.

1377
01:39:23,803 --> 01:39:27,385
- You're off your course, Cutler.
- I told you he was a bad Yankee.

1378
01:39:27,473 --> 01:39:30,142
You can sustain that, too, Will,
if you've a mind to.

1379
01:39:30,225 --> 01:39:33,179
Certainly this poor, honest seaman
had no knowledge of it.

1380
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:35,512
Why did he order his stokers
driven under the whip?

1381
01:39:35,605 --> 01:39:38,606
- That has not been shown.
- I'll show it now.

1382
01:39:39,401 --> 01:39:41,025
Call Salt Meat.

1383
01:39:46,074 --> 01:39:48,908
Your name is Salt Meat?
Aye, aye, sir.

1384
01:39:50,119 --> 01:39:52,740
And you're a Barbados freeman
who served as stoker...

1385
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:55,831
<i>- aboard the Southern Cross?
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

1386
01:39:57,417 --> 01:40:00,537
You know Capt. Stuart's voice, don't you?

1387
01:40:01,213 --> 01:40:02,921
I reckon I do.

1388
01:40:03,548 --> 01:40:06,039
- Didn't you hear him order full speed?
- Why...

1389
01:40:06,134 --> 01:40:08,091
Objection.
Sustained.

1390
01:40:11,347 --> 01:40:14,597
You were in the stokehold
at the time of the wreck, were you not?

1391
01:40:14,684 --> 01:40:16,925
No, sir. I was in the orlop.

1392
01:40:17,561 --> 01:40:18,640
You were in the orlop?

1393
01:40:18,729 --> 01:40:20,389
Yes, sir. That's where I was...

1394
01:40:20,481 --> 01:40:23,517
when the steamer,
she smashed against that reef...

1395
01:40:23,609 --> 01:40:25,981
and I heard that dying scream.

1396
01:40:28,947 --> 01:40:30,571
You heard what?

1397
01:40:31,282 --> 01:40:34,153
When the reef tore out
the heart of that ship...

1398
01:40:34,244 --> 01:40:36,402
she screamed like a woman.

1399
01:40:37,497 --> 01:40:40,912
You mean you heard tearing timbers,
escaping steam.

1400
01:40:41,917 --> 01:40:44,954
Twenty years I know the sea...

1401
01:40:45,129 --> 01:40:47,335
like I knows day from dark.

1402
01:40:48,132 --> 01:40:52,378
But I never heard no sound like that,
except when a woman die.

1403
01:40:53,762 --> 01:40:56,383
Was there a woman aboard?
No, sir.

1404
01:40:56,806 --> 01:40:59,558
I think she go ashore before we sail.

1405
01:41:00,059 --> 01:41:03,060
- Who?
- The lady what talked to the Captain.

1406
01:41:04,313 --> 01:41:05,594
A lady?

1407
01:41:05,898 --> 01:41:08,270
You know who she was?
No, sir.

1408
01:41:09,652 --> 01:41:11,360
What did she look like?

1409
01:41:11,445 --> 01:41:15,063
I don't rightly recomember
how she was dressed...

1410
01:41:15,157 --> 01:41:18,241
but she was wrapped
in a mighty pretty shawl.

1411
01:41:19,828 --> 01:41:22,533
- What kind of a shawl?
- What colour?

1412
01:41:23,915 --> 01:41:25,742
What kind of a shawl?

1413
01:41:26,084 --> 01:41:29,453
I don't know, but it was mighty pretty.

1414
01:41:30,379 --> 01:41:32,419
Kind of red and yellow.

1415
01:41:35,968 --> 01:41:39,551
Your Honour, I request permission
to interrupt this testimony...

1416
01:41:39,638 --> 01:41:42,841
- and recall Jack Stuart to the stand.
- Granted.

1417
01:41:43,225 --> 01:41:46,594
- That's all, Salt Meat.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1418
01:41:46,770 --> 01:41:49,687
Your Honour, this ghost story
has no bearing on the case.

1419
01:41:49,773 --> 01:41:52,394
No woman was rescued from that ship.

1420
01:41:52,901 --> 01:41:57,147
If one was aboard, murder must be added
to the charge of wrecking.

1421
01:41:58,823 --> 01:42:02,156
<i>- Did the Southern Cross carry passengers?
- No.</i>

1422
01:42:02,326 --> 01:42:04,698
But a woman came aboard
just before you cast off.

1423
01:42:04,787 --> 01:42:07,574
- What of it? She didn't sail.
- You sure of that?

1424
01:42:08,999 --> 01:42:11,668
Who saw her leave? Did you?

1425
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,620
I ordered her ashore.

1426
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:18,626
- She might've stowed away.
- She wouldn't have stowed away.

1427
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,460
Then you knew her!

1428
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:25,343
Yes. I knew her.

1429
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:30,052
Jack. Was it Drusilla?

1430
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,640
Yes. It was Drusilla.

1431
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:38,807
Drusilla Alston?
Yes.

1432
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:43,399
Who screamed?

1433
01:42:44,032 --> 01:42:46,736
- Who screamed?
- Keep your head, Dan.

1434
01:42:47,827 --> 01:42:49,369
Dan, keep out of this!

1435
01:42:49,453 --> 01:42:52,407
If that scream was Drusilla,
I'll tear the throat out of you.

1436
01:42:52,498 --> 01:42:55,452
- She wasn't onboard.
- You're lying. You didn't see her leave.

1437
01:42:55,543 --> 01:42:57,831
Dan, shut up!
Order in this court!

1438
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,295
I call Dan Cutler to the stand.

1439
01:42:59,379 --> 01:43:03,247
I object to the questioning of a man
who's out of his mind with grief and fear.

1440
01:43:03,341 --> 01:43:04,586
Overruled.

1441
01:43:04,676 --> 01:43:06,882
Dan Cutler, take the stand.

1442
01:43:09,848 --> 01:43:13,548
- You loved Drusilla Alston, didn't you?
- Yes.

1443
01:43:14,394 --> 01:43:17,430
- She loved you?
- Yes.

1444
01:43:18,064 --> 01:43:20,601
And you were going to be married?

1445
01:43:21,650 --> 01:43:22,813
Yes.

1446
01:43:23,902 --> 01:43:27,900
She promised to come back to you
soon from Havana. Didn't she?

1447
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,573
- Yes.
- On what ship?

1448
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:35,162
The first one she could get.

1449
01:43:35,246 --> 01:43:38,200
<i>And that happened to be
the Southern Cross.</i>

1450
01:43:39,834 --> 01:43:43,701
I knew Drusilla, Dan.
A sweet and lovely young girl.

1451
01:43:45,297 --> 01:43:48,500
She begged you 100 times
to give up the rotten business...

1452
01:43:48,592 --> 01:43:49,837
you and your brother are in.

1453
01:43:49,927 --> 01:43:51,800
Objection.
Sustained.

1454
01:43:52,179 --> 01:43:55,180
<i>We heard the Falcon's call through the fog.</i>

1455
01:43:55,891 --> 01:43:57,634
Your boat, Dan...

1456
01:43:58,143 --> 01:44:01,428
<i>waiting like a bird of prey
for the Southern Cross...</i>

1457
01:44:01,521 --> 01:44:04,308
which you knew would strike. Didn't you?

1458
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:06,190
Don't answer that.

1459
01:44:06,484 --> 01:44:10,481
But you did not know that your sweetheart
was aboard that doomed ship.

1460
01:44:10,571 --> 01:44:12,611
Did you?
Don't answer.

1461
01:44:14,116 --> 01:44:17,033
The Lord moves in a mysterious way, Dan.

1462
01:44:18,078 --> 01:44:23,036
You didn't hear that scream, but it'll ring
in your brain through all eternity.

1463
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,918
- I don't believe she's down there.
- We don't know, Dan.

1464
01:44:27,003 --> 01:44:29,411
But some woman is down there...

1465
01:44:29,672 --> 01:44:32,294
under 10 fathoms of green water...

1466
01:44:32,759 --> 01:44:34,917
all alone in a dead ship...

1467
01:44:35,553 --> 01:44:39,799
where the shark and the giant squid
swim through the dark shadows.

1468
01:44:40,683 --> 01:44:44,301
It wasn't the ship that screamed, Dan.
It was a woman.

1469
01:44:44,895 --> 01:44:46,472
Maybe Drusilla.

1470
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:50,185
- And you know the men who...
- Don't answer.

1471
01:44:50,567 --> 01:44:51,729
Your Honour, this...

1472
01:44:51,818 --> 01:44:54,772
They'd like to silence you
the way they silenced Widgeon.

1473
01:44:54,863 --> 01:44:58,066
It isn't me they're afraid of, Dan. It's you...

1474
01:44:58,157 --> 01:45:00,565
because you know who is guilty.

1475
01:45:01,619 --> 01:45:03,196
If Drusilla's under that sea...

1476
01:45:03,287 --> 01:45:05,778
I'll send the men who put her there
straight to hell.

1477
01:45:05,873 --> 01:45:07,782
Even your own brother?

1478
01:45:09,668 --> 01:45:11,542
Even my own brother.

1479
01:45:13,797 --> 01:45:18,542
All day we've heard the prosecution
present a mass of lying insinuations...

1480
01:45:18,677 --> 01:45:21,594
based on evidence which cannot be shown.

1481
01:45:21,721 --> 01:45:25,304
<i>Now i challenge Mr. Tolliver
to produce this evidence.</i>

1482
01:45:25,391 --> 01:45:29,436
I challenge Mr. Tolliver himself
to dive to that sunken hull...

1483
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,355
to bring up the proof he claims is there.

1484
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:35,393
Mr. Cutler, such a dive is impossible.

1485
01:45:35,526 --> 01:45:38,859
If murder has been done,
this court must know it.

1486
01:45:39,154 --> 01:45:41,692
I will undertake to find
an experienced diver...

1487
01:45:41,781 --> 01:45:44,070
to show Mr. Tolliver the way.

1488
01:45:44,409 --> 01:45:47,279
I cannot order men to almost certain death.

1489
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:49,161
You don't have to.

1490
01:45:50,665 --> 01:45:54,745
That dive is not impossible. I'll make it.

1491
01:45:56,921 --> 01:45:59,838
Mr. Tolliver would be a madman to accept.

1492
01:46:01,383 --> 01:46:04,384
Perhaps, Your Honour, but I have no choice.

1493
01:46:05,262 --> 01:46:09,094
<i>I move that this court be adjourned
to the wreck of the Southern Cross.</i>

1494
01:46:09,182 --> 01:46:13,595
- Consarn it! You lost your reason?
- Judge Marvin, you can't let them.

1495
01:46:16,522 --> 01:46:20,602
<i>This court stands adjourned
to the wreck of the Southern Cross.</i>

1496
01:46:39,335 --> 01:46:43,380
Stars alive. You men calculating
to take all day with that rig?

1497
01:46:43,464 --> 01:46:46,798
I don't know,
I can't get no air through the hose.

1498
01:46:49,345 --> 01:46:53,294
- Try taking your foot off it. Might help some.
- Maybe so.

1499
01:46:55,517 --> 01:46:59,894
- How soon you reckon that squall will hit?
- Too soon.

1500
01:47:01,189 --> 01:47:05,898
Capt. Stuart, the court warns you
that what you may find down there...

1501
01:47:05,985 --> 01:47:08,274
may well cost you your life.

1502
01:47:10,698 --> 01:47:11,978
Thanks.

1503
01:47:22,292 --> 01:47:24,617
If that girl is down there...

1504
01:47:24,878 --> 01:47:26,586
come back alone.

1505
01:47:41,352 --> 01:47:44,436
That far down, light won't be much.

1506
01:47:46,857 --> 01:47:51,186
If she's there,
you'll see that red and yellow shawl.

1507
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:58,991
That fool brother of mine will hang us all.

1508
01:48:00,328 --> 01:48:03,245
Does that tell you what to do down there?

1509
01:48:04,624 --> 01:48:06,581
<i>Lubbock knows his business.</i>

1510
01:48:06,667 --> 01:48:09,952
If the girl is there, signal with your lifeline.

1511
01:48:10,337 --> 01:48:12,081
Two, one, two, one.

1512
01:48:13,757 --> 01:48:16,544
Tolliver's air hose will break at the pump.

1513
01:48:16,635 --> 01:48:18,461
Ready to lower away.

1514
01:48:27,353 --> 01:48:29,262
Jack, I'm afraid.

1515
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,476
Here, take my southwester.

1516
01:48:36,028 --> 01:48:40,654
When the squall strikes,
it'll take the curl out of your hair.

1517
01:48:42,659 --> 01:48:44,817
Whatever's down there, Jack...

1518
01:48:44,911 --> 01:48:48,327
don't add another crime
to what we've done already.

1519
01:48:54,754 --> 01:48:57,838
I'll bring you a rainbow fish for breakfast.

1520
01:48:58,382 --> 01:49:00,458
Come on with that helmet.

1521
01:49:05,222 --> 01:49:09,930
- Better keep one eye on that pump, man.
- Yes, and the other one on Cutler.

1522
01:49:11,102 --> 01:49:12,929
I see. I thought so.

1523
01:49:19,318 --> 01:49:22,818
Good luck, Steve. Try and forgive me.

1524
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:28,490
Forgive you? Loxi, I...

1525
01:49:32,247 --> 01:49:36,197
If I should happen to be late for supper,
just see that Romulus doesn't overeat.

1526
01:49:36,293 --> 01:49:40,124
There's a squall coming up.
It won't give you many minutes.

1527
01:49:40,755 --> 01:49:43,922
Yes, and Romulus doesn't like
fish much, either.

1528
01:49:45,176 --> 01:49:46,207
Steve.

1529
01:49:50,306 --> 01:49:52,382
Bolt the faceplate home.

1530
01:50:57,327 --> 01:51:00,197
The wreck moved!
It dropped another fathom!

1531
01:51:00,288 --> 01:51:03,988
- Are they coming up?
- No. He's signalling for more line.

1532
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,874
He's starting to signal.

1533
01:53:42,899 --> 01:53:44,357
Hold him down, Sam!

1534
01:53:44,442 --> 01:53:47,395
He never finished the signal.
Tie him up!

1535
01:54:22,894 --> 01:54:24,602
Help!

1536
01:57:53,925 --> 01:57:57,590
Both lifelines are fouled! Yield slack!

1537
01:57:58,221 --> 01:57:59,929
Look!
Pay out!

1538
01:58:00,348 --> 01:58:02,424
There's ink coming up
from the hatches!

1539
01:58:02,517 --> 01:58:05,766
- That there's from a giant squid.
- Squid? Where?

1540
01:58:11,775 --> 01:58:13,400
Hold fast, men!

1541
01:58:14,361 --> 01:58:16,686
<i>- Get them up!
- It's a marejada!</i>

1542
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:19,946
<i>A marejada!
LOXl: Get the men up! Get them up!</i>

1543
01:58:20,033 --> 01:58:21,942
Cast off that hawser!

1544
01:58:35,589 --> 01:58:37,498
Cut that hawser!

1545
01:58:42,763 --> 01:58:46,131
All hands to the lifeline!
Keep them pumps working!

1546
01:58:46,224 --> 01:58:48,133
A lifeline has carried away.

1547
01:58:48,226 --> 01:58:50,895
- One of them is lost with the wreck!
- One's coming up.

1548
01:58:50,979 --> 01:58:53,766
Who is it? Which one?
Can't tell yet.

1549
01:58:54,107 --> 01:58:57,356
Steady on them air pumps there.
Keep them going.

1550
01:58:58,652 --> 01:59:01,190
I can see a body. Heave ho!

1551
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:05,610
Easy now. Don't smash him
up against the hull.

1552
01:59:06,451 --> 01:59:08,029
I can see the steel helmet.

1553
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:10,741
That's Tolliver.
Keep that hose clear!

1554
01:59:10,830 --> 01:59:12,989
LOXl: Steve.
They got Tolliver.

1555
01:59:14,834 --> 01:59:16,743
Keep his head upright!

1556
01:59:17,086 --> 01:59:19,079
All hands, haul him in!

1557
01:59:19,881 --> 01:59:21,672
Lift him over now.

1558
01:59:22,466 --> 01:59:26,215
Control his feet.
Careful, now. Set him down.

1559
01:59:27,263 --> 01:59:29,421
Faceplate ain't broke, is it?
No.

1560
01:59:30,849 --> 01:59:32,474
Steady does it, now.

1561
01:59:37,063 --> 01:59:39,103
Rub the back of his neck, Dave.

1562
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:40,898
Take off that belt, Sam.

1563
01:59:40,984 --> 01:59:44,898
Is he badly hurt?
Looks like that squid tore him up a bit.

1564
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:48,405
- Where's...
- Now you just take it easy, son.

1565
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:51,776
We're all right glad to see you.

1566
01:59:51,869 --> 01:59:55,403
Just wait till you get your wind
before you tell us what happened.

1567
01:59:55,497 --> 01:59:59,791
- Where's Jack Stuart? Did you get him up?
- No, his lifeline parted.

1568
02:00:01,002 --> 02:00:02,912
He could've got away.

1569
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:08,007
He stayed down to save my life.
It cost him his own.

1570
02:00:08,092 --> 02:00:10,251
He went down with his ship.

1571
02:00:11,512 --> 02:00:14,430
Steve, did you find...

1572
02:00:16,017 --> 02:00:17,676
Was Drusilla...

1573
02:00:27,235 --> 02:00:29,560
That's the answer, all right.

1574
02:00:47,463 --> 02:00:49,206
Look at it, King.

1575
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:51,629
- You did this.
- Shut up, you fool.

1576
02:00:51,717 --> 02:00:54,421
That wreck was yours. You planned it.

1577
02:00:54,928 --> 02:00:57,882
You put her on the rocks
the same as you did 100 others!

1578
02:00:57,972 --> 02:01:00,048
Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.

1579
02:01:00,141 --> 02:01:04,055
I'll shut up when I see you hung,
and not before.

1580
02:01:04,187 --> 02:01:05,930
You won't see it.

1581
02:01:06,272 --> 02:01:07,647
He shot him!

1582
02:01:07,732 --> 02:01:09,060
Look out, King!

1583
02:01:14,696 --> 02:01:17,022
Look out! He's shooting again!

1584
02:01:20,952 --> 02:01:23,787
He's done for.
Yeah. Serves him right.

1585
02:01:28,459 --> 02:01:32,753
I sworn, that's the first time
I ever known that thing could shoot.

1586
02:01:36,175 --> 02:01:38,049
This is all my doing.

1587
02:01:39,887 --> 02:01:41,630
Tell Drusilla...

1588
02:01:43,056 --> 02:01:45,630
I have a pretty shawl for her.

1589
02:01:55,526 --> 02:01:57,483
Drusilla loved him so.

1590
02:02:05,953 --> 02:02:09,571
What's the matter, dog? Is you busted?

1591
02:02:09,915 --> 02:02:12,038
No, ma'am. I'm just shy.

1592
02:02:18,006 --> 02:02:21,837
They seem to be having a little trouble
getting acquainted.

1593
02:02:25,554 --> 02:02:26,930
So did we.

1594
02:02:31,852 --> 02:02:33,015
Yes.

1595
02:02:34,305 --> 02:03:34,297
