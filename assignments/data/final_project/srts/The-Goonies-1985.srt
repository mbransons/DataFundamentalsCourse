1
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,800
Lunchtime!

2
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,263
The longer you animals bark,
the colder your lunch gets.

3
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:49,141
Come on, move it out.
You too, down there!

4
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:50,392
Hey, turkey!

5
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:08,452
"You schmuck.

6
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,497
Do you think I'd be stupid enough
to kill myself?" Kill myself?

7
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,524
Come on!

8
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:47,991
Here he comes.

9
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,334
Francis, the lock.

10
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:58,669
Let go of the handle.

11
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:00,837
I don't have the handle! Open it!

12
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,214
Jake, up!

13
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,675
Come on, move! Get on!

14
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:07,219
Thanks, Mama.

15
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,894
Okay, you guys.
Let's try the victory pyramid.

16
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,062
Okay, let's go.

17
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:03,400
Come on. Put your arms up.

18
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,485
Smile. Good, we got it!

19
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,964
Turn that TV off.
I can't hear myself think.

20
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:27,633
Yeah, right, Dad.

21
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:37,184
Is the water going down, son?

22
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:40,103
- Nope.
- Is it going down now?

23
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:13,512
Wow, a police chase!

24
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,061
Oh, shit!

25
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,864
What are we doing here?

26
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,825
Trust in your mother, boys.

27
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:38,370
Throw her into four-wheel drive
and hold on to your hats.

28
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,045
Bummer!

29
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:32,299
Nothing exciting ever happens
around here anyway.

30
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:33,926
Who needs the Goon Docks?

31
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:38,388
Who needs this house?
I can't wait to get out of here.

32
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,058
Really?

33
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,270
No, I was just trying to delate
myself. No, no....

34
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,067
Dictate myself.

35
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,486
That's delude yourself, dummy.

36
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:54,279
That's what I said.

37
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:02,871
Thanks, Brand.

38
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,166
I know how you feel, wimp.

39
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,253
I'm sure gonna miss this place too.

40
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,094
Adopted wuss.

41
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:17,719
I'm no adopted wuss!

42
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,847
I'll kill you, Brand!

43
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,768
It's Mouth.

44
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,104
Hey, Mikey.

45
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,523
Yo, Mikey.

46
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:32,943
Hey, Mikey, seen Adrienne?

47
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:35,946
- What's going down?
- Get your foot off the table.

48
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:38,532
You got it. What's going down, guys?

49
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:41,118
What's the matter with you guys?

50
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:44,037
What's the matter? What is this?
A nuclear Saturday?

51
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:45,622
Come on, guys.

52
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,958
This is our last weekend together.

53
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,960
Last Goonie weekend.

54
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,629
We gotta be going out in style.

55
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:56,633
Cruising the coast,
sniffing some lace...

56
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:59,803
...downing the brews, but no!

57
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:03,223
The one older brother had to go
and screw it up.

58
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,812
Flunking your driver's test?
I don't know what to do with you.

59
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:11,148
You guys, let me in!

60
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:12,482
Jerk alert.

61
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,651
It's Chunk.

62
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:18,739
I just saw the most amazing thing
in my entire life!

63
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:20,699
First, do the Truffle Shuffle.

64
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,534
Come on!

65
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,202
Do it.

66
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,704
Come on!

67
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,080
Do it!

68
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:36,256
Cut it out, Mouth.

69
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,384
Get out.

70
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,289
Thanks a lot.
You, guys, you won't believe me.

71
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,208
I'm telling the truth.

72
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,292
You turd!

73
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,169
- Flunked your driver's test.
- Shut up.

74
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:18,423
Listen, you'll never believe me.
There was two cop cars, okay?

75
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,635
They were chasing this four-wheel
deal, a real neat ORV.

76
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:25,889
Bullets flying everywhere. It was
the most amazing thing I ever saw!

77
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:29,726
More amazing than when
Michael Jackson used your bathroom?

78
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:33,522
More amazing than when you saved
those old people from that fire?

79
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,484
More amazing than when you ate your
weight in Godfather's pizza?

80
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:42,239
Okay, Michael Jackson didn't come to
my house to use the bathroom.

81
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:43,574
But his sister did.

82
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,120
Okay, Data, don't mess this one up.

83
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,582
Prepare for the Wings of Flight.

84
00:08:57,796 --> 00:08:59,506
- Open the door!
- Mikey!

85
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:00,591
The screen door!

86
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:10,183
Hey! I bet you guys thought l
was gonna drop it, huh?

87
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,644
I know you'd expect that from Chunk.

88
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,062
- You idiot!
- Oh, my God!

89
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:19,693
Look, it's not broken.
It's perfect.

90
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,654
- Oh, my God!
- What?

91
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:26,116
- That's my mom's most favorite piece!
- What?

92
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:28,452
Oh, my God.

93
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,787
- You wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- Shut up!

94
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:31,830
Shut up, Mouth.

95
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,666
- Any of you guys ever hear of Detroit?
- No.

96
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,920
Certainly. It's where Motown started.

97
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,172
Also got the country's
highest murder rate.

98
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,467
That's where we move to when we
lose our house tomorrow.

99
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:46,720
Shut up. It'll never
happen. My dad'll fix it.

100
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,722
Yeah, sure he will.

101
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,725
If he gets his next 400 paychecks
by tomorrow.

102
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,478
That's wrong, Brand.
It won't happen!

103
00:09:58,232 --> 00:09:59,733
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

104
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,777
Hi, hi!

105
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,987
I see Data dropped by.

106
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:06,573
Hi, Mrs. Walsh. How are you?

107
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:09,701
Boys, this is Rosalita.

108
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,455
She'll help with the packing until
my arm's better.

109
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:19,503
Boys, Rosalita doesn't speak a word
of English...

110
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:22,172
...and I know some of you took
Spanish in school.

111
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:25,968
Well, Mrs. Walsh, I speak
perfect Spanish.

112
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:30,264
If it's any help to you, I'd be glad
to communicate with Rosalita.

113
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:33,225
You're a lifesaver, Clark.
Come with us, will you?

114
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,102
Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.

115
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,147
Mikey, no more potato chips.
Hello, Mikey.

116
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,274
It's Brand, Ma.

117
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:46,029
What?

118
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,034
I wonder if she'll notice.

119
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,452
That's what I said!

120
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:54,705
Of course. She notices everything.

121
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:57,207
Pants and shirts are in the second.

122
00:10:57,374 --> 00:11:01,420
Just throw them all into boxes.
Forget the suitcases.

123
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,171
Can you translate that?

124
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,758
- Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
- That's wonderful.

125
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,064
Look. How's that?

126
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:24,276
You idiot!
You glued it on upside down!

127
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,529
If God meant it that way,
you'd be pissing in your faces.

128
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:28,906
Looks fine to me.

129
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:34,119
Rosalita, this is the attic.
Mr. Walsh doesn't like anyone up here.

130
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,871
That's why it's always open.

131
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:53,096
This is my supply closet. You'll
find brooms, dustpans, insect spray.

132
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:56,266
I'd like the house clean
when they tear it down.

133
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,310
Clark, can you translate?

134
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:12,449
Okay, Rosie? You're gonna be
very happy here.

135
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:16,745
Come on, Clark, we've got more to do.
You're so fluent in languages.

136
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:23,669
You're so fluent in Spanish.
That was so nice of you.

137
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,796
"Nice" is my middle name.

138
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:28,715
I'm taking Rosalita
to the supermarket.

139
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:30,842
I'll be back in about an hour.

140
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:36,306
Mikey, stay inside. Brand, if he has
asthma, I don't want him in the rain.

141
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:38,350
He should be in a plastic bubble.

142
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,852
I'm serious. That's not funny.

143
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:45,524
He takes one step outside, and you
are in absolutely the deepest...

144
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,775
Shit, Ma.

145
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:49,778
I don't like that language,
but that's what you'll be in.

146
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:51,947
- And you, Data...
- "Data".

147
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:54,908
- Use the back door from now on.
- All right.

148
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,494
What is that?

149
00:12:57,995 --> 00:12:59,413
Oh, shit. What?

150
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:02,124
What is that?

151
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,502
That is a mess.
I want it cleaned up, boys.

152
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,380
- Oh, yeah. Sure!
- You got it.

153
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:11,717
One hour and I'll be back.
Bye, baby. Rosie?

154
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,927
- Bye, Mrs. Walsh.
- Bye.

155
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:22,603
You want a breathing problem?
You got one.

156
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:25,314
What'll happen to the stuff
in the attic?

157
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,357
My dad's giving it back
to the museum...

158
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:31,111
...or the new assistant curly...
Curney...

159
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:32,571
- Curator.
- Wait, guys.

160
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,534
Maybe there's stuff up there for us
that we can keep from the oldsiders.

161
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:39,912
Maybe there's some rich stuff!

162
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:45,208
No! It's my dad's responsibility,
you guys.

163
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,252
The museum's probably got a list.

164
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,546
Listen to me! That's his stuff!

165
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:59,306
Look at this. I didn't know Dad
had all this stuff up here.

166
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:03,727
- Great! Look at that! Neat!
- I love it.

167
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,521
Come on, guys!

168
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,066
My dad doesn't want you up here.

169
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:13,153
You heard what my mom said
about not wanting anybody up here.

170
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:17,741
I cannot believe you actually have
something this cool in your house.

171
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,284
You guys, my mom said...

172
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:21,703
Guys, stop. Put down
the outfit, okay?

173
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:25,499
This is great. We only have Hanukkah
decorations in our attic.

174
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:27,876
I don't care what you have in your...

175
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:34,091
Okay, you saw it, now let's go.

176
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,843
Come on, Mikey. It's cool!

177
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,721
I got you right where I want you!

178
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,226
It's dusty, my hay fever's acting up
and you always break something.

179
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:45,352
Mikey!

180
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:47,396
Come here and make me feel
like a woman.

181
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:50,065
Come on, give me a nice, wet,
lickery kiss.

182
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:55,070
I gotcha! Get out from there,
you're ruining the painting!

183
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,115
You're ruining my joke.
The painting's already cracked.

184
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,372
- Hey, Mikey?
- What?

185
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:07,165
What is all this stuff?

186
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,209
The museum did some...
Where'd you get this?

187
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:12,087
- Right there.
- They did a show. A retropactum.

188
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:15,883
- Retrospective.
- I said that. Don't contradict me.

189
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:20,429
It was about the history of Astoria,
and these are the rejects.

190
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,390
Kind of like us, the Goonies.

191
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,892
I'm not a reject.

192
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,811
Take that off.
You'll get me in trouble.

193
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,814
- You know how this works?
- What?

194
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:32,858
Laser beams!

195
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:38,155
Mouth, when you drop something,
put it back up...

196
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,240
What's this?

197
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,284
Wait a second.

198
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,092
Chunk!

199
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,677
I didn't touch it.

200
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,262
I know. Get over here.

201
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,102
Hold this.

202
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:10,854
Why me, Mike?

203
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:13,774
Thanks for taking us up here.
There's a real big ball...

204
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:15,400
...and it's got this thing...

205
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,116
What are you doing?

206
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,201
Mike found a map.

207
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,663
And look. That says "1632".

208
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:29,122
Is that a year?

209
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:31,333
No. It's your top score
on Pole Position.

210
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,545
Yes, it's a year.
It's a map of our coastline.

211
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:37,631
What's all that Spanish junk
right there?

212
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,551
Mouth, you said you can translate.
Translate.

213
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,843
Yeah, translate it.

214
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:47,224
"Ye intruders beware.

215
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,977
Crushing death and grief...

216
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:55,691
...soaked with blood
of the trespassing thief".

217
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,943
This map is old news.

218
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:02,614
Everybody went looking for that
when our parents were our age.

219
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,741
Haven't you heard of him?
What's his name?

220
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,369
The pirate guy. One-Eyed Willy.

221
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,956
One-Eyed Willy!

222
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:15,460
The most famous pirate in his time.
My dad told me all about him.

223
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:18,005
Dad'll do anything
to put you to sleep.

224
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,884
No! See, One-Eyed Willy
stole a treasure once.

225
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:24,928
And it was full of rubies
and emeralds...

226
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:26,096
And diamonds?

227
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:30,309
And diamonds. Then he loaded it
onto his ship...

228
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,644
...and sailed away into the sunset.

229
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,314
Until the British king found out
about it...

230
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:39,026
...and sent out his whole armada
to go after him.

231
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:42,905
It took them a couple of weeks
to catch up with Willy.

232
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:45,908
Then there was a whole big war...

233
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:49,453
...between the armada
and Willy's ship, the Inferno.

234
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:51,538
During the firefight, there were...

235
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:54,541
...guns and cannons bursting
here and there.

236
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,171
Then Willy fled, because he knew
he'd get killed if he stayed around.

237
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,632
And then he got into this cave...

238
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,676
...and the British blew up
the walls around him.

239
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:07,554
He got caved in,
and he's been there ever since.

240
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:08,764
- Forever?
- Forever.

241
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:09,973
And ever?

242
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:11,808
Trapped.

243
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:16,063
You sound as corny as Dad does.

244
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:19,191
My dad tells the truth.
Know what he said?

245
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:23,362
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch
were down there for years.

246
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,573
They were digging tunnels and caves.

247
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:28,700
- Setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

248
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:32,412
Setting booby traps so anybody who
tried to get in would die.

249
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:34,373
Then he killed all his men.

250
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,333
- Why?
- Why kill all of them?

251
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,252
So they wouldn't get his treasure.

252
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,170
Wait a minute.

253
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:43,715
If he killed all his men,
how did the map get out?

254
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:48,220
My dad said one of the guys must
have gotten out with the map.

255
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:52,516
- Hey, Mikey, I believe you.
- I don't believe you at all.

256
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,895
What did you break this time, Chunk?

257
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,441
Hey, you guys, look at this.

258
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,859
You ever hear of this guy?

259
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:05,654
Chester Copperpot.
Look what it says.

260
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:10,867
"Chester Copperpot, missing while
in pursuit of local legend.

261
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:15,539
Reclusive scavenger claims,
'l have the key...

262
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:19,126
...to One-Eyed Willy".

263
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:22,212
Wow, do you guys realize
what we could do?

264
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:26,758
Nobody ever found nothing.
Why would this map be in this attic...

265
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,720
...when it could be in some
safe-deposit box, right?

266
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:34,725
Right. If Chester Copperpot didn't
find it, how would we find it?

267
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,561
But what if? You guys...

268
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:42,316
...what if this map can lead
to One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff?

269
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:43,984
We wouldn't have to leave
the Goon Docks.

270
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,319
Come on, Mike.

271
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:48,989
I don't want to go on any more
of your Goonie adventures.

272
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,952
Where are you going?
You don't want to do this?

273
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,585
1 632.

274
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:06,924
Jerk alert.

275
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:07,966
Can I help you?

276
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:11,428
Hello, little guys.
I'm Mr. Perkins, Troy's father.

277
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:14,014
We know Troy, he's a cheap guy.

278
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:15,766
My dad's not home, Mr. Perkins.

279
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:17,893
Is your mommy here?

280
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:22,272
No, she's down at the market buying
Pampers for all us kids.

281
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:25,734
Papers.

282
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:30,447
Well, you can give these papers to
your father to read through and sign.

283
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:33,325
We'll be by to pick them up
in the morning.

284
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,743
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

285
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,792
- What is that?
- It's Dad's business.

286
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,126
But what is it?

287
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,671
I told you it was Dad's business.

288
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,216
Look at them smiling.

289
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:54,263
They can't wait till tomorrow
to foreclose on whatever it's called.

290
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:55,931
Trash the Goon Docks.

291
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:58,183
I hope they make our house
a sand trap.

292
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,435
And never get their balls out.

293
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:05,482
You know, I think they made me
lose my appetite.

294
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:36,680
Come on, before you catch a real cold.

295
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,312
You're sure of yourself.

296
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,397
The foreclosure is a definite.

297
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:51,737
Oh, God, am I depressed.

298
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:57,659
If I found One-Eyed Willy's rich
stuff, I'd pay all my dad's bills.

299
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:59,995
Then he could sleep at night...

300
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:02,664
...instead of sitting up
figuring how we can stay.

301
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:04,458
- Me too.
- Me three.

302
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,168
Forget any adventures, limp lungs.

303
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:10,088
If I let you out, Mom will ground
me, and I've got a date with Andy.

304
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:13,050
You're dreaming, dude. No way.

305
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:17,304
Her mom has to drive, and then you
gotta make it with her and her mom.

306
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,181
- Shut up, Mouth.
- Yeah, Mouth.

307
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:21,058
Shut up, Data.

308
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:24,728
Jesus!

309
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:32,236
What'll we do about that country club?
It's killing our parents.

310
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,947
If we don't do something...

311
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,950
...there'll be a golf course
where we're standing.

312
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,074
Brand, how far can you stretch that?

313
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,159
It's not that hard.

314
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:23,787
Get off me, Chunk.

315
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:26,540
- Get off me!
- I got you.

316
00:23:36,758 --> 00:23:37,634
What are you doing?

317
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:41,138
It took his 376 lawn mowing jobs
to pay for it.

318
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:42,890
It's his favorite thing in the world.

319
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:45,100
Now it's his flattest.
Let's go!

320
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:49,313
I'll hit you so hard, when you wake
your clothes will be out of style!

321
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,501
Mom. You've got to let me
out of here.

322
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:15,464
Can't you learn how to exercise
like a normal kid?

323
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:20,385
Look! You're hyperventrilicating.
Where's your brother?

324
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,221
Mom!

325
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,056
What's wrong with you people?

326
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:25,515
Rosalita, come here.

327
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:28,101
You gotta let me out of here.
Rosalita!

328
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,690
Rosalita, come here.
You gotta let me out of this.

329
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:41,865
- Hi, Mikey.
- Hi, Dad!

330
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:44,117
Hey, wait for me!

331
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:55,337
If you don't bring your brother home,
I'll commit Hare Krishna!

332
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:56,964
That's hara-kiri, Ma.

333
00:24:57,172 --> 00:25:00,342
- That's exactly what I said.
- What?

334
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:04,805
My new tires!
They popped my new tires, the son of...

335
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:06,348
I'm gonna kill...

336
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:12,479
- My bike! My bike!
- I owe you one.

337
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:14,565
He's got my bike! I want my bike!

338
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,737
Gold Rock Beach is around
this next curve.

339
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:23,115
I have a feeling about this.

340
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,577
Every time you have feeling,
we get in trouble.

341
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:30,247
You're the one who always gets us
in trouble, 00-Negative.

342
00:25:30,455 --> 00:25:32,499
I'm James Bond, 007, not 00-Negative.

343
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:36,336
I'm hungry. When my stomach growls,
there's trouble.

344
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:37,629
Shut up, Chunk!

345
00:25:38,547 --> 00:25:43,552
You made me go up this big
hill and said give me a Twinkie.

346
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,471
I'll be late for dinner,
and my mom'll yell at me.

347
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,726
She's not gonna let me eat dinner,
and she's gonna punish me!

348
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:55,606
Anybody got a candy bar?
A Baby Ruth?

349
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,444
I can't believe it. That's it.

350
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:03,447
Those three rocks out there.
One, two, three.

351
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:21,548
Troy! You touch that mirror again,
and I'll smack you in the face.

352
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:24,301
There's Brand.

353
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:26,303
Like the bike.

354
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:27,971
What is he doing?

355
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,140
No wonder he can't get a license.

356
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:33,644
Oh, no.

357
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,819
Brand, can we give you
a ride somewhere?

358
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:45,572
No. Thanks anyway.

359
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:49,159
Walsh, let us give you a little ride.

360
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,870
Hold on. Here we go!

361
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:54,414
- Troy!
- Let go of my arm!

362
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:58,669
Oh, no.

363
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,051
Let go of my hand!

364
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:08,929
Oh, my God!

365
00:27:09,137 --> 00:27:10,722
So long, sucker!

366
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:26,530
- Forget it!
- Come on!

367
00:27:28,574 --> 00:27:31,577
- This better be it, Mikey.
- Shut up, Chunk.

368
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:37,457
Guys?

369
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:42,754
I think I have a match.
I'm sure of it.

370
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:47,175
The lighthouse, the rock and
the restaurant all fit the doubloon.

371
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:51,430
That must mean the rich stuff
is near the restaurant.

372
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:53,348
Wait a second.

373
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:57,686
Mouth, I need you to translate.
I don't understand Spanish.

374
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:00,355
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

375
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,902
- What's that?
- 10 times 10.

376
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,069
A hundred.

377
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:07,446
"Stretching feet...

378
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:10,407
...to nearest northern point".

379
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:15,412
- Which way is north?
- "That's where you'll find the treat".

380
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:18,415
That's it!

381
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:19,708
- That's north.
- Near the restaurant.

382
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:26,131
One, two, three, four,
five...

383
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,718
...six, seven, eight, nine....

384
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,811
Wait a minute. Somebody's there.

385
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:47,903
Sixty and another 40 is an even 100.

386
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:50,948
Right to the restaurant.
The rich stuff is there.

387
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:53,659
I don't know about it, Mikey.

388
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:56,495
It's getting late.

389
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:59,915
That's a summer place.
Why is it open in the fall?

390
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:05,045
There's nothing to be scared of.
Two customers went inside the place.

391
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:08,507
What if they're not customers?
What if they're drug dealers?

392
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,634
Drug dealers?

393
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,974
Did you see their clothes? Drug
dealers don't wear polyester rags.

394
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:23,855
Mikey, Mikey!
That sounded like gunshots.

395
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:28,485
Not the kind you hear in movies,
but real ones. They're gonna kill us.

396
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:31,780
Turn off your brain.
Somebody dropped a pot.

397
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:32,990
Yeah, a pot!

398
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:38,161
Are you sure, Mikey?
Because if you're sure, I'm sure.

399
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,832
If it's not the pots,
they might try to kill us.

400
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,793
They're gonna kill us!

401
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:48,422
Chunk, shut up!

402
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,643
Soda pop! Boy, am I thirsty!

403
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,228
Damn it!

404
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,855
What's that?

405
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:06,857
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

406
00:30:09,192 --> 00:30:11,445
The cook is carrying something
to the kitchen.

407
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:13,322
Yeah, food.

408
00:30:13,697 --> 00:30:14,823
Don't let them see us.

409
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,293
ORV.

410
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:28,587
Bullet holes.

411
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:31,757
Bullet holes?!

412
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:39,723
Shut up, Chunk.

413
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:48,357
This is a summer restaurant? I bet
it hasn't been open in 10 summers.

414
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:51,360
How long you boys been at that window?

415
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:56,031
Long enough to see you need about
400 roach motels in this place.

416
00:30:57,241 --> 00:31:01,078
How am I supposed to create
with that Smithsonian piece of shit?!

417
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:13,632
Jake, these boys are customers.

418
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:28,480
Boys...

419
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:31,525
...make yourselves comfortable, huh?

420
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:37,239
She's gonna cook you something.

421
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:39,366
What do you want?

422
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:42,744
- Lots of water.
- Water, water, water.

423
00:31:42,911 --> 00:31:45,581
Four waters. Is that all?

424
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:47,207
No.

425
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:49,710
I want veal scallopini.

426
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:52,629
I want a good fettucini Alfredo.

427
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,050
A bottle of fettucine, 1981.

428
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,263
The only thing we serve is tongue.

429
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:08,729
You boys like tongue?

430
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:14,818
That's all?

431
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,489
Sit down!

432
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:24,578
Are you all right, Chunk?

433
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:27,748
Hey, guys.

434
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:32,252
What happened to the two guys
in the polyester who came before us?

435
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:35,297
- What happened to them?
- What is it? Spit it out.

436
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:37,799
You guys, if we don't
get out of here soon...

437
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:41,220
...there's gonna be
some kind of hostage crisis.

438
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,934
Out in the garage, ORV,
four-wheel drive...

439
00:32:47,142 --> 00:32:49,269
...bullet holes the size of matzo ba...

440
00:32:49,478 --> 00:32:53,607
Chunk, I'm starting to O.D.
on all your bullshit stories.

441
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:56,318
Here's your water.

442
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:58,737
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am.

443
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:00,030
I mean "ma'am".

444
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,949
This is supposed to be water?

445
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:04,034
It's wet, isn't it? Drink it!

446
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:05,953
Where's the men's room, please?

447
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:07,788
- Can't you hold it?
- No.

448
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:12,042
Mikey, this ain't the kind of place
you want to go to the bathroom in.

449
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:14,044
Why not?

450
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:16,964
Because they might have
daddy longlegs in them.

451
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:20,175
- But I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Like dead things, Mikey.

452
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,428
Hey, Mikey, gotta go to the bathroom?

453
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:26,515
- Killer dead things. Big. Please.
- Lady, please!

454
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:29,393
- Downstairs, first door on the right.
- Thank you.

455
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:32,521
- Stay to the right!
- Please, Mikey, dead things.

456
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:34,231
Stay to the right!

457
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:36,900
I know it's to the right, thank you.

458
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:45,242
I know you're down here,
One-Eyed Willy. You've gotta be.

459
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,413
I can feel it, One-Eyed Willy.
I know you're down here.

460
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,210
Oh, man, that stinks.

461
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,465
What the hell is that?

462
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:21,737
You're ruining it!
Look at the feast I made you.

463
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:24,448
Look at the feast I made you.
Want to eat it?

464
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:28,952
Have some. You'll get something.
You don't leave me any choice.

465
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:30,871
You don't leave me any choice!

466
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:36,752
You're just like Mom and Francis.
You never let me finish.

467
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:30,764
Why can't you stay at home?
I'm taking you out of here right now.

468
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:32,391
Let's get out of here!

469
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:35,060
Get out of here!

470
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:38,438
And stay out!

471
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:48,031
Kids suck.

472
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,036
I swear on my life, they've got it.

473
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:56,373
An It! A giant It!
They got it chained to the wall!

474
00:35:56,582 --> 00:36:00,294
- The parts were all mixed around.
- Like your brain?

475
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,006
Say goodbye to your pals.

476
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:04,631
Hey, look at that.

477
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,594
- Ma, why'd you have to shoot him?
- He's a fed.

478
00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:12,681
We could've taken him to the side
of a road and shot him in the brain.

479
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:16,310
- Bring him over here, Francis.
- Don't give me "over here".

480
00:36:16,852 --> 00:36:19,062
I'm wondering, what is in the bag?

481
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:20,898
Restaurant trash. Yeah.

482
00:36:21,106 --> 00:36:23,775
You sure? That big? That much?

483
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:27,154
There were bullet holes
in the car this big.

484
00:36:27,362 --> 00:36:30,073
Mikey, come on,
our parents are worried.

485
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:35,120
- It's dinnertime. Let's go home.
- Home? What home?

486
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:38,373
In a couple more hours
it ain't gonna be home anymore.

487
00:36:38,582 --> 00:36:41,376
Come on, guys, this is our time.

488
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:44,755
Our last chance to see
if there really is any rich stuff.

489
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:48,425
We've got to.

490
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:52,054
Get down, guys. Get down.

491
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:58,352
Oh, shit!

492
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,897
You guys scared me!
Almost gave me a heart attack!

493
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:06,235
- You look better from behind, Mouth.
- Want to see something really scary?

494
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:08,362
How did you get here?

495
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,157
We followed you guys.
We were out driving with Troy.

496
00:37:12,574 --> 00:37:15,994
- Sorry about your face.
- It's okay, I was born with it.

497
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:19,331
- I'm kidding.
- Anyway, he was being a jerk.

498
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,668
Tilting the mirror
so he could look down my shirt.

499
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:26,255
- So I elbowed his lip.
- You elbowed his lip?

500
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:29,591
- It's locked.
- Thank God!

501
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,801
Wait a minute!

502
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:34,680
You know, I got some naked pictures
of your mom, taking a bath.

503
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:36,848
- Want to buy them?
- What?!

504
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:38,684
Real cheap.

505
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:43,564
Thanks, Chunk.

506
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:49,319
- Wait here. I'll get my brother.
- You'll get in trouble.

507
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:52,698
- Just don't leave, all right?
- No way I'm staying here.

508
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:59,955
Shut up! We got to get
to the lowest point of the floor.

509
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:02,541
Lowest point, nothing.
Let's go. Now!

510
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,045
Oh, my God!

511
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:10,257
- No, Brandon.
- Mikey!

512
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:20,893
- Oh, my God.
- It was disgusting.

513
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:24,313
It jumped out from the bushes.
I swear it almost killed us.

514
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:28,191
Please? What if we find something?
A few more minutes won't hurt.

515
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,402
Come on, Mikey, we're going now.

516
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:34,406
- Brand, give them a few minutes.
- Listen to your big brother.

517
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:37,201
As long as you stay here with me.

518
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:41,747
- She knows what she's talking about.
- She's a dame!

519
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:57,012
Chunk, I hope that was your stomach.

520
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,265
That's the It.

521
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:02,726
Sounds like Kong.

522
00:39:03,185 --> 00:39:04,895
Part of it's human.

523
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:07,731
Come on. Want to see it?

524
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,817
Don't worry.
It's chained to the wall.

525
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:30,837
- I don't want to go.
- Why not? It's chained.

526
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,549
- Why not? It's chained.
- You wanted to go.

527
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:35,884
- Yeah, I wanted to go.
- So let's go.

528
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,596
I don't want to see it.

529
00:39:57,698 --> 00:40:00,617
- Shame, shame!
- I know your name.

530
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:03,036
Come on, Brand, slip her the tongue.

531
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:06,039
That's disgusting.
No, I can't even look.

532
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:08,959
Get me up, guys!

533
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,920
One, two, three.

534
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:13,714
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

535
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:17,926
Can't you smell it, guys?
One-Eyed Willy really is down here.

536
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,804
We're walking right above...

537
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:23,640
I'm gonna build one like this one.

538
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:25,225
Water.

539
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:28,687
- Come on, we can do it.
- No, wait a minute.

540
00:40:29,187 --> 00:40:34,067
Right about here must've been when we
said we gotta get to the lowest spot.

541
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:37,195
What are you two talking
to each other about, Mikey?

542
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,742
What the hell are you doing?
You're going to lose your fist!

543
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:44,244
What are you doing? Give me that.

544
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:47,623
There's nothing buried there.
This is the 20th century!

545
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:50,792
- The map says there is.
- Get off it! There's nothing...

546
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,920
Lookit! I got an idea.

547
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:56,924
Let's put chocolate all over the floor
and let Chunk eat through it.

548
00:40:57,132 --> 00:41:00,594
Okay, Mouth, that's all I can stand.

549
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:04,389
And I can't stand no more!
I got it! I got it! I got it!

550
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:08,560
- I don't got it.
- You klutz.

551
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:10,771
Hope it's not a deposit bottle.

552
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,564
This is ridiculous.

553
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:16,109
I feel like I'm babysitting,
except I'm not getting paid.

554
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:18,362
- Listen to that.
- What?

555
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:25,953
Sounds like my grandfather
taking a leak. Thrillsville.

556
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:27,371
No, it's deep.

557
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:31,792
Like there's a hole
or a passageway. Real deep.

558
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:33,627
Get out of the way.

559
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:37,172
- Brand is being so sweet to me.
- Oh, come on!

560
00:41:39,258 --> 00:41:41,510
You're in the clouds,
and we are in a basement!

561
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:47,975
I told you!

562
00:41:48,183 --> 00:41:49,768
Told you! I told you!

563
00:41:52,604 --> 00:41:55,774
I can feel the air.
There's something down there.

564
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:57,943
It might be a treasure or something.

565
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:02,948
Hey, this is working, guys.

566
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:08,036
- Brand, careful!
- Are you okay?

567
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:10,372
I told you there was a passageway.

568
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:13,542
- It's the start of the tunnel.
- Look.

569
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:26,638
Fifty-dollar bill.

570
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:28,140
Fifty-dollar bill. Fifty-dollar bill?

571
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:31,143
Did he say, "Fifty-dollar bill"?

572
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:32,227
Fifty-dollar bills!

573
00:42:34,313 --> 00:42:38,191
Hundreds of them!
We have money to save the Goon Docks!

574
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:46,950
Quiet!

575
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:49,912
They're fake. They're bogus.
They're phony.

576
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,831
I knew these people
were from the ozone.

577
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,084
You get 25 years for counterfeiting!

578
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:59,504
- I recognize these people.
- Look, it's the Fratellis.

579
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:02,341
- He was upstairs!
- The guy who tried to sing.

580
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:04,384
You guys never listen to me.

581
00:43:04,593 --> 00:43:07,721
I said there would be trouble,
but you didn't listen.

582
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,183
You guys are crazy.
You guys are self-destructive.

583
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:14,519
There's a funny farm
with your names written all over it.

584
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,939
But I'm getting out of here. But...

585
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:20,359
I smell ice cream.

586
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,863
They got Swenson's.

587
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,784
They got Pralines and Cream.
And they got Mississippi Mud.

588
00:43:28,992 --> 00:43:31,036
And they got Chocolate Eruption!

589
00:43:31,703 --> 00:43:33,872
And they got apple!

590
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:35,707
And they got grape!

591
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:39,753
They got grape and Super-Duper
Chocolate Eruption and...

592
00:43:39,962 --> 00:43:41,171
What, what?

593
00:43:52,391 --> 00:43:53,850
It's a stiff!

594
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,231
The door!

595
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:16,081
- Somebody's been here. Door's open.
- Shut it.

596
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,917
- I'm gonna leave the lights on.
- Calm down.

597
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:25,424
Pizza.

598
00:44:26,842 --> 00:44:28,427
Pepperoni.

599
00:44:29,887 --> 00:44:33,181
- Ma, he's eating my pepperoni again.
- You want your pepperoni?

600
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,352
Let's kill each other
over the pepperoni.

601
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:40,355
Put that gun away now!

602
00:44:40,856 --> 00:44:42,608
You always take his side.

603
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:44,026
That's right.

604
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,740
Put him back.

605
00:44:56,121 --> 00:44:58,749
- Okay, close the door.
- We can go, guys.

606
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,962
Mikey? Mikey, come on.

607
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:07,341
The fireplace is the only way out.

608
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:10,510
- You guys will never get out that way.
- What?

609
00:45:14,556 --> 00:45:16,642
It all starts here.

610
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:26,485
Guys, I'm stuck with the stiff!

611
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:31,323
Stay. Stay.

612
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:34,409
Guys, come here!
He's in here! Oh, shit.

613
00:45:34,618 --> 00:45:36,995
- Come on, let's go.
- Faster, guys.

614
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,459
- Half the pepperoni was mine.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

615
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:45,837
Help! Help! Help! Guys!

616
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:49,007
- Come on, you idiots!
- Okay, Ma.

617
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:52,844
- I'll make sure it's safe.
- Shut up.

618
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:55,472
- Safe.
- Shut up and go.

619
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:57,099
Hurry up!

620
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:03,021
I'm not kidding! Look in the window!

621
00:46:10,946 --> 00:46:12,781
I'll show you that piece that...

622
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:15,659
He says that all the time.
Watch your head, Ma.

623
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:17,953
- I can't find Chunk.
- Where's Chunk?

624
00:46:20,205 --> 00:46:22,499
- Where's Chunk?
- Chunk's up there.

625
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:26,378
- Look at this piece over here.
- Leave it alone, Jake.

626
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:30,215
Ma, I don't want him to touch it.
I worked two hours on it...

627
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,551
- You worked one.
- Shut up!

628
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,598
Someone's been here. The cooler's
broken. Go check your brother.

629
00:46:37,806 --> 00:46:40,976
- It could've been a tremor, Ma.
- I'll show you a tremor.

630
00:46:42,644 --> 00:46:44,187
I'll go check the brother.

631
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:47,941
If he broke his chains,
I'm not getting any more from the zoo.

632
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,402
- Ma, just don't upset yourself.
- Hurry up!

633
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,364
Gesundheit.

634
00:46:58,827 --> 00:47:00,245
I'm cold.

635
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:05,125
Chunk. Chunk, come here.

636
00:47:06,877 --> 00:47:08,921
What are you doing down there?

637
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:13,759
Go get the police.

638
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:17,179
We're in serious shit here.
You gotta get the police.

639
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:18,847
Don't worry, I can do it.

640
00:47:19,389 --> 00:47:21,308
Go, get out of here.

641
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,939
Watch it... Oh, the window.

642
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:33,445
- Did you see him, guys?
- Where's Chunk?

643
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:36,740
- He went to get the police.
- Go, the Fratellis are there.

644
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:38,825
He's getting the police. Move!

645
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:41,411
See, Ma?
There was nothing to worry about.

646
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,748
I knew he couldn't break them chains.

647
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:45,916
Get the body.

648
00:47:47,084 --> 00:47:50,087
We've been walking forever.
How much further is it?

649
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:52,005
Mouth, you stepped on my foot.

650
00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:54,800
Now I dropped my glasses.
I can't see a thing.

651
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:56,468
Oh, my God.

652
00:47:56,677 --> 00:47:59,137
- I found your glasses. Sorry.
- You broke them.

653
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,223
You broke my glasses!

654
00:48:01,431 --> 00:48:05,227
Listen, I'm the oldest,
so I'm in charge. First, we'll...

655
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:07,521
Data, do you have a light?

656
00:48:07,688 --> 00:48:11,066
I said I was in charge.
Data, do you have a light?

657
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,487
Sure, guys. Back up, back up.

658
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,907
Bully Blinders!

659
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:22,327
- All right, Data... Ow!
- Isn't that neat?

660
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:27,291
One day I was walking home with it,
and two big guys stopped me...

661
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:31,420
Who is that? Oh, Stef, that's you.
Watch out. Data!

662
00:48:31,628 --> 00:48:32,921
Come on, turn it off.

663
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:38,093
Oh, Data. The only problem is
the batteries don't last so long.

664
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:43,181
There's a light up ahead. Maybe we
can get out that way. Let's go.

665
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:47,311
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I like the dark. I love it.

666
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,689
But I hate nature. I hate nature!

667
00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:53,692
Wait a sec! Hold it!

668
00:48:53,942 --> 00:48:56,570
Stop! I'm just a kid!

669
00:48:59,323 --> 00:49:02,326
- What seems to be the problem?
- Mister, I need a ride.

670
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:05,495
My friends and I had
a run-in with disgusting people.

671
00:49:05,704 --> 00:49:09,458
You might've heard of them, the
Fratellis. We found their hideout.

672
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:14,671
Could you take me to the sheriff?
I can describe all three of them.

673
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:39,404
Will you...

674
00:49:42,616 --> 00:49:46,245
What the hell? He's only a kid.
Can't you handle a kid, even?

675
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:50,958
- Does it work, guys?
- Yeah!

676
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:56,838
I can't see. Mouth, your father's
a plumber. What are these pipes?

677
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:59,925
These look like water pipes, guys.

678
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:01,802
Gas pipes.

679
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,640
Drainage. Maybe... Wait a minute.
Shut up for a minute!

680
00:50:06,848 --> 00:50:11,311
These pipes must lead to a building
or something. A foundation.

681
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:15,524
So maybe if we bang on them hard
enough, if we make enough noise....

682
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:52,644
How are you, Duke?

683
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:54,813
- Hey, Gene, how are you?
- Great.

684
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:28,847
Reverse pressure!

685
00:51:35,354 --> 00:51:36,521
Daddy!

686
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,689
- Let's...
- Get out of...

687
00:51:37,898 --> 00:51:39,775
- Here!
- Like now!

688
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:43,987
Go, go, go!

689
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:04,550
First, we start with
the pudgy little fingers.

690
00:52:04,758 --> 00:52:07,261
Then the plump little hands.

691
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,888
Then the fleshy arms.

692
00:52:11,765 --> 00:52:13,976
Now, tell me where your friends are.

693
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:15,185
In the fireplace.

694
00:52:15,394 --> 00:52:16,520
Don't lie to me!

695
00:52:16,728 --> 00:52:20,399
Honestly. We found a map
over at Mikey's dad's place...

696
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,735
...that said there was
buried treasure under here.

697
00:52:23,944 --> 00:52:26,697
Don't give us none of
your bullshit stories, huh?

698
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:30,200
Spill your guts. Tell us everything.

699
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:31,702
Everything?

700
00:52:32,286 --> 00:52:33,245
Everything.

701
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,249
Okay, I'll talk.

702
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:40,919
In 3rd grade,
I cheated on my history exam.

703
00:52:41,128 --> 00:52:44,756
In 4th grade, I stole my uncle's
toupee and glued it on my face...

704
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:47,342
...when I played Moses
in my Hebrew school play.

705
00:52:47,551 --> 00:52:52,389
In 5th grade, I knocked my sister
down the stairs, and I blamed our dog.

706
00:52:53,724 --> 00:52:56,852
Wait, I can't see a thing.
What am I stepping on?

707
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,061
Oh, brother.

708
00:52:58,312 --> 00:53:02,107
Look, a lantern. Somebody must
have been here before us.

709
00:53:02,316 --> 00:53:04,359
- Maybe they're still here.
- I hope not.

710
00:53:04,568 --> 00:53:06,069
Look at these cigarettes.

711
00:53:11,283 --> 00:53:16,121
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down
my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.

712
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,624
If I'd been smart,
he'd still be looking.

713
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:21,001
- Listen to her.
- What's wrong with her?

714
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:23,629
- Andy, it's okay.
- Is she all right?

715
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,429
I should've let him look at my body.
Don't I have a beautiful body?

716
00:53:32,638 --> 00:53:34,181
You've got a great body.

717
00:53:34,389 --> 00:53:38,227
How many years do I have before l
get fat? Before my hair falls out?

718
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:40,354
Before I look like him?

719
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:49,029
Then my mom sent me
to a summer camp for fat kids.

720
00:53:49,238 --> 00:53:52,574
Then, once during lunch, I got nuts
and I pigged out...

721
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:54,117
...and they kicked me out!

722
00:53:57,871 --> 00:54:00,332
- Look at him.
- Don't touch it, guys.

723
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,962
This is one of your tricks,
right, One-Eyed Willy?

724
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:11,635
You must be really hiding something
to go through all this trouble.

725
00:54:11,885 --> 00:54:15,138
- There's nothing to worry about.
- You don't understand!

726
00:54:15,347 --> 00:54:16,640
Don't be afraid.

727
00:54:19,726 --> 00:54:23,480
He's dead for sure.
I think he's Chester Copperpot.

728
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:25,023
- Chester who?
- Who?

729
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:28,485
Don't you remember from the attic?
The news article?

730
00:54:28,694 --> 00:54:31,196
The last guy to look
for the rich stuff...

731
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:34,366
...he went in,
but he never came back out.

732
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:36,618
That was back in 1935.

733
00:54:36,827 --> 00:54:41,290
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out
and he was an expert, what about us?

734
00:54:41,498 --> 00:54:43,000
How will we get out?

735
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,627
- Don't worry about it. Calm down.
- You sure?

736
00:54:45,836 --> 00:54:48,338
- I'm positive.
- How will we get out?

737
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:50,549
We can't be sure it's him.

738
00:54:50,757 --> 00:54:51,800
I know it's him.

739
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:55,095
I bet his I.D. is in his wallet.
Mouth, get his wallet.

740
00:54:57,681 --> 00:54:59,141
Lou Gehrig?

741
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:02,895
- You get it, Mikey!
- Mikey, get it.

742
00:55:09,026 --> 00:55:11,361
It is Chester Copperpot.

743
00:55:12,446 --> 00:55:14,990
- Oh, God. Come on.
- You see? I told you.

744
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,367
We're gonna get killed too.

745
00:55:17,826 --> 00:55:19,369
Hey, look at this.

746
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:20,913
Candles.

747
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:27,085
- They're gonna kill us. We're dead.
- Where are you going?

748
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:29,796
- I'm setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

749
00:55:30,005 --> 00:55:33,842
That's what I said. I'll set booby
traps in case anyone follows us...

750
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:36,345
...like the Fratellis.
We'll hear them coming.

751
00:55:36,553 --> 00:55:38,222
- Okay, hurry up.
- Good idea.

752
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,682
- Where you going?
- To set booty traps.

753
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:44,645
- You mean booby traps.
- That's what I said. Booby traps!

754
00:55:44,853 --> 00:55:46,730
God, these guys....

755
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:54,613
Guys, look. It looks like a skeleton
of One-Eyed Willy or something.

756
00:55:54,821 --> 00:55:56,740
Give me that. Give me this thing.

757
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,083
Oh, God! There's no way out of here.

758
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,335
No, don't, don't, don't, Brandon.

759
00:56:10,796 --> 00:56:12,714
Hey, guys, now that we've got...

760
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:19,054
Look at this. See what I found?

761
00:56:30,524 --> 00:56:32,150
Guys, freeze. Don't move.

762
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:35,946
Don't move. You guys,
don't move back there! Don't move!

763
00:56:36,154 --> 00:56:37,698
- What?
- Freeze!

764
00:56:41,577 --> 00:56:43,328
Run, you guys, run!

765
00:56:48,959 --> 00:56:50,836
Holy shit!

766
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:17,196
Man, that was close.

767
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:20,199
Wait, listen. Sounds like
somebody's down there.

768
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:30,250
Shut up and listen.

769
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:32,753
- Maybe it's a way out.
- Or the Fratellis.

770
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:36,757
- Or Chunk got the police.
- Or one of Willy's booby traps.

771
00:57:41,553 --> 00:57:44,306
God put that rock there for a purpose.

772
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:47,809
I'm not so sure you should
move it or anything.

773
00:57:49,686 --> 00:57:50,979
Hello?

774
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,068
Bats!

775
00:58:03,367 --> 00:58:04,952
Save me! They're in my hair.

776
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,496
Help! Rabies! Rabies!

777
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:11,291
Rabies! We're gonna get rabies!

778
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:18,382
But the worst thing I ever done,
I mixed up fake puke at home...

779
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:23,178
...and I went to this movie theater,
hid the puke in my jacket...

780
00:58:23,387 --> 00:58:26,014
...climbed up to the balcony...

781
00:58:26,223 --> 00:58:29,101
...and then I made a noise like this...

782
00:58:38,527 --> 00:58:40,946
And then I dumped it over the side...

783
00:58:41,572 --> 00:58:44,283
...on all the people
in the audience. Then...

784
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:46,577
Then this was horrible.

785
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:51,331
All the people started getting sick
and throwing up on each other.

786
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:54,585
I never felt so bad in my entire life.

787
00:58:54,793 --> 00:58:56,461
I'm beginning to like him, Ma.

788
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,171
Hit puree.

789
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,215
No, I'm too young!

790
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:03,677
No! I want to play the violin!

791
00:59:03,886 --> 00:59:06,179
- Not my hand!
- Do I get the truth?

792
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,683
Do I get the truth,
or do you get juiced?

793
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:14,021
- What was that noise?
- Fireplace blew.

794
00:59:14,229 --> 00:59:17,774
The kid's not kidding, Ma.
There's a tunnel down there.

795
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:22,446
Watch your hair!
They're going for the hair!

796
00:59:23,822 --> 00:59:24,948
Watch your veins, Ma!

797
00:59:25,157 --> 00:59:28,994
Hey, Mikey, if you can hear me, run!

798
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:30,370
Run! They're coming after you!

799
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:35,834
Hey, If we keep going this
far down, we'll reach China.

800
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,670
Maybe I can go see
my auntie or something.

801
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:43,050
This could get dangerous, Andy.

802
00:59:43,258 --> 00:59:45,594
- You might want to hold my hand.
- Thank you.

803
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:50,057
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, neat!

804
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:51,975
- That's beautiful.
- Guys, look!

805
00:59:52,184 --> 00:59:54,144
It's a beautiful waterfall!

806
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:24,800
- Wow! It's a giant piggy bank!
- We're rich!

807
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:26,009
We found it!

808
01:00:26,218 --> 01:00:30,013
- Gold and silver all over the place!
- It's gold, we did it!

809
01:00:30,222 --> 01:00:31,431
Hold the lantern.

810
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:34,017
Coins! Rich stuff.

811
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:36,395
What year was the map made?

812
01:00:36,562 --> 01:00:37,563
I don't know.

813
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:41,984
Probably a couple hundred years
before President Lincoln.

814
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:44,444
George Washington.

815
01:00:45,863 --> 01:00:50,075
- Martin Sheen.
- That's President Kennedy, you idiot!

816
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:53,537
Well, same difference! I mean,
he played Kennedy once.

817
01:00:53,745 --> 01:00:56,373
That's smart. I'm glad
you're using your brain.

818
01:00:56,582 --> 01:00:59,877
- At least I have a brain!
- You're so stupid, Mouth.

819
01:01:00,085 --> 01:01:01,670
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

820
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:04,882
Shut up! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

821
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:08,427
This isn't gold. This is
a wishing well. Look.

822
01:01:08,594 --> 01:01:11,513
Hey, it must be the old
Moss Garden wishing well.

823
01:01:11,722 --> 01:01:16,518
I used to believe when you threw
money in, it turned into your wish.

824
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:19,271
- I'll take two of your coins.
- That's not fair.

825
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:24,484
- Wait, wait, wait, you can't do this.
- Why?

826
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:27,029
Because these are
somebody else's wishes.

827
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:29,615
They're somebody else's dreams.

828
01:01:31,408 --> 01:01:33,952
Yeah, but you know what?

829
01:01:34,745 --> 01:01:37,623
This one, this one right here...

830
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:40,459
...this was my dream, my wish.

831
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:44,463
And it didn't come true.
So I'm taking it back.

832
01:01:44,755 --> 01:01:46,757
I'm taking them all back.

833
01:01:49,968 --> 01:01:53,722
Come on, One-Eyed Willy, what does
this have to do with the map?

834
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:56,225
Is this another one of your tricks?

835
01:01:56,558 --> 01:01:59,436
Maybe we should keep him alive
in case he isn't lying.

836
01:01:59,645 --> 01:02:03,148
Good idea, Jake. Put him in
with your brother.

837
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:04,358
Okay, Ma.

838
01:02:05,108 --> 01:02:06,235
Come on, kid.

839
01:02:08,111 --> 01:02:10,405
- You dropped something.
- What's that?

840
01:02:13,242 --> 01:02:15,953
- Holy shit.
- We found it on the map.

841
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:18,330
It has to do with the buried treasure.

842
01:02:18,539 --> 01:02:21,083
Jake, look at the date on it.

843
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:23,377
This is an authentic doubloon.

844
01:02:23,585 --> 01:02:25,212
Give it to me.

845
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,922
I told you so.

846
01:02:27,172 --> 01:02:32,135
See, you guys? You never believed me.
I said there was gonna be buried...

847
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,810
Troy, how far you got with Andy?

848
01:02:40,018 --> 01:02:41,603
All the way, buddy?

849
01:02:42,145 --> 01:02:44,314
You guys are so immature. Grow up.

850
01:02:44,523 --> 01:02:47,150
- Come on, tell us.
- Really.

851
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:50,070
Put it this way:
I didn't make it with her yet.

852
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:52,364
And I stress "yet".

853
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:57,244
What the hell?

854
01:02:57,536 --> 01:03:01,164
- What'd you wish for?
- To make it with Andy.

855
01:03:05,419 --> 01:03:07,379
Hey, who's down there?

856
01:03:08,505 --> 01:03:10,340
Hey, guys, it's Troy!

857
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:13,594
Sounds like Andy.

858
01:03:13,802 --> 01:03:15,137
Andy!

859
01:03:15,888 --> 01:03:16,972
Is that you?

860
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:20,934
Yeah, it's me. We're stuck down here.
Please send down the bucket.

861
01:03:21,143 --> 01:03:24,062
What the hell are you doing
at the bottom of a well?

862
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:29,276
Don't ask stupid questions! We're
stuck! Just send down the bucket!

863
01:03:30,152 --> 01:03:33,447
See, guys? Wishes do come true.

864
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:36,992
All right, my hearties, follow me!

865
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:45,292
Don't worry. I brought you more food.

866
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,628
Why are you locking me in here?

867
01:03:47,836 --> 01:03:50,047
- You're not too tight.
- Yes, it is.

868
01:03:50,255 --> 01:03:52,591
If you get out, I'll break your legs.

869
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,052
What are you doing?

870
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,013
If you sit too close to the TV,
you'll screw up your eye.

871
01:03:59,097 --> 01:04:00,849
Jake, leave him alone!

872
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:08,899
Come on! Let me out.

873
01:04:17,824 --> 01:04:21,787
Hi, sir. My name's Lawrence.

874
01:04:22,037 --> 01:04:24,623
Sometimes people call me Chunk.

875
01:04:35,259 --> 01:04:37,302
Help! Let me out of here!

876
01:04:37,636 --> 01:04:39,137
Who knows what we'll find.

877
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:40,597
Okay, let's go.

878
01:04:40,806 --> 01:04:44,643
Whoa, look at this.
Look how deep it is down there.

879
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:46,019
Jake, you first.

880
01:04:46,228 --> 01:04:47,980
I ain't gonna go first.

881
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:51,316
- Go!
- Can't argue with that, Ma, all right.

882
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:53,360
Troy, throw the bucket down.

883
01:04:54,736 --> 01:04:57,656
Hey, you guys, I'm the smallest.
I want to go first.

884
01:04:57,823 --> 01:05:02,452
Get out! I'm the oldest, so I call
the shots. Andy goes first.

885
01:05:02,661 --> 01:05:04,371
Chester Copperpot.

886
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,498
Chester Copperpot.

887
01:05:06,957 --> 01:05:08,292
Chester Copperpot!

888
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:10,377
Don't you see?

889
01:05:10,919 --> 01:05:15,007
Don't you realize? He was a pro!
He never made it this far.

890
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:18,260
Look how far we've come.
We've got a chance.

891
01:05:18,677 --> 01:05:21,471
Chance at what, Mikey?
Getting killed?

892
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,685
Look, if we keep going, someone's
really gonna get hurt. Maybe dead.

893
01:05:27,019 --> 01:05:28,562
We've got to get the police.

894
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,355
Maybe Chunk got the police.

895
01:05:30,689 --> 01:05:31,773
Maybe Chunk is dead.

896
01:05:31,982 --> 01:05:36,320
Don't say that. Never say that.
Goonies never say "die"!

897
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:41,074
I'm not a Goonie. I want to go home.

898
01:05:43,202 --> 01:05:46,038
I forgot. But still!

899
01:05:46,705 --> 01:05:50,667
Don't you realize?
The next time you see the sky...

900
01:05:51,877 --> 01:05:53,962
...it'll be over another town.

901
01:05:54,922 --> 01:05:57,132
The next time we take a test...

902
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,762
...it'll be in some other school.

903
01:06:03,347 --> 01:06:07,142
Our parents, they want
the best of stuff for us.

904
01:06:08,227 --> 01:06:10,562
Now they got to do
what's right for them.

905
01:06:10,771 --> 01:06:13,732
Because it's their time. Their time!

906
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:15,275
Up there.

907
01:06:16,026 --> 01:06:20,280
Down here it's our time.
It's our time down here.

908
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:25,702
That's all over the second
we ride up Troy's bucket.

909
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:08,704
Andy!

910
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:10,998
You Goonie!

911
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,084
Spread it around.

912
01:07:15,127 --> 01:07:17,713
You try to make your frosting
look rugged.

913
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:19,548
Chocolate.

914
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:24,261
Chocolate.

915
01:07:26,138 --> 01:07:29,141
Want a candy bar?
Look, I got a Baby Ruth.

916
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,601
Sir?

917
01:07:33,145 --> 01:07:37,816
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Baby Ruth.

918
01:07:38,025 --> 01:07:39,568
I'm gonna throw it to you.

919
01:07:49,828 --> 01:07:52,956
I'm sorry, sir!
I tried to give it to you.

920
01:07:53,165 --> 01:07:54,541
Oh, I'm sorry!

921
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:58,629
I'm really sorry.
I'll get you a... I'll get you a...

922
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:23,695
Jeez, mister, you're even hungrier
than I am.

923
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:30,536
Booby traps. It's only booby traps.
Why you being such a sissy?

924
01:08:30,744 --> 01:08:32,162
Freaking kids.

925
01:08:39,545 --> 01:08:42,714
- Kids must've cleaned him out.
- Right before they ate him.

926
01:08:42,923 --> 01:08:43,966
Stupid.

927
01:08:48,387 --> 01:08:50,180
Follow them size fives.

928
01:08:52,891 --> 01:08:54,101
Sloth.

929
01:08:55,769 --> 01:08:56,770
Chunk.

930
01:08:57,729 --> 01:08:59,231
Sloth.

931
01:09:00,774 --> 01:09:01,942
Chunk.

932
01:09:42,316 --> 01:09:46,153
Man, you smell like Phys. Ed.

933
01:09:47,654 --> 01:09:51,033
Mouth, hold this. Translate this.

934
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:54,328
"Copper bones.

935
01:09:55,704 --> 01:09:57,664
Westward foams.

936
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:01,084
Triple stones".

937
01:10:01,293 --> 01:10:03,170
This must be copper bones.

938
01:10:06,715 --> 01:10:08,091
Oh, sorry.

939
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:15,891
Wow. Look at that.

940
01:10:17,184 --> 01:10:19,019
Triple stones!

941
01:10:19,478 --> 01:10:22,940
We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
We're right behind you.

942
01:10:23,148 --> 01:10:25,692
Why couldn't I have had a sister?

943
01:10:25,901 --> 01:10:28,570
A little sister instead
of that?

944
01:10:32,282 --> 01:10:34,743
No, that's too big.
Try the middle one.

945
01:10:34,952 --> 01:10:37,037
- You guys are crazy.
- No, the middle one!

946
01:10:37,663 --> 01:10:40,082
- It fits, Mikey! It fits!
- We got it!

947
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:42,960
- We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
- Which way do we turn?

948
01:10:43,168 --> 01:10:44,753
West. Counterclockwise.

949
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:45,921
Counterclockwise.

950
01:10:46,171 --> 01:10:48,966
Try it, Mikey. Try it. Yeah, yeah!

951
01:10:54,513 --> 01:10:55,973
What the hell is that?

952
01:11:02,354 --> 01:11:04,064
It's gonna fall on us!

953
01:11:07,985 --> 01:11:10,320
It's one of Willy's tricks. Move!

954
01:11:29,464 --> 01:11:31,425
- He's gone.
- Oh, no.

955
01:11:31,633 --> 01:11:33,510
- Truly, truly gone.
- Don't be dead.

956
01:11:35,012 --> 01:11:39,182
Pinchers of Peril. You guys, I've
been saved by my Pinchers of Peril.

957
01:11:39,808 --> 01:11:42,728
He's alive! He's alive!

958
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:50,861
You guys, I'm in another room!

959
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:54,239
Hello, sheriff? I'm at
the Lighthouse Lounge...

960
01:11:54,406 --> 01:11:57,409
...and I want to report,
well, a murder.

961
01:11:57,618 --> 01:12:01,163
Wait a minute. Just hold on here.
Is that you again, Lawrence?

962
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:05,125
Sheriff, look, this time I'm telling
you the truth.

963
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:09,129
I'm locked inside the Fratellis'
basement with this guy.

964
01:12:10,088 --> 01:12:12,466
Rocky Road?

965
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,053
Like the time 50 Iranian terrorists...

966
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:18,639
...took over the Sizzler
steak houses?

967
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:22,351
Sloth, get back here. Hold on.
Sloth, what are you doing?

968
01:12:22,601 --> 01:12:27,231
Like the prank about creatures that
multiply when you throw water on them?

969
01:12:27,648 --> 01:12:32,361
Sloth! Sloth!
Sloth's going into the fireplace!

970
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:35,322
Lawrence?

971
01:12:36,073 --> 01:12:39,535
- No, Sloth, it's just your echo.
- Echo!

972
01:12:39,993 --> 01:12:42,454
No, I'll show you!
Don't go down there!

973
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:45,249
It's all dark down there, Sloth.

974
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,960
It's your echo, Sloth. Echo.

975
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:53,924
I gotta go to the bathroom.

976
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,927
Pee break. Who's got to go?

977
01:12:57,302 --> 01:12:58,303
- Me.
- Me.

978
01:12:58,512 --> 01:12:59,930
- Me.
- Me.

979
01:13:00,472 --> 01:13:01,473
Me.

980
01:13:01,974 --> 01:13:06,311
This is the little boys' room and
that tunnel's the little girls' room.

981
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,771
Let's go.

982
01:13:09,815 --> 01:13:11,608
Brand, where you going?

983
01:13:11,817 --> 01:13:13,402
This is the men's room.

984
01:13:16,697 --> 01:13:19,074
- Where you going?
- The men's room, Mikey.

985
01:13:19,283 --> 01:13:21,451
Yeah, we're going to the men's room.

986
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:35,257
Yeah, Mikey's been through here
all right.

987
01:13:48,187 --> 01:13:50,647
Andy, this is not the time
nor the place.

988
01:13:50,856 --> 01:13:53,692
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

989
01:13:53,901 --> 01:13:55,903
Brand! Brand!

990
01:13:56,361 --> 01:13:58,655
Go see what she's ragging about,
will you?

991
01:14:12,377 --> 01:14:14,504
Brand? Hurry, I'm in here...

992
01:14:14,713 --> 01:14:17,299
...with my eyes closed.

993
01:14:41,365 --> 01:14:44,785
- Wrong way, lover-boy. It's this way.
- Thanks.

994
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:53,001
Okay, you kissed, now tell.

995
01:14:55,045 --> 01:14:56,713
There's something weird.

996
01:14:56,964 --> 01:14:58,632
What? What is it?

997
01:14:59,424 --> 01:15:01,093
Does Brand wear braces?

998
01:15:03,762 --> 01:15:05,722
Why are you laughing?

999
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:08,892
Stef, it was beautiful.

1000
01:15:10,435 --> 01:15:12,437
Next time, kiss him
with your eyes open.

1001
01:15:12,646 --> 01:15:15,691
It's a whole different experience.

1002
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:18,110
Be careful. There's a hole, I think.

1003
01:15:18,318 --> 01:15:20,320
I think Brand was standing in it.

1004
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:25,534
Ma, after we dump the kids, how do we
get out? I ain't left no trail.

1005
01:15:25,742 --> 01:15:28,912
They're right around here.
I can smell their bubble gum.

1006
01:15:29,121 --> 01:15:32,958
Ma, look. Give you three guesses
who left this rope.

1007
01:15:33,584 --> 01:15:34,751
You all right?

1008
01:15:52,144 --> 01:15:54,396
What, are you crazy? They're here!

1009
01:15:54,938 --> 01:15:57,399
They're here? They're here.
They're here!

1010
01:15:58,233 --> 01:16:01,111
Quiet. Right down there.

1011
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,114
This way. This way! This way!

1012
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:06,116
Come on, right through here!

1013
01:16:06,325 --> 01:16:10,954
Let's go, follow me. Data, come on,
don't fall behind. Let's go!

1014
01:16:16,835 --> 01:16:18,128
Come on!

1015
01:16:18,795 --> 01:16:21,256
- Watch your step, Ma.
- Watch your own.

1016
01:16:25,677 --> 01:16:26,678
Oh, God.

1017
01:16:32,517 --> 01:16:33,852
- What is this?
- Keep going.

1018
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:36,855
- Oh, great.
- It looks like a boat mast.

1019
01:16:40,526 --> 01:16:42,903
Jerk alert!

1020
01:16:58,377 --> 01:17:00,170
Somebody's coming.

1021
01:17:01,213 --> 01:17:02,256
You there, Ma?

1022
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:03,674
Hurry up.

1023
01:17:05,259 --> 01:17:08,428
- Data, hurry up!
- Don't be a fool, Data, come on!

1024
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:13,433
- I got a great idea. Slick shoes!
- Slick shoes? Are you crazy?

1025
01:17:19,815 --> 01:17:21,817
Data, come on!

1026
01:17:22,317 --> 01:17:24,736
Good enough. I can see
their flashlight!

1027
01:17:28,156 --> 01:17:34,079
Hi, fellas. Remember me?
We just want to get out of here.

1028
01:17:39,626 --> 01:17:41,420
Stop or I'm gonna shoot!

1029
01:17:47,634 --> 01:17:50,554
- You'll start a cave-in!
- What do you think that was?

1030
01:17:50,721 --> 01:17:53,557
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1031
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:56,560
Hurry up with that flare!
It's pitch-black!

1032
01:18:00,355 --> 01:18:02,524
- Do you have a match?
- No.

1033
01:18:02,733 --> 01:18:04,109
I'll light it on the lamp.

1034
01:18:04,318 --> 01:18:05,944
- Cross now!
- Wait a minute!

1035
01:18:06,153 --> 01:18:08,572
- Don't push, Jake!
- I'm not!

1036
01:18:14,244 --> 01:18:16,330
Sweetheart, are you okay?

1037
01:18:16,747 --> 01:18:18,582
No.

1038
01:18:18,957 --> 01:18:22,961
These are all solid. Look at this.
All solid.

1039
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:24,922
What is that?

1040
01:18:27,925 --> 01:18:28,926
It's disgusting.

1041
01:18:34,681 --> 01:18:35,682
Wow.

1042
01:18:36,475 --> 01:18:37,935
Gnarly.

1043
01:18:38,185 --> 01:18:40,229
That's atrocious, you guys!

1044
01:18:40,437 --> 01:18:42,981
Help him! Help him! Hurry up!

1045
01:18:50,489 --> 01:18:51,532
What are you doing?

1046
01:18:52,115 --> 01:18:55,827
Stop playing around! They're getting
away! What's the matter with you?

1047
01:18:56,662 --> 01:19:00,415
"To move on, play the tune...

1048
01:19:00,749 --> 01:19:02,834
...as each note is said.

1049
01:19:03,418 --> 01:19:07,297
If you make too many mistakes...

1050
01:19:08,465 --> 01:19:12,219
...ye will surely be...

1051
01:19:12,427 --> 01:19:13,929
- Be what?
...muerto".

1052
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,723
- What is that? Come on.
- Dead.

1053
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:18,892
Oh, God!

1054
01:19:21,478 --> 01:19:24,189
We gotta play the bones
to get out of here?

1055
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:25,941
Exactly.

1056
01:19:26,608 --> 01:19:29,027
- They're on the bridge.
- Hurry up!

1057
01:19:29,444 --> 01:19:34,449
- Look! There are notes on this.
- Andy, you took piano lessons.

1058
01:19:34,658 --> 01:19:37,870
- I was 4 years old.
- You want to live to be 17?

1059
01:19:38,078 --> 01:19:39,496
- Hit it!
- What're you doing!

1060
01:19:39,663 --> 01:19:42,666
Finding middle C. This isn't
like my mother's Steinway.

1061
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,960
Do something, hurry!

1062
01:19:45,168 --> 01:19:48,797
This first chord, I think, is....

1063
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:50,841
Go on, Andy!

1064
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:59,057
My God, it's working!
You did it!

1065
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:04,062
- Way to go, Andy! Way to go!
- It's all coming back to me. Okay.

1066
01:20:06,064 --> 01:20:07,107
A.

1067
01:20:08,358 --> 01:20:12,112
- C sharp, D.
- Remember the lessons, play it right!

1068
01:20:35,802 --> 01:20:40,224
They're coming, guys. They're
down there! They're coming out!

1069
01:20:40,474 --> 01:20:43,185
- What should I do?
- All right!

1070
01:20:47,898 --> 01:20:49,024
They're coming.

1071
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:55,364
You guys, they look really pissed off!

1072
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,334
- What were you thinking?
- I hit the wrong note.

1073
01:21:07,543 --> 01:21:11,129
- I'm not Liberace, you know.
- Listen, you're doing fine.

1074
01:21:11,338 --> 01:21:15,133
Andy, I believe in you.
Goonies always make mistakes.

1075
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:17,135
Don't make any more.

1076
01:21:18,303 --> 01:21:19,763
Where was I?

1077
01:21:20,222 --> 01:21:21,765
- A, A flat.
- Play it!

1078
01:21:31,483 --> 01:21:34,069
Hey, you guys, they're gone!
They're not here!

1079
01:21:57,551 --> 01:22:01,805
I can't tell if it's an A sharp
or a B flat.

1080
01:22:02,598 --> 01:22:05,475
If you hit the wrong note,
we'll all be flat.

1081
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:19,740
Oh, my God!

1082
01:22:25,412 --> 01:22:26,705
Go! Go!

1083
01:22:27,289 --> 01:22:28,874
Oh, my God!

1084
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:31,960
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

1085
01:22:32,794 --> 01:22:34,046
Let's go!

1086
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:37,090
- Brand, wait!
- What?

1087
01:22:37,758 --> 01:22:39,301
- What are you doing?
- The map!

1088
01:22:39,551 --> 01:22:40,761
Let's get out of here!

1089
01:22:42,095 --> 01:22:43,055
Damn it!

1090
01:23:30,978 --> 01:23:34,147
Oh, shit!

1091
01:23:35,691 --> 01:23:37,276
Geronimo!

1092
01:23:45,492 --> 01:23:48,537
- Are you okay, Mouth? Andy?
- Are you okay, Stef.

1093
01:23:48,787 --> 01:23:49,788
What?

1094
01:23:51,248 --> 01:23:55,794
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow!

1095
01:24:10,809 --> 01:24:12,102
Oh, my God!

1096
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:14,688
Oh, God!

1097
01:24:15,022 --> 01:24:17,524
- Follow me.
- It's too....

1098
01:24:19,193 --> 01:24:20,402
I can't do it, Mama.

1099
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:26,825
Idiot!

1100
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,332
Hold on, you guys.

1101
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:36,752
The water's really shallow.

1102
01:24:44,301 --> 01:24:45,636
You okay, Data?

1103
01:25:19,086 --> 01:25:21,213
You really think there's a treasure?

1104
01:25:21,421 --> 01:25:23,465
Andy, this whole ship's a treasure.

1105
01:25:25,509 --> 01:25:26,927
Mikey, look!

1106
01:25:29,972 --> 01:25:31,431
Don't worry. It's just a skeleton.

1107
01:25:37,604 --> 01:25:38,897
There's gotta be gold.

1108
01:25:42,651 --> 01:25:44,361
Data. Data's okay.

1109
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:52,870
Data's okay.

1110
01:25:53,078 --> 01:25:57,666
Data's quite tired of falling!
And Data's tired of skeletons!

1111
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,961
- Why didn't you use the stairs?
- Use the stairs!

1112
01:26:01,169 --> 01:26:02,170
Stairs!

1113
01:26:02,921 --> 01:26:06,633
The stupid guys tell me to use
the stairs when Data's falling.

1114
01:26:06,842 --> 01:26:10,387
- If Data's hurt, nobody cares anymore.
- Data's okay.

1115
01:26:12,139 --> 01:26:15,142
Then some guy tells me
I have stupid inventions.

1116
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:18,020
I've been spending
months and months...

1117
01:26:18,228 --> 01:26:20,689
...studying on them
and inventing them. God!

1118
01:26:25,485 --> 01:26:28,071
- Don't touch that.
- Why not? He's dead.

1119
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,949
- Have some respect.
- Put that down.

1120
01:26:31,158 --> 01:26:32,951
How many ships were there?

1121
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:36,788
- Billions.
- Billions? Billions?!

1122
01:26:37,748 --> 01:26:40,918
Watch where you step, all right?
Don't slip. Don't...

1123
01:26:48,508 --> 01:26:50,552
Mouth, translate.

1124
01:26:50,761 --> 01:26:54,806
Translate nothing. It's a sketch
of the cannonball chamber.

1125
01:26:55,015 --> 01:26:56,016
Where's the gold?!

1126
01:26:56,225 --> 01:26:59,728
Where's the gold, Mikey?!
I'm tired of these games!

1127
01:27:05,025 --> 01:27:06,568
I set off another trap.

1128
01:27:09,947 --> 01:27:13,742
Oh, God! I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Are you guys okay?

1129
01:27:14,493 --> 01:27:15,327
Oh, my God!

1130
01:27:15,661 --> 01:27:16,662
It's Willy.

1131
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:20,082
Break through.

1132
01:27:38,267 --> 01:27:40,978
- What's up there?
- It's all right, Brand.

1133
01:27:41,186 --> 01:27:43,272
- Just give me a second.
- Okay.

1134
01:28:17,431 --> 01:28:19,933
I know how these guys must've died.

1135
01:28:28,483 --> 01:28:31,570
It's Willy. One-Eyed Willy.

1136
01:28:41,496 --> 01:28:42,581
Hi, Willy.

1137
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:48,670
I'm Mike Walsh.
You've been expecting me...

1138
01:28:49,504 --> 01:28:50,756
...haven't you?

1139
01:28:51,882 --> 01:28:53,592
I made it. I beat you.

1140
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,262
I got here in one piece so far.

1141
01:29:08,482 --> 01:29:12,277
That's why they call you
One-Eyed Willy, One-Eyed Willy.

1142
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:17,824
We have a lot in common, huh, Willy?

1143
01:29:20,494 --> 01:29:22,204
You know something, Willy?

1144
01:29:23,163 --> 01:29:24,831
You're the first Goonie.

1145
01:29:34,883 --> 01:29:35,884
Hi, guys.

1146
01:29:37,219 --> 01:29:40,389
How's it going? This is Willy.

1147
01:29:40,889 --> 01:29:42,349
One-Eyed Willy.

1148
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:44,351
Say hi, Willy.

1149
01:29:46,103 --> 01:29:49,314
Those are my friends, the Goonies.

1150
01:29:51,525 --> 01:29:53,151
How long have you been there?

1151
01:29:53,902 --> 01:29:56,655
Long enough, Mikey. Long enough.

1152
01:30:19,344 --> 01:30:21,805
What are you staring at?
Let's go, load up!

1153
01:30:22,014 --> 01:30:24,016
Anything that fits in your pockets.

1154
01:30:24,224 --> 01:30:25,559
Except that.

1155
01:30:26,059 --> 01:30:28,770
- Why?
- That's Willy's.

1156
01:30:30,105 --> 01:30:32,232
Save that for Willy. Anything else.

1157
01:30:41,408 --> 01:30:43,202
Bye-bye, marbles.

1158
01:30:44,077 --> 01:30:46,413
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1159
01:30:46,705 --> 01:30:49,082
Hurry up! Those creeps are
still after us.

1160
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:53,212
- That's right! What will we do?
- I don't know. Who cares?

1161
01:30:54,379 --> 01:30:56,381
- I got an idea.
- What is it?

1162
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:58,091
I saw it on The Hardy Boys.

1163
01:30:58,717 --> 01:31:01,386
We leave a trail of jewels
into one cave...

1164
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,096
...and we hide in another.

1165
01:31:03,722 --> 01:31:06,767
When the Fratellis go into that cave,
we make a run for it.

1166
01:31:06,975 --> 01:31:09,228
Now that sounds like a great idea!

1167
01:31:10,604 --> 01:31:13,732
- Outside!
- Okay, this is war!

1168
01:31:13,941 --> 01:31:15,984
- Data, don't do anything!
- No!

1169
01:31:16,193 --> 01:31:17,444
I said, outside!

1170
01:31:17,653 --> 01:31:21,114
- We won't be taken alive, matey!
- What do you mean "we"?

1171
01:31:21,323 --> 01:31:22,491
Get Data!

1172
01:31:22,699 --> 01:31:24,952
It's not funny! She's got a gun!

1173
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,620
Come on, snap to.

1174
01:31:26,828 --> 01:31:29,289
- Oh, I love that.
- Come on!

1175
01:31:35,128 --> 01:31:37,005
Sneaking up on me, huh?

1176
01:31:38,715 --> 01:31:40,968
I know what I'm doing.

1177
01:31:51,812 --> 01:31:52,771
I'm all right.

1178
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,065
Data's just unhappy.

1179
01:31:56,608 --> 01:31:57,985
Pinchers of Power.

1180
01:31:58,151 --> 01:32:01,613
- Get it off me!
- Let me help you, brother.

1181
01:32:07,244 --> 01:32:08,620
- My gun!
- That's it!

1182
01:32:08,829 --> 01:32:12,457
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Let's go!

1183
01:32:19,923 --> 01:32:21,300
Empty your pockets!

1184
01:32:21,508 --> 01:32:24,428
Hurry up, empty your jewels! Come on!

1185
01:32:30,559 --> 01:32:34,313
You're so quiet all of a sudden.
Aren't you called Mouth?

1186
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,155
Oh, my God.

1187
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:46,867
Is that all?

1188
01:32:49,745 --> 01:32:52,456
Oh, my God.

1189
01:32:55,209 --> 01:32:56,501
You gross old witch.

1190
01:32:58,754 --> 01:33:03,091
You want to play pirate?
We'll play pirate. March!

1191
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:06,678
- Keep going, smarty.
- I can't swim with my hands tied.

1192
01:33:06,887 --> 01:33:09,056
We'll play pirates. Walk the plank!

1193
01:33:09,264 --> 01:33:11,016
Get out on that plank.

1194
01:33:11,225 --> 01:33:14,853
- Say goodbye to your little friends.
- Brand!

1195
01:33:20,234 --> 01:33:21,360
Get out of the way.

1196
01:33:24,947 --> 01:33:26,156
Who's next?

1197
01:33:33,247 --> 01:33:35,582
Ow, will you stop pushing me?!

1198
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:39,545
- You're pulling my hair!
- You get that girl away from me.

1199
01:33:39,878 --> 01:33:41,838
Go join your friends, you weasels.

1200
01:33:42,047 --> 01:33:43,882
Hey, you guys!

1201
01:33:50,806 --> 01:33:52,933
Sloth! How'd he get out?

1202
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:56,436
Sloth, save them!
Save them, it's Mouth and Stef!

1203
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:11,743
- Chunk.
- No, it's Captain Chunk.

1204
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:13,412
Give me the sword.

1205
01:34:14,663 --> 01:34:18,417
Captain Chunk says let's get the hell
out of here!

1206
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:39,855
The rope.

1207
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:44,484
Jump rope, Slothy.

1208
01:34:44,693 --> 01:34:48,030
- What do you mean, "jump rope"?
- You know, jump rope.

1209
01:35:11,178 --> 01:35:12,513
We're in deep shit now.

1210
01:35:12,721 --> 01:35:14,264
Oh, shit.

1211
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,312
- Remember we went to the Bronx Zoo?
- Don't start that.

1212
01:35:20,521 --> 01:35:24,483
- They wanted to leave you. I said no.
- We never been to the Bronx Zoo!

1213
01:35:24,691 --> 01:35:29,821
Remember how they bought Francis a
toupee instead of fixing your teeth?

1214
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:33,992
- I don't wear a hairpiece!
- You rotten bastard!

1215
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:48,298
Here, grab on to the rock. Come on.

1216
01:36:06,275 --> 01:36:09,528
- What happened to your braces?
- I don't wear braces.

1217
01:36:11,864 --> 01:36:13,824
Mikey, that little...

1218
01:36:14,783 --> 01:36:16,410
Heave-ho!

1219
01:36:20,372 --> 01:36:22,916
- I won't sing no more.
- Just put us down safely!

1220
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:24,459
I won't sing anymore.

1221
01:36:24,877 --> 01:36:27,629
Hey, you guys!

1222
01:36:31,717 --> 01:36:33,343
Mama.

1223
01:36:34,136 --> 01:36:36,180
Come to Mama, baby. Come on.

1224
01:36:41,685 --> 01:36:42,728
Ma...

1225
01:36:42,936 --> 01:36:45,397
...you've been bad.

1226
01:36:47,274 --> 01:36:49,526
Slothy, I may have been bad.

1227
01:36:49,735 --> 01:36:54,156
I may have kept you chained in
that room. But it was for your good.

1228
01:36:57,326 --> 01:36:59,536
Aw. I used to sing to you.

1229
01:37:02,873 --> 01:37:04,541
When you were a little boy.

1230
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:18,013
Fall!

1231
01:37:19,598 --> 01:37:20,724
Break!

1232
01:37:21,475 --> 01:37:22,518
Fall!

1233
01:37:23,101 --> 01:37:24,436
I only dropped you once.

1234
01:37:25,771 --> 01:37:27,356
Well, maybe twice.

1235
01:37:30,442 --> 01:37:31,777
Put me down.

1236
01:37:40,202 --> 01:37:42,120
- I don't mind dying.
- Calm down.

1237
01:37:42,329 --> 01:37:43,580
- We'll be okay.
- Sure.

1238
01:37:50,546 --> 01:37:54,341
I gotta rot with you through eternity?
I don't want to rot with you!

1239
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:04,226
Sloth, this is the guys.
Guys, this is Sloth.

1240
01:38:05,686 --> 01:38:10,357
Brand, we can't go. We can't leave
all that gold. That's our future.

1241
01:38:10,566 --> 01:38:14,528
If we stay here, we got no future.
We'll come back for it later.

1242
01:38:14,736 --> 01:38:16,822
- All that rich stuff.
- Come on!

1243
01:38:18,198 --> 01:38:19,825
Mama, just let us down easy.

1244
01:38:21,994 --> 01:38:24,288
Not the sword!
Don't do that, we're gonna...

1245
01:38:29,751 --> 01:38:31,086
- You all right?
- Yeah. You?

1246
01:38:31,295 --> 01:38:32,337
Yeah.

1247
01:38:34,089 --> 01:38:35,674
Will you get up?!

1248
01:38:37,217 --> 01:38:38,635
Let's go find the gold.

1249
01:38:39,845 --> 01:38:41,013
Head for the light.

1250
01:38:48,812 --> 01:38:50,898
Thank you, Mr. Willy.

1251
01:38:51,273 --> 01:38:52,733
Thank you.

1252
01:38:53,192 --> 01:38:54,818
You've made my day.

1253
01:38:55,777 --> 01:38:58,322
This is a real treat.

1254
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:04,578
What the hell is this?

1255
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,789
- Another one of those booby traps!
- Booby trap!

1256
01:39:08,749 --> 01:39:09,750
Get out of here!

1257
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,627
What booby traps?

1258
01:39:11,877 --> 01:39:14,254
Booby traps!
Didn't you see the movie?

1259
01:39:14,463 --> 01:39:16,256
Leave it. Let's get out.

1260
01:39:16,548 --> 01:39:18,175
Look, you guys, daylight.

1261
01:39:18,383 --> 01:39:21,470
There's been a cave-in before.
Maybe we can get through.

1262
01:39:21,678 --> 01:39:23,180
I can't see. Got a light?

1263
01:39:23,388 --> 01:39:25,766
I got the last candle. Mikey, get it.

1264
01:39:26,934 --> 01:39:28,769
Is there a way out or what?

1265
01:39:29,228 --> 01:39:31,438
This is a funny candle. It sparkles.

1266
01:39:31,647 --> 01:39:33,982
- It's not a candle, it's dynamite!
- Dynamite!

1267
01:39:59,758 --> 01:40:01,927
Women and children first!

1268
01:40:02,469 --> 01:40:05,013
- You guys, push.
- Push.

1269
01:40:05,222 --> 01:40:06,723
What about the loot?

1270
01:40:06,932 --> 01:40:08,684
What about our lives?

1271
01:40:19,778 --> 01:40:21,738
Can you do it? Come on, hurry.

1272
01:40:23,031 --> 01:40:24,324
Go!

1273
01:40:27,286 --> 01:40:28,412
Hurry up.

1274
01:40:31,415 --> 01:40:33,584
Sloth! Help us!

1275
01:40:43,177 --> 01:40:45,262
Sloth love Chunk!

1276
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:48,015
I love you too. You'll get crushed.

1277
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,685
Sloth, help!

1278
01:40:55,898 --> 01:40:57,816
Come on, Sloth!

1279
01:41:35,729 --> 01:41:38,524
Well, I'll be damned.
It's them goobers.

1280
01:41:39,066 --> 01:41:40,817
They weren't here a minute ago.

1281
01:41:41,026 --> 01:41:44,112
- But they're here now. Call Harvey.
- Yes, sir.

1282
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:46,490
- Here!
- Over here!

1283
01:41:55,374 --> 01:41:56,667
Get the camera.

1284
01:42:02,589 --> 01:42:03,924
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1285
01:42:04,466 --> 01:42:06,468
I guess we're kind of in deep sh...

1286
01:42:10,806 --> 01:42:12,724
Look, you're a mess.

1287
01:42:22,818 --> 01:42:25,863
- Look what we brought you.
- Oh, pizza!

1288
01:42:26,071 --> 01:42:29,116
- Your favorite.
- Everything's on it.

1289
01:42:29,324 --> 01:42:32,744
- We were in the tunnels.
- It's good to hear your voice.

1290
01:42:32,953 --> 01:42:34,705
- I lost my glasses.
- It's okay.

1291
01:42:34,913 --> 01:42:36,206
Can I take piano lessons?

1292
01:42:36,415 --> 01:42:38,709
- You'll get ammonia.
- It's pneumonia, Ma.

1293
01:42:38,917 --> 01:42:40,794
Get these pants off.

1294
01:42:42,379 --> 01:42:43,881
Hold it right there.

1295
01:42:47,092 --> 01:42:48,218
That's great, Dad.

1296
01:42:48,427 --> 01:42:50,137
Just watch this.

1297
01:42:57,102 --> 01:42:58,061
He's just like his dad.

1298
01:43:08,947 --> 01:43:11,909
I just wanted to say thank you...

1299
01:43:12,117 --> 01:43:14,536
...for offering to save
my life and everything.

1300
01:43:14,745 --> 01:43:17,915
- What, what, what?
- I wanted to say thank you.

1301
01:43:18,123 --> 01:43:20,959
Wow. "Thank you". A real moment.

1302
01:43:21,168 --> 01:43:24,796
Your voice is kind of nice when
your mouth isn't screwing it up.

1303
01:43:25,005 --> 01:43:26,423
Yeah, well, thanks.

1304
01:43:26,632 --> 01:43:29,927
And you know, your looks
are kind of pretty...

1305
01:43:30,844 --> 01:43:33,096
...when your face doesn't screw it up.

1306
01:43:33,305 --> 01:43:34,389
I'm just kidding.

1307
01:43:36,475 --> 01:43:37,809
Hey, Mikey.

1308
01:43:39,978 --> 01:43:43,273
You know, you're a great
little kid... Person.

1309
01:43:43,857 --> 01:43:46,401
You keep kissing girls
the way you do...

1310
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:48,695
...the parts of you
that don't work so good...

1311
01:43:48,904 --> 01:43:51,323
...they'll catch up
to the ones that do.

1312
01:44:04,086 --> 01:44:05,963
- What?
- Let her mother worry.

1313
01:44:11,051 --> 01:44:12,594
Oh, who needs it?

1314
01:44:14,012 --> 01:44:14,721
It's the Fratellis!

1315
01:44:16,014 --> 01:44:18,809
- Thank God you're here.
- We need your help.

1316
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:24,606
You're all under arrest. Let's go.

1317
01:44:27,067 --> 01:44:28,068
Don't shoot him!

1318
01:44:29,444 --> 01:44:33,156
- Look out, kid.
- No! Don't shoot him!

1319
01:44:33,365 --> 01:44:37,035
Get them out of here.
You don't know what you're doing.

1320
01:44:37,578 --> 01:44:39,121
These are the bad guys!

1321
01:44:39,329 --> 01:44:40,998
Those are the bad guys!

1322
01:44:42,249 --> 01:44:45,335
Put him down, Sloth.
Put him down. It'll be all right.

1323
01:44:49,506 --> 01:44:50,591
Come on, Mama.

1324
01:44:50,799 --> 01:44:54,094
You have no idea who I am.
You want to lose your job?

1325
01:45:00,559 --> 01:45:02,728
You're gonna live with me now.

1326
01:45:04,521 --> 01:45:06,607
I'm gonna take care of you.

1327
01:45:08,567 --> 01:45:10,235
Because I love you.

1328
01:45:11,069 --> 01:45:14,656
- I love you, Chunk.
- Oh, I love you, Sloth.

1329
01:45:17,034 --> 01:45:19,244
Walsh, today's the day,
so let's get this over with.

1330
01:45:20,204 --> 01:45:21,371
Irving?

1331
01:45:21,914 --> 01:45:25,000
- I'm sorry, Irene.
- Come on, we don't have all day.

1332
01:45:25,542 --> 01:45:28,003
There's 50 houses
to tear down after yours!

1333
01:45:28,545 --> 01:45:30,380
- Ease off, Brand.
- Punk!

1334
01:45:32,007 --> 01:45:34,009
Sheriff, I want you to witness this.

1335
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:36,470
Sorry, Dad.

1336
01:45:36,887 --> 01:45:39,097
We had our hands on the future.

1337
01:45:39,306 --> 01:45:42,059
But we blew it to save our own lives.

1338
01:45:42,226 --> 01:45:43,477
Sorry.

1339
01:45:44,394 --> 01:45:47,940
That's all right. You and Brand
are safe with your mom and me.

1340
01:45:48,732 --> 01:45:51,735
That makes us
the richest people in Astoria.

1341
01:45:55,697 --> 01:45:59,451
You're looking at the richest people
in Astoria. Now sign it.

1342
01:46:09,419 --> 01:46:11,755
I'm sure gonna miss being a Goonie.

1343
01:46:23,225 --> 01:46:24,852
What's she saying, Mouth?

1344
01:46:28,897 --> 01:46:30,649
- No pen.
- No pen?

1345
01:46:30,858 --> 01:46:32,276
No write.

1346
01:46:34,069 --> 01:46:35,445
No sign!

1347
01:46:36,321 --> 01:46:37,865
Don't sign!

1348
01:46:43,912 --> 01:46:46,248
- What's in the bag?
- What is it?

1349
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,637
Dad! It's my marble bag!
The Fratellis forgot to check it.

1350
01:47:00,804 --> 01:47:05,434
I put the jewels in it.
We don't have to leave the Goon Docks!

1351
01:47:05,642 --> 01:47:10,647
There'll be no more signing today
or ever again!

1352
01:47:13,483 --> 01:47:15,861
Are those jewels real?
How'd you find them?

1353
01:47:16,069 --> 01:47:17,613
Were your lives in danger?

1354
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:20,449
- The octopus was scary.
- Octopus?

1355
01:47:20,657 --> 01:47:23,452
- It was dangerous.
- Walking the plank was scariest.

1356
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:24,786
Walking the plank?

1357
01:47:24,995 --> 01:47:28,540
- Then we found the pirate ship.
- That and the pirate's treasure.

1358
01:47:28,749 --> 01:47:31,585
- We were chased by the Fratellis.
- That's enough.

1359
01:47:31,793 --> 01:47:35,172
- Telling more stories, Lawrence?
- No, this time it's for real.

1360
01:47:35,339 --> 01:47:37,299
How do you think we got the gold?

1361
01:47:38,425 --> 01:47:41,011
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

1362
01:47:41,678 --> 01:47:43,847
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.

1363
01:47:53,315 --> 01:47:55,317
Folks, we're at Cauldron Point...

1364
01:47:55,526 --> 01:47:58,487
...and what appears
to be a pirate ship....

1365
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:19,383
Bye, Willy.

1366
01:48:20,926 --> 01:48:22,135
Thanks.
