1
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:04,029
<i>Now hear this!</i>

2
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:07,725
<i>Now hear this!</i>

3
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:10,863
<i>Reveille!</i>

4
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:13,900
<i>I repeat!</i>

5
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,410
<i>Reveille!</i>

6
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:20,445
<i>Attention all hands!</i>

7
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,918
<i>Because another cigarette butt...</i>

8
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:29,516
has <i>been found in the container
of the Captain's palm tree...</i>

9
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,754
<i>there will be no movies again tonight.</i>

10
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,425
<i>That is all.</i>

11
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:39,992
All right, hit the deck!

12
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,035
Rise and shine! Greet the new day!

13
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:45,738
Off your hock and grab your sock!

14
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:50,979
Okay, Chief, you've done your duty.

15
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:53,714
Now get your big fat cat out of here!

16
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:20,869
<i>Now hear this!</i>

17
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,673
<i>Now hear this!</i>

18
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:27,310
'C' and 'E' and 'S' divisions...

19
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:31,880
and <i>all pharmacist mates
will air bedding today.</i>

20
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:33,987
<i>Positively!</i>

21
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,531
Doc, what are you doin' up so early?

22
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:47,831
I heard you were working cargo today,
so I thought I'd get ready.

23
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:53,141
On days when work's to be done, I can
always count on a big turnout at sick hall.

24
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,804
I attract some very rare diseases
on cargo day.

25
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:01,542
That day when they knew you had
five ships to load...

26
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:04,779
I was greeted with six more cases
of "beriberi"...

27
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:07,153
"double beriberi" this time.

28
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,623
So help me, I'm going down
to the ship's library...

29
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,218
and throw that old copy
of Moby <i>Dick</i> overboard.

30
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:15,953
What are you giving them these days
for "double beriberi"?

31
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:17,732
Aspirin, what else?

32
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,092
Something wrong, Doug?

33
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,830
We missed you when you went
on watch last night.

34
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:29,636
I gave young Ensign Pulver another drink
of alcohol in orange juice...

35
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,079
and it inspired him to relate
further amorous feats of his.

36
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:37,783
Did he tell you about the time
he overwhelmed a 45-year-old maiden...

37
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:43,124
by the simple tactic of being the first man
in her life to ask her a direct question?

38
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:49,459
No, but some of the things he related
positively bordered on the supernatural.

39
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:52,964
I don't know what to do
about young Pulver.

40
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,994
Perhaps I should report his record
to the American Medical Association?

41
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:01,134
There is something wrong, isn't there?

42
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,474
I've been up all night, Doc.

43
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,011
What's the matter? What is it?

44
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:12,087
I saw something last night
that just about knocked me out.

45
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:13,917
What happened?

46
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:15,986
I was up on the bridge.

47
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,585
I was just standing there
looking out to sea.

48
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:21,220
I couldn't bear look at
that island anymore.

49
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:26,430
All of a sudden I noticed something, little
black specks crawling across the horizon.

50
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,800
I looked through the glasses
and it was a formation of our ships...

51
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,772
that stretched for miles.

52
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:36,934
Carriers, and battleships and cans.
A whole task force, Doc.

53
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:39,875
Why didn't you break me out?
I've never seen a battleship.

54
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:42,884
They came out and passed
within a half mile of that reef.

55
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,981
Carriers so big
they blacked out half the sky.

56
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:51,858
Battlewagons sliding along, dead quiet.

57
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:55,563
I could see the men on the bridges.

58
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,895
And this is what knocked me out, Doc:

59
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:01,925
Somehow...

60
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,065
I thought I was on those bridges.

61
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,175
I thought I was riding west
across the Pacific.

62
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,447
I watched 'em till they were out of sight.

63
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:17,714
And I was right there on those bridges
all the time.

64
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:21,556
I know how that must have hurt, Doug.

65
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,655
And then I looked down from our bridge
and saw our captain's palm tree.

66
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:30,265
Our trophy for superior achievement!

67
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:34,965
The Admiral John J. Finchley Award
for delivering...

68
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:37,164
more toothpaste than toilet paper...

69
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:41,698
than any other navy cargo ship
in the safe area of the Pacific!

70
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:47,509
- Read this, Doc. See how it sounds.
- What is it?

71
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,814
My application for transfer. I've been
rewriting it since I got off watch.

72
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:52,615
- Another?
- This one's different.

73
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:56,283
I'm trying something new.
A stronger wording. Read it carefully.

74
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:01,595
"From Lieutenant J.G. Douglas Roberts
to Bureau of Naval Personnel.

75
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:03,791
"April 16, 1945.

76
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:06,994
Change of duty request form."

77
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,037
- Boy, this is sheer poetry!
- Go on, Doc.

78
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:14,539
"For two years and four months I've
served on this vessel as cargo officer."

79
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:19,706
"I feel my continued service aboard can
only reduce my usefulness to the Navy..."

80
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:23,048
"and increase disharmony
aboard this ship."

81
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,312
How about that?

82
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,085
"It is therefore urgently requested..."

83
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:31,752
"that I be ordered to combat duty,
preferably aboard a destroyer."

84
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,817
I've got a chance, haven't I?

85
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:36,858
Listen, Doug...

86
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:41,464
You've been sending in a letter
every week for goodness knows how long.

87
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:44,506
Every week, the Captain screams
like a stuck pig...

88
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,734
"disapproves" your
letter and forwards it.

89
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:49,437
That's just my point, Doc.
He does forward it...

90
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:54,743
The captain of a Navy ship is the most
absolute monarch left in this world.

91
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:55,806
I know that.

92
00:08:55,906 --> 00:09:00,082
If he endorsed any letters "approved,"
your orders would come through like that.

93
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,913
But "disapproved," you haven't a prayer.

94
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:06,585
You're stuck on this old bucket. Face it.

95
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,692
It's still a chance, Doc.
It's still a chance.

96
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:15,326
I'm sorry you ever saw that task force.

97
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:21,775
I've got to go down to my hypochondriacs.

98
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:37,183
- Good morning, Mr. Roberts.
- Good morning, Dowdy.

99
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:45,156
It's hotter up here than it is
down in that mess hall.

100
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:52,296
Look at that cruddy island! Smell it!

101
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:56,936
It's so hot it already
smells like a hog pen.

102
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,908
Think we'll get out of here today?

103
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,417
I don't know. There are three LCMs
coming alongside for supplies.

104
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:04,948
Are they getting up yet?

105
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:09,957
Yeah, they're startin' to stumble around
down there, the poor, punch-drunk...

106
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,292
When are you goin' to the Captain again
and ask him to give this crew a liberty?

107
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:20,358
These guys ain't been off this ship
for over a year except on duty.

108
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:23,064
The last time I asked the Captain
was last night.

109
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:25,402
- What'd he say?
- He said "no"!

110
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:30,340
We've gotta get these guys ashore.
They're goin' Asiatic.

111
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:35,178
When you see him again, Mr. Roberts...

112
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:37,343
You know I will, Dowdy.

113
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,086
In the meantime,
have Dolan type that up for me.

114
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:41,950
Your letter? Yes, sir.

115
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,775
<i>Now hear this! Now hear this!</i>

116
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:10,440
<i>Sweepers, man your brooms.</i>

117
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:13,117
<i>Give her a clean sweep-down fore and aft.</i>

118
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:16,547
Sweep down <i>all</i> ladders
and <i>all</i> passageways.

119
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:19,791
<i>Do not throw trash over the fantail.</i>

120
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,435
<i>Now sick call will commence immediately.</i>

121
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,532
Now.

122
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,276
When I woke up this morning...

123
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:41,680
And remembered you were working cargo.

124
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,447
Continue.

125
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,783
Honest, Doc, I couldn't even straighten up.

126
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,787
I guess it's the old appendix again.

127
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:51,786
That appendix of yours
certainly gets around.

128
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:54,190
Now it's on the wrong side.

129
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:57,157
Two aspirin! Mark for duty. Next.

130
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:00,602
Aspirin? For a floating appendix, Doc?

131
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:04,528
Yeah, it's the latest thing.
I'll have one with you. Next!

132
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,445
Well, where do you hurt?

133
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,910
It's my head, Doc. It's my head.

134
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:16,576
Dizzy?

135
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:18,843
It's terrible!

136
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:20,878
Ringing in your ears?

137
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:24,322
- Well, I mean it's all the time, Doc.
- Like bells?

138
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:26,428
That's it, Doc, like bells!

139
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,223
Like that, Doc.

140
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:34,124
How do they go, "dong-dong," "ding-ding,"
or "ding-dong"? It's important.

141
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:40,069
"Ding-dong"? "Dong-ding"?

142
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:42,334
No second guessing. Too bad.

143
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,976
They should go "dong-dong."
One aspirin! Mark for duty.

144
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:50,779
<i>There is now available at the ship's store
a small supply of peanut brittle.</i>

145
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:56,488
<i>The ship's store will be open
from 1300 to 1315.</i>

146
00:12:56,913 --> 00:13:00,190
Insigna, I've got a real
special job for you.

147
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:03,924
You stay right here
and clean these binoculars for the bridge.

148
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,625
Let me work up forward, Chief.

149
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,302
I don't want to be around this crud,
Mannion.

150
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:12,363
- Yeah, Chief, take lnsigna with you.
- Get lost!

151
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:14,538
Cut it out, the both of you!

152
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:18,043
I'm tired of you two bellyachin'!
Now go on and get scrapin'!

153
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:43,371
Which end of these binoculars
do you look through?

154
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,736
I guess it's optional, lnsigna.

155
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:50,070
It depends on what size eyeball you've got.

156
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:57,445
What time would it be in San Francisco?

157
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,283
About midnight last night.

158
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,520
Midnight last night?

159
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,653
The Japs must have took over that island!

160
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,021
There's a red and white flag
on that new building.

161
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:12,658
Japs? We ain't been
within 5,000 miles of any Japs.

162
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:14,860
Japs, you hear that, Wiley?

163
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:16,664
Smart, ain't he?

164
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,806
That's a hospital flag.

165
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,154
They've got a fancy
building on that island.

166
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:37,649
Yeah, they've got big windows and...

167
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:42,456
Holy Cow!

168
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:46,094
Holy Cow! They've got nurses
on that island!

169
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:49,897
That nurse, she's taking a shower!

170
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,738
Look! On the second story.
She's a blonde! See?

171
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:59,245
- Get off my back!
- Knock it off!

172
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:04,017
I've never seen such a beautiful girl!

173
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,850
She sure is taking a long time
in that shower.

174
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:11,792
Yeah, honey...

175
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:16,294
Come on over here by the window!

176
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:20,031
How do you use this thing?

177
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:25,872
There's another one over by the wash basin
taking a shampoo!

178
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,702
She's got a bathrobe on.

179
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:31,811
What a stupid way to take a shampoo,
with a bathrobe on!

180
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:34,439
What's stupid about it?
Do you think she wants to...

181
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:37,048
Please, fellas! Come on!

182
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:39,849
- Didn't I tell you she was beautiful?
- Yeah, man!

183
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,481
I can't even see the island.

184
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:45,223
Well, so long, blondie!

185
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:47,387
There goes the other one!

186
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,822
Imagine that pig not takin' a shower?

187
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:55,661
Come on, girls, who's next?

188
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:59,201
I'm getting it! I'm getting it, yeah!

189
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,409
But there ain't no one in there now.

190
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:03,102
Help', try mine!

191
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:09,812
They must think we got
nothing better to do than stand here.

192
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:11,211
Do you see anything?

193
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,345
No, you've been panting on the lens.

194
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,912
These glasses is gettin' heavy!

195
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:17,424
We're wasting manpower. Let's take turns.

196
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:19,283
I'll take the first watch.

197
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,125
Look!

198
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:30,967
There goes a sea gull.

199
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,648
Look at 'em now, will you!

200
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,217
See anything, Mannion?

201
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:13,462
They're gone.

202
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:14,873
Why, you dirty miserable cheat!

203
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:18,538
It's too bad! There were three
a minute ago. One was about to take...

204
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:20,012
Peepin' Tom.

205
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,131
Knock it off!
Insigna, did you hear me? Knock it off!

206
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:41,931
Wiley, get out of here!

207
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:42,799
Stop it!

208
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:45,305
I'll kill him! Do you hear me?
I'll kill him!

209
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:51,368
All right. Get below, all of you,
and slosh your heads!

210
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:56,480
Hold it right there, Mister!

211
00:18:57,507 --> 00:18:59,953
What's that man doing on deck
without a shirt?

212
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:02,387
I was just speaking to him about that,
Captain.

213
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:06,591
I want that man put on report. I don't
want no one on deck without a shirt.

214
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,954
Is that clearly understood?

215
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:11,464
All right, keep your shirt on.

216
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:14,227
All of you.

217
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:25,071
Last night, down in the compartment,
I stopped three of them fights...

218
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:25,908
worse than that.

219
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:28,142
They've gotta have a liberty, Mr. Roberts.

220
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:30,449
Yeah, they sure do.

221
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:34,013
Call a boat for me. I'm going ashore.

222
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:36,621
- What are you gonna do?
- I just got a new angle.

223
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:37,857
You're not goin' over the Captain's head?

224
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:40,794
No, I'm goin' around his end.
Get the lead out, Dowdy.

225
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:44,425
"If I could be with you
One hour tonight"

226
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:47,462
"if I was free to do
The things I might"

227
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,730
"I'm tellin' you true
I'd be anything but blue"

228
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:54,101
"if I could be with you."

229
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:02,248
Hey, what's new, Doug boy?

230
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:04,648
I'm going to take a launch
over to the island.

231
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:06,419
Over to the island?

232
00:20:06,643 --> 00:20:08,782
Hey, how would you like some company?

233
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:12,725
I'll go get some aspirin for Doc
at the new hospital they're building.

234
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,259
What's the matter?

235
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:20,397
Why, Frank Thurlowe Pulver...

236
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:24,437
you mean to say you'd be willing
to unglue yourself from that sack...

237
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:26,303
to do a favor for someone else?

238
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:29,571
Let's not have any more
of that usual attitude towards Pulver boy!

239
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,804
I said one simple thing...

240
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,574
Okay, Frank, okay. Hurry up.

241
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:45,987
Just in case, Pulver boy. Just in case!

242
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:08,782
See you later, Doug boy.

243
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:48,113
Welcome aboard!

244
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:50,589
My goodness! Attention!

245
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:54,094
This is gonna be all right. You girls
just got in here? Where're you from?

246
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,061
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

247
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,997
How many of you girls are there?

248
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:01,865
Captain, aren't you gonna answer
our salute?

249
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:06,531
Sure, yeah.
If it'll make you feel any happier.

250
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,603
We thought maybe we were
doing it wrong, Captain.

251
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,873
You see, we haven't had much experience.

252
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,446
Well, that's wonderful.

253
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:16,876
Is that your battleship
in the harbor, Captain?

254
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:20,682
Not exactly. No.

255
00:22:22,412 --> 00:22:26,087
Is there anything you want?
I mean, anything in particular?

256
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:30,688
No. Nothing I can think of, in particular.

257
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:35,099
Aspirin! What am I saying?
I've got a requisition right here.

258
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:37,899
All right, right this way.
Get back to work, men.

259
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:39,097
Carry on, men.

260
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:49,111
- I'm actually not captain of that AK.
- No kidding.

261
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:51,246
I'm the Exec.

262
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:55,879
- Certainly must have a lot of "b.f."
- Who me? What do you mean...

263
00:22:56,346 --> 00:23:00,419
Battle fatigue. With all this aspirin.
Seen a lot of action?

264
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:05,194
Well, I sure as heck haven't seen
much action this past year.

265
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:10,393
You mean battle action? Well, I got
a little shrapnel in my left leg.

266
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:12,299
It gives me a twinge now and then.

267
00:23:12,362 --> 00:23:15,172
- I hear that scotch works wonders.
- You like scotch?

268
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:19,613
I was acquiring a taste for it
before they shipped us out.

269
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:21,671
- Here is your aspirin.
- Thanks.

270
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:26,017
Would you like to come out to the ship
this afternoon?

271
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:27,344
Sorry.

272
00:23:27,543 --> 00:23:30,786
It just so happens I have a bottle
of Red Label in my cabin.

273
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:33,459
Have a shore boat at the dock
at 1800 minus ten.

274
00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:36,156
Will I? 1800 minus ten.

275
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,031
- That's ten minutes to six.
- Yeah.

276
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:42,125
I see I caught your interest.

277
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:47,972
I don't want these other girls to hear,
but if you were to come over alone...

278
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,907
this afternoon...

279
00:23:53,202 --> 00:23:54,977
Here's your letter. I typed it up.

280
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:57,916
Just sign your old John Henry here
and I'll take it to the Captain.

281
00:23:57,974 --> 00:24:01,148
Then hold your ears. Mr. Roberts?

282
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:07,124
It's only you, Ensign Pulver.
What are you doing in Mr. Roberts' locker?

283
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:10,994
There was a shoebox in there somewhere.
I can't find it.

284
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:14,834
Somebody stole it, that's all.
There's just nothin' they'll stop at!

285
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:17,164
Broken right into the sanctity
of a man's own locker!

286
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:19,866
Is Mr. Roberts back from the island yet?

287
00:24:20,263 --> 00:24:22,709
As soon as he gets back,
have him sign this baby.

288
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:28,181
What is it? It's the best letter
Mr. Roberts wrote yet.

289
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:32,085
It's gonna blow the old man
right through the overhead!

290
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:34,781
This letter's liable to
get him transferred.

291
00:24:34,844 --> 00:24:37,757
- Let me see that.
- Get a load of this line right here.

292
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,327
"Increase disharmony aboard this ship."

293
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:42,896
Ain't that a kick?

294
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:47,231
I can't wait to jab this baby
in the old man's face.

295
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:50,831
You know how he gets sick
when he gets extra mad at Mr. Roberts.

296
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:55,374
When I deliver this letter,
I'm gonna take along a wastebasket.

297
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,903
Let me know when Mr. Roberts gets back.

298
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:09,176
It was the most vicious fight
you ever saw in your life.

299
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:13,627
Even after Dowdy and I broke up the fight,
I figured I had to do something right away.

300
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:16,491
Frank, has Dolan been in here
with my letter?

301
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:20,500
I don't know, Doug boy.
I just came in here myself.

302
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:23,157
Doug, you don't know anyone
on that island, do you?

303
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:27,265
Yeah, the port director. The guy
who decides where to send this ship next.

304
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,503
A liberty port, for instance.

305
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:33,711
Dowdy tipped me off. He used to drink
a quart of scotch every day of his life.

306
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:36,742
You didn't give that shoebox to that
port director?

307
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:39,184
I did, compliments of the Captain.

308
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:42,383
You've been hoarding a quart of scotch
in a shoebox?

309
00:25:42,678 --> 00:25:45,420
I was gonna break it out
the day I get off this ship.

310
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:47,625
Resurrection day!

311
00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:51,028
You wasted that bottle of scotch
on a man?

312
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:55,859
Will you name me another sex
within 1,000 miles?

313
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:58,166
What's eating you anyway, Frank?

314
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:01,436
Well, look at the fancy pillows!

315
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:05,844
- Somebody expecting company?
- Good Lord!

316
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:12,008
"Toujours I'amour."
"Souvenir of San Diego." "You kid!"

317
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:15,389
"Tonight or never."

318
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:18,686
"Compliments of
the American Harvester Company."

319
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:22,853
"We plow deep while others sleep."

320
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:32,403
Doc, that new hospital hasn't got nurses,
has it?

321
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:34,441
It didn't have yesterday.

322
00:26:34,497 --> 00:26:36,204
It has today.

323
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,371
How did you find out that they were there?

324
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:43,449
It just came to me all of a sudden.

325
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:47,846
I was lying on my bunk here
this morning, thinking.

326
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:51,649
And there wasn't a breath of air.

327
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:55,155
All of a sudden a funny thing happened.
A little breeze came up.

328
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:57,961
I took a big deep breath
and said to myself:

329
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,432
"Pulver boy,
there's women on that island!"

330
00:27:04,193 --> 00:27:08,869
Doc, you know a thing like that could make
a bird dog real self-conscious.

331
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,279
They flew in last night. Knockouts!

332
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:16,340
And one big blonde especially. Of course,
she went for me right away. Naturally.

333
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:19,416
So I started to turn on the
old personality, and I said:

334
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:22,648
"Will nothing make you come out
to the ship with me?"

335
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:26,626
And she said, "Yes, there is
one thing and one thing only:".

336
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:30,195
"A good stiff drink of scotch."

337
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:37,533
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm really sorry.

338
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,238
Your first assignment in a year.

339
00:27:40,296 --> 00:27:43,971
I was gonna bring her right in here.
I had all my old pillows out.

340
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,873
I'd slip her a couple of fast slugs
of scotch and...

341
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,349
Without that scotch she wouldn't...
She just wouldn't, that's all!

342
00:27:57,313 --> 00:28:00,658
Doc, let's make some scotch.

343
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:02,560
Scotch?

344
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:05,098
As naval officers,
we're supposed to be resourceful.

345
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:08,567
Frank here's got a great opportunity.
Let's fix him up.

346
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:11,394
Right.

347
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,774
Frank, where is the rest of that alcohol
we were drinking last night?

348
00:28:21,437 --> 00:28:24,509
- Now, that ain't even the right color.
- Quiet, boy.

349
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:26,945
Color?

350
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:29,789
Coke. You got any?

351
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:34,188
I haven't seen a Coke in four months.
No, it's five months.

352
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:43,593
I forgot I had it.

353
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,271
What shade would you like?

354
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,139
Shade?

355
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:56,045
Pale, smokey?

356
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:58,443
Well, I told her Red Label.

357
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:14,964
- Red Label?
- Red Label.

358
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:18,400
It may look like it,
but it sure won't taste like it.

359
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:24,909
Doc, what does scotch taste like?

360
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:28,581
It tastes like...

361
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:33,416
You know what it's always tasted
a little like to me?

362
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:35,311
Iodine.

363
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:37,956
Of course.

364
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:47,130
One drop of iodine, for taste.

365
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:57,274
Let me try that.

366
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:01,937
This calls for a medical opinion.

367
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:09,215
How about it?

368
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,516
We're on the right track.

369
00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:17,628
Now we need something extra for age.
What have you got there, Doug?

370
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:22,797
Seltzer, some fruit salts, hair tonic...

371
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,132
Hair tonic! That's got a coal tar base.

372
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,577
One drop of hair tonic, for age.

373
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:37,877
That'll age the daylights out of it.

374
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:41,477
That's it!

375
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:57,837
You know, it does taste
a little like scotch.

376
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,344
Do you know, it does.

377
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:13,847
That dumb little blonde will never know
the difference!

378
00:31:13,943 --> 00:31:16,753
All right, Frank,
Doug and I made the scotch...

379
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,250
the nurse is your department.

380
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:22,421
"She won't know the difference
She won't know the difference."

381
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:23,552
Thanks, Doc.

382
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:26,360
"She'll never know the difference."

383
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,766
You won't know the difference,
will you, baby?

384
00:31:29,825 --> 00:31:32,533
No, you won't. No, you won't.

385
00:31:33,362 --> 00:31:34,966
Thank you, Doc. Thanks, Doug.

386
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:38,005
Gee, you guys are wonderful to me.

387
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:40,638
Don't mention it.
I think you almost deserve it.

388
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:44,540
You do really? Or are you just givin' me
the old needle again?

389
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:48,885
What do you really think of me? Honestly.

390
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:56,056
Frank, I like you.

391
00:31:56,952 --> 00:32:00,024
There's no getting around the fact
you're a real likeable guy.

392
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:02,968
- But...
- But what?

393
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:08,373
Well, I also think
you're the most hapless, lazy...

394
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:12,713
disorganized and, in general,
the most lecherous person...

395
00:32:12,768 --> 00:32:14,338
I've ever known in my life.

396
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:16,349
- I am not!
- You're not what?

397
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:17,748
I'm not disorganized.

398
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,049
Have you ever in your life
finished one thing you set out to do?

399
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,021
You sleep 16 hours a day.

400
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:26,224
You pretend you want me to improve your
mind, but you've not finished a book...

401
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,728
I've given you to read.
I finished God's Little Acre.

402
00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:30,024
I didn't give you that.

403
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:33,362
He's been reading God's Little Acre
for over a year now.

404
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:37,432
He's underlined every erotic passage
and added exclamation points.

405
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:42,569
And after a certain pornographic climax
he's inserted the words: "Well written!"

406
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:47,375
You're the laundry and morale officer.
I doubt if you've ever seen the laundry!

407
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:48,881
I was down there last week!

408
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,214
- And you're scared of the Captain.
- I am not!

409
00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:54,684
Then why do you hide in the passageway
every time you see him coming?

410
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:58,655
I am not. I'm scared of myself.
Scared of what I might do to him.

411
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:00,557
What you might do to him!

412
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:03,522
He lies in his sack all day long
and bores me silly...

413
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:06,088
with great moronic plots
against the Captain.

414
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:07,666
He's never carried out one of them.

415
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,034
- I haven't?
- No, Frank, you haven't.

416
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:14,235
Whatever happened to those marbles you
were gonna put in the Captain's overhead...

417
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:17,209
so they'd roll around all night
and keep him awake?

418
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:20,977
Now you've gone too far!

419
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:25,482
Now you've asked for it!

420
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:37,496
What does that look like?

421
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,990
Five marbles.

422
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:44,168
I've got another one in my pocket.

423
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:46,198
Six...

424
00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:48,263
marbles.

425
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,943
I'm looking for marbles all day long!

426
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:03,419
You asked me what I thought of you.
Well, I'll tell you.

427
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,717
The day you finish one thing
you've started to do...

428
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:10,822
the day you actually put those marbles
in the Captain's overhead...

429
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:13,131
then have the guts to knock
on his door and say...

430
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:15,362
"Captain, I put those
marbles there!"...

431
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:18,867
that's the day
I'll have some respect for you.

432
00:34:19,328 --> 00:34:21,808
That's the day I'll look
up to you as a man.

433
00:34:22,865 --> 00:34:23,866
Okay?

434
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:26,835
Okay.

435
00:34:30,305 --> 00:34:32,785
Where's Dolan with my letter?
I'm gonna go find him.

436
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:33,911
Wait a minute, Doug.

437
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:36,252
I wouldn't send a letter like that in
if I were you.

438
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:39,520
You'll get yourself in trouble saying
things like "disharmony aboard this ship."

439
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:45,054
You know, if you did say "disharmony,"
or "harmony" or...

440
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,066
- Where's that letter?
- I don't know.

441
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:49,361
What's the big idea?

442
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:51,905
I just wanted to talk to you
before you signed it.

443
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:55,805
Please don't sign that letter, Doug.
Now, please don't.

444
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:59,045
They'll transfer you.
You'll get your can shot off, boy.

445
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:03,846
Doc, will you tell him what you told me
last night, about how stupid he is?

446
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:09,581
Yes, Doc. Maybe you'd like
to tell me to my face.

447
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
Yes, I would.

448
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,888
You are stupid, Doug, and I can prove it.

449
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,528
You quit medical school
just to get into this thing...

450
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:21,033
when you could be saving lives today.
Why?

451
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:23,762
Has it ever occurred to you
that the guys fighting this war...

452
00:35:23,826 --> 00:35:25,533
might also be saving lives?

453
00:35:25,928 --> 00:35:27,703
Your's and mine, for instance.

454
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:30,107
I'd rather practice that kind of medicine.

455
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:31,768
That's exactly what you're doing!

456
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:32,972
Are you kidding?

457
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:37,814
Look, whether you like it or not,
this sorry old bucket does a necessary job.

458
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:40,647
And you're the guy
who keeps lumbering along.

459
00:35:41,243 --> 00:35:43,621
It could be that right
here on this bucket...

460
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:46,588
you're deeper and more truly
in this war than you'd ever...

461
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:49,629
Doc, in a minute you'll start quoting
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

462
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,588
That is a lousy thing to say.

463
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:53,064
We've got nothing to do with the war.

464
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:56,968
Maybe that's why we're on this ship,
because we're not good enough to fight.

465
00:35:57,192 --> 00:36:00,230
'Cause our glands don't secrete
enough adrenaline or...

466
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:03,673
our great-great-grandmothers
were afraid of the dark or something.

467
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:05,643
What is it you want to be? A hero?

468
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:08,011
Hero? You haven't heard a word I've said!

469
00:36:08,437 --> 00:36:10,417
Look, the war's way out there and I'm here.

470
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,850
I don't want to be here.
I want to be out there.

471
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:15,387
I'm sick and tired of being
a lousy spectator.

472
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:19,486
I just happen to believe in this thing and
I want to feel I'm good enough to be in it.

473
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:22,028
Good enough! Doug, you're good enough.

474
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:24,990
It's just that you haven't the opportunity.

475
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:29,764
That's mostly what makes
physical heroism: Opportunity.

476
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:32,164
It's a reflex.

477
00:36:32,594 --> 00:36:36,542
I think that 75 out of 100 young males
have that reflex.

478
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:41,271
You take any one of them,
say even Frank Thurlowe Pulver here...

479
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:45,084
put him into a B-29 over in Japan
and do you know what you'd have?

480
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,583
No, I don't, Doctor.

481
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:49,521
Pulver, as a Congressional Medal
of Honor winner.

482
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,356
Pulver, who single-handed shot down
23 attacking Zeros.

483
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:59,259
Pulver, who with bare hands held together
the severed wing stretch of his plane...

484
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:05,171
and with bare feet successfully landed his
mortally wounded plane on his home field!

485
00:37:07,596 --> 00:37:08,768
It's reflex.

486
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:11,272
Like the knee jerk.

487
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:16,207
Strike the patellar tendon in a human being
and you produce the knee jerk. Look.

488
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:23,955
What's the matter, Doc?

489
00:37:25,814 --> 00:37:29,284
Nothing. But stay out of B-29s,
Frank, my boy.

490
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:32,699
You've made your point very vividly, Doc...

491
00:37:33,188 --> 00:37:35,464
but I still want to get in this thing.

492
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:38,734
I'm gonna keep on sending in
these letters until I do.

493
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:43,341
- Yes, I know you are, Doug.
- I haven't got much time.

494
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:48,879
That task force I saw was on its way
to start our last big push in the Pacific.

495
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:51,413
I'm gonna catch it.

496
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:54,043
<i>LCM's coming alongside.</i>

497
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:58,116
<i>Will Mr. Roberts report
topside immediately?</i>

498
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,821
<i>Mr. Roberts! Topside!</i>

499
00:38:03,385 --> 00:38:06,594
Doc, what are you gonna give Doug
for his birthday?

500
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,195
I hadn't thought of giving him anything.

501
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:13,502
I'm gonna show him that he's got
old Pulver figured out all wrong!

502
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:16,373
What does that look like to you?

503
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,180
Just what it is. The cardboard center
of a roll of toilet paper.

504
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:23,739
- I suppose it doesn't look like a firecracker?
- No, it doesn't.

505
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:26,181
And I suppose that doesn't
look like a fuse?

506
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,220
It looks like a piece of string.

507
00:38:28,277 --> 00:38:30,553
You just wait until old Pulver
gets through with it!

508
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:34,355
I'm gonna get me some black powder
from that gunner's mate and...

509
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:37,659
No! This is not gonna be
any peanut of a firecracker.

510
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:42,059
I'll pack that thing solid with that stuff
they use to blow up bridges:

511
00:38:42,758 --> 00:38:44,362
Fulminate of mercury!

512
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:46,335
Boy, on the night of Doug's birthday...

513
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:50,002
I'm gonna throw that
under the old man's bunk and bam!

514
00:38:57,272 --> 00:39:00,617
Captain, it's me! It is I, Ensign Pulver!

515
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:04,556
I just threw the firecracker
under your stinking bunk!

516
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:16,694
The Captain wants you to hang on
to whatever fresh fruit you have left.

517
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:18,396
He wants it for his own mess.

518
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:22,873
Better get braced for a storm, Mr. Roberts.
Dolan took in your letter a while back.

519
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:25,434
Stand by bow line, ready to cast off!

520
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,570
You fellas squared away?

521
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:29,877
Thanks, Lieutenant. You wouldn't want
to swap movies, would you?

522
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:33,545
- Sure, what you got?
- Hoot Gibson in The Sheriff's Daughter.

523
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:35,513
Shove off.

524
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:40,119
<i>LCM-Z, come alongside.</i>

525
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:43,356
Hey, Chief! Copper just passed out.

526
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:45,390
Get him up here!

527
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:48,427
Give him to me.

528
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:54,472
Easy boy, easy.

529
00:39:56,832 --> 00:40:00,609
It's murder down there, Mr. Roberts.
Can't we take our shirts off?

530
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,513
Sure, take them off.

531
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:10,956
Kennedy, give Mannion a hand.
Get him back to Sick Bay.

532
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:14,685
Go on, take your shirts off.

533
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,195
Thank you, sir.

534
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:25,928
The boat, watch it!
Dowdy, get a defender over.

535
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:28,402
The Captain wants to see you
on the bridge.

536
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:29,533
Tell him I'm busy.

537
00:40:29,598 --> 00:40:31,976
Slammer, give him a hand on that line!

538
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,974
Watch it!

539
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:43,286
This is what they want.

540
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:46,888
"One ton dry stores, one gross dundries...

541
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:50,157
"20 cartons toothpaste,
1/4 ton frozen food.

542
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:52,824
"Fresh fruit, if available." Scratch that.

543
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:55,163
They've been out two months.

544
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:57,667
- No fresh fruit in two months?
- No, sir.

545
00:40:59,294 --> 00:41:02,605
Give them a couple of crates of oranges,
compliments of the Captain.

546
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,110
Sling ready, sir.

547
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:09,037
Take it away.

548
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,187
All right, Mister!

549
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:18,448
We'll have this out right here and now.

550
00:41:18,814 --> 00:41:21,226
What do you mean telling me
you're too busy?

551
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,919
We were having trouble.

552
00:41:22,984 --> 00:41:25,362
You didn't want me leaving the deck
with a ship coming...

553
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,560
When I tell you I want to see you,
I mean now!

554
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,836
Mister, I mean jump!

555
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:32,636
Understand?

556
00:41:32,694 --> 00:41:34,332
Yes, sir. I'll remember that next time.

557
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:36,000
You'd better remember!

558
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,602
You think you're pretty cute
with this letter...

559
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:43,843
trying to get me in bad with the Admiral.
I'm not, Captain.

560
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:47,114
What do you mean writing
"disharmony aboard this ship"?

561
00:41:47,209 --> 00:41:49,018
Because it's true, Captain.

562
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:54,286
Any disharmony aboard this ship
is my own doing!

563
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,561
That's true, too, Captain.

564
00:41:56,618 --> 00:41:59,360
And it ain't gonna be any letter
that leaves this ship.

565
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:02,893
Any criticism of this ship
stays on this ship!

566
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,838
I've got a good reputation with the Admiral
and I ain't gonna lose it on account of...

567
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:10,240
any letter written
by some smart aleck college officer!

568
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,342
You retype this.

569
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:18,677
Cut out that "disharmony" crack
and I'll send it in.

570
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:23,352
But this is the last one, understand?

571
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:26,355
Every man in the Navy has the right
to send in a request for transfer.

572
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:28,291
No one can change their wording.

573
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,327
That's the Navy regulations.

574
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:34,191
How about that, Dolan?

575
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:36,669
That's what it says in the book, sir.

576
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:39,365
Well, it's a stupid regulation!

577
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:43,065
We wouldn't stand for it
in the Merchant Marine, I tell you.

578
00:42:44,232 --> 00:42:48,578
All right, I'll send this one in.
Just as it is.

579
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:53,342
But "disapproved," like I always do.

580
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:56,821
But there's one thing I
don't have to send...

581
00:42:57,178 --> 00:42:59,317
and that's a letter
that hasn't been written.

582
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:04,057
And, Mister, I'm telling you here and now,
you ain't gonna write any more.

583
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,127
You bring me one more
and you'll regret it the rest of your days.

584
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:12,193
You've got a job right here.

585
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:16,866
And, Mister, you ain't never
gonna get off this ship!

586
00:43:17,632 --> 00:43:20,135
Now get on with your work.

587
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:29,486
Where are your shirts?

588
00:43:31,313 --> 00:43:32,313
Where are your shirts?

589
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:33,883
- Captain...
- Shut up!

590
00:43:34,382 --> 00:43:35,725
Where are your shirts?

591
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:38,926
Get those shirts on and be quick about it!

592
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:42,927
I'm sorry, put your shirts on.

593
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:48,908
Just one minute, Mister!

594
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:53,068
Who's captain of this vessel?

595
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:56,407
That is the rankest piece of
insubordination I ever seen.

596
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:02,881
You've been getting pretty smart lately,
buttering up to Mr. Roberts here.

597
00:44:03,745 --> 00:44:07,818
But this time you have gone too far!
And I'm making you a little promise.

598
00:44:08,483 --> 00:44:10,463
I am never going to forget this.

599
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:13,565
And as a starter, you're on report.

600
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:17,760
Every one of you who appeared on deck
without a shirt, on report!

601
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:20,064
You're not putting these men on report.

602
00:44:20,228 --> 00:44:23,801
- What do you mean I'm not?
- I'm responsible. I gave them permission.

603
00:44:24,566 --> 00:44:26,944
You disobeyed my standing order?

604
00:44:27,702 --> 00:44:30,239
Thanks a million for the fresh fruit,
Lieutenant!

605
00:44:36,411 --> 00:44:37,981
You gave that man oranges?

606
00:44:38,146 --> 00:44:39,682
Yes, sir, I'm afraid I did.

607
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:44,091
Ten days! You just got yourself ten days
in your quarters! Ten days!

608
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:45,856
Do you relieve me here?

609
00:44:46,154 --> 00:44:49,067
You heard me. You get to your cabin
before I make it 20 days!

610
00:44:49,124 --> 00:44:52,537
Another launch alongside, Mr. Roberts.
You want it port or starboard?

611
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:54,505
I've been relieved, Chief.

612
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:56,875
Where do you think you're going?

613
00:44:57,766 --> 00:45:00,508
To my room for ten days. Or was it 20?

614
00:45:00,635 --> 00:45:03,673
I'll tell you when to get to your cabin!
Get back to your job!

615
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:06,309
- Captain, you told me...
- Never mind what I told you.

616
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:07,648
I'm telling you.

617
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:18,427
Who is that officer? You, boy!

618
00:45:22,424 --> 00:45:23,732
Yes, you. Come here.

619
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:39,581
Are you one of my officers?

620
00:45:40,108 --> 00:45:41,109
Yes, sir.

621
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:43,579
What's your name again?

622
00:45:43,778 --> 00:45:45,485
Ensign Pulver, sir.

623
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:55,160
I'm glad to see there's someone aboard
this vessel who knows how to salute.

624
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:04,100
How is it I don't see you around much,
Pulver?

625
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,869
I've often wondered
the same thing myself, sir.

626
00:46:08,303 --> 00:46:09,748
What's your job?

627
00:46:10,105 --> 00:46:12,949
Officer in charge of
laundry and morale, sir.

628
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:16,616
How long have you been aboard?

629
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:24,854
Fourteen months, sir.

630
00:46:25,954 --> 00:46:27,558
Fourteen months!

631
00:46:34,129 --> 00:46:36,302
Spend most of your time
in the laundry?

632
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:38,540
Yes, sir. Most of the time.

633
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:41,811
- You do a very good job.
- Thank you, sir.

634
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,406
- Except for one thing.
- Sir?

635
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:46,112
I don't like starch in my pajamas.

636
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,984
- You'll watch out for that, won't you?
- Yes, sir.

637
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:51,614
Fine. You're doing very good work, Pulver.

638
00:46:53,248 --> 00:46:56,092
You must come to my cabin sometime
and have dinner.

639
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:15,914
Cut it out, Doug. Now knock it off!

640
00:47:16,204 --> 00:47:18,047
Cut it out! He's got his nerve.

641
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:21,582
Wait till next week, Doug,
when he gets his laundry.

642
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,558
Doug, I'm gonna get some starch.
You know, some of that real thick starch...

643
00:47:26,915 --> 00:47:28,952
like they use on nurses' uniforms...

644
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:45,707
And when old Roberts said that, I thought
the Captain was gonna lose his marbles!

645
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:49,574
Nothing stops old Roberts!

646
00:47:59,747 --> 00:48:00,919
<i>Nice gain', Mr. Roberts.</i>

647
00:48:00,982 --> 00:48:04,191
It was really beautiful
the way you read the old man off.

648
00:48:04,419 --> 00:48:06,695
You're gonna send in another one
next week?

649
00:48:06,754 --> 00:48:11,066
He sure is! And it's my turn to shove it
right under the old man's nose.

650
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:14,068
Yeah, but you've got a promotion
coming up, haven't you?

651
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:15,607
But could he stop that?

652
00:48:15,864 --> 00:48:17,241
Promotion? This is Mr. Roberts!

653
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:20,245
You think he gives a good hoot
about another lousy stripe?

654
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:24,377
We've gotta write a real hot one
next week, Mr. Roberts?

655
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:26,248
We'll use asbestos paper.

656
00:48:29,777 --> 00:48:32,883
He'll fix the old man's clock. You wait!

657
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,693
<i>All</i> men who have not been <i>put</i> on report
for three weeks...

658
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:47,631
can <i>now go swimming for ten minutes.
That is all.</i>

659
00:49:04,445 --> 00:49:05,719
How do I look?

660
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:08,861
You don't mind me borrowing
your binoculars, do you?

661
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:11,261
It's okay, Frank.
Won't they get in your way?

662
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:14,326
<i>Now hear this!</i>

663
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:19,233
<i>Now hear this!
Station launch coming alongside...</i>

664
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:22,731
She's here! Now you guys
stay away from that cabin.

665
00:49:29,304 --> 00:49:31,807
Last one in is an ensign!

666
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:55,440
Your permission to come aboard, sir?
Where's the skipper?

667
00:49:55,997 --> 00:49:57,806
Never mind, I'll find him.

668
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:02,805
- Request permission to come aboard, sir.
- Permission granted.

669
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,349
Hop aboard.

670
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:10,082
- Request permission to come aboard, sir.
- Permission granted.

671
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:13,586
Request permission to come aboard, sir.

672
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,896
Request permission to come aboard, sir.

673
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,725
Request permission to come aboard, sir.

674
00:50:22,757 --> 00:50:25,294
Request permission to come aboard, sir.

675
00:50:26,861 --> 00:50:27,931
Well, that's all.

676
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:31,666
Cobinna had to wash her hair
but she'd just love to come another time.

677
00:50:40,441 --> 00:50:42,219
How would you girls like to look
around the ship...

678
00:50:42,243 --> 00:50:44,519
while the Lieutenant and I
discuss a little business?

679
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,991
Men, the nurses!

680
00:50:50,018 --> 00:50:52,055
I wouldn't think of leaving them
unprotected!

681
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,930
Right this way. Pardon me. Right up here.

682
00:51:00,028 --> 00:51:01,632
That's it. There we are, right here.

683
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:05,007
- This is Doc. Girls, Mr. Roberts.
- Hi!

684
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:09,210
Ensign Pulver is executive officer.
What's your job?

685
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:14,276
Laundry and morale officer.
Glad to have you aboard.

686
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:16,982
Are you laundry and morale? So am I!

687
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:21,520
Why don't you just take the girls
off somewhere and tell them all about it?

688
00:51:21,649 --> 00:51:25,654
Gee, I wish I could. But I've gotta
clean up. I did a lot of laundry today.

689
00:51:26,287 --> 00:51:27,288
Sure.

690
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,699
Maybe Doc will show them Surgery.

691
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:34,166
Doc, yeah.
Girls, this is our surgeon.

692
00:51:35,997 --> 00:51:37,704
You just go right off with Doc.

693
00:51:37,865 --> 00:51:40,846
Don't let the grey hair
and the baggy eyes bother you.

694
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:43,575
He's a very likeable...
He has a great sense of humor.

695
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:49,281
I'd be delighted to take these young ladies
of the medical profession to my Surgery.

696
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:53,715
But unfortunately we haven't had a chance
to clean up since our last enemy action.

697
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:56,324
Come on, let's see the ship!

698
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:12,076
Flemish up the lines out there,
will you, Dowdy?

699
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,546
- What?
- Yeah. New man...

700
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:24,387
More salt, Cookie.
Put some more salt in there.

701
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:27,185
Now, girls, up here is where we have the...

702
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,893
Follow me right up here, girls.

703
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,508
Now, girls, this is the...
That's a gun.

704
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:46,576
- Imagine.
- Is this the poop deck?

705
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,908
You boys must be the lookouts?
Could I borrow these?

706
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,280
Sorry, sir. It's top secret.

707
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:54,783
Captain's orders, Miss. You know, bifocals.

708
00:52:55,776 --> 00:52:58,950
- I can make an exception in your case.
- Thank you.

709
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:02,119
Look at the fish jumping over there!

710
00:53:02,183 --> 00:53:03,184
It's a whale!

711
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:05,253
- A real interesting cloud formation!
- Where?

712
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:07,799
You can see your hospital
right from over the rail here.

713
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,892
Ensign Pulver!

714
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:18,265
Hey, I can!
Why, you can almost reach out and...

715
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,240
Glasses.

716
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:40,190
Well, you certainly can see Cobinna!

717
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:47,868
We've gotta get back and hang
those window curtains right away!

718
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:50,301
Ten hut!

719
00:53:51,632 --> 00:53:52,872
Right, haste!

720
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:55,642
Forward, march!

721
00:54:03,411 --> 00:54:05,084
So long, harmless.

722
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:13,798
I was just getting the hang of this thing!

723
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:16,395
Now we've got nothing to look forward to!

724
00:54:16,457 --> 00:54:18,596
Just that same cruddy island!

725
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:20,673
You gotta rub it in?
Why don't you shut up?

726
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:21,830
You gonna make me?

727
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:24,706
- How'd you find out?
- We seen them taking a bath.

728
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:28,406
Through this glass, Mr. Roberts,
we could see all of them.

729
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:32,209
You heard what she said.
They're gonna hang some curtains.

730
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:36,248
Them nurses was pretty to look at!

731
00:54:36,911 --> 00:54:40,154
They've got a ten minute boat ride.
You've still got ten minutes.

732
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:44,094
Yeah, but it wouldn't be any fun
when you know you're gonna be rushed.

733
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:47,724
This is the first real good day
this bucket's ever had.

734
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:49,865
It's all over now.

735
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:53,531
Maybe you've got time now
to listen to a little piece of news.

736
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:59,105
"When in all respects ready for sea,
on or about 1600 today..."

737
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,873
"the AK-601 will proceed at ten knots
to Elysium Island..."

738
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:09,182
"arriving there in seven days, reporting
to the port director for cargo assignment."

739
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:15,785
"During its stay in Elysium
the ship will make maximum use..."

740
00:55:16,484 --> 00:55:20,057
"of the recreational
facilities of this port."

741
00:55:21,188 --> 00:55:22,360
That means liberty!

742
00:55:22,423 --> 00:55:25,370
- That don't mean liberty?
- That's exactly what it means.

743
00:55:25,426 --> 00:55:28,134
Somebody must have been drunk
to send us to a liberty port.

744
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:30,402
- The old man seen them orders?
- Saw them before I did.

745
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:32,466
Elysium, where is that?

746
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,407
"Elysium is the largest
of the Limbo Islands."

747
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:39,246
"It's often referred to
as the Polynesian paradise."

748
00:55:40,474 --> 00:55:45,014
"Vanilla, sugar, cocoa, coffee, phosphates
and rum are the chief exports."

749
00:55:45,246 --> 00:55:47,123
Rum! Did you hear that?

750
00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:51,096
"Elysium City, its capital,
is a beautiful metropolis..."

751
00:55:51,152 --> 00:55:55,999
"of palm-lined boulevards, handsome public
buildings and colorful stucco homes."

752
00:55:57,224 --> 00:56:01,673
"Since 1900, its population has remained
remarkably constant at about 30,000."

753
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:03,709
Wait till we get there!

754
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:06,074
Go on, Mr. Roberts, go on.

755
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:12,674
"Elysium harbor, offering excellent
anchorage and docking facilities..."

756
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:18,055
"is surrounded on three sides
by beautiful, green, cloud-covered hills."

757
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:22,958
"The natives are noted
for their congeniality and hospitality."

758
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,339
Nice port, Mr. Roberts?

759
00:57:16,404 --> 00:57:18,577
We finally made it, Mr. Roberts!

760
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,752
You! On deck. Off.

761
00:57:56,477 --> 00:57:59,651
Get them cannibals off this vessel!
Get them off!

762
00:58:33,147 --> 00:58:36,219
Chief, will you tie this?
It's been so long, I sort of forgot.

763
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:39,297
What are you gonna do
when you get ashore?

764
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:43,358
Kid will probably go to the first saloon.
Ice cream saloon, Booksie?

765
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:45,268
I haven't thought much about it.

766
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:48,637
I've got my camera Ma sent me.
I guess I'll just wander around.

767
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,149
Hey, Lindstrom!

768
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:07,017
I've got good news for you.
You can take off them liberty whites.

769
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:09,988
I ain't got the duty tonight!

770
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,826
That's right. You and Mr. Roberts
got the duty tonight.

771
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:14,298
<i>Now hear this!</i>

772
00:59:14,655 --> 00:59:17,067
Here we go! Here we go!

773
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:21,230
This is the Captain speaking.

774
00:59:21,729 --> 00:59:25,267
I just found out that there's
men on this vessel expecting liberty.

775
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:30,347
<i>I don't know how this rumor got around,
but I'd like to clear it up right now.</i>

776
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:33,579
<i>On account of cargo requirements
and security conditions...</i>

777
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:36,121
<i>which have just come
to my personal attention...</i>

778
00:59:36,176 --> 00:59:39,419
<i>there will be no liberty
while in this here port!</i>

779
00:59:41,282 --> 00:59:42,386
That is all.

780
00:59:57,498 --> 01:00:00,342
Come in, Mr. Roberts.

781
01:00:02,536 --> 01:00:04,914
Twenty-eight seconds! Pretty good time.

782
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:08,385
You see, I've been expecting you.

783
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:10,685
Okay, when does this crew get liberty?

784
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:13,682
In the first place,
just kindly hold your tongue.

785
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:15,357
I'm still Captain here.

786
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:18,525
- When are you gonna let this crew ashore?
- I'm not.

787
01:00:19,086 --> 01:00:21,464
It was not my idea
coming to this liberty port.

788
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:25,436
It seems one of my officers arranged it
with a certain port director.

789
01:00:25,693 --> 01:00:28,799
Gave him a bottle of scotch whiskey,
compliments of the Captain.

790
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:32,337
The port director was kind enough
to send me a thank-you note...

791
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:33,878
along with our order.

792
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:37,044
Sit down, Mr. Roberts.

793
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:44,849
Now I admit I was a little provoked
about not being consulted...

794
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:48,721
then I got to thinking
maybe we ought to come to this port...

795
01:00:48,882 --> 01:00:50,160
so as you and me could have a talk.

796
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:52,494
All right. Take it out on me,
but not the men.

797
01:00:52,553 --> 01:00:55,898
Don't you hear that music?
Don't you know it's tearing the guys apart?

798
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:58,163
They're breakable, Captain! I promise you.

799
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,134
Now you listen to me.

800
01:01:02,596 --> 01:01:04,769
I've got two things I want to show you.

801
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,750
That is the cap of a full commander.

802
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:25,754
I'm going to wear that cap some day,
and you're going to help me.

803
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:30,066
It won't do any harm to tell you
that you helped me win that palm tree...

804
01:01:30,124 --> 01:01:31,364
by working cargo.

805
01:01:32,126 --> 01:01:34,106
Don't let this go to your head.

806
01:01:34,595 --> 01:01:37,474
When Admiral Finchley awarded me
that palm tree, he said:

807
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:41,411
"You've got a good cargo officer.
Keep him at it. You're going places."

808
01:01:42,803 --> 01:01:45,010
And I went right out and bought that hat.

809
01:01:45,072 --> 01:01:48,519
And nobody is gonna stand
between me and that hat!

810
01:01:49,276 --> 01:01:50,812
Certainly not you.

811
01:01:53,313 --> 01:01:55,293
Now last week it was agreed...

812
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:58,561
that there was to be no more
of these "disharmony" letters.

813
01:01:58,585 --> 01:01:59,757
I didn't say that.

814
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:03,368
And what do I find on my desk
this morning? Another one.

815
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:07,765
It says here, "friction between me
and the commanding officer."

816
01:02:10,497 --> 01:02:11,805
That ain't goin' in, Mister.

817
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:13,674
How are you gonna stop it?

818
01:02:15,502 --> 01:02:16,503
I ain't.

819
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:20,409
You are.

820
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:25,781
Just how much do you want this crew
to have a liberty?

821
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,356
Enough to stop this "friction"?

822
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:31,189
Enough to stop writing letters ever?

823
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:34,789
'Cause that's the only way
this crew is going to get ashore...

824
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:37,392
this day or any other day.

825
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:44,176
Now we've had our little chat.

826
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:46,742
What do you say?

827
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:51,015
How did you get in the Navy?

828
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:53,816
How did you get on our side?

829
01:02:55,209 --> 01:02:59,919
You ignorant, arrogant, ambitious...!
Keeping 62 men in prison...

830
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:02,820
'cause you got a palm tree
for the work they did!

831
01:03:03,016 --> 01:03:06,691
I don't know which I hate worse,
you or that other malignant growth...

832
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,780
How'd you ever get to be
commander of a ship?

833
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:11,632
I realize in war time they have to scrape
the bottom of the barrel...

834
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:12,902
but where'd they ever scrape you up?

835
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:15,770
There's just one thing left for you,
Mister. A general court-martial!

836
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:17,274
Fine, court-martial me!

837
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:21,677
I'm asking for it! If I can't get transferred,
I'll get court-martialed! I'm fed up!

838
01:03:23,036 --> 01:03:24,344
You'll need a witness.

839
01:03:26,273 --> 01:03:29,152
Call your messenger.
I'll say it over again in front of him.

840
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:34,052
Go on, call him. You want me to call him?

841
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,733
You're a smart boy, Roberts.

842
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:50,806
But I know how to take care of smart boys.

843
01:03:51,732 --> 01:03:55,009
I hate your guts, you smart college guys!

844
01:03:55,636 --> 01:04:00,016
I've been seeing your kind around since
I was ten years old, working as a busboy.

845
01:04:00,707 --> 01:04:04,177
"Busboy, it seems my friend
has thrown up on the table."

846
01:04:04,611 --> 01:04:06,716
"Clean up that mess, boy, will you?"

847
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:11,119
And then when I went to sea as a steward,
people poking at you with umbrellas.

848
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:15,995
"Boy! You, boy!
Careful with that luggage, boy!"

849
01:04:16,723 --> 01:04:19,397
And I took it. I took it for years!

850
01:04:20,561 --> 01:04:22,541
But I don't have to take it anymore.

851
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:28,671
There's a war on and I'm Captain of this
vessel. Now you can take it for a change.

852
01:04:29,603 --> 01:04:33,415
The worst I can do to you is
to keep you right here, Mister!

853
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:38,250
And here is where you're going to stay!
Now, get out!

854
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,664
What do you want for liberty, Captain?

855
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:01,969
You are through writing letters ever.

856
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:08,408
Okay.

857
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:10,217
And that's not all.

858
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,585
You're through talking back to me
in front of the crew.

859
01:05:13,647 --> 01:05:15,957
When I give an order, you jump!

860
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:20,857
- Is that all, Captain?
- No.

861
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,962
Anyone know you're in here?

862
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:26,226
No one.

863
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:27,427
Good.

864
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:30,837
Then you're not to go blabbing this around
to anyone ever.

865
01:05:30,898 --> 01:05:32,400
Might not sound so good.

866
01:05:32,866 --> 01:05:35,210
I don't want you to take credit
for getting this...

867
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:37,078
You think I'm doing this for credit?

868
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:39,515
- You think I'd let anyone know?
- I've gotta make sure.

869
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:42,019
- You've got my word, that's all.
- Your word!

870
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,948
You college boys make such a great show
of keeping your word.

871
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:54,423
Now hear this!
This is the Captain speaking.

872
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:57,858
I've got further word
on the subject of liberty.

873
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:02,702
It gives me great pleasure to announce
liberty for the starboard section...

874
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,473
The whole crew, or there's no deal!

875
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,401
I mean it.

876
01:06:12,606 --> 01:06:16,520
Correction. Liberty for the entire crew
will commence immediately.

877
01:06:17,577 --> 01:06:20,148
You don't have to tell them again.
They heard you.

878
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:23,687
Look at those crazy bugs!

879
01:06:25,552 --> 01:06:26,758
Listen to them!

880
01:07:01,888 --> 01:07:04,198
I've got a bunch of real beauties
for you this time!

881
01:07:04,257 --> 01:07:05,827
- Can they walk?
- Walk?

882
01:07:05,959 --> 01:07:07,563
Some of them can't even crawl.

883
01:07:57,544 --> 01:07:59,421
Well, they're peaceful anyhow.

884
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:01,920
All right, lads. Come on, lend a hand.

885
01:08:25,605 --> 01:08:27,084
Hiya, Mr. Roberts!

886
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:30,786
Evening, Mr. Roberts!

887
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,691
- Duty officer, sir.
- That's right.

888
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:40,093
Colonel Middleton presents
his compliments to the Captain, sir...

889
01:08:40,153 --> 01:08:43,532
and wishes him to know that these men
made a shambles...

890
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:45,866
of the Colonel's
testimonial dinner-dance.

891
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:48,737
You men crashed a dance
for Army personnel?

892
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:51,541
Yes, sir.
And they made us feel unwelcome.

893
01:08:52,099 --> 01:08:53,601
The Army started a fight?

894
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:55,476
No, sir, we started it.

895
01:08:55,569 --> 01:08:56,946
And we finished it.

896
01:08:57,904 --> 01:09:01,044
Tell Mr. Roberts how many of you
Army bums is in the hospital.

897
01:09:02,075 --> 01:09:05,887
Thirty-eight soldiers of the U.S. Army
have been hospitalized.

898
01:09:06,646 --> 01:09:10,025
And the Colonel himself has
a very bad bruise on his left shin.

899
01:09:12,352 --> 01:09:13,854
That's not all, Lieutenant.

900
01:09:14,387 --> 01:09:16,697
There were young ladies present,
50 of them...

901
01:09:16,756 --> 01:09:18,929
from the finest families of Elysium.

902
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:20,494
Well, sir...

903
01:09:23,597 --> 01:09:27,306
Two of these young women were
somewhat mauled.

904
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:30,215
One of them actually got a black eye.

905
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:33,211
Six others had their clothes
torn from them.

906
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:35,619
They ran screaming into the night.

907
01:09:35,675 --> 01:09:37,655
They haven't been heard from since.

908
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:40,154
What are you going to do about it?

909
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,587
I'm due to be relieved here in 15 minutes.
I'd be glad to lead a search party.

910
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:49,759
No, sir, the Army will take charge
of that end.

911
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:54,001
Colonel Middleton will want to know
what punishment you'll give these men.

912
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,768
You tell him I'm sure our captain
will think of something.

913
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,605
- But, sir...
- That's all, Sergeant.

914
01:09:58,765 --> 01:10:00,904
- Thank you, sir.
- Good night!

915
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,243
- So long, you guys!
- See you around.

916
01:10:11,178 --> 01:10:13,158
What have you got to say for yourselves?

917
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:14,920
Okay if we go ashore again?

918
01:10:15,482 --> 01:10:17,018
What do you say, Doc?

919
01:10:20,654 --> 01:10:22,861
- Anybody got a fractured skull?
- No!

920
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:26,465
They pass the physical.

921
01:10:27,093 --> 01:10:29,266
Go and take a shower
and get into some clothes.

922
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:31,639
We've just got time to get back
to the dance!

923
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:36,704
Hey, Mr. Roberts! I'm drunk as a goat!

924
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:39,712
Show him how drunk I am!

925
01:10:40,707 --> 01:10:44,951
Mr. Roberts, when I first saw her
she was eating.

926
01:10:45,912 --> 01:10:49,917
And you know,
she just ate her way into my heart.

927
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:55,232
She was eating a little old palm tree!

928
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:58,333
There you are, kid! Chow!

929
01:10:59,526 --> 01:11:01,369
Wait a minute!

930
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:03,635
What's her name?

931
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:07,635
- I don't know, sir.
- She's got a nameplate.

932
01:11:08,568 --> 01:11:09,808
Her name is...

933
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:14,043
"Property of."

934
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:16,053
What's her last name?

935
01:11:17,677 --> 01:11:18,951
Her last name?

936
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,982
"Rear Admiral Wentworth."

937
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:25,426
Okay, hit the sack. I'll take care of her.

938
01:11:25,585 --> 01:11:29,362
Okay, Mr. Roberts.
See that she gets a good square meal!

939
01:11:31,925 --> 01:11:32,960
Come on, baby.

940
01:11:34,327 --> 01:11:36,329
Hey, Kennedy, where you been?

941
01:11:36,596 --> 01:11:38,735
Okay, you're relieved.

942
01:11:39,232 --> 01:11:41,269
Request permission to go ashore, sir.

943
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:49,420
Did one of your men turn up with a...

944
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,248
There she is!

945
01:11:52,579 --> 01:11:54,786
Thanks. Come on. Come on.

946
01:11:54,848 --> 01:11:57,124
Your papa's over there worried about you.

947
01:11:58,518 --> 01:12:00,759
Say, Mr. Roberts, where's your relief?

948
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,663
He'll be along any minute now.

949
01:12:03,556 --> 01:12:04,967
Any minute now.

950
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:07,369
What are you looking so cocky about?

951
01:12:07,427 --> 01:12:08,963
Am I looking cocky?

952
01:12:09,896 --> 01:12:14,208
Maybe it's because for the first time since
I've been on this ship, I'm seeing a crew.

953
01:12:14,734 --> 01:12:16,839
What do you think you were living with
all this time?

954
01:12:16,903 --> 01:12:19,076
With 62 separate guys.

955
01:12:19,372 --> 01:12:22,979
There's a big difference. Now in one night,
these guys are bound together.

956
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:26,583
I think now maybe they're strong enough
to stand...

957
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:30,287
all the miserable, endless days
ahead of us.

958
01:12:31,117 --> 01:12:33,119
I only hope I'm strong enough.

959
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:37,964
Tomorrow you and I are going over there...

960
01:12:38,024 --> 01:12:41,164
to take advantage of the groundwork
that's been laid tonight.

961
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:44,264
You and I are going
to give ourselves a liberty.

962
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,177
Get a load of Pulver.

963
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:55,283
Hello Frank, how was your liberty?

964
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:02,015
"I'm telling you true
I'd be anything but blue"

965
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:04,658
"if I could be with you."

966
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,444
All right, you men know your posts.

967
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:26,746
Officer of the deck?

968
01:13:27,374 --> 01:13:31,254
I hope you don't mind, but I've stationed
my men along your starboard side.

969
01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:36,260
I'm sorry, but this ship is restricted
for the rest of its stay in Elysium.

970
01:13:36,883 --> 01:13:41,662
Your captain is to report to
the island commander at 7:00 this morning.

971
01:13:42,522 --> 01:13:45,128
I recommend that he's there on time.

972
01:13:45,692 --> 01:13:48,172
The Admiral is a pretty tough cookie
when he's mad.

973
01:13:48,928 --> 01:13:50,930
He's madder now then I ever seen him.

974
01:13:51,297 --> 01:13:53,208
What in particular did this?

975
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,247
A little while ago, six
men from your ship...

976
01:13:57,337 --> 01:14:00,250
broke into the home
of the French colonial governor...

977
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:04,854
and started throwing things
through a plate-glass living-room window.

978
01:14:06,112 --> 01:14:08,524
We found some of the things on the lawn.

979
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,459
A large world globe...

980
01:14:12,318 --> 01:14:15,856
a small love seat, a lot of books...

981
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,895
and a bust of Balzac...

982
01:14:20,293 --> 01:14:21,601
the French writer.

983
01:14:22,695 --> 01:14:25,904
We also found an Army
private, first class...

984
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:28,143
who was unconscious at the time.

985
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:31,740
He claims they threw him, too.

986
01:14:32,405 --> 01:14:34,442
- Through the window?
- That's right.

987
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:38,120
It seems he took him
there for a little joke.

988
01:14:38,311 --> 01:14:40,655
He didn't tell him it was
the governor's house.

989
01:14:41,147 --> 01:14:42,626
He told them it was a...

990
01:14:45,084 --> 01:14:47,394
Well, what we call in Alabama...

991
01:14:48,621 --> 01:14:50,601
We call it the same thing in Nebraska.

992
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,438
That's about all, Lieutenant.

993
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:57,939
If it makes you feel any better,
Admiral Wentworth says...

994
01:14:57,997 --> 01:15:02,776
this is the worst ship he's ever seen
in his entire naval career!

995
01:15:04,404 --> 01:15:06,350
- Good night, Lieutenant.
- Night.

996
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:24,125
Schlemmer, are you all right?

997
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,794
Get up here, you idiot!

998
01:15:27,093 --> 01:15:28,572
What are you trying to do?

999
01:15:31,598 --> 01:15:32,598
Get up here!

1000
01:15:33,132 --> 01:15:35,738
I forgot my motorcycle!

1001
01:15:36,069 --> 01:15:37,343
Come back here!

1002
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:57,458
Kicked out! Kicked out!

1003
01:15:57,857 --> 01:16:00,064
The first time I've ever been
kicked out of a port!

1004
01:16:00,126 --> 01:16:01,867
You're going to pay for this!

1005
01:16:02,128 --> 01:16:05,041
Now get the gangway up
and we're going to get out of here.

1006
01:16:13,172 --> 01:16:17,643
Chief, bring in the gangway.
We've been kicked out of port.

1007
01:16:18,811 --> 01:16:21,792
Bookser ain't aboard, sir.
He didn't come back last night.

1008
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:26,689
Get that gangway up, Mister!
And I mean now!

1009
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,420
Yes, sir.

1010
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:49,284
Come on, Booksie! Come on!

1011
01:17:02,589 --> 01:17:04,159
I'm surprised at you!

1012
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:05,826
Yes, sir, so am l.

1013
01:17:06,059 --> 01:17:07,470
Where did you meet her?

1014
01:17:07,527 --> 01:17:09,404
- At a church social.
- All night?

1015
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:14,307
We went for a walk down on the beach.
We sat there and counted the stars.

1016
01:17:15,468 --> 01:17:17,448
Honest, sir, that's all.

1017
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:20,413
- Better get below.
- Yes, sir.

1018
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:47,842
All present and accounted for, sir.

1019
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:52,714
Right here, Mister.

1020
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:01,815
Well, I guess you're mighty proud
of yourselves...

1021
01:18:02,715 --> 01:18:05,025
getting me kicked out of port, that way.

1022
01:18:06,285 --> 01:18:08,959
Well, we are going to erase this blot
from my record...

1023
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:12,333
if we have to work 24 hours a day!

1024
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,171
Right, Mr. Roberts?

1025
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:17,099
Yes, sir.

1026
01:18:18,331 --> 01:18:21,938
We are going to move more cargo
than we ever moved before.

1027
01:18:23,736 --> 01:18:26,273
- Right, Mr. Roberts?
- Yes, sir.

1028
01:18:27,473 --> 01:18:29,350
Mr. Roberts is going to see to it...

1029
01:18:29,676 --> 01:18:32,850
that you men tow the line at all times.

1030
01:18:34,981 --> 01:18:36,289
That's right, too...

1031
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:39,290
isn't it, Mister?

1032
01:18:40,153 --> 01:18:41,257
That's right, sir.

1033
01:18:41,521 --> 01:18:43,228
You know as well as I do...

1034
01:18:43,856 --> 01:18:46,837
that Mr. Roberts is a man
who keeps his word.

1035
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:50,901
And, Roberts, you do a good job...

1036
01:18:51,531 --> 01:18:54,410
and one of these days there may be
a promotion in it for you.

1037
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:56,344
An extra little bar on that collar.

1038
01:18:57,336 --> 01:18:59,816
That'd be all right, wouldn't it, Mister?

1039
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:04,154
Wouldn't that be all right, Roberts?

1040
01:19:06,245 --> 01:19:07,724
Yes, sir, if you say so.

1041
01:19:08,247 --> 01:19:09,920
You just heard me say so!

1042
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:12,451
Take over.

1043
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,824
See they work up a sweat.

1044
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,173
I just gave an order
and I ain't heard no answer!

1045
01:19:25,898 --> 01:19:27,309
I'm waiting.

1046
01:19:29,435 --> 01:19:30,470
Aye, aye, sir.

1047
01:19:30,903 --> 01:19:32,177
That's better.

1048
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:34,575
That's more like it.

1049
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:50,160
Deck division, bring out the chippers
and scrapers and get after that rust.

1050
01:19:51,524 --> 01:19:54,130
Engineering division, air bedding.
Fall out.

1051
01:20:07,507 --> 01:20:09,350
What's he taking all that guff for?

1052
01:20:09,742 --> 01:20:11,551
"Yes, sir." "No, sir."

1053
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:13,289
"Aye, aye, sir."

1054
01:20:13,513 --> 01:20:17,120
Hey, Killer, do you really think
he's bucking for a promotion?

1055
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:20,488
Who, Mr. Roberts?
He's just tired, that's all.

1056
01:20:22,121 --> 01:20:24,294
Yeah, that's right. He's just tired.

1057
01:20:24,957 --> 01:20:27,028
Mr. Roberts, I got something here.

1058
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,398
A little love letter from the
Bureau came in just this morning.

1059
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:33,773
Get a load of this.
"To all ships and stations:".

1060
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,643
"Heightened war offensive has created
urgent need aboard combat ships..."

1061
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,374
"for experienced officers."

1062
01:20:39,472 --> 01:20:43,887
"All commanding officers are directed
to forward with their endorsement..."

1063
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:47,986
"all applications for transfer from
officers with 24 months sea duty."

1064
01:20:48,281 --> 01:20:49,624
You've got 29 months.

1065
01:20:49,715 --> 01:20:52,218
Does that put old stupid
behind the eight ball or don't it?

1066
01:20:52,285 --> 01:20:56,165
Here's your letter, all typed up and ready
to go. Just the old John Hancock.

1067
01:20:56,856 --> 01:20:59,564
Go ahead, Mr. Roberts.
I want to hear him explode.

1068
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,798
Yeah, he'll go right through the overhead!

1069
01:21:02,695 --> 01:21:04,675
I want to look it over first.

1070
01:21:05,097 --> 01:21:07,441
What's to look over?
It's just a standard form...

1071
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,913
I'm not going to stand here and argue!
I told you I want to look it over.

1072
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:13,849
Get back to your typewriter
before I put you on report!

1073
01:21:20,313 --> 01:21:22,793
All right, don't just stand here.

1074
01:21:51,477 --> 01:21:54,356
<i>From the headquarters
of the Allied Command in Europe.</i>

1075
01:21:54,447 --> 01:21:57,360
<i>I</i> repeat,
there <i>is</i> no <i>official</i> announcement yet.

1076
01:21:57,783 --> 01:21:59,854
<i>The report that the war
in Europe has ended...</i>

1077
01:21:59,919 --> 01:22:02,160
<i>has come from only one correspondent.</i>

1078
01:22:02,221 --> 01:22:06,067
<i>It has not been confirmed by other
correspondents or by Allied Headquarters.</i>

1079
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:08,603
<i>But here is one highly intriguing fact:</i>

1080
01:22:09,128 --> 01:22:11,199
<i>That report has not been denied.</i>

1081
01:22:11,764 --> 01:22:13,675
Turn that thing off, will you, Doc?

1082
01:22:16,202 --> 01:22:19,240
Has Doug ever said anything to you
about wanting a promotion?

1083
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:23,744
Of course not. I doubt if he's even
conscious of what rank he is.

1084
01:22:23,876 --> 01:22:27,688
He never thinks about a promotion.
All he ever thinks about is the war news.

1085
01:22:27,947 --> 01:22:31,360
Anybody who says he's bucking
for another stripe is a dirty liar!

1086
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:32,394
Who says he is?

1087
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:36,126
Insigna, Mannion, some of those
other guys. I heard them talking.

1088
01:22:36,555 --> 01:22:39,798
Outside the porthole,
talking loud on purpose so I'd hear them.

1089
01:22:40,626 --> 01:22:42,833
Must've guessed I was lying here
in my sack.

1090
01:22:43,329 --> 01:22:45,172
What's happened to Doug, anyway?

1091
01:22:45,364 --> 01:22:46,604
How would I know?

1092
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:50,170
He's spoken about ten words to me
in as many days.

1093
01:22:50,469 --> 01:22:51,777
I'll find out though.

1094
01:22:52,672 --> 01:22:54,276
He won't talk, Doc.

1095
01:22:54,573 --> 01:22:57,679
I followed him all around the room
this morning while he was shaving.

1096
01:22:57,743 --> 01:22:59,518
I begged him to talk to me.

1097
01:22:59,845 --> 01:23:02,849
I said, "You're a fella who needs a friend,
and here I am."

1098
01:23:03,282 --> 01:23:05,387
"What's all this trouble
between you and the crew?"

1099
01:23:05,451 --> 01:23:07,590
"You tell me and I'll fix it up like that!"

1100
01:23:07,653 --> 01:23:11,601
Then I gave him a lot of good advice.
Things like: "Keep your chin up."

1101
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:12,792
You know what he did?

1102
01:23:12,858 --> 01:23:15,600
He walked right out of this room
just as though I wasn't here.

1103
01:23:15,661 --> 01:23:16,969
And I was here.

1104
01:23:17,763 --> 01:23:20,869
Mr. Roberts is turning out to be
like an officer, ain't he?

1105
01:23:39,051 --> 01:23:42,828
Doug boy, we thought you were up in
the radio shack listening to the war news.

1106
01:23:43,055 --> 01:23:45,262
Don't you want to go out
and get a cup of coffee?

1107
01:23:45,324 --> 01:23:48,635
- Yeah, sure. I'll go with you.
- No, I don't want to. You go ahead.

1108
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:53,473
Will you get out anyway?
I want to talk to Doc.

1109
01:23:53,933 --> 01:23:57,380
All right. I'm goin' for a cup of coffee.
No, I'm not.

1110
01:23:57,436 --> 01:23:59,414
I'm going to the radio shack
and listen to the war news.

1111
01:23:59,438 --> 01:24:01,042
You're not the only one interested.

1112
01:24:01,107 --> 01:24:02,711
See you later, Doc.

1113
01:24:09,849 --> 01:24:11,294
Transfer me, will you?

1114
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:15,126
Transfer me to the hospital
on this next island. You can do it.

1115
01:24:15,388 --> 01:24:18,961
You don't need the Captain's approval.
Just put me ashore for examination.

1116
01:24:19,592 --> 01:24:22,095
Say there's something wrong
with my eyes or my feet or my head.

1117
01:24:22,161 --> 01:24:23,834
You can trump up something.

1118
01:24:26,332 --> 01:24:27,538
What good would that do?

1119
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,605
Plenty. I'd lie around that hospital
for a couple of weeks till the ship sailed.

1120
01:24:32,004 --> 01:24:34,917
I'd be off this ship! Will you do it, Doc?

1121
01:24:41,947 --> 01:24:43,392
What's really the matter?

1122
01:24:47,686 --> 01:24:49,666
I just put Dolan on report.

1123
01:24:51,991 --> 01:24:52,992
On report?

1124
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,795
Why?

1125
01:24:56,562 --> 01:24:59,805
I gave him an order. He didn't carry it out
fast enough to suit me.

1126
01:25:03,069 --> 01:25:04,514
No, that's not true.

1127
01:25:05,671 --> 01:25:06,809
It's the war.

1128
01:25:07,907 --> 01:25:11,719
I heard the news. The war was ending
and I couldn't get to it.

1129
01:25:13,145 --> 01:25:16,957
There's Dolan, giving me guff about
something, and all of a sudden I hated him!

1130
01:25:17,483 --> 01:25:19,156
I hated all of them.

1131
01:25:19,985 --> 01:25:23,558
If they think I'm bucking for a promotion,
that I walk ten feet across the room...

1132
01:25:23,622 --> 01:25:25,067
to get anything from that captain...

1133
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:27,332
I'm through
with the whole ungrateful mob!

1134
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,671
Does this crew owe you something?

1135
01:25:29,762 --> 01:25:31,241
What do you mean by that?

1136
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,200
You talk as if they did.

1137
01:25:38,537 --> 01:25:40,448
That's exactly how I'm talking.

1138
01:25:42,575 --> 01:25:44,885
Doc, that shows you how far gone I am.

1139
01:25:46,278 --> 01:25:48,315
I'm blaming them for something that...

1140
01:25:49,048 --> 01:25:50,527
What? Something what?

1141
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:56,831
Doug, you've made some sort of an
agreement with the Captain, haven't you?

1142
01:25:57,256 --> 01:25:59,293
Agreement? I don't know what you mean.

1143
01:25:59,425 --> 01:26:01,837
Doc, turn on the radio!

1144
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:04,801
<i>This broadcast will bring you
a special newsflash.</i>

1145
01:26:05,064 --> 01:26:08,841
<i>The war is over in Europe!
The war is over in Europe!</i>

1146
01:26:09,268 --> 01:26:12,272
<i>Germany has surrendered unconditionally
to the Allied Armies.</i>

1147
01:26:12,505 --> 01:26:15,577
The surrender was signed
in a schoolhouse in the <i>city of</i> Reims.

1148
01:26:17,109 --> 01:26:20,852
I would remind you that there is still
a minor skirmish here in the Pacific.

1149
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,659
I'll miss that, too.

1150
01:26:23,649 --> 01:26:26,858
But this is the greatest day in the world.
We've got to celebrate.

1151
01:26:27,253 --> 01:26:29,665
- How about it, Frank?
- Yeah, we've gotta celebrate.

1152
01:26:29,722 --> 01:26:32,896
What'll it be? Alcohol and orange juice
or orange juice and alcohol?

1153
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:34,596
Doc, that's not good enough.

1154
01:26:35,427 --> 01:26:38,237
We've gotta think of something
to lift this ship out of the water...

1155
01:26:38,297 --> 01:26:40,243
and turn it around the other way.

1156
01:26:42,568 --> 01:26:44,608
You're gonna blow your lids
when you hear this idea!

1157
01:26:44,637 --> 01:26:46,412
What a sweet idea!

1158
01:26:46,705 --> 01:26:49,311
You said I never finish anything I start.
Boy, you're wrong.

1159
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,548
Tonight I started something
and I'm gonna finish it.

1160
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:53,886
- Wait a minute, what is it?
- A firecracker.

1161
01:26:54,146 --> 01:26:57,923
We're gonna heave a firecracker
under that old man's bunk, and barn!

1162
01:26:59,618 --> 01:27:03,430
Wake up, you unpatriotic old slob!
It's V-E Day!

1163
01:27:03,989 --> 01:27:08,096
Did you ever see such a hand-painted,
hand-packed firecracker in your life?

1164
01:27:08,527 --> 01:27:11,667
It's the most beautiful firecracker
I've ever seen, but will it work?

1165
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:14,040
Sure it will! Well, I think it will.

1166
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:17,204
Haven't you tested it?
It's gotta work, it's just gotta.

1167
01:27:17,269 --> 01:27:20,273
I'll take it to the laundry, my laboratory.
I've got all the makings there.

1168
01:27:20,339 --> 01:27:22,910
If this one works,
I can make another in two minutes.

1169
01:27:23,108 --> 01:27:26,954
We'll wait here. Be sure you've got enough
to make it loud. What about powder?

1170
01:27:27,012 --> 01:27:29,618
Powder? This ain't no popgun.
It's a firecracker.

1171
01:27:29,715 --> 01:27:32,127
I used fulminate of mercury!

1172
01:27:35,754 --> 01:27:39,292
Fulminate of mercury? That stuff's murder.
Do you suppose he means it?

1173
01:27:39,491 --> 01:27:42,734
Of course not! Where would he get
fulminate of mercury?

1174
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:46,005
I don't know. He's pretty resourceful.

1175
01:27:46,899 --> 01:27:49,539
- Well, how about a little drink?
- Right.

1176
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:55,016
Doc, I've been living with a genius.

1177
01:27:56,742 --> 01:28:00,519
This makes everything worthwhile, a whole
year and a half he spent in his bunk.

1178
01:28:01,547 --> 01:28:04,357
How else could you celebrate VE Day?

1179
01:28:05,017 --> 01:28:07,497
A firecracker under the old man's bunk!

1180
01:28:12,157 --> 01:28:14,034
- To better days.
- Right.

1181
01:28:15,461 --> 01:28:19,671
And to a great American,
Frank Thurlowe Pulver...

1182
01:28:20,799 --> 01:28:25,009
soldier, statesman, scientist.

1183
01:28:26,105 --> 01:28:28,016
Friend of the working girl.

1184
01:28:46,258 --> 01:28:47,532
What was that?

1185
01:28:48,327 --> 01:28:52,173
I don't know what it was, Captain,
but I'll try and find out.

1186
01:28:55,567 --> 01:29:00,175
Hey, there! Up on the bridge!
Is there anything wrong up there?

1187
01:29:12,851 --> 01:29:14,660
Help! Help!

1188
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:21,901
This may be pretty bad, Doug.

1189
01:29:33,072 --> 01:29:35,382
Geez, that stuff's terrific!

1190
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:37,847
Are you all right?

1191
01:29:38,043 --> 01:29:40,922
Yeah, I'm great.
You should have been there!

1192
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,182
You're not burned or anything?

1193
01:29:43,248 --> 01:29:47,355
No, but that laundry's kind of beat up.
You know those laundry machines...

1194
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:50,130
are clear on the other side of the room.

1195
01:29:50,189 --> 01:29:54,296
There's a new porthole on the starboard
side. The electric eye went right through.

1196
01:29:54,593 --> 01:29:58,302
I guess a steam line must have busted.
I was up to here in lather!

1197
01:29:59,531 --> 01:30:04,446
Soapsuds were flying all around.
It was absolutely beautiful!

1198
01:30:05,137 --> 01:30:07,515
What was it? Has anybody found out?

1199
01:30:08,674 --> 01:30:13,487
It was the laundry, Captain.
A steam line must have busted.

1200
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:15,383
Any damage?

1201
01:30:15,814 --> 01:30:20,991
We can't get in there.
The passageway is solid soapsuds.

1202
01:30:21,653 --> 01:30:23,792
Well, tell those men to be more careful.

1203
01:30:24,156 --> 01:30:25,863
Aye, aye, sir.

1204
01:30:39,605 --> 01:30:43,348
Frank, our celebration is
just getting started.

1205
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:46,583
The night is young and our duty is clear.

1206
01:30:46,745 --> 01:30:49,521
- What now?
- We're gonna get the rest of your stuff.

1207
01:30:49,581 --> 01:30:52,528
You proved that it worked.
You just hit the wrong target, that's all.

1208
01:30:52,584 --> 01:30:56,191
We're gonna make another firecracker
and put it where it really belongs.

1209
01:30:58,223 --> 01:31:01,602
All of my stuff was down in the laundry.
It all went up.

1210
01:31:03,829 --> 01:31:06,207
I'm sorry, Doug. I'm awful sorry.

1211
01:31:06,698 --> 01:31:08,041
That's okay, Frank.

1212
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,705
- You're not sore at me, are you?
- What for?

1213
01:31:10,769 --> 01:31:13,079
- For spoiling the celebration.
- Of course not.

1214
01:31:14,173 --> 01:31:15,652
It was a good idea, wasn't it?

1215
01:31:15,707 --> 01:31:19,587
It was a great idea. I'm proud of you.
It just didn't work, that's all.

1216
01:31:20,746 --> 01:31:22,123
- Where are you going?
- Out on deck.

1217
01:31:22,147 --> 01:31:23,717
Wait, I'll clean up and come.

1218
01:31:23,782 --> 01:31:27,696
I'm gonna turn in after that.
It's okay, Frank.

1219
01:31:33,525 --> 01:31:36,438
He was happy there for a minute.
Did you hear him laughing?

1220
01:31:40,365 --> 01:31:42,675
Did you find out
what's the matter with him?

1221
01:31:43,602 --> 01:31:45,377
No, he wouldn't tell me.

1222
01:31:46,905 --> 01:31:50,045
But I know one thing he's feeling tonight
and that's panic.

1223
01:31:51,376 --> 01:31:54,789
Tonight he feels his war is dying
before he can get to it.

1224
01:31:59,952 --> 01:32:01,090
I let him down.

1225
01:32:02,955 --> 01:32:05,401
He wanted to celebrate and I let him down.

1226
01:32:05,824 --> 01:32:08,964
<i>We hope that the King and Queen
will come out.</i>

1227
01:32:09,061 --> 01:32:11,667
<i>The crowds are cheering. Listen to them.</i>

1228
01:32:13,866 --> 01:32:17,871
At any second now
we hope to see Their Majesties.

1229
01:32:18,103 --> 01:32:19,810
<i>The color here is tremendous.</i>

1230
01:32:19,872 --> 01:32:23,718
Everywhere rosettes!
Everywhere gay red, white and blue hats!

1231
01:32:23,909 --> 01:32:25,980
What's all that jabberin' on the radio?

1232
01:32:26,078 --> 01:32:28,149
Something about the King and Queen.

1233
01:32:34,453 --> 01:32:37,559
A steam line busted in the laundry.
They're cleaning it up now.

1234
01:32:37,623 --> 01:32:39,398
It ain't even worth going to see.

1235
01:32:41,059 --> 01:32:43,369
Come on, Dolan,
don't let them get you down.

1236
01:32:47,099 --> 01:32:50,012
What was them croquette things
we had for chow tonight?

1237
01:32:57,743 --> 01:32:58,744
Good evening.

1238
01:33:00,412 --> 01:33:03,052
You fellas hear the news?
The war is over in Europe.

1239
01:33:03,415 --> 01:33:04,485
Yes, sir, we heard.

1240
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:07,394
<i>Sure, maybe somebody“ get
on the “ out here now.</i>

1241
01:33:09,555 --> 01:33:10,761
Dolan, l...

1242
01:33:12,591 --> 01:33:17,631
I guess I kind of blew my top.
I'm sorry. I'm taking you off report.

1243
01:33:18,764 --> 01:33:20,141
Whatever you want, sir.

1244
01:33:21,099 --> 01:33:23,136
Well, I guess I'll hit the old sack.

1245
01:33:23,702 --> 01:33:25,079
Yeah, me too.

1246
01:33:25,938 --> 01:33:28,077
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good night.

1247
01:33:29,474 --> 01:33:31,283
I didn't realize how late it was.

1248
01:33:50,796 --> 01:33:52,571
<i>Since I talked to you 35 minutes</i> ago...

1249
01:33:52,631 --> 01:33:55,771
the picture's changed a little bit
here in Times Square...

1250
01:33:56,802 --> 01:33:59,749
<i>Our boys have won this victory today.</i>

1251
01:34:01,373 --> 01:34:03,319
<i>But the rest is up to you.</i>

1252
01:34:04,376 --> 01:34:07,949
<i>You, and you alone must recognize
our enemies...</i>

1253
01:34:09,214 --> 01:34:14,163
<i>the forces of ambition, cruelty,
arrogance and stupidity!</i>

1254
01:34:15,454 --> 01:34:19,402
<i>You must recognize them.
You must destroy them!</i>

1255
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:23,705
<i>You must tear them out
as you would a malignant growth...</i>

1256
01:34:24,529 --> 01:34:27,135
and <i>cast them
from the surface of the Earth!</i>

1257
01:35:55,387 --> 01:35:58,596
Sound the general alarm!
Sound the general alarm!

1258
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:01,862
Sound the general alarm.
Off to the deck!

1259
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,050
What happened? What happened?

1260
01:36:23,482 --> 01:36:24,722
Must be an air raid!

1261
01:36:24,783 --> 01:36:27,559
Submarine! Must be a submarine!

1262
01:36:27,652 --> 01:36:28,596
What happened?

1263
01:36:28,653 --> 01:36:30,496
- Submarine!
- Must be an air raid!

1264
01:36:37,963 --> 01:36:40,910
Secure that life raft!
He didn't say abandon ship!

1265
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,170
All right, now, wait a minute!
Laundry detail report to forward gun!

1266
01:36:46,838 --> 01:36:48,476
I'm coming! Where's the gun?

1267
01:36:48,607 --> 01:36:49,984
- Insigna?
- Yeah.

1268
01:36:50,142 --> 01:36:51,883
Are you supposed to be up there?

1269
01:36:51,943 --> 01:36:53,945
Yeah. We was up here last year.

1270
01:36:54,646 --> 01:36:56,523
Dowdy, where's my battle station?

1271
01:36:56,581 --> 01:36:59,357
I don't know where your battle station is.
Look around!

1272
01:37:00,385 --> 01:37:04,231
Ask a man politely where his battle station
is and he says, "Look around!"

1273
01:37:04,723 --> 01:37:06,703
Engine room manned and ready.

1274
01:37:06,792 --> 01:37:09,170
All battle stations manned and ready.

1275
01:37:09,227 --> 01:37:10,604
All except mine.

1276
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:15,610
All battle stations manned and ready,
Captain.

1277
01:37:34,786 --> 01:37:38,097
All right. Who did it?

1278
01:37:39,791 --> 01:37:41,293
Who did it?

1279
01:37:42,227 --> 01:37:47,540
You are going to stand sweating at those
battle stations until someone confesses!

1280
01:37:48,767 --> 01:37:51,213
<i>It's an insult to the honor of this ship.</i>

1281
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:55,451
<i>The symbol of our cargo record
has been destroyed...</i>

1282
01:37:55,907 --> 01:38:00,481
and I'm going to find out who did it
if it takes all night!

1283
01:38:01,213 --> 01:38:03,887
Symbol of our cargo record. What's that?

1284
01:38:04,015 --> 01:38:05,460
I don't know.

1285
01:38:17,963 --> 01:38:20,466
Stefanowski, find some battle station.

1286
01:38:25,871 --> 01:38:28,545
- The palm tree's gone.
- Hey, come on, come on!

1287
01:38:28,607 --> 01:38:31,850
- The palm tree. The palm tree's gone.
- The palm tree's gone.

1288
01:38:34,713 --> 01:38:36,351
Read me that master list.

1289
01:38:38,984 --> 01:38:40,019
Abernathy.

1290
01:38:40,218 --> 01:38:41,458
No, not Abernathy.

1291
01:38:41,519 --> 01:38:42,657
- Baker.
- No.

1292
01:39:02,941 --> 01:39:04,852
- O'Neill.
- No, not O'Neill.

1293
01:39:05,477 --> 01:39:06,512
Pulver.

1294
01:39:11,416 --> 01:39:14,920
Pulver wouldn't have the guts.
Go on, go on.

1295
01:39:15,487 --> 01:39:16,591
Roberts.

1296
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:20,793
Roberts! That's the one!

1297
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:24,732
Get him up here. Get him up here,
right now! Get him up here!

1298
01:39:24,796 --> 01:39:26,207
Mr. Roberts will report...

1299
01:39:26,264 --> 01:39:28,437
<i>to the Captain's cabin on the double.</i>

1300
01:39:37,409 --> 01:39:40,390
Mr. Roberts will report
to the Captain's cabin on the double.

1301
01:39:40,445 --> 01:39:41,617
Give me that!

1302
01:39:42,814 --> 01:39:46,159
Roberts! Roberts, you get up here
in one quick hurry!

1303
01:39:46,618 --> 01:39:49,792
<i>Roberts, get a move on.
I'm giving you an order!</i>

1304
01:39:50,055 --> 01:39:51,534
<i>Do you hear me, Roberts?</i>

1305
01:39:51,589 --> 01:39:56,163
<i>This is it. You get a move on
and get up here, or this is finally...</i>

1306
01:39:56,428 --> 01:40:00,137
finally the showdown. We are going
to have it out right here and now.

1307
01:40:00,465 --> 01:40:03,207
Do you hear, Roberts?
Get up here now!

1308
01:40:04,035 --> 01:40:05,412
You want to see me, Captain?

1309
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:08,781
You did it! Don't stand there
and lie to me. Confess it!

1310
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:14,254
Confess what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1311
01:40:14,312 --> 01:40:16,849
You know what I'm talking about
because you did it!

1312
01:40:17,248 --> 01:40:20,354
<i>You've double-crossed me!
You've gone back on your word!</i>

1313
01:40:20,585 --> 01:40:21,427
<i>No, I haven't, Captain.</i>

1314
01:40:21,486 --> 01:40:25,491
<i>Yes, you have! Yes, you have.
I kept my part of the bargain.</i>

1315
01:40:25,657 --> 01:40:29,264
<i>I gave this crew liberty!
I gave this crew liberty...</i>

1316
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:31,463
<i>but you've gone back on your word.</i>

1317
01:40:31,629 --> 01:40:33,631
<i>You promised me on your word of honor!</i>

1318
01:40:33,898 --> 01:40:37,175
<i>I kept my word. I haven't written
any more letters.</i>

1319
01:40:39,537 --> 01:40:42,541
I'm not talking about
your stinking letters.

1320
01:40:42,907 --> 01:40:44,887
I'm talking about what you did tonight!

1321
01:40:44,943 --> 01:40:48,322
Tonight? I don't understand you, Captain.
What do you think I did tonight?

1322
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:49,791
You know what you did!

1323
01:40:51,483 --> 01:40:53,156
You stabbed me in the back!

1324
01:40:54,519 --> 01:40:55,998
You stabbed me in the...

1325
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:09,542
Will the Doctor please report
to the Captain's cabin on the double!

1326
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:20,512
<i>Will the doctor please report
to the Captain's cabin on the double!</i>

1327
01:41:28,119 --> 01:41:30,156
Hey, Lindstrom, where is the old man?

1328
01:41:30,321 --> 01:41:32,631
He's sittin' in a chair,
leaning way forward.

1329
01:41:32,891 --> 01:41:34,199
What's the Doc doing?

1330
01:41:34,325 --> 01:41:36,305
Doc's holding a wastebasket.

1331
01:41:36,394 --> 01:41:37,566
What wastebasket?

1332
01:41:37,695 --> 01:41:39,732
The one the old man's got his head in.

1333
01:41:41,633 --> 01:41:43,112
There he goes again!

1334
01:41:44,235 --> 01:41:45,714
They got him to the couch.

1335
01:41:47,939 --> 01:41:49,282
That's it.

1336
01:41:50,442 --> 01:41:54,151
Now we mustn't let ourselves
get angry, Captain.

1337
01:41:54,946 --> 01:41:56,755
We know that, don't we?

1338
01:42:08,426 --> 01:42:09,905
Look out, here they come.

1339
01:42:13,665 --> 01:42:15,804
We'll not need the stretcher now.
Sorry.

1340
01:42:17,402 --> 01:42:18,437
Chief?

1341
01:42:19,871 --> 01:42:20,872
Yes, sir.

1342
01:42:21,072 --> 01:42:23,985
Pass the word to the men
to secure from general quarters.

1343
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,554
See you later.

1344
01:42:33,384 --> 01:42:36,365
<i>Now hear this! Now hear this!</i>

1345
01:42:36,554 --> 01:42:38,397
Secure from general quarters.

1346
01:42:43,428 --> 01:42:44,964
Good night, Mr. Roberts.

1347
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:47,173
Good night, Reber.

1348
01:43:38,483 --> 01:43:41,191
Okay, Mr. Roberts. I'll take these down
to the gangway.

1349
01:43:41,252 --> 01:43:45,359
The boat from the island should be out
here any minute for you. I'll let you know.

1350
01:43:45,590 --> 01:43:47,234
Never thought you'd be taking this trip,
did you?

1351
01:43:47,258 --> 01:43:49,602
I'll be off this bucket
before I even wake up.

1352
01:43:49,761 --> 01:43:51,741
They're flying you all the way
to the Livingston?

1353
01:43:51,796 --> 01:43:55,505
I don't know. Dispatch said,
"Transfer, travel by air, if possible."

1354
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,905
They're landing planes at Okinawa now.

1355
01:43:57,969 --> 01:44:00,381
That's where my can's
probably running around.

1356
01:44:01,306 --> 01:44:04,515
Okinawa?
You be mighty careful, Doug boy.

1357
01:44:07,045 --> 01:44:10,049
Doc, I even got a destroyer:
The Livingston.

1358
01:44:10,515 --> 01:44:13,257
I know a guy on the Livingston.
He don't think it's so hot.

1359
01:44:13,318 --> 01:44:16,458
Here your are, Mr. Roberts. I typed up
three copies of the radio dispatch.

1360
01:44:16,521 --> 01:44:19,001
I have to keep one copy
and here's two for you.

1361
01:44:19,357 --> 01:44:24,204
You are now officially detached
from this here bucket. Let me be the first.

1362
01:44:26,297 --> 01:44:29,039
How about these orders?
I haven't sent in a letter for a month.

1363
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:31,239
Listen, I can tell you exactly
how that happened.

1364
01:44:31,302 --> 01:44:34,840
You see, those guys in Washington
need men awful bad for combat duty.

1365
01:44:35,073 --> 01:44:36,784
They lookinged through
some of the old letters...

1366
01:44:36,808 --> 01:44:38,583
and come across one of yours.

1367
01:44:38,710 --> 01:44:42,351
Listen, we can't stand here
beating our gums. The old man says:

1368
01:44:42,914 --> 01:44:46,794
"If he ain't out of here in one hour,
I'll throw him off!"

1369
01:44:47,385 --> 01:44:49,296
- Is that all he said?
- That's all he said.

1370
01:44:49,354 --> 01:44:52,801
After fighting this thing for two years,
you'd think he'd say more than that.

1371
01:44:52,857 --> 01:44:57,135
Guard, <i>I don't</i> want no man closer
than ten feet! Understand?

1372
01:44:57,762 --> 01:44:58,762
What's that?

1373
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:01,570
A new botanical garden.
Ain't you heard?

1374
01:45:02,734 --> 01:45:06,113
When we anchored this morning,
he sent Olsen out with a special detail.

1375
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:07,615
Dug up a new palm tree.

1376
01:45:07,839 --> 01:45:12,481
He's already set a 24-hour watch on that
new baby, with orders to shoot to kill!

1377
01:45:13,311 --> 01:45:16,952
That reminds me, Ensign Pulver,
the Captain wants to see you right away.

1378
01:45:17,382 --> 01:45:19,157
- What about?
- I don't know, sir.

1379
01:45:19,284 --> 01:45:22,993
I'll come back to say good-bye later,
Mr. Roberts. Come on, Ensign Pulver.

1380
01:45:23,588 --> 01:45:26,797
I bet those guys down in the laundry
starched his pajamas again!

1381
01:45:29,627 --> 01:45:31,732
- You're pretty happy, aren't you?
- Yep.

1382
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:34,306
You're happy about it,
too, aren't you, Doc?

1383
01:45:34,632 --> 01:45:36,543
I think it's the only thing for you.

1384
01:45:38,536 --> 01:45:40,277
What do you think of the crew now?

1385
01:45:40,338 --> 01:45:42,511
They're all right. They're nice guys.

1386
01:45:44,475 --> 01:45:46,318
How do you think they feel about you?

1387
01:45:46,377 --> 01:45:49,415
They like me well enough,
till the next guy comes along.

1388
01:45:50,315 --> 01:45:52,386
You don't think you're necessary to them?

1389
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:55,021
Doc, no officer is necessary to a crew.

1390
01:45:56,521 --> 01:45:58,865
Are you going to leave this ship
believing that?

1391
01:45:58,923 --> 01:46:00,163
It's nothing against them, Doc.

1392
01:46:00,224 --> 01:46:03,762
They're too busy lookin' out for themselves
to worry about anybody else.

1393
01:46:04,529 --> 01:46:07,009
Well, take a good, deep breath, Buster.

1394
01:46:11,269 --> 01:46:13,681
What do you think got you your orders?

1395
01:46:14,072 --> 01:46:17,281
Prayer and fasting?
Sending in enough box tops?

1396
01:46:17,909 --> 01:46:20,150
Dolan said one of my old letters turned up.

1397
01:46:22,046 --> 01:46:23,855
This crew got you transferred.

1398
01:46:24,449 --> 01:46:26,827
They were so busy
thinking about themselves...

1399
01:46:26,884 --> 01:46:31,162
that they took a chance of landing in
prison for five years, every one of them.

1400
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:36,070
You couldn't send in a letter for transfer,
so they sent one in for you.

1401
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:39,067
They knew the Captain wouldn't
sign it approved...

1402
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:41,804
so they didn't bother him.
They signed it for him.

1403
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:44,445
Doc, what do you mean?
They forged the Captain's name?

1404
01:46:44,469 --> 01:46:45,812
That's it exactly.

1405
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:51,284
It was quite a thing to see, Doug...

1406
01:46:51,609 --> 01:46:54,055
the Captain's name-signing contest.

1407
01:46:54,245 --> 01:46:56,953
Every man in the crew trying his best...

1408
01:46:57,181 --> 01:47:00,219
to copy that little
scrawl of the Captain's.

1409
01:47:01,552 --> 01:47:04,294
Then the judges decided the winner.

1410
01:47:05,423 --> 01:47:08,461
At the time, there was some criticism
of their decision...

1411
01:47:08,526 --> 01:47:10,904
on the grounds that the judges
were drunk.

1412
01:47:11,529 --> 01:47:14,669
But apparently from the results,
they chose pretty well.

1413
01:47:15,867 --> 01:47:17,574
How did you find out about it?

1414
01:47:18,803 --> 01:47:20,476
Well, it was a great honor.

1415
01:47:22,173 --> 01:47:24,380
I'm the only officer aboard who knows.

1416
01:47:26,043 --> 01:47:27,386
I was a contestant.

1417
01:47:28,312 --> 01:47:29,814
I was also a judge.

1418
01:47:30,248 --> 01:47:34,822
This double honor was accorded me
because of my character...

1419
01:47:35,186 --> 01:47:37,291
charm, good looks...

1420
01:47:38,356 --> 01:47:41,098
and because the medical department
contributed...

1421
01:47:41,225 --> 01:47:44,263
four gallons of grain alcohol
to the contest.

1422
01:47:47,932 --> 01:47:50,003
Who won? Who signed it?

1423
01:47:52,303 --> 01:47:56,115
I'm not at liberty to say.
Basically, they all did.

1424
01:47:57,241 --> 01:47:59,551
And with just one idea in mind:

1425
01:48:00,878 --> 01:48:03,256
To do something for Mr. Roberts.

1426
01:48:08,152 --> 01:48:09,722
I wish you hadn't told me.

1427
01:48:12,423 --> 01:48:15,131
It makes me look pretty silly
after what I just said.

1428
01:48:17,028 --> 01:48:18,598
But I didn't mean it, Doc.

1429
01:48:20,097 --> 01:48:22,270
I was afraid to say what I really feel.

1430
01:48:24,235 --> 01:48:25,714
I love those guys.

1431
01:48:27,338 --> 01:48:29,875
I think they're the greatest guys
on this Earth.

1432
01:48:31,776 --> 01:48:35,588
All of a sudden I feel there's something
terribly wrong about leaving them.

1433
01:48:38,082 --> 01:48:39,561
What can I say to them?

1434
01:48:40,084 --> 01:48:42,291
Nothing. You don't know about it.

1435
01:48:44,322 --> 01:48:49,237
After you're safely aboard your new ship I'm
supposed to write and tell you about it.

1436
01:48:51,095 --> 01:48:53,507
At the bottom of the letter I'm to say:

1437
01:48:54,999 --> 01:48:57,240
"Thanks for the liberty, Mr. Roberts."

1438
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:01,045
"Thanks for everything."

1439
01:49:26,497 --> 01:49:28,602
I'm the new cargo officer.

1440
01:49:30,234 --> 01:49:33,272
And that ain't all. I've gotta have dinner
with him tonight.

1441
01:49:33,471 --> 01:49:34,506
He likes me!

1442
01:49:36,507 --> 01:49:37,508
Come in.

1443
01:49:38,809 --> 01:49:39,549
What's that?

1444
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:42,352
Fire and rescue party!
We heard you had a fire in here.

1445
01:49:42,747 --> 01:49:43,991
No, but as long as you're here...

1446
01:49:44,015 --> 01:49:48,464
A false alarm, then? In that case,
we might as well drink this stuff.

1447
01:49:50,821 --> 01:49:53,392
What's in that?
A new batch of jungle juice?

1448
01:49:53,925 --> 01:49:56,132
In the handy new portable container.

1449
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:14,116
Everybody loaded?

1450
01:50:14,312 --> 01:50:16,883
All right, you guys, you can come in now.

1451
01:50:27,158 --> 01:50:28,330
What is it?

1452
01:50:29,527 --> 01:50:30,527
Open it.

1453
01:50:36,567 --> 01:50:37,978
What is it, Doug?

1454
01:50:42,974 --> 01:50:44,544
It's a palm tree, see.

1455
01:50:44,875 --> 01:50:46,821
It was Dowdy's idea.

1456
01:50:47,812 --> 01:50:50,588
Mannion made it.
He cut it out of sheet brass.

1457
01:50:50,881 --> 01:50:52,690
Mannion drew the words on it, too.

1458
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,457
Stefanowski thought up the words.

1459
01:50:54,518 --> 01:50:58,330
Booksie gets credit for the ribbon, from
a box of candy he got from his mother.

1460
01:51:00,124 --> 01:51:03,571
Read the words, Mr. Roberts.

1461
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:07,041
"Order of..."

1462
01:51:20,077 --> 01:51:21,784
"Order of the Palm."

1463
01:51:22,413 --> 01:51:24,950
"To Lieutenant J.G. Douglas Roberts."

1464
01:51:25,783 --> 01:51:30,596
"For action against the enemy,
above and beyond the call of duty."

1465
01:51:38,029 --> 01:51:40,635
It's very nice,
but I think you've got the wrong guy.

1466
01:51:41,165 --> 01:51:43,702
We know, sir.
But we'd like you to have it anyway.

1467
01:51:45,836 --> 01:51:47,315
Okay, I'll keep it.

1468
01:51:47,505 --> 01:51:49,485
Stefanowski thought up the words.

1469
01:51:50,408 --> 01:51:51,580
They're fine words.

1470
01:51:53,044 --> 01:51:55,388
The boat's here, Mr. Roberts.
I put your gear in.

1471
01:51:55,446 --> 01:51:57,357
They want to shove off right away.

1472
01:52:05,456 --> 01:52:07,766
- We haven't had our drink yet.
- No, sir.

1473
01:52:08,292 --> 01:52:11,466
You won't get any jungle juice
aboard that destroyer, Mr. Roberts.

1474
01:52:11,929 --> 01:52:13,272
That's right, Dowdy.

1475
01:52:24,775 --> 01:52:27,551
Good-bye, Doc. And thanks.

1476
01:52:28,546 --> 01:52:31,459
Good-bye, Frank.
Remember, I'm counting on you!

1477
01:53:26,337 --> 01:53:29,216
<i>Mail call will be
on the forward hatch immediately.</i>

1478
01:53:38,149 --> 01:53:40,686
Newspapers. Eight weeks old.

1479
01:53:44,054 --> 01:53:47,934
Ensign Pulver, we just heard.
No movies again tonight!

1480
01:53:48,425 --> 01:53:49,233
Why not?

1481
01:53:49,293 --> 01:53:53,469
He said we was making too much noise.
We wasn't making too much noise.

1482
01:53:54,064 --> 01:53:55,668
Talk to him, will you, Ensign Pulver?

1483
01:53:55,733 --> 01:53:58,805
What me? To the Captain? Yeah.

1484
01:54:02,706 --> 01:54:04,117
- Bookser?
- Yes, sir.

1485
01:54:04,375 --> 01:54:06,184
- Lindstrom?
- Yes, sir.

1486
01:54:06,610 --> 01:54:08,248
- Dolan?
- Here, sir.

1487
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:10,720
- Stefanowski?
- Right here, sir.

1488
01:54:21,792 --> 01:54:24,568
My mother, all she ever says is,
"Stay away from Japan."

1489
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:26,865
What's your news, Doc?

1490
01:54:29,333 --> 01:54:31,904
My wife got some new wallpaper
for the living room.

1491
01:54:34,104 --> 01:54:35,105
Pretty.

1492
01:54:39,944 --> 01:54:41,014
Alabama.

1493
01:54:42,112 --> 01:54:43,921
I shall read that one later.

1494
01:54:45,249 --> 01:54:47,729
- Hey, Doc. This is from Doug.
- Yeah?

1495
01:54:47,785 --> 01:54:49,128
What does he say?

1496
01:54:49,186 --> 01:54:52,463
Hey, you guys. You want to hear a letter
from Mr. Roberts?

1497
01:54:58,462 --> 01:54:59,736
"Dear Frank..."

1498
01:55:00,431 --> 01:55:02,809
"This will be short and sweet..."

1499
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,974
"as we're shoving off
in about two minutes."

1500
01:55:06,971 --> 01:55:09,042
This was dated three weeks ago.

1501
01:55:09,506 --> 01:55:10,849
Does he say where he is?

1502
01:55:10,908 --> 01:55:14,583
Yeah, he says, "My guess about the
location of this ship is exactly right."

1503
01:55:14,645 --> 01:55:16,625
That means he's around Okinawa.

1504
01:55:20,417 --> 01:55:22,522
<i>He met Fume“.</i>

1505
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:25,791
That friend of mine, guy named Fornell
I went to college with?

1506
01:55:25,856 --> 01:55:27,130
This is what he says:

1507
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:31,467
"Fornell says that you and he used to
load up your car with liquor in Omaha..."

1508
01:55:31,528 --> 01:55:35,374
"and sell it at an indecent profit
to the fraternity boys at Iowa city."

1509
01:55:35,432 --> 01:55:36,775
"How about that?"

1510
01:55:37,268 --> 01:55:38,474
We did, too!

1511
01:55:40,537 --> 01:55:42,915
"This part is for Doc. I've been..."

1512
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,943
Go ahead and read it. It's for both of us.

1513
01:55:46,610 --> 01:55:50,615
"Doc, I've been aboard this destroyer
for two weeks now..."

1514
01:55:50,681 --> 01:55:53,662
"and we've already been through
four air attacks."

1515
01:55:54,018 --> 01:55:55,998
"I'm in the war at last, Doc!"

1516
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:59,458
"I've caught up with that task force
that passed me by."

1517
01:55:59,924 --> 01:56:03,531
"I'm glad to be here.
I had to be here, I guess."

1518
01:56:04,128 --> 01:56:07,473
"But I'm thinking now of you, Doc,
and you, Frank."

1519
01:56:08,032 --> 01:56:12,742
"And Dolan, and Dowdy, and lnsigna
and everyone else on that bucket."

1520
01:56:13,570 --> 01:56:18,041
"All the guys everywhere who sail
from Tedium to Apathy..."

1521
01:56:18,709 --> 01:56:22,919
"and back again,
with an occasional side trip to Monotony."

1522
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:28,260
"This is a tough crew on here,
and they have a wonderful battle record."

1523
01:56:29,353 --> 01:56:33,096
"But I've discovered, Doc,
that the unseen enemy of this war..."

1524
01:56:33,457 --> 01:56:36,529
"is the boredom
that eventually becomes a faith..."

1525
01:56:37,494 --> 01:56:40,270
"and, therefore, a
terrible sort of suicide."

1526
01:56:41,198 --> 01:56:44,736
"I know now that the ones
who refuse to surrender to it..."

1527
01:56:45,202 --> 01:56:47,182
"are the strongest of all."

1528
01:56:48,005 --> 01:56:51,509
"Right now I'm looking at something
that's hanging over my desk."

1529
01:56:52,009 --> 01:56:54,080
"A preposterous hunk of brass..."

1530
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:57,751
"attached to the most bilious piece
of ribbon I've ever seen."

1531
01:56:58,182 --> 01:57:01,459
"I'd rather have it
than the Congressional Medal of Honor."

1532
01:57:02,486 --> 01:57:05,228
"It tells me what I'll
always be proudest of:."

1533
01:57:06,056 --> 01:57:09,265
"That at a time in the world
when courage counted most..."

1534
01:57:10,027 --> 01:57:12,803
lived among 62 brave men.

1535
01:57:14,631 --> 01:57:19,307
"So, Doc, and especially you, Frank,
don't let those guys down."

1536
01:57:21,138 --> 01:57:24,551
"Of course I know that by this time
they must be very happy..."

1537
01:57:24,775 --> 01:57:28,120
"because the Captain's overhead
is filled with marbles."

1538
01:57:31,882 --> 01:57:36,024
"And here comes the mail orderly.
This has to go now. I'll finish it later."

1539
01:57:36,387 --> 01:57:39,698
"Meanwhile you guys can write too,
can't you? Doug."

1540
01:57:40,858 --> 01:57:42,496
May I see that, Frank?

1541
01:57:43,927 --> 01:57:45,565
This one's from Fornell.

1542
01:57:46,930 --> 01:57:50,173
"I'd rather have it
than the Congressional Medal of Honor."

1543
01:57:53,203 --> 01:57:55,649
Well, I'm glad he found that out.

1544
01:58:04,415 --> 01:58:05,894
What's the matter?

1545
01:58:10,654 --> 01:58:12,031
What's the matter?

1546
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:21,271
Frank, what is it?

1547
01:58:27,004 --> 01:58:28,540
Mr. Roberts is dead.

1548
01:58:32,076 --> 01:58:33,578
This is from Fornell.

1549
01:58:34,978 --> 01:58:38,255
They took a Jap suicide plane and killed
everybody in a twin 40 battery...

1550
01:58:38,315 --> 01:58:40,727
and went right on through
and killed Doug...

1551
01:58:40,984 --> 01:58:43,487
and some other officer, in the wardroom.

1552
01:58:45,422 --> 01:58:47,766
They were drinking coffee when it hit.

1553
01:58:53,964 --> 01:58:55,068
Coffee?

1554
01:58:55,833 --> 01:58:59,713
Could I have that?
I'd like to post it for the crew.

1555
01:59:04,875 --> 01:59:08,049
Post this instead. It's theirs.

1556
01:59:57,494 --> 01:59:58,905
Yes, who is it?

1557
01:59:58,996 --> 02:00:04,708
It is I, Ensign Pulver, and I just threw
your stinkin' palm tree overboard.

1558
02:00:07,871 --> 02:00:11,011
Now what's all this crud
about no movie tonight?
