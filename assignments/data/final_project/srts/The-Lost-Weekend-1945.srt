1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,895
You'd better take this along, Don.
It's gonna be cold on the farm.

3
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:35,939
- How many shirts are you taking?
- Three.

4
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,941
- I'm taking five.
- Five?

5
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,174
I told them at the office
I might not be back until Tuesday.

6
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:44,510
We'll get there this afternoon.
That's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

7
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,075
We'll make it
a long, wonderful weekend.

8
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:48,702
Sounds long, all right.

9
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,163
It'll be good for you, Don,
after what you've been through.

10
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:54,207
Trees, grass,
sweet cider and buttermilk...

11
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,334
and water from that well
that's colder than any other...

12
00:02:56,434 --> 00:03:00,097
Wick, please. Why this emphasis
on liquids? Very dull liquids.

13
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,475
Sorry, Don.

14
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,472
I think it'd be a good idea
if we took along my typewriter.

15
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:10,932
What for?

16
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:13,777
I'm gonna write there,
get started on that novel.

17
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,606
- You really feel up to writing?
- Why not?

18
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,045
After what
you've been through.

19
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:21,047
I haven't touched the stuff
for 10 days now.

20
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:23,870
I know.
I know you haven't.

21
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,541
- Where is the typewriter?
- In the living room.

22
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,502
In the closet.

23
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,716
Towards the back.

24
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,687
Are you sure it's in the closet?
I can't find it.

25
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,356
Well, look by the desk.

26
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,654
Isn't it under your bed?

27
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,276
- Did you find it?
- Oh, sure.

28
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,576
Here it is.

29
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,949
Here's some paper. We'll
fix up a table on the south porch.

30
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,264
Nobody will disturb you.
I'll see to it.

31
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:13,328
Maybe Saturday, we can run down
to the country club.

32
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,747
- I'm not going near that club.
- Why not?

33
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:18,333
They're all a bunch of hypocrites.
I don't like to be whispered about.

34
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,315
"Look who's here from New York,
the Birnam brothers."

35
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:23,463
Or rather,
the nurse and the invalid.

36
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,549
Stop it.
Nobody there knows about you.

37
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:28,385
The minute we get off the train,
the alarm is sounded.

38
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,437
"The leper is back.
Hide your liquor."

39
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,483
- That's Helen.
- I'll take it.

40
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,396
- Helen.
- Hello, Wick. Where's Don?

41
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:42,440
I'm glad I made it.
I was afraid you'd be gone. Presents.

42
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,901
The new Thurber book
with comical jokes and pictures...

43
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,466
a nice, quiet little double-murder
by Agatha Christie...

44
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:48,780
cigarettes, gum.

45
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,782
And darling, have a wonderful time.

46
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:52,909
And don't forget:
lots of sleep, lots of milk...

47
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,580
Lots of cider and lots of
nice cold water from the well.

48
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Bend down.

49
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,463
I must be going.
I'm ten minutes late for the concert.

50
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:07,215
- So long, Wick.
- What concert?

51
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:11,386
Carnegie Hall. Bob Roller's conducting.
They gave me two tickets at the office.

52
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:13,388
- Who are you going with?
- Nobody.

53
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:16,725
Nobody? What are they playing?

54
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:20,937
Brahms second symphony, some Beethoven,
Handel and not one note of Greek.

55
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:23,064
- Sounds wonderful.
- Good-bye, boys. See you Monday.

56
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:24,837
- Tuesday.
- Wait a minute.

57
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:27,319
- I just had a crazy idea.
- For instance?

58
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,675
Who says we have to take
the 3:15 train?

59
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:32,824
- We could go on the 6:30.
- What are you talking about?

60
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:36,286
If we took a later train, Helen
wouldn't have to go the concert alone.

61
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:38,788
She's got two tickets,
hasn't she?

62
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,521
No, I'm not going to upset
any of your plans.

63
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,793
You're going on the 3:15.

64
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,046
Helen, that's so silly.

65
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,194
A whale of a concert,
an empty seat next to you.

66
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:49,841
Everything's all set.

67
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,927
They'll be at the station to meet us
and dinner will be waiting.

68
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:55,680
Put in a call that we're taking a later
train, dinner at 9:00, in bed by 10:00.

69
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,724
- Nothing doing. We're going.
- Wick is right.

70
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,561
Don't worry about that seat. I'll find
a handsome, South American millionaire.

71
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,398
There you are. Besides, we have to break
our necks anyway to catch the train.

72
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,879
- Five to 3:00.
- You see?

73
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,538
- Don't be so stubborn.
- All right, go ahead.

74
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:16,535
- Just a minute. I'm not going.
- Then what are we talking about?

75
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:19,392
- I want you to go, you and Helen.
- Me and Helen?

76
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,498
That's the idea.
Who likes Brahms, you or I?

77
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:26,253
- Since when don't you like Brahms?
- I'll just finish packing, take a nap.

78
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,068
Nonsense. If anybody goes...
Helen's your girl.

79
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:32,759
- There's something in that, Don.
- What's more, you shouldn't be alone.

80
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,220
I shouldn't?
I'm not to be trusted, is that it?

81
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,347
- Really, darling.
- After what you've been through...

82
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:39,558
I couldn't go to the concert.
I couldn't face the crowds.

83
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:41,560
I couldn't sit through it
with all those people.

84
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,916
Besides, I wanna be alone
a couple hours to assemble myself.

85
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,918
Is that such
an extraordinary thing to want?

86
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:48,483
Don't act so outraged.
Would you mind?

87
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,286
- All right. Anything else?
- Please, boys.

88
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,574
Come on, Helen.

89
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:58,243
- You'll stay right here.
- Where would I go?

90
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:00,871
- Then you'll be here when we get back?
- I'm not leaving this apartment.

91
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:02,831
You told us a good many things.

92
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:05,750
If you don't believe me take my keys,
lock me in like a dog!

93
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,970
We've got to trust Don.
That's the only way.

94
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,424
Sorry, Don.
Let's go, Helen.

95
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:14,851
- So long, Don.
- So long.

96
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,019
Bend down.

97
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,970
- What's this?
- Whiskey, isn't it?

98
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,972
- How did it get there?
- I don't know.

99
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:43,914
I suppose it dropped from some cloud, or
someone bounced it and it stuck there.

100
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:46,666
- I guess I must have put it there.
- Yes, you must.

101
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,649
But I don't remember when.
Probably during my last spell.

102
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,722
Maybe the one before.
I don't know.

103
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,884
Don't look at me like that.
It doesn't mean a thing.

104
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:58,491
I didn't know it was there.
If I had, I wouldn't have touched it.

105
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:00,939
- Then you won't mind.
- Mind what?

106
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,656
- Now, you trot along with Helen.
- Why? Because of that?

107
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:20,283
You think I wanted you out
because of the bottle?

108
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,849
I resent that like the devil.
One more word of discussion...

109
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,393
I don't leave on your blasted weekend!

110
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:27,049
Let's go.

111
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,923
You'll be good, won't you, darling?

112
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:37,363
Yes. Will you stop
watching me all the time?

113
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,803
Let me work it out my way.
I'm trying. I'm trying!

114
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:42,138
We know you're trying.

115
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,766
We're both trying.
You're trying not to drink...

116
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:47,569
and I'm trying not to love you.

117
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,047
Call the farm and tell them
we're taking the 6:30.

118
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,147
Sure.

119
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,747
So long.

120
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,703
Come on.
He'll be all right.

121
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:06,705
What if he goes out
and buys another bottle?

122
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:08,915
He hasn't a nickel.
There isn't a store or a bar...

123
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,938
that'll give him
five cents' worth of credit.

124
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:12,940
Are you sure he doesn't have
another bottle hidden?

125
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,902
I went over the apartment
with a fine-tooth comb.

126
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,391
The places he can figure out.

127
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,727
Who is it?
Who is it?

128
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,154
Mrs. Foley.
I've come to clean up.

129
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:32,399
Does it have to be today?

130
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,382
I ought to change the sheets,
and it's my day to vacuum.

131
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:38,572
- Come on Monday.
- All right, Mr. Birnam.

132
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,179
- Is your brother in?
- No, he isn't.

133
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,913
What about my money?
Didn't he leave my money?

134
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,395
- What money?
- My ten dollars.

135
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:51,502
- Didn't he leave it?
- Probably. Where would he leave it?

136
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:54,547
- In the kitchen.
- Where in the kitchen?

137
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:56,599
In the sugar bowl.

138
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,685
just a minute.

139
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:16,485
I'm sorry, it isn't there.
He must have forgotten.

140
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:19,822
I wanted to do some shopping.

141
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:22,792
- You'll get it Monday.
- All right, Mr. Birnam.

142
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,081
- Two bottles of rye.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Birnam.

143
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:52,250
- What are you sorry about?
- Your brother was in.

144
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,575
He's not gonna pay for you anymore.
That was the last time.

145
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:59,257
- Two bottles of rye.
- What brand?

146
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:01,989
You know what brand.
The cheapest.

147
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,242
None of that 1 2-year-old,
aged-in-the-wood chichi for me.

148
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:07,369
- Liquor's all one anyway.
- You want a bag?

149
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:09,380
Yes, I want a bag.

150
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,710
Your brother said not to sell to you
even if you had the money.

151
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,776
I can't stop anybody, can I?
Not unless you're a minor.

152
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm not a minor.
And just to ease your conscience...

153
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,768
I'm buying this to refill
my cigarette lighter.

154
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:37,491
Yes, sir?

155
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:41,243
Thank you.

156
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:48,140
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Deveridge.
- Hello, Mr. Birnam.

157
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,756
That's the nice young man
who drinks.

158
00:12:56,719 --> 00:13:00,381
- How is my very good friend Nat today?
- Yes, Mr. Birnam?

159
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,383
This being an especially
fine afternoon...

160
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:05,636
I have decided to ask
your hand in marriage.

161
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:08,722
If that's your attitude, I'll have to
drown my sorrows with a jigger of rye.

162
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,413
- Just one, that's all.
- It can't be done.

163
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:14,249
It can't?
Let me guess why.

164
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:16,897
My brother was here undermining
my financial structure.

165
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,400
I didn't tell him nothing about
the wristwatch or the cuff links.

166
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,777
Thank you very much, Nat.
Today you'll be glad to know...

167
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:24,572
we can barter on a cash basis.

168
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:26,791
- One straight rye.
- That was the idea.

169
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,447
Don't wipe it away.

170
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:08,833
Let me have my little vicious circle.

171
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:13,245
You know, the circle
is the perfect geometric figure.

172
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:15,790
No end, no beginning.

173
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,626
- What time is it?
- A quarter of 4:00.

174
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,836
Good. We have
the whole afternoon together.

175
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:23,514
Let me know when it's a quarter
of 6:00. It's very important.

176
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,322
I'm going to the country
for a weekend with my brother.

177
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:30,638
Hello, Mr. Birnam. Happy to have you
back with the organization.

178
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:33,849
Hello, Gloria.
I wish I could take you along, Nat.

179
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,811
You and all that goes with you...

180
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:41,324
not that I'm cutting myself off
from civilization altogether.

181
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:48,447
Now, of course, there arises the problem
of transportation into the country.

182
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:51,659
How to smuggle these two time bombs
past the Royal Guard.

183
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,286
<i>I'll roll one bottle in a copy
of the Saturday Evening Post...</i>

184
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,413
so my brother
can discover it like that.

185
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:59,208
I want him to discover it.
It'll set his mind at ease.

186
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:02,732
The other bottle...
Come here.

187
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:05,881
That one I'm tucking
into my brother's suitcase.

188
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:08,843
He shall transport it himself
without knowing it, of course.

189
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:11,053
Then while he's greeting
the caretaker...

190
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:16,142
I'll slide it out, hide it
in a hollow old apple tree.

191
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:19,645
Mr. Birnam, why don't you
lay off the stuff for a while?

192
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:22,314
I may never touch it
while I'm there, not a drop.

193
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:25,943
What all of you don't understand is
I've got to know it's around.

194
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:28,571
I can't be cut off completely.
That's the devil.

195
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,281
That's what drives you crazy.

196
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:33,054
Yeah, I know a lot of guys like that.

197
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:35,390
They take a bottle
and put it on the shelf.

198
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,623
All they wanna do is look at it.
They'll corkscrew it to make sure.

199
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:44,170
Then all of the sudden, they
grab the bottle, bite off the neck.

200
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,612
One more reproving word, I shall
consult our lawyer about a divorce.

201
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:51,635
Don't forget, quarter of 6:00.
My brother must find me home...

202
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,646
ready and packed.

203
00:15:56,107 --> 00:15:57,692
Shall we dance?

204
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,353
You're awfully pretty, Mr. Birnam.

205
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:03,147
I bet you tell that
to all the boys.

206
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:05,941
Why, natch.
Only with you, it's on the level.

207
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,694
- Sit down.
- No, thanks.

208
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,873
Thanks a lot, but no, thanks.
There's somebody waiting.

209
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,242
Him? I bet he wears arch supporters.

210
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,244
He's just an old friend of the folks.

211
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,268
Lovely gentleman.
He buys me scotch.

212
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:24,376
He should buy you rubies and a villa
in Calcutta overlooking the Ganges.

213
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:27,129
- Don't be "ridic."
- Gloria, please.

214
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:30,433
Why imperil our friendship
with these loathsome abbreviations?

215
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:34,449
I could make myself free
for later on, if you want.

216
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:37,681
I'm going away for the weekend.
Some other time.

217
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,381
Anytime.

218
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:42,195
I'm just crazy about
the back of your hair.

219
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,779
Nat, weave me another.

220
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,156
- You'd better take it easy.
- Oh, don't worry about me.

221
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,867
just let me know
when it's a quarter of 6:00.

222
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,787
Come on, join me.
One little jigger of dreams.

223
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:03,040
- No, thanks.
- You don't approve of drinking?

224
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,021
Not the way you drink.

225
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:07,524
It shrinks my liver, doesn't it?

226
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:09,880
It pickles my kidneys, yes.

227
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,863
But what does it do to my mind?

228
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:16,324
It tosses the sandbags overboard
so the balloon can soar.

229
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:19,849
Suddenly, I'm above the ordinary.
I'm confident, supremely confident.

230
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,393
I'm walking a tightrope
over Niagra Falls.

231
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,186
I'm one of the great ones.

232
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:27,022
I'm Michelangelo
molding the beard of Moses.

233
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:28,899
I'm van Gogh painting pure sunlight.

234
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:32,111
I'm Horowitz playing
the "Emperor Concerto."

235
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,864
I'm John Barrymore before
the movies got him by the throat.

236
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:38,075
I'm Jesse James and his two brothers.
All three of them!

237
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:40,682
I'm William Shakespeare.

238
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:43,080
And out there,
it's not 3rd Avenue any longer.

239
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,499
It's the Nile...

240
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,469
and down it floats
the barge of Cleopatra.

241
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:52,012
Come here.

242
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:56,927
"Purple the sails, and so perfumed
that the winds were lovesick with them.

243
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:58,700
The oars were silver...

244
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,898
which to the tune of flutes
kept stroke."

245
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:07,563
Maybe he's at Mirandi's or Nat's Bar,
that place on 42nd Street.

246
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,586
What difference does it make?

247
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:12,067
- You're not really going?
- I certainly am.

248
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,029
- You can't leave him alone four days.
- Yes, I can.

249
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:18,199
Oh, for heaven's sake.
If he's left alone, anything can happen.

250
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,931
I'm tied up at the office every minute
all Saturday, all Sunday.

251
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,579
I can't look out for him.
You know how he gets.

252
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,082
He'll be run over by a car.
He'll be arrested.

253
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:29,919
A cigarette might fall from his mouth,
and he'd burn in bed.

254
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,546
If it happens it happens,
and I hope it does.

255
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,725
I've had six years of this.
I've had my belly full!

256
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:40,283
- You can't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

257
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:42,932
- It's terrible, I know, but I mean it.
- For heaven's sakes...

258
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:46,602
Who are we fooling?
We've tried everything, haven't we?

259
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:49,626
We've reasoned with him, babied him,
watched him like a hawk.

260
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,525
We've tried trusting him.
How often have you tried?

261
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,652
How often have I beaten him up?

262
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:58,447
Scrape him out of a gutter and pump
some kind of self-respect into him...

263
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:01,834
and back he falls,
back in every time.

264
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:04,787
He's a sick person.

265
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:07,811
It's as though something were wrong
with his heart or lungs.

266
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:11,127
You wouldn't walk out on him
if he had an attack. He needs our help.

267
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:13,963
He won't accept our help.
He hates us.

268
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:16,549
He wants to be alone
with that bottle of his.

269
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:18,559
It's all he gives a hang about.

270
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,349
Why kid ourselves?

271
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:28,352
He's a hopeless alcoholic.

272
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:32,281
"The cloud-capped towers,
the gorgeous palaces...

273
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:37,361
The solemn temples,
the great globe itself."

274
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:39,655
Mr. Birnam, you ought to go home.
It's late.

275
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:42,116
"Yea, all which it inherit
shall dissolve."

276
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:44,118
You ought to go home
on account of your brother.

277
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:46,662
- Who says so?
- You said you're going away somewhere.

278
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:49,540
- Don't you remember?
- What time is it?

279
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,584
- Ten past 6:00.
- Why didn't you tell me?

280
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:53,919
What do you think I've been doing
for half an hour?

281
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:56,055
Your change!

282
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:36,126
Taxi! Taxi!

283
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:38,297
I'll give you a lift
as far as Grand Central.

284
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:41,217
- No, thanks. I'm gonna wait here.
- You're crazy.

285
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:44,241
Because I won't give up?
Maybe I am.

286
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:46,889
Let go of him.
Give yourself a chance.

287
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:48,566
Good-bye, Wick.

288
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:51,290
I thought you was
going away for the weekend.

289
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,344
What are you doing?
Give me a drink.

290
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:01,596
Be right with you.
just fixing myself some lunch.

291
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:04,683
Stop it and give me a drink.
Come on. Come on!

292
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:05,783
Okay.

293
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:10,656
- Can't you hurry it up a little?
- Here you are.

294
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:14,242
That young lady stopped in
last night looking for you.

295
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,155
- What young lady?
- The one with the leopard coat.

296
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:20,255
Yeah?

297
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:22,722
She acted like
she just happened to drop in.

298
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:24,724
But I know she was making
the rounds after you.

299
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:27,539
- What did you say?
- You haven't been in for two weeks.

300
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:30,625
That's good. I can't let her see me,
not when I'm off like this.

301
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:34,901
- Why don't you cut it short?
- I can't cut it short.

302
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,465
Get on the merry-go-round,
you gotta ride it all the way.

303
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:40,051
'Round and 'round till that
blasted music wears itself out...

304
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:42,429
and the thing dies down
and clunks to a stop.

305
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:45,640
- How about you eating some of this?
- Take it away.

306
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,934
You gotta eat something sometime.

307
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:50,270
just give me another drink.

308
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,731
Mr. Birnam, this is the morning.

309
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:56,193
That's when you need it most.
Haven't you learned that yet?

310
00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:58,737
At night, the stuff's a drink.
In the morning, it's medicine.

311
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:02,276
- Okay if I eat?
- A little to one side.

312
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:10,624
Are you ever scared when you wake up?
So scared the sweat starts out of you?

313
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,543
No, not you.
With you it's simple.

314
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,694
The alarm clock goes off,
you open your eyes...

315
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:18,989
<i>brush your teeth
and read the Daily Mirror.</i>

316
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:21,721
You ever lie in your bed,
looking at the window?

317
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,619
A little daylight's coming through,
and you start to wonder.

318
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,788
Is it getting lighter?
Is it getting darker?

319
00:25:26,888 --> 00:25:30,667
Is it dawn or is it dusk?
That's a terrifying problem.

320
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,836
Because if it's dawn, you're dead.

321
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:35,568
The bars are closed,
the liquor stores don't open until 9:00.

322
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,599
You can't last until 9:00!

323
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:42,575
Or it may be Sunday.
That's the worst.

324
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:46,683
No liquor stores at all, and you guys
wouldn't open a bar until 1 :00. Why?

325
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:49,353
Because we gotta go to church
once in a while.

326
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:51,905
Yeah, when a guy needs it most.

327
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:56,568
What happened to those two quarts?
Did you polish them off last night?

328
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:59,079
- What two quarts?
- The two bottles you had.

329
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:03,408
That's right,
I did have two bottles, didn't I?

330
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:06,244
I hid one of them.
I've still got it.

331
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:10,215
I'm a capitalist.
I've got untapped reserves. I'm rich!

332
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:14,044
If you had enough money,
you'd kill yourself in a month.

333
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,089
Nat, was there a gentleman here...
Hello, Mr. Birnam.

334
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:19,883
- Didn't you go away for the weekend?
- Apparently not.

335
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:22,678
- Was there a gentleman asking for me?
- Not to my knowledge.

336
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:25,097
He was supposed to come around 11 :00.
He's from Albany.

337
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:28,642
- Another friend of the folks?
- More a friend of a friend of the folks.

338
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:31,228
A fellow called me up about him.
Wants me to show him the town.

339
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:33,655
- Like Grant's tomb, for instance?
- But "def."

340
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:38,577
Ain't it amazing how many guys
come from Albany to see Grant's tomb?

341
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:43,594
Sometimes, I wish
you came from Albany.

342
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:45,638
Yeah? Where would you take me?

343
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:49,037
<i>Lots of places. Music Hall,
the New Yorker roof, maybe.</i>

344
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:52,040
There is now being presented
at a theater on 44th Street...

345
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,042
<i>the uncut version of Hamlet.</i>

346
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:56,044
I see us as setting out for that.

347
00:26:56,144 --> 00:26:58,505
<i>- Do you know Hamlet?
- I know 44th Street.</i>

348
00:26:58,605 --> 00:27:01,800
I would like to get your interpretation
of Hamlet's character.

349
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,281
I'd like to give it to you.

350
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:05,283
Dinner later, I think.
Nothing before.

351
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:08,140
One should always see Shakespeare
on an empty stomach.

352
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,768
- Not even a pretzel?
- Can I have a glass of water?

353
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:14,229
Why, sure.
What'll it be for a chaser?

354
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:17,962
- This is Nat's bar, isn't it?
- That's what the man said.

355
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:21,328
I'm looking for a young lady,
name of Gloria.

356
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:28,306
- Are you Miss Gloria?
- Me? No, I'm not.

357
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:30,350
I just live with Gloria.
She's not here.

358
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,539
- She isn't?
- She's sick. She went to the hospital.

359
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:34,645
Ruptured appendix,
middle of last night.

360
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:37,315
Went like that.
Scared the life out of me.

361
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:39,254
Oh, that's terrible.

362
00:27:39,354 --> 00:27:42,099
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

363
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:49,160
Could I have a word with you?

364
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,163
No, thanks.
Thanks a lot, but no, thanks.

365
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:54,695
- You're welcome.
- Don't "mench."

366
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:08,450
Now, wasn't it rather rude to send that
nice man all alone to Grant's tomb?

367
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,494
When I've got a chance
to go out with you?

368
00:28:10,594 --> 00:28:13,685
- Don't be "ridic."
- Is our engagement definite?

369
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:16,792
- You meant it, didn't you?
- Surely, surely.

370
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:19,524
I've gotta get a facial, a finger wave,
the works, right now.

371
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:22,527
- You're gonna call for me, aren't you?
- What time do you suggest?

372
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:23,882
- How's 8:00?
- 8:00's fine.

373
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,531
I live right in the corner house
where the antique shop is...

374
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:28,533
the one with
the wooden Indian outside.

375
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,868
- "I got the Indian sign in me," I say.
- I'll be there.

376
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:33,100
Second floor, front.

377
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,061
Mr. Birnam,
all I got is a semiformal.

378
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:38,438
- Will that be all right?
- That'll be fine.

379
00:28:38,538 --> 00:28:39,907
So long, Nat.

380
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,268
One last one.

381
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,479
Pour it softly, pour it gently
and pour it to the brim.

382
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:48,149
Look, there are a lot of bars
on 3rd Avenue.

383
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:50,401
Do me a favor, will you?
Buy it somewhere else.

384
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:52,904
- What's the matter?
- What's the idea of pulling her leg?

385
00:28:53,004 --> 00:28:54,906
- You're not gonna take her out.
- Who says I'm not?

386
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,991
You're drunk and just
making with the mouth.

387
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:59,577
- Give me a drink.
- That other dame... the lady, I mean...

388
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:02,267
- I don't like what you're doing to her.
- Oh, shut up.

389
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,269
You should've seen her last night
looking for you...

390
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,584
her eyes all rainy
and the mascara all washed away.

391
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:09,441
- Give me a drink!
- That's an awful high-class young lady.

392
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,048
- You bet she is.
- How did she get mixed up with a guy...

393
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:14,967
- who sops it up like you do?
- It's a problem, isn't it?

394
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,282
That nice young man who drinks
and the high-class young lady.

395
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:21,286
How did she get mixed up with him?
Why does he drink? Why doesn't he stop?

396
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,059
That's my novel.

397
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,394
I oughta start writing it
out in the country.

398
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:27,960
Morbid stuff.
Nothing for the Book of the Month club.

399
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,628
A horror story.

400
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,611
<i>The Confessions of a Booze Addict:
The Long Book of an Alcoholic.</i>

401
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:36,039
Oh, come on.
Break down, will ya?

402
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,784
<i>You know what I'm gonna call my novel?
The Bottle.</i>

403
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:42,629
<i>That's all.
Very simply The Bottle.</i>

404
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:46,624
I've got it all here in my mind.

405
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:48,960
Let me tell you the first chapter.

406
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,421
It all starts one wet afternoon
about three years ago.

407
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:54,974
<i>There was a matinee of La Traviata
at the Metropolitan.</i>

408
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,828
Check your hat and coat, sir.

409
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:17,627
- Here.
- Did you forget something?

410
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:20,013
No, just going home
if it's all right with you.

411
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:30,097
- This isn't yours, is it?
- It certainly isn't.

412
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:32,538
- That's what is says... 417.
- I don't care what it says.

413
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,727
- The checks must've gotten mixed up.
- Maybe they did.

414
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:37,376
Find my coat.
It's a plain men's raincoat and a derby.

415
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:41,025
Do you know how many plain men's
raincoats we have on a day like this?

416
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,236
- About a thousand.
- I can find it.

417
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:44,716
That's against regulations, sir.

418
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,052
I am not gonna wait here
until the end of the performance.

419
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,492
- You can get your coat tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

420
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:52,036
Look, there's something in the pocket
of that coat that I...

421
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:55,790
Well, it so happens I found myself
without any money. I need that coat now!

422
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,417
Listen, if everybody went
diggin' in through those coats...

423
00:33:58,517 --> 00:34:02,129
There's regulations.
There's got to be regulations!

424
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:04,403
Then what do you suggest?

425
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,446
Wait till the other party arrives
and swap.

426
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:07,885
I want my coat!

427
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:12,148
As far as I'm concerned, mister,
that's your coat.

428
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:15,193
You're a great help.

429
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:05,109
- That's my coat you've got.
- And that's mine, thank heaven.

430
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:07,653
- They mixed up the checks.
- I thought you'd never come.

431
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:11,824
- You couldn't have waited so long.
- Since the first aria of the first act.

432
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:14,377
Do you always drop in
just for the overture?

433
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:16,921
just a minute.

434
00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:23,845
My umbrella, if you don't mind.

435
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,891
- Catch.
- Thank you very much.

436
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:34,826
I'm terribly sorry.

437
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,725
You're the rudest person I've ever seen.
What's the matter with you?

438
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:40,707
- Just rude, I guess.
- Somebody should talk to your mother.

439
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:43,835
- They tried, Miss St.John.
- My name's not St.John.

440
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,234
- St.Joseph, then.
- St.James.

441
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:49,216
First name Hilda or Helen
or Harriet, maybe.

442
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,706
- Helen.
- All right, Helen.

443
00:35:57,003 --> 00:36:00,081
- I also know you come from Toledo, Ohio.
- You do? How?

444
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:03,125
I've had three long acts
to work you out from that coat of yours.

445
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:07,505
Initials, label.
Alfred Spitzer Fine Furs, Toledo, Ohio.

446
00:36:07,605 --> 00:36:09,674
Maybe I should've explored
your coat.

447
00:36:09,774 --> 00:36:12,030
- But you didn't, though?
- Didn't have time.

448
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,366
Good. My name is Don Birnam.

449
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,973
How do you do?

450
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:19,517
- Well, how do you like New York?
- Love it.

451
00:36:19,617 --> 00:36:22,895
- You intend to stay long?
- Oh, 60 years, perhaps.

452
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:25,273
- I live here now. I have a job.
- Doing what?

453
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:28,609
<i>- Time Magazine.
- Perhaps you can do something for me.</i>

454
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:31,487
- Yes?
- Help me become "Man of the Year"?

455
00:36:31,587 --> 00:36:34,156
- Delighted. What do you do?
- Yes, what do I do?

456
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,158
I'm a writer.
I've just started a novel.

457
00:36:36,258 --> 00:36:38,661
As a matter of fact I've started
several, but I never seem to finish one.

458
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:40,663
In that case,
why don't you write short stories?

459
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:43,061
I have some of those...
first paragraph.

460
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:45,063
Then there's one half
of the opening scene of a play...

461
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:47,065
which takes place in
the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

462
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:51,757
It attempts to explain why it leans and
why all sensible buildings should lean.

463
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:54,135
- They'll love that in Toledo.
- Oh, by the way.

464
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:57,117
<i>- Are you coming to here Lohengrin?
- I don't know.</i>

465
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,745
Because if you are, I'm not letting
this coat out of my hands.

466
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,851
- Don't worry.
- But I do.

467
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,979
To be really safe,
we should go together.

468
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,251
We could.

469
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,524
Are you in the phone book?

470
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:11,869
- Yes, but I'm not home very much.
- I'd call you at your office.

471
00:37:13,162 --> 00:37:15,594
Editorial research.
If Henry Luce answers, hang up.

472
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,292
All right.

473
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:22,371
- Would you like a taxi?
- No, thanks, I'm taking the subway.

474
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,373
- Very sensible.
- As a matter of fact...

475
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:28,044
I'm going to an extremely crazy party
on Washington Square.

476
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:30,588
If you like, I'll take you along.

477
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:34,142
Thank you very much,
but I have to see a friend uptown.

478
00:37:35,893 --> 00:37:37,854
- Good-bye, Mr. Birnam.
- Good-bye.

479
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:53,694
- Who threw that?
- It fell out of my pocket.

480
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:55,988
- Do you always carry those things?
- Well, no.

481
00:37:56,088 --> 00:37:58,533
That friend of mine uptown,
he has a slight cold.

482
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:01,160
I thought I'd take this along
and make him a hot toddy.

483
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,183
See that he gets hot lemonade
and some aspirin.

484
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:05,048
- I shall.
- Good-bye.

485
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,219
Oh, Miss St.James.

486
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:14,674
- Yes?
- What kind of party did you ask me to?

487
00:38:14,774 --> 00:38:17,468
- A cocktail party.
- Does the invitation still stand?

488
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:19,479
Of course. Come on.

489
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:30,523
So they go to that party, he gets
stinko and falls flat on his face.

490
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:34,151
He does not. By this time,
he's crazy about the girl.

491
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:37,280
He drinks tomato juice.
Doesn't touch liquor that whole week.

492
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,415
- For two weeks, for six weeks.
- In love, huh?

493
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,744
That's what's gonna be
so hard to write.

494
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:46,664
Love is the hardest thing
in the world to write about.

495
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:50,168
It's so simple.
You gotta catch it through details...

496
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:52,545
like the early morning sunlight
hitting the gray tin...

497
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:54,964
of the rain spout
in front of her house.

498
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:58,968
The ringing of a telephone that
sounds like Beethoven's "Pastoral."

499
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:01,929
A letter scribbled on her office
stationary you carry in your pocket...

500
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:05,725
because it smells like
all the lilacs in Ohio.

501
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:07,402
Pour it, Nat.

502
00:39:10,238 --> 00:39:12,607
He thinks he's cured.

503
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:16,110
If he could only get a job,
they'd be married and that's that.

504
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,738
But it's not, Nat.
Not quite.

505
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:21,553
Because one day, one terrible day...

506
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,853
Go on.

507
00:39:25,628 --> 00:39:28,664
You see, this girl has been writing
to her people in Toledo.

508
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:31,897
They wanna meet the young man,
so they come to New York.

509
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:34,086
They stay at the Hotel Manhattan.

510
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:37,715
Their very first day,
she's to introduce him to her parents.

511
00:39:37,815 --> 00:39:40,435
One o'clock, lobby of the hotel.

512
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:00,571
That wasn't enough,
not for New York.

513
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:03,991
He gave me a shampoo, scalp massage
and a manicure.

514
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:07,870
I thought they were going to tear off
my shoes and paint my toenails.

515
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,998
I had a lovely morning.
just did a little window shopping.

516
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:14,043
- Didn't want to get all tired out.
- On account of meeting that young man?

517
00:40:14,143 --> 00:40:17,305
- Now, Mother.
- Who did you get that haircut for?

518
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,716
- I wonder what's keeping Helen.
- She'll be here.

519
00:40:20,816 --> 00:40:22,718
This Birnam fellow
went to Cornell, didn't he?

520
00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:26,556
- I believe so.
- He never graduated. I wonder why.

521
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:28,120
- How old is he?
- Thirty-three.

522
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,769
He has no job. As far as
I can find out, he never had one.

523
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:33,792
I wish Helen wasn't so vague.

524
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,837
Maybe he has a little money.
Some people do you know, Father.

525
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:39,610
- He ought to have a job anyway.
- He's a writer.

526
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,800
What did he write?
I never heard his name.

527
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,470
Father, relax.
You always expect the worst.

528
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,160
I hope he realizes
that Helen's our only daughter.

529
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,183
We ought to know
a few things about him.

530
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:53,958
It'll all come out...
his background, his prospects...

531
00:40:54,058 --> 00:40:55,969
his church affiliation.

532
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:39,629
Hotel Manhattan?
Could you page Miss Helen St.James.

533
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:42,140
St.James.
Yes, she's in the lobby.

534
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:00,045
Helen? Don.

535
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:03,215
I'm terribly sorry, but I won't
be able to get there for awhile.

536
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:07,386
Go ahead and have your lunch
and apologize to your parents.

537
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,763
Oh, nothing serious.
I'll be there.

538
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,419
Good-bye.

539
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:35,560
Turn off that light.

540
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,529
- Turn it off!
- For heaven's sake.

541
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:44,861
I thought you were with Helen
and her father and mother.

542
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:46,537
What happened?

543
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:52,118
- Come on.
- I couldn't face it.

544
00:42:52,218 --> 00:42:54,141
Couldn't face what?
Didn't you go to see them?

545
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:56,873
Certainly I went, 1 :00 sharp.

546
00:42:56,973 --> 00:42:59,959
I saw them, all right,
only they didn't see me.

547
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:03,275
- How was that?
- Such nice, respectable people.

548
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:06,048
I couldn't face them.
And all the questions they'd ask me?

549
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:08,259
I just couldn't do it, not cold.

550
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:12,471
I had to have a drink first, just one,
only the one didn't do anything to me.

551
00:43:12,571 --> 00:43:15,808
So you had another and another.
You poor idiot.

552
00:43:15,908 --> 00:43:18,144
Won't you ever learn that with you,
it's like stepping off a roof...

553
00:43:18,244 --> 00:43:20,167
and expecting to fall just one floor?

554
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:22,190
Will you call her?

555
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,297
Tell her something.
Tell her I'm sick, tell her I'm dead.

556
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,945
- Will you call?
- Yes, I'll call.

557
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:31,345
She must've written them
a lot of nice things about me.

558
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:33,805
What a gentleman I am,
a prince.

559
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:36,245
- Which hotel is it?
- The Manhattan.

560
00:43:36,345 --> 00:43:40,216
Mr. and Mrs. Charles St.James
of Toledo, Ohio.

561
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:49,124
Get up!

562
00:43:59,527 --> 00:44:01,446
just a minute, Helen.

563
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:16,410
- Hello, Wick. Is Don here?
- Don? No.

564
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,664
- Any idea where he could be?
- Wasn't he meeting you?

565
00:44:19,764 --> 00:44:22,834
He was supposed to meet us for lunch.
He telephoned he'd be late.

566
00:44:22,934 --> 00:44:26,024
Mother's beginning to think
I just made him up.

567
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:28,026
Do you suppose
something happened to him?

568
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:29,465
Nonsense.

569
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:31,843
But surely he'd have called back
if he were all right.

570
00:44:31,943 --> 00:44:33,845
- Where did he call you from?
- I don't know.

571
00:44:33,945 --> 00:44:36,514
I think I have an idea.
He called you from out of town.

572
00:44:36,614 --> 00:44:38,432
- Where?
- Philadelphia.

573
00:44:38,532 --> 00:44:41,602
<i>- What's he doing there?
- There's an opening at the Enquirer.</i>

574
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:46,366
Don wrote them, wired them, and I think
this morning took an early train.

575
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:50,424
He didn't tell me a word about it.

576
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:53,239
I'm not supposed to tell you either.
He wanted it to be a surprise.

577
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:54,720
- He did?
- Yes.

578
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,244
He probably couldn't meet the right
people right away. You know how it is.

579
00:44:58,344 --> 00:45:01,673
It would be wonderful if he got the job
and started working.

580
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,439
Or would it?

581
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,712
With him in Philadelphia
and me in New York.

582
00:45:07,812 --> 00:45:10,381
Don't ever tell him
I said that though, will you?

583
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:12,884
- Of course not.
- I could never understand...

584
00:45:12,984 --> 00:45:15,553
why somebody like Don,
a person with such talent...

585
00:45:15,653 --> 00:45:18,306
such flashes of real brilliance...

586
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:22,777
Maybe I'm a bit prejudiced.
What are you doing?

587
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:25,918
- Nothing.
- Where did that bottle come from?

588
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:28,482
- It just rolled out.
- From under the couch?

589
00:45:28,582 --> 00:45:29,582
Yes.

590
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:33,237
You know, it's my guess
Don caught an early train and...

591
00:45:33,337 --> 00:45:36,094
- Is that Don's bottle?
- What makes you think that?

592
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:39,368
There was a bottle
the first time we met.

593
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:42,601
- There was?
- Fell out of Don's pocket.

594
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:46,417
That was for me.
This one's mine too.

595
00:45:46,517 --> 00:45:49,942
You might as well hear
the family scandal. I drink.

596
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:52,423
Don thinks I drink too much.
I promised to go on the wagon.

597
00:45:52,523 --> 00:45:54,425
I hid the bottle
so he wouldn't see it.

598
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:56,525
I'm sorry.

599
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:59,388
I shouldn't have started
asking questions.

600
00:45:59,488 --> 00:46:01,682
It's really none of my business.

601
00:46:01,782 --> 00:46:03,601
Forget it.

602
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:05,603
I better be getting back
to the hotel.

603
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:08,001
Don's probably there already.

604
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:10,233
And don't worry.
I won't mention a word of it to him.

605
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,104
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.

606
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:20,368
I'm sorry.
I can't let you go, not like this.

607
00:46:20,468 --> 00:46:22,474
Shut your mouth, Don.
I'll take you downstairs.

608
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:25,206
Thanks very much
for your Philadelphia story.

609
00:46:25,306 --> 00:46:26,958
Nice try.

610
00:46:27,058 --> 00:46:29,794
- That looks so silly on you.
- Don't listen to him.

611
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:32,129
She doesn't have to.
just look at the two of us.

612
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:34,382
What is all this covering up?

613
00:46:34,482 --> 00:46:38,553
Don was nervous at the idea of meeting
your parents, so he had a couple drinks.

614
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:41,326
Come on. She'd have found out
sooner or later.

615
00:46:41,426 --> 00:46:43,024
Stop it, both of you.

616
00:46:44,525 --> 00:46:46,561
Don's a little tight.
Most people drink a little.

617
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:48,646
A lot of them get tight
once in a while.

618
00:46:48,746 --> 00:46:51,148
Sure, the lucky ones,
who can take it or leave it.

619
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:54,819
But then there are the ones who can't
take it and can't leave it either.

620
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:57,405
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm not a drinker.

621
00:46:57,505 --> 00:47:00,283
I'm a drunk.
They had to put me away once.

622
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:03,015
- He went to a cure.
- Which didn't take.

623
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:05,663
You see, that first time we met,
I should've had the decency...

624
00:47:05,763 --> 00:47:07,665
to get drunk
just for your sake.

625
00:47:07,765 --> 00:47:10,856
For my sake?
We're talking about you.

626
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:14,046
- Is it really that bad?
- Yes, it is.

627
00:47:14,146 --> 00:47:16,528
Can't we go over this tomorrow
when you're feeling more like yourself?

628
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:20,094
Helen's heard the facts.
That's all there is to it.

629
00:47:20,194 --> 00:47:22,701
Yes, I've heard them,
and they're not too pleasant.

630
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:25,975
They could be worse. After all,
you're not an embezzler or a murderer.

631
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:27,977
You drink too much,
and that's not fatal.

632
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:30,021
One cure didn't take.
There are others.

633
00:47:30,121 --> 00:47:33,232
- Of course there are.
- This has a familiar ring.

634
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:35,255
But there must be a reason
why you drink.

635
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:38,404
- The right doctor could find it.
- I'm way ahead of the right doctor.

636
00:47:38,504 --> 00:47:41,887
I know the reason.
The reason is me, what I am.

637
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:45,703
Or rather, what I'm not...
what I wanted to become and didn't.

638
00:47:45,803 --> 00:47:48,423
What is it you wanna be so much
that you're not?

639
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,933
A writer.

640
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:54,053
Silly, isn't it?

641
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,674
In college, I passed for a genius.

642
00:47:58,774 --> 00:48:02,011
They couldn't get out the college
magazine without one of my stories.

643
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:05,515
Boy, was I hot.
Hemingway stuff.

644
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:08,100
I reached my peak when I was 19.

645
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,396
<i>Sold a piece to the Atlantic Monthly,
reprinted in the Reader's Digest.</i>

646
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:16,088
Who wants to stay in college
when he's Hemingway?

647
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:18,632
My mother bought me
a brand-new typewriter.

648
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,905
I moved right in on New York.

649
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:24,575
Well, the first thing I wrote,
that didn't quite come off.

650
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:28,433
And the second, I dropped.
The public wasn't ready for that one.

651
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,958
I started a third and a forth.

652
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:36,796
Only by then, somebody began
to look over my shoulder and whisper...

653
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:41,446
in a thin, clear voice
like the E string on a violin.

654
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:44,512
"Don Birnam," he'd whisper.

655
00:48:44,612 --> 00:48:48,149
"It's not good enough,
not that way.

656
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:52,820
How about a couple of drinks,
just to set it on its feet?"

657
00:48:54,072 --> 00:48:57,650
So I had a couple.
What a great idea that was.

658
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,632
That made all the difference.
Suddenly, I could see the whole thing.

659
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:05,074
The tragic sweep of the great novel,
beautifully proportioned.

660
00:49:05,174 --> 00:49:08,015
But before I could really grab it
and throw it down on paper...

661
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:10,246
the drinks would wear off
and everything would be gone...

662
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:12,290
like a mirage.

663
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,814
Then there was despair.
I'd drink to counterbalance despair.

664
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,638
And then one to counterbalance
the counterbalance.

665
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:22,758
I'd sit in front of that typewriter,
trying to squeeze out...

666
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:25,103
one page that was halfway decent.

667
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:28,639
And that guy would pop up again.

668
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:30,641
What guy?
Who are you talking about?

669
00:49:30,741 --> 00:49:33,978
The other Don Birnam.
There are two of us, you know...

670
00:49:34,078 --> 00:49:37,023
Don the Drunk
and Don the Writer.

671
00:49:37,123 --> 00:49:39,066
The drunk would say to the writer...

672
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:42,361
"Come on, you idiot. Let's get
some good out of that portable.

673
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:46,220
Let's hock it. Let's take it
to that pawn shop on 3rd Avenue.

674
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,409
It's always good for ten dollars.

675
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:53,247
Another drink, another binge,
another bender, another spree."

676
00:49:53,347 --> 00:49:55,521
Such humorous words.

677
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:58,920
I've tried to break away
from that guy a lot of times...

678
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,139
but to no good.

679
00:50:01,973 --> 00:50:05,718
You know, once I even got myself
a gun and some bullets.

680
00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:08,771
I was gonna do it
on my 30th birthday.

681
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:14,206
Here are the bullets. The gun
went for three quarts of whiskey.

682
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:16,979
The other Don wanted us
to have a drink first.

683
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:20,566
He always wants us
to have a drink first.

684
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,985
The flop suicide
of a flop writer.

685
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:25,488
All right, maybe you're not a writer.
Why don't you do something else?

686
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:27,740
Sure, take a nice job.

687
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,576
Public accountant,
real estate salesman.

688
00:50:30,676 --> 00:50:32,599
I haven't the guts.

689
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:35,248
Most men lead lives
of quiet desperation.

690
00:50:35,348 --> 00:50:37,917
- I can't take quiet desperation!
- But you are a writer.

691
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:41,504
You have every quality for it...
imagination, wit, pity.

692
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:43,569
Come on.
Let's face reality.

693
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:46,425
I'm 33. I'm living
on the charity of my brother.

694
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:48,949
Room and board free...

695
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,847
fifty cents a week for cigarettes...

696
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,474
an occasional ticket
to a show or a concert.

697
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:55,977
All out of
the bigness of his heart.

698
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:58,062
And it is a big heart
and a patient one.

699
00:50:58,162 --> 00:50:59,918
I've only been
carrying you along for...

700
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:02,254
Shut up!
I've never done anything.

701
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:04,861
I'm not doing anything.
I never will do anything!

702
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,196
- Zero, zero, zero.
- Now you shut up.

703
00:51:07,296 --> 00:51:09,824
- We'll straighten it out.
- Look.

704
00:51:09,924 --> 00:51:12,201
Wick has the misfortune
of being my brother.

705
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,266
You just happened
to walk in on this.

706
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:17,311
If you know what's good for you,
turn around and walk out.

707
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:20,051
And walk fast,
and don't turn back.

708
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,478
Why don't you make some coffee?
Strong, three cups.

709
00:51:28,578 --> 00:51:32,190
Look, do yourself a favor.
Go on. Clear out.

710
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,881
Because I've got a rival?
Because you're in love with this?

711
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:39,948
You don't know me.
I'm gonna fight and fight and fight.

712
00:51:40,048 --> 00:51:41,083
Bend down.

713
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,092
All right.

714
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,676
That was three years ago.

715
00:51:59,776 --> 00:52:02,345
That's a long time
to keep fighting, to keep believing.

716
00:52:02,445 --> 00:52:05,682
She knows she's clutching a razor blade,
but she won't let go.

717
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:08,810
- Three years of it.
- And what?

718
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:12,022
- How's it come out?
- I haven't figured that far.

719
00:52:12,122 --> 00:52:14,462
Want me to tell you?

720
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:17,777
One day, a guy gets wise to himself,
he gets back that gun.

721
00:52:17,877 --> 00:52:21,698
If he's only got $1 .10, he goes
to the top of the Empire State Building.

722
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:23,575
And then...

723
00:52:23,675 --> 00:52:26,265
Or you can do it for a nickel
in the subway under a train.

724
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:28,246
You think so?

725
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:31,207
What if Helen's right, and this guy
sits down and turns out something good?

726
00:52:31,307 --> 00:52:33,209
And that pulls him up
and snaps him out of it.

727
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:35,545
This guy?
Not from where I sit.

728
00:52:35,645 --> 00:52:39,215
Oh, shut up! I wanna do it now!
It's all there. You heard it.

729
00:52:39,315 --> 00:52:42,177
- Yes, Mr. Birnam.
- That's why I didn't go away.

730
00:52:42,277 --> 00:52:44,617
I can be all alone up there
and sit down at my typewriter.

731
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,786
This time, I'm gonna do it!

732
00:52:46,886 --> 00:52:49,100
- Maybe you will.
- Thank you.

733
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,791
- Am I all paid up?
- Yes, Mr. Birnam.

734
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:53,647
Good-bye. I'm going home.

735
00:52:53,747 --> 00:52:55,949
This time, I've got it.
I'm gonna write!

736
00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:00,829
Good luck to you.

737
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,160
You had another bottle.
You know you did.

738
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,838
Where did you put it?
You're not crazy. Where did you put it?

739
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,295
<i>It was so beautiful, so wonderful</i>

740
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,214
<i>The stars above us shone</i>

741
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,849
<i>We were alone</i>

742
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,312
- Check, please.
- Right here, sir.

743
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:30,162
- Yes, sir?
- Another gin vermouth, please.

744
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,672
Yes, sir.

745
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,451
Thank you.

746
00:57:43,952 --> 00:57:46,789
- Where is your washroom?
- Over there, sir.

747
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,039
How's about a carnation
for your buttonhole?

748
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,591
No, thank you.

749
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:00,773
Thank you, sir.

750
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:02,275
- Wash your hands?
- Thank you.

751
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,056
All righty, sir.

752
00:58:06,671 --> 00:58:08,992
- Would you wipe my shoes?
- Yes, sir.

753
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,783
- Carnation, sir?
- I already took one.

754
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:35,120
- You did?
- For a very kind lady.

755
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,797
Yes, sir.

756
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:41,343
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

757
00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:06,943
- That's him! That's the man!
- You were sitting here, sir?

758
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,995
I beg your pardon?

759
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:16,211
You took this lady's bag,
didn't you? Let's have it.

760
00:59:18,296 --> 00:59:20,498
- Of course.
- Somebody call a cop!

761
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,980
No, George. It doesn't matter
as long as I have the bag.

762
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,441
Look in it.
Maybe he took something.

763
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:28,715
- Ten dollars, to be exact.
- I oughta kick your teeth in.

764
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,217
- He's drunk.
- Come on. Get out of here.

765
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,304
- How about the check?
- That's why I borrowed from the lady.

766
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,140
I didn't have enough.
I'll come back and pay the rest.

767
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,609
Don't you show your face
in here again ever! Mike!

768
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:43,396
<i>- Take him out of here.
- Somebody stole a purse</i>

769
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,440
Everybody!

770
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,160
I assure you, I'm not a thief!
I'm not a thief!

771
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,079
Stop it, Helen.
Stop it.

772
01:02:39,414 --> 01:02:41,917
I'm all right.
I just can't talk.

773
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:45,587
Please stop it!

774
01:03:53,613 --> 01:03:55,649
You'll never make it.

775
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,994
You'll never make that hock shop.
It's a block and a half away.

776
01:04:50,545 --> 01:04:52,852
- This isn't Sunday, is it?
- Huh?

777
01:04:52,952 --> 01:04:55,646
- I asked, "Is this Sunday?"
- No. Saturday. Why?

778
01:04:55,746 --> 01:04:58,211
But it's closed.
Nothing else is closed.

779
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,555
Somebody passed away,
most likely.

780
01:06:56,150 --> 01:07:00,145
- What's the matter with you?
- Why are they all closed?

781
01:07:00,245 --> 01:07:02,272
They're all closed,
every one of 'em.

782
01:07:02,372 --> 01:07:04,858
- Sure they are. It's Yom Kippur.
- It's what?

783
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:07,986
- It's Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday.
- It is?

784
01:07:08,086 --> 01:07:10,197
And what about Kelly's
and Gallagher's?

785
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:12,616
They're closed too.
We've got an agreement.

786
01:07:12,716 --> 01:07:15,753
They keep closed on Yom Kippur,
and we don't open on St. Patrick's.

787
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:20,799
That's a good joke.
That's funny. That's very funny.

788
01:08:00,005 --> 01:08:01,799
Yeah, Mr. Birnam?

789
01:08:02,883 --> 01:08:04,844
What do you want?

790
01:08:08,514 --> 01:08:12,885
Let me have one, Nat.
I'm dying.Just one.

791
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:15,345
I thought you was home
writing that book.

792
01:08:15,445 --> 01:08:20,601
They're playing a trick on me,
a dirty trick, Nat. Give me one.

793
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:23,854
I'll pay you when I can,
only just don't let me die here.

794
01:08:23,954 --> 01:08:26,106
No credit,
and you know it.

795
01:08:26,206 --> 01:08:29,493
All right. It's charity.
I'm begging you. Give me one.

796
01:08:30,536 --> 01:08:32,279
Yeah. One.

797
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:34,702
One's too many,
and a hundred's not enough.

798
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:47,831
That's all.

799
01:08:49,054 --> 01:08:53,042
Come on, Nat.
I'll let you have my typewriter.

800
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:55,561
I'm no writer.
You're the writer.

801
01:08:56,683 --> 01:08:58,201
- Please.
- Go. Go away.

802
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:01,066
- Please.
- I mean it. Get out of here.

803
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,185
Who is it?

804
01:10:03,438 --> 01:10:04,898
It's me.

805
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,811
Mr. Don Birnam,
as I live and breathe.

806
01:10:09,911 --> 01:10:12,522
Only, if you're coming for our date,
you're a little late, aren't you?

807
01:10:12,622 --> 01:10:16,442
If you're coming to apologize,
no, thanks. Thanks, but no, thanks.

808
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:20,217
Save your saliva. I've had enough
of you. Deaf, but deaf.

809
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:22,720
What do you think I am?
I break a business date.

810
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,368
I buy me an evening purse,
a facial, a new hairdo.

811
01:10:25,468 --> 01:10:27,537
You can do that to your ritzy
friends, but you can't to me.

812
01:10:27,637 --> 01:10:29,455
- Understand?
- Gloria.

813
01:10:29,555 --> 01:10:33,810
Okay, what do you want,
Mr. Don Birnam, Esquire?

814
01:10:34,386 --> 01:10:36,525
I need some money.

815
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:39,424
- You what?
- Could you let me have some money?

816
01:10:40,113 --> 01:10:43,084
Say, you out of your mind?
Don't be "ridic."

817
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:45,730
Get out of here.
Make with those stairs. Go on.

818
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:59,119
I waited half the night, like
it was the first date I ever had.

819
01:11:00,662 --> 01:11:02,956
The other half I was crying.

820
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:10,830
- How much money?
- Could you let me have ten or five?

821
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:12,465
I'll see.

822
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:28,014
You look awfully sick, Mr. Birnam.
Have you got a fever or something?

823
01:11:28,114 --> 01:11:30,025
I'm all right now.

824
01:11:31,484 --> 01:11:35,021
Thank you a lot.
You do like me a little, don't you?

825
01:11:35,121 --> 01:11:37,198
Why, natch, Gloria.
Natch.

826
01:11:39,701 --> 01:11:41,819
Gloria,
who have you got out there?

827
01:11:41,919 --> 01:11:43,319
Coming.

828
01:11:44,539 --> 01:11:47,025
<i>It's a hap-hap-happy day</i>

829
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,053
What's this place?

830
01:12:52,095 --> 01:12:55,390
Hey, what is this place?

831
01:12:56,266 --> 01:12:58,727
I'm talking to you.

832
01:13:02,022 --> 01:13:04,933
Good morning, Merry Sunshine.
How's your head?

833
01:13:05,033 --> 01:13:07,018
Where am I?
What is this place?

834
01:13:07,118 --> 01:13:09,020
This? This is Hangover Plaza.

835
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,481
- What hospital is this?
- Alcoholic ward.

836
01:13:11,581 --> 01:13:13,650
- How's your head?
- It aches.

837
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,819
Thought you had a fracture
till we looked at the X rays.

838
01:13:15,919 --> 01:13:18,697
Everything in one piece.
just a slight concussion.

839
01:13:18,797 --> 01:13:20,615
Why'd they put me
in the alcoholic ward?

840
01:13:20,715 --> 01:13:23,493
Are you kidding? We got a peek
at your blood. Straight applejack.

841
01:13:23,593 --> 01:13:25,057
96 proof.

842
01:13:25,157 --> 01:13:27,789
- What day is it?
- Sunday. Are these yours?

843
01:13:27,889 --> 01:13:30,229
You and the colored fellow
were being undressed at the same time.

844
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:34,296
- They fell out of somebody's pants.
- They're mine. You a doctor?

845
01:13:34,396 --> 01:13:38,216
I'm a nurse, name of Nolan.
They call me Bim.

846
01:13:38,316 --> 01:13:42,554
- Call me Bim. What's your name?
- Birnam.

847
01:13:42,654 --> 01:13:45,223
- What kind of Birnam?
- Don Birnam.

848
01:13:45,323 --> 01:13:48,623
- Where do you live?
- 209 East Vir...

849
01:13:48,723 --> 01:13:51,980
- What do you need that for?
- For the postcard.

850
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,961
- What postcard?
- To your folks, so they know...

851
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:57,194
where honey boy is and can pick
him up when he's feeling better.

852
01:13:57,294 --> 01:13:59,112
No address.

853
01:13:59,212 --> 01:14:03,200
We'll get it out of the phone book
or the directory or your wallet.

854
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,827
Look. No postcard,
understand?

855
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:09,310
- Nobody's gonna pick me up.
- The management insists.

856
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:12,000
If we let you guys go home alone,
a lot of you don't go home.

857
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,086
You just hit the nearest bar
and bounce right back again...

858
01:14:15,186 --> 01:14:17,464
what we call the "quick ricochet."

859
01:14:17,564 --> 01:14:20,383
I'm as well as you are.
I can get out of here right now.

860
01:14:20,483 --> 01:14:22,114
- Think so?
- Where are my clothes?

861
01:14:22,214 --> 01:14:24,763
- Downstairs.
- How do I get out?

862
01:14:24,863 --> 01:14:26,773
Right through there.

863
01:14:41,788 --> 01:14:44,908
- Where do you think you're going?
- To get my clothes.

864
01:14:45,008 --> 01:14:47,640
- Got your discharge?
- My what?

865
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,631
- Your release.
- I'm all right. Let me out.

866
01:14:51,798 --> 01:14:54,843
- Get back there. Go on.
- Keep your hands off me!

867
01:14:59,848 --> 01:15:01,767
Come here, Birnam.

868
01:15:03,393 --> 01:15:08,327
- Is this a jail?
- Halfway hospital, halfway jail.

869
01:15:08,427 --> 01:15:10,642
Listen, Bim. In my clothes,
there's five dollars.

870
01:15:10,742 --> 01:15:13,478
That's all for you, if only
you won't send that postcard.

871
01:15:13,578 --> 01:15:15,939
- Nothing doing.
- I don't want anybody to know.

872
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:18,233
Your folks might as well
get used to our little postcards.

873
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:20,735
- What are you talking about?
- There'll be more of 'em.

874
01:15:20,835 --> 01:15:23,038
- You'll be back.
- Oh, shut up!

875
01:15:24,623 --> 01:15:27,158
Listen. I can pick an alkie
with one eye shut.

876
01:15:27,258 --> 01:15:30,871
You're an alkie.
You'll come back. They all do.

877
01:15:30,971 --> 01:15:35,021
Him, for instance. Shows up
every month, just like the gas bill.

878
01:15:35,121 --> 01:15:39,296
And the one with the glasses.
Another repeater. His 45th trip.

879
01:15:39,396 --> 01:15:41,527
Big executive
in the advertising business.

880
01:15:41,627 --> 01:15:45,364
Lovely fellow.
Been coming here since 1927.

881
01:15:45,464 --> 01:15:49,306
Good old Prohibition days.
You should've seen the joint then.

882
01:15:49,406 --> 01:15:52,392
This is nothing. Back then,
we really had a turnover.

883
01:15:52,492 --> 01:15:54,186
Standing room only.

884
01:15:54,286 --> 01:15:57,522
Prohibition: That's what
started most of these guys off.

885
01:15:57,622 --> 01:15:59,816
Now, be a good boy
and drink this.

886
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:02,319
- I don't want it.
- Better take it.

887
01:16:02,419 --> 01:16:04,863
Liable to be a little floor show
later on around here.

888
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:07,720
- Might get on your nerves.
- Floor show?

889
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,784
- Ever have the D.T.'s?
- No.

890
01:16:09,884 --> 01:16:11,786
- You will, brother.
- Not me.

891
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:14,956
Like to make a little bet?
After all, you're just a freshman.

892
01:16:15,056 --> 01:16:18,543
Wait till you're a sophomore. That's
when you start seeing animals.

893
01:16:18,643 --> 01:16:21,943
You know that stuff
about pink elephants? That's bunk.

894
01:16:22,043 --> 01:16:26,176
It's little animals,
little turkeys in straw hats.

895
01:16:26,276 --> 01:16:29,554
Midget monkeys
coming through the keyholes.

896
01:16:29,654 --> 01:16:33,350
See that guy over there?
With him, it's beetles.

897
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:36,570
Come the night, he sees beetles
crawling all over him.

898
01:16:37,654 --> 01:16:39,585
Has to be dark, though.

899
01:16:39,685 --> 01:16:42,359
It's like the doctor
was just telling me:

900
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:45,203
Delirium is a disease
of the night.

901
01:16:46,288 --> 01:16:47,873
Good night.

902
01:17:51,603 --> 01:17:53,397
Get the restraints and the doctor!

903
01:18:25,387 --> 01:18:27,472
Get him up
to the violent ward.

904
01:18:30,976 --> 01:18:32,728
Over here, Doctor.

905
01:18:54,124 --> 01:18:56,209
Violent ward.
Get the elevator.

906
01:20:57,122 --> 01:20:59,041
- Good morning.
- Shh.

907
01:21:03,712 --> 01:21:07,674
Anything wrong up there?
Anything wrong?

908
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:12,940
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, thank you.

909
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,882
- Have you been there all night?
- I've been waiting for Mr. Birnam.

910
01:21:16,982 --> 01:21:18,946
I suppose he stayed overnight
with friends.

911
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:23,013
- He has friends in Long Island.
- What kind of story's that?

912
01:21:23,113 --> 01:21:25,453
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm his landlady.

913
01:21:25,553 --> 01:21:28,226
I know what goes on in this house.
I know Mr. Don Birnam.

914
01:21:28,326 --> 01:21:32,064
I knew all about him the first week
they moved here five years ago.

915
01:21:32,164 --> 01:21:34,357
Heard those bottles
rattle in the garbage can.

916
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:37,277
I know all about you.
You're Helen St.James.

917
01:21:37,377 --> 01:21:40,405
<i>You're working on Time magazine,
and you're his best girl.</i>

918
01:21:40,505 --> 01:21:44,201
I also know he's not staying
with any friends in Long Island.

919
01:21:44,301 --> 01:21:46,953
He's off on another toot,
and you know I'm darned right.

920
01:21:47,053 --> 01:21:48,955
Now, come on down,
and I'll make you some breakfast.

921
01:21:49,055 --> 01:21:53,460
I don't care for breakfast nor that
talk, even supposing you're right.

922
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,505
Which I am. I could've
kicked him out 50 times...

923
01:21:56,605 --> 01:21:59,257
the last when two taxi drivers
dumped him into the entrance hall...

924
01:21:59,357 --> 01:22:02,719
out cold on the floor with
all my tenants going in and out...

925
01:22:02,819 --> 01:22:04,304
and children leaving
for school!

926
01:22:04,404 --> 01:22:06,515
- Please!
- Well, I didn't put him out...

927
01:22:06,615 --> 01:22:08,600
not as long as his brother
could pay the rent.

928
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,103
You couldn't help liking him anyway,
he was so good looking.

929
01:22:11,203 --> 01:22:14,213
He had such nice manners.
He always had a little joke.

930
01:22:14,395 --> 01:22:16,325
Stop talking about him
as if he were dead.

931
01:22:17,877 --> 01:22:19,786
Best thing for you
if he was!

932
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:21,643
Quarter rye, quick.

933
01:23:21,743 --> 01:23:23,737
- Okay if I take off my coat?
- No!

934
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:29,701
No cracks. No questions.
just a quarter rye.

935
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,186
- Be 2.15.
- Come on. I need that liquor.

936
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:46,084
I want it, and I'm going to get it,
understand?

937
01:23:46,184 --> 01:23:49,943
I'm going to walk out with that
quarter rye, one way or another.

938
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:26,636
Miss St.James?
He's back. He's upstairs.

939
01:26:26,736 --> 01:26:30,265
This is Mrs. Deveridge.
Yes, he's back up in his apartment.

940
01:26:30,365 --> 01:26:31,942
I heard him yelling.

941
01:26:44,788 --> 01:26:46,707
Open the door. Please.

942
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:52,462
Don, won't you let me in? I know
you're there. Please open the door.

943
01:26:55,007 --> 01:26:57,300
Don, don't you hear me?
I want to help you.

944
01:26:59,428 --> 01:27:01,901
Don, I won't go away.
Do I have to go down...

945
01:27:02,001 --> 01:27:04,307
and get the janitor
with the passkey to let me in?

946
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:10,563
Dave?

947
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,392
- Yes, Mrs. Deveridge?
- Come on up with the passkey.

948
01:27:14,492 --> 01:27:15,944
Come on.

949
01:28:08,538 --> 01:28:10,469
- Thank you very much.
- You'd better let us come too.

950
01:28:10,569 --> 01:28:13,931
- You can't go in there alone.
- I'll be all right. Thank you.

951
01:28:14,031 --> 01:28:16,088
Come, Sophie. Let's go.

952
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,424
- Don, darling.
- Go away, Helen.

953
01:28:27,524 --> 01:28:30,560
- I'm here to help you, darling.
- No, no.

954
01:28:31,812 --> 01:28:36,983
Look at you. You want to get up,
Don. Put your arm on my shoulder.

955
01:28:52,499 --> 01:28:54,868
You'll have a bath,
and I'll help you shave...

956
01:28:54,968 --> 01:28:56,953
and you'll eat and sleep...

957
01:28:57,053 --> 01:29:00,248
and when Wick comes back,
everything'll be all right.

958
01:29:00,348 --> 01:29:02,083
No! Don't!

959
01:29:02,183 --> 01:29:04,878
- What's the matter?
- That wall.

960
01:29:04,978 --> 01:29:07,672
- What wall?
- The mouse and the bat.

961
01:29:07,772 --> 01:29:11,226
- "The mouse and the bat"?
- That hole in the wall behind you.

962
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:16,723
- There's no hole in the wall.
- Yes, there is.

963
01:29:16,823 --> 01:29:21,645
There isn't. Don,
please look for yourself. Come on.

964
01:29:21,745 --> 01:29:23,864
Come on, Don. Please look.

965
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:38,085
See?

966
01:29:42,924 --> 01:29:45,231
Everything's going to be all right.
I'll stay right with you.

967
01:29:45,331 --> 01:29:50,807
It's little animals,
always little animals, Bim said.

968
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:54,532
You're not
making much sense, Don.

969
01:29:54,632 --> 01:29:57,105
You know what Nat
said about the ending?

970
01:29:58,482 --> 01:30:00,538
Like this...

971
01:30:00,638 --> 01:30:03,040
or like that.

972
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:06,124
Like this or like that.

973
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,627
Where are you going,
Don? Don?

974
01:31:06,064 --> 01:31:08,391
- Give me the pawn ticket.
- No scene, please.

975
01:31:08,491 --> 01:31:10,101
just give me the ticket.

976
01:31:10,201 --> 01:31:12,499
I don't want you to go in and
claim it now. It would look queer.

977
01:31:12,599 --> 01:31:14,459
You're ashamed of what
the pawnbroker thinks, is that it?

978
01:31:14,559 --> 01:31:16,962
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- Wick'll get you back your coat.

979
01:31:17,062 --> 01:31:20,486
You couldn't have taken my bracelet
or my paycheck? It had to be that!

980
01:31:20,586 --> 01:31:23,698
The one that brought us together?
Stop being sentimental.

981
01:31:23,798 --> 01:31:26,951
I have, Don. I assure you.
It's finished. It's dead.

982
01:31:27,051 --> 01:31:28,869
For three years,
they couldn't talk me out of you.

983
01:31:28,969 --> 01:31:30,976
I was the only one
that really understood you.

984
01:31:31,076 --> 01:31:33,666
I knew there was a core
of something. Well, there is.

985
01:31:33,766 --> 01:31:36,210
And now I know
what it is: a sponge.

986
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:39,463
To soak it full, you'll do anything
that's ruthless, selfish, dishonest.

987
01:31:39,563 --> 01:31:41,674
- I asked you not to make a scene.
- Then give me the ticket.

988
01:31:41,774 --> 01:31:43,759
- Not now. Please.
- I don't want the money!

989
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:46,145
You can get as drunk as you like
for all I care!

990
01:31:47,146 --> 01:31:48,731
Thank you.

991
01:32:00,034 --> 01:32:02,737
A gentleman came in a while ago.
How much did you give him for that?

992
01:32:02,837 --> 01:32:04,864
- Why?
- I want it back. It's my coat.

993
01:32:04,964 --> 01:32:06,678
- It's your coat?
- It's all right. He had permission.

994
01:32:06,778 --> 01:32:08,743
- How much did you give him?
- He didn't want any money.

995
01:32:08,843 --> 01:32:11,183
- He wanted to swap it.
- Swap it? For what?

996
01:32:11,283 --> 01:32:13,581
Something he hocked here
a long while back.

997
01:32:13,681 --> 01:32:15,675
- What?
- A gun.

998
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,900
A gun.

999
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:24,331
Now, if you want the coat back,
I can...

1000
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:27,311
What is it, Helen?

1001
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:31,773
What's the matter?

1002
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:35,736
Nothing.

1003
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:38,864
Dave gave me the keys.
I didn't think you were here.

1004
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:46,488
- What do you want here?
- I couldn't get a taxi.

1005
01:33:46,588 --> 01:33:50,388
I thought I could borrow a coat
under the circumstances.

1006
01:33:50,488 --> 01:33:52,961
Sure. How about my raincoat?

1007
01:33:58,926 --> 01:34:02,295
Funny that we should wind up after
all these years just as we met.

1008
01:34:02,395 --> 01:34:05,015
- I with your raincoat.
- And I with your leopard coat.

1009
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:08,635
I always get the best
of the bargain.

1010
01:34:08,735 --> 01:34:10,312
Good-bye, Helen.

1011
01:34:13,023 --> 01:34:15,851
- What are you looking for?
- I thought perhaps...

1012
01:34:15,951 --> 01:34:18,061
maybe you might
have something for my hair.

1013
01:34:18,161 --> 01:34:21,898
- Would you care to wear my derby?
- Any old thing. Any old scarf.

1014
01:34:21,998 --> 01:34:23,408
All right.

1015
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,043
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1016
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:43,554
So long.

1017
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:48,133
There was some whiskey left
in the bottle after I cleaned up.

1018
01:34:48,233 --> 01:34:51,949
- Was there?
- Like to know where I put it?

1019
01:34:52,049 --> 01:34:54,273
- Don't you want a drink, Don?
- No.

1020
01:34:57,693 --> 01:35:02,189
Here it is. Right here.
Why don't you have one? Just one.

1021
01:35:02,289 --> 01:35:05,463
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

1022
01:35:05,563 --> 01:35:07,402
I'm just ashamed of the way
I talked to you...

1023
01:35:07,502 --> 01:35:10,864
like a narrow-minded, insensitive
small-town teetotaler.

1024
01:35:10,964 --> 01:35:12,908
I told you I don't feel
like a drink. Not now.

1025
01:35:13,008 --> 01:35:15,368
Come on, Don.Just one.
I'll have one with you.

1026
01:35:15,468 --> 01:35:17,537
I'm in no hurry.
This is my easy day at the office.

1027
01:35:17,637 --> 01:35:20,916
Helen, there are a few things I want
to put in order before Wick comes.

1028
01:35:21,016 --> 01:35:23,510
Let me stay. Please.

1029
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:29,725
I don't want to sound rude,
but I'm afraid you'll have to leave.

1030
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:34,980
- Here, Don.
- You're very sweet.

1031
01:35:37,566 --> 01:35:39,026
Good-bye.

1032
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:44,064
- Don't let me bend for nothing.
- You need this, Don. Drink it.

1033
01:35:44,164 --> 01:35:47,567
I want you to drink it. I'll get you
more. I'll get you all you want.

1034
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:52,414
- What kind of talk is that?
- I'd rather you be drunk than dead.

1035
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:58,045
- Who wants to be dead?
- Stop lying to me.

1036
01:36:01,485 --> 01:36:03,032
Give it to me!

1037
01:36:08,597 --> 01:36:10,549
All right. Now, go.
No fuss, please.

1038
01:36:10,649 --> 01:36:13,030
And don't call the neighbors.
It won't do any good, I promise.

1039
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:15,679
I won't.
You've made up your mind.

1040
01:36:15,779 --> 01:36:17,681
But could you tell me why? Why?

1041
01:36:17,781 --> 01:36:20,142
'Cause it's best for everybody:
for you, Wick and for me.

1042
01:36:20,242 --> 01:36:25,105
- That's not true. We love you.
- Then for me. Selfish again.

1043
01:36:25,205 --> 01:36:27,607
- That's a sad final word, Don.
- Look at it this way:

1044
01:36:27,707 --> 01:36:30,360
This business is a formality.
Don Birnam is dead already.

1045
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:33,447
- He died over this weekend.
- Did he? What did he die of?

1046
01:36:33,547 --> 01:36:36,575
A lot of things. Of alcohol.
Of moral anemia.

1047
01:36:36,675 --> 01:36:41,392
- Of fear, shame, D.T.'s!
- Oh, that Don Birnam!

1048
01:36:41,492 --> 01:36:43,582
- And now you want to kill the other?
- What other?

1049
01:36:43,682 --> 01:36:46,677
There were two Dons. You told me:
Don the drunk and Don the writer.

1050
01:36:47,344 --> 01:36:51,923
Let's not go back to a fancy figure
of speech. There's only one Don.

1051
01:36:52,023 --> 01:36:54,050
He's through.

1052
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:56,470
I'm all right.
I still have enough strength left.

1053
01:36:56,570 --> 01:37:00,182
I know you have. I can see it.
Don't waste it by pulling a trigger.

1054
01:37:00,282 --> 01:37:03,894
Let me get it over. You want me to
give another promise I can't keep?

1055
01:37:03,994 --> 01:37:06,250
I don't want your promise. I don't
want you to give your promise...

1056
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:07,898
to anybody but Don Birnam.

1057
01:37:07,998 --> 01:37:10,108
It's too late!
I wouldn't know how to start!

1058
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:14,425
The only way to start is to stop.
There is no cure besides stopping.

1059
01:37:14,525 --> 01:37:16,615
- Can't be done.
- Other people have stopped.

1060
01:37:16,715 --> 01:37:18,825
People with a purpose,
with something to do!

1061
01:37:18,925 --> 01:37:21,745
- But you've got talent and ambition!
- Talent! Ambition!

1062
01:37:21,845 --> 01:37:24,081
That's dead long ago.
That's drowned.

1063
01:37:24,181 --> 01:37:27,042
That's drifting around with a
bloated belly in a lake of alcohol.

1064
01:37:27,142 --> 01:37:29,086
No, it isn't.
You still have it.

1065
01:37:29,186 --> 01:37:31,171
Quit trying to stall me, Helen.
It's too late.

1066
01:37:31,271 --> 01:37:33,840
There's no more writing left in me.
What do you expect? A miracle?

1067
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:37,302
Yes! If I could
just make you un...

1068
01:37:37,402 --> 01:37:39,179
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mr. Birnam.

1069
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:43,108
- What is it, Nat?
- I got something for you.

1070
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:48,043
- I hope I ain't intrudin'.
- What is it?

1071
01:37:48,752 --> 01:37:51,538
You know when you had that accident?
Afterward, I found this floating...

1072
01:37:51,638 --> 01:37:53,290
around on the Nile.

1073
01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:55,230
She writes good.
I oiled her up a little.

1074
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:58,095
And I didn't oil her up
so you can hock her.

1075
01:37:59,847 --> 01:38:02,016
- I'll take it, Nat.
- Hello, miss.

1076
01:38:03,767 --> 01:38:07,229
- Thank you, Nat.
- How are them lilacs in Ohio?

1077
01:38:10,733 --> 01:38:13,081
Well, Don, here it is.
What do you say now?

1078
01:38:13,181 --> 01:38:15,124
- Say about what?
- This.

1079
01:38:15,224 --> 01:38:17,981
Someone somewhere sent it back. Why?
Because he means you to stay alive.

1080
01:38:18,081 --> 01:38:20,964
Because he wants you to write.
I didn't ask for a big miracle.

1081
01:38:21,064 --> 01:38:23,591
Write with these hands
and a brain all out of focus?

1082
01:38:23,691 --> 01:38:25,239
It'll clear up again.

1083
01:38:25,339 --> 01:38:27,929
And I'll be sitting there staring
at that white sheet, scared.

1084
01:38:28,029 --> 01:38:30,828
No, you won't. You've forgotten
what it feels like to be well.

1085
01:38:30,928 --> 01:38:34,456
- What am I going to write about?
- What you've always wanted.

1086
01:38:34,556 --> 01:38:39,440
<i>- Where was the page I found?
- The Bottle. A novel by Don Birnam.</i>

1087
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,755
- What was that to be?
- About a messed-up life.

1088
01:38:41,855 --> 01:38:43,757
About a man and a woman
and a bottle.

1089
01:38:43,857 --> 01:38:45,947
About nightmares, horrors,
humiliations...

1090
01:38:46,047 --> 01:38:47,761
all the things
I want to forget.

1091
01:38:47,861 --> 01:38:49,888
Put it all down on paper.
Get rid of it that way.

1092
01:38:49,988 --> 01:38:51,932
Tell it all:
"To whom it may concern."

1093
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:55,444
- And it concerns so many.
- Yeah.

1094
01:38:56,528 --> 01:38:58,781
I'll fix us some breakfast.

1095
01:39:00,324 --> 01:39:02,242
We have quite a supply
of milk.

1096
01:39:04,787 --> 01:39:07,990
You'll notice
I didn't even find the first line.

1097
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:11,118
You couldn't write the beginning
because you didn't know the ending.

1098
01:39:11,218 --> 01:39:13,128
Only, now...

1099
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,418
Only, now you know the ending.

1100
01:39:34,463 --> 01:39:36,540
I'm going to send one copy
to Bim...

1101
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,625
one to the doctor
who loaned me his coat...

1102
01:39:38,725 --> 01:39:41,169
and one to Nat.

1103
01:39:41,269 --> 01:39:44,068
Imagine Wick
standing in front of a bookstore.

1104
01:39:44,168 --> 01:39:49,011
Great, big pyramid of books,
and a novel by Don Birnam.

1105
01:39:49,111 --> 01:39:51,847
- "That's by my brother, you know."
- "That's by my fellow.

1106
01:39:51,947 --> 01:39:56,643
- Didn't I always tell you?"
- I'm gonna put this weekend down.

1107
01:39:56,743 --> 01:40:01,148
- Why not?
- The way I stood in there, packing.

1108
01:40:01,248 --> 01:40:03,734
Only, my mind wasn't
on the suitcase.

1109
01:40:03,834 --> 01:40:05,944
It wasn't on the weekend.

1110
01:40:06,044 --> 01:40:08,997
<i>Nor was it on the shirts I was
putting in the suitcase, either.</i>

1111
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:13,097
<i>My mind was hanging
outside the window.</i>

1112
01:40:13,197 --> 01:40:16,422
<i>It was suspended
just about 18 inches below.</i>

1113
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,792
<i>And out there in that
great, big concrete jungle...</i>

1114
01:40:20,892 --> 01:40:23,920
<i>I wonder how many others
there are like me...</i>

1115
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:27,945
<i>poor, bedeviled guys
on fire with thirst...</i>

1116
01:40:28,045 --> 01:40:30,114
<i>such comical figures
to the rest of the world...</i>

1117
01:40:30,214 --> 01:40:33,159
<i>as they stagger blindly
towards another binge...</i>

1118
01:40:33,259 --> 01:40:35,998
<i>another bender,
another spree.</i>

1119
01:40:36,305 --> 01:41:36,400
