1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,059
Okay. Say, Jones and Barry
are doing a show.

3
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,478
That's great!
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

4
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,104
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

5
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,774
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

6
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,693
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

7
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,112
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

8
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:56,657
- Jones and Barry are doing a show.
- Testing, testing.

9
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,534
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

10
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,203
You're telling me?

11
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:04,040
Well, of course, I'm not a lawyer.

12
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,917
I'm in the Kiddie Kar business.

13
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,211
I don't know much about contracts...

14
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,048
but it looks good to me.

15
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,761
It's the biggest contract I ever signed.

16
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,387
Thanks to you, Mr. Dillon.

17
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,266
Aw, you could have your choice
of a dozen shows.

18
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,310
A pretty girl like you.

19
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,813
Not with this depression.

20
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,148
If not for you and your Kiddie Kars...

21
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,484
Oh, now, Miss Brock...

22
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,361
Dorothy, I mean.

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,322
You don't mind
my calling you Dorothy, do you?

24
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,825
Why, of course not.

25
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,495
Well, Dorothy,
I'd like to do something for you.

26
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,206
You've done entirely
too much for me already...

27
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,750
and I just can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.

28
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,752
No, no. I mean...

29
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,631
I mean, I'd like
to do something for you...

30
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,259
if you'd do something for me.

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,058
Why, Mr. Dillon, of course
I'd be very glad to...

32
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,436
but what could I possibly do
for a big man like you?

33
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,605
Call me Abner.

34
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,164
When we got Dorothy Brock,
we got a great break.

35
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,959
Abner Dillon guarantees
to finance anything she does.

36
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,963
These days, stars like Dorothy Brock
are a dime a dozen.

37
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,590
That's what we got you for.

38
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:40,511
Julian Marsh, the greatest musical
comedy director in America today.

39
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,513
What do you mean, today?

40
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,098
All right, tomorrow too.

41
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,642
Say, with your reputation...

42
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,604
Did you ever try to cash
a reputation at a bank?

43
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,564
I'm in this for one reason only:

44
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,815
Money.

45
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,692
Money? You?

46
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,778
With all your hits,
you ought to be worth plenty.

47
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,780
I ought to be, but I'm not.

48
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,616
Did you ever hear of Wall Street?

49
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,038
Excuse me, Mr. Marsh, there's
a phone call for you. A Dr. Chadwick.

50
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,832
- I'll call him back.
- He says it's urgent.

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,001
About your examination.

52
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,631
Use our private phone, Julian.

53
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,260
What is it, doc?

54
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,263
You have?

55
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,390
Good Lord, you're not a machine!

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,935
That body of yours
will stand just so much.

57
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,270
There's no other way.

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,566
You're not just headed
for another nervous breakdown.

59
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,819
Any undue strain on your part
might easily prove fatal.

60
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,489
Sorry, doc, but I've got to risk it.

61
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,740
Anything wrong?

62
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,118
- You won't have another breakdown?
- The contract's signed.

63
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,996
- That doesn't matter.
- That's all right. It holds.

64
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,042
You'll get your Pretty Lady.

65
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,212
You haven't got anything
to worry about.

66
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,297
I'm not gonna let you down...

67
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,384
because I can't afford to.

68
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,971
I've given everything I've had
to that gulch down there.

69
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,974
It paid me, sure,
in money I couldn't hang on to...

70
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,810
fair-weather friends, women, headlines.

71
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,647
Why, even the cops and the newsboys
recognize me on sight.

72
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,400
"Marsh the Magnificent."
"Marsh the Slave Driver."

73
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,278
Actors tell you how Marsh
drove them, bullied them...

74
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,946
and tore it out of them.

75
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,864
A few would tell you
how Marsh made them.

76
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,117
They've all got something to show,
except Marsh.

77
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,619
Well, this is my last shot.

78
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,748
I'll make more actors, but this time
I'll sock my money away so hard...

79
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,501
they'll have to blast
to find enough to buy a newspaper.

80
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,004
That's why I'm going ahead
with Pretty Lady.

81
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,588
Pretty Lady has to be a hit.

82
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,966
It's my last show,
and it's got to be my best.

83
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,719
You're counting on me.
I'm counting on Pretty Lady...

84
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,763
because it's got to support me
for a long time.

85
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,140
- Wait!
- Remember...

86
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,185
my contract makes me boss with
a capital B. What I say, goes.

87
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,856
Now, make the chorus call
for 10:00 tomorrow.

88
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,736
He'll drive us crazy
before we get this show on.

89
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,406
Yeah, but suppose that guy
should pass out on us?

90
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,784
New York will see
its first triple funeral.

91
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,219
Good morning.
Mr. Marsh will be here soon.

92
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,180
Quiet now. Quiet, please!

93
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,058
Quiet, everybody, quiet!
Hello, Jerry. How are you?

94
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,392
Hello, Andy.

95
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,062
It's too good to be true.
How's the turnout, Mac?

96
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,857
About 50-50. Half are dumb
and the other half are dumber.

97
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,903
Andy! Hello.

98
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,784
He's so busy.

99
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,454
- Lorraine has been hitting the bottle.
- The peroxide bottle.

100
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,917
You wanna get me canned?
You're set, you're in. Now scram.

101
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,546
Darling, you're just too sweet,
the way you keep spoiling me.

102
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:03,839
I beg your pardon.

103
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,175
It's okay. This is a two-way street.

104
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:10,221
I beg your pardon.
But are you, by any chance, the?

105
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,514
What is the word?

106
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,307
The stage manager?

107
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,685
Hey, Ann, come out from
under that accent. I see you.

108
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,687
Lolly!

109
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,939
Darling.

110
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,733
You remember Ann Lowell?

111
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,403
Not Anytime Annie?
Who could forget her?

112
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,155
She only said no once,
when she didn't hear the question.

113
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,865
You been abroad?

114
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,913
Andy?

115
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,373
Where's Andy Lee?

116
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,208
Yes, Mr. Marsh. Coming right up.

117
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,129
- Good morning, Mr. Marsh.
- Good morning.

118
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,713
- Line them up.
- Yes, sir.

119
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,133
Okay, girls, line up. Come on.

120
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,968
Quiet, now. Quiet!

121
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,095
Come on, now. Quiet, girls.

122
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,307
I want all the dancers to line up
and double-lined out front.

123
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:59,645
Showgirls can double-line in back
of them and the boys in back of them.

124
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,941
Don't spread out!
Come on, girls, hurry up.

125
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,987
I really had a charming summer
in Deauville, dear.

126
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:12,700
Yes, but don't you find Sir George
impossible at times?

127
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,161
Get a load of "Minnie the Mountaineer."

128
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,414
It must have been tough on your
mother, not having any children.

129
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,957
That's telling them.

130
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,629
Oh, dear.

131
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,016
You looking for somebody,
or just shopping around?

132
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,643
Where will I find
the gentleman in charge?

133
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,188
First door to your left, dearie.

134
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,448
I know, but...

135
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,277
- He's expecting you.
- But that's the...

136
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,783
Our mistake. The other door.

137
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,247
- Oh.
- Hey, wait a minute.

138
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,082
Hey, what's the idea?

139
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,293
Oh... They said...

140
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,794
Weren't you expecting me?

141
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,798
Well, not exactly,
but I'm afraid you'll do.

142
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,343
Well, I don't understand.

143
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,012
I don't either.
What are you looking for?

144
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,722
Well, isn't this the...?

145
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,683
Wait till I get my clothes on.
I'll show you where it is.

146
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,061
It isn't an "it," it's a "he."

147
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,314
Maybe I'm wrong about the whole thing.
Let's start over again.

148
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,317
I'm Billy Lawler,
one of Broadway's better juveniles.

149
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,819
Oh. I thought you were important.

150
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,781
That's the way most people
feel about juveniles.

151
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,659
Only most of them
aren't so frank about it.

152
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,623
- You're new to show business?
- Oh, I've had experience.

153
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,125
- How many shows?
- Why, any number of them.

154
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,878
- Come on, now.
- To tell you the truth...

155
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,088
I want the truth.

156
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,590
This'll be my first, if they take me.

157
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,885
If they take you? Say, you can't miss.

158
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,387
I'll take you in myself.

159
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,556
I'll steer you right up
to the stage director.

160
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,349
Come on, let's go.

161
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,980
A short order of ham, coming out.

162
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,983
Not good, but loud.
Honey, take a good look at them now.

163
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,319
Because after they make that back line,
you won't see them again.

164
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:17,116
If it isn't Little Lord Fauntleroy
and the village maiden.

165
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,618
Just a minute.
Where are you headed, sister?

166
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,122
- She wants to see Marsh.
- That'll make Marsh's day perfect.

167
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,665
Come on, girls, inside.

168
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,376
There's the boss right there.
His name is Julian Marsh.

169
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,797
He's the fellow with the light green
felt hat. Go over and talk to him.

170
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,265
Quit shoving.

171
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,608
Lift the skirts up a little higher.
Come on, come on.

172
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,943
Afraid I got a run.

173
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,196
- First door to your left.
- In my stocking.

174
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,532
First offense?

175
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,201
Yes, but I don't think
I ought to tell them that.

176
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,705
No, of course not.
And they'll never guess.

177
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,624
Do you think I'll do?

178
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,169
I only know what I read in the papers,
but you look all right to me.

179
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,921
- Andy! Get the first eight girls.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,341
Will the first eight girls line up here?

181
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:19,053
The first eight girls line up
down in front. Come on.

182
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,681
Now lift your dresses up.

183
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,559
Come on, higher. I want to see the legs.

184
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:31,190
Yeah, they got pretty faces too.

185
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,068
Turn around. Come on, turn around!

186
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,781
Oh, dear, not a calf in a carload.

187
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,075
- Get the next eight.
- Next eight, come on.

188
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,620
Stick with us,
and you'll come in on the tide.

189
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,747
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Line up, girls.

190
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,584
Hurry up, girls. Lift your dresses up.

191
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,129
- Do you mind holding Fifi for me?
- Turn around now, please.

192
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,882
All right, back.

193
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,803
Three!

194
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,392
Okay those three on the left.
If I were you, I'd keep them.

195
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,311
I suppose if I don't, you'll have to.

196
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,106
Lorraine again?

197
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,234
Andy, you're a panic.
All right, have it your way.

198
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,779
Mac, okay by special request
of the copyright owner.

199
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,491
- All right, next eight. Hurry up.
- Next eight girls.

200
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,119
What's yours?

201
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,456
Diane Lorrimer. 333 Park Avenue.

202
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,875
And is her homework tough!

203
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,669
Next.

204
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,255
- Adams!
- Here.

205
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,507
- Kipling!
- Here.

206
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,926
- Andy.
- What's the matter?

207
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,722
Well, what is it, what is it?
What's the matter now?

208
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,267
Must have been a slip-up someplace.
We're a girl short.

209
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,603
Well, that's great. Just great!

210
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,441
We also need a dance director who can
count to 40 without a pad and pencil.

211
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,277
- Mr. Marsh...
- Well, do something! Get another girl.

212
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,446
Are you gonna stand there
and shake a blond out your pantlegs?

213
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,739
Yeah, but Mr. Marsh...

214
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,324
- I don't want to butt in...
- A lot of people are like that.

215
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:08,495
- I'll have one here in the morning.
- That's ducky. I can hardly wait.

216
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,791
Mr. Marsh, you don't have to wait.
And she's a swell dancer too.

217
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,170
You picked her, but she got
eliminated the third time through.

218
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,549
- Come out from behind there.
- You, with the legs! Come out of there.

219
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,302
Quiet! Quiet, please!

220
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,764
- Quiet, please!
- Quiet, please!

221
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,686
Well, I'm a... Hey, kid! Hey, you!

222
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,813
Hey, come on, get up.

223
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,235
- The boss wants to see you again.
- Who? Me?

224
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,070
Come on, come on.

225
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,369
All right, she'll do.
They're all yours, Andy.

226
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,372
All right, get in line.

227
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,754
All right, now, everybody.
Quiet, and listen to me.

228
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,508
Tomorrow morning,
we're gonna start a show.

229
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,637
We'll rehearse for five weeks,
and we'll open on scheduled time...

230
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,514
and I mean, scheduled time.

231
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,141
You'll work and sweat
and work some more.

232
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,976
You'll work days and nights...

233
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,355
and you'll work between time,
when I think you need it.

234
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,859
You'll dance until your feet fall off
and you can't stand up...

235
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,655
but five weeks from now,
we're going to have a show.

236
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,575
Some of you have been with me before.
You know it'll be tough.

237
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,120
It'll be the toughest five weeks
that you ever lived through.

238
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,914
Do you all get that?

239
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,544
Anybody who doesn't think he'll like it,
better quit right now.

240
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,128
What do I hear?

241
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,047
Nobody?

242
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,675
Good. Then that's settled.

243
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,177
We start tomorrow morning.

244
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,015
All right, 10:00 tomorrow morning,
we start with the lyrics.

245
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,475
In practice clothes.

246
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,219
What did I tell him?
This is what I told him:

247
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,806
"No, I won't run your stage
for that money."

248
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,767
Great. You beat Jerry
to the finish by two lengths.

249
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,521
All right, take your positions.
We'll try those routines again.

250
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,985
Quiet! Where do you
think you are, home?

251
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,572
I get back to New York
and I get this wire.

252
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,199
Come on, kids, make it snappy.

253
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,202
All right, Jerry, let's go!

254
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,459
Dorothy, that's your cue.

255
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,753
Things can never be the same now.

256
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,088
I beg your pardon,
but would you mind saying:

257
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,883
"Things can never be the same now"?

258
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,927
- That's what I said.
- You did not.

259
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,929
You said, "Things can
never be the same now."

260
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,138
- I did not.
- You did.

261
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,642
- Who's directing this show?
- She's reading my lines wrong.

262
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,226
- I am not.
- What did you say?

263
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,646
I said, "Things can
never be the same now."

264
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,147
That's right.

265
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,274
Things can never be the same now.

266
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,361
The scene ends with you on the steps,
and you go into the number.

267
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,613
That's where you take his hand.

268
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,450
The scene ends with you two
on the steps, and we go into the duet.

269
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,499
- Hello.
- Hi.

270
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,919
- You're doing fine for a beginner.
- Well, thanks. I'm trying.

271
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:48,090
I was so scared that first day,
I walked around the block four times...

272
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,468
before I had the courage to even
come and apply for this job.

273
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,136
It's tough, but you'll get along.

274
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,473
Well, I wouldn't mind, if I could
only get that routine set.

275
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,017
I'll show you those taps.
Come on with me.

276
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,268
Taps?

277
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,188
Say, I can do a tap dance on my ear.

278
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,482
What bothers me is that routine.

279
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,652
Then I'm just what
the doctor ordered. Come along.

280
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,365
Now, look.

281
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,825
Cross over.

282
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,289
You're gluttons for punishment.

283
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,917
Well, Mr...
Well, this boy's showing me.

284
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,795
- I was trying to make her...
- Trying to make her is right.

285
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,175
We'll just let that pass.
Now try it again.

286
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,080
- Where you sitting?
- On a flagpole, dearie. On a flagpole.

287
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,552
I always said she was a nice girl.
She's so good to her mother.

288
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,598
She sure is. She makes $45 a week
and sends her mother 100 of it.

289
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,492
Get some feeling into it, will you?

290
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,328
What do you want me to do,
bite my nails?

291
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,547
You've got the busiest hands.

292
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,650
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

293
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,151
It's out.

294
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,487
That'll be enough of that. It smells.

295
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,114
You don't like this number?

296
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,075
Sure, I like it.
I've liked it since 1905.

297
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,910
You think this is a revival?

298
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,288
- It's out. The whole number!
- This number will be a riot.

299
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,333
That's what I'm afraid of.
Dismiss. An hour for lunch.

300
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,128
All right, everybody.
One hour for lunch.

301
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,619
Waiting long, darling?

302
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,746
Well, long enough.

303
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,957
My, but we're grouchy, aren't we?

304
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,793
- Oh, no, not that, but...
- What?

305
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,671
I'm getting tired of
this hiding in doorways...

306
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,799
sneaking in and out of places
and keeping under cover.

307
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,302
Why, I'm beginning
to feel like a criminal.

308
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,848
There's nothing criminal
in that, is there?

309
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,517
No, there's nothing criminal in that.

310
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,485
I thought we'd better tell you,
it looks like we're in trouble.

311
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,279
That word has a familiar sound.

312
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,281
Are you married too?

313
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,949
This is serious, Julian.

314
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,785
Serious? Did you ever
leave your wife...

315
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,164
sitting alone in a nightclub,
holding the check?

316
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,375
You know Abner Dillon's
putting up the bankroll for our show.

317
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,920
I knew he wasn't here
because you liked his face.

318
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,631
I don't like his face
or any part of him.

319
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:02,552
He looks like a Bulgarian boll weevil
mourning its first-born.

320
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,222
Well, his interest in our show
is Dorothy Brock.

321
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,724
And his interest is our principal.

322
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,435
Very good. Very, very good.

323
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,687
Even I was able to gather that much.

324
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,941
Yes? Well, we stand a first-rate
chance of having him...

325
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,569
withdraw his financial support.
Now, did you gather that?

326
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,862
But why?

327
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,532
Because dear Miss Brock is two-timing
Abner right under his very nose.

328
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,992
Who with?

329
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,870
With a fellow who used
to be her partner in vaudeville.

330
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,206
She's come up in the business,
he hangs around.

331
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,792
He's been out of town
and just got back last week.

332
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,545
If Dillon finds out... And if he doesn't,
he's dumber than I thought...

333
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:41,216
Well, now, wait.
Nobody could be as dumb as all that.

334
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,761
He'll just walk out on us
and we'll be sunk, that's what...

335
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,638
if we don't do something.

336
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,556
Tried applying dough to the problem?

337
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,476
Give the Romeo 100 bucks.
Get him out of the way.

338
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,354
We might try using a little flint.

339
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,899
You don't know this guy Denning.
That's his name. Pat Denning.

340
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,486
He's not the kind of guy that
gets sent places just like that.

341
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,530
Oh, no, he gets train-sick.

342
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,324
Oh, I see. Hard-boiled?

343
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,577
Well, it's going to be just too bad...

344
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,206
- ...but nobody's gonna ruin my show.
- What'll you do?

345
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,710
I'll talk it over with Murphy,
a friend of mine from downtown.

346
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,919
- Slim Murphy?
- Yeah.

347
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,421
Murphy will kill him.

348
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,589
That'll teach him a good lesson.

349
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,384
I don't want to be mixed up
with Murphy or any other gangsters.

350
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,304
No? One man's meat
is another man's Murphy.

351
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,597
I told you what this show means to me.

352
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,599
Well, this is what it does mean.

353
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,060
Hello, Murphy? This is Julian Marsh.

354
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,521
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Listen to me.

355
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,858
You gotta do me a favor.
Did you ever hear of Dorothy Brock?

356
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,278
Good, that makes it so much easier.

357
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,238
Well, listen to me and get this.

358
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,742
It seems there's a certain guy
by the name of Denning.

359
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,828
D-E-N...

360
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,623
N-I-N-G.

361
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,668
I got you, Mr. Marsh. Sure.

362
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,922
Hey, pipe down!
What do you think I got on, earphones?

363
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,176
It's as good as done.

364
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,347
Say, you ain't gonna forget me
on ducats for the new show, are you?

365
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,350
Thattaboy! Okay.

366
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:25,153
Not another nickel, honey.
Just can't be done anymore, that's all.

367
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,822
Pat, don't be silly.

368
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,658
We've always shared
and shared alike, haven't we?

369
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,160
What's come over you?

370
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,996
Getting a sudden attack
of manhood, possibly.

371
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:39,125
Let's quit kidding ourselves.
I'm a regular anchor around your neck.

372
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,377
- You're not.
- I am.

373
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,670
Besides, never being able to see you...

374
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,590
except when nobody's looking
is getting me down.

375
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,052
But, darling,
I owe everything I am to you.

376
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,263
It was you and that act of ours
that started me in all this.

377
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:56,101
Why, you trained me and coached me
and taught me all I know.

378
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,019
I was pretty dumb too.

379
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,938
- I haven't forgotten.
- The act?

380
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,107
It was grand, Pat. Really grand.

381
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,442
- It was terrible.
- You didn't think so then.

382
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,321
You mean I didn't say so then.
Oh, Dot, you've gone ahead.

383
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,991
You've earned it. I've stayed
behind where I belong, I guess.

384
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,701
You've kept yourself behind.

385
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,414
Nothing of the sort. They wanted you.
They never wanted me.

386
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,627
Besides, I've been getting myself
some education...

387
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,755
and they have a name
for a man who doesn't work...

388
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,258
who accepts money from a woman.

389
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,760
It isn't a very nice name.

390
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,305
- Darling, you're talking like a child.
- No, I'm not.

391
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,808
- There isn't any other reason, is there?
- No.

392
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,477
- Sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

393
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,188
It's late. I'll take you home.
Keep the change.

394
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,982
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

395
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,361
- I wish you didn't feel that way.
- So do I, but I do.

396
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,081
Watch your tempo! Watch it, will you?

397
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,167
Get your feet off the floor.

398
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,256
Faster, faster!

399
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,717
Come on, faster! Faster!

400
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,512
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

401
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,139
It's brutal!

402
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,600
Oh!

403
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:23,480
May I remind you that Pretty Lady's
out-of-town opening is not far away?

404
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:27,775
It's been advertised as
a musical comedy with dancing!

405
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,280
If it isn't asking too much,
will you please show me a little?

406
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,866
All right, once again.
Give it something!

407
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,203
Come on. Ready, Jerry?
Get into it now. Come on!

408
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,266
Having fun?

409
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,394
After three weeks,
a leg ain't nothing to me...

410
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,522
but something to stand on.

411
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,024
Let me hear your number, Dorothy.

412
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,027
Come on, Jerry. The "Habit" number.

413
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,448
Jerry, put it up a half tone, will you?

414
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,501
Doesn't she sing gorgeous?

415
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,254
Seventy thousand bucks.

416
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,486
Watch this, honey.
I may want you to understudy her.

417
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,427
All right, okay.

418
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,597
Come on, folks, get ready for
the duet number. Start up.

419
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,142
Okay, Jerry, let's go.

420
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,897
Come on, faster!

421
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,753
Faster, Jerry, faster!

422
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,881
What's the matter with you?

423
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,885
- You all right, kid?
- I guess so.

424
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,721
Come on, faster. Faster!

425
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,309
Peggy!

426
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,521
- Stand back! Get back in line.
- She's fainted.

427
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,691
Come on now, places.
This is a rehearsal, not a rest cue.

428
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,903
Mac, take her outside. Hurry up.
Come on, everybody.

429
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,198
All right, come on, get back.
Jerry, let's go.

430
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,204
Come on, pick it up!

431
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,833
- Here, sir.
- Thank you.

432
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,215
- Hold your places!
- Lawler, inside.

433
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,677
- The girl's okay.
- You feel better, honey?

434
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,899
I guess I fainted.

435
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,651
That's a good guess.

436
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,195
Well, I guess I'm all right now.

437
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,203
Woo. Bad guess. Better sit down
again. Now listen, you let me play now.

438
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,330
What would you suggest, doctor?

439
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,666
A little fresh air and conversation.

440
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,334
What about Mr. Marsh?

441
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,838
Never mind Mr. Marsh.
Let's sit this dance out.

442
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,381
And if I lose my job?

443
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,718
If you do, there just
won't be any show.

444
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,553
Anyway, it's a nice idea.

445
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:27,974
I've got a lot of nice ideas.
What I need are ears to spill them in.

446
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,893
Well, won't mine do?

447
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,439
Yes, you know, I think
they'd do very, very nicely.

448
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,315
When are your ears available?

449
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:40,486
At all sorts of odd hours.
You must look them up sometime.

450
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,447
Remind me to tell you you're swell.

451
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:46,701
- That's all for tonight.
- All right, dismissed, girls.

452
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,293
Well, thanks, doctor.
Your prescription was great.

453
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,920
Now for the workshop.

454
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,592
You gotta take it daily
to really do any good.

455
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,094
It'll have to be
absent treatment, I'm afraid.

456
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,346
At least for the time being.

457
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,932
- Good night.
- Bye.

458
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,353
- Good night, Jimmy.
- Good night.

459
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,606
Coming, Abner?

460
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,694
Dorothy, where will we eat?

461
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,572
You know, Abner, I'm not a bit hungry.

462
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,533
- But I'm all dressed for dinner.
- Oh, yes, so you are.

463
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,368
I'll get the car.

464
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:35,124
- Dorothy, the car's here.
- Yes, Abner.

465
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,523
Why, doctor, you must like it here.

466
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,359
I'm beginning to.
I'm not the doctor anymore, you are.

467
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,737
I've become the patient,
and I'd like a little advice.

468
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,365
Very well, but you might tell
the doctor your name.

469
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:11,035
I couldn't do that,
but my initials are Pat Denning.

470
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:15,122
What do you advise for a man
who's both hungry and lonesome?

471
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,666
- Company.
- Excellent.

472
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,501
Did you have anyone in mind?

473
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,419
- Did you?
- Will you?

474
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:24,257
- I'm very much afraid I will.
- Good.

475
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,177
Good night, Pat.
It was a wonderful evening.

476
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,929
- I'll see you again?
- I hope so.

477
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,889
- Good.
- Good night.

478
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,226
Hey, got a match?

479
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,144
Yep. I guess so.

480
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,022
Happen to know a guy named Pat Denning?

481
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,233
- Why, yes.
- We've got a message for him.

482
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,862
This guy Denning's a pretty wise mug,
but he ain't wise enough.

483
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:49,240
If he don't lay off Dorothy Brock,
it'll be just too bad...

484
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,075
for Denning. Get me?

485
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,994
- I'll tell him.
- Yeah, well...

486
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,328
Oh!

487
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,291
- That's so you don't forget.
- Pat! Pat!

488
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,128
Pat. Who were they?

489
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,672
- Friends with good advice.
- Are you hurt?

490
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,507
Not much.

491
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,428
But, Pat, tell me what happened.

492
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,221
Better let it drop.

493
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,058
Besides, it's hardly a bedtime
story for a nice girl like you.

494
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,645
What do you think this is?
Get that man out of here!

495
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,689
- But, Mrs. Holt...
- But nothing!

496
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:22,940
I have eyes.

497
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,028
Just because there's a depression on,
some folks think I'll stand for it.

498
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,362
But you don't know.

499
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:32,783
After running a rooming house for 19
years, there's nothing I don't know.

500
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,328
Now you get out, and no more talk!

501
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,121
Then if he goes, I go too!

502
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:40,583
Probably I'll be able to bear
up under that blow too.

503
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,503
Well...

504
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,589
where do we go from here?

505
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,759
- Hotel?
- I suppose so.

506
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,221
But it'll have to be inexpensive,
as I only have a dollar and a half.

507
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,226
- What about my place?
- Broke?

508
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,146
Not exactly. Not exactly flush either.

509
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,733
Then I guess it's your place
or a park bench.

510
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,829
Here you are.

511
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,050
That's better.

512
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,719
Hand me your coat.

513
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,692
Make yourself comfortable.

514
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,945
Will you excuse me a minute?

515
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,560
Rose-colored glasses.
Let's see how the world looks.

516
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,187
- Okay, doctor.
- Here we go.

517
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,448
- Things beginning to look any better?
- A little bit.

518
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,493
- Tired, aren't you?
- Dead tired.

519
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,422
And I feel just like beginning.

520
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,925
You hop, step and jump
as many miles as I have today...

521
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:58,220
and you'd be tired too.

522
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,867
Pat. Pat, what are you doing?
Please put me down!

523
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:23,287
Please, Pat. Please put me down.

524
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,709
Now you go right to sleep, youngster.

525
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,253
What you need is a good night's rest.

526
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,714
Good night.

527
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,013
- Oh, Pat.
- Yes?

528
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,390
Will you hand me my bag, please?

529
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,185
- Oh, which one?
- That one.

530
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,067
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

531
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,861
- Good night.
- Good night.

532
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,801
What do you do when you've
got left feet like mine?

533
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,182
- Just pick them up and lay them down.
- I'm doing the best I can.

534
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,521
Get a load of the juvenile.

535
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,191
Didn't know we had
elephants in the show.

536
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,612
Wait a minute, hold it!

537
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:40,823
Hold it, Jerry!

538
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:47,746
Some director's gonna jail you for
taking money under false pretenses.

539
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,582
You're supposed to be a dancer!

540
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,626
You just need license plates
to look like a Model T Ford.

541
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,795
They've been going all night long...

542
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:58,632
I'll keep them here if it takes a week!
All right, get out!

543
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,135
- Take the last eight bars.
- Pick it up, Jerry.

544
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,553
Pick it up, Jerry.

545
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,490
- Hello, honey.
- Oh, Dot, how are you?

546
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,593
Oh, tea for two.

547
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:29,163
Yeah. Friend of mine dropped in.

548
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,215
Love me?

549
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,919
I wonder.

550
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,880
You're not going to get
serious on me, are you?

551
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,553
- You leaving town?
- Yeah.

552
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,388
Stock job in...

553
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,015
Philadelphia.

554
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,601
Oh, Pat, without telling me?

555
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,187
Well, I thought it was the best way.

556
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:56,941
Maybe you're right.

557
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,403
Sit down, dear. I want to talk to you.

558
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,328
I've done a lot of thinking
since the other night.

559
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,499
Pat, you know what's wrong
with me, or rather, with us?

560
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,085
We've grown too necessary
to one another.

561
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:20,047
You've been content in the shadows
while I basked in the spotlight...

562
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,383
simply because it's held us together.

563
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,678
- My success has been your failure.
- Well, dear...

564
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,430
my failure, as you put it,
has been my happiness.

565
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,309
But, darling, you're capable
of such great things.

566
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,061
You're not a quitter.

567
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,356
I've only wanted to help,
but I've been hurting you instead.

568
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,316
I realize that now.

569
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,027
That's why I came here this morning.

570
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,654
Pat.

571
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,573
We're not going to see
each other for a long time.

572
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,575
No more doorways.

573
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,911
No more secret meetings.

574
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,747
You're going out on your own
and make a success.

575
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,210
You're right, Dot. But you know...

576
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,922
somehow, I can't imagine
going on without you.

577
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,341
Nor I without you...

578
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,260
but it's got to be.

579
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,888
Yes, Dot. It's got to be.

580
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,267
And maybe, someday...

581
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,020
someplace?

582
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,521
Maybe.

583
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,026
Bye, Pat.

584
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,405
Oh, Dot...

585
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,911
I love you.

586
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,913
Me too.

587
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,063
Up!

588
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,898
Up.

589
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,068
Up. Up.

590
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,236
Up.

591
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,324
- How are you, Bluebeard?
- Okay, just a touch of scarlet fever.

592
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,411
Oh, that's fine. Maybe it'll
develop into something serious.

593
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,504
The curtain's just come down!

594
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,005
It's the end!

595
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,674
Is this what you call a finale?

596
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,847
What is this? Amateur night?

597
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:39,728
Have we been rehearsing for
five weeks, or did I dream it?

598
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,021
The show's ragged!

599
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,025
- What do you mean, the show's ragged?
- The numbers are ragged!

600
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,404
May I remind all you
shining lights that...

601
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:52,324
this is the company
that opens tomorrow night?

602
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,661
I am in the right theater, am I not?

603
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:59,123
This is the Pretty Lady company,
isn't it?

604
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,875
The all-star show that...

605
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,461
opens in Philadelphia tomorrow night?

606
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,047
- Philadelphia?
- Quiet.

607
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:08,715
Quiet!

608
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,969
Philadelphia, PA.

609
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,431
Yeah, and on Sundays, it's P-U.

610
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,182
- Quiet!
- Quiet!

611
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,143
Julian...

612
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,937
- ...you mean Atlantic City, don't you?
- I mean Philadelphia.

613
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,232
Train leaves at 1 p.m., Penn Station.

614
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,693
Full dress rehearsal, 4:00.
Arch Street Theater.

615
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,696
But I don't want to go to Philadelphia.

616
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,533
Who does? We couldn't get
the house at Atlantic City.

617
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,702
But why Philadelphia?

618
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,413
Well, when you become stage director...

619
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,333
we'll open in your apartment.
But right now, it's Philadelphia.

620
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,422
Of all the cities in the United States,
he would pick Philadelphia.

621
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,424
All right now, listen to me.

622
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,553
We open at the Arch Street
Theater tomorrow night.

623
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,976
So this is Philadelphia!

624
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,069
Why don't you stop that?!

625
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,155
Peggy.

626
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,741
- Getting a kick out of it?
- Of course, you?

627
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,495
I don't know. Do you suppose
anybody'll even know I'm in the show?

628
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:20,746
I will.

629
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,956
Does it make any difference to you?

630
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,251
Gee, Billy. I've been for you
since that first day.

631
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,170
Places, everybody.

632
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:29,796
- I'll be seeing you.
- Okay.

633
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,800
You won't forget the modulation
on the last eight bars.

634
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,512
- You forgot your handkerchief.
- Go ahead.

635
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,681
Call those timers, hold them.

636
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,420
- nice to the right people,
you'll get along.

637
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,922
When you walk downstage...

638
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,384
just give it a little life.
You know, sort of...

639
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,011
Quiet! Please!

640
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,228
Well, it's...

641
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,814
not good, it's not bad.

642
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,274
That's all for tonight.

643
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,443
- Wait.
- Hold it!

644
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,112
Come back here, girls.

645
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,448
I want you all to take
your minds off the show.

646
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,492
Get out and relax.

647
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,412
Forget it till 10:00 tomorrow morning.

648
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,499
I don't know. I think it'll do.

649
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,960
But I want you to come back tomorrow...

650
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:59,423
to give the best performance
that you ever gave in your lives.

651
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,174
Company dismissed.

652
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,385
- Dismissed, girls.
- Company dismissed!

653
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,262
Go on out and have a good time.

654
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,724
You really was elegant, Miss Brock.

655
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,602
Pansy, did anyone telephone me?

656
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:13,895
Phone?

657
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,189
No, ma'am. Nobody at all.

658
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:20,193
- You're sure?
- I certainly is. Yes, ma'am, Miss Brock.

659
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:26,491
- Have a little supper with me?
- I would have.

660
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,662
- But you thought of it too late.
- I've been thinking of it all day.

661
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,166
Well, I'm not a mind reader.
I've got a date.

662
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:35,959
Billy.

663
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:38,712
- I'm free tomorrow night.
- Then it's a date.

664
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,922
- Okay.
- Don't forget, now.

665
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,385
I gotta get the stuff for the party.
Do you mind?

666
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,306
I'll see you at the hotel,
room 1061, and make it snappy!

667
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:54,227
She says for you to wait.
She'll be out in just a minute.

668
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:56,146
Oh.

669
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,485
Good night, Mr. Marsh.

670
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,617
I said, "What is it? A duck?"

671
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,077
Andy, you're terrible.
You know any more?

672
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,746
I've got a lot more...

673
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,664
Andy?

674
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,084
- Yes, sir?
- Go on, yes man. Papa give you liver.

675
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,212
Shut up. This may be important.

676
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:24,049
Oh, it can't be, darling.
He's calling you.

677
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,235
Hurry up!

678
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,033
Oh.

679
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,160
Sit down, Andy.

680
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,294
Anything wrong, chief?

681
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,882
Everything's wrong, Andy.

682
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:09,427
No, you're a great director, Mr. Marsh.

683
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,061
Maybe I was, but...

684
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,981
right now I'm a sick man.

685
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,110
They told me I was sick when
I started, but I started anyway.

686
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,864
Andy, I'm going to finish,
and I'm gonna have a show.

687
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,617
I know what they'll say.
They'll like it. They've got to.

688
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,913
"Marsh is a wizard.
He turns them out like clockwork.

689
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,291
The guy isn't human. He's a machine."

690
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,669
Well, I'm not a machine, Andy.

691
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:46,840
And for the first time, I'm counting
on someone else. I've got to.

692
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:51,720
I'm counting on you. And tomorrow
night, we're gonna give them a show.

693
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:55,265
The greatest show
Julian Marsh ever put on.

694
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,184
What are you doing? Got a date tonight?

695
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,728
No.

696
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,901
Come on home with me, will you?
I'm lonesome.

697
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,903
Sure.

698
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,740
Taxi.

699
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,492
Pat! What are you doing
in Philadelphia?

700
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,536
Got my passport and dropped over.

701
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,623
- Business or pleasure?
- I don't know yet, but it's a job.

702
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:24,210
Say, what about one of those cozy
midnight suppers one reads about?

703
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,379
I've been hoping you'd come out.

704
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,382
- Oh, dear, I have a date.
- Well, break it.

705
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,427
- I'd like to, but I can't.
- Well, you can try.

706
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:37,140
It's with the company and we open
tomorrow. I really should be on hand.

707
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,602
I understand. Let me drive
you to the main event.

708
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,937
All right.

709
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,229
Taxi.

710
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,362
Congress Hotel.

711
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,073
Forget something, Dorothy?

712
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,160
Oh, no.

713
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,539
Congress Hotel.

714
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,920
Oh, Abner. Isn't this car big
enough for two? Move over.

715
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,255
You ain't gonna have
another spell, are you?

716
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:12,717
I'm tired. Dress rehearsal is no picnic.

717
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,804
- A little party'll do you good.
- Yes.

718
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,973
Don't just being with me cheer you up?

719
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,350
Oh, tremendously.

720
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,520
I'm practically hysterical right now.

721
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,944
Oh, don't be afraid of me.
I got strength.

722
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,614
I used to be the intercollegiate
champion hop, skip and jumper.

723
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,283
- Come on now, hurry up.
- Here I come.

724
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,206
Give the little boy a big hand.

725
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,042
Right across your big mouth.

726
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,086
Please!

727
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,806
I tell you, I don't even know
my own strength. Wait a minute.

728
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,433
Just look here.

729
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,977
Oh, you're too, too divine.

730
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:10,525
Tomorrow you've got to give
a performance, not an exhibition.

731
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,738
Well, you'd never know it
from the manuscript.

732
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,698
I beg your pardon.

733
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,158
She's right.

734
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,785
- Let's dance.
- I don't want to.

735
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:23,538
- Come on, I wanna dance.
- Stop mauling me.

736
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,791
Let me alone.
You're not funny to me tonight.

737
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,002
- I've got half a mind...
- You're telling me.

738
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,171
Do you wanna cramp your act?

739
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,134
In a star, it's temperament,
but in a chorus girl, it's just bad taste.

740
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,512
What is this, target practice?
Why can't you let me alone?

741
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:43,224
Wisecracks, I'm sick of them!
I'm tired of you.

742
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,560
Tired of all of you, do you hear?

743
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,979
Why, Dorothy.

744
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,861
You know, you better hop on your
Kiddie Kar and go back to Cleveland.

745
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,322
Excuse me, it's the tight shoes.

746
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,990
Shut up!

747
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,910
- Where are you going?
- Maybe she needs me.

748
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:06,456
- Are you going to be a sucker for that?
- Sucker! You listen to me.

749
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:10,251
Seventy thousand dollars is a lot of
money to pay for a pack of insults.

750
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:13,505
So you've been calling me
a sucker behind my back?

751
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,965
Well, I ain't a sucker for anybody.

752
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,967
Dorothy don't mean that to me!

753
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,429
If not for me, she wouldn't
have had a show to star in.

754
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,265
She better not try to
give me the air now.

755
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,976
Now...

756
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,980
So that's it, is it?
You small-town big shot.

757
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:32,565
- Now don't start...
- Shut up!

758
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,818
So I better not give you the air?

759
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,612
Well, that's exactly what
I'm giving you right now.

760
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:41,116
Now get out of my room, you sucker!
Get out!

761
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,367
Try and make me!

762
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,702
- Don't do that again!
- Get out!

763
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,372
Get out!

764
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,419
No place for anybody
whose insurance ain't paid.

765
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,296
Wait for me.

766
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,634
And the next time you come to
a lady's apartment, act like a lady.

767
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,136
Please!

768
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,357
- Hello.
- We've located Mr. Denning for you.

769
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,152
Get him for me, will you?

770
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,409
Oh, now what?

771
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,121
Hello.

772
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:32,834
- Hello, Dorothy.
- Hello, Pat...

773
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,462
Pat, I can't stand it any longer.

774
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:39,257
I've gotta see you.

775
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,759
- Yes, but...
- Please don't ask me why.

776
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,928
Just come quickly, please.

777
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,264
All right, dear. I'll be right over.

778
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,791
Come in.

779
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,878
Sorry, Julian.

780
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,504
More trouble.

781
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,342
- What's up?
- Dorothy's out of the show.

782
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:25,637
Definitely, once and for all, she's out.

783
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,725
Well, let me have it. What happened?

784
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,437
She threw me out of her room.
That's what.

785
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:37,565
Now you want to throw her out.
What is this? A game?

786
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,984
- You can't do it.
- Oh, no?

787
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,570
Brock's in my show and that's final.

788
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,073
If Dorothy stays in...

789
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:49,827
this show don't open
tomorrow night. That's final.

790
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,996
Why, you potbellied sap.

791
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,206
I resent that.

792
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,334
You've sunk $70,000 already,
and you're gonna toss that away...

793
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,336
because of a dame?

794
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,296
That's my funeral, ain't it?

795
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:05,176
And the funeral of 200 other people:
chorus girls, boys, electricians.

796
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,720
You wouldn't be that mean, would you?

797
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,932
Well, I think she ought to apologize.

798
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,144
Why, of course she'll apologize.
She'll be sorry by morning.

799
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,773
I wish you wouldn't take it like this.

800
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:23,278
Back in New York, they're calling you
"The Angel of Broadway."

801
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:24,570
No.

802
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,531
- Sure.
- Are they?

803
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,533
Well...

804
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,787
I guess maybe I can overlook it,
if she apologizes.

805
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,753
But it must be tonight.

806
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,588
That's final.

807
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:54,309
What's the matter?
You don't seem to be warming up at all.

808
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,728
Oh, don't, Terry! Please!

809
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,522
Come on, this is no way to act.

810
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,317
You've got me wrong, Terry.
I'm not acting.

811
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,403
I just don't like to
be pawed, that's all.

812
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,239
Come here, honey.
Why, you don't know...

813
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,035
- Must have been a fuse.
- Yeah, a fuse named Charlie.

814
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,205
Peggy! Peggy!

815
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,047
Go get her, Terry!

816
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,925
Come on, let's have another drink.

817
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,808
- Going down?
- No, sir. Up.

818
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,859
Pat.

819
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:05,296
Pat.

820
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,760
If he cramps our show now...

821
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:15,264
We fixed him once before,
and we can do it again. Let's get Marsh.

822
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,455
- What?
- Mr. Denning. Is he here?

823
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,583
- You know he is. What do you want?
- Mr. Denning.

824
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,378
Can't leave him alone for
five minutes, can you?

825
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,797
Please, Miss Brock. This is important.

826
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,298
What's the matter?

827
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,301
Oh, Pat, there's going
to be trouble. I saw...

828
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:56,931
Oh! So it's "Pat" to him,
but it's "Mr. Denning" to me.

829
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,559
You bet there's gonna be trouble.

830
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,520
- Let's see what it's about.
- I know what it's about!

831
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:03,813
She's been spying on us.

832
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,774
- Spying? I wasn't spying...
- You were!

833
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:11,362
You were peeking through the keyhole.
You were, because I saw you.

834
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:12,905
She's jealous.

835
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,199
You want him, but you won't get him!

836
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,076
- Wait a minute.
- Wait for what?

837
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,412
More spying and double-crossing?

838
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,789
- Let me go! Let me...
- Wait a minute.

839
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:25,126
- Oh, Miss Brock!
- Dorothy...

840
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,713
You pushed me, didn't you?

841
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,924
Dorothy, what's the matter with you?

842
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,262
Oh, Pat.

843
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:37,847
- My ankle.
- What is it?

844
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,140
My ankle.

845
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,851
- Get the house doctor right away.
- All right.

846
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:48,232
Hello. Hello. Please send the house
doctor to Miss Brock's apartment.

847
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:50,568
Yes, thank you.

848
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,907
Get her shoes off, quick.

849
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:00,953
There, there, now.

850
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,663
Oh...

851
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,790
Pat, it's swelling.

852
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,880
- Answer the door, it's the doctor.
- All right.

853
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:17,220
- You sent for me?
- Yes, doctor. Right in there.

854
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,561
- Oh, doctor. It's her ankle.
- Which one?

855
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:29,857
- A glass of water, please.
- Yes, doctor.

856
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,159
- Is your name Denning?
- Yeah.

857
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,578
I want to talk to you. Where is she?

858
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,622
- She's had an accident.
- What?

859
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:48,084
She fell and twisted her ankle.
It may be a break.

860
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,169
What are you talking about?

861
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:53,673
How bad is it?

862
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,676
- Can't tell definitely.
- Maybe it's only a sprain.

863
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:00,179
Looks like a fracture.
Can't tell till the x-rays are made.

864
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,682
- Will she be able to go on tomorrow?
- Go on?

865
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,393
- She's got the show tomorrow night!
- Not a chance.

866
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,687
She's got to! Do something, doctor!

867
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,772
Get her a pair of crutches.

868
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:11,983
- Oh...
- There, there.

869
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,485
- Don't stand there gaping.
- But...

870
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,529
Oh, get out! Get out!

871
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:21,617
- I still don't know why you're here.
- If it was your business, I'd tell you.

872
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,537
A broken ankle?

873
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,750
It's too bad it wasn't her neck.

874
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,921
May I have your attention?

875
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,549
- Quiet, quiet!
- Quiet, please!

876
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,760
There'll be no performance tonight.

877
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,596
Wait a minute. Wait!

878
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:45,933
Our star, Miss Brock, has had
an accident. She's broken her ankle.

879
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,896
Don't leave the theater until
you're dismissed. Get that, Andy?

880
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,399
Hold the company here
for further instructions.

881
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:57,153
- Stick around, everybody.
- Don't anybody leave the theater!

882
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:02,533
You gotta think of something, someone.
There must be some way out of this.

883
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,494
Dillon just phoned.
He's got everything fixed.

884
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:09,707
- Up to and including Brock's ankle.
- No, he's going through with it.

885
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,626
He's going through with what?

886
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:15,880
He found someone to take Brock's place,
and he's on his way here with her now.

887
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,089
- Where?
- I don't know.

888
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,799
Come on, Marsh.

889
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:20,760
No such luck.

890
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,186
Now, there's a Kiddie Kar
I could really go for.

891
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,815
Anytime Annie. Well, lay me low.

892
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:40,112
Your new leading lady, folks. I guess
I saved the day all right this time.

893
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:42,907
We'd better go in
and talk it over with Marsh.

894
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,664
- You have a big investment in this show.
- You're telling him?

895
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,416
I appreciate your help,
but she won't do.

896
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:55,711
Sure! She didn't wanna do it at first,
but I convinced her.

897
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:58,172
She's all set.
Why, she'll be sensational.

898
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,591
- How about letting me talk?
- All right.

899
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,635
Let's quit kidding, Mr. Marsh.

900
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:06,055
Abbie, all those things sounded swell
at breakfast...

901
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,140
but I can't carry this show.

902
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,101
I know that as well as you do.

903
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,644
I appreciate your honesty.

904
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:15,398
Swell, because you've got somebody
here who can carry your show.

905
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,108
A great little trouper.

906
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,485
Aren't I capable
of selecting my own cast?

907
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,571
But you'd never pick her.
I say she can swing it.

908
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:24,782
How can you lose? You gotta try her.

909
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,450
- Who is she?
- Sawyer.

910
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,453
- Sawyer.
- Yes, Peggy Sawyer.

911
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,623
She can dance rings around Brock.

912
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,167
Your show's half dancing.
She'd kill them.

913
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:38,504
Nobody ever heard of her.
She's a raw kid from the chorus.

914
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,007
Listen, I've been waiting years
for a chance like this...

915
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:46,011
and if I give it up to someone else,
believe me, she's gotta be good.

916
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,391
- Send her in.
- Do you mean it?

917
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,101
Yes, send her in.

918
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:54,854
Mac!

919
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,105
- Oh, Mac!
- Here.

920
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:57,606
- Andy!
- Yes, sir.

921
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,692
- Get Sawyer.
- Yes, sir.

922
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,613
- The boss wants to see you.
- Who, me?

923
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,365
Not your brother. Come on.

924
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,034
- Lorraine, will you hold that?
- Go ahead.

925
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,249
Well, here she is.

926
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,132
Experience?

927
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,426
Just this show, Mr. Marsh.

928
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,721
You know the songs and dances?
Can you play the lead tonight?

929
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,556
The lead?

930
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:34,477
Sure, you can. Don't let him scare you.

931
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,360
I'll give you a chance
because I've got to.

932
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,737
Andy, send Jerry in.

933
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,364
I'll have a live leading lady
or a dead chorus girl.

934
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:50,951
Get out of here. I don't want
anybody in for the next five hours.

935
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,245
- Good luck, honey.
- Come on, you.

936
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,000
Pick it up right after the number.
There's your cue. Speak.

937
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:02,338
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.

938
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,924
No, it's impossible. Impossible.

939
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,136
You're greeting the man you love.
Your entrance speech!

940
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,555
Make it mean something.
Put feeling into it!

941
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:12,848
Listen, like this:

942
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,018
"Jim, they didn't tell me
you were here.

943
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,604
It was grand of you to come."
Let me hear it.

944
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:23,192
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.

945
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:24,944
No, it won't do.

946
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:27,029
Look, have you ever been in love?

947
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,282
Did you ever have a man hold you
in his arms and kiss you?

948
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,292
Now you're in the spirit of the thing.
You love this man.

949
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:42,837
Now, give it all you've got.
Let me hear it.

950
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,882
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.

951
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,134
It was grand of you to come.

952
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:53,013
That's better.
Let me hear it from the beginning.

953
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,307
Go over there
and make your entrance again.

954
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:56,642
All right.

955
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,728
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.

956
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,730
It was grand of you to come.

957
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,835
I can't! I can't...

958
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:24,879
Look here.

959
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,464
You can't, but you will.

960
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:28,924
Please, Mr. Marsh.

961
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,093
You want this chance or don't you?

962
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,054
- All right. Let's try it again.
- All right.

963
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,497
All right, it's fair, only fair.

964
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,250
Come in.

965
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,711
Only an hour before the curtain.

966
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:07,588
Okay, Jerry, that's all.

967
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,722
You let me down, Sawyer, and I'll...

968
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,100
Come on, lie down and relax.

969
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,730
The wardrobe woman will have to
come in to fit your costumes.

970
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,859
But rest all you can, because
you're definitely going on tonight.

971
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:35,240
Julian, how about it?

972
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:38,410
All right, the show goes on.
Wardrobe, everybody.

973
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,165
Everybody, makeup.

974
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:47,753
- Oh, Billy.
- Hello.

975
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,464
I brought some coffee.
You can use a little, huh?

976
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:54,093
Oh, Billy, I'm so excited,
I think maybe I'm dreaming.

977
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:57,388
Oh, no, you're awake, all right.
Don't worry about that.

978
01:06:57,681 --> 01:07:00,140
Billy, what's going to happen to me?

979
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:04,103
You'll be a hit. You'll be the
biggest thing that ever hit Broadway.

980
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:05,521
Oh, I hope so.

981
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,022
Say, I know so.

982
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,525
And I'm for you too. You know that.

983
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,026
Even if...

984
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,861
Even if what?

985
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:14,238
Oh, honey.

986
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:18,575
I've been for you ever since the day
you walked in on me in my BVDs.

987
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:22,705
I wanted to tell you, ever since
I first saw you, how I feel about you.

988
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,916
Oh, I don't know how to say it.

989
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,877
But you know what I mean, don't you?

990
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:33,298
I guess it does sound kind of
funny at that, the way I say it.

991
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:37,344
But the lines are new for me,
at least off-stage.

992
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:41,473
Well, I guess maybe I can read
between the lines, Billy...

993
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:44,393
but I wanna hear you say some more.

994
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:57,489
Billy, it was grand of you to come.

995
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,791
- They told me I'd find you here.
- Miss Brock!

996
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:11,003
You can't talk to her, nobody can.
It's Marsh's orders.

997
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,629
I wanna see her alone.

998
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:13,839
I know, but...

999
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,010
It's all right, Billy.

1000
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,197
So you're going to take my place.

1001
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,491
I'm sorry, Miss Brock.

1002
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:43,118
You're nervous, aren't you?

1003
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,997
Well, don't be.

1004
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,666
The customers out there
want to like you.

1005
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,376
Always remember that, kid.

1006
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,088
I've learned it from experience.

1007
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,381
And you've got so much to give them:

1008
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,593
Youth and beauty and freshness.

1009
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,012
Do you know your lines?

1010
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,514
And your songs?

1011
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,390
And your dance routine?

1012
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,061
Well, you're a cinch.

1013
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:16,401
But... But it's tough
on you, Miss Brock.

1014
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,072
Come here.

1015
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:21,865
Peggy, isn't it?

1016
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:26,245
You know, Peggy, when I started
for the theater tonight...

1017
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,705
I wanted to tear your hair out.

1018
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,833
And then I started thinking.

1019
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,627
Well, after all, I've had my chance.

1020
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,546
And now it's your turn.

1021
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,256
I've had enough.

1022
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:41,802
For five years it's kept me away from
the only thing I ever wanted.

1023
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,096
And a funny thing...

1024
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:47,432
a broken ankle was the thing
that made me find it out.

1025
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:53,939
You know, Peggy, most anyone can have
success with the proper breaks.

1026
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,482
As for me...

1027
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:59,111
I'll take Pat and vaudeville...

1028
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,988
or whatever goes with him.

1029
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,491
We're being married tomorrow.

1030
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,618
Oh, I'm so glad.

1031
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,121
Come in.

1032
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,623
You've gotta hurry, miss.

1033
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:14,626
Come right in, boys. Right over here.

1034
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,438
Overture, places, girls!

1035
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,406
I think it looks very nice now.

1036
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,908
Do I look all right?

1037
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,785
You look adorable.

1038
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:54,166
Now, go out there and be so swell
that you'll make me hate you.

1039
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,459
Thanks.

1040
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:58,921
Remember, girls, I want
a straight line all the way through.

1041
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,673
Marguerite, you're first.
Give me a big smile.

1042
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,343
Get ready. All right, curtain.

1043
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,362
Come on, all right. Get Sawyer.

1044
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,951
When she comes out, I don't want
any of you to say a word to her.

1045
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,370
Here she comes.

1046
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,997
All right, break up.
Pay no attention to her.

1047
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:41,046
Sawyer, you listen to me,
and you listen hard.

1048
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:42,965
Two hundred people, 200 jobs...

1049
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:46,551
$200,000, five weeks of grind,
blood and sweat depend upon you.

1050
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,929
The lives of these people
who've worked with you.

1051
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,348
You've got to go on
and give and give and give.

1052
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,850
They've got to like you, understand?

1053
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:56,144
You can't fall down, because...

1054
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:59,314
your future, my future
and all we have is staked on you.

1055
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,649
Now I'm through.

1056
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,527
Keep your feet on the ground,
your head on your shoulders...

1057
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:06,697
and go out. Sawyer,
you're going out a youngster...

1058
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,283
but you've got to come back a star.

1059
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,119
- There she is.
- There's your cue.

1060
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:13,704
Good luck, honey.

1061
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,169
Well, honey, we couldn't lose them,
and least of all, Jimmy.

1062
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,423
Why, Jim, they didn't tell me
you were here.

1063
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,258
It was grand of you to come.

1064
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,260
All aboard the Niagara Limited!

1065
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,761
Come on, let's go!

1066
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:32,848
That's your light change.

1067
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,517
All right, snap into it. Hurry up, kids.

1068
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,644
Get going. Take it away!

1069
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,476
Break this up. Come here.

1070
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:30,854
You got by, but you're not through yet.

1071
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:33,607
The toughest part's coming.
Don't be a flash in the pan.

1072
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:37,027
There isn't an actor here who doesn't
know what you're going through.

1073
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,613
Now you gotta rest. Rest and relax.

1074
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:41,865
Save it, because you're gonna need it.

1075
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,663
I've been watching you
for a couple weeks.

1076
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,333
If you're nice to the right people,
you'll get along.

1077
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:55,086
- You know these routines?
- Quiet, please.

1078
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,168
Mike, dim those first three borders,
will you? Hurry up.

1079
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:06,212
Places, everybody, for the finale.

1080
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,590
She's a hit, Abner. She's a hit!

1081
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:09,799
Who's a hit?

1082
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,801
Peggy Sawyer.

1083
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:14,137
- Oh.
- Did you do as I told you?

1084
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:18,474
- Oh, no, I didn't.
- Well...

1085
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,977
But I'll take her right out.
Come on, Fifi.

1086
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,228
Well, hurry.

1087
01:28:24,258 --> 01:28:26,175
Directors make me sick. Take Marsh.

1088
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,844
Name all over the program,
gets all the credit.

1089
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,347
If it wasn't for Sawyer,
he wouldn't have a show.

1090
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,474
She'll have Broadway
in her pocket in a week.

1091
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:36,352
- You're right.
- Marsh will say he discovered her.

1092
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:38,145
Some guys get all the breaks.

1092
01:28:39,305 --> 01:29:39,189
