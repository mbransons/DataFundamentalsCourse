1
00:00:44,672 --> 00:00:47,334
Uh, excuse me, sir? Sir?

2
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:52,578
Sir, uh, are you
the janitor of this building?

3
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:55,115
Don't never come up on anybody
like that. What's the matter with you?

4
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:56,411
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:56,484 --> 00:01:01,080
You have the apartment 5-F?
This is 148 Suffolk Street, right?

6
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:02,452
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:04,047
Can I look at the apartment, please?

8
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:09,288
- Yeah, what do you want to do?
- Well, I just... I'd like to see it.

9
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:13,163
I don't know how... you know,
if I want it, but I'd like to see it.

10
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:17,501
Well, you know, it ain't furnished.

11
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,968
Well, a little nail up there would...

12
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:26,070
I leave these lights on 'cause you had
about 12 guys up here the other day.

13
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:29,739
All right, now, first of all,
you've got a shelf up here.

14
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:33,218
You can put everything up here.
And you've got your water.

15
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:38,486
And you've got a combination
bathtub and dishwasher here.

16
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:41,494
And you can just, uh...

17
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,154
Oh, is... what's that?

18
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:45,496
That's, um...

19
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:48,992
Could someone take that out?

20
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,038
Yeah, well, you can take it out.

21
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:54,199
Here you've got a great view,
you know?

22
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:59,143
And, uh, only one flight up,
and you've got the sky.

23
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:02,376
Now, over here,
this is my pride and joy.

24
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,613
This is an oven
that's kept here, right,

25
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:08,246
that... that you open here...

26
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:12,148
You take it as-is, right,
or you don't take it at all.

27
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:14,888
How much did you say
this place rents for?

28
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,520
$75 a month.

29
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:18,521
$75?

30
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,625
Yeah. I didn't know that we had
this much furniture in here.

31
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:23,135
Well, yeah, but...

32
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:27,299
- How much is it, then?
- $66.75.

33
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,569
Sixty-six... well,
it says in the paper...

34
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:30,838
Now, look, I know
what it says in the paper. $45.

35
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:33,073
I didn't know all this furniture
was in here, all right?

36
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:36,639
You know, and the mattresses
go with it. You know?

37
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:38,912
And here, over here...
you don't need to look out there,

38
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,977
because there's the view, right there.

39
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,285
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

40
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,752
Will you shut that door?

41
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:04,559
Leave the coffee
and corned beef on the table.

42
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:09,530
What the hell are you...
I don't want any magazines, kid.

43
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:12,197
You mind? Look what
you're disturbing here, huh?

44
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:13,865
Where do you think you are,
in your own house?

45
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:16,068
- I'm sorry.
- Look at that. Is that gorgeous?

46
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:17,906
You see that cleavage? Huh?

47
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:20,105
Where you gonna get that?
You don't get that in a Fellini film.

48
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:21,478
You get that in a Banner film.

49
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:23,983
Now, this is your public,
you understand?

50
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,349
These guys come
from every walk of life...

51
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,285
middle class, rich, poor.

52
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:30,988
Don't pay any attention.

53
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:33,492
Things go on in there. I shouldn't
even tell you what goes on in there.

54
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:36,394
You come into one of these theaters,
you do not go into the men's room.

55
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:38,091
You understand?
You got that straight?

56
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,792
That's one of the laws.

57
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:43,928
Is that art?

58
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:48,236
- What's going on in there?
- Don't pay any attention to it.

59
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:50,038
Go on, get out from in here.

60
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:53,638
Pervert. Leave him alone.
Who knows where he's been.

61
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:56,740
She looks inhibited, right?

62
00:05:56,817 --> 00:06:00,719
You know why she looks inhibited?
She hasn't had the right direction.

63
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:04,053
She has not been told
who she is in this film.

64
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,218
That girl does not
want to screw anybody.

65
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:09,456
She wants to screw the man of her life,
so who do they put her in with, huh?

66
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,260
Some weirdo with gold hair.

67
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,925
Yeah, that's funny, huh?

68
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,834
What's gonna happen when her mother
sees that picture, know what I mean?

69
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:20,431
Kids should grow up with a feeling
of beauty about their bodies, right?

70
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,840
I mean, my little boy,
my 6-year-old boy,

71
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,003
walks around with a towel
around him all the time.

72
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,910
I mean, why is that, huh?

73
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,711
I don't see my daughter doing that.

74
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:32,284
Hey.

75
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,287
That's all right. He means well.

76
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:37,324
This man is obviously
somebody who needs a movie.

77
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:39,291
But not this movie.

78
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,555
If it were this movie,
he wouldn't be doing this to me.

79
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:43,221
He wouldn't be
putting his hands on my balls.

80
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:50,532
<i>Now, you want to make a film</i>
<i>for me, you've got to have a property.</i>

81
00:06:50,604 --> 00:06:52,868
Kid, kid, this is real estate.

82
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,840
What is this?
Is this gonna sell movies?

83
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,898
Yes.

84
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:57,910
This is gonna sell movies,
a tall building?

85
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:00,276
So what? So that's a phallic symbol.
I know what that is.

86
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:02,178
- No, it's not.
- You trying to teach me something?

87
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:05,082
A tall building? Listen,
I used to watch <i>Superman</i>

88
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:07,086
when I was a little kid, too,
you know what I mean?

89
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:09,247
You're not gonna teach me
anything new with just a tall building.

90
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:10,654
The reason I've come to see you

91
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:12,385
is because I know that
you're a good producer...

92
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,325
Take a look at that top floor.

93
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:17,354
- Who took this picture?
- I took these pictures.

94
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,989
You know what you've got
on that top floor?

95
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,091
The top floor is an old woman.
That's not an interesting picture.

96
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:22,533
- An old woman?
- Yes! No, no!

97
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:23,865
You'd better have
your eyes checked, kid.

98
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,202
Look what he's showing me.
Look what's gonna sell money, right?

99
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,400
You got the right idea.
You like titties, right?

100
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:29,602
- Right?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:32,111
You'll buy this before you'll
buy that picture, won't you?

102
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,942
- I'll show you something.
- Go on, show him something.

103
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:35,538
Go on,
see if you can make a sale.

104
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,516
- You see, these are four windows.
- It's gorgeous, isn't it?

105
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,951
You could really go home
and jerk off to that, couldn't you?

106
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,009
Wait a minute, Mr. Banner!

107
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:43,579
You could really go home and put
your thing right through the window.

108
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:46,251
These are the most interesting windows
of this side of the building.

109
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:47,692
There are 270 windows.

110
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:49,092
- I'm taking your word for that?
- Yes.

111
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:53,099
Now, what I have, see,
I have this telescope here, see?

112
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:56,227
I've got this telescope,
and I get the activities of all these...

113
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:58,965
the secretaries, the revolutionary,
the hippy... young hippies...

114
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,566
this playboy down here, and then
up there, you've got a housewife.

115
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:04,668
That's what I don't understand.
How do you know they live there?

116
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,406
How do I know they live there?

117
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,914
I've been watching them.
I have all the photographs.

118
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:10,814
I have all the film, the 8mm film.

119
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:13,547
And then I've got this telescope,
you see, and I do this.

120
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:16,283
And you set it up here,
and, you know,

121
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,917
it's what I call "peep" art,
and I think it's fantastic,

122
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:20,654
because you get
all these private moments.

123
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:22,093
You get all these people together,

124
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:23,823
and they don't know
they're being watched.

125
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:26,264
Its not like in those photographs
in that bookstore,

126
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,062
but these are <i>real</i> activities.

127
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:31,104
You think people are stupid?
You think people are stupid?

128
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:33,298
You think people don't know
when they're being watched?

129
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:34,602
No, they don't know.

130
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:36,506
You think I don't know
that you're watching me now?

131
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:39,603
The only compromise in this
is when someone pulls the blinds.

132
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,012
- Why don't you look?
- I'm gonna see what you see, right?

133
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:43,174
Look on the 16th floor.

134
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,184
You think people don't know
when they're being watched, right?

135
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:46,241
Mr. Banner, can I just...

136
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,811
Don't "Mr. Banner" me.
You're getting me nervous.

137
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,119
- All right, now, look in that window.
- Call me Joe.

138
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:53,557
- What?
- Oh, there she is.

139
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:55,117
Go ahead, look, look.
Just watch, watch.

140
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,722
- Can you see her?
- Hey, hey!

141
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,768
I see, like, a very funny broad
with a red towel, right?

142
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:03,393
Right, right, right, right.

143
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,301
Now, you like it.
I'm glad you like it.

144
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:07,203
- What's your name? Jon, right?
- Jon, right.

145
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:10,038
280 windows.
<i>Confessions of a Peeping Jon.</i>

146
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,271
Oh, yeah, well, that's...
Okay.

147
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,870
- That's what?
- Okay, okay.

148
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:16,075
- You patronizing me?
- No. You gonna give me the money?

149
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,913
You putting up with me?
I'm putting up with <i>you.</i>

150
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:20,249
- You don't have to put up with me.
- I'm not putting up with you!

151
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:21,845
I'm just saying,
give me the money, and I'll do it.

152
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:25,688
I told you, I'm scared of heights.
I'm nervous up here.

153
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,160
You need a lens.
I like the idea. It's a good idea.

154
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,787
It's a good idea, kid.

155
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:33,196
It's a good idea.
Too bad you don't have a lens.

156
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:36,600
You need a lens! What, are you
gonna work with that piece of crap?

157
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,467
What are you doing
to my equipment?

158
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,700
I'm waiting for her to take off...
I could see her from here better!

159
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:42,674
- Look at this!
- Well, I know I need a lens.

160
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,075
You see these? These are
$12 prescription glasses.

161
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:47,613
I can see probably clearer.
Look at that.

162
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:50,582
I have no trouble now seeing her.
I'll get you a lens from Harry.

163
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:53,279
You go down to Harry,
he'll send you to ABC Camera,

164
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:55,049
you go down, you get the lens,
you get the works.

165
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:56,521
- You will?
- You better deliver.

166
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,579
I will, I promise!

167
00:09:57,658 --> 00:10:01,116
You get a lens, you sit in your bathtub,
you'll be able to take pictures.

168
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:03,425
Oh, Mr. Banner, that's fantastic.
Can I shake your hand?

169
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,624
When you get to know me better,
we'll shake hands.

170
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,963
Right now it's strictly business,
you understand?

171
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:10,833
That's great, Mr. Banner. Listen,
how much money can you give me?

172
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:13,304
Don't worry about it.
Whatever it costs. What do you need?

173
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:15,706
Well, I need about...
I'd like to have about $2,000.

174
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:18,711
$2,000? All right,
so I'll give you about $2,000.

175
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:21,772
Get out.
You're gonna give me $2,000?

176
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,317
- I'm gonna give you $2,000.
- You're really gonna give me $2,000?

177
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:26,478
That's right, I'm a schmuck,
I know. I trust you, kid.

178
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:29,351
I know, I know, I know.
I've got a good heart.

179
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:30,651
You remind me of...

180
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:32,487
What's the difference
who you remind me of?

181
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,153
He was killed in the war, anyway.
He was a good kid.

182
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:38,323
He went away. I was gonna
teach him the business, you know that?

183
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,889
What business was that?

184
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,028
- You trying to make fun of me?
- I'm sorry.

185
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:44,092
What?

186
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:46,537
I'm taking you in off the street,
you're making fun of me?

187
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:50,099
My cousin Marshall. My cousin
Marshall would have had this job,

188
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:52,270
would have had the opportunity
that you're gonna have.

189
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,110
Mr. Banner, I'm very sorry.
I'd like to shake your hand.

190
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:58,777
I'm sorry.
Can I expect a check from you?

191
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,877
You just tell Harry
to send the bills to me.

192
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:04,448
And what you're actually doing
is setting the camera motor on,

193
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:07,983
and you can just
take pictures of yourself.

194
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,622
That's right.
You just push this button.

195
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:12,165
Like this?

196
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:14,462
And as far as the sound is concerned,

197
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,935
the sound is recorded
in this microphone.

198
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,301
- Oh, I see.
- Right here.

199
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:20,636
Does it have...
what do you...? A zoom?

200
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,302
Yes. Now, I'll show you
how to operate the zoom.

201
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:25,402
You just twist this like so...

202
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:28,812
and your subject will come
closer and closer and closer.

203
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:29,974
Yeah, I see.

204
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,018
- Isn't that great?
- I can do that, right.

205
00:11:32,086 --> 00:11:33,678
- Isn't that great?
- Yes.

206
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:36,655
Now, are you familiar
with the exposure?

207
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:38,487
No, I don't really know
anything about it.

208
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,551
Well, you see this little ring
around the center here?

209
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:42,652
Yeah, right here?

210
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,631
Well, you just turn that
slowly and slowly,

211
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:48,759
and the camera will automatically
set itself for the proper exposure.

212
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:50,667
- What's exposure?
- That's right.

213
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:53,605
Well, it's the correct lightness
and darkness of the picture.

214
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:55,141
Oh, yeah, I see.
The light and the dark.

215
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,676
Yes. You see how that works?

216
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:58,644
Now, you want to try the zoom now?

217
00:11:58,712 --> 00:11:59,701
Yeah.

218
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,180
Let's zoom right across the room,
right over there.

219
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,739
Okay.

220
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:05,717
I'll take that man's
picture right there.

221
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,084
You're getting him
right in the picture.

222
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:10,783
Uh-huh. But it's
all out of focus now.

223
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,792
- Well, we'll fix that.
- Oh, I see.

224
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,521
You get sound just like Hollywood.

225
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,679
You can sing.

226
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,351
They can do anything
they want, anything.

227
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:43,952
Who's there?

228
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,658
Jon Rubin.

229
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:51,236
- Jon Rubin?
- Yes, Jon Rubin. Hi.

230
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,101
How are you?
I'm your computer date.

231
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:54,401
Computer date?

232
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:56,567
Yes. ABC Computer Dating.
Very nice to meet you.

233
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:58,235
I never ordered a computer date.

234
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,745
If you didn't, somebody who
certainly looks very much like you did.

235
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:03,248
As a matter of fact, you look
much better than your photograph.

236
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:06,251
As a matter of fact,
you're quite a knockout!

237
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,083
Well, I think we have
approximately 15 minutes.

238
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:10,817
Do you know my name?

239
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:13,257
Well, of course I know your name.
Jo Ann Larch.

240
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,727
- Judy.
- Judy?

241
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:18,662
- Judy Bishop.
- Oh, Judy Bishop?

242
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:20,597
Ha ha! Very funny. You've got
a very good sense of humor.

243
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:23,135
As a matter of fact,
I punched that in. I'm very glad.

244
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:25,694
Well, let's get going, will you,
because we don't have much time.

245
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:28,206
Well, I think there must be
some mistake.

246
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,607
Hello, is this
ABC Computer Dating?

247
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:33,009
Yes, my name is Jon Rubin,

248
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,071
and there seems to be
some mistake here.

249
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:38,049
I'm at the apartment
of a Judy Bishop,

250
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:40,450
505 LaGuardia Place.

251
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:49,626
A Judy Bishop
of 505 LaGuardia Place...

252
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:56,326
and, uh... uh...
it seems that there's some mistake,

253
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:59,566
because I have come here
under the assumption

254
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,368
that we were to have a date tonight,

255
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:06,037
and, uh, it seems that Miss Bishop
knows nothing about it...

256
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:10,917
and so I would like to find out
what's happening here.

257
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:13,418
I happen to have tickets
for Cinema Sociables,

258
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,580
dining, and dancing,
and I have a cab waiting outside,

259
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:18,146
and it seems that
there's just nothing here now,

260
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,487
and I'm quite upset about it,

261
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,993
and I seem to be
feeling quite degraded.

262
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:25,657
Now, could you please
tell me what the story is?

263
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,935
There seems to be some mistake?

264
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:31,334
There <i>is</i> a mistake?

265
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,840
It's 505 LaGuardia Place
in the Bronx?

266
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:37,934
Well, I'm... I'm...
You <i>should</i> be sorry!

267
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:40,275
You should absolutely be sorry!

268
00:18:40,347 --> 00:18:41,336
What?

269
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:45,874
Well, I'm afraid I'll just have to report it
to the Better Business Bureau, yes.

270
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:49,046
Well, the least you can do
is send my $3 back.

271
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:51,090
Do you know my address?

272
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:53,718
That's right. Goodbye.

273
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:00,364
What's that?

274
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,230
Oh, nothing, nothing. L...

275
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:04,532
Well, I spoke to them on the phone,
and they said that, uh,

276
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:06,367
that there must have been
some mistake.

277
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:09,408
The LaGuardia Place that
I was told to go to is in the Bronx,

278
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:11,068
so I really feel terrible.

279
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:14,079
- What a shame.
- Yes, I feel like quite a fool.

280
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:15,739
Oh, don't be silly.

281
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:17,908
Well, I do. I feel as if
I've degraded myself

282
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:21,249
and embarrassed you,
and I really, really feel very bad.

283
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,915
I'm quite sorry,
and now I have these tickets,

284
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,423
and I can't do anything with them.

285
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:30,259
I mean, uh, I can't get my money back,
because they're non-returnable.

286
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,991
Well, there must be <i>somebody...</i>

287
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:35,762
And I can't call anyone, you know.
I'd feel kinda silly just calling a girl now.

288
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:39,271
...some girl in New York City
who's free tonight.

289
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:44,605
Wonder what I did...? Oh.
Ah! Here they are.

290
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,112
Yeah, I just don't know.

291
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,172
I guess the only thing to do is...

292
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,115
Oh, don't be silly!

293
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:53,447
No.

294
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,509
Well...

295
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:58,457
Well, I don't know.
I just can't call a girl now.

296
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:00,254
There must be someone.

297
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:03,060
Oh, listen, um...

298
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:09,461
I-I don't want to be rude or, you know,
crass or vulgar or impolite.

299
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,800
I certainly wouldn't want to do that...
I've already embarrassed you enough...

300
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:14,999
but I was just thinking, um...

301
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:18,841
perhaps, uh...
perhaps, uh...

302
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,005
<i>...</i>you would like to go.
- Yes!

303
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:23,777
You would? All right.

304
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,318
Oh, actually, I had a date,

305
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:29,412
but I-I cancelled it

306
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:33,357
because it, uh, it snowed.

307
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:39,831
- You could go?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:42,094
Oh, fantastic.
Well, come on, let's go.

309
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:57,240
Oh, wow.

310
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:00,251
What a beautiful movie.

311
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,121
It's so personal to me, that...
that child-woman.

312
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,452
At times, she's a little girl,

313
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:13,022
terrified by the brutality
and ugliness of reality,

314
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:15,363
and she has to talk in rhyme

315
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:18,404
to preserve her fantasy world.

316
00:21:18,471 --> 00:21:21,133
And then, at times...

317
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,074
the woman... this sexual-driven,
passionate woman...

318
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:28,376
bursts forth like a ripe fruit.

319
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:31,076
So much wanting.

320
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:32,948
And then that frightens her,

321
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:36,978
and she has to go
back into the little girl again

322
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:40,823
and talk in rhyme.

323
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:42,521
Yeah.

324
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:46,554
You know,
tragedy is a funny thing.

325
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:50,433
Oh, wow. It certainly is.

326
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:52,494
Just breaks my heart.

327
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:56,099
You know, I think
I understand this movie really well

328
00:21:56,176 --> 00:22:00,476
because I had a personal experience.

329
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:03,983
I was going with Danny
in high school,

330
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,850
and we were at Jim Thorpe High.

331
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:11,619
And Danny...
Danny and I were really close,

332
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:13,852
except there wasn't any magic,
you know what I mean?

333
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,224
We weren't really...

334
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,787
And, um, we went
to this party together,

335
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:22,301
and, well, this person was there.

336
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,033
This person, he was like
the high school heartthrob, you know?

337
00:22:27,107 --> 00:22:28,597
Everybody was crazy about him.

338
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:30,836
And I never thought
he'd look at me or anything.

339
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,846
I never thought he'd pay any attention
to me, and suddenly, out of the blue,

340
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:38,475
he began talking to me,
and then he began dancing with me,

341
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:40,815
and, well, we were communicating.

342
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:44,755
We were talking about things
I'd never talked to anyone about before.

343
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,257
We were really close.

344
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:48,954
And he said to me,
"Would you leave with me?

345
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:51,929
We're two special people,
and we should leave together,"

346
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:53,431
he said.

347
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,492
And I said yes,
because it was so special.

348
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:59,470
And, well, we got into his car,

349
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:01,734
and we drove to the quarry,

350
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:05,437
and it was a very beautiful night,

351
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:07,776
and... well...

352
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:13,685
I had all these feelings inside of me
that I'd never had for anyone before,

353
00:23:13,753 --> 00:23:19,453
and, well, I gave myself
to him, completely.

354
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:20,754
Oh. Oh, you did?

355
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:26,765
And, um, it was
very beautiful, I-I thought.

356
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:30,996
And, uh, when it was over...

357
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:33,938
I-I said to him...

358
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,498
and it wasn't because
I wanted to get engaged

359
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:37,975
or I wanted him to pin me

360
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,137
or I wanted to go steady
or anything like that.

361
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:42,204
It was because I had for him

362
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:45,342
the biggest feeling I'd ever had
for anyone in my whole life.

363
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:46,749
Ever.

364
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,755
And I said to him, "I love you."

365
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:51,313
And I looked in his face...

366
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:56,887
and he had the most sick,
ugly, peculiar grin on his face.

367
00:23:58,164 --> 00:23:59,995
He was laughing at me!

368
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:03,162
Do you mind
if I put my hand here?

369
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,931
No.

370
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:06,494
Well, as you can imagine,

371
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:08,564
I mean, everything
inside me went cold.

372
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:11,439
I became inwardly hysterical.

373
00:24:12,512 --> 00:24:14,844
And I-I looked up at him,

374
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:17,940
and in my nakedness, l...

375
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:19,279
you may not believe this...

376
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:26,121
I said to him,
"Roger, Roger, look at me.

377
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:30,391
Roger, Roger, what do you see?"

378
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:37,192
That reminds me of something
that happened to me.

379
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:40,566
I was coming home.

380
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,974
I was living with a girl, Barbara,
a few years ago, and, uh...

381
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:47,742
it was her birthday,
and I came home,

382
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:50,408
and I had presents
and a cake and candles,

383
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:53,919
and all kinds of confetti
and crepe paper,

384
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:57,650
and I was rushing
up the stairs, ecstatic.

385
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:01,422
I opened the door very quietly
and crept in,

386
00:25:01,494 --> 00:25:02,927
and I heard the shower running.

387
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:05,726
Well, I opened
the door to the bathroom...

388
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,267
and I hear some voices.

389
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:12,630
And all of a sudden
I open the shower curtain,

390
00:25:12,705 --> 00:25:14,002
and then, there are...

391
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,602
there she is with another person.

392
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:20,145
They were... they were...
they were naked.

393
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:23,273
And the funny thing about it was,
he had this kind of laugh,

394
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:25,783
this kind of grin,
this kind of evil grin,

395
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:27,444
and it... it really threw me,

396
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,786
and I naturally ran out of the place
in a state of shock.

397
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:33,792
I didn't know what to do, and...

398
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,853
But, you know, come to think of it,

399
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,796
his name was Roger,

400
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:42,061
because I was
introduced to him once before.

401
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:43,261
It was?

402
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:44,496
And he...

403
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,131
Did you say this Roger
was from Jim Thorpe, PA?

404
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:50,336
Jim Thorpe, PA?
What was his last name?

405
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,071
Parks. Roger Parks.

406
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:53,544
Roger Parks?

407
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:56,907
Well... well, I'll be damned.

408
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:58,974
Do you know that's
the same Roger Parks

409
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:01,282
who was in the shower with Barbara?
Do you know that?

410
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:04,084
That same son of a bitch
was in the shower with Barbara!

411
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:06,250
That goddamn...

412
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,593
<i>...</i>son of a bastard!
- Oh, no! Oh!

413
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:14,099
Oh, look what I've done.
Oh, I'm sorry.

414
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:17,568
- Oh, are you all right?
- In a moment of passion, I...

415
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:19,969
I got excited. I'm sorry.

416
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,599
I must've acted like a fool,
and I've ruined the pizza.

417
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:24,302
I'm... I'm sorry.

418
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:26,436
Please forgive me.
It's just that...

419
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,275
It's all right. Poor you.

420
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:30,282
Oh, you poor thing.
That's terrible.

421
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,114
We were both victimized
by that... that... that brute,

422
00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:35,381
that... that... that...

423
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:39,450
Oh, l...
oh, I get so...

424
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:40,787
Oh, I'm...

425
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,055
I get so...

426
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:44,426
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:44,497 --> 00:26:46,624
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Please forgive me.

428
00:26:46,699 --> 00:26:48,166
You poor thing.

429
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,801
You poor thing.

430
00:26:57,477 --> 00:26:59,069
Be gentle with me.

431
00:26:59,145 --> 00:27:01,238
I will, Judy, but not now.

432
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:04,579
We've both had
a very exhausting evening,

433
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,209
and we're both drained, and...

434
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:07,274
Well, when?

435
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:10,584
Well, as I've said,
we're both very drained,

436
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:13,091
and we've had quite
an unusual experience this evening,

437
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:14,558
a wonderful experience.

438
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:16,788
I happen to be
a person of the weather,

439
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:19,764
and I hear that tomorrow
the forecast is not too good.

440
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:21,857
It's going to be
cloudy and rainy all day,

441
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,596
but Sunday is going to be
sunny and beautiful,

442
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:28,163
and I think that's the day we should
get together and rendezvous.

443
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:10,238
This is the wonderful view we have

444
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:12,709
from the living room
and bedroom windows.

445
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,077
It's really nice, because
how many people in New York

446
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:17,742
can look out their window
and see this much space?

447
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:20,251
Usually they're just looking
into the side of another building

448
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,184
or into somebody else's window.

449
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,951
This is the housing project
across the street.

450
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:28,290
It's not nearly as nice
as the one we live in.

451
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:30,261
This is our housing project, see?

452
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:33,256
I don't like that one at all.

453
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:36,392
This one is really pretty.
It's really modern.

454
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:40,462
And the cement blocks,
all one color.

455
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,633
We live on the sixth floor.

456
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:45,768
Let's see, not counting
the big windows on the bottom,

457
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:49,747
go up one, two, three,

458
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:54,150
four, five, six,

459
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,688
and over to the...
let's see...

460
00:29:56,756 --> 00:29:59,816
second and third window,
that's right.

461
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:02,221
Let's see now, l...

462
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:03,956
Um, this is my elevator.

463
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,828
It's an automatic elevator,
so we don't need a doorman.

464
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:10,430
And, um...

465
00:30:11,437 --> 00:30:15,806
- Oh. Hi, Gerrit.
- Hello, Mrs. Mitchell.

466
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,639
This is a neighbor of mine.
Lives upstairs.

467
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:22,647
And, um...

468
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:25,809
Can you hold the door,
'cause I'm trying to take a...

469
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:27,352
Um, thank you.

470
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:30,488
What are you putting up there?

471
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:33,525
- It's a poster.
- I think I'll come in and ride with you.

472
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:39,993
What is that you're putting...?

473
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:42,762
Are you allowed to put things up
in an elevator like that?

474
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:43,824
I don't know.

475
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:46,337
What is that?
Is that a naked girl?

476
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,236
- Yep.
- My goodness.

477
00:30:49,508 --> 00:30:51,738
Well, what, is it
an advertisement for something?

478
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:52,800
Yeah.

479
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:53,868
What?

480
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,041
A play.

481
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:58,208
I'm trying out my new movie camera.

482
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:02,381
Gerrit is a student at...
where do you go to school, Gerrit?

483
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:04,355
- NYU.
- Are you in the play?

484
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:05,412
Uh-huh.

485
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:06,958
Oh, are you really?

486
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:09,290
I guess that's why
you grew a beard, huh?

487
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:13,764
A lot of actors have beards, don't they?

488
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:16,564
Are you gonna leave that
there in the elevator?

489
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:18,501
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll have to come see it.

490
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:27,194
Shoot 'em!

491
00:33:12,018 --> 00:33:14,111
...black in America?
Why not?

492
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:16,950
You live in America,
why can't you learn to be part of it?

493
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,149
'Cause I'm not black.

494
00:33:18,224 --> 00:33:20,624
Well, now you can find out
what it's like to be black.

495
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:22,752
I'd like to talk to you. You have
the kind of face that looks like...

496
00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:24,455
- No, I'm real busy.
- You <i>are</i> busy?

497
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,624
Why are you so busy you don't want
to know what it's like to be black?

498
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,895
- Sorry. So I'm busy.
- You're very busy?

499
00:33:29,969 --> 00:33:31,937
Do you have black people
in your neighborhood, sir?

500
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:34,632
Excuse me, sir, do you know
what it's like to be black in America?

501
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:36,971
- Say what?
- To be black in America.

502
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:38,567
- Yes. I do.
- You do?

503
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,805
Would it interest you
to learn more about black people

504
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,871
and how it is to be
black in this society...

505
00:33:43,983 --> 00:33:45,473
to go through the experience?

506
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,010
I don't know
what are you talking about.

507
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:51,488
Excuse me, sir, do you know
what it's like to be black in America?

508
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:59,487
You've got to go back to work?
Are there any black people at your job?

509
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:04,893
Black people have been
imitating white people for so long,

510
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,438
they know how to act like you all act,
so, I mean, what's your whole problem?

511
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,098
Why can't you go through
the black experience?

512
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:12,702
I don't have any problem. I don't care
if you're green, blue, or yellow.

513
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:14,939
We know.
We understand that.

514
00:34:15,014 --> 00:34:16,777
That's an admirable attitude.

515
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:19,716
Have you ever thought about what
it would be like to be a black woman?

516
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:21,116
She doesn't look black.

517
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:23,951
It's a question of
understanding it from the inside

518
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:26,184
as opposed to understanding it
from the outside.

519
00:34:26,258 --> 00:34:28,283
It's easy to say,
"I live next door to somebody."

520
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,987
That's just saying that you're liberal.

521
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:31,791
I'm not a liberal, I'm a radical.

522
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,627
I mean, you know,

523
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:37,533
you're not talking to a white liberal
walking around the Village.

524
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:40,436
You know, we have been
on many marches in Harlem.

525
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:44,237
We've done lots of things.
We haven't been born today, you know.

526
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,210
All of intellectual white America's
been on marches

527
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:47,973
and given to the NAACP
and attended lectures.

528
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,572
How do you expect to be
where you are now if we don't help you?

529
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,742
- I'm not saying that.
- We know why we're here.

530
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,786
Because you
helped us stay there. Right.

531
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:56,913
You have an obligation
if somebody's a human.

532
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,980
Well, of course. I understand that.

533
00:34:59,058 --> 00:35:01,526
And it's not attending marches,
and it's not going to lectures,

534
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:03,425
and it's not giving money
to the NAACP.

535
00:35:03,496 --> 00:35:05,054
Just what do you want from us?

536
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,099
I want you to check this out,
that's what I want.

537
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,498
Come and see our show,
<i>Be Black Baby.</i>

538
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:14,096
Listen, we know all about this.
This is nothing new to us.

539
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:17,609
Intellectual experiences don't have
nothing to do with physical experiences.

540
00:35:17,676 --> 00:35:19,610
You think we're unimaginative?
We've been all through this.

541
00:35:19,678 --> 00:35:22,545
It's not about your imagination.
It's about what you live, lady.

542
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:24,947
And you can't intellectualize it,
you understand? You have to live it.

543
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:26,678
It isn't a matter of intellectualizing.

544
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,686
That's what you just said...
you have a good imagination.

545
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:31,314
Come on, I'll owe it to you,
you bastard!

546
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,449
...well, of course there are.

547
00:35:33,526 --> 00:35:35,824
- You have anything to do with them?
- But of course.

548
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:36,884
Like what?

549
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:38,759
We see them in the morning,
we say hello to them,

550
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:40,298
just like to anybody else.

551
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:42,197
Look, there are now scholarships.

552
00:35:42,268 --> 00:35:45,066
If you want to take advantage
of the situation now...

553
00:35:45,137 --> 00:35:47,731
You gotta kiss somebody's ass
to get a scholarship.

554
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,296
Oh, come on.

555
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,071
A large part of your clients
are black, aren't they?

556
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:53,304
Yes.

557
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:56,906
Can I ask you
if you ever feel guilty...

558
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:59,109
I mean, if your conscience
ever bothers you?

559
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:01,278
Never at all.
Never at all, my friend.

560
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:03,287
Do you know, do you have
any idea what I'm talking about?

561
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:04,845
I think I have a good idea
what you're talking about.

562
00:36:04,924 --> 00:36:06,915
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
what I'm talking about, man.

563
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:08,926
You got stuff in this store

564
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:12,088
that is the shoddiest merchandise
I've ever seen.

565
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:14,962
You have committed your life,

566
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:18,003
you have made it your life's work

567
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,335
to suck in
the poorest people in this town

568
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:24,934
and sell them
the shoddiest trash I've ever seen

569
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,774
for the most blown-up,
exorbitant prices

570
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:31,577
I could ever have expected
to see anywhere.

571
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,279
You are a pillar in the system

572
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:37,379
that is oppressing the black people

573
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:40,220
and all the poor people in the world,
no matter what color they are, man!

574
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:43,227
Do you realize that?
Are you aware of that at all?

575
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:46,389
I'm aware of everything, but I'm really
surprised you're even talking this way.

576
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:48,399
You notice our prices
that we charge over here?

577
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:49,832
Do you know what we sell over here?

578
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:51,494
- Incredibly over...
- We are the cheapest.

579
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,060
We are the cheapest.

580
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:56,403
We defy anyone
to undersell our prices!

581
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:57,965
We give everything away.

582
00:36:58,043 --> 00:37:00,034
But you're being a tool, mister!

583
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:03,104
I'm being used? I'm being used?
For what price?

584
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:05,173
You being used
to suck in people, mister.

585
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:07,082
Man, you got
the wrong impression.

586
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:10,144
No, I ain't, because you tell people
to buy this garbage, mister!

587
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:12,713
I tell people to buy this garbage.
You know why?

588
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:15,419
Because... because...
because I'm being paid!

589
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:18,088
You tell Puerto Rican people,
you tell crackers, you tell black people...

590
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:20,927
Well, nobody's twisting their arm
to walk in that door!

591
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,265
Nobody's twisting you to stand
out here and sell this bullshit!

592
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:25,928
For a price! For a price, man!

593
00:37:26,005 --> 00:37:27,336
That means you done
sold yourself, right?

594
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:29,431
I ain't sold myself!
It's a matter of opinion!

595
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:32,500
But that's what you're doing, right?
Telling people to buy this garbage!

596
00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:33,840
That's <i>your</i> opinion!

597
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:35,379
- That's what it is!
- Well, I'll tell you what...

598
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:37,608
...get a police
and have me arrested!

599
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:40,618
No, no, brother, I want to appeal to you.
I don't want to get no police on you.

600
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,517
- Why you want to appeal to me?
- Because you a black man!

601
00:37:42,588 --> 00:37:43,714
You damn right!

602
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:00,967
"There's just nothing you can do.

603
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,008
It's uncanny, but there's
nothing you can do."

604
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:04,542
I'll start crying there.

605
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,135
That'll take about three...
I'll give myself three minutes

606
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:09,077
just to make sure
the crying and everything...

607
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:10,581
really build it up.

608
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:12,583
If that doesn't get her,
I don't know what will.

609
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:15,643
If she doesn't say, "Oh, Jon,
is there anything I can do?"

610
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:16,915
And I'll say, "I can't ask you."

611
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:19,048
"Oh, please, Jon, take me now."

612
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:22,252
And I'll say, "Oh, oh, Estelle...
I-I mean... I mean, Judy."

613
00:38:22,328 --> 00:38:24,660
And she'll say, "No, no, Jon,
say what's ever in your heart.

614
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,927
"If it's Estelle, it's Estelle,

615
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,436
"and I know that sooner or later, you'll
love me, and everything will be fine."

616
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:33,027
And I'll say...

617
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,573
Let's see, that oughtta take
about two more minutes.

618
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:36,835
That'll take, uh...

619
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:38,934
And, "Oh, Jon, take me."

620
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:41,104
And so, let's see, I'll get her
up against the ledge here,

621
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,171
and then I'll kiss her a few times,

622
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:45,079
and then I'll start undoing her blouse.

623
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,141
Make sure she's facing the camera.

624
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:49,653
I'll have to turn her. It'll be
a little awkward, but I'll get her there.

625
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:51,713
Let's see... that oughtta...

626
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,727
Yeah, that's 26-and-a-half minutes...
26-and-a-half minutes...

627
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,923
It's now 9:57.

628
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:01,898
I have to be there at 10:00.

629
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:06,131
It's 9:57 plus 20 seconds.
That gives me 40 seconds.

630
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:10,699
39... 38... 37... 36...

631
00:39:10,776 --> 00:39:15,236
35... 34... 33... 32...

632
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:52,241
...11... 10... 9...

633
00:39:52,317 --> 00:39:55,445
8... 7... 6...

634
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,853
5... 4... 3...

635
00:39:57,923 --> 00:39:59,151
2... 1.

636
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,021
Well, coat.

637
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:08,259
Coat.

638
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:15,195
I guess you'll want to know
why I have two watches here.

639
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:19,142
You see, the left watch,
which is my uncle's, runs correctly,

640
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,975
and the one which is my watch,
this one on the right here...

641
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,947
uh, I've got to explain this to you...

642
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:27,816
happens to be
about five minutes off,

643
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,320
so if you notice that I keep
looking at it every few seconds,

644
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:31,879
it's only because
I'm trying to check it now,

645
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:33,686
because I paid $30 to have it fixed.

646
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,158
What's for breakfast?

647
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,489
Uh... me!

648
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,826
Ha ha ha! Very funny!

649
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:40,831
No, what's for breakfast, seriously?

650
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:41,888
Huh?

651
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,491
I'd like a four-minute egg.

652
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:46,436
I'd like a four-minute egg,
not sooner or faster.

653
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:48,803
Oh, come on,
forget about breakfast.

654
00:40:48,874 --> 00:40:50,603
I'll bet you cook
just like my mother.

655
00:40:50,676 --> 00:40:51,938
- Mother?
- Yes.

656
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,500
You want a mother figure, honey?

657
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,410
No, I mean, I bet
you make a four-minute egg

658
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:57,278
just like my mother
made fantastic four-minute eggs,

659
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:59,112
though my mother
did do one thing...

660
00:40:59,184 --> 00:41:01,880
and that was that she'd make me
go to dancing school all the time,

661
00:41:01,954 --> 00:41:03,922
and I met a girl named Estelle there,

662
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,583
and Estelle was the only girl
who would dance with me, though,

663
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:09,821
and sometimes, uh, Estelle and I

664
00:41:09,895 --> 00:41:11,886
would... would...
would be alone in the country.

665
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:13,659
For example,
once we were on a rock,

666
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:15,927
and we made love and...
you know what happened to Estelle?

667
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,798
Make love to <i>me,</i> sweetie!

668
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,464
Well, something happens to...
she... she's...

669
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:22,666
- Come on.
- Estelle was killed.

670
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:25,574
Estelle was killed.

671
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:26,941
We were on a...

672
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:29,810
We were driving along, and, um...

673
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:33,147
all of a sudden, the car turned over,
and rolled over about 23 times.

674
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:34,207
Come on!

675
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:35,651
I walked out without a scratch,

676
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:39,487
and Estelle
was damaged beyond repair.

677
00:41:39,558 --> 00:41:41,389
You're kidding!
That's terrible!

678
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,588
The car burst into flames,
and she was burnt to a crisp.

679
00:41:44,663 --> 00:41:46,927
Why are you telling me this?

680
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:50,435
Well, I just want to tell you,
I'm a very sensitive person,

681
00:41:50,502 --> 00:41:53,938
and I can't just jump
into bed with you like this.

682
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:56,099
But I fell in love with you!
Come on!

683
00:41:56,174 --> 00:41:57,937
Well, I-I love you, too,

684
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,774
but it's just that... uh... uh...
you know, it's...

685
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:04,338
And then Estelle and I
went to, uh... well...

686
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,782
- Oh, please.
- I feel very badly about Estelle now.

687
00:42:06,852 --> 00:42:09,946
- This was a few years ago...
- This is not the time for Estelle.

688
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:12,115
...and now I see a psychiatrist
about five times a week,

689
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,851
and he told me that, uh...

690
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:19,990
well, he told me that I can't have sex
except under certain conditions,

691
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:22,465
and he said that it's a matter of time,
it's a matter of time.

692
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:24,195
- I have to get to know somebody first.
- I'll be gentle!

693
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:25,964
- No, no.
- I'll be gentle.

694
00:42:26,038 --> 00:42:28,632
I have to get to know you.
Look, would you do me a favor?

695
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:30,868
Would you wait about 25 minutes?

696
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:33,309
Wait? Why?

697
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:36,541
I-I can't explain it. It's difficult.

698
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:40,981
It's difficult. I can't explain.

699
00:42:41,987 --> 00:42:44,478
Oh, let me comfort you, sweetie.

700
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:46,751
If you could only
wait a few minutes.

701
00:42:46,825 --> 00:42:49,453
- Just a few!
- Here, lie down.

702
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,758
Okay. Just wait, though,
because I have to get to know you first.

703
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,593
Right. Just lie down.

704
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:55,462
I mean, I just don't...
it's not proper...

705
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:57,365
I just don't jump into bed
with every girl I see.

706
00:42:57,436 --> 00:42:58,903
I-I like you.

707
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:01,906
I just don't go around flattering people
and saying how much I like them

708
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:03,805
unless I really like them.

709
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:04,864
Right.

710
00:43:04,943 --> 00:43:07,275
So, why can't you...
can you wait a few minutes?

711
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:08,335
Sure.

712
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:09,402
Good, good.

713
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:12,578
I-I forgot to tell you
something else, too.

714
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:17,748
I-I don't have any, uh...

715
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:20,918
- Are you protected?
- Oh, the hell with that!

716
00:43:21,526 --> 00:43:25,292
I'd like to get some prophylactics
or contraceptives.

717
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:28,026
Well, which would you like...
a prophylactic or a contraceptive?

718
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,161
Well, I just want...
What's for a man? A man?

719
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:35,673
Well, I mean, it depends on
what your situation is.

720
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:40,144
Well, what's the best thing
you have for right now...

721
00:43:40,212 --> 00:43:41,873
I mean,
for a man or for a woman?

722
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:43,505
What would be
the best thing that you'd have?

723
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,243
- For right now?
- Yeah, yeah.

724
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:46,306
This minute?

725
00:43:46,385 --> 00:43:48,546
Well, not this...
you know... well, you know...

726
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,611
Just a minute.
I've got something.

727
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:52,680
Something might happen.

728
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:58,429
Now, um, these are prophylactics.

729
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:01,933
Trojan, you see?
These are of quite fine quality.

730
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,265
I have them either in
unlubricated or lubricated.

731
00:44:05,337 --> 00:44:07,737
Uh, which is the better?
Which is the stronger?

732
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:09,967
Well, it depends, you know,
on what you like.

733
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:14,410
I'll demonstrate one for you.

734
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:19,947
Now, you see,
this is unlubricated.

735
00:44:20,018 --> 00:44:21,952
Yeah. I see. Yeah.

736
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,783
Is it strong, though?
Is the rubber...?

737
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:25,220
Oh, very, very good.
Here, see?

738
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,453
- It really is very durable.
- It's very strong.

739
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:31,462
No holes or anything. Gee, you can
see through it, as a matter of fact.

740
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,431
Yeah, it's very thin, for sensitivity.

741
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:36,262
Oh, and now for your wife, sir.

742
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:39,066
This just came to us
from Copenhagen.

743
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:42,436
This is a personal vibrator.
You see?

744
00:44:42,507 --> 00:44:46,910
It comes in three colors...
pink, light blue, or "natural."

745
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:51,312
Now, the batteries are in here.
They're included in the price.

746
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:56,484
- You mean this is for...?
- Marvelous?

747
00:44:56,555 --> 00:44:57,544
For a woman?

748
00:44:57,622 --> 00:45:00,216
Yes, a massage of the...
as you see on the box.

749
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,726
- You see?
- Oh!

750
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:04,421
For those hard-to-get-at places.

751
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:05,485
That's good.

752
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:08,658
This is Vagabond lotion.

753
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:11,931
See? Smell that.

754
00:45:13,405 --> 00:45:14,997
Isn't that...
isn't that marvelous?

755
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:17,338
Smells a little strange.

756
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:20,378
The thing about Vagabond is,
it has no bitter-tasting chemicals,

757
00:45:20,445 --> 00:45:22,174
so once you apply it, you see,

758
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:26,616
the alcohol
evaporates very quickly,

759
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:30,621
leaving a sweet residue
on the skin.

760
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:31,678
Oh, I see.

761
00:45:31,757 --> 00:45:34,191
As they advertise it,
"Suddenly you're delicious!"

762
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:32,611
What I did was,
I computed the time on my watch,

763
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:35,278
the 26-and-a-half minutes
that it would take me to seduce her.

764
00:46:35,353 --> 00:46:36,342
26-and-a-half?

765
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,116
Yeah, 26-and-a-half minutes,

766
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,215
and I set the camera
onto the clock radio,

767
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:41,691
and I had this red lightbulb...

768
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,160
Red lightbulb! I used to do that
when I was a kid.

769
00:46:44,229 --> 00:46:46,561
And the camera was on,
and I could see it from her apartment.

770
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:48,223
So, as you'll see now...

771
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,393
see, this is the preliminary stuff.

772
00:46:50,468 --> 00:46:51,958
- She's cute.
- Yeah, yeah.

773
00:46:52,037 --> 00:46:53,026
She a pro?

774
00:46:53,104 --> 00:46:55,197
Uh... well, I think she is,
as a matter of fact.

775
00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:56,865
But she's really great.

776
00:46:56,942 --> 00:47:00,969
See, what happens now is,
see, we go down for a few minutes.

777
00:47:01,046 --> 00:47:03,071
That's good.
You build up the ecstasy.

778
00:47:03,148 --> 00:47:04,877
Watch! We're gonna come up,
and I rip her clothes off!

779
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,645
It's fantastic. Great stuff.

780
00:47:06,718 --> 00:47:09,710
Should be up any second now.
Just take a second.

781
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,051
- It's, uh...
- Coming up soon, right?

782
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,286
Yeah, just... well...

783
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,294
What's going on here?
Where the hell are you?

784
00:47:21,366 --> 00:47:25,166
What the hell are you doing?
That's a $500 projector!

785
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:27,228
What the hell is that?

786
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:29,432
What are you,
some kind of genital freak? Huh?

787
00:47:29,507 --> 00:47:32,101
What is that?
Is that what I spent money for?

788
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:35,408
That's my Golden Fig Leaf Award,
right, from Anchorage, Alaska?

789
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,175
How many of them
do you think they give out?

790
00:47:37,249 --> 00:47:38,876
You dropped your sunglasses.

791
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,078
I'll drop 'em again!
Get out of here, you phony!

792
00:49:25,457 --> 00:49:27,584
She was different, she really was.

793
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:29,422
She just didn't know
what was going on at all.

794
00:49:29,494 --> 00:49:32,258
And she really thought
she <i>said</i> something.

795
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,060
Uh... excuse me, excuse me.

796
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:38,967
Uh, is this... you're casting
for that "be black" thing,

797
00:49:39,037 --> 00:49:41,005
for the police officer?

798
00:49:41,072 --> 00:49:42,596
<i>Be Black Baby,</i> that's right.

799
00:49:42,674 --> 00:49:44,869
Well, I'd like to try for it.

800
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,002
You don't look much
like a cop to me, man.

801
00:49:47,078 --> 00:49:49,103
Yeah, you look
kinda humble to me.

802
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,477
Well...

803
00:49:50,548 --> 00:49:53,278
I don't know, man,
if you've got pig in you,

804
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:55,444
we'll get it out of you,
so why don't you come on in?

805
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,579
- Door's over there.
- Okay.

806
00:50:02,927 --> 00:50:03,916
Hold up.

807
00:50:03,995 --> 00:50:06,395
We're gonna have you
run through a trial run,

808
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:08,625
you know, to kinda like
test your pig potential.

809
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,396
I'm willing to do whatever you want.
I can do anything, so, you know...

810
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:13,403
Whatever you want to do, I'm willing,

811
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:15,439
'cause I think I can play a cop.
Sure, I know I can.

812
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:17,634
Come on,
open that goddamn door!

813
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:19,472
We can't have any perverts here!

814
00:50:19,544 --> 00:50:21,842
What'd you say?

815
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:23,107
Huh? What'd you say?

816
00:50:23,181 --> 00:50:24,978
What do you mean?
That a friend of yours?

817
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,018
What are you protesting?
Let me see your permit.

818
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:28,450
You don't need a permit?

819
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,147
What do you mean?
What's that?

820
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:31,745
Against the war in Vietnam?

821
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:33,484
Let me tell you something, son,
you ever been in Vietnam?

822
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:36,356
Well, I have, and I know what it's like.
Oh, yeah, you know, huh?

823
00:50:36,428 --> 00:50:38,055
What are you, two years old,
you've been in the Army?

824
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:39,790
You haven't been in the Army
in high school.

825
00:50:39,864 --> 00:50:42,025
What? What did you say,
young lady?

826
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,728
"Make love, not war"?
Listen, I make love very well.

827
00:50:44,803 --> 00:50:47,795
What do you know about love?
What do you know about war?

828
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:50,602
Well, you want
a good slap in the face, huh?

829
00:50:50,675 --> 00:50:53,109
You won't even wear
a goddamn brassiere, you little slut.

830
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:55,237
Goddamn bitch. What?

831
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:58,111
What'd you say?
What are you gonna do about it?

832
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:00,674
Listen, son, I happen to know
that you don't have a permit here,

833
00:51:00,752 --> 00:51:02,447
so I'm gonna tell you something...

834
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,454
You just touch my bat?

835
00:51:04,522 --> 00:51:06,319
You touched my bat?

836
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:10,259
Come on, come out!
Gimme it! Come on!

837
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,037
Yeah.

838
00:51:35,086 --> 00:51:39,318
Listen, people, we want to
take you through the black experience,

839
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,223
and you all know that
being black means being loose.

840
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:45,353
- Being what?
- Being black means being loose.

841
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,261
And that's part of our history,

842
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:49,664
and what we want to do
is kind of loosen you up,

843
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:51,167
to more or less prepare you

844
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:53,500
for the experience that
we're about to take you through.

845
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:57,735
Okay, now, feel down
the arms to the hands.

846
00:51:57,809 --> 00:52:01,939
Slowly. You know.
We're gonna not rush anything.

847
00:52:03,515 --> 00:52:05,107
Touching the hands.

848
00:52:05,183 --> 00:52:07,310
Keep your arms clear.

849
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:11,287
Feel anything? Are you aware
of any differences?

850
00:52:11,356 --> 00:52:12,345
You know...?

851
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:16,258
- He's got a scar.
- A scar!

852
00:52:18,029 --> 00:52:20,395
- Carolyn is wearing her ring.
- I'm sorry!

853
00:52:20,465 --> 00:52:23,229
...then to the neck,
and then to the hair.

854
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:26,530
You feel any differences now?

855
00:52:26,604 --> 00:52:28,799
No, not the head.
Just feel the hair.

856
00:52:32,043 --> 00:52:35,638
- So this is a natural?
- Yes, it's very natural.

857
00:52:35,713 --> 00:52:37,647
It's very...
it's sort of springy, isn't it?

858
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:38,704
Like a sponge.

859
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,445
- It's like a sponge.
- It's like angel food cake.

860
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:43,919
- Is anyone else...?
- I had expected steel wool...

861
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:45,751
...but it's soft, and...

862
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:49,759
...to the left, back, right, forward...

863
00:52:49,827 --> 00:52:53,923
left, back, right, forward...

864
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:56,455
Okay?

865
00:52:56,534 --> 00:52:57,728
How are you doing over there?

866
00:52:57,802 --> 00:53:00,168
You're not doing anything!
Come on, move!

867
00:53:00,238 --> 00:53:03,002
Stop taking notes! You're
supposed to dance now. Come on.

868
00:53:03,074 --> 00:53:07,010
I have to review this
for <i>Eye</i> Magazine. I'm sorry.

869
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:09,171
- You're not touching. Come on.
- I don't want to touch.

870
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,908
You're supposed to.
Just keep going.

871
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:14,611
We're supposed to be...
we're supposed to relax, right?

872
00:53:14,686 --> 00:53:16,347
This is making me very nervous.

873
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:18,514
I'd rather not touch him.
I'd rather relax.

874
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,579
It's just a play.

875
00:53:19,657 --> 00:53:23,457
Right. You're participating in a play,
and this is part of your part.

876
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:26,122
But you're the actors.
We're the audience, honey.

877
00:53:26,197 --> 00:53:27,858
You're also an actor in this case.

878
00:53:27,932 --> 00:53:30,264
We're just not sure of the point
of this whole thing.

879
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:31,324
We're trying.

880
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:33,734
- Well, come on, let's just do it.
- Right. Okay.

881
00:53:33,805 --> 00:53:37,263
Forward, side, back, side...

882
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:39,640
Now, in order to <i>be</i> black
and to <i>feel</i> black,

883
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,338
you've got to <i>eat</i> black,

884
00:53:41,412 --> 00:53:43,346
and we have here for you today,

885
00:53:43,414 --> 00:53:46,406
through the kindness
of sister Carolyn here,

886
00:53:46,484 --> 00:53:48,179
who was kind enough
to whip it up for us,

887
00:53:48,253 --> 00:53:51,416
some of the best in soul food...

888
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:53,616
black-eyed peas...

889
00:53:54,692 --> 00:53:57,422
pig feet, and greens.

890
00:53:57,495 --> 00:53:58,655
Collard greens.

891
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,561
And here we go, right for you.

892
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:04,324
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

893
00:54:04,402 --> 00:54:06,870
That's enough, that's enough.
No, that's good.

894
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:09,102
Mr. Paul.

895
00:54:09,173 --> 00:54:10,572
No, no, no. No, no, no.

896
00:54:10,642 --> 00:54:13,270
- No, no, you have to eat it.
- I don't have to eat that, no, no.

897
00:54:18,683 --> 00:54:20,776
Don't look at it like that.
You're supposed to eat it.

898
00:54:20,852 --> 00:54:24,515
Taste it! Why don't you want it?
Is something wrong with it?

899
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:26,420
- What's wrong with it?
- What's the matter?

900
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:28,516
That's the food we eat.

901
00:54:28,593 --> 00:54:30,424
We got to dish out some stuff
for the brother up here.

902
00:54:30,495 --> 00:54:32,190
He doesn't even have any!

903
00:54:32,263 --> 00:54:34,026
I done told you,
I don't care for any.

904
00:54:34,098 --> 00:54:35,622
- Open your mouth.
- I really...

905
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,100
No, no. Now, you really must.
You really must. Thank you.

906
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:41,696
Okay. That's some beans for you.
Now you need some greens.

907
00:54:41,773 --> 00:54:43,968
- Wait a minute.
- Chew it. Swallow it.

908
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:45,566
- Chew it and say, "Mmm!"
- It's good!

909
00:54:45,643 --> 00:54:47,304
Go ahead, swallow it, swallow it.

910
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:49,346
Oh, there's something...
wait a minute.

911
00:54:50,948 --> 00:54:52,882
Oh, yeah, okay, that's all right.

912
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,145
Would you eat...
hurry up and eat, man?

913
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:56,208
Yeah, I will.

914
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:57,879
You didn't eat
none of your meat, man.

915
00:54:57,955 --> 00:54:59,946
The sooner you finish,
the sooner you get to the show.

916
00:55:00,024 --> 00:55:02,015
Right. All of this is what you eat.
All of that.

917
00:55:02,093 --> 00:55:03,720
That stuff... eat it, man.

918
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:09,962
You know, you're supposed to be
so pro-us, then eat us, you understand?

919
00:55:10,034 --> 00:55:12,832
There it is, right there. Eat it.

920
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:14,735
- Excuse me.
- Eat it, man.

921
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:17,274
- I really...
- Well, <i>eat it,</i> man!

922
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:19,902
I mean, this is
the black experience. Eat it.

923
00:55:19,977 --> 00:55:21,308
Thank you.

924
00:55:21,545 --> 00:55:23,638
You all have, uh...
you're just about ready for the show.

925
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:25,306
Yeah, you're just about ready.

926
00:55:25,383 --> 00:55:27,214
You've tasted black,
you've danced black,

927
00:55:27,284 --> 00:55:29,514
and you've felt black,
and now you've got to <i>be</i> black

928
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:32,249
in order to truly know what it is
to have the black experience.

929
00:55:32,323 --> 00:55:34,655
Okay, so you come on up here,
and we're gonna do you up.

930
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:36,818
- Oh, look!
- I'm gonna take care of you.

931
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:39,021
Okay, you look great.

932
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,495
Well, you know, you're a bit negroish,
so we get to put some on you.

933
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,128
Now I can be black on the outside.

934
00:55:48,205 --> 00:55:50,002
- Yeah, well, you know.
- No, no.

935
00:55:50,074 --> 00:55:52,838
- You must. Lady, lady...
- It's gonna ruin my makeup!

936
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,243
<i>...</i>it's part of the experience.
- Don't. Oh!

937
00:55:56,313 --> 00:55:59,578
- Come on! It's all...!
- It's all part of it.

938
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:01,345
Close your eyes
before you get it in your eyes.

939
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:02,750
Don't get it in my hair.

940
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,152
Okay, I won't get it in your hair,
your pretty blonde hair.

941
00:56:05,222 --> 00:56:07,588
- Don't rub it in.
- I won't, I won't.

942
00:56:07,658 --> 00:56:08,955
Close your mouth.

943
00:56:09,026 --> 00:56:12,154
Oh, this is senseless, just senseless.

944
00:56:12,229 --> 00:56:13,321
No, it's not.

945
00:56:13,397 --> 00:56:14,557
Yeah.

946
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:16,691
You know, the next thing we do,
now that you are black,

947
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:19,531
as white people, we want to
kinda get to know you better,

948
00:56:19,603 --> 00:56:21,798
'cause you know all white people
want to get to know black people.

949
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:23,305
Is that right? That's right.

950
00:56:23,374 --> 00:56:24,898
Now, we want to kinda
get to know you better

951
00:56:24,975 --> 00:56:26,033
and kinda socialize with you

952
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,305
and kinda understand
what you're about, black people,

953
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:30,006
see, because we're white
and you're black.

954
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,775
- We're black now?
- That's right.

955
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:33,441
You look black. Look at us.
You see?

956
00:56:33,517 --> 00:56:35,644
So we want to kinda get
into your personal lives,

957
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:37,152
you know, just to be friendly.

958
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:38,518
Oh, I think I have enough.

959
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:39,954
So, why don't we kinda break up

960
00:56:40,024 --> 00:56:42,822
and get to know each other,
the individual people, okay?

961
00:56:42,893 --> 00:56:45,487
Yeah, my name is
John Dillinger, you understand.

962
00:56:45,563 --> 00:56:47,030
- Hello.
- How you doing?

963
00:56:47,097 --> 00:56:48,189
- Paul Vymil.
- Right.

964
00:56:48,265 --> 00:56:50,096
Now, listen,
do you have any I.D. On you?

965
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:51,498
Any "idea" on me?

966
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:52,831
No, I.D.
Identification.

967
00:56:52,903 --> 00:56:55,565
- Yes, in my wallet.
- Could I see it for a second?

968
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:58,005
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Manhasset.

969
00:56:58,075 --> 00:57:00,543
From Manhasset?
Yeah, what do you do now?

970
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:02,670
Well, I'm a housewife.

971
00:57:02,746 --> 00:57:04,646
A housewife?
Do you have any children?

972
00:57:04,715 --> 00:57:05,704
No.

973
00:57:05,783 --> 00:57:07,842
You don't?
You gonna have some soon?

974
00:57:07,918 --> 00:57:11,183
Well, we're, uh...
we're planning.

975
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:13,485
I mean, we're in
a family-planning group.

976
00:57:13,557 --> 00:57:16,685
Oh, how exciting.
How very, very interesting.

977
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,854
Why don't you let me take your purse
for you for the rest of the show,

978
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,125
because we're going to
go on up to a new level,

979
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:25,293
and I'm going to take
good care of it downstairs, okay?

980
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:28,236
And you don't want to carry this
heavy thing around with you all day.

981
00:57:28,305 --> 00:57:31,934
Why don't you just go on upstairs,
and we'll be right with you, all right?

982
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:34,671
Yeah, why don't you just
go on upstairs now.

983
00:57:34,745 --> 00:57:35,734
Well...

984
00:57:36,947 --> 00:57:38,812
They didn't take <i>her</i> purse!

985
00:57:39,884 --> 00:57:40,976
Lady.

986
00:57:42,052 --> 00:57:44,145
Hey, would you like
to join us? Come on!

987
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:49,382
Uh, what...?
She... she took my purse,

988
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,293
and she didn't take her purse,
and I would like my purse back.

989
00:57:52,363 --> 00:57:53,694
Oh, no, that's silly.

990
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:55,493
- Did they take your purse?
- They didn't really?

991
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:57,033
She said they were
doing it to everybody,

992
00:57:57,101 --> 00:58:00,559
but I'm the only one that it happened to,
and I don't like that.

993
00:58:00,638 --> 00:58:02,833
It's downstairs.
It's downstairs, okay?

994
00:58:02,907 --> 00:58:04,602
- Well, l...
- I think l...

995
00:58:04,675 --> 00:58:06,006
She took it.

996
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:07,839
She took my...
she said every...

997
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:10,244
she took everyb...
she said everybody was doing it.

998
00:58:10,314 --> 00:58:11,645
Why don't you go down
and find it for her?

999
00:58:11,715 --> 00:58:14,081
Why don't you go down with her?
I think she's a little bit upset.

1000
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:16,244
Joe, I think you should go down.

1001
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,015
Well, I think somebody
oughtta go get it.

1002
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:19,350
I don't want to go down.

1003
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:22,551
- Well, listen, it's just part of the play.
- It's not funny!

1004
00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:24,059
Well, it's just
part of the play, that's all.

1005
00:58:24,128 --> 00:58:26,790
I looked in my wallet,
all of my money is gone.

1006
00:58:26,864 --> 00:58:29,389
- Joe, go down.
- I'm sure it's part of the play, but...

1007
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:31,457
It is. It's just part of the play.

1008
00:58:31,535 --> 00:58:33,469
- Go down.
- It's not funny.

1009
00:58:33,537 --> 00:58:35,129
No, I don't want you
to walk down with me.

1010
00:58:35,205 --> 00:58:37,867
- We'll go together. Come on.
- Well, you <i>should</i> go.

1011
00:58:37,942 --> 00:58:40,137
Speak to the director.
I'm sure you'll get it back.

1012
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,643
I'm going right behind you, Joe.

1013
00:58:41,712 --> 00:58:43,737
Just stay there.
Stay with the girl.

1014
00:58:43,814 --> 00:58:46,612
Stay here.
Stay and talk to her. All right?

1015
00:58:46,684 --> 00:58:49,482
I'm perfectly capable
of going down by myself.

1016
00:59:06,236 --> 00:59:10,172
If anything happens, come right back...
if anything happens.

1017
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,266
I-I'm sure it's just part of the play.
Don't worry about it.

1018
00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:15,869
Joe, don't get hostile. Be nice.

1019
00:59:16,947 --> 00:59:18,608
I won't get hostile.

1020
00:59:20,751 --> 00:59:23,049
There's...
there's a number of people.

1021
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,554
They're just kidding around.
You can hear them laughing.

1022
00:59:25,623 --> 00:59:28,319
Um... excuse me.

1023
00:59:28,392 --> 00:59:30,155
- Excuse me.
- Right.

1024
00:59:30,227 --> 00:59:32,559
Hi. Would you like to
come in for a second, man?

1025
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,063
Sure. Sure.

1026
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:40,859
Wait a second!

1027
00:59:40,938 --> 00:59:42,405
Somebody do something, will you?

1028
00:59:42,473 --> 00:59:45,135
- It's part of the play!
- It's not part of the play!

1029
00:59:45,209 --> 00:59:46,608
Somebody do something!

1030
00:59:46,677 --> 00:59:48,304
Listen, they didn't really hurt him.

1031
00:59:48,379 --> 00:59:50,142
I still haven't got my money,
she hasn't got her bag.

1032
00:59:50,214 --> 00:59:52,148
- It's no joke, huh?
- It's just part of the performance.

1033
00:59:52,216 --> 00:59:53,808
Oh, some performance.
Where's his money?

1034
00:59:53,884 --> 00:59:54,873
I don't know what to do.

1035
00:59:54,952 --> 00:59:57,443
Listen, this happens
every performance.

1036
00:59:57,521 --> 00:59:59,512
- Oh, we'll get it later, then.
- All right.

1037
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,581
Come on, let's go up
to the next stage. Come on.

1038
01:00:01,659 --> 01:00:03,490
I'm not gonna go in there,
that's for sure.

1039
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,391
- Well, that's, you know...
- All right.

1040
01:00:08,532 --> 01:00:10,500
Where's the theat...?
Well, where's he gonna be?

1041
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:12,865
Well, he'll meet you
after the performance.

1042
01:00:12,936 --> 01:00:14,233
Hey, lady!

1043
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:16,228
You.

1044
01:00:16,306 --> 01:00:17,705
You, come up here.

1045
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:20,870
I'm talking to you.
I said get up here.

1046
01:00:20,944 --> 01:00:21,933
Go ahead.

1047
01:00:22,012 --> 01:00:24,242
Yeah, the one with
the stupid look on her face.

1048
01:00:24,314 --> 01:00:26,976
Yeah, in the green coat.

1049
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:29,383
You, Miss Blondie. Get up here.

1050
01:00:29,453 --> 01:00:31,080
- I'd like my purse back.
- She's not a blonde!

1051
01:00:31,155 --> 01:00:34,283
She's a nigger with blonde hair.
Get the fuck up here, lady.

1052
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:36,553
Get up here, now! You hear?

1053
01:00:36,627 --> 01:00:38,959
- What the hell is going on here?
- Shut up, mister.

1054
01:00:39,029 --> 01:00:40,792
- Hey, take it easy.
- Are you kidding or something?

1055
01:00:40,864 --> 01:00:42,957
I don't want you
to talk to me like that.

1056
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:45,627
I didn't ask you nothing.
I said get up here.

1057
01:00:45,703 --> 01:00:48,797
Now, I want all of you up here now,
'cause we're gonna go through

1058
01:00:48,872 --> 01:00:50,965
something that you been
waiting for, niggers.

1059
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:52,941
I'd like to go to the theater.

1060
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,308
Yeah, I think you want to go.
Now, get up here!

1061
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:57,142
All of you, get up here!

1062
01:00:57,214 --> 01:01:00,479
Okay, mother fuckers, move! Now!

1063
01:01:00,551 --> 01:01:02,143
Oh, my God,
I think he's got a gun!

1064
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:04,585
That's right, it's a gun and it kills.

1065
01:01:04,655 --> 01:01:05,849
Now, move!

1066
01:01:05,923 --> 01:01:07,652
Come on, fatso, move!

1067
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:09,249
You still think
that guy was a plant?

1068
01:01:09,326 --> 01:01:12,853
You stand over here, lady.
Stand over there.

1069
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,660
Now, all of you get up here.
You gonna follow a little routine here.

1070
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:17,098
I know you're gonna like it.

1071
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:19,829
Get on up here. All you niggers
like to do what I got in mind.

1072
01:01:19,903 --> 01:01:22,929
Get up here. All of you.
Get the fuck over there.

1073
01:01:23,006 --> 01:01:25,065
Get up...
I said get up here!

1074
01:01:25,142 --> 01:01:27,474
Don't give me no hard time!

1075
01:01:27,544 --> 01:01:29,569
Which one you want, huh?

1076
01:01:29,646 --> 01:01:31,773
Let's see... the blackest one.

1077
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:33,180
Take any nigger you want.

1078
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,616
I'll take the one
with the sunglasses on.

1079
01:01:35,686 --> 01:01:38,154
Take this nigger over here.

1080
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:42,124
I don't care. Hey, man.
Hey, baby, which one you want?

1081
01:01:42,192 --> 01:01:43,853
Hey, man, which one you want?

1082
01:01:43,927 --> 01:01:44,916
Come on!

1083
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:46,963
All right, take anyone you want.

1084
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,861
We're gonna go through
a little screwing scene here.

1085
01:01:48,932 --> 01:01:50,957
We know all you niggers
know how to screw, right?

1086
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:54,629
Hey, baby, lay down
on the fucking mattress, man.

1087
01:01:54,705 --> 01:01:58,004
I said lay down
on the mattress, mister.

1088
01:01:58,075 --> 01:01:59,406
This is ridiculous.

1089
01:02:00,811 --> 01:02:03,143
Wait. You ain't going no place.

1090
01:02:03,213 --> 01:02:04,578
Stop this!

1091
01:02:05,149 --> 01:02:06,639
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

1092
01:02:08,552 --> 01:02:10,315
Lay down and shut up.

1093
01:02:10,387 --> 01:02:11,376
Shut up, lady.

1094
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,979
I think this is going a bit too far.

1095
01:02:13,056 --> 01:02:15,422
Shut up, pig. Don't say nothing.

1096
01:02:15,492 --> 01:02:17,483
- All of you lay down.
- Get up from her.

1097
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:18,550
This is going too far.

1098
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:21,928
Man, if you don't lay down, I'm gonna
bust you in your fucking head!

1099
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:24,160
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

1100
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:25,323
Stop it!

1101
01:02:30,507 --> 01:02:31,997
All right, all right, get back!

1102
01:02:37,347 --> 01:02:39,645
Right. Get down there.

1103
01:02:39,716 --> 01:02:41,047
Go on!

1104
01:02:42,052 --> 01:02:44,020
Go on! You, too!
Get down there!

1105
01:02:45,189 --> 01:02:46,178
Come on!

1106
01:02:49,193 --> 01:02:50,182
Come on!

1107
01:02:53,597 --> 01:02:55,792
- Let's go. Let's go.
- You okay?

1108
01:02:55,866 --> 01:02:58,266
Listen, I know where the exit is.
We can get the elevator upstairs.

1109
01:02:58,335 --> 01:02:59,802
Let's go.

1110
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:01,360
Come on, everybody upstairs.

1111
01:03:01,438 --> 01:03:03,269
- Lead the way up here?
- Yeah, go ahead.

1112
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,308
Just go up
and go up the stairs. Next flight.

1113
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:06,637
...the elevator.

1114
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,543
Let's go.
Let's just go. I don't...

1115
01:03:10,547 --> 01:03:12,310
Let's get out of here, you guys.

1116
01:03:12,382 --> 01:03:13,906
Come on. You guys, too.

1117
01:03:13,984 --> 01:03:14,973
Hurry up.

1118

1119
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:21,786
- Oh, my God. You okay?
- Oh, let's get out of here.

1120
01:03:21,859 --> 01:03:23,326
We are.
We're on the way out now.

1121
01:03:23,393 --> 01:03:25,088
- Get the thing going, huh?
- Can you get it going?

1122
01:03:25,162 --> 01:03:26,993
- Huh?
- Please?

1123
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:28,861
Oh, we're out of this place.

1124
01:03:29,867 --> 01:03:31,357
- Hurry!
- Can you start it?

1125
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:35,202
- Oh, my God.
- We're climbing out of this place.

1126
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:38,330
Okay.

1127
01:03:42,346 --> 01:03:43,938
Hey! The lights!

1128
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:46,005
- What's going on now?

1129
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,277
Come on, you cocksuckers...!

01:03:54,591 --> 01:03:57,116
- Get back.
- Okay, niggers, cut the noise out.

1133
01:03:57,194 --> 01:03:59,025
Cut the noise out.

1134
01:03:59,096 --> 01:04:00,723
All right, get that camera off there.

1135
01:04:01,732 --> 01:04:04,599
- Get that camera down!

No, not that one!
Not her, not her!

No, not that one,
not that one. Hold it. Hold it.

1139
01:04:13,377 --> 01:04:14,639
- This one?

1140
01:04:14,711 --> 01:04:17,339
- Just leave her alone.

1141
01:04:18,348 --> 01:04:20,646
Get your hands off her!
I'll blow your fucking head off!

1142
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:24,244
Stop! Please stop!

01:04:26,823 --> 01:04:28,882
All right. Stay back!

1144

Turn that fucking camera off!
Turn it off! Get it down!

1145
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:36,162
Get that camera down!

1148
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:50,269
Stay back there, or I'll

01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,341
Oh, my hair!

1151
01:04:58,355 --> 01:05:01,882
- You want to see something?
- How you like that?

1152
01:05:01,959 --> 01:05:03,620
Stay there!

1153
01:05:03,694 --> 01:05:06,162
Oh, God!

Be black, baby, be black!

01:07:38,882 --> 01:07:40,713
Outta sight? All right!

01:07:40,784 --> 01:07:43,480
Be black, baby!
Be black, baby!

1218
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:46,317
Be black! Be black!
Remember, now.

1219
01:07:46,389 --> 01:07:48,653
Be black, now, okay?

1220
01:07:48,725 --> 01:07:50,886

- Was that in good taste?
- Yeah.

1230

Well, Clive...
Clive Barnes was really right.

1231

That was some experience!

It was a great, great show.
Great theater.

I'm gonna tell all my friends
they've got to come.

They've all really got to come.

Except they should have called it...

1236
01:08:25,028 --> 01:08:26,620

1240
01:08:31,234 --> 01:08:32,861
It was magnificent,

I'm tickled I came.

1242
01:08:34,004 --> 01:08:37,963
It made you feel
what it felt like to be a Negro.

1243
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:40,532
I mean, it really gave you the...
to be black.

1244
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,306
It really makes you
stop and think, really.

1245
01:08:45,048 --> 01:08:50,315
Certainly I've worried
about the problems,

1246
01:08:50,387 --> 01:08:52,981

you could almost say
the sicknesses in our society.

1248
01:08:55,959 --> 01:08:59,451
But it was invigorating.

1249
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:03,761
It was...
I-I find it hard to think!

1250
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:05,664
Listen to that stupid shit!

1251

Oh, man, fuck them, you know.

Met has great offices

1340
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:01,233
That reminds me,
the other day I sold a policy

1341
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:03,005
to Harry Jameson.

1342
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:04,512
He's kind of a friend of mine,

1343
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,912
and he told my supervisor,
Joe McMann,

1344
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:11,181
he told Joe about my style
and how well I sold the policy,

1345
01:17:11,254 --> 01:17:14,018
and he said that Joe
seemed a little nervous,

1346
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:17,116
as if I was doing too well,
you know.

1347
01:17:17,193 --> 01:17:19,559
Thought maybe I was
bucking for his position.

1348
01:17:19,629 --> 01:17:22,223
- I think he was right.
- He's jealous!

1349
01:17:22,298 --> 01:17:23,663
You keep up the good work, honey.

1350
01:17:23,733 --> 01:17:25,724
You keep it up.
You're a real plugger.

1351
01:17:30,406 --> 01:17:31,395
Oh, honey!

1352
01:17:31,474 --> 01:17:32,463
Yeah?

1353
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:34,533
Did you think about
what I asked you?

1354
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,942
- What's that?
- About the dishwasher.

1355
01:17:37,013 --> 01:17:38,571
Oh, yeah, I did think about that.

1356
01:17:38,648 --> 01:17:41,173
I was just selling a policy
to someone out on Staten Island,

1357
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,411
and he had
a beautiful washer for $90,

1358
01:17:43,486 --> 01:17:45,750
and he sort of implied
that if I didn't buy the washer,

1359
01:17:45,822 --> 01:17:48,382
he wouldn't take the policy,
he'd buy it from Prudential.

1360
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,653
Oh, honey, I don't want
a secondhand washer.

1361
01:17:50,727 --> 01:17:54,094
I don't want something everybody else
has put their dirty old dishes in.

1362
01:17:54,163 --> 01:17:56,188
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

1363
01:17:56,265 --> 01:17:59,200
It's a very good one, and we can't afford
to get anything better at this point.

1364
01:17:59,268 --> 01:18:01,930
I mean, it's better than
buying one for $300 or $400.

1365
01:18:02,004 --> 01:18:03,096
We have too many payments.

1366
01:18:03,172 --> 01:18:05,504
We have the car payments,
we have this rug that <i>you</i> bought.

1367
01:18:05,575 --> 01:18:07,475
What color is it?
Did you ever think of that?

1368
01:18:07,543 --> 01:18:09,807
- My kitchen happens to be yellow.
- It's white.

1369
01:18:09,879 --> 01:18:12,177
White?! I don't want
a white dishwasher!

1370
01:18:12,248 --> 01:18:13,875
Everybody has 'em!

1371
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:16,942
Oh, come on, honey,
I want it to match the kitchen.

1372
01:18:17,019 --> 01:18:19,180
So what color do you want?

1373
01:18:19,255 --> 01:18:20,688
I want yellow.

1374
01:18:20,757 --> 01:18:23,089
Oh, now, listen, we can get
a yellow one in a few years.

1375
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:25,093
Oh, honey, you just never
think about those things.

1376
01:18:25,161 --> 01:18:27,095
You don't know anything
about kitchens.

1377
01:18:27,163 --> 01:18:28,790
- Don't worry, it'll work out...
- Honey!

1378
01:18:28,865 --> 01:18:31,231
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

1379
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,291
I feel something.

1380
01:18:33,369 --> 01:18:34,529
Are you okay?

1381
01:18:34,604 --> 01:18:36,595
It's too much for me.
I just can't take it.

1382
01:18:36,672 --> 01:18:38,799
- Just take it easy. Don't worry.
- I just can't take all this housework...

1383
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,809
...and all the cooking
and all the laundry and everything.

1384
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:42,139
It's just too much for me.

1385
01:18:42,211 --> 01:18:44,645
- Okay. Don't worry.
- I'm just exhausted!

1386
01:18:44,714 --> 01:18:46,511
- Look, look. Okay...
- I can't handle it.

1387
01:18:46,582 --> 01:18:48,482
All right, all right.
Now, look, from now on,

1388
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:50,917
from now on,
I'm gonna do everything.

1389
01:18:50,987 --> 01:18:52,818
I'm gonna call the agency right away.

1390
01:18:52,889 --> 01:18:55,483
We're gonna get some colored help.
It's very cheap. We can afford it.

1391
01:18:55,558 --> 01:18:56,855
I'm gonna borrow on the policy.

1392
01:18:56,926 --> 01:18:59,019
Nothing is more important
than our child, do you understand?

1393
01:18:59,095 --> 01:19:00,255
Oh, honey.

1394
01:19:00,329 --> 01:19:02,194
- Nothing. Don't worry...
- What about me?

1395
01:19:04,901 --> 01:19:06,892
Oh, he really kicked, honey.

1396
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:09,199
Did he really? Yeah?
Let me listen.

1397
01:19:09,272 --> 01:19:10,603
Don't press so!

1398
01:19:11,908 --> 01:19:14,240
I'm not pressing.
It's my child, honey.

1399
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:16,005
I can't hear anything, though.

1400
01:19:16,078 --> 01:19:17,568
Can't hear anything?

1401
01:19:17,647 --> 01:19:20,172
Well, stop pressing so hard!
You're gonna kill the kid!

1402
01:19:20,249 --> 01:19:22,945
You almost gave me a miscarriage,
carrying me over here!

1403
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:25,453
Okay, okay. Take it easy, honey.
You're very excited now.

1404
01:19:25,521 --> 01:19:27,819
You're very excitable.
I'm gonna call the doctor right now.

1405
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,949
I'm gonna do all the work.
You're not gonna do anything.

1406
01:19:30,026 --> 01:19:31,823
I'm gonna work
until we get a maid, okay?

1407
01:19:31,894 --> 01:19:34,328
Now, just take it easy. I'm gonna
take the laundry out now, okay?

1408
01:19:34,397 --> 01:19:36,957
Now, take it easy.
All right, I'll be right back.

1409
01:21:02,752 --> 01:21:04,845
<i>And now, from our studios</i>
<i>in New York,</i>

1410
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:07,651
<i>the</i> Now News
with John Winnicove.

1411
01:21:08,891 --> 01:21:11,951
This is John Winnicove
with the evening report.

1412
01:21:12,028 --> 01:21:16,658
This afternoon, I stood on
the former site of the Community Co-op.

1413
01:21:16,732 --> 01:21:18,962
As you know,
the building was completely leveled

1414
01:21:19,035 --> 01:21:21,595
by an explosion last Friday night.

1415
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:23,434
Over the past few days,

1416
01:21:23,506 --> 01:21:25,838
the police and special agents
of the FBI

1417
01:21:25,908 --> 01:21:29,571
have discovered that the explosion
emanated from the laundry room,

1418
01:21:29,645 --> 01:21:32,205
and are even now
sifting through the rubble

1419
01:21:32,281 --> 01:21:34,977
in an effort to determine
the cause or causes

1420
01:21:35,051 --> 01:21:37,042
or person or persons

1421
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:41,180
responsible for this
truly horrible holocaust.

1422
01:21:41,257 --> 01:21:43,122
This afternoon
we were on the scene,

1423
01:21:43,192 --> 01:21:46,787
speaking with relatives
of former tenants and friends,

1424
01:21:46,862 --> 01:21:48,727
and we switch to that report now.

1425
01:21:48,798 --> 01:21:50,026
Avery Gunnz.

1426
01:21:50,099 --> 01:21:53,694
I-I don't live in the building,
but I was on my way...

1427
01:21:53,769 --> 01:21:55,703
I-I was visiting
my sister last night,

1428
01:21:55,771 --> 01:21:57,739
and I left my wallet there,

1429
01:21:57,807 --> 01:21:59,570
and I'm really upset.

1430
01:21:59,642 --> 01:22:01,974
I had my driver's license
and my credit cards,

1431
01:22:02,044 --> 01:22:04,035
and I don't know what to do.

1432
01:22:04,113 --> 01:22:05,307
It's a terrible thing.

1433
01:22:05,381 --> 01:22:07,178
- You think it's a good thing, sir?
- Yes, I think it's a good thing.

1434
01:22:07,249 --> 01:22:09,080
I think a lot of people
have dogs in this neighborhood.

1435
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:11,051
I think we'll be able
to walk our dogs now.

1436
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,781
I think we need more room like this.

1437
01:22:12,855 --> 01:22:14,982
Well, now, you weren't
a resident here, obviously.

1438
01:22:15,057 --> 01:22:16,752
No, I'm not a resident,
but we need more...

1439
01:22:16,826 --> 01:22:18,589
A lot of these things
are going to be happening.

1440
01:22:18,661 --> 01:22:20,094
They're doing quite a bit of this,

1441
01:22:20,162 --> 01:22:23,325
and I think they'll be blowing them up
faster than they can build 'em.

1442
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:25,560
I live in that red house
across the street,

1443
01:22:25,634 --> 01:22:27,226
and I can see from my window.

1444
01:22:27,303 --> 01:22:29,328
I can see all the entries
that were here.

1445
01:22:29,405 --> 01:22:31,930
Strange people always
walking in and out,

1446
01:22:32,008 --> 01:22:33,532
all hours of the night and day.

1447
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:34,598
All the time.

1448
01:22:34,677 --> 01:22:37,475
I see. So you attribute it to
someone who's just walking in and out.

1449
01:22:37,546 --> 01:22:40,413
- Some funny person did this.
- Funny person. I see.

1450
01:22:40,483 --> 01:22:41,950
- Sir, did you have an opinion?
- Yes.

1451
01:22:42,018 --> 01:22:44,452
- What is your name?
- Joe. Dr. Joe King.

1452
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,010
- Dr. King, you say?
- Yeah. Right.

1453
01:22:46,088 --> 01:22:48,852
- A doctor of medicine?
- I'm a psychiatrist, yeah.

1454
01:22:48,924 --> 01:22:50,551
Would you like to turn
right to the camera here

1455
01:22:50,626 --> 01:22:52,457
so we could face the camera?

1456
01:22:52,528 --> 01:22:55,190
Now, Dr. King, what are
your feelings about this?

1457
01:22:55,264 --> 01:22:58,461
Well, you know, it probably
is the result of somebody

1458
01:22:58,534 --> 01:23:02,334
who cracked under
the pressures of our society.

1459
01:23:02,405 --> 01:23:07,069
You know, we have such
intense materialistic pressures,

1460
01:23:07,143 --> 01:23:09,737
and there's such a tremendous gap

1461
01:23:09,812 --> 01:23:12,406
between those who make it
and those who don't.

1462
01:23:12,481 --> 01:23:15,143
And you feel most definitely
that that frustration

1463
01:23:15,217 --> 01:23:17,481
is the kind of thing
that is taken out here.

1464
01:23:17,553 --> 01:23:18,713
It's the kind of thing...

1465
01:23:18,788 --> 01:23:20,983
We're raised on violence
in America, you know?

1466
01:23:21,057 --> 01:23:25,084
People are... all these toy guns,
and the war in Vietnam...

1467
01:23:25,161 --> 01:23:28,426
- Excuse me, sir.
- Excuse me, what is your name?

1468
01:23:28,497 --> 01:23:32,092
My name is Jon Rubin, sir,
and I just came back from Vietnam.

1469
01:23:32,168 --> 01:23:34,796
I spent 18 months over there,
and I'd just like to say that...

1470
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:37,236
What were you doing over there?
Would you mind telling us what...?

1471
01:23:37,306 --> 01:23:39,274
I happen to be a demolition expert.

1472
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:42,276
You might be able
to give us some clue.

1473
01:23:42,344 --> 01:23:43,868
We've been trying to determine the...

1474
01:23:43,946 --> 01:23:46,278
As a matter of fact,
I was noticing this building,

1475
01:23:46,348 --> 01:23:49,283
getting away from that,
and it looks like a pretty good job.

1476
01:23:49,351 --> 01:23:51,114
Uh, you know, I hate to say it,

1477
01:23:51,187 --> 01:23:54,179
but it looks like it was
done by an expert, at least.

1478
01:23:54,256 --> 01:23:56,588
I'd just like to say, sir,
I'm just sick of this...

1479
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:59,821
- Well, please, we're on the air.
- Sorry, sir, that's the way I feel.

1480
01:23:59,895 --> 01:24:01,760
I'm just kinda annoyed

1481
01:24:01,831 --> 01:24:05,130
about the fact that, well,
I just come back from Vietnam

1482
01:24:05,201 --> 01:24:08,295
after we kinda, you know,
sweep up the country there.

1483
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,463
We've got 500,000 men over there,

1484
01:24:10,539 --> 01:24:12,564
and then we come back
to this country, and what do we see?

1485
01:24:12,641 --> 01:24:16,304
We see some kind of mess
on the floor, and people killed...

1486
01:24:16,378 --> 01:24:18,039
I mean, a fellow like this
has never seen any...

1487
01:24:18,114 --> 01:24:19,877
You haven't seen any action.
You ever been in the Army?

1488
01:24:19,949 --> 01:24:21,974
You ever been over in Korea
or Vietnam or in the Second War?

1489
01:24:22,051 --> 01:24:23,712
You haven't seen what I've seen.

1490
01:24:23,786 --> 01:24:27,449
I've seen arms shot off.
I've seen faces blown up.

1491
01:24:27,523 --> 01:24:29,855
- I've seen... taken off.
- Hey.

1492
01:24:29,925 --> 01:24:33,258
I'm sick of all that...
I'm sick of all that...

1493
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:34,990
Excuse me, please, we have to...

1494
01:24:35,064 --> 01:24:36,053
I'm sorry.

1495
01:24:36,132 --> 01:24:37,690
We have to...
I-I don't mean to push you,

1496
01:24:37,766 --> 01:24:39,461
but we have to get off the air now.

1497
01:24:39,535 --> 01:24:41,901
Do you have anything
you might just like to say in summary?

1498
01:24:41,971 --> 01:24:44,940
Well, I would like
to say something, if you don't mind.

1499
01:24:45,007 --> 01:24:46,065
No, of course not.

1500
01:24:46,142 --> 01:24:48,110
I'd like to say hello to my mother,
if you don't mind.

1501
01:24:48,177 --> 01:24:49,508
Uh... of course.

1502
01:24:49,578 --> 01:24:51,136
Thank you. Hi, Ma!
