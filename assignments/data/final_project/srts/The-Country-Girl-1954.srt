1
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,425
Here's your coffee, Bernie.

2
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:57,139
Coffee, Mr. Cook?

3
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:06,638
If we're going to discuss this,
let's discuss it,

4
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,902
but don't sit there and pout
as if I'd just taken away your tricycle.

5
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:12,394
I'm not pouting.
I just happen to disagree with you.

6
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:13,781
But Frank Elgin...

7
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,314
Why not let the doorman read
for the part?

8
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:17,857
Phil, look at some facts.

9
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:19,787
We've been in rehearsal for five days.

10
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,153
Our leading man, to put it mildly,
was dreadful.

11
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:25,073
Now, maybe that was my fault.
Maybe I was the wrong director for him.

12
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:27,158
At any rate, we let him go yesterday.

13
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,786
As of this morning,
we do not have a replacement.

14
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:33,748
We open in Boston on the 28th.
We are in trouble.

15
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:36,293
And I can do without the sarcasm, too.

16
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:39,838
Cookie, look, all I'm saying is
let me audition him for you.

17
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:44,009
Phil, after all, there's no harm done
in giving the man a reading.

18
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,938
No. I agree with you.

19
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:50,515
But when I wanted to read Ray Watson,
that was just a big waste of time.

20
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:51,891
And he's a much better actor than Elgin.

21
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:54,269
I know a lot of guys
who can act better than Elgin.

22
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,354
And I know a lot of guys
who can sing better.

23
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:58,607
But I can't think of anybody
who can do both as well.

24
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:01,651
- What about Billy Hertz?
- He's stiff, pompous.

25
00:03:01,652 --> 00:03:04,404
Look, Cookie, this isn't
<i>Student Prince</i> or <i>Blossom Time.</i>

26
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:06,781
The guy who plays this part
has to act while he's singing

27
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:08,586
and sing while he's acting.

28
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:10,535
You never saw <i>Lonesome Town.</i>

29
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:13,955
Elgin played a part exactly like this,
and he was just magnificent in it.

30
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:16,207
All right, don't take my word for it.
Ask Henry.

31
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,709
He played the piano in the pit
for that show.

32
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,972
- When was that?
- Seven or eight years ago.

33
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,213
He wasn't falling off bar stools then.

34
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:24,007
I hear he hasn't had a drink
in a long time.

35
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:27,427
- To a drunk, 10 minutes is a long time.
- I'm not asking you to live with him!

36
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:29,012
I just want you to listen to him!

37
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:30,805
All right! Go ahead! Go ahead!

38
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:32,151
- Go ahead!
- Larry!

39
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,467
Larry?

40
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,395
- As soon as Elgin comes in, I want...
- He's here waiting.

41
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,022
I didn't want to interrupt you
while you were...

42
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:40,223
Send him in.

43
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:43,913
Now, Cookie, no cracks, please.

44
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,877
What are you fellows
auditioning out there, owls?

45
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:02,181
Hello, Frank.

46
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:04,714
- Bernie Dodd.
- How do you do?

47
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:07,102
- This is our producer, Mr. Cook.
- How do you do, Mr. Cook?

48
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:09,271
Hello. How are you?

49
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:11,774
Paul Ungen
and you know Henry Johnson.

50
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,474
- Hey, Henry.
- Hello, Frank. It's been a long time.

51
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:16,935
Gee, I told this guy years ago
to stop playing other people's music

52
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,395
and write some of his own.

53
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:19,646
So, you took my advice?

54
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:21,106
- How's the family?
- Fine.

55
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,441
Guess that big boy of yours
is in high school by now.

56
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,151
- He's in the Air Force.
- No.

57
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,903
Yes, he is.

58
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:29,208
Now let's get started.
I've got a luncheon date.

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,702
Frank, this is an offbeat kind of show.

60
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:36,204
It's a dramatization
of The Land <i>Around Us.</i>

61
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:38,592
- You remember the book?
- Yeah, sure.

62
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,583
Well, the boys have done what I consider

63
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:43,002
a kind of an exciting musical adaptation.

64
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:44,921
No numbers exactly.

65
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:47,340
The music is part of the fabric,
woven in and out.

66
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:49,342
That's the way to keep the seats
from getting dusty.

67
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,896
Give 'em something different.

68
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:52,378
Yeah.

69
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:55,734
Would you mind reading
a couple of scenes for Mr. Cook?

70
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:58,893
- There's one in the first act.
- Excuse me, Bernie, for interrupting,

71
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:02,105
but you were speaking
<i>of</i> Lonesome Town a minute ago.

72
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,535
Maybe Frank could do
the pitchman number.

73
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,912
That'd show Phil
everything you want him to see.

74
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:10,165
- It's all right with me if...
- I don't know if I remember it.

75
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:13,085
- You sure you do?
- I certainly should.

76
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:16,213
Eight performances a week
for a year and a half.

77
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:18,455
Maybe you ought to describe
the number to Mr. Cook.

78
00:05:18,456 --> 00:05:20,467
- Give him a kind of a lead-in.
- Okay.

79
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,084
Well, it wasn't much, really.

80
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:25,681
It was just a thing where I played
one of those pitchmen.

81
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:27,881
Sort of a fanciful character,

82
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:30,967
only instead of selling a patent
medicine or something like that,

83
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,677
I was selling a philosophy.

84
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:35,221
You know, sort of a sunshine salesman.

85
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:37,318
And the scene was
a New York street corner,

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,447
and I worked under
a lamppost like this, and I had a...

87
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:43,772
Is it okay if I use this for a minute?

88
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:45,993
- Use anything you like.
- Thanks.

89
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,738
And now, when I made my entrance,
I was carrying...

90
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:54,157
Okay, okay, I get it.

91
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:55,628
Now, let's get on with it.

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
Right.

93
00:05:57,578 --> 00:06:00,747
I just wanted to say
I was carrying an imaginary valise,

94
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:03,374
you know,
one of those pitchmen's outfits?

95
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,720
Okay, Henry.

96
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:25,282
And then a crowd of sourpusses
begin to gather around, you see?

97
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,775
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry</i>

98
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:31,361
<i>And... That's a little high for me, Henry</i>

99
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:33,696
<i>Can you get it down a tone?</i>

100
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:36,658
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry</i>

101
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,422
<i>And do away with
worry, worry, worry, worry</i>

102
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,666
<i>Sometime or other, brother</i>

103
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:48,222
<i>Everybody gets his back to the wall</i>

104
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:52,173
<i>History discloses life's no bed of roses
And that's for darn sure</i>

105
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:55,646
<i>Kings topple and nations fall</i>

106
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:57,887
<i>Rich man, poor man, Indian chief</i>

107
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,973
<i>How, Chief!
He's a left-handed Indian, this kid</i>

108
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,528
<i>I include you all</i>

109
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:05,144
<i>Simpletons, noodle-heads</i>

110
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:07,188
<i>You're off</i>

111
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,995
<i>If you don't take advantage of my cure-all</i>

112
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:14,362
Now, friends,
I tell you what I'm going to do.

113
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:17,073
I have here in this little valise here
nostrums, cure-alls, panaceas,

114
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:20,702
unguents, oils, and the healing waters.

115
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:22,579
What did you say, son?

116
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,174
You say the valise is empty?

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,916
Son, this valise is loaded.

118
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,805
You're just looking at it with your eyes,
and your windows are foggy.

119
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:34,601
What did you say, friend?
You say you can't see nothing, either?

120
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,509
Well, friend, let me tell you something.

121
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,803
There's no trick in believing
in just what you see.

122
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:41,764
The trick is in
believing in what you can't see.

123
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:44,862
You've got to visualize the indiscernible.
For instance...

124
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:49,522
<i>Here's a moonbeam
that wants to go peeping in</i>

125
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:51,952
<i>Here's the lilt that the bluebird shares</i>

126
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:57,207
<i>Here's a tropical night to go sleeping in</i>

127
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,546
<i>Step up and sample my wares</i>

128
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,996
Every item in this valise,
ladies and gentlemen,

129
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:08,177
belongs to you as well
as it does to me.

130
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:12,086
<i>Here's the silver moon
from the sky up there</i>

131
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:15,392
<i>And the emerald meadow outdoors
Oh, yes</i>

132
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:19,093
<i>For the wealth of treasure
there is to share</i>

133
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:20,731
<i>It's mine</i>

134
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,472
<i>It's yours</i>

135
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:25,934
<i>Now, if you live a dream
oh, how precious is</i>

136
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:29,187
<i>An imagination that soars</i>

137
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:34,484
<i>It can make this world we're in
Hers and his and mine</i>

138
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,194
<i>And yours</i>

139
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:39,572
<i>Now, if you want blue skies about</i>

140
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:41,115
<i>Year in</i>

141
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:42,753
<i>Year out</i>

142
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:48,467
<i>All you ever need in the last analysis</i>

143
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:50,333
<i>Is this</i>

144
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:53,628
<i>Try a cheerful song and a valentine</i>

145
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,725
<i>And a sense of humor that scores</i>

146
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:58,967
<i>You're no longer in a spin</i>

147
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:00,885
<i>It's a great world we're in</i>

148
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:02,773
<i>And it's mine</i>

149
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:05,692
<i>It's yours</i>

150
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:08,737
What's that you say, Officer?

151
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,532
Have I got a license?

152
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:15,024
Just got the greatest license
in the world, poetic license.

153
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,234
What did you say?

154
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:18,831
You've been listening to my pitch?

155
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,874
We're going to the station house?

156
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,784
You got a desk sergeant down there

157
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:26,452
who's a little on the prod,
a little on the muscle,

158
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,162
a little on the cantankerous side?

159
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:29,466
Here's how we'll handle his case.

160
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:33,543
<i>With a cheerful song and a valentine</i>

161
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:36,390
<i>And a sense of humor that scores</i>

162
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:40,425
<i>You're no longer in a spin
It's a great world you're in</i>

163
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,062
<i>And it's mine</i>

164
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:44,940
<i>It's yours</i>

165
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,443
<i>And it's hers</i>

166
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,686
<i>And it's his</i>

167
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:53,146
Share it among your friends.

168
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:56,189
If you got some of it on you,
tell 'em where you got it.

169
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:01,904
Thanks, Henry. You always did have
a good beat for a writer, you know that?

170
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,114
Fine, Frank, fine.

171
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:04,323
You ought to hear it with an orchestra.

172
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:06,545
It's much... It's good and lousy.

173
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,922
Would you wait outside for a second?

174
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:11,873
Say, I'm a little in the dark about this.

175
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:14,052
What's it for, a musical spot?

176
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:15,418
A small part or what?

177
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:16,722
It's the lead, Frank.

178
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:19,474
The whole show is built
around this character.

179
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:31,726
Well, what do you think?

180
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:33,614
Didn't it speak for itself?

181
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,855
Bernie, he's probably
been doing that material

182
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:38,316
at dinner parties for the last 10 years.

183
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:41,360
Did it prove he's worth risking
over $200,000 on?

184
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,738
Did it prove he can carry a whole show?

185
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,573
Bernie, be sensible.

186
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:48,086
That guy has been laying in the pickle,
ever since you were a kid.

187
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:51,913
Someone once took a chance
with an actress named Laurette Taylor

188
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:54,123
in <i>The Glass Menagerie,</i>
and look what she did.

189
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:56,845
Bernie, tell me something.
What are you trying to prove?

190
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:59,128
You've got a good book, good music.

191
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,964
Why can't you be satisfied
with a good, reliable,

192
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,591
adequate, normal, sober actor?

193
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:07,804
Because he'll give you a good, reliable,
adequate, normal, sober performance.

194
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:10,275
And that's not what people
pay $6.60 to see.

195
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:12,809
On the last show, you fought me
every step of the way with Danelli.

196
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,602
And I still think you were wrong.

197
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:17,074
Instead of taking an actor
and teaching him how to box,

198
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,856
you have to go to Stillman's Gym

199
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:20,775
and get a punch-drunk fighter
and teach him how to act.

200
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,235
He gave you a great performance,
didn't he?

201
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:24,445
Yes. He gave us a lot of trouble, too.

202
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:27,115
He was cracked.
If there was a good fight at the Garden,

203
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:28,908
he just wouldn't show up
for the performance.

204
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,295
Cookie, I promise you,

205
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:33,788
with Elgin, you're apt to get something
that happens once in 20 years.

206
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,457
I know it'll be a lot of hard work,
but I'll get it out of him.

207
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,595
You're good, Bernie,
but you're not that good.

208
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,838
That's what people have been saying
to me since I was this high.

209
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,132
So, now you're going to show them.

210
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,435
Every one of them.

211
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:47,927
Just directing
doesn't satisfy you any longer.

212
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:50,482
Now, you want to take a corpse
and breathe life into it.

213
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,443
Maybe I'm crazy, but...

214
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:55,810
Doesn't this worry you guys?

215
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:57,531
Not if it doesn't worry Bernie.

216
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:01,274
He's too old for the part.

217
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:04,443
We'll get a couple of hairpieces.
We'll make him look 10 years younger.

218
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:06,581
All right, all right, Bernie.

219
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,448
But could we at least look around for
someone else while he's rehearsing?

220
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:12,368
No. No, once we start with him,
we don't let him go without real cause.

221
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:15,590
A binge is a real cause,
or if he can't retain lines.

222
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:18,291
And I want to give him a run-of-the-play
contract, no two-week deal.

223
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:19,333
Now wait a minute...

224
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,751
Because I need his complete confidence.

225
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:23,296
We give him a two-weeks clause,
he knows we can let him go at any time.

226
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:26,507
No, sir.
I'm in for a $40,000 bite already.

227
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:29,135
But I'll take that loss before
I'll give him a run-of-the-play contract!

228
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:30,981
Okay, Phil, two weeks.
Agreed with you, Paul?

229
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:33,233
- Henry?
- Okay with me.

230
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:35,235
Frank?

231
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:37,476
Frank Elgin!

232
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:38,677
Elgin?

233
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:40,313
He's gone. He left.

234
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:42,398
- What do you mean he left?
- He left.

235
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,774
Where? Coffee, what?

236
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,537
He just walked out, Bernie. He didn't say.

237
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,710
Try the nearest bar.

238
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,042
Mr. Elgin in?

239
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:44,168
No, he's not.

240
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,369
You Mrs. Elgin?

241
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:48,256
I'd like to talk to Frank.
I'm Bernie Dodd.

242
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:49,840
How do you do?

243
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,342
I don't know when Frank will be back.

244
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,647
- Mind if I wait?
- Well...

245
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:00,726
I was just going to have some coffee.
Would you like some?

246
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:01,894
No, thanks.

247
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:03,490
Frank say when he'd be back?

248
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:05,534
He didn't say where he was going.

249
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:09,944
Didn't he tell you he had
an audition with me this morning?

250
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:11,145
No.

251
00:14:11,738 --> 00:14:14,084
I looked around after it was over,
but he'd gone.

252
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:16,545
Will he do?

253
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:18,964
That all depends.

254
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:40,026
If you're wondering if you can get Frank
for very little money, you can.

255
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,320
Doesn't depend on that.

256
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:44,281
Does he still drink?

257
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:49,483
Now, just what did you think
I would answer to that, Mr. Dodd?

258
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:50,704
- Touché.
- What?

259
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,862
"Touché." In French that means...

260
00:14:52,863 --> 00:14:55,500
Come on, everybody knows
what "touché" means.

261
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,211
You're even younger than I thought.

262
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:01,882
And you try to look like an old lady,
and you're not.

263
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,717
Shouldn't wear your hair like that.

264
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,125
There are two kinds of women,

265
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:08,044
those who pay too much attention
to themselves

266
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:09,245
and those who don't pay enough.

267
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:11,672
Say, that's quite a pearl of wisdom.

268
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:13,393
May I quote you?

269
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:17,814
How long you and Frank been married?

270
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,057
- Ten years.
- Where'd you meet, in a show?

271
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:22,850
Now, look, Mr. Dodd, don't you think...

272
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:24,643
I'm just trying to find out
if you were ever an actress.

273
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,656
No, not me, thank you.

274
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,273
I'm just a girl from the country.

275
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:33,622
The theater and the people in it have
always been a complete mystery to me.

276
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:35,646
They still are.

277
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:44,341
Dreiser, Balzac, Montaigne...

278
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,552
- Who reads these books?
- I do.

279
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:52,421
I'm afraid to ask you if you enjoy them.
You'd bite my head off.

280
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:53,683
Montaigne's too polite for me.

281
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:55,977
That doesn't surprise me.

282
00:15:58,136 --> 00:15:59,336
Frank's old recordings?

283
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:01,013
Some new.

284
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:02,859
The one on the machine
he did last week.

285
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,135
A man with his talent.

286
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:31,012
It's degrading.

287
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:33,473
So is not eating.

288
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:37,310
Why didn't you wait?

289
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,220
I figured the boat had sailed.

290
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:43,525
I had a feeling
the producer didn't like me.

291
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:45,516
Since when does it have to be
in an actor's contract

292
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:46,987
the producer has to love him?

293
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:50,407
Well, I can't go to bat
unless I feel everybody's rooting for me.

294
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,067
- Cook thinks you're a drinker.
- No, I don't booze it up on a show.

295
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:56,871
Not according to Maxwell. I checked.

296
00:16:57,737 --> 00:16:59,447
You worked for him in '46.

297
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,251
After a couple of months,
he had to replace you.

298
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:06,464
While I was playing in that show, our...

299
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,456
Our son died.

300
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:10,594
All right, that takes care of that show.
What about this one?

301
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,054
I need an actor who can stay sober
and learn lines.

302
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,713
- Are you that actor or not?
- I don't...

303
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:16,964
Make up your mind.

304
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,716
Give me a little time.

305
00:17:18,717 --> 00:17:21,646
Cook wasn't the only reason
I left the theater just now.

306
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:23,607
I wanted to talk it over with my wife.

307
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:26,056
Gee, I wouldn't think of taking
a part like this

308
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,850
without talking it over
with Georgie first.

309
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:29,435
All right, talk it over.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

310
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:31,270
Mr. Dodd, don't you see?

311
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:33,325
He's afraid of the responsibility.

312
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,275
But I'm the one that's taking the chance.
The gamble's all on my side.

313
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,652
It's not a question
of being afraid of the responsibility.

314
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:40,665
It's just that...

315
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:43,460
Well, the part's the whole show.
You said so yourself.

316
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,744
Gee, you've been rehearsing five days,

317
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:48,662
and you're opening in Boston the 28th.

318
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:51,165
I don't think I could
learn the lines in that time.

319
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,501
You need a Walter Huston
or somebody like that.

320
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:55,461
It's bad enough to go
to Hollywood to cast.

321
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,223
Now, you suggest I go to heaven.

322
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:00,716
You can do it, Frank. I know you can.

323
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:02,520
Why are you so sure?

324
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:06,096
Because when I first saw him, I was
a hatcheck boy at the Shubert Theatre.

325
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,140
You, Lunt and Jolson,
you were my heroes.

326
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,444
I know everything you've done.

327
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,895
Naturally, Mr. Dodd, you exaggerate
the sentiment to make your point.

328
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:14,605
Are you for him or against him?

329
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:15,981
I'm his wife.

330
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:18,953
All I want is complete honesty
from both of you.

331
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,207
Flattery is cheap, Mr. Dodd.
How about a little costly truth?

332
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,835
All right.

333
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,744
I'm not blind to Frank's condition.

334
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:30,955
One look at this room tells me
what he is.

335
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,665
And I'm not one of
those nice, friendly people

336
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:36,137
who slaps you on the back, buys you
a drink and that's as far as it goes.

337
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,587
If you take this job, Frank,
I won't leave you on a limb.

338
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:41,006
We'll work together and worry together.

339
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:44,521
But if you do me dirt, just once, no pity.

340
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:47,054
Not a drop of pity.

341
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:48,764
No pity, I like that.

342
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:50,694
Now, at least he knows what to expect.

343
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,060
What kind of a contract do you offer?

344
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:54,353
- Honey...
- Standard two-week contract.

345
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:55,688
- Not run-of-the-play?
- No.

346
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:58,357
Doesn't that mean you could let Frank
out anytime with two weeks' notice?

347
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:00,943
- That's exactly what it means.
- You just said he needed confidence.

348
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:04,071
He won't have it with a two-week clause
over his head. Would you?

349
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:07,491
I have nothing in my mind
except for Frank to play this part.

350
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,201
That sentiment again.

351
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:11,412
- Dear Lord.
- What is this?

352
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:13,455
I come up here
with the best intentions in the world,

353
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,124
and suddenly, I find I'm victimizing you.

354
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,292
Can I get a word in?

355
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,043
What'd I bring you, a basket of snakes?

356
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:20,014
It's not the two-weeks clause.

357
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:23,966
It's just that I don't want to bite off
more than I can chew, that's all.

358
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,634
You got the offer. Make up your mind.

359
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:27,564
We're booked into Boston for two weeks.

360
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:28,971
The season's still young.

361
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:30,400
We could stay out
until you were letter-perfect.

362
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,361
- Would you do that?
- Do it? I'd insist on it.

363
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:37,605
Talk it over with your agent here
and call the office by 3:00.

364
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:39,284
And that means not later.

365
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,872
Need a $20 bill?

366
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,569
You need it.

367
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,679
Why did you have to make
that crack about responsibility for?

368
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,229
Why didn't you tell me
about that audition this morning, Frank?

369
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,524
Because I wasn't sure
whether I could make it or not.

370
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:16,435
I must've walked up and down
47th Street a dozen times

371
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:18,114
before I could make myself
go through with it.

372
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:20,784
Don't keep things from me.

373
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,454
- I can't do it, can I?
- Of course you can.

374
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:27,446
You've got to try again,
and this seems a perfect opportunity.

375
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,751
Well, if I do take it, Georgie,
I'll need you,

376
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,796
every second, every step of the way.

377
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:37,467
I don't have any appointments, Frank,
all winter.

378
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:39,416
I wish it were a run-of-the-play contract.

379
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,835
Well, then why didn't you tell him that
when I brought it up?

380
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:43,003
Because I didn't want to antagonize him.

381
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:44,254
After all, if I do take the part,
I'm the one

382
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,382
that's going to have
to work with him, you know, not you.

383
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:47,716
Well, you'll never get a better deal.

384
00:20:47,717 --> 00:20:49,562
They won't give you perfect terms.

385
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:51,940
So, take it and do your level best.

386
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,808
Wait a minute. Wait a minute here.

387
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:57,111
Two-weeks clause.

388
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:59,614
They can give me notice anytime,

389
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:02,492
but I can give them notice, too.

390
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,745
I can walk out anytime I want.

391
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:07,861
If I feel it isn't working out, I...

392
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:09,624
You mean you can quit, Frank?

393
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,251
No, not the way you mean it.

394
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,451
But if the show doesn't pan out,

395
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,464
I certainly don't want
to come into New York in a turkey.

396
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:19,884
But maybe this time,
it will work out, though.

397
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:24,013
Bernie likes me,
and Henry Johnson's pulling for me.

398
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:26,891
That guy, Cook, I got to worry about.

399
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:31,896
Ever since we've settled here,
we've been having trouble, Joe.

400
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:33,762
And now, instead of fields of wheat,

401
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:36,526
we got nothing but stubble
rotting in the brown dust.

402
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:38,475
I've talked it over with Stella.

403
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:40,113
We've had enough. We're leaving.

404
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,355
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's push on.

405
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:45,023
There's nothing to stay around here for.

406
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:47,120
- How about you, Joe?
- I'm staying.

407
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:50,946
You know, they say sometimes
when a man falls from a great height,

408
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:53,877
before he hits bottom,
his whole life flashes by.

409
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,089
In one split second, he sees himself
for what he was and what he is.

410
00:21:58,872 --> 00:22:01,290
But you don't always
have to plummet like a hailstone

411
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,916
to face that split second.

412
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,117
Mean it, Frank, mean it!

413
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:08,433
To plummet like a hailstone
to face that split second.

414
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:11,144
It can come to you as it did to me today,

415
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:12,459
as you stand...

416
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:14,564
It can, if...

417
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,524
What is it, Larry?

418
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:18,307
"In the middle of a smoldering field."

419
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:20,517
As you stand in the middle
of a smoldering field,

420
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:24,104
and you see your prayers and hopes
go up in wisps of smoke.

421
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:25,856
It's nothing, Frank, just nothing.

422
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:28,661
This is the most important decision
in the man's life.

423
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:29,943
The way you're playing him,

424
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:32,874
it sounds like he's trying to decide
what kind of eggs to have for breakfast.

425
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,293
And that goes for the rest of you, too.

426
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:39,411
I'm sorry, Bernie, it's just that
I'm still fighting these words.

427
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:42,342
You should've had 'em licked by now.
We've been in rehearsal 10 days.

428
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:45,011
- All right, let's take it from...
- Bernie.

429
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:47,013
It can't be that late.

430
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:49,933
Where does it go?

431
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:52,424
All right, knock off. Same time tomorrow.

432
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:53,811
We'll start with this scene.

433
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:55,844
Good night, Bernie. See you tomorrow.

434
00:22:55,845 --> 00:22:57,137
- Good night, Bernie.
- Good night.

435
00:22:57,138 --> 00:23:00,026
- You need me for anything, Bernie?
- No.

436
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,153
Want me to turn off the border?

437
00:23:02,268 --> 00:23:04,906
- Yeah. Good night.
- Good night.

438
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:08,941
I'm sorry, Bernie, about the words.

439
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:10,286
It's just that,

440
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:13,487
well, I've had a lot
of other things on my mind.

441
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:15,166
I know you have.

442
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,282
Every time I give you a direction,

443
00:23:17,283 --> 00:23:19,420
I have the feeling you're
off in space somewhere.

444
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,787
Frank, you can be great in this part,

445
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:24,164
but it demands your
undivided concentration

446
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:25,707
and every ounce of energy you've got.

447
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,908
I know.

448
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,430
I know,
I keep telling myself that, Bernie.

449
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:32,600
And then after rehearsal,
I go home to study, and there's...

450
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:36,468
Well, you've got headaches enough
of your own.

451
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:38,106
- Good night.
- Frank?

452
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:40,733
Having trouble at home?

453
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:42,986
No, nothing like that.

454
00:23:45,186 --> 00:23:47,073
What's the matter?
Don't you believe me?

455
00:23:48,857 --> 00:23:50,535
Everyone has trouble at home.

456
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:54,914
The only ones who deny it
are those that have too much of it.

457
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:58,876
I denied it for five years
with the former Mrs. Dodd.

458
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,295
Funny, I never had the impression
that you were married.

459
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:04,549
Neither did my wife.

460
00:24:04,998 --> 00:24:06,342
That was my trouble.

461
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,201
What's yours?

462
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:14,172
It's nothing important. It'll work out.

463
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:15,393
I'll see you in the morning.

464
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,801
Does your wife
really want you to play this part?

465
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:19,397
Yeah, she's all for it.

466
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:21,149
I was just wondering.

467
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:25,153
The day I met her, she seemed
a little difficult about terms.

468
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:29,396
- Rather domineering, I thought.
- She wasn't always like that.

469
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:30,825
I know, I know.

470
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:35,360
They all start out as Juliets
and wind up as Lady Macbeths.

471
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:39,500
When I first met her, she was
as fine a person as you've ever seen.

472
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:42,462
She had background and breeding.

473
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,133
She had a kind of a nobility about her

474
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,511
that just made me feel proud
to be with her.

475
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,765
Of course, I was a good deal older
than she was,

476
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:56,476
but it didn't seem to make any difference,

477
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:59,312
because she wasn't a flighty kid
or anything like that.

478
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:02,273
She had a poise
and a dignity that was ageless.

479
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:06,694
Those first few years, I...

480
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,363
I just never knew a better life.

481
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,243
A wife who was everything
I'd always been looking for

482
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:18,331
and a son who was smart and healthy.

483
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,336
Then our son died.

484
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:28,549
I came home from the theater one night
a couple of months later, and...

485
00:25:29,415 --> 00:25:30,874
And there's this kid who...

486
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,763
Well, I don't think she ever
had a real drink in her life before.

487
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:39,560
There she is stretched out
across the bed dead drunk

488
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:43,189
with her wrists cut and bleeding like a...

489
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:53,282
She was jealous of the fact that
I had my work and something to live for.

490
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:56,577
She felt she had nothing, you see?

491
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:02,041
Inside of a year,
she was a hopeless drunkard.

492
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:08,589
So, in an effort to give her
some purpose in life,

493
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:12,260
I made her feel
that I needed her in my work.

494
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,804
I let her pick
all the songs I should record

495
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:16,722
and the shows I ought to do.

496
00:26:18,297 --> 00:26:23,271
She started taking over everything,
then she became very possessive.

497
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:29,193
And wanted to make all the decisions,
had to be with me all the time.

498
00:26:30,101 --> 00:26:31,977
Whenever I was away from her, why,

499
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:34,282
she acted as if I'd run off
with another woman or something.

500
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:38,411
She had fits of depression.

501
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:43,499
One time, she set fire to a hotel suite.

502
00:26:46,617 --> 00:26:48,754
That's when I began
hitting the bottle pretty hard.

503
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:54,135
Does she still drink?

504
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,554
No.

505
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:58,973
She stopped when I began.

506
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:02,393
That figures.

507
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:06,814
You were the weak one now.
That's what she wanted.

508
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:13,226
I suppose you have
to bring her up to Boston, huh?

509
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:15,781
I couldn't leave her alone, Bernie.

510
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:17,522
I guess you thought it was kind of funny

511
00:27:17,523 --> 00:27:20,453
I didn't hang around the theater
after the audition the other day.

512
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,237
But, gee, if I'd have taken
this part without talking to her first,

513
00:27:24,238 --> 00:27:26,250
I don't know what would have happened.

514
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:28,617
I had to make believe
that I didn't want it,

515
00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:30,327
that I was afraid of it, you see?

516
00:27:30,328 --> 00:27:32,370
And then that left it open
for her to convince me,

517
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:34,884
like it was her idea and not mine.

518
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:40,514
They can get awful bent
out of shape sometimes, can't they?

519
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:43,935
You know, my wife was so twisted,

520
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:48,105
she once said to me,
"I hope your next play's a flop,

521
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:51,431
so the whole world can see
how much I love you,

522
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:53,569
even though you're a failure."

523
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:06,374
Georgie?

524
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:09,866
Just coming from a movie.

525
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:12,577
Passing by, I thought
you might be through.

526
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:14,632
Your timing was perfect, Mrs. Elgin.

527
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,801
I have a knack that way.

528
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:20,596
Good evening, Mr. Dodd.
How is my husband doing?

529
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:25,393
Well, in my less-than-humble opinion,
he's what you call a natural.

530
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:29,427
Don't let him kid you, honey.
I was floundering all over the place.

531
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:32,013
We're going to have to
rehearse those cues a lot.

532
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:35,194
You can thank her, you know, for the
six or seven words that I did know.

533
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:36,821
Thanks.

534
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:41,492
- Did I intrude?
- No, no. We were just breaking up.

535
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:45,026
I don't like to make myself obtrusive
when Frank's working,

536
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:47,623
unless, of course, he needs my help.

537
00:28:48,364 --> 00:28:53,170
- You're sure I'm not in the way?
- No, no. We were just closing up shop

538
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:56,299
and giving it back to the theater ghosts.

539
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:14,608
There's nothing quite so mysterious
and silent as a dark theater.

540
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:18,195
A night without a star.

541
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:23,826
- Why don't we go and get some coffee?
- Georgie?

542
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:27,944
She's the one that makes
all the decisions in our family.

543
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,874
Is that true, Mrs. Elgin?

544
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,129
To the extent that Frank's
brought out the mother in me, yes.

545
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:37,590
I'd like some coffee.

546
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:41,374
And I'd like to get to know
Mr. Dodd better.

547
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,512
I'd like to get to know you better.

548
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,599
Shall we go along?

549
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,353
Yes.

550
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:53,105
The theater's mysterious.

551
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,112
It sure is.

552
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:15,336
This way, please.

553
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,595
Hi, Charlie.

554
00:30:24,794 --> 00:30:26,972
Excuse me a minute, will you, honey?

555
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:29,934
No, thanks, never use them.

556
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,146
Are you really satisfied
with Frank's work, Mr. Dodd?

557
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:37,889
I'll be happy
when he gets the part out of his hands.

558
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,361
He has his worries with those lines.

559
00:30:41,477 --> 00:30:44,646
And I'd appreciate it if you didn't
add to those worries, Mrs. Elgin.

560
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:46,314
He seems to be more concerned about

561
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:49,161
how you're going to take
his performance than the audience.

562
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:52,623
You mean he's too focused
on my reaction?

563
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:55,532
That's one way of putting it.

564
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:59,296
You could help a lot
by being careful of what you do and say.

565
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:03,540
I try to be careful, Mr. Dodd,
but being an actor's wife

566
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:05,709
is not the easiest of jobs.

567
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,712
If I tell him he's magnificent,
he says I'm not being honest.

568
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:11,256
If I tell him he's not magnificent,
he says I don't love him.

569
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:13,300
Why don't you tell him he's good
but can be better?

570
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:16,594
- Is that what the critics will tell him?
- Are you a critic or a wife?

571
00:31:16,595 --> 00:31:19,775
Let's say I try in my small way to help.

572
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:24,936
That's what my ex-wife
used to keep reminding me of.

573
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:26,354
Tearfully.

574
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:29,994
She had a theory that behind every
great man there was a great woman.

575
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,445
She also was thoroughly convinced
that she was great

576
00:31:33,446 --> 00:31:37,293
and that all I needed to qualify
was guidance on her part.

577
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:39,753
She worked hard at it.

578
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:41,411
Too hard.

579
00:31:41,412 --> 00:31:44,341
That still doesn't prove
her theory was completely wrong.

580
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:48,762
I imagine one could go through history
and find a few good examples.

581
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:53,225
It's a pity that Leonardo da Vinci
never had a wife to guide him.

582
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:55,352
He might've really gotten somewhere.

583
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,516
I'm sorry, dear,
but do you know who that was?

584
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:06,822
Old Charlie Blair.
You remember him, he was...

585
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:26,664
<i>Here's another oldie coming up.</i>

586
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:29,000
<i>It's climbing right back up
onto the hit parade again.</i>

587
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:30,585
<i>But let's turn back the calendar</i>

588
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:33,599
<i>and listen to the original recording
made by Frank Elgin.</i>

589
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:36,091
<i>It's on a Vogue label, and he's backed up</i>

590
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:37,550
<i>by Jimmie Bolton's orchestra.</i>

591
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:40,064
<i>Here it is. See if you remember it.</i>

592
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,944
<i>The flaxen hair</i>

593
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:47,863
<i>The tender voice</i>

594
00:32:48,354 --> 00:32:52,243
<i>The laughing eyes gave me no choice</i>

595
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:55,371
<i>No more the doubt</i>

596
00:32:55,736 --> 00:32:57,790
<i>I used to face</i>

597
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:00,960
<i>No more the doubt</i>

598
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:04,880
<i>No more the chase</i>

599
00:33:06,956 --> 00:33:11,178
<i>The search is through</i>

600
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,599
<i>You've got what it takes</i>

601
00:33:16,674 --> 00:33:22,680
<i>There was no passing you by</i>

602
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:31,198
<i>In my who's who</i>

603
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:36,245
<i>You've got what it takes</i>

604
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:42,908
<i>The who, the where, the when, the why</i>

605
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:51,302
<i>One look and, oh</i>

606
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,723
<i>No painting I know</i>

607
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:01,770
<i>Can equal your loveliness</i>

608
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:06,191
<i>Head to toe</i>

609
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:12,312
<i>At last the breaks</i>

610
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:16,660
<i>You've got what it takes</i>

611
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:21,749
<i>So easy to see</i>

612
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:26,503
<i>For all time to be</i>

613
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:32,384
<i>You've got what it takes</i>

614
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:37,848
<i>To take me</i>

615
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:45,887
- Was that okay for you, Jimmie?
- Good here.

616
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,764
How about you, Harry?
You want to buy that one?

617
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:50,110
Sure will.
This one was it for my money.

618
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:52,185
Give you the playback in just a second.

619
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:53,781
Take five, boys.

620
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,982
There's my master.

621
00:34:57,983 --> 00:35:01,152
You pretty near broke me up there,
you and your bad beat.

622
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:03,123
- How did it sound, honey?
- It's a lovely tune.

623
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,865
- Well, what about the singer?
- He has a pleasant voice.

624
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:07,075
Pleasant voice?

625
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:09,744
Good thing you're not my press agent,
or we'd all starve to death.

626
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:11,955
Come on, Johnnie.
I've got a hair appointment.

627
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:14,134
Well, you're not going to take him
to the beauty parlor?

628
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,876
- Well, it's Sally's day off.
- No, you don't.

629
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:19,087
He'll grow up to be
a hairdresser or something.

630
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:21,965
- I'm not doing anything. I'll take him.
- Where to? The Lambs Club?

631
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:23,883
And watch you play pool all afternoon?

632
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:26,344
Well, that's better
than teaching him how to set a wave.

633
00:35:26,345 --> 00:35:28,304
All right, all right,
I'll take him to the zoo.

634
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:30,473
And bring him home
full of peanuts and ice cream

635
00:35:30,474 --> 00:35:32,225
and chocolate bars. No, thanks.

636
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:34,227
Hey, Johnnie,
tell this lady to run along, will you?

637
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:36,104
- Okay.
- Tell her this is strictly stag.

638
00:35:36,105 --> 00:35:37,355
- Strictly stag.
- All right.

639
00:35:37,356 --> 00:35:39,899
All right. He's your responsibility.

640
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,985
And if he gets a stomachache
in the middle of the night,

641
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:44,665
that's going to be strictly stag, too.

642
00:35:45,406 --> 00:35:46,792
Goodbye.

643
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:52,881
Isn't Mommy a doll?

644
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,052
Goodbye, hon.

645
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,754
- Peanuts.
- Yeah, well, you're a cinch.

646
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:04,591
First, we got to hear this playback,
then Charlie wants a couple of pictures.

647
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:07,187
Here it comes.
Take two of the chorus, Frank.

648
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:12,515
<i>The search is through</i>

649
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:17,186
<i>You've got what it takes</i>

650
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:23,527
<i>There was no passing you by</i>

651
00:36:28,198 --> 00:36:30,586
Mr. Elgin! Mr. Elgin!

652
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:33,286
Can I get just one more shot?
Dave wants one of you

653
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:35,204
looking at the trademark.
It's for the album cover.

654
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:37,248
Well, make it fast.
I got a date with my friend here.

655
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,449
Right.

656
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:42,170
I think it would be better
without the hat, Mr. Elgin.

657
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:43,421
Right.

658
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:45,893
Now, put your hands up on the record.

659
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:51,523
Put the right one down at the bottom, too.

660
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:54,193
That's perfect. Just be a second.

661
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,153
Just hold it.

662
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:59,239
Hold it. Hold it!

663
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:03,149
Come on, quick, hurry up!

664
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,120
Johnnie! Johnnie!

665
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:12,033
<i>At last the breaks</i>

666
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:16,496
<i>You've got what it takes</i>

667
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:17,800
<i>So easy...</i>

668
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:20,511
The men for the trunk
are downstairs, so I...

669
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,555
<i>For all...</i>

670
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,768
When did you get these, Frank?

671
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:13,063
Last night, after you fell asleep.

672
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:16,525
I went out and got a paper and...

673
00:38:17,683 --> 00:38:19,236
What's the difference?

674
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:20,904
I got a good night's sleep.

675
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:23,031
No more, Frank.

676
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:28,662
When we get to Boston,
I'll get you some sleeping pills.

677
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:30,330
One a night can't hurt.

678
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:33,625
I'm not sure I'm going to Boston.

679
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:41,831
What's the use of me trying
to kid myself?

680
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:44,041
I'll never be able to go
through with this show.

681
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:46,930
I'll mess it up just like I've messed up
everything else in my life.

682
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:49,505
- That day was an accident.
- Yeah, that's what the papers said.

683
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:52,884
It wasn't any accident, and I know it.
He was my responsibility that day.

684
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:56,523
- All I had to do was hold on to his hand.
- Frank, stop it! Stop!

685
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:05,897
Have you told Dodd about this?

686
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:08,368
Of course I haven't.
And don't you tell him, either.

687
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:10,370
I won't.

688
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:14,405
I think maybe you should. It might help.

689
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:17,377
Nobody's going to have any respect
for a guy who...

690
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:20,631
He'd tell Cook.
He'd fire me in five minutes.

691
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,040
Who's going to risk $200,000
on a guy who's that irresponsible?

692
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,219
All right, let's say you were responsible.

693
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,211
That's exactly
why you've got to go through with it.

694
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:30,254
- You've got to prove to yourself...
- You don't got what that...

695
00:39:30,255 --> 00:39:32,882
You don't know what it's like
to stand out there on that stage all alone

696
00:39:32,883 --> 00:39:34,675
with the whole show on your shoulders.

697
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:37,105
If I'm no good, the show's no good.

698
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:39,983
I got the future of 100 people
in my hand.

699
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,654
This hand. This hand!

700
00:39:48,106 --> 00:39:50,702
- Elgin? Trunk for Boston?
- Come in.

701
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:55,154
- Theater or the hotel?
- Theater.

702
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:58,543
- No, no, wait a...
- Everything's packed. It's ready.

703
00:40:14,383 --> 00:40:16,801
Maggie, I tell you,
Joe's nothing but a dreamer.

704
00:40:16,802 --> 00:40:18,761
Then the least you can do
is go out to the valley

705
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:21,013
and let him show you
what he's been dreaming about.

706
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:23,610
That's fair enough, Maggie.
Come on, Phil.

707
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:51,794
<i>The land around us</i>

708
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:53,640
<i>Will be in bloom</i>

709
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:59,886
<i>With song and laughter
And elbow room</i>

710
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:04,985
<i>A town will blossom here
With all serene</i>

711
00:41:05,684 --> 00:41:10,813
<i>With houses white
And with gardens green</i>

712
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:13,368
<i>The lanes are shady</i>

713
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:16,360
<i>The streets are wide</i>

714
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:21,835
<i>You and your lady are full of pride</i>

715
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:28,874
<i>I can hear children's voices
I can hear Sunday chimes</i>

716
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,545
<i>All across the valley better times</i>

717
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:40,145
<i>On land we found us
One thing I know</i>

718
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:43,315
<i>The land around us</i>

719
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:48,403
<i>Will grow and grow</i>

720
00:41:51,188 --> 00:41:53,992
<i>We'll put the post office here</i>

721
00:41:54,149 --> 00:41:56,692
<i>And the high school there</i>

722
00:41:56,693 --> 00:41:59,695
<i>And if we fail to put up a jail</i>

723
00:41:59,696 --> 00:42:02,239
<i>We hope you don't mind</i>

724
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,784
<i>Round here we'll have no galoot</i>

725
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:07,422
<i>Who totes a sixer to shoot</i>

726
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:10,539
<i>For in our plan, each citizen</i>

727
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,000
<i>Will be the respectable kind</i>

728
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:15,753
<i>Railroad station here</i>

729
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:18,100
<i>Opry house will be there</i>

730
00:42:18,215 --> 00:42:21,550
<i>We'll do our best, the uncivilized West</i>

731
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:23,814
<i>To conquer and tame</i>

732
00:42:24,346 --> 00:42:27,306
<i>We'll settle for not less</i>

733
00:42:27,307 --> 00:42:29,934
<i>Than a town that's pure and spotless</i>

734
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:34,741
<i>Or mud will be our name</i>

735
00:42:57,963 --> 00:43:00,297
How do they expect me
to make these fast changes like this?

736
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:01,841
What's the matter?
Haven't I been doing it right?

737
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:03,426
You've been doing it all right,
but I want you out front

738
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:05,052
watching my performance.

739
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:06,314
Give me the dickey. Come on.

740
00:43:06,596 --> 00:43:09,265
But I can tell from here, Frank.
You're doing just wonderfully.

741
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:10,735
I am not, and you know it.

742
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:13,644
Why don't they get me a dresser?

743
00:43:13,645 --> 00:43:15,980
Why, with the money they're paying me,
they could afford a dozen of them.

744
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:17,481
Do you want me to talk to Cook about it?

745
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:19,442
Yes. And while you're at it,
tell him to stop that understudy

746
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:20,609
from snooping around backstage.

747
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,236
I come off just now,
and he's hovering there like a vulture,

748
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:23,654
just waiting for me to cave in.

749
00:43:23,655 --> 00:43:25,406
I'm sure if you talked
to Mr. Dodd about it, he'd...

750
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:27,908
You talk to him.
Tell him to keep that guy out front.

751
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:30,161
And get me some new tissue.
That stuff is murdered.

752
00:43:30,162 --> 00:43:31,840
I will right after rehearsal.

753
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,373
Frank, I'm sorry

754
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:36,542
I stepped on that line of yours
in the depot scene.

755
00:43:36,543 --> 00:43:38,669
Well, that's all right.
Think nothing of it.

756
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,672
- It's just that I was so nervous.
- Nervous? What's to be nervous about?

757
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:43,685
It's just another show.

758
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:47,011
Where would you ever
find another star as sweet as that?

759
00:43:47,012 --> 00:43:48,815
What a wonderful guy.

760
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:52,850
I'd like to hold the orchestra
for about a half hour longer, Frank.

761
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:55,269
I want to go over that new arrangement
on Land <i>Around Us.</i>

762
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,854
Wait a minute, Henry.
They've been on overtime

763
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:59,190
for three and a half hours already.
Can't you do it in the morning?

764
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:01,067
Hey, Bernie,
is it okay if I take the doohickeys off?

765
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:02,746
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

766
00:44:03,653 --> 00:44:05,029
There we are. Be here tomorrow.

767
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,364
Bernie, Paul mentioned
something to me during the second act.

768
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:09,533
Well, I think Eleanor is way overboard
in that town hall scene.

769
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:11,035
I know she is. I know she is.

770
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:13,704
I wasn't thinking about Eleanor.
I was thinking about...

771
00:44:13,705 --> 00:44:14,830
Don't you think I know?

772
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:18,542
- Now, look, Bernie, I have some notes.
- So have I. I've got nine zillion of them,

773
00:44:18,543 --> 00:44:20,294
but we'll go over them tomorrow.

774
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:22,098
Dismiss the company.
Give them a 1:00 call.

775
00:44:22,547 --> 00:44:24,173
I'm going out for a breath of fresh air,

776
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,811
then we'll sit down quietly
and discuss that spot.

777
00:44:27,344 --> 00:44:29,095
Larry, hold Frank and Helen, will you?

778
00:44:29,096 --> 00:44:30,721
And run that scene in front of the church.

779
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:32,264
See if you can find out
what caused the mix-up.

780
00:44:32,265 --> 00:44:33,465
Yeah.

781
00:44:48,824 --> 00:44:51,575
You talked about the costumes,
the scenery, the lighting,

782
00:44:51,576 --> 00:44:53,744
but not one word about our real problem.

783
00:44:53,745 --> 00:44:55,590
I thought Elgin was terrible.

784
00:44:55,747 --> 00:44:58,332
That's why you take shows
out of town, Cookie.

785
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,553
Actors can improve. The scenery can't.

786
00:45:00,669 --> 00:45:03,671
If he spoke one word of the author's
script tonight, I never heard it.

787
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:05,089
He tripped on a rug
he'd never seen before!

788
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,465
He goes to sit down, and there's no chair!

789
00:45:06,466 --> 00:45:07,883
In the big scene, the door wouldn't open!

790
00:45:07,884 --> 00:45:09,729
What do you expect of him?

791
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:14,014
Besides that, Larry tells me
his wife was backstage

792
00:45:14,015 --> 00:45:15,944
all during the performance tonight.

793
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,310
She's enough to upset anyone.

794
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:19,603
What are you going to do about it?

795
00:45:19,604 --> 00:45:20,896
Lower the boom on her.

796
00:45:20,897 --> 00:45:23,368
Well, you asked for him.
He's your problem, Bernie.

797
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:24,869
I got plenty of my own.

798
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:28,279
The union insists
I take on three more stagehands.

799
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,480
Mr. Cook?

800
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:32,877
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

801
00:45:34,244 --> 00:45:38,633
- Do you think Frank needs a dresser?
- No, I don't, but I suppose you do.

802
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:41,928
Well, those two fast changes...

803
00:45:42,335 --> 00:45:45,004
Well, it's a very large part, after all.

804
00:45:45,005 --> 00:45:47,923
Bernie, every time
you nod your head like that,

805
00:45:47,924 --> 00:45:50,270
it costs us a couple hundred dollars.

806
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,565
You're going to nod us
right out of business.

807
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:58,611
Don't worry. We'll get him a dresser.

808
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:04,284
Mr. Cook seems to be almost what the
bad fairy promised Frank at his cradle.

809
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:07,078
He's not too bad.

810
00:46:08,528 --> 00:46:10,790
Gruff, but with a heart of stone.

811
00:46:16,995 --> 00:46:18,548
You smoke too much.

812
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:22,844
That's obvious.
A whole pack since 10:30.

813
00:46:23,835 --> 00:46:25,555
Careful you don't catch cold.

814
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:28,589
After every first dress rehearsal,

815
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,675
I always sit in a draft
hoping to catch pneumonia.

816
00:46:31,676 --> 00:46:33,313
It never works.

817
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:38,224
For the peaceful quiet of an oxygen tent.

818
00:46:38,225 --> 00:46:39,652
Mr. Dodd,

819
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:45,325
who is that tall, sort of gloomy man
that hangs around backstage?

820
00:46:46,149 --> 00:46:48,578
- Lucas? Is that the name?
- Yes.

821
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:53,489
General understudy.
Not much personality, but competent.

822
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:58,410
Well, excuse me for saying this,
but must he stay backstage?

823
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:01,299
- It seems to bother Frank, and I...
- I'll watch him.

824
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,585
Frank that insecure? He's working well.

825
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:08,629
Good humor most of the time.

826
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,851
Don't you know what hides
behind that good humor?

827
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:14,854
Certain men are very strange.

828
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,430
Business couldn't be better.
Wife and kiddies are fine.

829
00:47:18,431 --> 00:47:20,891
Jokes with the boys at the club.

830
00:47:20,892 --> 00:47:24,614
Then the next day you read
he's hung himself from the chandelier.

831
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,742
Is that supposed to be
a picture of Frank?

832
00:47:29,484 --> 00:47:30,954
Yes and no.

833
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:35,781
Frank doesn't like to make
the slightest remark that might lose him

834
00:47:35,782 --> 00:47:38,044
people's regard or affection.

835
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,882
If anything has to be said
that might cause antagonism,

836
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:45,844
well, that's my job.

837
00:47:54,384 --> 00:47:57,344
I hate to say this, Mrs. Elgin,
but I hired a performer.

838
00:47:57,345 --> 00:48:01,860
A good performer. I may want him
without his sisters, cousins and aunts.

839
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,322
I never meant to interfere.

840
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,732
I was just sort of offering myself
as sort of liaison officer...

841
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:12,985
I have no problems with Frank.
Don't make any where they don't exist.

842
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:16,655
Before this is over, Mr. Dodd,
you may face a couple of beauties.

843
00:48:16,656 --> 00:48:18,418
Is that a threat?

844
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:20,526
No.

845
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,424
It's just a simple statement
based on experience.

846
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:29,471
Whether you like it or not, Frank's weak.
He's a leaner.

847
00:48:30,128 --> 00:48:32,932
And I happen to be the one he leans on.

848
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:36,394
The good, strong helpmate.

849
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,303
Did it ever occur to you
that you and your strength

850
00:48:39,304 --> 00:48:41,764
might be the very reason he is weak?

851
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:43,974
I don't like strong women, Mrs. Elgin.

852
00:48:43,975 --> 00:48:46,905
I'm not here to audition
for you, Mr. Dodd.

853
00:48:47,937 --> 00:48:50,575
I'm here for the same reason you are,

854
00:48:51,524 --> 00:48:55,330
to do everything in my power
to make him a success in this.

855
00:48:56,446 --> 00:49:00,074
I want to see Frank stand
on his own two feet again

856
00:49:00,075 --> 00:49:01,950
for very personal reasons.

857
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,454
Then don't overplay your hand.
Frank can go anywhere from here,

858
00:49:05,455 --> 00:49:07,550
other shows, right to the top again.

859
00:49:07,707 --> 00:49:10,376
Or he may go back to that smelly room
over that cheap restaurant,

860
00:49:10,377 --> 00:49:12,430
and you right along with him!

861
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,385
Say, I got that line mix-up
all straightened out.

862
00:49:19,386 --> 00:49:20,552
It wasn't my fault at all.

863
00:49:20,553 --> 00:49:22,554
It was Helen's.
She was throwing me the wrong cue.

864
00:49:22,555 --> 00:49:24,150
I'm glad you got it fixed.

865
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:28,363
Say, Frank, I noticed the understudy
hanging around backstage tonight.

866
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:31,480
- That bother you?
- Me? No.

867
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:34,953
Never even noticed. Besides, how else
is he gonna learn his business?

868
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:42,418
Is that you, Georgie?

869
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,535
Yes.

870
00:49:44,536 --> 00:49:45,964
Are you coming in?

871
00:49:47,038 --> 00:49:48,414
In a minute.

872
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:51,041
I just want to get a breath of fresh air.

873
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:54,013
Well, I can't come out.
I'm still a little soggy.

874
00:49:55,547 --> 00:49:58,309
Well, come on, give.
What'd they say about the dresser?

875
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:00,311
You'll get him.

876
00:50:00,635 --> 00:50:04,732
Well, looks like they got a little respect
for the old man after all.

877
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:10,863
Yes, they have respect for you, Frank.

878
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:13,783
Well, I'll be out in a second.

879
00:50:34,043 --> 00:50:35,794
It's a different kind of a show, isn't it?

880
00:50:35,795 --> 00:50:38,672
Yes. It confused me in the beginning,
but I'm enjoying it now.

881
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:41,175
It's a beautiful production.
Must have cost a fortune.

882
00:50:41,176 --> 00:50:43,552
I'll bet the costumes alone cost $50,000.

883
00:50:43,553 --> 00:50:46,149
I think it's the most exciting thing
I've seen in years.

884
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:49,444
- Where did you get it?
- George gave it to me for my birthday.

885
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:54,396
Henry, I'm positive you've
seen him before, years ago,

886
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:56,690
in that show
that all took place in Central Park.

887
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:57,983
Is he the same one?

888
00:50:57,984 --> 00:51:01,372
- So easygoing and likable, isn't he?
- Yes.

889
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:20,714
You catching cold?

890
00:51:20,715 --> 00:51:22,393
That's all I need.

891
00:51:22,884 --> 00:51:26,595
You're probably smoking too much.
Try and go to sleep, Frank.

892
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:28,775
I want to see the review
in the morning paper first.

893
00:51:28,973 --> 00:51:31,558
You can see it at breakfast.
You need sleep.

894
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,405
I can't sleep until I know
what they thought of me.

895
00:51:34,687 --> 00:51:36,980
What time do they deliver
the morning paper around here anyhow?

896
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:38,660
In the afternoon?

897
00:51:38,983 --> 00:51:41,860
Don't know why they
picked this place to open in.

898
00:51:41,861 --> 00:51:45,875
Playing to that audience
is like getting locked in a deep freeze.

899
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:52,298
- Just came in, Mr. Elgin.
- Thank you.

900
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,652
I'll get you another sleeping pill.

901
00:52:45,808 --> 00:52:46,933
Hello.

902
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:48,769
The bellboy said
he just took you a paper, Frank,

903
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,812
so I didn't think I'd be waking you.

904
00:52:50,813 --> 00:52:54,274
Now just remember the only important
ones are the New York notices.

905
00:52:54,275 --> 00:52:55,745
Yeah, I...

906
00:52:56,527 --> 00:52:59,655
I don't worry none about
these out-of-town critics.

907
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:01,667
Nah, they don't bother me any.

908
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:09,258
Georgie was a little upset,
but I reminded her <i>of</i> Lonesome <i>Town.</i>

909
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:12,959
Yeah, the Philadelphia critics
murdered us,

910
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,878
but we got up to New York,
we were a smash.

911
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:18,173
Well, we've got five weeks
to rewrite, change and polish.

912
00:53:18,174 --> 00:53:20,884
And believe me, opening night
in New York, it'll be great.

913
00:53:20,885 --> 00:53:22,928
<i>But, Frank, let's not kid ourselves.</i>

914
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:26,223
<i>It's gonna take an awful lot of work
on everybody's part.</i>

915
00:53:26,224 --> 00:53:27,974
Now, get some sleep.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

916
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:30,018
Rehearsal in the afternoon,
performance tomorrow night,

917
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:32,270
and then production stills after that.

918
00:53:32,271 --> 00:53:34,033
So, get all the rest you can, will you?

919
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:36,285
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Okay, good night.

920
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:45,409
The dame in this paper
puts her finger on it.

921
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:46,610
Right on it.

922
00:53:47,453 --> 00:53:53,010
She says, "Elgin lacks authority
in the role that cries for it."

923
00:53:53,376 --> 00:53:55,179
No authority. That's it.

924
00:53:55,336 --> 00:53:57,723
You know why he lacks authority?

925
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:00,893
Because his wife has too much of it.

926
00:54:02,343 --> 00:54:04,272
She's got to go back to New York,
Cookie.

927
00:54:05,138 --> 00:54:08,192
I think we ought to make it
transportation for two.

928
00:54:09,308 --> 00:54:11,893
If you don't like what I'm doing
or the way I'm doing it,

929
00:54:11,894 --> 00:54:14,073
you can make it transportation for three.

930
00:54:18,568 --> 00:54:21,747
Now, we were discussing that scene
in front of the town hall.

931
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:25,365
I think we go past the climax.

932
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:27,712
Let's try cutting this scene
here tomorrow night.

933
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:35,041
Over a little more.

934
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:38,139
All right, everybody out front keep quiet!

935
00:54:38,463 --> 00:54:42,560
Okay, now, sit down and keep quiet,
otherwise we're gonna be here all night!

936
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,176
Now, settle down.

937
00:54:44,177 --> 00:54:46,564
- Johnny?
- All right, here we go.

938
00:54:48,306 --> 00:54:49,506
Steady!

939
00:54:50,475 --> 00:54:52,559
- Hold it!
- Pardon me. Okay, go ahead.

940
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,760
Hold it!

941
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:55,520
Thank you.

942
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:58,034
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold those positions for a second.

943
00:54:58,149 --> 00:54:59,816
I want to change one thing here.

944
00:54:59,817 --> 00:55:01,329
While Frank is speaking,

945
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:03,195
instead of you people
looking at each other,

946
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:04,874
I want you to look directly at him.

947
00:55:05,114 --> 00:55:06,698
And no movement.

948
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:08,950
I don't want anything
that will distract the audience

949
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:10,911
from keeping their focus on him.

950
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:12,924
He's got to be
the dead center of attention.

951
00:55:14,499 --> 00:55:15,699
You...

952
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:18,387
You really think
it would be better that way?

953
00:55:19,629 --> 00:55:22,214
I thought it'd be kind of nice,
be natural,

954
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:25,091
if I was just sort of in the crowd here.

955
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:27,219
No, no. It's all wrong, Frank.
I saw it tonight.

956
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,148
The words lose importance.

957
00:55:29,263 --> 00:55:32,516
After all, this character's asking
these people to put their faith in him,

958
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:33,975
to trust him.

959
00:55:33,976 --> 00:55:36,645
He's promising to make
their dreams a reality.

960
00:55:36,646 --> 00:55:39,064
He's accepting
the responsibility for their future,

961
00:55:39,065 --> 00:55:40,941
and it's got to be a lot more important.

962
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:42,567
Believe me, it'll be a lot better.

963
00:55:42,568 --> 00:55:45,414
All right, we'll rehearse it tomorrow.
I just wanted to tell you about it.

964
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:48,532
Frank. Frank, we got one more shot.

965
00:55:48,533 --> 00:55:50,419
Where you're here looking at the poster.

966
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:54,465
Okay, yell when you're ready.

967
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:58,761
Now, this is color.
Turn your head towards the poster.

968
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,973
- Would you look at the poster, Frank?
- Yeah, sure.

969
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:05,882
There you are. Hold it. Steady.

970
00:56:05,883 --> 00:56:08,635
- Hold it.
<i>- Put your hands up on the record.</i>

971
00:56:08,636 --> 00:56:11,232
- Hold it.
<i>- Hold it.</i>

972
00:56:16,227 --> 00:56:17,863
Frank, what's the matter?

973
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:21,158
I got a cough.

974
00:56:22,149 --> 00:56:24,787
I got some stuff in the room.
I'll be right back.

975
00:56:33,286 --> 00:56:35,381
- All finished?
- No.

976
00:56:48,217 --> 00:56:50,980
Frank, I don't like
that cough syrup you bought.

977
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:53,138
Why not? It's a buck a bottle.

978
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,765
Well, "buck a bottle"
is a jim-dandy slogan,

979
00:56:55,766 --> 00:56:58,268
but you can read labels
as well as the next one.

980
00:56:58,269 --> 00:57:00,614
That's got 22% alcohol in it.

981
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:04,118
I'll get you some lemon and honey
in the morning.

982
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,778
Cook didn't come back
after the show, did he?

983
00:57:08,779 --> 00:57:09,979
No, he didn't.

984
00:57:11,365 --> 00:57:14,045
Well, I'm glad I got that
two-weeks clause in there.

985
00:57:15,077 --> 00:57:16,453
I can quit anytime I want.

986
00:57:16,454 --> 00:57:18,382
Why should I care? They don't seem to.

987
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,053
Producer doesn't come back
second night after the show.

988
00:57:22,627 --> 00:57:24,377
Frank, leave the bottle here.

989
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:26,046
I need it for my cough.

990
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:27,380
Leave it here.

991
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:29,018
But I need it!

992
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:35,505
Georgie.

993
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,902
I need it.

994
00:57:57,286 --> 00:57:59,090
- Frank's onstage.
- I know.

995
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:01,383
I want to talk to you.

996
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:06,388
The last time we talked, Mr. Dodd,
you reduced me to tears.

997
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:09,642
I promise you it won't happen again.

998
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:12,592
As a matter of fact, I'm glad you're here.

999
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,928
At the risk of being
considered a saboteur,

1000
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:16,680
I think you ought to know
he's getting a cold

1001
00:58:16,681 --> 00:58:18,223
and he shouldn't be kept up this late.

1002
00:58:18,224 --> 00:58:19,693
We need production stills.

1003
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:21,184
- How's his spirit?
- Low.

1004
00:58:21,185 --> 00:58:23,030
- Why?
- Ask the Boston critics.

1005
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:28,108
For the last month, I've spent between
10 and 15 hours a day with Frank.

1006
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,318
Nothing ever bothers him
except through your mouth.

1007
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:31,403
Why?

1008
00:58:31,404 --> 00:58:33,863
We've been through all of that before.

1009
00:58:33,864 --> 00:58:36,074
Either he laughs and makes bad jokes

1010
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:39,744
or he sits in silence
and rots away inside.

1011
00:58:39,745 --> 00:58:43,008
But either way, for your edification,
he's heading for a bender.

1012
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:48,514
Why is it that women always think they
understand men better than men do?

1013
00:58:49,588 --> 00:58:51,600
Maybe because they live with them.

1014
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,855
If you're not careful, you're going to
have him full of whiskey before morning.

1015
00:58:56,178 --> 00:58:58,930
He's getting a cold and that's
a respectable surface reason

1016
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:00,640
for any drinker to jump down the well.

1017
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:02,611
Why work so hard at this marriage?

1018
00:59:02,768 --> 00:59:04,310
You make him tense and uneasy.

1019
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:06,813
You never stop handling him, and now,
you're trying to handle me, too!

1020
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:10,244
And don't think I couldn't after handling
a cunning drunkard for 10 years!

1021
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:14,821
If you had any compassion
or love whatsoever for this man,

1022
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:16,948
you could never call him
a cunning drunkard.

1023
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:18,825
Maybe I have a greater love for the truth.

1024
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:21,494
That's what he is. I'm a drunkard's wife.
That's the truth, too.

1025
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:23,955
And I think it's high time
you stopped looking at everything

1026
00:59:23,956 --> 00:59:27,167
as if it were a musical comedy,
and faced a little bit of it yourself!

1027
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:30,211
To be frank,
I find you slightly grotesque, Mrs. Elgin.

1028
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:32,641
You came here to tell me something.
What is it?

1029
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,103
I've been fighting with Cook.

1030
00:59:37,136 --> 00:59:39,095
He's got
a first-class replacement for Frank

1031
00:59:39,096 --> 00:59:40,889
and a lot of money to protect.

1032
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:42,318
I think Frank will improve.

1033
00:59:42,516 --> 00:59:44,028
Cook thinks he won't.

1034
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:46,394
Well, he won't
unless you get out of town.

1035
00:59:46,395 --> 00:59:47,562
You might be sorry.

1036
00:59:47,563 --> 00:59:48,938
That's a risk I can't wait to take.

1037
00:59:48,939 --> 00:59:50,231
- He'll be helpless.
- I'll help him.

1038
00:59:50,232 --> 00:59:51,357
You?

1039
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:53,704
You wouldn't know where to begin.

1040
00:59:55,654 --> 00:59:58,334
I'll begin by not calling him
a cunning drunkard.

1041
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:01,034
I'll give him pride and confidence

1042
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:03,495
by occasionally rejoicing
in his God-given talents,

1043
01:00:03,496 --> 01:00:06,175
instead of constantly reminding him
of his weaknesses.

1044
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:10,418
I'll let him face a decision without first
filling him full of doubts and fears,

1045
01:00:10,419 --> 01:00:13,463
and I won't stifle him
with my own inadequacy and bitterness.

1046
01:00:13,464 --> 01:00:15,298
I might have to
bend the truth here and there,

1047
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,342
but I'll get a performance out of him.

1048
01:00:17,343 --> 01:00:19,969
And that's the difference
between us, Mr. Dodd.

1049
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,722
You want him to become
the actor he once was.

1050
01:00:22,723 --> 01:00:24,318
I'm his wife.

1051
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:28,364
I want him just once more
as the man he once was,

1052
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:33,244
able to stand on his own two feet
and face responsibility, and...

1053
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:35,693
And you don't do that
by bending the truth!

1054
01:00:35,694 --> 01:00:39,531
And you certainly don't do it by stripping
him of every vestige of self-respect.

1055
01:00:39,532 --> 01:00:42,283
I'm warning you, I'm gonna fight you
as hard as I can for this man.

1056
01:00:42,284 --> 01:00:45,370
Not too hard.
I may let you have him.

1057
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:49,593
No. No, you want him wholly
and utterly dependent.

1058
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:54,129
You realized long ago with all
your fine background and breeding

1059
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,975
you were a failure.

1060
01:00:56,132 --> 01:00:58,508
But it gave you a reason for being,
a feeling of power

1061
01:00:58,509 --> 01:01:00,688
to control and manipulate
someone else's life.

1062
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:02,971
And worst of all, you do it
in the name of love.

1063
01:01:02,972 --> 01:01:05,442
You're as phony to me
as an opera soprano!

1064
01:01:09,728 --> 01:01:13,117
Did I forget to tell you I'm proud?

1065
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:16,954
Make up your mind.

1066
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:22,543
Either you go to New York alone
or you both go.

1067
01:01:27,037 --> 01:01:28,299
I'll go.

1068
01:01:30,082 --> 01:01:31,593
On one condition.

1069
01:01:33,627 --> 01:01:36,181
Let me tell Frank in my own way,

1070
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,767
in my own time.

1071
01:01:39,758 --> 01:01:43,022
As long as you're on that train
by tomorrow night.

1072
01:01:47,558 --> 01:01:50,435
Traffic's a little heavy throughout.
They ought to put a light out there.

1073
01:01:50,436 --> 01:01:52,948
- Finished?
- Yeah, they're all wrapped up.

1074
01:01:56,609 --> 01:01:58,454
- Frank.
- Yeah?

1075
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:02,708
I'd like to run through that new scene
after the matinee tomorrow.

1076
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:06,284
- You tired?
- Tired? Me?

1077
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:07,952
How can you be tired,
when you're back in the harness

1078
01:02:07,953 --> 01:02:10,090
playing a part
you've waited for all your life?

1079
01:02:10,664 --> 01:02:12,290
Your energy was low again tonight.

1080
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:15,512
Yeah, I know. It's this cold,
but I'll get rid of it in a day or two.

1081
01:02:15,753 --> 01:02:18,755
- You sure it's not nerves?
- Nerves? You kidding?

1082
01:02:18,756 --> 01:02:21,216
Why don't you tell him
what's bothering you?

1083
01:02:21,217 --> 01:02:22,675
Well, what's bothering me?

1084
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:24,594
Cook and the notices, for instance.

1085
01:02:24,595 --> 01:02:26,638
That? Well,

1086
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,807
I just wondered why he didn't
come around backstage after the show.

1087
01:02:29,808 --> 01:02:31,935
Is he mad or something?

1088
01:02:31,936 --> 01:02:34,604
Might as well be honest about it.
Those weren't exactly money notices.

1089
01:02:34,605 --> 01:02:38,160
Frank, Mr. Dodd believes in you.

1090
01:02:38,984 --> 01:02:42,153
I can't help you if you're worried.
He can.

1091
01:02:42,154 --> 01:02:43,957
But I'm not worried.

1092
01:02:44,073 --> 01:02:47,325
Did you or did you not
tell me 10 minutes ago right in this room

1093
01:02:47,326 --> 01:02:49,129
that you wanted to hand in your notice?

1094
01:02:50,412 --> 01:02:52,633
Well, I was just ribbing you, honey.

1095
01:02:52,998 --> 01:02:55,708
Guy's got to be careful around here.
You can't open your mouth.

1096
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:57,679
Gotta watch your step, I guess.

1097
01:02:58,504 --> 01:03:01,422
Your wife says
she's thinking of returning to New York.

1098
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:03,352
I told you nothing of the sort!

1099
01:03:09,223 --> 01:03:10,943
What do you mean, New York?

1100
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:13,559
We can talk about it later.

1101
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,115
Would you leave us alone
for a few minutes, Mrs. Elgin?

1102
01:03:28,158 --> 01:03:30,337
Now, Frank, let's get one thing straight.

1103
01:03:31,912 --> 01:03:33,112
What is that?

1104
01:03:33,372 --> 01:03:37,542
It's cough syrup
with pine tar and cherries.

1105
01:03:37,543 --> 01:03:39,138
A whole bush in a bottle, you know?

1106
01:03:39,378 --> 01:03:41,640
This stuff is laced with 22% alcohol.

1107
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:43,767
Alcohol.

1108
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:47,093
Gee, I told Georgie to just get me
a little something

1109
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:48,261
to loosen up my throat.

1110
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:50,179
Don't you know
what these little appetizers can do?

1111
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,598
Well, I suppose she didn't even bother
to look at the label, Bernie.

1112
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:53,902
Or maybe she did.

1113
01:03:54,518 --> 01:03:56,905
She's jealous of the show
and jealous of me.

1114
01:03:57,396 --> 01:03:59,981
This is how far she'd go.
Far enough to kick you off the wagon!

1115
01:03:59,982 --> 01:04:02,358
Now, Bernie, I know she's high-strung
and difficult, but...

1116
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:03,912
I want her back in New York.

1117
01:04:04,653 --> 01:04:06,195
We've got
a lot of hard work ahead of us,

1118
01:04:06,196 --> 01:04:09,168
and I haven't time
to outmaneuver frustrated females!

1119
01:04:12,703 --> 01:04:14,756
Go on back to the hotel
and get a good night's sleep.

1120
01:04:15,456 --> 01:04:17,801
I want you fresh and clear tomorrow.

1121
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:25,517
Mrs. Elgin?

1122
01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:30,803
Frank knows exactly how I feel,

1123
01:04:30,804 --> 01:04:33,348
and I think he appreciates
what has to be done.

1124
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:34,549
See you tomorrow, Frank.

1125
01:04:34,683 --> 01:04:35,883
Good night.

1126
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:43,994
He can be pretty arrogant and insulting,
can't he?

1127
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:47,623
Well, he had no right
to treat you like that.

1128
01:04:48,197 --> 01:04:50,083
Did you tell him that?

1129
01:04:53,786 --> 01:04:55,631
I poured it in the sink.

1130
01:04:57,373 --> 01:04:59,676
If you don't believe me,
why don't you go smell it?

1131
01:05:03,337 --> 01:05:04,973
Where's the other bottle, Frank?

1132
01:05:05,422 --> 01:05:08,393
- What other bottle?
- Frank, I'm tired. Don't play peekaboo.

1133
01:05:08,509 --> 01:05:10,301
Where's the other bottle of that syrup?

1134
01:05:10,302 --> 01:05:11,813
I didn't buy another bottle.

1135
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:15,943
I wish you'd take
my word for something for a change.

1136
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:17,642
Never mind.

1137
01:05:17,643 --> 01:05:19,571
Never mind. I give up.
I'm not going to look.

1138
01:05:24,817 --> 01:05:26,453
Georgie, I want to apologize.

1139
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:30,321
- He had no right to take that attitude.
- Stop putting on a front.

1140
01:05:30,322 --> 01:05:32,657
- Who's putting on a front?
- You're putting on a front!

1141
01:05:32,658 --> 01:05:35,379
And you lie! You lie, you lie!

1142
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:42,834
You going back to New York?

1143
01:05:42,835 --> 01:05:44,680
I don't know why not.

1144
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:48,016
You want to leave me, don't you?

1145
01:05:48,424 --> 01:05:51,300
At the moment,
all I want is for you to get dressed

1146
01:05:51,301 --> 01:05:52,813
so we can get out of here.

1147
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:55,649
Who's in New York?

1148
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:58,277
Who's the guy you want to get back to?

1149
01:05:58,684 --> 01:06:00,059
Frank, I'm warning you.

1150
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,114
I'm going to hit you
with the first thing I pick up.

1151
01:06:02,312 --> 01:06:03,604
Now get dressed!

1152
01:06:03,605 --> 01:06:05,022
Why don't you go
if you're in such a hurry?

1153
01:06:05,023 --> 01:06:06,232
Go on, go ahead!

1154
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:08,453
I'll take a walk, get something to eat.

1155
01:06:09,528 --> 01:06:11,237
It's not gonna do your cold any good.

1156
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:14,115
Well, let them worry about it.
And I told you what you could do, too.

1157
01:06:14,116 --> 01:06:15,908
Do you want me to go?
Is that what you want?

1158
01:06:15,909 --> 01:06:18,578
Yes. Yes, if you're in
such a great big hurry, go on!

1159
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:21,300
You got the key to the room?
Well, keep it.

1160
01:06:21,457 --> 01:06:22,874
I'll get another one from the hotel.

1161
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,720
And don't wake me up
when you come in.

1162
01:06:25,002 --> 01:06:28,056
Who knows,
I may be having a happy dream.

1163
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:05,875
Sixty-five, 75.

1164
01:07:05,876 --> 01:07:07,763
- And that's for you.
- Thanks, Doc.

1165
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:12,059
Do you like me?

1166
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:16,063
Doc, I think you're one
of the most likable guys I ever seen.

1167
01:07:16,261 --> 01:07:18,137
Come on, Jackie, sing something!

1168
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:20,692
- How about <i>Love</i> and <i>Learn?</i>
- Okay, I'll sing if you be quiet.

1169
01:07:20,974 --> 01:07:22,725
Yeah, <i>Love and Learn,</i> Jackie.

1170
01:07:22,726 --> 01:07:24,894
All right, all right. Simmer down.

1171
01:07:24,895 --> 01:07:26,531
It's my turn to holler.

1172
01:07:28,148 --> 01:07:30,077
<i>Love and learn</i>

1173
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,537
<i>Love and learn</i>

1174
01:07:32,653 --> 01:07:37,250
<i>It's a breeze, let it burn</i>

1175
01:07:37,616 --> 01:07:42,130
<i>You retreat, then return</i>

1176
01:07:42,412 --> 01:07:47,219
<i>You may have climbed
the tree of knowledge</i>

1177
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:52,380
<i>But when you love you really learn</i>

1178
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:56,770
<i>Love and learn, learn a lot</i>

1179
01:07:57,177 --> 01:08:01,608
<i>It's the be and end-all, then it's not</i>

1180
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:06,655
<i>It's a dream, it's a plot</i>

1181
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:11,952
<i>It's something out of seventh heaven</i>

1182
01:08:12,109 --> 01:08:15,539
<i>Something misbegot</i>

1183
01:08:16,154 --> 01:08:20,950
<i>Each morning when I count
my blessings</i>

1184
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:25,424
<i>They tally up to none</i>

1185
01:08:25,747 --> 01:08:30,793
<i>- I've arrived at this...
- Well, this state of bliss</i>

1186
01:08:30,794 --> 01:08:34,672
<i>Is somewhat overdone</i>

1187
01:08:34,673 --> 01:08:36,810
Well, go, Dad, go.

1188
01:08:36,925 --> 01:08:39,385
<i>Love and learn</i>

1189
01:08:39,386 --> 01:08:42,190
<i>Weep and sing</i>

1190
01:08:42,764 --> 01:08:45,141
<i>Till the final day of reckoning</i>

1191
01:08:45,142 --> 01:08:46,934
What about this guy.

1192
01:08:46,935 --> 01:08:51,564
<i>But when arms start to cling</i>

1193
01:08:51,565 --> 01:08:56,611
<i>With the thrills, kisses bring</i>

1194
01:08:56,612 --> 01:09:02,868
<i>What you have learned is
Is you haven't learned a thing</i>

1195
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:05,213
- Take me home, Dad.
- Go on, girl.

1196
01:09:05,537 --> 01:09:08,164
<i>It's a dream and it's a plot</i>

1197
01:09:08,165 --> 01:09:10,791
<i>Oh, what you thought it was, was not</i>

1198
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:13,044
<i>But when arms begin to cling</i>

1199
01:09:13,045 --> 01:09:16,391
<i>And angels start to sing</i>

1200
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:19,352
<i>What you have learned is</i>

1201
01:09:20,844 --> 01:09:27,726
<i>Is you haven't learned a thing</i>

1202
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:43,543
Hey, aren't you Frank Elgin?

1203
01:09:47,204 --> 01:09:48,790
Yeah, I used to be.

1204
01:09:48,997 --> 01:09:51,259
Not a word,
or I'll tell them you're Harpo Marx.

1205
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:54,418
Jackie, <i>The Pump Song.</i>
Do <i>The Pump Song.</i>

1206
01:09:54,419 --> 01:09:56,295
Look, I'm tired. Dance a while.

1207
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:58,058
Order up. Buy something already.

1208
01:10:01,343 --> 01:10:03,844
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1209
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:05,440
- Have another?
- Yeah.

1210
01:10:05,972 --> 01:10:07,609
Give me a double.

1211
01:10:09,768 --> 01:10:12,030
Pour, pour. Go ahead. Fill it up.

1212
01:10:14,106 --> 01:10:15,815
Sorry about that drink.

1213
01:10:15,816 --> 01:10:18,109
It's all right.
Could've happened to anybody.

1214
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,538
Just an accident.

1215
01:10:21,571 --> 01:10:24,042
Yeah, just an accident.

1216
01:10:25,659 --> 01:10:27,170
That's what the papers said.

1217
01:10:28,412 --> 01:10:30,632
You're right.
It could've happened to anybody.

1218
01:10:31,581 --> 01:10:33,593
Just an accident.

1219
01:11:18,587 --> 01:11:20,140
Come in.

1220
01:11:20,589 --> 01:11:21,922
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1221
01:11:21,923 --> 01:11:23,123
How's it going?

1222
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,010
- We got out 23 minutes.
- That's fine.

1223
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:29,054
Now, if we cut that chorus in half
in front of the courthouse,

1224
01:11:29,055 --> 01:11:32,277
- what'll that give us?
- Save another seven and a half minutes.

1225
01:11:32,559 --> 01:11:34,810
Good. Good.
That's first act, where we need it.

1226
01:11:34,811 --> 01:11:36,103
Hello?

1227
01:11:36,104 --> 01:11:37,304
Yeah.

1228
01:11:39,065 --> 01:11:40,368
What? When?

1229
01:11:43,528 --> 01:11:44,779
Oh, no.

1230
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,708
So, I think you better come right down.

1231
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:48,960
Yes, I'll wait for you.

1232
01:11:52,496 --> 01:11:54,663
Here's his keys, his belt.

1233
01:11:54,664 --> 01:11:56,665
I know, I know.

1234
01:11:56,666 --> 01:11:58,720
Seventy-five, 85,

1235
01:11:59,252 --> 01:12:00,597
90.

1236
01:12:01,671 --> 01:12:03,767
Here, here's your fine, Officer.

1237
01:12:07,844 --> 01:12:09,345
You promised me the other night

1238
01:12:09,346 --> 01:12:12,264
I'd have a couple of big problems
with Frank before this was over.

1239
01:12:12,265 --> 01:12:13,933
I see you made good your threat.

1240
01:12:13,934 --> 01:12:16,905
I didn't threaten you. I warned you.

1241
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:20,314
When he hadn't come in
by 3:00 or 4:00 this morning,

1242
01:12:20,315 --> 01:12:21,732
why didn't you call me?

1243
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:23,984
Suppose he had been
with another woman?

1244
01:12:23,985 --> 01:12:26,581
You're being deliberately evasive.
You must've known...

1245
01:12:35,163 --> 01:12:36,424
Sit down, Frank.

1246
01:12:45,799 --> 01:12:47,435
Get me some water, Georgie.

1247
01:12:53,306 --> 01:12:54,859
What happened, Frank?

1248
01:12:56,226 --> 01:12:58,227
Sit up! Don't act as though
I'm beating you! Sit up!

1249
01:12:58,228 --> 01:13:00,813
I'm sorry, Bernie.

1250
01:13:00,814 --> 01:13:03,326
- What happened?
- I don't know. I just...

1251
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:05,568
What happened after
I left you last night?

1252
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:08,112
Georgie and I had a fight,
and I don't know.

1253
01:13:08,113 --> 01:13:09,313
I thought so.

1254
01:13:09,614 --> 01:13:12,324
She certainly picked a fine time
to start yelling and screaming.

1255
01:13:12,325 --> 01:13:13,742
Wasn't her fault at all, it was mine.

1256
01:13:13,743 --> 01:13:15,703
Of course it was your fault,
but stop protecting her!

1257
01:13:15,704 --> 01:13:17,496
She's weak, Bernie. She's so weak.

1258
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:20,291
She's driven you to drink for 10 years,
and you call her weak?

1259
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:22,918
You could be magnificent in this part,
but not when she's around.

1260
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:25,588
- She goes back to New York.
- Bernie, I can't do that.

1261
01:13:25,589 --> 01:13:28,476
- I don't know what she'd do.
- She goes back this morning.

1262
01:13:29,175 --> 01:13:31,302
- She's weak, Bernie. She's awful weak.
- I'll talk to her.

1263
01:13:31,303 --> 01:13:33,023
If we go on together,
you move in with me.

1264
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:36,609
- Cook doesn't want me.
- I'm not so sure I want you!

1265
01:13:37,058 --> 01:13:38,611
Whatever you say, Bernie.

1266
01:13:39,185 --> 01:13:40,613
You decide. I...

1267
01:13:55,076 --> 01:13:56,827
Frank stays, you go.

1268
01:13:56,828 --> 01:13:59,049
The management will take care
of your expenses.

1269
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:00,831
Frank may follow you
in a couple of days.

1270
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:02,124
I'm not sure.

1271
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:03,720
Right now, he's moving in with me.

1272
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:05,889
Crisp as lettuce, aren't you?

1273
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:10,060
Do you want me to go, Frank?

1274
01:14:18,183 --> 01:14:19,903
All right, I'll go and pack.

1275
01:14:20,685 --> 01:14:23,490
Before you go, tell Frank
he has nothing to worry about.

1276
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:27,399
He thinks you may go drastic.
It's happened before, I understand.

1277
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,193
- Bernie, I...
- What's happened before?

1278
01:14:29,194 --> 01:14:31,236
Phony suicide attempts.

1279
01:14:31,237 --> 01:14:32,780
Bernie, she...

1280
01:14:32,781 --> 01:14:34,042
Mr. Dodd.

1281
01:14:34,908 --> 01:14:37,493
When I was a child,
we had a town idiot.

1282
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:40,788
He kept insisting that elephant tusks
came from piano keys,

1283
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:43,093
but he had nothing on you.

1284
01:14:47,045 --> 01:14:49,974
Suicide attempts are Frank's department.

1285
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:07,408
Show me your wrists, Frank.

1286
01:15:08,942 --> 01:15:10,411
Show me your wrists!

1287
01:15:42,308 --> 01:15:44,946
Did you once set fire to a hotel suite?

1288
01:15:46,396 --> 01:15:48,867
He told you that?

1289
01:15:51,151 --> 01:15:53,163
Was I a hopeless drunk?

1290
01:15:54,112 --> 01:15:56,124
Did I have fits of depression?

1291
01:15:57,032 --> 01:15:58,710
Was I possessive?

1292
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:02,630
Did I have to have a nurse watch me
when he was onstage?

1293
01:16:05,248 --> 01:16:07,760
Didn't you recognize any of it?

1294
01:16:09,294 --> 01:16:10,961
That was his big speech

1295
01:16:10,962 --> 01:16:15,476
in one of the plays you admired him in
when you were a hatcheck boy.

1296
01:16:28,772 --> 01:16:30,533
Larry.

1297
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:36,372
Do you think the understudy
can play the matinee?

1298
01:16:37,655 --> 01:16:39,334
Yeah, I think so.

1299
01:16:40,825 --> 01:16:42,659
Pay the fine and damages.

1300
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:45,089
This is a receipt for his coat
and wallet and the rest.

1301
01:16:45,538 --> 01:16:47,300
Take him back to the hotel.

1302
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:50,511
No, wait a minute.

1303
01:16:51,377 --> 01:16:53,837
They see him in the lobby,
it'll be all over the papers.

1304
01:16:53,838 --> 01:16:56,465
Take him back to the theater
and let him sleep it off there.

1305
01:16:56,466 --> 01:16:58,144
Come on, Frank.

1306
01:17:02,514 --> 01:17:03,847
Georgie, I...

1307
01:17:03,848 --> 01:17:07,153
Go on, Frank.
I won't leave without seeing you.

1308
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:10,323
Tell Cook I'll be along in a few minutes.

1309
01:17:22,826 --> 01:17:24,026
May I smoke?

1310
01:17:24,953 --> 01:17:26,422
May you smoke?

1311
01:17:27,455 --> 01:17:30,718
What is that supposed to be,
homage to a lady?

1312
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:33,418
That'll never make me forgive you,
Mr. Dodd,

1313
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:34,806
for what you've said and done.

1314
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:39,852
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

1315
01:17:40,718 --> 01:17:42,480
I want information.

1316
01:17:43,388 --> 01:17:45,817
What about Frank?
What made him go to pieces?

1317
01:17:46,266 --> 01:17:48,820
The responsibility became
too much for him.

1318
01:17:49,269 --> 01:17:52,229
But in the beginning, why the lying,
why the cunning?

1319
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:53,741
He hates himself.

1320
01:17:53,898 --> 01:17:58,204
Consequently, he'll do or say anything
to be liked by others.

1321
01:18:00,071 --> 01:18:02,406
People like Frank ought
to have two votes.

1322
01:18:02,407 --> 01:18:05,837
Then they could mark their ballot
Democrat and Republican.

1323
01:18:06,035 --> 01:18:08,298
That way everybody would love them.

1324
01:18:09,038 --> 01:18:10,539
Was he always like that?

1325
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,759
No.

1326
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,846
No, he drank a little.

1327
01:18:15,378 --> 01:18:16,931
Wasn't too dependable.

1328
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:20,643
But that was
only a pathetic hint of frailty

1329
01:18:21,634 --> 01:18:23,855
in a wonderful glowing man.

1330
01:18:26,139 --> 01:18:27,973
That appeals to a lot of us.

1331
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:29,402
It did to me.

1332
01:18:30,101 --> 01:18:31,393
I was so young.

1333
01:18:31,394 --> 01:18:35,105
His weaknesses,
they seemed touching and sweet.

1334
01:18:35,106 --> 01:18:37,201
They made me love him more.

1335
01:18:40,153 --> 01:18:43,791
And then one day
he was walking with our son.

1336
01:18:45,033 --> 01:18:47,201
He let go of his hand, there was traffic,

1337
01:18:47,202 --> 01:18:50,673
looked the other way,
and the boy was killed.

1338
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:57,764
Ever since then,
Frank has acted like a murderer.

1339
01:18:58,546 --> 01:19:02,226
Guilt and repentance
and all that goes with it.

1340
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:08,149
But worse than that, he shunned
any responsibility like the plague.

1341
01:19:11,935 --> 01:19:13,738
It covered a pretty wide range.

1342
01:19:15,271 --> 01:19:16,783
Everything from...

1343
01:19:17,273 --> 01:19:19,994
From not wanting any more children to...

1344
01:19:21,694 --> 01:19:24,112
I know it must sound ludicrous
to anyone

1345
01:19:24,113 --> 01:19:26,417
who hasn't actually lived
through it, but it...

1346
01:19:27,283 --> 01:19:29,451
It got to the point that he...

1347
01:19:29,452 --> 01:19:32,340
He wouldn't even pick out
a coat or suit by himself.

1348
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:42,058
I don't know where
to begin to apologize, Mrs. Elgin.

1349
01:19:42,674 --> 01:19:45,520
You can begin
by not calling me Mrs. Elgin.

1350
01:19:47,428 --> 01:19:48,971
And you never left him.

1351
01:19:48,972 --> 01:19:50,983
Twice left. Twice returned.

1352
01:19:52,308 --> 01:19:53,820
He's a helpless child.

1353
01:19:55,728 --> 01:19:57,562
Anyone taking a cab to New York?

1354
01:19:57,563 --> 01:19:59,523
But if he's as helpless as you say...

1355
01:19:59,524 --> 01:20:01,733
He's not helpless now.

1356
01:20:01,734 --> 01:20:03,663
He has you, Mr. Dodd.

1357
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,654
He has to be watched and handled.

1358
01:20:05,655 --> 01:20:08,459
You're the only one that can do that.
I didn't know it before now.

1359
01:20:08,574 --> 01:20:10,837
Well, then maybe
you've learned something!

1360
01:20:10,952 --> 01:20:13,131
The man needs you.
He has to be watched.

1361
01:20:13,288 --> 01:20:17,749
You take on the job with waving banners
and 10 hours later, hand it back.

1362
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:20,377
You're telling me he has to be watched?

1363
01:20:20,378 --> 01:20:24,100
He has to be nursed and guarded
and coddled, but not by me!

1364
01:20:24,382 --> 01:20:28,396
I'm going back to New York to
the peace and comfort of a quiet room.

1365
01:20:28,886 --> 01:20:31,691
For the first time in years,
I won't have to wonder where he is.

1366
01:20:31,973 --> 01:20:35,434
He'll be in the strong,
sober hands of Bernie Dodd.

1367
01:20:35,435 --> 01:20:37,644
Can you stand him up on his feet again?

1368
01:20:37,645 --> 01:20:40,188
Because that's where
all my prayers have gone.

1369
01:20:40,189 --> 01:20:43,942
To see that one holy hour
when he can stand alone again.

1370
01:20:43,943 --> 01:20:46,873
- Listen to me.
- And I might forgive even you, Mr. Dodd.

1371
01:20:46,988 --> 01:20:49,917
If you can keep him up long enough
for me to get out from under.

1372
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:55,579
All I want is my own name and a
modest job to buy sugar for my coffee.

1373
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,831
- Will you...
- You can't believe that, can you?

1374
01:20:57,832 --> 01:21:01,335
You can't believe
that a woman is crazy out of her mind

1375
01:21:01,336 --> 01:21:04,015
to live alone in one room by herself!

1376
01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:07,049
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
- Why are you holding me?

1377
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:08,603
I said you're holding me!

1378
01:21:27,111 --> 01:21:31,542
How could you be so angry
at someone you didn't even know?

1379
01:21:35,703 --> 01:21:37,131
Maybe, I really wasn't.

1380
01:21:39,499 --> 01:21:42,970
Maybe, I screamed at you
to keep myself at an angry distance.

1381
01:21:44,629 --> 01:21:49,769
No one has looked at me as a woman
for years and years.

1382
01:21:52,053 --> 01:21:54,273
And I never knew
there was such a woman.

1383
01:21:56,265 --> 01:21:58,903
Loyal, steadfast.

1384
01:22:00,478 --> 01:22:02,114
And when I found her...

1385
01:22:08,528 --> 01:22:10,331
Now, I need your answer.

1386
01:22:11,864 --> 01:22:14,001
Do you think Frank can make it?

1387
01:22:16,285 --> 01:22:17,838
I don't know.

1388
01:22:19,997 --> 01:22:22,749
But I do know that if he doesn't
go through with this show,

1389
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,011
he'll never work again.

1390
01:22:24,877 --> 01:22:26,305
I'm sure of that.

1391
01:22:27,213 --> 01:22:29,308
You'll be taking a big chance.

1392
01:22:31,884 --> 01:22:34,230
They're the only ones worth taking.

1393
01:22:36,806 --> 01:22:39,193
But I can't unless you stay.

1394
01:22:40,643 --> 01:22:41,843
Will you?

1395
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,350
Yes.

1396
01:22:55,741 --> 01:22:57,253
You kissed me.

1397
01:23:00,496 --> 01:23:03,134
Don't let it give you any ideas,
Mr. Dodd.

1398
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:09,181
No, Mrs. Elgin.

1399
01:23:23,936 --> 01:23:25,281
It's more thoughtful.

1400
01:23:25,521 --> 01:23:27,992
You see, he's trying
to figure out an approach.

1401
01:23:28,858 --> 01:23:30,400
- Did you see Cook?
- No.

1402
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:32,652
He's in the box office
talking long-distance to Watson.

1403
01:23:32,653 --> 01:23:34,081
I haven't got time now.

1404
01:23:38,493 --> 01:23:39,993
I've been going over the part
with the understudy

1405
01:23:39,994 --> 01:23:41,328
and I think we can get by with him.

1406
01:23:41,329 --> 01:23:42,798
- You want to listen to him?
- Not now.

1407
01:23:50,421 --> 01:23:52,266
- How do you feel?
- Okay.

1408
01:23:53,466 --> 01:23:55,269
Larry got me some coffee.

1409
01:23:56,177 --> 01:23:58,898
- I'll be out of here in a minute.
- You don't have to get out.

1410
01:24:00,556 --> 01:24:02,485
All you have to do is get some sleep.

1411
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,268
But the understudy,
he's gonna want to get in here.

1412
01:24:05,269 --> 01:24:06,853
I've just listened to him read, Frank.

1413
01:24:06,854 --> 01:24:08,115
He's no good.

1414
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:11,202
- You'll have to play the matinee.
- No, no, Bernie.

1415
01:24:11,567 --> 01:24:13,329
Don't stick your neck out.

1416
01:24:15,363 --> 01:24:18,114
Listen, Frank, I'm in no mood
to cut my throat in public.

1417
01:24:18,115 --> 01:24:20,419
The understudy stinks, and
you're the only thing I've got around.

1418
01:24:20,576 --> 01:24:22,672
It's not just the matinee, Bernie.

1419
01:24:22,995 --> 01:24:25,080
I've been thinking.
You gotta replace me.

1420
01:24:25,081 --> 01:24:27,040
When you took this job
I promised you no pity.

1421
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:29,804
- And no pity it's going to be.
- I don't expect any!

1422
01:24:30,711 --> 01:24:32,640
I'm only warning you. Get rid of me.

1423
01:24:33,005 --> 01:24:34,517
Let me go back to New York.

1424
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:38,843
So you can tell the boys
at The Lambs Club

1425
01:24:38,844 --> 01:24:40,898
that you quit because
the part wasn't big enough?

1426
01:24:41,597 --> 01:24:43,150
No.

1427
01:24:43,808 --> 01:24:46,445
If you leave this show,
it'll only be for one reason.

1428
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:49,479
Because I fire you!

1429
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,899
Because I fire you for being
an unreliable, slobbering drunk!

1430
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,359
I know a lot of people who hire actors

1431
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,069
and that's what I'll tell
every one of them.

1432
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:57,904
And those I don't talk to, Cook does!

1433
01:24:57,905 --> 01:25:00,407
You don't understand.
It's not just this performance.

1434
01:25:00,408 --> 01:25:02,701
I can do a show for you.
I can keep on doing shows.

1435
01:25:02,702 --> 01:25:04,755
I've gone on
when I could hardly stand up.

1436
01:25:06,664 --> 01:25:08,801
It's not when I'm out there that it's bad.

1437
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:12,127
Well, this is just a matinee in Boston!
Suppose I do this to you in New York?

1438
01:25:12,128 --> 01:25:14,004
Suppose I don't show up on you
for a week? Then where are you?

1439
01:25:14,005 --> 01:25:15,130
Where are you?

1440
01:25:15,131 --> 01:25:17,799
You keep talking
as if I do this on purpose!

1441
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,353
I can't help it, Bernie!

1442
01:25:22,722 --> 01:25:25,015
In between shows,
in the night sometimes

1443
01:25:25,016 --> 01:25:26,777
when I start thinking about it, I...

1444
01:25:27,893 --> 01:25:29,363
You mean the accident?

1445
01:25:31,397 --> 01:25:32,772
Georgie told me about it.

1446
01:25:32,773 --> 01:25:34,608
Well, then you know
it hasn't been easy trying to...

1447
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:37,360
Why didn't you tell me
about the accident before we started?

1448
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:39,487
I don't know. I just didn't think...

1449
01:25:39,488 --> 01:25:41,114
You knew I wouldn't buy it.

1450
01:25:41,115 --> 01:25:42,490
And I don't buy it now.

1451
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:44,409
A crazy wife, yes,
because you knew I had one.

1452
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,120
- It was an accident.
- It was just a crutch and you know it!

1453
01:25:47,121 --> 01:25:49,664
You were getting older,
beginning to slip.

1454
01:25:49,665 --> 01:25:52,208
You didn't want to admit it,
so you started looking for excuses.

1455
01:25:52,209 --> 01:25:54,597
The accident was a perfect excuse!

1456
01:25:54,712 --> 01:25:57,683
Everybody expects a guy to take
a thing like that pretty hard.

1457
01:25:57,965 --> 01:26:00,091
So, you used it.
You played it to the hilt.

1458
01:26:00,092 --> 01:26:03,063
- No, no, Bernie.
- I'm right, and you know it!

1459
01:26:04,972 --> 01:26:07,026
You're pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

1460
01:26:08,768 --> 01:26:10,863
You don't know
what it means to be afraid, do you?

1461
01:26:11,354 --> 01:26:13,480
You're right up there
on top of the heap now.

1462
01:26:13,481 --> 01:26:16,149
Everything's rolling good for you,
but wait till you get a little older.

1463
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:18,943
Wait till you've had a couple of flops
and the people stop writing about you

1464
01:26:18,944 --> 01:26:20,278
and they stop talking about you.

1465
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:21,571
Then you'll get afraid.

1466
01:26:21,572 --> 01:26:23,615
Then you'll start
looking around for excuses, too.

1467
01:26:23,616 --> 01:26:25,742
I'm not blaming you.
I just want you to stop lying to yourself!

1468
01:26:25,743 --> 01:26:26,826
All right! All right!

1469
01:26:26,827 --> 01:26:29,256
Sure, everybody thought it was
because of the accident.

1470
01:26:30,956 --> 01:26:32,510
That's what I wanted them to think.

1471
01:26:34,418 --> 01:26:35,846
Because I was afraid.

1472
01:26:36,712 --> 01:26:38,933
Even when I was the biggest,
I was afraid.

1473
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:41,268
I've always been afraid.

1474
01:26:41,717 --> 01:26:43,395
I don't know why.

1475
01:26:44,387 --> 01:26:47,691
It was good to find
a respectable excuse for failure.

1476
01:26:48,891 --> 01:26:51,737
Sure, I could drink a little more.

1477
01:26:52,144 --> 01:26:54,031
Nobody blamed me.

1478
01:26:54,522 --> 01:26:56,283
They blamed it on the accident.

1479
01:26:59,235 --> 01:27:01,580
After I'd milked every tear out of it

1480
01:27:02,905 --> 01:27:05,417
I cut my wrists, not deep enough to die,

1481
01:27:05,908 --> 01:27:09,630
but just enough to bleed myself
back into the center of attention.

1482
01:27:11,372 --> 01:27:13,634
So, everybody felt sorry for me again.

1483
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,637
They understood.

1484
01:27:17,837 --> 01:27:21,423
Everybody was talking about me
and my tragedy.

1485
01:27:21,424 --> 01:27:23,060
That's the way I wanted it.

1486
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:26,021
To keep it that way, I lied.

1487
01:27:27,012 --> 01:27:28,899
God, how I lied.

1488
01:27:29,473 --> 01:27:32,236
I even lied about Georgie.

1489
01:27:37,106 --> 01:27:38,951
You were so right, Bernie.

1490
01:27:40,151 --> 01:27:43,831
I'll keep thinking about it.
Not about the accident,

1491
01:27:44,947 --> 01:27:46,876
but how I used it.

1492
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,796
- Get some rest, Frank.
- I'll keep on thinking about it, Bernie.

1493
01:27:52,788 --> 01:27:54,372
You better not take
a chance on me, Bernie.

1494
01:27:54,373 --> 01:27:55,801
You better get rid of me.

1495
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:57,803
Get rid of me, Bernie.

1496
01:28:09,305 --> 01:28:10,858
Bernie, I...

1497
01:28:12,516 --> 01:28:15,018
He's got to get some sleep.
If you want to talk...

1498
01:28:15,019 --> 01:28:16,811
I don't care if he does hear me.

1499
01:28:16,812 --> 01:28:19,783
I just talked to Ray Watson in California.
He's available.

1500
01:28:20,483 --> 01:28:22,567
He can catch the sleeper plane
and be here in the morning.

1501
01:28:22,568 --> 01:28:25,403
- I said I'd call him right back.
- Don't bother. Frank's going to play it.

1502
01:28:25,404 --> 01:28:27,041
Now, wait a minute, Bernie.

1503
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:29,376
I'm not going to let you
protect this guy any longer.

1504
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,326
I'm calling Ray Watson.

1505
01:28:31,327 --> 01:28:33,923
If you do, tell him
to bring a director along with him!

1506
01:29:04,068 --> 01:29:08,154
Maybe not now, Maggie,
but all that valley needs is a few friends

1507
01:29:08,155 --> 01:29:09,708
to treat it kindly for a while.

1508
01:29:10,032 --> 01:29:14,630
To loan it the sharp edge of a plow,
some seeds, and plenty of care.

1509
01:29:15,496 --> 01:29:16,871
It'll pay us back.

1510
01:29:16,872 --> 01:29:18,456
I know it, Joe,

1511
01:29:18,457 --> 01:29:21,345
but it's the others
that are gonna take a lot of convincing.

1512
01:29:40,896 --> 01:29:43,242
- Western Union.
- Yes, come in.

1513
01:29:46,068 --> 01:29:48,069
How's it going
on the other side of the stage, Ralph?

1514
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:49,904
Fine, Mr. Dodd.

1515
01:29:49,905 --> 01:29:54,211
That Mr. Frank's a big man. Big man!
Positive honor to work for him.

1516
01:29:55,286 --> 01:29:57,370
Where have you been, Bernie, out front?

1517
01:29:57,371 --> 01:29:58,882
Yeah.

1518
01:29:59,623 --> 01:30:01,468
Opening night in New York.

1519
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:03,585
The world's most useless man.

1520
01:30:03,586 --> 01:30:04,786
How's Frank?

1521
01:30:05,921 --> 01:30:07,338
Okay.

1522
01:30:07,339 --> 01:30:08,715
How's it been back here?

1523
01:30:08,716 --> 01:30:11,103
He was a little uneasy
with the curtain going up so late.

1524
01:30:13,095 --> 01:30:16,233
If only the first few rows
had the balcony's manners,

1525
01:30:16,974 --> 01:30:18,777
what a wonderful world this would be.

1526
01:30:19,518 --> 01:30:21,572
It was sweet of you
to send all these wires.

1527
01:30:22,605 --> 01:30:24,689
- Who told you?
- I guessed.

1528
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:26,160
How many did you send?

1529
01:30:26,567 --> 01:30:28,412
Nine or ten. You?

1530
01:30:29,153 --> 01:30:30,372
Five or six.

1531
01:30:30,571 --> 01:30:32,041
Where did you get all the names?

1532
01:30:32,364 --> 01:30:33,667
Lambs Club.

1533
01:30:37,703 --> 01:30:38,964
Good. Good.

1534
01:30:40,915 --> 01:30:42,332
Why don't you go out front?

1535
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:45,919
Not me. I don't sit out there
with those nabobs and critics.

1536
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,098
I hear very well right from here.

1537
01:30:48,213 --> 01:30:50,851
That's the advantage
of an onstage dressing room.

1538
01:30:51,133 --> 01:30:52,603
Bernie, keep quiet!

1539
01:30:55,262 --> 01:30:56,899
That's the disadvantage.

1540
01:31:01,602 --> 01:31:03,072
Larry's right, you know?

1541
01:31:04,271 --> 01:31:05,699
From now on, it's his show.

1542
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:07,941
I'm just a visitor.

1543
01:31:07,942 --> 01:31:09,661
Depressed, aren't you?

1544
01:31:09,818 --> 01:31:11,371
Depressed and mean.

1545
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:15,417
It's been a long nine weeks.

1546
01:31:17,201 --> 01:31:19,755
A job is home to a homeless man.

1547
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:23,300
Now, the job is finished.

1548
01:31:27,211 --> 01:31:28,555
Where do I go from here?

1549
01:31:32,633 --> 01:31:33,977
Georgie,

1550
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,856
five weeks ago,
I kissed a woman, a married woman.

1551
01:31:40,766 --> 01:31:42,653
And now I know I love her.

1552
01:31:44,061 --> 01:31:45,489
And I don't know where to turn.

1553
01:31:48,065 --> 01:31:49,899
Lady, close to you like this...

1554
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,370
Bernie.

1555
01:31:53,779 --> 01:31:55,332
I waited.

1556
01:31:56,115 --> 01:31:57,584
Are you going to leave him?

1557
01:31:57,866 --> 01:31:59,117
Bernie.

1558
01:31:59,118 --> 01:32:00,952
In Boston, you told me all you prayed for

1559
01:32:00,953 --> 01:32:03,788
was to see him on his feet again
so that you could get out from under.

1560
01:32:03,789 --> 01:32:06,176
Let me show you something.

1561
01:32:39,241 --> 01:32:44,788
<i>The land around us
Is now in bloom</i>

1562
01:32:45,205 --> 01:32:50,220
<i>With song and laughter
And elbow room</i>

1563
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:56,143
<i>A town has blossomed here
With all serene</i>

1564
01:32:57,426 --> 01:33:02,764
<i>With houses white
And with gardens green</i>

1565
01:33:02,765 --> 01:33:05,683
<i>-The lanes are shady
-The lanes are shady</i>

1566
01:33:05,684 --> 01:33:08,352
<i>-The streets are wide
-The streets are wide</i>

1567
01:33:08,353 --> 01:33:13,827
<i>You and your lady are full of pride</i>

1568
01:33:14,443 --> 01:33:17,528
<i>I can hear children's voices</i>

1569
01:33:17,529 --> 01:33:21,032
<i>I can hear Sunday chimes</i>

1570
01:33:21,033 --> 01:33:25,828
<i>All across the valley better times</i>

1571
01:33:25,829 --> 01:33:27,633
Looks to me like he's made it.

1572
01:33:28,791 --> 01:33:30,784
What about you? Are you leaving him?

1573
01:33:32,753 --> 01:33:35,546
- Don't you think that can wait?
- No. It happens to be on my mind.

1574
01:33:35,547 --> 01:33:37,643
It has been ever since
that morning in Boston.

1575
01:33:38,842 --> 01:33:41,313
Georgie, if I could only
make you understand.

1576
01:33:41,762 --> 01:33:44,900
Not now, Bernie. Not now.

1577
01:33:50,938 --> 01:33:52,282
First-act curtain.

1578
01:33:52,981 --> 01:33:56,536
I've got to make the dressing room tour
and give out with the rah-rah stuff.

1579
01:33:59,238 --> 01:34:00,832
I thought you were out front, Bernie.

1580
01:34:01,156 --> 01:34:03,908
Just came back.
You really hit it tonight, Frank.

1581
01:34:03,909 --> 01:34:05,212
Keep the drive. It's good.

1582
01:34:06,161 --> 01:34:09,007
Okay, Ralph, I can handle this.
Go have yourself a smoke.

1583
01:34:09,248 --> 01:34:10,926
You know something? That's work.

1584
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:14,043
Sounded wonderful back here.
Were you pleased?

1585
01:34:14,044 --> 01:34:17,224
Well, I messed it up in a couple of
spots, but I don't think anybody noticed.

1586
01:34:17,714 --> 01:34:19,507
I think you'd better touch up
the gray a little bit.

1587
01:34:19,508 --> 01:34:22,980
Yeah? Make me look at least
two weeks younger.

1588
01:34:30,602 --> 01:34:31,853
How do you feel?

1589
01:34:31,854 --> 01:34:33,282
Good. Good.

1590
01:34:33,772 --> 01:34:35,398
How they liking it out front?

1591
01:34:35,399 --> 01:34:37,119
I only know what I read in the papers.

1592
01:34:37,818 --> 01:34:39,318
They came in late on you.

1593
01:34:39,319 --> 01:34:40,820
As long as they don't leave early.

1594
01:34:40,821 --> 01:34:42,021
Frank.

1595
01:34:43,115 --> 01:34:46,909
Frank, a lot of things are said
in the heat and the toil of the day.

1596
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:47,994
Sure.

1597
01:34:47,995 --> 01:34:49,620
I hope you'll accept my apologies.

1598
01:34:49,621 --> 01:34:51,925
Yeah, I know how
those things can happen.

1599
01:34:52,374 --> 01:34:55,376
Naturally you include my wife
in your apologies, too.

1600
01:34:55,377 --> 01:34:56,847
Of course, Mrs. Elgin.

1601
01:34:57,337 --> 01:34:59,182
I include you, too, of course.

1602
01:34:59,506 --> 01:35:01,257
Well, then you can start
by taking your hat off.

1603
01:35:01,258 --> 01:35:02,728
You're not at a smoker, Mr. Cook.

1604
01:35:08,599 --> 01:35:10,600
You know something?
This is the first kind word

1605
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:12,268
you've had for either one of us.

1606
01:35:12,269 --> 01:35:13,613
I think I know why.

1607
01:35:14,897 --> 01:35:16,772
You'd like me to sign
a run-of-the-play contract

1608
01:35:16,773 --> 01:35:19,442
before the morning papers come out
so you could get me

1609
01:35:19,443 --> 01:35:21,068
for about half of what I'm worth,
is that right?

1610
01:35:21,069 --> 01:35:22,486
Now, Frank, Frank,

1611
01:35:22,487 --> 01:35:25,448
I'm sorry, but you'll just have to
take my word on a thing like that.

1612
01:35:25,449 --> 01:35:28,951
It's true, true, I have been thinking
of different contractual arrangements,

1613
01:35:28,952 --> 01:35:31,506
but that's not why I came back. No.

1614
01:35:31,747 --> 01:35:33,831
I'm having some people
over for supper after the show

1615
01:35:33,832 --> 01:35:36,500
while we're waiting for the notices,
and I just wanted to invite you.

1616
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:38,013
And you, Mrs. Elgin.

1617
01:35:39,338 --> 01:35:42,225
Well, thanks. I'll...
I'll drop by if I'm not too tired.

1618
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:45,228
Good. Hope to see you.

1619
01:35:45,636 --> 01:35:46,836
Yeah.

1620
01:35:49,848 --> 01:35:51,318
Excuse me, Mrs. Elgin.

1621
01:35:51,767 --> 01:35:53,184
We'll be looking for you.

1622
01:35:53,185 --> 01:35:54,385
Thank you.

1623
01:36:12,537 --> 01:36:14,830
- Congratulations, Frank.
- You're very kind.

1624
01:36:14,831 --> 01:36:16,207
They've got you trapped.

1625
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:18,209
Don't ever learn to play the piano, pal.

1626
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:19,877
Congratulations, Frank.
Great performance.

1627
01:36:19,878 --> 01:36:21,181
Thank you.

1628
01:36:22,714 --> 01:36:24,757
Say, Paul,
have you seen Georgie anywhere?

1629
01:36:24,758 --> 01:36:26,853
Well, she was here
a minute ago, Frank.

1630
01:36:42,317 --> 01:36:43,901
There you are, dear.

1631
01:36:43,902 --> 01:36:45,664
Only lost about half of it en route.

1632
01:36:56,915 --> 01:37:00,418
Well, now that it's all over,
I guess this is as good a time as any to

1633
01:37:00,419 --> 01:37:01,888
say thanks to both of you.

1634
01:37:02,546 --> 01:37:03,713
For what?

1635
01:37:03,714 --> 01:37:08,175
Well, if it hadn't been for you two,
Ray Watson would be here right now

1636
01:37:08,176 --> 01:37:09,677
looking for a spoon for his coffee.

1637
01:37:09,678 --> 01:37:10,897
Pardon me, Frank.

1638
01:37:11,847 --> 01:37:14,985
There are as many reasons
for drinking as there are drinkers.

1639
01:37:15,434 --> 01:37:17,571
But there are only two reasons
why a drinker stops.

1640
01:37:18,729 --> 01:37:23,493
He cites or he decides to quit
all by himself.

1641
01:37:26,028 --> 01:37:27,747
I'm not sure I have.

1642
01:37:28,530 --> 01:37:31,626
I faced a crisis up there in Boston
and I got away with it.

1643
01:37:32,367 --> 01:37:35,213
But just about anybody can face a crisis.

1644
01:37:35,787 --> 01:37:38,467
It's that everyday living that's rough.

1645
01:37:40,417 --> 01:37:42,220
I'm not sure I can lick it,

1646
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:45,640
but I think I got a chance.

1647
01:37:50,093 --> 01:37:51,938
The point is, Georgie, what about us?

1648
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,819
No, no, don't go, Bernie. You're...
You're involved in this.

1649
01:37:58,477 --> 01:38:00,353
You know, there's only
one thing more obvious

1650
01:38:00,354 --> 01:38:02,741
than two people looking
longingly at each other,

1651
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,160
and that's two people avoiding it.

1652
01:38:06,902 --> 01:38:10,373
Frank, I certainly didn't want to bring up
any of this tonight,

1653
01:38:11,365 --> 01:38:13,793
but you did,
so let's have the whole truth.

1654
01:38:14,826 --> 01:38:17,672
I married you for happiness,
yours and mine.

1655
01:38:18,163 --> 01:38:20,675
If necessary,
I'll leave you for the same reason.

1656
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:23,970
And I can't guarantee you
that happiness.

1657
01:38:26,254 --> 01:38:28,183
And the rest of the whole truth is that

1658
01:38:28,673 --> 01:38:31,269
it was as much my fault as it was yours.

1659
01:38:32,427 --> 01:38:35,732
In Boston, Bernie accused me
of wanting you completely dependent,

1660
01:38:36,807 --> 01:38:39,736
that I wanted to control
and manipulate your life.

1661
01:38:40,268 --> 01:38:44,741
I denied it, of course, but I think
there's an element of truth there.

1662
01:38:45,649 --> 01:38:47,953
I don't want
to run that risk again, Frank.

1663
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,998
No, you're right.

1664
01:38:52,531 --> 01:38:55,126
This is something
I've got to work out for myself.

1665
01:38:55,742 --> 01:38:57,587
With you or without you.

1666
01:38:58,328 --> 01:39:01,550
Whether the show is a hit or a flop
is beside the point.

1667
01:39:03,792 --> 01:39:08,014
I've got to find myself
whether it's in one room or in five.

1668
01:39:09,714 --> 01:39:12,018
Well, I don't think there's any point

1669
01:39:12,759 --> 01:39:15,480
in us torturing each other
any longer by delaying this.

1670
01:39:16,638 --> 01:39:19,359
You two talk it over,
and I'll go along home.

1671
01:39:20,559 --> 01:39:23,280
But, Georgie, don't dismiss
what we had together.

1672
01:39:25,063 --> 01:39:26,814
I gave you 10 of the roughest years

1673
01:39:26,815 --> 01:39:29,911
anybody ever spent outside
of a concentration camp.

1674
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:33,415
It could be more of the same.

1675
01:39:42,497 --> 01:39:44,634
That was quite a little speech, wasn't it?

1676
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:47,971
I guess I'm still giving a performance.

1677
01:39:49,546 --> 01:39:51,600
This time there's a slight difference.

1678
01:39:52,757 --> 01:39:55,895
At least I... I know it's a performance.

1679
01:40:15,864 --> 01:40:18,877
I know it's gratifying for a woman
to be wanted and needed.

1680
01:40:19,284 --> 01:40:21,379
But not for every minute of every day.

1681
01:40:22,621 --> 01:40:25,039
Just remember that for years
he's been a leaner.

1682
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,801
You said so yourself.

1683
01:40:52,692 --> 01:40:54,746
Pretty tune, isn't it, Frank?
Remember it?

1684
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:58,124
Yes. Yes, I do.

1685
01:40:59,699 --> 01:41:02,045
I made a record of it once.

1686
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:01,312
Bernie, I...

1687
01:42:03,371 --> 01:42:05,458
I'm always running out of cigarettes.

1688
01:42:05,682 --> 01:42:07,433
You smoke too much.

1689
01:42:07,434 --> 01:42:09,529
And you're impertinent.

1690
01:42:13,356 --> 01:42:14,826
And you're loyal.

1691
01:42:15,191 --> 01:42:16,636
And steadfast.

1692
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,371
And devoted.

1693
01:42:19,779 --> 01:42:21,541
I like that in a woman.

1694
01:42:46,681 --> 01:42:49,058
Larry, have you seen Frank anywhere?

1695
01:42:49,059 --> 01:42:50,737
He just left, Mrs. Elgin.

1696
01:42:53,605 --> 01:42:54,813
Here you are, Mr. Cook.

1697
01:42:54,814 --> 01:42:56,273
- About time!
- How are they?

1698
01:42:56,274 --> 01:42:58,411
I don't know.
I didn't get a chance to read them.

1699
01:43:08,286 --> 01:43:10,387
Here's <i>The Times</i> and <i>Tribune,</i>
Bernie.

1700
01:43:10,388 --> 01:43:11,808
Thanks, Larry.
