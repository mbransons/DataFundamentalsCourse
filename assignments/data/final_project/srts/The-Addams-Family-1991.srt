854
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:12,724
I'm Wednesday's teacher.

855
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,123
Oh, of course.

856
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:17,028
Wednesday's told us
so much about you.

857
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:27,310
Wednesday is
an excellent student,

858
00:50:27,378 --> 00:50:29,814
but, frankly, I'm concerned.

859
00:50:29,883 --> 00:50:32,750
You see, this is
our class bulletin board.

860
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:34,720
This month our theme
is our heroes--

861
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:37,257
people we love and admire.

862
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,262
You see, Susan Ringo
has chosen the president.

863
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,923
Isn't that sweet?

864
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:47,333
And Harmony Feld
has picked Jane Pauley.

865
00:50:47,406 --> 00:50:50,272
Have you spoken to her parents?

866
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:54,381
But Wednesday
brought in this picture--

867
00:50:54,449 --> 00:50:57,384
Calpurnia Addams.

868
00:50:57,452 --> 00:51:00,082
Wednesday's
Great-aunt Calpurnia.

869
00:51:00,156 --> 00:51:03,057
She was burned
as a witch in 1706.

870
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,563
They say she danced naked
in the town square

871
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:09,192
and enslaved a minister.

872
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:10,394
Really?

873
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,733
Oh, yes.

874
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:13,237
But don't worry.

875
00:51:13,306 --> 00:51:15,070
We've told Wednesday

876
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:16,735
college first.

877
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,215
Isn't he adorable?

878
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:23,081
I made this myself.

879
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:24,212
It's charming.

880
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:26,756
What is he, a lizard?

881
00:51:26,824 --> 00:51:27,849
An elf.

882
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:31,023
Look at you.

883
00:51:37,538 --> 00:51:39,234
That's better.

884
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:41,777
You are too precious for words.

885
00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:45,406
Why, I could just eat you alive.

886
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:47,384
Oh, no, Margaret. Too young.

Wednesday, Pugsley.

00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,165
I changed my mind.

899
00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:24,598

It's Mother.

904
00:52:38,854 --> 00:52:40,789
Damn it, where is he?

905
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:44,393
I never should have used him.

Gordon.

Oh, good--Oh! Aah!

Oh, my!

Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Ah-ha ha!

924
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,935
How all occasions
do inform against me

925
00:53:41,003 --> 00:53:42,801
and spur my dull revenge.

926
00:53:42,873 --> 00:53:44,864
Oh, from this time forth,

00:53:44,942 --> 00:53:47,435

or nothing worth.

A hit!

930
00:53:53,788 --> 00:53:56,052
A very palpable hit.

There were sailors, pirates,

and a plane full of tourists
from Miami Beach,

943

all lost in the Triangle.

will you take me there someday?

It's like a dream.

An open grave.

958

It was my first funeral.

959
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:56,839
You were so beautiful.

00:55:56,917 --> 00:55:59,046
Pale and mysterious.

961
