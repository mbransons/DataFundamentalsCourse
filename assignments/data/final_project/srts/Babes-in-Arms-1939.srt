1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,026
- How's Florrie?
- She's okay, Joe.

3
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,890
- Take her to the hospital?
- We didn't have time.

4
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,192
- I want to see her.
- Your public's calling, get back out there.

5
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,809
Thanks, folks.

6
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,077
It's been five years now
since you've said hello to me and Florrie...

7
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,688
...but this time she asks to be excused.

8
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,649
Joe, it's a boy.

9
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,487
Go on.

10
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,826
Well, it looks like I've got a son.

11
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,566
Born in the Palace Theater.

12
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,595
Here's a toast to vaudeville,
the greatest entertainment in the world.

13
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,638
It made me what I am today, a papa.

14
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,337
And it's pretty nice, I tell you.

15
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,978
Having that little home down there
on Long Island...

16
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,114
...where you can take
the wife and kiddies.

17
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,408
Where you can lay off all summer long...

18
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:41,884
...in the country instead of a crowded
boarding house in the roaring '40s...

19
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,616
...where there's nothing but streets
to play in, like I had when I was a kid.

20
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,592
What other business is like that,
I ask you? There ain't none.

21
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:54,324
Vaudeville, boy, you're something.

22
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,997
Listen, you mugs, quiet.

23
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,470
With so many of the best in one bunch,
I'm tempted to warn you.

24
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,371
There's a shadow coming up,
may change things a whole lot.

25
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:09,243
It's getting taller, that shadow,
and wider, very fast.

26
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,744
The motion picture.

27
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,779
Shadow is right, making faces.
Flash in the pan.

28
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,391
Motion pictures change things?
Not until the Hudson catches fire.

29
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,996
- Yeah. He's right.
- Okay, okay, boys, I hope you're right.

30
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,929
Here's to 40 weeks, may it last forever.

31
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,102
I tell you, Joe,
there's no vaudeville anymore.

32
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,702
Now, take the Palace Theater...

33
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,704
...go there any day in the week,
even Monday, what do you see?

34
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,775
A lot of people buying tickets
for a talking picture.

35
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,137
I don't know what to make of it.

36
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,679
Something's gotta be done.

37
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,752
Every vaudeville performer in Seaport
is broke, and owes everybody in town.

38
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,889
I never thought that pictures
would take the place of vaudeville.

39
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,617
- Maybe if you and Mom had a new act.
- New act, new act?

40
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,818
You talk like your brother.

41
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,589
- Where is Mickey?
- He's in town at the music publisher's.

42
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,993
He wrote a song last night.

43
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,226
He'll write another tonight,
like last night and the night before.

44
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,736
Kids have to go through their
song writing age, I remember when you did.

45
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,737
And I wrote some pretty good ones too.

46
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,603
And what did it get me, nothing.

47
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,677
Mickey is wasting his time.

48
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,643
He'd better learn a trade
and forget about show business...

49
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,248
...or he'll wind up like me.

50
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,580
- There must be some theaters left, Dad.
- A lot of empty ones.

51
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,483
But, darling, with a good bill
you could open them.

52
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:09,117
There's a lot of good acts here that would
be tickled to death to have the opportunity.

53
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,526
Say, that's an idea.

54
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,361
A road show with a lot of old-timers.

55
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,369
So a guy's got to do it himself, eh?
Okay.

56
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,030
I'm going over to Brice's
and see what he thinks.

57
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,768
And that 10-percenter said
that vaudeville was dead.

58
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,311
Not with a lot of troupers like us
around here.

59
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,281
- Will you okay this lyric?
- Wait a minute, I want to hear this song.

60
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,487
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

61
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:43,425
<i>We've danced the whole night through</i>
<i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>

62
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,292
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

63
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:52,837
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>
<i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>

64
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:57,271
<i>When the band began to play</i>
<i>The stars were shining bright</i>

65
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:01,004
<i>Now the milkman's on his way</i>
<i>It's too late to say good night</i>

66
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,978
<i>So good morning, good morning</i>

67
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,879
<i>Sunbeams will soon smile through</i>

68
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:10,614
<i>Good morning, my darling, to you</i>

69
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,851
<i>Here we are together</i>
<i>A couple of stayer-uppers</i>

70
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,557
<i>Our day is done at breakfast time</i>
<i>And starts in with our suppers</i>

71
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:25,602
<i>Here we are together</i>
<i>But the best of friends must party</i>

72
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,433
<i>So let me sing this parting song</i>

73
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,771
<i>From the bottom of my hearty</i>

74
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,879
- <i>Good morning</i>
- <i>It's a lovely morning</i>

75
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,242
- <i>Good morning</i>
- <i>What a wonderful day</i>

76
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:41,011
- <i>We've danced the whole night through</i>
- <i>Danced the whole night through</i>

77
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,384
- <i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>
- <i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>

78
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,718
- <i>How do you do, do, do?</i>
- <i>I said good morning</i>

79
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,088
- <i>See, the sun is shining</i>
- <i>A good morning</i>

80
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,593
<i>Hear the birdies sing</i>

81
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,460
- <i>It's great to stay up late</i>
- <i>It's great to stay up late</i>

82
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:58,661
- <i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>
- <i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>

83
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,704
<i>When the band began to play</i>
<i>The stars were shining bright</i>

84
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,607
<i>Now the milkman's on his way</i>
<i>It's too late to say good night</i>

85
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,272
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

86
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,384
<i>Sunbeams will soon smile through</i>

87
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,787
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

88
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,948
Sell it, Ma, sell it.

89
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:27,623
<i>Good morning, my darling, to you</i>

90
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,299
- How was it?
- Where did you swipe that?

91
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,268
Oh, quit your kidding.
Words and music by Michael Z. Moran.

92
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,671
Why, it'll sweep the country. Won't it?

93
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,506
- Nothing very new there, Mickey.
- Oh, what good is new?

94
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,740
It's the same old rose you see every year.

95
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,283
But it's just a little fresher,
but it's the same thing, isn't it?

96
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:52,013
- How many have you brought me, Mickey?
- I brought you five that you didn't publish.

97
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,126
But I ain't mad,
I'm gonna give you another chance, see?

98
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,129
You can't be wrong all the time, nobody is.

99
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:03,963
- How much do you want for it?
- The usual, 1000.

100
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,599
I'll give you 100.

101
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,872
- A hundred.
- A hundred.

102
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,936
- Honest?
- Oh, that's wonderful.

103
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,046
Mickey, he's gonna publish it.

104
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,943
He is.

105
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,078
Oh, he's fainted. Quick, get some water.
He's... Get some water.

106
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,948
Oh, Mickey, please speak to me.

107
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,680
Wake up. Oh, dear.

108
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,018
It was too much for him.
He couldn't believe it.

109
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,320
Good thing I didn't say yes
to the thousand...

110
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,292
- ...or he'd have dropped dead.
- Yeah.

111
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,264
Are you all right, Mickey?
Speak to me, Mickey.

112
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,538
- What happened?
- Mr. Randall's gonna publish your song.

113
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,577
Look, here's your advance check for $ 100.

114
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,744
Gee, Mr. Randall,
you don't know what this means to me.

115
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,650
I'll never forget you.

116
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,724
You know, you can always be my publisher.
I'm telling you that.

117
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,225
You better get him home
before he passes out again.

118
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,988
- Don't have to worry.
- I understand.

119
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,359
I'm not ever gonna get the big head <i>like...</i>

120
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,296
- You can always be my publisher.
- Okay.

121
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,960
Wait a minute, friend, you've got my head.
Didn't hurt, though. Didn't hurt.

122
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,731
- See you later.
- It's all right.

123
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,745
You know, it's just like coming home
from a big battle the winners.

124
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,118
- Yeah, it was a tough fight, Ma, but we won.
- Oh, Mickey, I'm so proud of you.

125
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,692
But think of all the time lost
because my stuff wasn't recognized before.

126
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,455
Oh, well, all geniuses
have trouble getting started.

127
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,656
Sure, that's what makes them geniuses.

128
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,233
Oh, Mickey, aren't they pretty?

129
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,802
Wait a minute, I wanna pick some.

130
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,070
Just think of it, Pat. My first 100 bucks.

131
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:54,008
- And it's only the beginning too.
- Is it really the beginning?

132
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,013
Does it mean
that I'm really on my way in the theater?

133
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,310
- I want success so.
- And you'll have it.

134
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,978
I know you will, Mickey.

135
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,556
Just think when our names
are up in electric lights.

136
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,389
You, the big composer and producer,
and me, the singing star.

137
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,555
Oh, and I'll work hard for you, Mickey,
honest I will.

138
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,531
Yeah, then when we go
on our vacations to Europe...

139
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,160
...you know, like you read in the paper.

140
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,137
- Our folks won't have to worry.
- No.

141
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,773
We can pay the bills then.

142
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:33,851
Pat, sometimes
do you ever feel older than your folks?

143
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,046
Lots. Especially when they talk about
40 weeks on the road.

144
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,920
Yeah, and making a comeback.

145
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,426
Gee, it must be terrible to be a has-been.

146
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,230
Don't talk like that. It scares me.

147
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,528
We gotta work hard
and make a lot of dough for our folks.

148
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,140
That will be fun.
Oh, won't it be fun, Mickey?

149
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,538
Oh, with both of us in there pitching,
it certainly will be.

150
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,736
It's got to be.

151
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,440
Pat, I'd like to buy you a little something
out of this 100 bucks, but I...

152
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,349
oh, we gotta pay our grocery bill too.

153
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,316
Well, I... Just the same
I'd like to show my appreciation some way.

154
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,266
Would you like my pin?

155
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,730
It's your music class pin.

156
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,440
Well, what do you want me to say?

157
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,202
You know what I want you to say.

158
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,544
Well, I won't.

159
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,008
All right then, don't.

160
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,750
Oh, Pat, I do.

161
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,956
You do what?

162
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:51,290
I do, what you want me to say and I won't.

163
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,328
Very much.

164
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,137
- Well, that settles that.
- Yeah.

165
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,972
Gee, you know, it's good for a man
to have responsibilities.

166
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,397
Your act is just as sure fire as it was
when you were knocking them in the aisle.

167
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,070
Say, Dad. Dad, what's going on here?

168
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,402
Mickey, we're going on the road, all of us.

169
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:41,103
- Oh, gee, that's swell, Dad. When do leave?
- Mickey, none of us kids can go.

170
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,612
None of the kids can...
What do you mean, Dad?

171
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,240
Well, you see, son, it's only the acts
that go, no excess baggage.

172
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,649
You call talent excess baggage?

173
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,620
Dad, there's a lot of entertainment
on this side of the room.

174
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,249
You folks are responsible for it.
We're your kids, chips off the old block.

175
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,124
Most of us were born in theaters,
greasepaint in our veins.

176
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,425
You say you don't want us
to go on a stage. No.

177
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,297
You want us to be lawyers and brokers
and your girls to marry rich guys.

178
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,567
- I suppose that's bad being a broker.
- Clark Gable ain't on relief.

179
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,801
- You're too young, all of you.
- Oh, yeah?

180
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,104
I suppose I'm too young
to sell a song I wrote.

181
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,713
Look, 100 bucks in advance.

182
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,473
- What?
- Mickey, you sold your song.

183
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,983
- Yeah, Mom, and it's all yours too.
- Oh, Mickey, I'm so proud of you.

184
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,417
- Thanks.
- Of course, I always knew you had talent.

185
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,353
Well, so do the other kids.
I've seen them do their stuff.

186
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,993
Take our sister for instance.
What a voice, a natural.

187
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,095
Two more years and she'll be in the Met.

188
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,288
Patsy and Don Jr. And Dody
are swell dancers.

189
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,957
- But our acts are routine, they're standard.
- I'll say they're standard.

190
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,333
So standard that when you miss a line
the audience can prompt you.

191
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,734
All right, I'm sorry.

192
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,705
I don't mean to be fresh,
but I've got a new slant on things.

193
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,777
Got my finger on the pulse of the public.

194
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,813
You wanna hear something?
Molly and Patsy come on over here.

195
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,579
Look out. Spread out kids,
give us room to work here, will you?

196
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,220
Get set. We'll show them
whether we got talent or not.

197
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,515
Wait, until you hear,
this will send you solid.

198
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,750
Now, come on, kids, give your all.

199
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,743
<i>To look at us you'd never dream</i>
<i>The two of us were twins</i>

200
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,543
<i>In fact it's quite ridiculously odd</i>

201
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:29,950
<i>But speaking pedagogically</i>
<i>And not too biologically</i>

202
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,957
<i>We're really just like two peas in a pod</i>

203
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:39,393
<i>We both like to swim</i>
<i>And we both like to dance</i>

204
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:45,197
<i>We both could fall in love with Gable</i>
<i>If we had the chance</i>

205
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:50,172
<i>Our tastes are just the same</i>
<i>Except for just one thing</i>

206
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,640
<i>I like opera</i>

207
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,006
<i>I like swing</i>

208
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,310
<i>We both like to eat</i>
<i>But it pains us to discuss</i>

209
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:03,819
<i>The fact we like potatoes</i>
<i>But potatoes don't like us</i>

210
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:08,892
<i>But when we want to sing a song</i>
<i>We're really on a spot</i>

211
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,191
<i>For I sing sweet</i>

212
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,825
<i>And I sing hot</i>

213
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:31,740
<i>You are my lucky star</i>

214
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:51,726
<i>My darling, you're my lucky star</i>

215
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,737
<i>I saw you from afar</i>

216
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,465
<i>Rudolpho</i>

217
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,109
<i>Robert Taylor</i>

218
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:03,476
<i>Minneapolis and St. Paul</i>

219
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,143
<i>You are</i>

220
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,914
<i>My lucky star</i>

221
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:56,566
<i>Once there was a barber</i>
<i>A barber who lived in Spain</i>

222
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:01,666
<i>He was a barbering fool,</i>
<i>A shaving fool, shaving fool from Spain</i>

223
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,777
<i>He was kind of crazy,</i>
<i>He was always singing in the rain</i>

224
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,008
<i>His name was Figaro The barber of Seville</i>

225
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,683
<i>Figaro</i>

226
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,451
<i>Figaro</i>

227
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,756
<i>Figaro was Spanish</i>

228
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,526
<i>Every time there's a bullfight He quits</i>

229
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,033
<i>Shave and a hair cut, six bits</i>

230
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:37,141
<i>Hi de ho Figaro, Hi de ho Figaro</i>
<i>Hi de ho ho de ho fig fig Figaro</i>

231
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:42,440
<i>Hi de ho Figaro, Hi de ho Figaro</i>
<i>Hi de ho ho de ho fig fig Figaro</i>

232
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,345
<i>Figaro</i>

233
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,720
<i>Figaro</i>

234
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:01,198
<i>Figaro</i>

235
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,357
<i>We're gonna break it up tonight</i>

236
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,093
<i>Stand back</i>

237
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,437
<i>Give them room</i>

238
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,973
- <i>You've gotta clown</i>
- <i>Yeah, you gotta clown on old Broadway</i>

239
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:18,840
<i>Broadway rhythm, it's got me</i>
<i>Everybody dance</i>

240
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:26,247
<i>Broadway rhythm, it's got me</i>
<i>Everybody dance</i>

241
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:30,819
<i>Out on the gay white way</i>
<i>And each merry cafe</i>

242
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:35,456
<i>Orchestras play</i>
<i>Taking your breath away with that</i>

243
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:40,333
<i>Broadway rhythm, it's got me Everybody sing</i>

244
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:48,002
<i>Everybody stand right up and dance</i>

245
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,284
- Hey, Pop, how did you like that?
- Oh, it was fine. Grand, son.

246
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:09,730
Great, but you see, for instance,
that number, it just wouldn't fit in.

247
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,995
- Well, for Pete's sake, why?
- Because we're doing a comeback show.

248
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,631
The kind of acts we did on the big time.
They've got value, a selling point.

249
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,175
Oh, I get you, Pop.

250
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,813
I've gotta show you,
just like the rest of the world.

251
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,314
I thought we could help you, but
you don't want us on the stage, do you?

252
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,977
- Just because you're all... Just because...
- Wait a minute, Mickey.

253
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:34,421
All right, I hope you're all a big success.

254
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,452
Mickey's sort of excited, that's all.

255
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,229
- Wait a minute, Mick.
- Don't mind what the folks say, Mickey.

256
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,732
- We're with you.
- Sure we are.

257
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,302
- Everything will be all right.
- Buck up, Mickey.

258
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,701
I shouldn't have shot my mouth off
the way I did.

259
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,341
It's all right, they understand.

260
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,478
I wouldn't wanna hurt Dad
for all the show business in the world.

261
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,772
- Forget it.
- Certainly, our time will come.

262
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,471
- You bet it will.
- Sure, sure.

263
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,015
Listen, you kids,
I think our time has come.

264
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,914
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you.

265
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,545
Might as well face it, our folks
are up against it, and up against it good.

266
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,021
I've been snooping around...

267
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,659
- ...know what I found out?
- What?

268
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,660
There's a frame up to get the actors
and their kids out of it.

269
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,130
Our houses are mortgaged unless payments
are up to date by July 1 st or out we go.

270
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,768
Yeah, I know something else too.

271
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,665
Miss Steele of the Welfare Society...

272
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,602
...is getting a petition to send us
to a state work school.

273
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,332
- Work school?
- Are you kidding?

274
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,602
- Can I go too, Mickey?
- Quiet, will you, Bobs?

275
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,747
She thinks we ought to be learning a trade
instead of the theater.

276
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,212
She's against show business.

277
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,079
Just be her chance,
while our folks are on the road.

278
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,584
We can't go on the road.
No, we're too young.

279
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,417
We're excess baggage.

280
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,520
You willing to stick together
and pull yourselves out?

281
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,025
- You bet.
- I've got an idea.

282
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,791
Our folks think we're babes in arms?
We'll show them whether we are or not.

283
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,992
I'm gonna write a show for us
and put it on right here in Seaport.

284
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,831
The most up to date thing
these hicks here have ever seen.

285
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,634
Opening night, we'll have Max Gordon,
Sam Harris down to give us the once over.

286
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,299
How about it, kids?

287
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:03,312
We'll get every kid in this town on our side
and we'll start now. What do you say?

288
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,848
All right. Come on kids, let's go.

289
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:12,513
<i>They call us babes in arms</i>
<i>But we are babes in armor</i>

290
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:19,287
<i>They laugh at babes in arms</i>
<i>But we'll be laughing far more</i>

291
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,895
<i>On city streets and farms</i>

292
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,060
<i>They'll hear a rising war cry</i>

293
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,366
<i>Youth will arrive</i>
<i>Let them know you're alive</i>

294
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,341
<i>Make it your cry</i>

295
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,640
- <i>They call us babes in arms</i>
- <i>We never dance</i>

296
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:40,376
- <i>They think they must direct us</i>
- <i>Got no chance</i>

297
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,578
- <i>But if we're babes in arms</i>
- <i>To find romance</i>

298
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,849
- <i>We'll make them all respect us</i>
- <i>Why our arms?</i>

299
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,358
- <i>Why have we got our arms?</i>
- <i>And what's our eyes?</i>

300
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,692
- <i>What have we got our sight for?</i>
- <i>Our sight for, fight for.</i>

301
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,766
<i>Play day is done We've a place in the sun</i>

302
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,530
<i>We must fight for</i>

303
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,036
<i>So babes in arms</i>

304
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,640
- <i>To arms</i>
- <i>To arms</i>

305
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,470
<i>To arms, babes in arms</i>

306
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,477
- <i>We don't wanna go to county farms</i>
- <i>No</i>

307
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:12,276
<i>Come on, you babes in arms</i>
<i>Stand up for your rights</i>

308
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,818
<i>We're coming, we're coming</i>

309
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,388
<i>Come on, you sons and daughters</i>
<i>We gotta fight</i>

310
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,755
<i>We're coming, we're coming</i>

311
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,523
<i>George Washington was just a kid</i>
<i>When he chopped down that tree</i>

312
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,861
<i>But if they'd locked him up for that</i>
<i>Where'd this country be?</i>

313
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,589
- <i>We gotta stand</i>
- <i>We gotta stand</i>

314
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,670
- <i>We gotta stand right up</i>
- <i>We gotta stand right up</i>

315
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,364
<i>We got to stand right up</i>
<i>And tell them that we're right</i>

316
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,977
<i>Yeah, we gotta fight. Yeah, we gotta fight</i>

317
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,773
<i>Fight, fight</i>

318
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,310
<i>What do we cheer for?</i>
<i>What are we here for?</i>

319
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,319
<i>Why were we born?</i>

320
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,424
<i>What do we cry for? What do we die for?</i>

321
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,459
<i>Why do we mourn?</i>

322
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:02,897
<i>Life doesn't stop, life doesn't wait</i>
<i>It goes on</i>

323
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:08,734
<i>We've got to step</i>
<i>We've got to skate into the dawn</i>

324
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:14,539
<i>It's a new day</i>

325
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,171
<i>It's a new day, our flag's unfurled</i>
<i>Come on, let's tell it to the world</i>

326
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,319
<i>On city streets and farms</i>

327
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,580
<i>You'll hear a rising war cry</i>

328
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:31,252
<i>Youth will arrive, let them know you're alive</i>
<i>Make it your cry</i>

329
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,262
<i>They call us babes in arms</i>

330
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,765
<i>A tisket, a tasket,</i>
<i>Who wants your yellow basket?</i>

331
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,996
<i>They think they must direct us</i>

332
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,471
<i>Babes in arms are growing up,</i>
<i>Growing up, growing, growing</i>

333
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,578
<i>But if we're babes in arms</i>

334
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,943
<i>Going around the mulberry bush</i>
<i>Who wants to go around the mulberry bush?</i>

335
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,351
<i>We'll make them all respect us</i>

336
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,922
<i>Hooray, hooray, it's Emancipation Day</i>

337
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,457
- <i>Why have we got our arms?</i>
- <i>We got arms so we can fight</i>

338
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,494
<i>What have we got our sight for?</i>

339
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,063
<i>Play day is done</i>

340
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:12,602
<i>We've a place in the sun We must fight for</i>

341
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,434
<i>So babes in arms</i>

342
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,608
<i>To arms</i>

343
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,155
In the beginning,
we will see Patsy singing...

344
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:38,854
...the most recently published song
number "Good Morning," followed <i>by...</i>

345
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:43,756
Where is the other piece of music?

346
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,631
What are you doing, son?

347
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,537
Oh, nothing. Just scribbling.

348
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,146
- Another song?
- A show.

349
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,678
You're so much like me, you're funny.

350
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,751
- I am?
- Exactly.

351
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,856
You know, I used to troupe
with your grandpop, was he stubborn.

352
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,819
I used to try to get him
to put new things in the act.

353
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,461
You know, like you do to me?

354
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,654
- Wouldn't he do it either?
- Not a chance.

355
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,765
- What happened?
- What happened?

356
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:19,597
He was the greatest headliner in vaudeville,
right up to the day that he died.

357
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,766
Yeah, I know what you mean, Pop.

358
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,705
You know, Mickey,
you're like a lot of kids.

359
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:29,313
You think your old man is finished,
washed up.

360
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,383
Why, Dad, listen here.

361
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,018
They don't come any better than you.

362
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,287
Anyway, your mom and me
are leaving in the morning.

363
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:45,029
I'm sorry you can't go along
the way you used to.

364
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,331
I'm going to miss you, a lot.

365
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,363
Yeah.

366
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,305
I know, Dad.

367
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,440
But I'm depending on you to stay here
and take care of things.

368
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:05,776
- I hope things break real big for you, Dad.
- Thanks.

369
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,554
- Is Judge Black in?
- Yes, ma'am.

370
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,719
I wonder what cause
she's agitating for now.

371
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,991
I never saw a woman get so excited
over other people's business.

372
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,431
My duty is concerned
with those poor children.

373
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,298
And something has got to be done about it.

374
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,804
I want my nephew to tell you what he knows.

375
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,305
Go on.

376
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,143
Well, the vaudeville kids
kind of run in a gang.

377
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,143
They seem to be cooking up something.

378
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,909
Next thing you know, we'll have
a series of filling station robberies.

379
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,679
- Who's the ring leader?
- A tough little kid named Moran.

380
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,517
There's no doubt about it, judge,
he's a bad influence around town.

381
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,953
- Do you know him very well?
- No. Just to speak to.

382
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,096
I go to military school upstate.

383
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,300
Just step outside, Jeff.
I want to talk to Judge Black alone.

384
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,976
As you very well know, John,
I'm head of the welfare board here.

385
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,611
And I'm serving notice on you...

386
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,976
...that I'm not gonna let
innocent children be the victims of society.

387
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,949
Their parents have no income. We don't
know if those youngsters eat regularly.

388
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,453
We know they stay away from school
half the time. They're undisciplined.

389
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,820
They haven't a chance of learning
an occupation that'll support them.

390
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,984
I call that criminal.

391
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:28,755
But, Martha, you'd be taking them away
from their homes.

392
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,892
Homes? Those poor little things
haven't any worthy of the name.

393
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:37,167
Martha, my whole life's
been lived in this town.

394
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,311
I saw the actors come in.
They built their homes here.

395
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,446
They built the church, the library.

396
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,412
Why, their taxes even paved the roads.

397
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:50,552
They're sweet lovable people.
Just grownup children.

398
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,019
And we ought to thank God...

399
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,819
...for the pleasure and laughter
they've given us in our drab lives.

400
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,462
Right now they're having hard times.

401
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,162
And you want me to help you
torment these poor folks...

402
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,802
...by taking their children
away from them?

403
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,599
I won't do it, Martha.

404
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,104
- You mean, you won't...?
- And that's final.

405
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,743
You'd sacrifice the children
for the grownups.

406
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,004
All right, John, I accept your challenge.

407
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,774
I'll see this thing through alone.

408
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,021
Our bankroll will only stand two Cokes.

409
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,097
I never drink anything but Cokes anyway.

410
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,257
Two great, big, large,
wonderful, expensive Cokes.

411
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,330
- Here.
- Patty, look, let's pretend.

412
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,766
All right, where are we?

413
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,534
We're in the Stork Club in New York City
and it's after our opening night.

414
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,702
- I'm in tails and a white tie.
- And I have on an ermine coat.

415
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,110
Oh, Mickey,
I've just got to have an ermine coat.

416
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:55,116
Oh, sure, sure.
And the Cokes here, this is champagne.

417
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,217
Oh, aren't you just mad about champagne?

418
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,883
Yeah, but if this was champagne,
I'd rather have the money it costs instead.

419
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,256
Now, don't worry about it.

420
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,024
You thought up that big parade
to advertise the show...

421
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,064
...and anybody that can think that up...

422
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,827
- ...can think up anything.
- Thanks.

423
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,029
Just think when those
New York producers sign us up.

424
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,039
You know, I've been thinking,
maybe we should get us an agent.

425
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:22,168
Sometimes you get worse than I do.
I'm worried about getting the show on.

426
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,976
I never realized how much a piece of
cellophane and a yard of cheesecloth cost.

427
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,276
What have you planned?

428
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,886
Our folks owe the stores a lot of dough,
I'll say:

429
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,512
"If you want to collect that money
you've got to put dough into our show...

430
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,716
...so we can be a success
then pay you back."

431
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,919
I don't understand,
but it sounds wonderful.

432
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,529
I got the ideas out of a paper.

433
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,892
Seems a lot of countries are
borrowing money...

434
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,558
...so why can't an American go in and
borrow money the same as anybody else?

435
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,535
Sometimes I think that being
a great Broadway producer...

436
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,197
...isn't going to be big enough for you,
Mickey.

437
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,307
Here comes trouble.

438
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,916
Do take the darlings, Alexander.
Let them walk around a bit.

439
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,318
In California, we have drive-ins.
You stay in the car.

440
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,619
- Who's the girl with him?
- I think it's... It is. It's Baby Rosalie.

441
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,228
- Remember the kid movie star?
- Oh, yeah.

442
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:16,356
Hello, Patsy. Miss Barton, this is
Miss Essex, the once famous Baby Rosalie.

443
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,195
How do you do?

444
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,495
I remember you very well.

445
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:25,268
Really? Did you see my biggest success,
<i>The Queen's Little Daughter...</i>

446
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,674
...or did you see my smash hit,
<i>The Baby General?</i>

447
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,711
Well, let me see, I...

448
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,442
It all seems so long ago.

449
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,848
Sauerkraut juice, please.

450
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,217
- I watch my weight very carefully.
- Yes.

451
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,227
I hear you're going to produce a show.

452
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,833
Oh, he is. This is Mickey Moran.

453
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:54,028
- How do you do?
- Anything for me in your show?

454
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,832
I'm dying to get back in the harness.

455
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,237
You? In...

456
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,344
Why, I think that would be swell.
And with your name and all...

457
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,810
You don't wanna fool around
with a punk like this.

458
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,577
You be quiet. You wanna come over
to my place for dinner and talk it over?

459
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,720
- Tomorrow night? Oh, I...
- Say, listen.

460
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,584
My aunt's gonna put you in
the state work school where you belong.

461
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,123
Why, you...!

462
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,095
- Please, don't fight over me.
- Stop it. Mickey!

463
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,789
- Don't worry, it's a pleasure.
- Stop it! Stop it!

464
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,400
Oh, my perfumes.

465
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,469
Hey, get out of here.

466
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,141
Get out of here.
Get out of here, all of you. Get out.

467
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,871
Come now, come now, quiet, please.
This is not a picnic.

468
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,210
This is a very serious matter.
Proceed, Mr. Marks.

469
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,012
And when these young roughnecks
finished up...

470
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,882
...my drugstore looked as though
they'd taken an ax to it.

471
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,921
I want you to know that seven bottles...

472
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,252
...of my most expensive perfumes
were busted.

473
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,759
Forgive me if I say I told you so.

474
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:55,126
Martha, my faith in human nature
would be shattered if you didn't.

475
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,699
Why doesn't somebody tell
what he said to my brother?

476
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,097
I'll tell. I was there.

477
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,330
He told Mickey his aunt was
gonna put him in the state work school.

478
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,771
I hope you see
how this proves every point I made.

479
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,172
Even with provocation,
wrecking this man's shop...

480
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,937
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

481
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,809
Young man, I'll trouble you
to step into my private office.

482
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:16,079
There are things I'd like to clear up.
The rest of you will kindly wait here.

483
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,513
- Mickey.
- Well?

484
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,477
Let you in on a little secret.

485
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,047
I don't need those glasses
any more than a rabbit.

486
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:48,708
But in times of stress,
they're the best safety valve I ever had.

487
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,548
Gives me time to think too before acting.

488
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,486
- You ought to find something like that.
- Oh, I got it.

489
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,924
You mean I ought to think first
and then bust-up drugstores afterwards.

490
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,893
Come over here and sit down.

491
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,794
- Quit school, huh?
- Yeah, last fall.

492
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,994
Tried to get a job. Started writing songs,
you know, show numbers.

493
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,401
Where's your father playing now?

494
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,936
Schenectady.

495
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,805
Good booking?

496
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,251
I'm so worried about my family, judge,
I'm sick inside me.

497
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,855
Miss Steele might be right, Mickey.

498
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,728
It's not fair for you youngsters
to be carrying grownup burdens.

499
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,531
I'm wondering if you were my son, if
I wouldn't rather see you in some school...

500
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,333
...getting an education.

501
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:47,876
Yes, I think if I were your parents,
I might sign Miss Steele's petition.

502
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,503
No, no, no, judge, you don't understand.
She don't understand either.

503
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,343
Why, she don't mean no harm to us...

504
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,316
...but we're not her kind of people
or yours either.

505
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,954
We belong in show business.

506
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,114
We gotta start young so we can get
some steel in our backbone.

507
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,351
Well, gee, we're developing it.

508
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,827
You couldn't teach us a trade.
We got one.

509
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,898
And you couldn't do without it.

510
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,294
We're only kids now...

511
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,528
...but someday we're gonna be
the guys that make you laugh and cry.

512
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,768
Think that there's a little stardust left
on life's dirty old pan.

513
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,239
She don't understand.

514
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,437
Why, she'd put butterflies to work
making rubber tires.

515
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:29,553
I'm not saying I hate her, but why can't
people leave other people alone?

516
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,825
Defense sustained. Case dismissed.

517
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,661
I'll give you 30 days probation
to square yourself with Mr. Marks.

518
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,232
Here he is now.

519
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,006
- What happened, Mickey?
- Was it all right?

520
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,302
Oh, everything's swell.

521
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,008
I guess I showed you, twerp.

522
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,704
The judge bought out the whole front row.
Look at that.

523
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,873
Come on, kids,
we got some rehearsing to do.

524
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,144
Isn't that marvelous?

525
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,456
<i>It seems we stood</i>
<i>And talked like this before</i>

526
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,535
<i>We looked at each other</i>
<i>In the same way then</i>

527
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:25,836
<i>But I can't remember where or when</i>

528
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:33,778
<i>The clothes you're wearing</i>
<i>Are the clothes you wore</i>

529
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,944
<i>The smile you are smiling</i>
<i>You were smiling then</i>

530
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:45,392
<i>But I can't remember where or when</i>

531
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:52,292
<i>Some things that happen For the first time</i>

532
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:59,867
<i>Seem to be happening again</i>

533
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:06,948
<i>And so it seems that we have met before</i>

534
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,610
<i>And laughed before</i>

535
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,280
<i>And loved before</i>

536
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:20,954
<i>But who knows where or when</i>

537
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,862
Come on, put some life in that song,
will you?

538
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,103
Patsy, will you hook my collar
in the back for me, please?

539
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,703
So you're going to dinner
with Rosalie tonight?

540
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,507
Don't go getting jealous.
We haven't got time for that.

541
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,650
- She made eyes at you.
- Oh, you're crazy.

542
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,651
I'm not. She's practicing to be a glamour
girl, so she can get back into pictures.

543
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,621
If those two sing that song like that,
the audience will think it's a lullaby.

544
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:54,521
<i>It seems we've stood</i>
<i>And talked like this before</i>

545
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,760
<i>We looked at each other</i>
<i>In the same way then</i>

546
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:05,569
<i>But I can't remember where or when</i>

547
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,808
That's right. With feeling like that.

548
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,447
I figure you have to know
what you're singing about...

549
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,515
...before you can give
the idea to others.

550
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,084
Don and Molly don't know
what they're singing about?

551
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,653
They're just bashful in front of people,
that's all.

552
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,951
Come on, let's go out
and see if we can't needle them up a bit.

553
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:29,028
<i>And so it seems that we have met before</i>

554
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,897
<i>And laughed before</i>

555
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,268
<i>And loved before</i>

556
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:42,902
- <i>But who knows where</i>
- <i>But who knows where</i>

557
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:49,246
- <i>Or when</i>
- <i>Or when</i>

558
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,885
That's what the audience will be doing
if you sing the song like that.

559
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,652
- We were just rehearsing.
- Yeah. Well, that's no excuse.

560
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:00,490
Molly's heard pop say a million times,
do your best always if you wanna improve.

561
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,497
Wait until Dad's suit fits you
before you try to talk like him.

562
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:07,797
The coat fits all right. I can button it up so
nobody can see how loose the pants are.

563
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,873
I wanted my white pants,
but wouldn't they be at the cleaners?

564
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,874
She'll be so busy talking about herself
that she won't notice.

565
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,375
Maybe not, but lay off me.

566
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,913
You gotta get some feeling into this.
This show is all business.

567
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,484
- Get in there and try the number again.
- Do we have to do it in the canoe?

568
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,416
It's cramped in there, you can't move.

569
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,613
All right.
Then come on, do it over here...

570
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,316
...so long as you get some feeling into it.
Spread out.

571
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,428
Kids, get back to your places.
We're gonna try the number again.

572
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,327
- Bring that settee down here, please.
- I wish they would make up their minds.

573
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,730
Spread out.
Give them plenty of room to work.

574
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,737
Start the number back of the settee here
and later on you can come around in front.

575
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,171
For goodness' sake,
put some real feeling into it.

576
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,810
All right, Antonio.
Give them the introduction.

577
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:06,823
<i>It seems we stood</i>

<i>And so it seems that we have met before</i>

591
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,755
<i>And laughed before</i>

592
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:47,921
<i>And loved before</i>

593
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:52,933
- <i>But who knows where</i>
- <i>But who knows where</i>

594
00:42:53,103 --> 00:43:00,100
- <i>Or when</i>
- <i>Or when</i>

595
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,111
Swell. Swell.

596
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,477
That's the way to sing. In a few minutes,
go over the number again...

597
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,346
...so you'll be sure you got it perfect.
Tony, listen.

598
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,681
Go over that interlude again,
that was terrible.

599
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,756
Well, I gotta go, kids.
Good night, everybody. Come on, Pat.

600
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,290
Send them all home at 9 and tell them
to be here at 10 in the morning.

601
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,694
Okay. I hope you have a nice dinner.

602
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,198
Oh, this is all business, Pat.

603
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,394
You look wonderful, Mickey.

604
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:31,234
Thanks, for always saying the right thing.

605
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,171
I can lick wildcats now.

606
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,403
- Good night.
- Good night.

607
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,731
I beg your pardon, sir.
Whom do you wish to see?

608
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,802
Baby... Miss Essex.

609
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,667
- I'm afraid she'll be unable to see you, sir.
- Why not?

610
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:07,641
Miss Essex is expecting
an important theatrical impresario.

611
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,507
Hey, that's me.

612
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,050
Oh, I don't believe I heard the name, sir.

613
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,680
I know you didn't, because I didn't say it.
It's Moran, Michael Z. Moran.

614
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,919
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Won't you... Won't you step in, sir?

615
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,528
Thanks.

616
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,866
Oh, Michael.
I hardly expected you so soon.

617
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,300
So nice to see you again.

618
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:43,071
Yes, nice to see you too.

619
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,805
I know I kept you waiting.

620
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:47,780
No, you haven't kept me waiting.
I mean, that is...

621
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,284
...I have been waiting to see you
ever since I met you in the drugstore.

622
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:54,253
You're just as impetuous
as I thought you were.

623
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,086
I am?

624
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,818
Dinner is served, Miss Rosalie.

625
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,827
Thank you, Bartlett.

626
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,464
Oh, I almost forgot.

627
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,570
You haven't met my darling yet.
This is Kai.

628
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,639
- Cute, isn't he?
- This is Mr. Moran, Kai, baby.

629
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,743
You give him a nice wet kiss.

630
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,744
Oh, I hope he didn't frighten you.

631
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,941
No, no, no. No, he didn't at all.

632
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,382
He's an affectionate little fellow,
isn't he?

633
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,421
Now, you run along and play, Kai, darling.

634
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:30,693
He has temperament,
just like me, daddy says.

635
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:48,272
Gee, the crickets
are pretty thick out tonight, aren't they?

636
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,120
I've never tasted a <i>tastier...</i>

637
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,725
Miss Essex.

638
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:46,192
Oh, don't call me that.
Call me Baby, everybody does.

639
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,498
Well, all right.

640
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,942
What do you do with yourself, Baby?

641
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,604
I study voice, French and dancing.

642
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,010
That's why I didn't
go to Maine with father.

643
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:02,016
You see, I'm preparing for a comeback.

644
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,482
I don't see why I should accept failure.

645
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,422
Why I should let them tell me I'm through.
Do you?

646
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,790
Heck, no. That's why I think my production
would be perfect for you.

647
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,828
Do you think so?

648
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,023
Oh, I was praying you'd say that.

649
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:21,638
Oh, Michael, don't tell me you're going
to give me my chance.

650
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,831
Well, if I had the dough, I would.

651
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,636
How much do you need?

652
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,076
Well, let me...

653
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,909
Let me see.

654
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,643
We're gonna use a barn some actors used
last summer, turn it into an outdoor theater.

655
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,755
I figured if we all pitched in together...

656
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:44,986
That is, for the scenery and the costumes
and everything, it would run us about $287.

657
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,420
Have you got it yet?

658
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,159
No.

659
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,865
Well, you have now.

660
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,999
Move over here where we can talk.

661
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,636
- Oh, it will be exciting.
- Yeah, yeah.

662
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,942
I can hardly wait.

663
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,814
We'll work together wonderfully,
you and I. How about an orchestra?

664
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,086
We can have the Rangerettes in for nothing.

665
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:22,062
Enchanting. It'll be a great show.
Shall we drink to that?

666
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,166
Why, you bet.

667
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:25,757
Good luck.

668
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,468
I hope so.

669
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,768
Cigar, sir?

670
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,938
Oh, do have one. They're daddy's best.

671
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,278
Well, I can't pass up anything like this.

672
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,527
I suggest, sir, it would draw better
if one bites the end off.

673
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,662
How could I make a mistake like that?

674
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:22,021
Don't draw the cigar smoke in,
Mr. Moran.

675
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,956
Blow it out for your own sake.

676
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,999
This is... This is delightful.

677
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,663
When does the show start rehearsing?

678
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,737
Well, as soon as I can get it...

679
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,345
When?

680
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:51,547
Well, I'll phone you.

681
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,623
I'll phone you tomorrow and let you know.

682
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,954
You'll have to excuse me, please.

683
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:01,256
I've got another appointment.

684
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:09,338
Thanks for the dinner.
It was swell while it lasted.

685
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,386
- Hey, Mickey, here's your pants.
- Where have you been?

686
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,920
Go on, get up there in your place,
would you?

687
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:46,297
All right, kids, that's enough.
Take a rest. We'll try the dance later on.

688
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:49,775
In the meantime, we'll take a reprise
of this "Where or When" number.

689
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,540
Pass the parts out.
We'll take the other in a little bit.

690
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,343
- Hey, Mickey.
- What do you want?

691
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,008
Have you told Patsy yet?

692
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,986
No, I've tried to get it out a million times.
I just can't do it.

693
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:03,820
Well, she's on her way in and
Baby Rosalie will be here any minute now.

694
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,561
Well, I guess it's gotta be now.

695
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,789
- Come on, take over, will you, Don?
- Sure.

696
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,400
Oh, Mickey,
I've practiced until I'm nearly hoarse.

697
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:16,437
- Gosh, isn't it wonderful?
- Yes, it sure is, Pat.

698
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,406
But come over here, I...
I wanna talk to you for a minute.

699
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,204
What is it?

700
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,811
- We're in a tough spot, Pat.
- Yeah?

701
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,549
Yes, we've gotta have a lot of dough
to put on this show.

702
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,282
Well, we need an angel, you know, <i>and...</i>

703
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,822
Can you take it?

704
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,259
Dish it out.

705
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,227
Well, we found an angel.

706
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,994
But in order to keep her,
we have to give her the lead in the show.

707
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,467
Sing my songs?

708
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,166
The songs you wrote for me?

709
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,539
Say my lines?

710
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,978
Oh, <i>Mickey...</i>

711
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:03,210
We were gonna do it together.
This was gonna be our first show.

712
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,684
You and me in there pitching,
just like you said.

713
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:09,917
Yes, I know, but what can we do?

714
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,989
I can't bear it.

715
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,263
Oh, don't cry, Pat, because if you do,
then I'm just gonna call the whole thing off.

716
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,235
Because, I mean, this is too much for me.

717
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,605
Who's crying?

718
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,745
Don't be silly.

719
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:36,951
Pat, would you punch me right in the nose
if I asked you to understudy?

720
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,089
Katherine Cornell did it.

721
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,752
I should be proud.

722
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,697
It's gonna be a tough job, kid...

723
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:51,129
...because this Baby Rosalie
is just a bundle of temperament.

724
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:56,095
Will you help me keep her quiet,
and will you stick in there and pitch?

725
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,671
Put her there.

726
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:01,574
Pat, you're...

727
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,576
You're the tops.

728
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,043
Hello, there.

729
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:15,015
Hello, everybody. Hello.

730
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,225
Alexander,
do take the little darlings for a walk.

731
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,779
Thanks.

732
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,434
Just getting the kinks out.

733
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,972
All right. Come on, kids,
let's try the Antony and Cleopatra sketch.

734
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:08,872
And I want the scene set just like we're
gonna have it with props and everything.

735
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,910
A little pepper now.

736
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,573
Stand up, honey, so I can brush you off.

737
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,116
It's so close today.

738
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,186
Yes, it is sultry, isn't it?

739
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,688
- May I get you a glass of water?
- Thank you, my dear.

740
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,156
Isn't she a sweet little girl?

741
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,217
All right...

742
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,896
...bring the window up in position.
Over the divan, please. There, that's fine.

743
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,829
Okay, give me the parts now, will you?

744
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,402
There, that's fine Bobs.
Don, here's your part. Sid?

745
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,038
- Yeah.
- Miss Essex, please.

746
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,071
And I'd like Miss Essex's headdress now.

747
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:40,937
This is the gate here
and the guard keepers right there.

748
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,772
Now, this Cleopatra's throne room.

749
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,039
A very luxurious layout
overlooking the Nile.

750
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:48,582
This is a swell divan covered
with satin cushions and ostrich feathers...

751
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:51,118
- ...jewels and pearls, things like that.
- Glorious.

752
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,086
Don, you entrance from over here
and you see Baby reclining...

753
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,055
Will you recline, please, Miss Essex?
That's fine. Now, look.

754
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,559
This Mark Antony
is a sort of a man about town.

755
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,697
Very... Very suave, see?

756
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,026
You, Baby, you're Cleopatra,
the queen of Egypt.

757
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,294
Very beautiful, lovely and...
And suave, see?

758
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,596
You hardly know him.

759
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,000
He's busted up your army...

760
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,506
...so the only way you can keep
your throne is to have him fall for you.

761
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,941
Listen, Don. You're a...
You're a Clark Gable-type.

762
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:21,311
Very modern, polished, and, well,
full of suaveness. You see what I mean?

763
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,146
- Yeah, you mean we're suave.
- Yeah, that...

764
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,055
Come on, now.
Let's try it once everybody.

765
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,088
From the beginning now, from the curtain.

766
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,523
Ready? Curtain.

767
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:38,492
- Greetings, Mark. What's new?
- Your Majesty.

768
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,229
No, no, no, that's not quite it, Miss Essex.
Look, do you mind if I show you?

769
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,669
Stand over there. Now, watch me.
You're down here.

770
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,004
You're reclining here. You watching?

771
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,942
Now, I want you to get up
and I want you to slink.

772
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,604
Slink, a regal slink.

773
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,773
Sort of bouncing-like, see what I mean?

774
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,350
All right, go ahead, Don.

775
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,077
Your Majesty.

776
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,814
- What's your name?
- Just call me Baby, everybody does.

777
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,584
Just call me Baby, everybody...

778
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,755
No, what I meant was, what was your line?

779
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,262
The only man in the world
who I would go to meet.

780
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,662
You're the only man in the world
I'd go to meet.

781
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,325
See? More... More...

782
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,664
- Suave?
- Yes.

783
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,670
Well, go on. Now, let's try it again.

784
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,604
Come on, right from where we left off.

785
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,973
Here we go.
You're up there, Baby. That's it, fine.

786
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,212
Your Majesty.

787
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,580
I have a feeling
I'm going to find Egypt fascinating.

788
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,715
Terrible. Terrible. Don, terrible.

789
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,290
- I didn't think so.
- It's the way you read the lines.

790
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,188
There's no feeling to it or anything.

791
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,728
Maybe we'd better try it here on the couch.
Don, come and sit beside her.

792
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,696
I want a more virile approach,
like Clark Gable would do it.

793
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,460
Come on, do it once for me, will you?

794
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,696
Your Majesty, I have a feeling
I'm going to find Egypt fascinating.

795
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,637
No, no, that's still not it, Don.
Let me show you, will you?

796
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,039
Just stand up there for a minute. Look.

797
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,843
Now, see here, Cleo.
You've stalled me for the last time.

798
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,041
You can't push Mark Antony around
like that and get away with it.

799
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:06,245
Last month, I took over the south side.
Now, I'm taking over the palace.

800
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,948
And what's more, I'm taking over you, see?

801
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,390
Get your things packed.
We're taking a honeymoon on the Nile.

802
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,122
I've got a barge waiting
with the motor running.

803
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,731
Now, you see?
That's more the way Gable would do it.

804
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,359
- Well, Gable and I work differently.
- Yeah, that's why he works more often.

805
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:25,065
Okay, Sid, it's your cue.
Don, you're over here now.

806
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,976
Cleopatra, who is this man?

807
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,908
- Who's this?
- Well, that's your uncle, Croesus.

808
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,412
But Cleopatra didn't have an uncle.

809
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,880
Well, she has now.

810
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:38,077
- Shall I keep going while I'm hot?
- You're as cold as an ice cube.

811
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,688
Look, I want this uncle
to be a violent character.

812
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:44,384
Like Lionel Barrymore would play it.
I mean, when he comes into this room...

813
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,086
...and finds his niece here
with a strange man, he's...

814
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,525
He's gotta be...

815
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,928
- Suave?
- No, furious.

816
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,091
Look, Sid,
let me show you what I mean, huh?

817
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,033
Now, this is the way Barrymore would do it.
Now, watch, Sid.

818
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,401
Now, see here, Cleo.

819
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:04,172
This isn't by chance
one of your latest admirers, is it?

820
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:07,009
Why, uncle, I don't know what you mean.

821
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:12,450
Don't try to act innocent, my child.
The whole town's talking.

822
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:17,652
Now, see here, sonny, we don't like
strangers hanging around this place.

823
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:22,628
I'll give you just 48 hours to get out.

824
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,497
Pardon me, Don.

825
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,966
When I go, Cleo goes with me.
I love her, you see?

826
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,628
Out of the way, uncle. We're leaving.

827
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,872
Now, look here, Cleo. I'm your uncle.

828
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,605
I love you as if you were my own niece.

829
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:42,774
But this man is marrying you
just for your money.

830
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,113
She's going with me, understand?

831
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,917
Do you love me
because I'm worth $50 million?

832
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,993
Nonsense. I'd love you
if you only had $40 million.

833
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,526
Money isn't everything.

834
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,687
And I love you.

835
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,467
Yes, that's fine, Miss Essex.
That's just right.

836
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,300
Here, Don, you take over from there.

837
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,272
Come on, Clark Antony, finish the scene.

838
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,180
Well, if you insist.

839
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,975
- Is this the sleeper bus for Schenectady?
- Yes, sir.

840
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:44,375
Have you seen a little girl about?
Oh, never mind.

841
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,777
Oh, Pat. Patty.
Look, let me talk to you.

842
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,043
- Will you listen to me, please?
- No, I won't.

843
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,058
Wait a minute, that's
acting like a big baby.

844
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,710
I'm not a baby, Mr. Moran.

845
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,790
- Then why are you going to Schenectady?
- I wanna see my mother.

846
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,358
- Why?
- None of your business.

847
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,018
Wait a minute, Pat.
Listen, I'm doing the best I can.

848
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,130
Oh, you're doing grand for Baby Rosalie.

849
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:06,166
- Whatever I've done, I've had to do.
- Did you have to kiss Baby Rosalie today?

850
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,566
Well, that's my business, honey.
I'm a director.

851
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,763
Then you'd better get to work,
Mr. Ziegfeld.

852
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,908
The Girl Scouts are just clamoring for you.

853
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,136
- Oh, you don't have to talk...
- Here. I suppose you want this too.

854
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,075
Indian giver.

855
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,045
Listen, how can I be an Indian giver...?

856
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:24,152
Oh, Pat, listen.
Won't you let me explain?

857
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:28,788
Hey! Hey, Patsy!
Give me a chance to explain, will you?

858
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,585
Will you let me...?

859
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:14,227
<i>I cried for you</i>

860
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:22,743
<i>Now, it's your turn to cry over me</i>

861
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:31,044
<i>Every road has a turning</i>

862
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:38,918
<i>That's one thing you're learning</i>

863
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:45,629
<i>I cried for you</i>

864
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:52,737
<i>What a fool I used to be</i>

865
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:57,444
<i>But I'll find two eyes</i>

866
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:02,516
<i>Just a little bit bluer</i>

867
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,916
<i>I'll find a heart</i>

868
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:11,254
<i>Just a little bit truer</i>

869
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:18,958
<i>I cried for you</i>

870
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:25,370
<i>Now, it's your turn to cry</i>

871
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:29,068
<i>Over me</i>

872
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,247
I know I'm no glamour girl like Baby...

873
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:38,749
Like her.

874
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,982
But maybe someday, you'll realize that
glamour isn't the only thing in this world.

875
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:47,095
If your show's a flop, you'll find
you can't eat glamour for breakfast.

876
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,793
Anyway,
I might be pretty good-looking myself...

877
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:54,698
...when I grow out
of this ugly duckling stage.

878
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:58,367
And you're no Clark Gable yourself.

879
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,202
But that's all right.

880
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,571
You go your way and I'll go mine.

881
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:06,511
Don't worry about me. I'll recover.

882
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,177
Time is a great healer.

883
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,919
But in the future, if we should meet again
at the opera or at a ball...

884
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,218
...and I'm dazzling in my diamonds
and pearls and ermine wraps...

885
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:20,885
...and surrounded by lords
and dukes and princes...

886
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,928
...you'll probably be sorry.

887
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,034
And you'll probably realize that life is...

888
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:30,328
...just an idiot's delight.

889
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:34,802
And as I speed through the dark night
into the abyss of oblivion...

890
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,537
...I can only say thanks.

891
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,010
Thanks for the memory.

892
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,148
<i>I'll find two eyes</i>

893
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,051
<i>Just a little bit bluer</i>

894
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,650
<i>I'll find a heart</i>

895
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:57,027
<i>Just a little bit truer</i>

896
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,668
<i>I cried for you</i>

897
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:20,083
<i>Now, it's your turn to cry</i>

898
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,256
<i>Over me</i>

899
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,763
- George, everybody in?
- All but Eddie.

900
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:37,565
- He'll be here shortly.
- Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes.

901
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,867
- You're on seconds, folks.
- Okay.

902
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,067
- Who opens the show tonight?
- You fellows do.

903
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,009
We do? What's the idea...?
Hey, Joe, why do we open the bill?

904
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,581
Listen, we've gotta take turns
in opening the show.

905
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,981
- We're all headliners.
- But we got a terrific finish.

906
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,647
- You want to see anyone?
- Yes, I wanna see my mother, Mrs. Barton.

907
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,724
- Okay. Dressing Room Number 4.
- Thank you.

908
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,487
We'll try it that way tonight
and we'll see how it works.

909
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,823
- For the love of Mike, Patsy.
- Hello, Mr. Moran.

910
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,933
- What are you doing here?
- I got kind of lonesome for my mother.

911
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,331
Things got so tough
you had to come up here, huh?

912
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:11,599
- Oh, no. Everything's just fine.
- Lillian, Lillian, I got a surprise for you.

913
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,675
- Look what I found in the hall.
- Why, Patsy.

914
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,903
Why, did the house burn down or something?

915
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,537
Can't a girl come to see her mother
without everybody thinking she's crazy?

916
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:21,944
Hello, Mrs. Moran.

917
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,814
- Hi, Patsy.
- When did you get in here?

918
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,478
Patsy, tell me, what's Mickey doing?

919
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,591
What's Mickey doing?

920
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:34,787
He's got a lot of kids together and he's
gonna put on a show, a wonderful show.

921
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,656
- He's doing what?
- Dear, don't get excited.

922
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,273
- He didn't say anything in his postcard.
- Is Junior in it?

923
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:41,927
- How's Dody?
- How Frankie's dance?

924
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,231
- It's grand.
- What's this baloney about a show?

925
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:47,467
It's the truth.
He wrote it, and now he's gonna produce it.

926
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:51,272
And he's got the Rangerettes
and Baby Rosalie and...

927
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:55,178
oh, he's got a lot of kids.
No kidding. It's gonna be swell.

928
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:57,819
Why did Mickey do this?

929
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,649
Miss Steele said that
we weren't having the proper care...

930
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,485
...and she threatened to send us
to the state work school.

931
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,524
- What state work school?
- An institution?

932
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,630
How do you like that?
Our kids in a work school.

933
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,426
Listen, folks, let's give up
this silly tour and go home.

934
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,596
- I'm going home.
- Right.

935
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:16,431
George, we can't do that
just because the going is tough.

936
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:19,802
- I know business will pick up next week.
- You told us that last week...

937
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,671
I'm gonna put you all out of here...

938
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:25,678
- ...because I wanna talk to Patsy.
- Right you are. Everybody get out of here.

939
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,314
Mickey's show sounds elegant.
Where did he get the money?

940
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,981
- I don't know.
- Isn't Baby Rosalie the movie baby?

941
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,184
- She's the star of the show.
- Wonderful.

942
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,694
Now, dear, tell me, why aren't you in it?

943
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,764
Oh, I thought I wanted a theatrical career,
but I changed my mind.

944
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,334
Why?

945
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,198
Too many heartaches.

946
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:53,968
- Now, what do you know about heartaches?
- <i>Well...</i>

947
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:56,304
You and Mickey quarrel?

948
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,670
You did, didn't you?

949
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:03,173
And you quit the show
and came up here to see me?

950
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,715
You shouldn't have done that, Patsy.

951
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,723
Well, he took all my songs
and gave them to her.

952
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,622
Doesn't matter.

953
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:17,692
- Why not?
- Mickey was doing it for everybody.

954
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:22,427
Patsy, your daddy was a minstrel man.

955
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,334
So was his daddy.

956
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:30,844
They did plenty of crazy things,
but they never walked out on a show.

957
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,977
But, Mother, Mickey and I were...

958
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:41,420
And she kept putting her arms
around him and I just <i>couldn't...</i>

959
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,822
Sid, girls, what are you standing
around for? Hurry up, get ready.

960
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:20,154
Aren't you finished with that?

961
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,301
I may be a sap about the men I pick,
but I'm no quitter.

962
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:31,668
So there. My family are all troupers
and we don't walk out on any show.

963
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:35,004
Who said anything about
walking out on any...?

964
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,509
Oh, women.

965
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,213
See who it is, Millicent.

966
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:45,618
- Is Miss Essex dressed?
- Come in, Michael.

967
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,983
Oh, how's our little star? Fine, I hope.

968
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,125
- A little nervous. Sit down.
- Thanks.

969
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,261
- How's our director?
- I'm a little nervous too, and then some.

970
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,987
That's a sign of a good trouper.

971
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:59,624
Then I must be great. Gee, I wished I hadn't
plastered my name all over everything.

972
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,464
- You'll get used to it. Look at me.
- Well, maybe.

973
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:06,165
Get out of my way or I'll put you
in jail where you belong, the lot of you.

974
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:07,900
My father!

975
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,236
Well, there you are, young lady.

976
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:14,280
- Where's this Michael Z. Moran?
- I'm him.

977
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,853
So you're the smart twerp that was going to
exploit the prestige of an important name.

978
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,921
- Why, for a nickel...
- Wait a minute...

979
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,753
Wait nothing. Here, young lady,
get into this coat. We're getting out of here.

980
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,395
- But she's the star of the show.
- Don't make me laugh.

981
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:30,555
I'm grooming her for a comeback.
Millicent, you pack up. Come on.

982
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:34,032
- But, father, I've got a great part.
- Listen, you can't take her away.

983
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:36,501
- Take her. She's a pain in the neck.
- Come on.

984
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,537
- Listen. Will you listen?
- Father, dear...

985
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,937
- She's got money in the show.
- Kiss that goodbye.

986
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:44,773
I'll tell you when you have
a great part just as I always did.

987
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,177
- What are you gonna do?
- What about the audience?

988
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,510
- Are we gonna give a show?
- What's gonna happen?

989
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,846
Quiet, will you?
I don't know what I'm gonna do?

990
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,886
Give me a chance to think.

991
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,690
Come on with me, Patsy.

992
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,656
Everybody out but Patsy.
The show is going on.

993
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,323
The curtain goes up in seven minutes.
Now, snap into it, will you, kids?

994
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:09,001
Get your makeup on.
I wrote this show for you, see?

995
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,765
Get out there and show them
I wasn't crazy when I did it.

996
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,206
Don't think things have changed
between you and me. Go out and sell it.

997
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,969
- Oh, Mickey, you're...
- Never mind.

998
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,637
I know what I am, an Indian giver.

999
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,378
What's the delay, Mickey?

1000
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,576
I didn't know
you could have so much trouble.

1001
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,085
Would you do me a favor?
Would you make a speech...?

1002
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,383
Mickey, here's your makeup.
You'd better hurry.

1003
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,526
Tell them that Patsy's going on instead.

1004
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:33,218
- What's happened?
- Tell you later.

1005
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,919
Would you do that for me, please?

1006
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:37,190
- All right, Mickey.
- Thanks.

1007

<i>But I will tell you if you want to know</i>

1039
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:55,521
<i>Now, so help me, Moses And upon my life</i>

1040
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:59,189
<i>That was no lady, that was my wife</i>

1041
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:05,864
<i>Hallelujah upon his life</i>
<i>That was no lady, it was his wife</i>

1042
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:11,738
<i>Mr. Tambo</i>
<i>I've a question to ask you tonight</i>

1043
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:15,179
<i>And with all your fancy knowledge</i>
<i>You should know</i>

1044
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:19,081
<i>Mr. Tambo, will you tell us</i>
<i>And give us a treat</i>

1045
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:22,553
<i>Tell us why does a chicken Cross the street</i>

1046
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:30,655
<i>I has studied up my geography</i>
<i>Studied up my history</i>

1047
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:35,793
<i>Studied up my poultry with pride</i>
<i>And I am here to repeat</i>

1048
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:41,466
<i>A chicken crosses the street</i>
<i>Just to get on the other side</i>

1049
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:45,535
<i>Mr. Rooster, don't you hide</i>

1050
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:49,775
<i>The chicken crossed the street</i>
<i>To reach the other side</i>

1051
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:57,217
<i>There's a grand old minstrel man</i>
<i>Whose name we hold so dear</i>

1052
01:14:57,392 --> 01:15:03,888
<i>I know that you'll remember him</i>
<i>The moment that you hear</i>

1053
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:10,730
<i>Ida, sweet as apple cider</i>

1054
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:15,206
<i>Oh, sweeter than all I know</i>

1055
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:18,505
<i>Know, know, know, know, know, know</i>

1056
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:24,209
<i>Come out, oh, won't you come out</i>
<i>In the silvery moonlight</i>

1057
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:30,882
<i>Of love we'll whisper so soft and low</i>

1058
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,388
<i>We were sailing along</i>

1059
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:37,396
- <i>We were sailing along</i>
- <i>On Moonlight Bay</i>

1060
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:39,329
<i>Down the silvery bay</i>

1061
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:42,265
<i>We could hear the voices ringing</i>

1062
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:46,168
<i>They seemed to say</i>

1063
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:51,044
- <i>You have stolen my heart</i>
- <i>A maiden's heart</i>

1064
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:55,411
- <i>Now, don't go away</i>
- <i>Don't you ever go away</i>

1065
01:15:55,584 --> 01:16:00,920
<i>As we sang love's old sweet song</i>
<i>On Moonlight Bay</i>

1066
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,395
<i>I am here to state I am here to relate</i>

1067
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,432
<i>To explain and make it plain</i>

1068
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:16,059
<i>That I'm just wild about Harry</i>

1069
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,674
<i>And Harry's wild about me</i>

1070
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:26,280
<i>The heavenly blisses of his kisses</i>
<i>Fills me with ecstasy</i>

1071
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:29,747
<i>He's sweet just like chocolate candy</i>

1072
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,944
<i>Or like the honey from a bee</i>

1073
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:36,579
<i>Oh, I'm just wild about Harry</i>

1074
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:40,319
<i>And he's just wild about...</i>
<i>Cannot do without</i>

1075
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:44,397
<i>He's just wild about me</i>

1076
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:48,264
<i>I'm just wild about Mandy</i>

1077
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,873
<i>And Mandy's wild about me</i>

1078
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:22,270
<i>I'm just wild about Harry</i>
<i>And Harry's wild about me</i>

1079
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:28,933
<i>The heavenly blisses of his kisses</i>
<i>Fill me with ecstasy</i>

1080
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:32,405
<i>He's sweet just like chocolate candy</i>

1081
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:36,245
<i>And just like honey from the bees</i>

1082
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,584
Wait a minute, folks!

1083
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,366
Don't go. Please stay.

1084
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:57,699
Don't leave. It's only a little shower.

1085
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,251
Well, you'll have to admit,
it took a hurricane to stop me.

1086
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:15,947
Mickey, that was a fine effort.

1087
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:17,989
Where's Dad?

1088
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,865
Mom, where's Dad?

1089
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:27,229
You have to keep pounding on the piano?
Nobody can hear himself think.

1090
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:30,166
- Nobody can think in this house anyways.
- You're so smart...!

1091
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:31,965
Children, please.

1092
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,239
Gee, I'm sorry, Mom.

1093
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,310
Don't worry, he'll be home.

1094
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:40,937
He'll be home? Say, what is this?
You two trying to keep something from me?

1095
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,744
Something happen that I don't know about?
Where's pop?

1096
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:47,821
Mickey, don't shout.
I'm nervous, that's all.

1097
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,321
- I wish your father was home.
- He didn't come home.

1098
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:52,392
He didn't get up and go out before I did.

1099
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,961
- Where is he? What...?
- Mickey, quit picking on Mama.

1100
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:59,692
If you must know, well,
we're afraid Dad's been drinking.

1101
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:02,564
- Dad?
- No, no, it isn't that.

1102
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,502
- I'm quite sure he's looking for work.
- What? For the act?

1103
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:07,801
- No, he's through with show business.
- Through?

1104
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:10,069
That's all he knows.
That's all he's good for.

1105
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:13,646
He's trying to find something steady.
Something we can depend on.

1106
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:17,148
Maybe you could sell Mr. Randall
a couple of your songs to tide us over.

1107
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,685
- I was over there this morning.
- Well?

1108
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:22,688
They got enough songs on the shelf
to drive the country crazy.

1109
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,086
I'll still keep on trying.

1110
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,659
Maybe Dad is right. Maybe he is through.
But I'm not.

1111
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,319
Show business owes us something
and I'm gonna collect.

1112
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,125
Is that so?

1113
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,261
We're through. All of us.

1114
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,235
Starting over.

1115
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:41,341
And if ever I hear show business,
song writing...

1116
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:46,004
...or that word vaudeville mentioned here,
I'll kick the tar out of you.

1117
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,046
You didn't raise me on that kind of talk.

1118
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:51,379
I'll take that rap.
I didn't know any better. I do now.

1119
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:53,987
Come on, take it easy. Take it easy.

1120
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:57,614
The theater is full of promises,
great promises...

1121
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,318
...so long as you hand over
your heart and soul.

1122
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:03,191
Then something new comes along,
you're tossed in the ditch.

1123
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,333
The procession goes on.

1124
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:11,467
Well, I got a job. I start tomorrow.

1125
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,335
Doing what?

1126
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:15,908
- Running an elevator.
- Listen...

1127
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,204
- At least we'll eat.
- Yeah, that counts me out.

1128
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,473
- What do you mean?
- I'm getting out on my own.

1129
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,776
- No, you're not.
- No? You just try and stop me.

1130
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,476
- Mickey.
- Well?

1131
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,451
- Mr. Moran.
- Yes?

1132
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:29,590
I've brought the papers.

1133
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,191
Papers? What papers?

1134
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,192
After you've signed them,
return them to Judge Black's office.

1135
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,660
Have the children there
at 9:00 on Friday morning.

1136
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,163
Hey, what...? What is this?

1137
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:42,030
- Haven't you told them yet?
- I'll take care of this, thank you.

1138
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,762
I'm sorry.

1139
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:46,700
<i>Dad...</i>

1140
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:58,283
Dad, you've... You've turned against us.

1141
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:02,255
- You, you...
- It'll only be for the time being.

1142
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:03,914
You'll get education there.

1143
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:08,153
I can't do it no other way and
I won't let you be a tramp in the streets.

1144
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:12,130
Listen, son, you gotta be something.
You'll thank me someday, I know you will.

1145
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,700
Quit talking like that.
It makes me sick to hear you.

1146
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,098
Go on, sign the papers!

1147
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:19,001
- But that Steele, she'll never get me!
- Shut up.

1148
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,972
All right, Dad.

1149
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,053
Here comes Mickey now.

1150
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,693
- Wait a minute.
- What's happened?

1151
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:41,761
- What's the matter?
- Something the matter?

1152
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,170
- What's up?
- Anything wrong?

1153
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,663
They're gonna sign us
to the state work school.

1154
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,631
- They are?
- Oh, no.

1155
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:50,464
- Did you near that?
- Hey, Mickey, here's a letter for you.

1156
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,130
The mailman just brought it.
It's from Harry Maddox.

1157
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:56,277
- Say, that's the big producer.
- Read it, Mickey.

1158
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:58,742
- Yeah, go on.
- See what it says.

1159
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,043
You read it, Don.

1160
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:10,250
"Dear Mickey. Your friend, Judge Black,
talked me into coming to see your show.

1161
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:13,223
It was the only time I came near
being drowned and liking it.

1162
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,386
Drop in and discuss your
production with me.

1163
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,793
Sincerely yours, Harry Maddox."

1164
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:21,896
Say, anybody got a dime
that I can get to New York with?

1165
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,334
- Here, I got two bits.
- Oh, what a pal.

1166
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,031
- Come on, let's go to the station with him.
- All right.

1167
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,384
Look what it says in the paper
about the show. "Babes In Arms..."

1168
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:40,953
Come on, get back on the stage.
We got a lot of rehearsing to do. Come on.

1169
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:45,058
Hello. Yes, this is the Harry Maddox
Theatrical Productions.

1170
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:49,356
Yes, ma'am. Yes, we're casting children
for the new show.

1171
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:50,759
You're welcome.

1172
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:54,390
Stage mother. Why doesn't Mr. Maddox
produce Ibsen instead of kid shows?

1173
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:56,127
You got me.

1174
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:09,050
Sorry, Mr. Maddox is busy.
You'll have to wait.

1175
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,950
Hello. Yes, Mr. Maddox.

1176
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,020
No, he hasn't come in yet. Yes, sir.

1177
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:18,824
- I beg your pardon.
- Only casting children today.

1178
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:22,122
I'm Joe Moran. Mr. Maddox sent for me.

1179
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:27,132
Mr. Moran. Oh, yes, he's expecting you.
Please come right this way.

1180
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,942
Hello, Joe.

1181
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:39,774
By golly, it's good to see you.

1182
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:41,415
Thanks, Mr. Maddox.

1183
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:44,074
Cut it out. Where did you get that
Mr. Maddox stuff?

1184
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:48,120
- Well, you're a big shot now, Harry.
- Apple sauce.

1185
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:51,622
You know show business, up today
and down tomorrow and back up again.

1186
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:53,693
Sit down, sit down, I wanna talk to you.

1187
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,956
Say, Joe, do you know it's taken me
a month to find you?

1188
01:23:57,132 --> 01:24:01,000
Well, Florrie and me have got
a place down near the job.

1189
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:04,138
- You know, the kids went out on their own.
- Yeah.

1190
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:07,604
Yes, I know. They'll...
They'll do that, kids will.

1191
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:09,709
What I wanted to see you about was this.

1192
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:13,314
- I'm in a spot where you can help me out.
- Oh, no show business.

1193
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:17,417
The world has been changing so rapidly
in the last few years, it's kept us all dizzy.

1194
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:20,315
The public...
The public is like the Frenchman's flea...

1195
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,321
...you put your finger on them
and boom, they aren't there.

1196
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,425
They're always hungry for something new.

1197
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:28,361
I'm not interested in the public.

1198
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:32,432
Didn't talk like that the night Mickey
was born, back in the Palace Theater.

1199
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,092
When everybody in the audience got
to be your brother and your sister.

1200
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:39,001
Gee, they were great that night.
Remember?

1201
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:42,601
- Yeah, they were.
- A lot of that's come back, Joe.

1202
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:45,678
Old-fashioned sentiment's
not taboo anymore.

1203
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:49,715
And, Joe, a song-and-dance man
as great as you are...

1204
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:52,114
...is just as much of a miracle
as he ever was.

1205
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,222
Leave me alone, Harry.
I want no part of it.

1206
01:24:56,524 --> 01:25:00,255
I stood on Broadway corners
and watched the business I grew up in...

1207
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,259
...that I was good in.

1208
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:06,734
I watched it pass me by
like I had no place in it.

1209
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:10,132
Never turned around to see
if your feelings were hurt.

1210
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,996
Kids had nothing.

1211
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:14,971
Home gone.

1212
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:19,970
I got up out of the rosin
as often as I could.

1213
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,512
I'm tired.

1214
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:28,883
- I'll stay where I am.
- <i>You...</i>

1215
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:32,549
Kidding yourself that you can live
without doing what you were put here for.

1216
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:36,629
You mean to say that you think you can
keep away from show business? No.

1217
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:39,392
Joe, I'm offering you a job.

1218
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:43,264
A job where you'll see the people crowding,
sure they're gonna have a good time.

1219
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,463
You get to the theater,
you meet your pals...

1220
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,574
...you get your makeup on.

1221
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,266
You hear the orchestra tuning up.

1222
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:53,437
The stage manager calls, "First act places,
please. Curtain's going up."

1223
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:55,774
Then the curtain goes up.

1224
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,350
Oh, boy, what a thrill.

1225
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,048
No, Joe. You and I,
we can't ever live without it.

1226
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:05,616
We know too much about it.

1227
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:10,826
What's your proposition, Harry?

1228
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:14,491
Well, I've got a show.
A new show. A bunch of kids, see?

1229
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:17,638
As fresh and sparkling as anything
that ever hit Broadway.

1230
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:21,935
But, well, they don't know as much about
song and dance as they think they do...

1231
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,477
...so I want you to teach them.
Show them how.

1232
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:26,875
Yeah?

1233
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:28,605
What do you say?

1234
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:33,946
- All right, Harry.
- I knew you would.

1235
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,750
You run home and tell Florrie
all about it. And listen...

1236
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:40,725
...you and she are having dinner
with me tonight, just like old times.

1237
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:45,298
Joe, by the way, there's somebody
in the show that you know.

1238
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:46,728
Who?

1239
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:49,764
- Mickey.
- Mickey.

1240
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:53,271
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Just keep cool. The kid is swell.

1241
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:58,435
No fooling, he's immense,
but he needs you, Joe.

1242
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,141
He needs you more than anything
in the world.

1243
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:06,720
All right, call your rehearsal.

1244
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:11,518
I'll make a trouper out of him.
A real trouper.

1245
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:14,417
Give my love to Florrie.

1246
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:25,102
Gee, I didn't think you were gonna
be able to make it.

1247
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:27,138
What a man. Thanks, Mr. Maddox.

1248
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:30,607
You see, Mickey, I've loved your father
much longer than you have.

1249
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,245
I'm gonna make good for him too.

1250
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,404
- You'll make good for a lot of people.
- Who?

1251
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:38,450
For the kids who never had a chance.
For the kids a lot of wiseacres are telling...

1252
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,747
...there is no such thing
as an American dream.

1253
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,390
Well, those kids have got
their eyes on you.

1254
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,423
Because you're being given your chance...

1255
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:48,721
...and by the bones of Bacchus,
you'd better make good.

1256
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:53,193
Gee, it's bigger than just a show.

1257
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:56,126
Say, it's everybody in the country.

1258
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:15,919
Look at that kid, will you?

1259
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:20,288
<i>Hi there, neighbor</i>

1260
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:22,156
<i>Going my way?</i>

1261
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:25,731
<i>East or west on the Lincoln Highway</i>

1262
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,960
<i>Hi there, Yankee</i>
<i>Give out with a great big thankee</i>

1264

1265
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:40,139
<i>The mountains bigger And troubles smaller</i>

1266
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:43,307
<i>Hi there, chappy</i>
<i>Look over the seas be happy</i>

1270

<i>Where smiles are broader</i>
<i>And freedom's greater</i>

1271

<i>Where every man is his own dictator</i>

1272
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:05,230
<i>Hi there, Yankee</i>

1277
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:23,386
<i>All of you who think</i>

1278
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:29,292
<i>It's so much easier to give in</i>

1279
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:33,859
<i>Count your many blessings</i>

1280

<i>It's been a lovely day</i>

1314
01:31:56,811 --> 01:32:00,645
<i>I signed a bill declaring war</i>
<i>On bugs in Carolina</i>

1315
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:04,615
<i>I refereed a game of chess</i>
<i>Between Japan and China</i>

1316

<i>Has been a lovely day</i>

<i>I breakfasted in Idaho</i>

<i>I opened up a Turkish bath</i>
