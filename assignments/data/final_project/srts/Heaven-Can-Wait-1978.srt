00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,019
[thunder]

173
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,685
hey, my watch stopped.
look at that.

174
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,987
it keeps flashing
the same time.

175
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,690
i'm dreaming, huh?

176
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,966
well, i...

177
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,101
hey...

178
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,103
this is
an airplane dream.

179
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,706
i forget what they're
supposed to mean.

180
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,809
i think they're a good sign,
aren't they?

181
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,112
mr. pendleton.

182
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,781
mr. pendleton,
you must wait for me.

183
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,916
i'm your escort.

184
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,155
wait for me, please,
mr. pendleton.

185
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,662
the end of the line,
mr. pendleton, please.

186
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,063
hi. how you doing?

187
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,066
hey, you want to
hear a little music?

188
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,068
you have to wait in line.

189
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,671
what? this is
my dream, isn't it?

190
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,339
you mustn't get out
of line. really!

191
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,941
chamberlain,
paul r.

192
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,944
all right. i think
i've brought the, uh...

193
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,379
i've escorted
the final--

194
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,147
asterisk this manifest
as complete.

195
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,382
hi.

196
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,685
you cannot board
before your turn.

197
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,087
i don't need a turn.
i'm not boarding.

198
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,689
i don't think
you understand.

199
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,056
this isn't your
ultimate destination.

200
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,758
this is a way station.

201
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,094
that will take you to your
ultimate destination.

202
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,696
i'm not going.

203
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,699
i'm going to run
around till i wake up.

204
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,101
i'm afraid i haven't
fully explained the basis

205
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,936
on which this system
is organized.

206
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,105
this way station's rules
derived from yours.

207
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,107
they're a product
of your image

208
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,710
and the image of those
who share your image.

209
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,311
violate the rules,
question the principles--

210
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,814
you want to see a trick?

211
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,216
i do this
once in a while

212
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,118
to keep my abductor
pollicis limber.

213
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,720
you want to feel that?

214
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:55,723
that's a perfectly solid
50-cent piece.

215
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,726
i just throw that
into that hand, you see.

216
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,129
i say the magic words,
abracadabra.

217
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,231
and then presto,
it's gone.

218
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:08,168
you probably think
i still have it.

219
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,770
you're wrong,

220
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,305
'cause i can see it
coming out of your ear.

221
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,042
that's
the only trick i know.

222
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,478
mr. pendleton!

223
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,313
gentlemen.

224
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,316
gentlemen,
what's the delay?

225
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,185
sir, we've received
a new arrival

226
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,787
who refuses
to board.

227
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,188
but that's impossible.

228
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,791
have you explained
the rules to him?

229
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:31,792
yes, sir.

230
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,793
quite clearly?

231
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:33,794
yes, sir.

232
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,928
and what
was his rebuttal?

233
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,831
he took a coin
out of my ear.

234
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,099
did he?

235
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,102
perhaps i should
have a word with him.

236
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,971
yes, sir.

237
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,472
mr. pendleton!

238
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,877
he's right
over there, sir.

239
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,911
mr. pendleton!

240
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,380
yeah. hey,
you can call me joe.

241
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,782
how you doing?

242
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,883
mr. pendleton,

243
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,418
you know where
you are, don't you?

244
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,254
i'm in the middle of
a really weird dream.

245
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,923
you see the problem?

246
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,491
joe, come here.

247
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,437
look at me

248
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,907
and listen carefully
to what i'm saying.

249
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,074
yeah?

250
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,210
this is not a dream.

251
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,078
yeah.

252
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,815
life has a certain
quality all its own,

253
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,317
a certain feeling,
and so do dreams.

254
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,054
you know that this
is not life,

255
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,791
and you know now that
this is not a dream.

256
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,193
this is a place
that comes after life

257
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,295
and after dreams.

258
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,297
i'm sure
you're aware of that

259
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,400
and that you'll take
your place with the others.

260
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,041
are you trying
to tell me...

261
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,393
i'm not supposed
to be here.

262
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,128
but you are here.

263
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,064
well, you guys
made a mistake.

264
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,465
this is insupportable.

265
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,333
you're talking
to mr. jordan.

266
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,102
anybody can make a mistake.

267
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,337
mr. jordan, we're
due to take off.

268
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,940
yes, i have
the situation in hand.

269
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,476
joe, if you don't
take your place,

270
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,478
the others can't
complete their journey.

271
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,046
do you think that's fair?

272
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,447
if this
is really heaven,

273
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,049
you're
supposed to be fair.

274
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,118
i didn't
make any mistake.

275
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,520
this is not heaven.
it's a way station.

276
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,122
there is no mistake.

277
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,257
i want a check-out
on joseph pendleton.

278
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,061
when is he due to arrive
at this way station?

279
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,197
sir,
i don't understand.

280
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,866
a check-out? why?

281
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,135
the likelihood of one
individual being right

282
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,403
increases
in direct proportion

283
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,405
to the intensity
with which others

284
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,407
are trying
to prove him wrong.

285
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,541
pendleton,
joseph--

286
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,576
due to arrive
10:17 a.m.

287
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,947
march 20th of
the year 2025.

288
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:11,384
sir, i really
can't believe it. i--

289
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,986
i took him out--i--

290
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,388
i took him out
just before the accident.

291
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,656
you did what?

292
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,658
that car couldn't
have missed him.

293
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,962
you're supposed to wait
for the outcome.

294
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,363
but i was so sure,

295
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,066
and it looked like
it would be painful.

296
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,334
wait. are you saying--

297
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,937
is this your first
assignment as an escort?

298
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,938
yes, sir.

299
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,172
haven't you learned

300
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,174
the rules of probability
and outcome?

301
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,109
every question
of life and death

302
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,078
remains a probability
until the outcome.

303
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,479
so he jumped
the gun.

304
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,581
put me back
where you found me,

305
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,583
and we'll forget
the whole thing.

306
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,387
this man must be put back
into his body at once.

307
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,588
yeah.

308
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,225
thanks, mr. jordan.

309
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:55,262
hey, i'll see you
in about 50 years.

310
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,208
hey, hey, max.

311
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,609
max, i'm back.
i'm back.

312
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,611
he can't hear you,
mr. pendleton.

313
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,213
i hope they got...

314
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,617
the best football team
in america in heaven,

315
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,220
and i hope god
makes you first-string.

316
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,354
aw...

317
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,124
max, i'm going
to get my body back.

318
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,459
where's my body?
where do they keep--

319
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,364
oh, dear.

320
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,100
cremated. i see.

321
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,502
i'm starting against
dallas on sunday.

322
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,971
joe, the body
you occupied on earth

323
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,239
has been cremated.

324
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,640
well, uncremate me,
that's all.

325
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,243
you must be able
to do something right.

326
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,245
does "not being
a good sport"

327
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,247
mean anything
to you?

328
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,250
joe, we can put you
into another man's body,

329
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,719
provided his death
has not yet been discovered.

330
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,154
are you kidding?

331
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,156
put me into
another man's body?

332
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,491
i just got my body
back in shape.

333
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,661
joe, the only way
you can return to life

334
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,231
is in the body
of another man.

335
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,269
i shall have to take charge
of this case personally.

336
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,040
incredibly graceful.

337
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,575
he's about your age
and in perfect condition.

338
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,578
he's too short. he'd never
see over the line.

339
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,547
aah!
aah!

340
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:25,052
you know what kind of
shape you gotta be in

341
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,054
to get to
the super bowl?

342
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,522
yes, joe.
i understand.

343
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,059
[speaking german]

344
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,627
he's not talking
english.

345
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,629
i told you
he was german.

346
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,232
hey, you talk
any english?

347
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,634
we can't be seen
or heard, joe.

348
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,104
well, i don't want
to talk german.

349
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,106
[crash]

350
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,410
i got to be able to call
plays in english.

351
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,679
joe, if you could
not so much lower

352
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,281
but broaden
your standards.

353
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,582
we've seen
many bodies,

354
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,418
and the choices
are becoming limited.

355
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,628
julia, please,
i beg of you.

356
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,363
i want a drink.

357
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,364
there's plenty--

358
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,366
i've got to have
a drink.

359
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,601
no, no, no.

360
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:18,171
mr. farnsworth loathes
cold cucumber soup.

361
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,609
hey, this is some house.
who lives here?

362
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:26,546
leo farnsworth,
a man of enormous power.

363
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,149
we should make the arrangement
later this afternoon.

364
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,684
thank you, sisk.

365
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,687
just leave the door open
as you leave, sisk.

366
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,289
thank you very much.

367
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,691
the more servants
who see us, the better.

368
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,427
joe: this guy?
are you kidding?

369
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,295
jordan:
that's not farnsworth.

370
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,164
give me a drink.
don't drink.

371
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,565
who are they?

372
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,635
farnsworth's wife and
his confidential secretary.

373
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,103
you hate me.

374
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,105
don't be ridiculous.
i love you.

375
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,506
i want a drink!
tony--

376
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,109
it would be better
if you didn't drink.

377
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,112
how long will it be
before they find him?

378
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,513
i don't know,
darling.

379
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,549
it shouldn't be long,
my dearest.

380
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,151
i'm glad we did it.

381
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,418
we couldn't help it.

382
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,819
julia,
it would be better

383
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,256
if you'd try
not to unravel now.

384
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,490
thank you, julia.

385
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,625
is farnsworth
dead yet?

386
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,693
not yet.

387
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,295
what's the matter
with him?

388
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,297
he can't
keep his eyes open.

389
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,699
he's been drugged
by those two downstairs.

390
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,434
this is a murder.

391
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:25,405
you see how he's slowly
sliding into the water?

392
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,773
hey, somebody, get--

393
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,280
hey, hey, get a doctor.
there's a guy--

394
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,547
hey, get a doctor.

395
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,150
you got a guy
drowning in the bathtub.

396
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,552
you left a bare pot
on the carpet.

397
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,554
i can't hold everything
at once.

398
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,156
mrs. farnsworth

399
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,557
would kill you
if she saw that.

400
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,327
hey, somebody!
you got, uh--

401
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,362
give me a drink.
i'd like a drink!

402
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,231
try not to go
overboard, dear.

403
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,900
he was a lecherous,
sadistic son of a bitch.

404
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,503
everyone wanted him dead.
i should be canonized!

405
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,405
perhaps one drink.

406
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,806
woman: where can
the man be?

407
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,274
sisk: i'm sorry,
miss logan.

408
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,410
what harm
can that do him?

409
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,544
julia: we did it,

410
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,813
but that man
deserves to be dead.

411
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:07,947
tony: please.

412
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,716
joe:
they're murderers.

413
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,318
what's going on
out there?

414
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,453
i'm sorry, sir.
it's that miss logan

415
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,854
here to see
mr. farnsworth.

416
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,922
show her in.

417
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,524
yes, sir.

418
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,791
oh, my god.

419
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,261
no. it's
the perfect alibi.

420
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,662
she insists
on seeing him.

421
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,264
let's look for
another body.

422
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,199
a servant
will find the body.

423
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,468
keep sisk with you
at all times

424
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,736
to establish
your whereabouts.

425
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,338
let's get
out of here.

426
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,905
sisk: miss logan, sir.

427
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,909
oh, miss logan.
i'm tony abbott.

428
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,380
this is the library.

429
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,249
that's
mrs. farnsworth.

430
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,516
hello.

431
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,652
i'm going
into the living room.

432
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,520
want to come, sisk?

433
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,489
oh, yes.
certainly, madam.

434
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,392
i'm mr. farnsworth's

435
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,394
personal and private
executive secretary.

436
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,663
i didn't know
whether you knew that.

437
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,931
i'm sorry
he's not down yet.

438
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,401
that's all right.
i'll wait.

439
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,270
would you
take a seat?

440
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,272
no, thank you.

441
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,741
perhaps you'd like to
tell me what it's about.

442
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,012
mr. farnsworth has been sent
hundreds of letters

443
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,582
from a town in england
called pagglesham.

444
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,551
the people who live there--
1,600, including my father--

445
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,554
are about to be forcibly
evicted from their homes

446
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:24,791
to make way for the proposed
exo-grey refinery.

447
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,759
not only will hundreds
of families

448
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,761
be forced to find
other homes,

449
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,365
but the few who remain will
have their health endangered

450
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,368
by the inevitable poisoning
of their air and water,

451
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:38,371
the documented evidence
for which i have here,

452
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,772
along with a petition

453
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:43,410
signed by the 1,673 citizens
of that area.

454
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,446
this is what i'm here

455
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,980
to see mr. farnsworth
about.

456
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,849
you're aware
mr. farnsworth

457
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,351
conducts business
at his office?

458
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,454
i've been to his office.
he refused to see me.

459
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,923
i seriously doubt
he'd see you here.

460
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,659
he'll have to,
because i'm not leaving.

461
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,330
i'm sorry?

462
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,797
i'm not leaving.

463
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,066
i've come 8,000 miles,
mr. abbott,

464
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,602
to do something about
a terrible injustice

465
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,871
that this man leo farnsworth
has perpetrated

466
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,807
on hundreds of innocent,
defenseless people.

467
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,075
somebody ought
to help her.

468
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,010
you can help her, joe.

469
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,679
you can be farnsworth.

470
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,681
if mr. farnsworth
doesn't see me,

471
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,650
i don't know
what i'll do.

472
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,618
tony:
is that a threat?

473
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,086
yes.

474
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,522
i don't want
to be farnsworth.

475
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:30,790
the decision is yours.

476
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,059
miss logan, you
give me no choice.

477
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,794
sisk!

478
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,663
if i had to be
farnsworth,

479
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,064
could we
do it temporary?

480
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,599
yes.

481
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,969
we could arrange that
if you wish it.

482
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,537
sisk!

483
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,506
sisk, please
tell mr. farnsworth

484
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,907
miss logan is here

485
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,376
and refuses
to leave.

486
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,443
yes, sir.

487
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,579
if you really
want to help her,

488
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,581
you'd better hurry.

489
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,583
well, it's only
temporary, right?

490
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,084
that's correct.

491
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,855
only farnsworth
can help her.

492
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,658
once the body's discovered,
it'll be too late.

493
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,136
hey.

494
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,505
that's me.

495
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,608
i haven't changed.

496
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,379
it's just me.

497
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,380
sisk:
mr. farnsworth?

498
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,048
now what do we do?

499
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,150
mr. farnsworth,
are you there, sir?

500
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,152
i'll never get away
with this.

501
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,754
what will we do now?

502
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,589
are you all right?

503
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:37,757
answer him.

504
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,492
people can hear me now?

505
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,627
of course.

506
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,029
but he knows
the other guy's voice.

507
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,465
mr. farnsworth, is everything
all right in there?

508
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:46,799
answer him.

509
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,637
ahem. um, will you
take it easy?

510
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,905
i'll be out
in a minute.

511
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,441
very good, sir.

512
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,909
it works.

513
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,512
of course. inwardly,
you haven't changed.

514
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:00,913
you're still
joe pendleton.

515
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,915
that's what
you and i see.

516
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,517
but outwardly,
you're leo farnsworth,

517
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,554
and that's what
everyone else will see.

518
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,998
miss betty logan
is downstairs, sir.

519
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,468
she insists
upon seeing you.

520
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,470
do you wish
to dress, sir?

521
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,871
oh, uh, sure, sure.

522
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,473
very good, sir.

523
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,875
you mean i'm going to
sound like this guy,

524
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,877
no matter
what i talk like?

525
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,879
i beg your pardon,
mr. farnsworth?

526
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,781
you see?

527
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,616
ha ha ha ha.

528
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,051
heh heh heh heh.

529
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,489
well...

530
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,094
ahh.

531
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,428
whoa.

532
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,769
julia, julia, julia,
please, please, dear.

533
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,771
please, dear,
not now. not now.

534
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,172
i want a sip.

535
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,675
you're sorry you
helped, aren't you?

536
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,645
you wish
he were alive.

537
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,080
why don't you say
it's not true?

538
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,182
you didn't say
it's not true.

539
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:11,784
it's not true.

540
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,185
say it again.

541
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,787
darling, darling,
it's not true.

542
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,789
i don't hate you.
i love you.

543
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,526
there, sir.

544
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,060
thank you. thank you.

545
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,194
ahem.

546
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,967
your helmet, sir.

547
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,968
huh?

548
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,570
your polo helmet, sir.

549
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:33,573
oh, thanks. thanks.
uh, do i play polo?

550
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,107
oh, not really, sir.

551
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,208
sir?

552
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,846
thank you. thank you.

553
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,581
this logan girl
is a godsend.

554
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,182
what's taking so long?

555
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,252
pick up the fountainhead.
pretend you're reading.

556
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,854
lavinia:
right. all right.

557
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,255
corinne:
you go up.

558
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,623
all right.

559
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:59,732
miss logan, sir.

560
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:02,535
hi. how you doing?

561
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:06,673
i'm not leaving until you've
heard what i have to say.

562
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,742
uh, oh, yeah.
well, good.

563
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:12,144
you've been sent
hundreds of letters

564
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,747
from a town in england
called pagglesham.

565
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,148
i know about
that situation.

566
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,884
have you read
the letters?

567
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,051
well...

568
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,653
uh...

569
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:21,788
well, no.

570
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,190
no, you haven't.
i suspected as much.

571
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,192
that's why
i've flown over here.

572
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,795
i and the 1,673 people
whom i represent

573
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,197
and whose names
are on this petition

574
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,633
are not going to
allow their futures

575
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,635
to be determined
by mindless bureaucrats

576
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,036
at the beck and call

577
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,172
of certain so-called
industrialists

578
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,775
for whom elderly men
and women and children

579
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,310
are just figures
to be entered

580
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,779
in your ledgers'
profit and loss column.

581
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:48,014
do i make myself clear?

582
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,315
yeah, but--

583
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:53,252
there are no buts.
you can have me dragged out.

584
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,255
it would be bad publicity
for exo-grey industries.

585
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,257
why don't you just
sit down?

586
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,859
i prefer to stand.

587
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,928
we can stand up.

588
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,329
i've made it my business

589
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:06,065
to find out about
exo-grey industries.

590
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,101
facts that would make
interesting newspaper copy.

591
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,269
ah. well...

592
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,371
your tea,
mr. farnsworth.

593
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,774
oh, right. uh, yeah.

594
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,776
my--my--my tea.

595
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:17,910
uh...

596
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,312
anything else,
mr. farnsworth?

597
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:22,915
uh, no. i think
that's about it.

598
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:24,617
uh, thanks a lot.

599
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,019
thank you. uh,
you want some tea?

600
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:30,990
i want to know what you're
going to do about pagglesham.

601
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,124
pagglesham! pagglesham!

602
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,360
it's what
we're talking about!

603
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:35,962
these people
care very much

604
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,364
that their community
doesn't become destroyed

605
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,000
in the name
of free enterprise.

606
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,402
they care because
they are a community

607
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,872
where hundreds of families
have lived for generations.

608
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,039
i know.

609
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,776
these people are not
going to allow you

610
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,844
to intimidate
and frighten them.

611
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:53,179
i don't
frighten anybody.

612
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,314
aah! aah! aah!

613
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,351
aah! aah! aah!
mmmf!

614
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:00,687
mmmf!

615
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,089
oh, my god!

616
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,027
what in god's name
is that?

617
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,162
well, that--
that was m--

618
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,900
uh, my--
my mrs. farnsworth.

619
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,301
[knock on door]

620
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,303
sorry to disturb you,
mr. farnsworth.

621
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,305
mrs. farnsworth
saw a mouse,

622
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,773
but she's better now.

623
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,408
she just saw a mouse?

624
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,411
no. before. outside.
but she relives it.

625
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:29,015
i'll be in the other room
if you need me, sir.

626
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:30,416
excuse me.

627
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,418
what's the matter
with her?

628
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:36,055
well, listen, uh...
i don't know.

629
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,156
it's really none
of my business.

630
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,025
your wife's none
of your business?

631
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,426
wait. you don't
understand.

632
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,261
i understand one thing.

633
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,931
we will never allow you
to build that refinery.

634
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,198
all right.

635
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,735
i'll build my refinery
in some other place.

636
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,202
very funny.

637
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:53,205
if you think i'm going back
to pagglesham, you're wrong.

638
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,808
i know you're not
afraid of me.

639
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,811
you think a schoolteacher
from a small town

640
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,113
is no challenge for
a world-famous industrialist.

641
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,715
will you please listen?

642
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,116
just be quiet a minute.

643
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,719
just let me say
one thing.

644
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,120
what is it?

645
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,221
sit down.

646
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:13,425
why?

647
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,027
if you'd just sit down,

648
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,429
i think i can explain
something to you

649
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:20,132
that'll clear
this whole thing up.

650
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,910
i'm not really
leo farnsworth.

651
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,011
what?

652
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,512
my name is joe.

653
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,181
very funny,
mr. farnsworth.

654
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,785
i'm sure you enjoy playing
these insulting little games.

655
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:42,354
however, i happen
to know about

656
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,056
your board meeting
on thursday,

657
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,458
which may mean
nothing to you,

658
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:49,896
but if you think
you can treat women

659
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,799
with the same contempt
your company treats the world,

660
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,801
you've got a lot
to learn about

661
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,803
the strength and persistence
of people like myself.

662
00:28:56,836 --> 00:29:00,306
don't think you're going
to get away with this.

663
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:08,114
you got till that board
meeting on thursday

664
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:11,818
to find me a body that
can play quarterback.

i'm going to let you go.

667
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:20,827
i'm going
to let you go now.

668
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,830
listen. there is nothing
to be frightened of.

669
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:26,132
there's plenty
to be worried about,

670
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,835
but there is nothing
to be frightened of.

671
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,837
are you all right?
can i trust you?

672
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,839
yes, dearest?
hmm.

673
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:33,940
hmm.

674
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,010
you locked me
in a closet.

675
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:39,045
only for a moment.

676
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,179
what did you tell him?

677
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,448
you saw a mouse.

678
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:46,452
i'm not good at spur-
of-the-moment alibis.

679
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,187
he's probably
got enough evidence

680
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,189
to lock us away forever.

681
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,323
i don't understand this.

682
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,326
i saw him inhale
the nose spray.

683
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,328
he never
really inhaled it.

684
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:57,930
he overheard us somehow.

685
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:00,933
maybe he's got us
bugged right now.

686

an electronics expert
sweeps the place daily.

687
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,338
he's afraid
of being bugged, too.

688
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:07,940
he's playing with us.

689
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:10,342
he's playing
a game with us,

690
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:11,944
that's what it is.

691
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,612
you locked me
in a closet. why?

692

mr. farnsworth would
like to see you now.

695
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,220
yes, indeed. yes.

696
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,222
would you excuse me,
mrs. farnsworth?

697
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,324
yes, of course,
mr. abbott.

698
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,230
we could take it up
at the board meeting,

699
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,232
but i'm sure it's legal.

700
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,968
can't you do something
legal and be wrong?

701
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:36,969
in what sense?

702

somebody else.

00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,906

you referring to?

was that
the living room?

707
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,246
no. that
was my office.

708

my coordination
is shot, huh?

709
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,249
yes, sir.

710
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,018
just not my day.

711
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:52,919
no, sir.

712
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,257
i wanted to discuss
the haitian arrangement,

713
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,259
the 2 1/2 million acres.

714
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,660
what 2 1/2 million
acres?

715
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,262
the sugar deal.

716
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:04,196
it's no good.

717
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,264
the deal?

718
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,266
no. sugar.
it's bad for the body.

719
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,668
want me to speak
to the haitian ambassador?

720

check on that
pagglesham thing.

721
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,671
see if we're
hurting anybody.

722
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,273
if we're
hurting anybody?

723
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,374
yeah.

724
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,188
is the wicket bugged?

725
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:35,294
we certainly wouldn't
want to hurt anybody.

726
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,695
that's the last thing

727
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,698
exo-grey would ever want
to do, isn't that right?

728
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,301
yeah. we don't want
to hurt anybody.

729

what a stockholder was.

i can't tell whether
he's toying with me

733
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,264
or if he'd precipitate
a crisis in the company.

734
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,665
of course he's toying.

735

think he'll forget
being drugged?

736
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,668
why would he pretend?

737
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,237
for the same reason

738
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,672
he pretended to inhale
the nose spray--to bait us.

739
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,274
he's waiting
for us to crack.

do you actually think
he's playing that saxophone?

there's a tape inside.

they've been playing,

this is the rams' year

scoring 21 points a game.

the rams' record
is the best...

760
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,678
what you're saying
is that, um...

761
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,547
nobody should have
that information,

762
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,316
because if 2 big
companies get together,

763
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,285
they're worth
more money, huh?

yes, sir.

if it's supposed
to be a secret,

how does
the rumor start?

well, sir,
wrong as it seems,

770

they leak it.

771
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,635
but that's
dishonest, isn't it?

yes, it is.

i guess so,
if we got 'em.

816
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,458
the toxic substance
released

817
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:15,461
by the plastic bottles
your company markets

818
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,463
despite the consumer
protection league's lawsuit

819
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,864
forcing you
to delay distribution

820
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,467
until the effects
have been tested.

821
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,469
i've been studying
this thing.

822
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,471
why don't you
come inside

823
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,473
and see what's
going on yourselves?

824
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:28,874
you can't have
outsiders--

825
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:29,875
sure, we can.

826
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,577
come on in,
everybody.

827
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,319
joe: hi.

828
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,936
hi. how you doing,
everybody? i, uh...

829
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,972
these people are reporters
from some of the newspapers.

830
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,141
i thought it would be good

831
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,544
if they saw
how we did things.

832
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,813
leo, this is a very
dangerous precedent.

833
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,483
we have a very full
agenda today already.

834
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,920
i don't see that we
have time for a press--

835
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:18,524
couldn't an accident in your
west coast nuclear plant

836
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:21,393
stimulate seismic activity
in the san andreas fault,

837
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:24,463
which could destroy most
of southern california?

838
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:27,799
i think you'd have
to define "destroy."

839
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,935
excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

840
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,504
i'd like to make
something perfectly clear.

841
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,740
the exo-grey
nuclear facility

842
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:37,743
has a foolproof
built-in safety system

843
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:40,746
that guarantees
no danger of any kind.

844
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,147
that's rubbish.

845
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,749
if there's no danger,

846
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,884
why are
we in a lawsuit?

847
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,720
it's a protest,
not a lawsuit.

848
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,121
that's not the point.

849
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,723
we're doing
something wrong.

850
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,124
everybody's suing us.

851
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,461
we got a lawsuit
from a refinery,

852
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,062
a nuclear lawsuit.

853
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:59,665
a guy named porpoise
is suing us.

854
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:00,866
uh, mr. farnsworth,

855
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,934
that's an ecological suit

856
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,936
brought against
our canning factory

857
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,038
for destroying
porpoises.

858
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,074
ahem. uh...

859
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:13,479
for god's sake,
he knows that.

860
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:14,946
we can porpoises?

861
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,948
our san diego
fleet is...

862
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:18,183
as everybody
here knows,

863
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,851
we can tuna.

864
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,086
in netting the tuna,

865
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,789
we kill a number
of porpoises.

866
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:27,192
since they're mammals of
alleged high intelligence,

867
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,060
there's been
an outcry.

868
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,061
yeah...well...

869
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,062
uh...

870
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,564
yeah.

871
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:33,932
uh...

872
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,133
yeah.

873
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,169
i would just like
to ask you a question.

874
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:41,172
why is he bringing
the press in here?

875
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,774
you know leo farnsworth.

876
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,210
maybe i don't know
leo farnsworth.

877
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,545
exactly.

878
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,146
we have a corporate
responsibility

879
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,148
extending to thousands
of shareholders

880
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,750
of moderate means,

881
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,952
people who are
less well off

882
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,521
than the ecological
groups fighting us.

883
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,623
if we were
a football team,

884
00:40:57,656 --> 00:41:01,026
would you say we had
a winning season so far?

885
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:06,665
leo, i haven't the faintest
idea what you're--

886
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:07,833
just generally.

887
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,068
would you say
we got a winning season?

888
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,238
i would say on balance

889
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,207
we have had
an extremely good year.

890
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,976
we've got a winning season.

891
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,745
what do you do when
you're ahead in the game?

892
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,012
i don't know
what you want.

893
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:24,015
i'll tell you,
you don't make mistakes.

894
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,517
you don't gamble
unnecessarily.

895
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,919
you got
to protect your lead.

896
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:30,055
you don't pass
from your own end zone.

897
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:32,290
you make sure
nobody gets hurt.

898
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,226
you got to use these
guys in the next game.

899
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,928
we won this game.

900
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,764
we got to stay in shape
for the rest of the game.

901
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,799
that's the responsible
thing to do.

902
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,201
it's like when
everybody was supposed

903
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,202
to stop eating grapes.

904
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,571
i didn't

905
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,005
'cause i didn't know
about it.

906
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,575
a lot of guys
will keep eating tuna.

907
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:51,977
but i was thinking,
what if we had

908
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,980
a good-guy tuna company
on the porpoise team?

909
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,582
guys would buy that

910
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,617
so kids wouldn't
get mad at them.

911
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,086
i don't think they're
taking in account...

912
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,153
the expense.

913
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,590
we don't care
how much it costs,

914
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,592
just how much it makes.

915
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,595
if it costs too much,
we charge a penny more.

916
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:12,263
would you pay more
to save fish who thinks?

917
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:15,634
and we handle
all the lawsuits that way.

918
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,168
let other teams
build power plants

919
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,770
in the wrong places.

920
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,973
let the other quarterback
throw a gurgle out

921
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,942
so newspapers
get ahold of it.

922
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:25,977
let's be the team
that makes the rules.

923
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:28,914
let us be the team
that plays fair.

924
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:31,282
let's be
the popular players.

925
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:34,085
we'll have to forget
these nuclear power plants

926
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,087
until we know
they're safe.

927
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:37,856
that refinery
in pagglesham,

928
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,858
we'll have
to relocate it.

929
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,860
it'll cost us $35 million,

930
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,630
but we're going
to come out ahead.

931
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:47,198
whatever that stuff is
we're making, that plastic,

932
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,800
we'll have to stop.

933
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:51,837
we're not in here
for just one game, are we?

934
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,238
we're going all the way.

935
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,240
let's get
to the super bowl!

936
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,009
when we get there,
let's already have won!

937
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,035
hi. how you doing?

938
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:26,037
oh, just fine.
thank you.

939
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:28,106
very well. mm-hmm.
i'm just...

940
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,775
what is happening?

941
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:32,043
tv: ...and give the rams
home field advantage

942
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:34,045
through the playoffs
and the super bowl.

943
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,748
this super bowl
is set for the coliseum.

944
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:39,785
if he weren't going
to be dead soon,

945
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:42,187
he'd need years
of psychiatric help.

946
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,289
let's do it tonight.

947
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,291
tv: the rams will probably
face dallas

948
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,894
in the opening round
of the playoffs.

949
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:50,161
if they win--

950
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:51,262
mr. pendleton.

951
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,731
hey!

952
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:53,832
tv: ...championship
on the 26th.

953
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,133
am i glad
to see you.

954
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,968
line up
any bodies yet?

955
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:59,838
we haven't got
a lot of time--

956
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,408
uh...the, uh...

957
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:06,144
tv: ...and only
4 measly field goals.

958
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:07,278
uh, hi.

959
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,880
i--i'm just...

960
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:10,882
tv: they're home
against cincinnati...

961
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,138
what's up?

962
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,041
we have a number of
interesting probabilities.

963
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,043
i kept my word
to betty logan.

964
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,746
did you find a body
in good shape?

965
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:42,313
i want to see
some bodies.

966
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,749
ahem.

967
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:46,151
joe: somebody with
good legs, good arms.

968
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,153
the super bowl's
coming up.

969
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,156
you must have checked
a lot of bodies--

970
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,059
who is it?

971
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,995
it's sisk, sir.

972
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,396
come in, sisk.

973
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:07,205
sorry to disturb you,
mr. farnsworth,

974
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,174
but miss betty logan
is downstairs

975
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:13,144
and asks if she might have
a moment of your time.

976
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,213
betty l--

977
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:16,214

981
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:25,957

the door closed, sir?

982
00:45:25,991 --> 00:45:28,259
uh...

983
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:29,995

984
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:38,436

you can do.

985
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,006

986
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:52,984

mr. farnsworth,

989
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,389
i don't know what
you must think of me

990
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:01,392
after my behavior
at our first meeting,

991
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,395
but i feel
i must tell you

992
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:07,465
what an extraordinary thing
it is you did today.

993
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,467
you don't
have to say--

994
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,468
no, it's...

995
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,070
because i--i--

996
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,471
you know what? uh...

997
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,473
you look
a little pale.

998
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,475
you want
something to eat?

999
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:18,977
i'll be right back.

1000
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,211
bentley. everett.

1001
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:23,214
miss logan's going to
have dinner with us,

1002
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,216
so put on another plate.

1003
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,819

a liver and whey shake.

1004
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:29,220
where you going?

1005
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:30,822
oh, i thought...

1006
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:33,825
you thought
i meant to go out.

1007
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:35,226
sisk, we're going out.

1008
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,227
come on.

1009
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:37,228
bentley! everett!

1010
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:39,230
we're going out and eat.

1011
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:41,232
which hat
would you prefer?

1012
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:44,235
look, i don't want
to wear a hat.

1013
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,837
i'm sick of hats.

1014
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:48,506
don't show me
any more hats.

1015
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,241
yes, sir.

1016
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:52,077
no more hats.

1017
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:09,294
it's, uh...

1018
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:15,566
do you eat here often?

1019
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,938
are you--nah, look...

1020
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,309
i didn't think
you'd want people

1021
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:27,412
to see you out
with a guy like me.

1022
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,115
i see.

1023
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:32,217
[police siren]

1024
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:49,334
p.a.: pick up 24.
pick up 28.

1025
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,468
i'm sorry.

1026
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:54,439
i just can't
stop staring at you.

1027
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:04,082
i seem to be staring
at you, too.

1028
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,624
even when i was
trying to hate you,

1029
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:16,227
i couldn't help
seeing something else,

1030
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:17,228
something...

1031
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:18,563
what?

1032
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:22,033
in your eyes.
does that sound silly?

1033
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:28,073
when you see
something like that,

1034
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,074
it doesn't matter
what a person looks like

1035
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:30,641
or who they are
or anything.

1036
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:37,715
what is it?

1037
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:42,587
this isn't what i thought
was going to happen to me.

1038
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:49,494
listen, i got to talk
to somebody right away.

1039
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:53,031
would you mind
if i took you home?

1040
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,240
uh...

1041
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,075
i, uh...

1042
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:05,076
good night.

1043
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,245
good--good night.

1044
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,248
oh, hey, by the way,

1045
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,682
i'm getting a divorce.

1046
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:15,120
but you and your wife
aren't even separated.

1047
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:17,688
oh, sure, we are.
it's a big house.

1048
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,290
oh.

1049
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:42,780
hey! how you
doing, bentley?

1050
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,349
fine, sir.

1051
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,186
mr. pendleton?

1052
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,187
oh.

1053
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,388
hi.

1054
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:51,689
uh...

1055
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:59,364
i don't
want that body

1056
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:00,765
we've been
talking about.

1057
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:02,400
something
happened tonight.

1058
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:03,801
this is an outrage.

1059
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,736
we've gone to
enormous difficulties

1060
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,338
to find you an athlete.

1061
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,540
i wanted it,
but that was before.

1062
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,542
something happened
with betty logan.

1063
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:14,145
i changed my mind,
that's all.

1064
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:16,447
i'll get farnsworth's
body into shape.

1065
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:18,283
i'll get corkle
to help me...

1066
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:19,650
back in there, eh?

1067
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:20,651
oh, yes.

1068
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,353
joe: i can do it.

1069
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,522
i know more about getting
into shape than anybody.

1070
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:27,192
so hold up on that body.

1071
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:28,659
hold up on the body?

1072
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:31,329
tell mr. jordan
not to worry about it.

1073
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,331
thank him.
i'm very sorry.

1074
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,233
i want to get into shape
with this body.

1075
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,634
you leave me speechless.

1076
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,137
i have nothing
to say to that.

1077
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,539
i can't even think
how to retort

1078
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:45,210
to something as ridiculous
as turning down a body

1079
00:50:45,243 --> 00:50:46,544
we've gone
to such extremes to find,

1080
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:49,547
and an athlete at that,
in prime condition.

1081
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,116
i don't
know what to say.

1082
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:53,518
what do i do
with his cocoa?

1083
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,520
i don't want
to disturb him,

1084
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,122
but it'll get cold.

1085
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:59,124
i notice
there are 2 cups.

1086
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:02,127
sisk felt since
he was pretending

1087
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,528
to talk to somebody,

1088
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,132
he might want to pretend
to give him cocoa, too.

1089
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:08,533
hey, how you doing, everett?

1090
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,635

1095
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,348
i'm sorry to bother you,

1096
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:25,350
but we don't love
each other,

1097
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:27,152
so let's get divorced.

1098
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:30,621

00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:02,847
uh, sort of. yeah.

1139
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,582
thanks, sisk.

1140
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:05,583
hey.

1141
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,552
max, ha!

1142
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:10,255
hey.
i hear you got

1143
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:12,257
all joe pendleton's
athletic equipment.

1144
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,259
yeah. how'd you
know that?

1145
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,561
i'd like to buy it
from you.

1146
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:19,264
i'd like to
bring it in here.

1147
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:20,665
no, i'm sorry,
mr. farnsworth.

1148
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,832
that's not for sale.

1149
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:22,833
no?

1150
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,435
what do you want it for?

1151
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:27,438
i'd like you
to help me train.

1152
00:53:27,472 --> 00:53:28,473
oh, train?

1153
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:30,708
yeah. as soon as
i'm ready...

1154
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:36,847
i want you to get me
a tryout with the rams.

1155
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,850
i don't understand.
what are you trying out for?

1156
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,851
quarterback.

1157
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,253
quarterback.

1158
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:49,294
yeah, well, the point is,
mr. farnsworth,

1159
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,996
we already got a quarterback
working with the team.

1160
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:55,300
we got a couple
of pretty good backups.

1161
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,302
you call hodges
good, huh?

1162
00:53:57,335 --> 00:54:01,739
the point is we don't
need a quarterback.

1163
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:04,709
look, why don't you try
one of the other teams?

1164
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,876
the oakland raiders
are pretty close to l.a.

1165
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,778
give them a call
and see what they say.

1166
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,780
i want to
get in shape

1167
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,782
in time
for the super bowl.

1168
00:54:11,816 --> 00:54:14,018
what would it cost
to try out?

1169
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:18,923
look, mr. farnsworth,
no team wants a crazy trainer,

1170
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:22,026
and only a crazy trainer
would arrange a tryout for you.

1171
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:25,029
you keep your money,
i'll keep my job,

1172
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:27,932
and we'll keep this little
misunderstanding to ourselves.

1173
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,935
hey, listen--
that's all right.

1174
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,537
i'll finish that up.

1175
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,540
what would you say
if i told you

1176
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:37,942
i was a professional
football player?

1177
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:41,646
boy, hey, these--
these are nice.

1178
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:42,647
max...

1179
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,915
you know
how people die?

1180
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:48,586
yeah. why?

1181
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,456
and after they die,
they go to heaven?

1182
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,858
i guess,
if--if they're good.

1183
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,593
i mean, why not?

1184
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:59,864
you know how it
works in heaven?

1185
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,366
not exactly.

1186
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:02,467
it's probability
and outcome.

1187
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,001
probability
and outcome.

1188
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,603
probability
and outcome.

1189
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,971
i never knew that.

1190
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:08,573
let's say there's
a probability

1191
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:10,441
that some guy's
going to die.

1192
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:12,109
what happens is
an escort

1193
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,978
from his way station
gets a signal.

1194
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,481
he goes down and waits
for the outcome.

1195
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:19,350
if the guy lives,
he wasted a trip.

1196
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:21,886
if he dies,
he picks him up

1197
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:24,489
and takes him back
to his way station.

1198
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,492
he puts him in line for
his final destination.

1199
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:28,693
mind if i smoke?

1200
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:29,760
go ahead.

1201
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:31,762
let's say there's
a new escort.

1202
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:33,364
he gets a signal.

1203
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:35,366
he takes off
and sees a guy

1204
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,368
riding a bicycle
into a tunnel.

1205
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:39,370
the car's coming
the other way.

1206
00:55:39,404 --> 00:55:41,506
he's supposed to wait
for the outcome,

1207
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:44,909
but he's new and figures
the guy's a goner.

1208
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,912
he figures, why should i
have the car hit him?

1209
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:50,915
why not take him out
a few seconds early

1210
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,918
and take him
up to his way station?

1211
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:56,687
listen, i, uh...
need a match.

1212
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:58,689
that clock,
that's a lighter.

1213
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:00,691
so the thing is,

1214
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:02,693
the guy he takes up
to the way station

1215
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:04,695
isn't just
some ordinary guy.

1216
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:07,097
he's an athlete with
fantastic reflexes.

1217
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:11,101
he wouldn't have hit
the car at all, see?

1218
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:13,103
how do you
light this?

1219
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,706
the guy
wasn't really dead.

1220
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,108
his number
wasn't up for years.

1221
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:20,110
he would have
missed the car.

1222
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:22,913
look at the time.
is this lighter right?

1223
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:25,916
they're supposed to put
him back in his body,

1224
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,518
but they can't 'cause
he's been cremated.

1225
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:30,521
they have to find
another body for him.

1226
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:33,524
now, look, mr. farnsworth,
i'm just a trainer.

1227
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:36,827
what you need is
like a really good doctor.

1228
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:38,963
don't you understand
what i'm trying to say?

1229
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,566
sure. that's
a hell of a story.

1230
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,967
max, you--
mr. jordan.

1231
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,536
i'm so glad
to see you.

1232
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,538
i'm trying to
get farnsworth

1233
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:49,540
into shape for
the super bowl.

1234
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,542
i want corkle
to help me.

1235
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:53,944
somebody with us?
who are you talking to?

1236
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:56,947
mr. jordan. he runs
the way station.

1237
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:59,550
you can't see him.
you're still alive.

1238
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:01,952
you probably got
a lot to talk about.

1239
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,954
i'll be on my way.

1240
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:05,556
wait a second, max.

1241
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,958
tell him
who you are, joe.

1242
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,827
he's never going to
believe me.

1243
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,962
he's the only
person i know

1244
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:14,965
who can get me
a tryout with the rams.

1245
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:16,967
you can make him
believe you.

1246
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:19,970
max! i'm not farnsworth.
i'm joe pendleton.

1247
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:22,239
farnsworth's wife and
secretary murdered him.

1248
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,543
this is just a body
they found for me.

1249
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:27,745
they drugged him,
stuck him in a bathtub,

1250
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,079
then i stepped in.

1251
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:33,951
it's not bad material.
i can get it into shape.

1252
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,119
max, please.

1253
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:38,122
look, i really
want to get out of here.

1254
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,591
i won't tell
a word to anybody.

1255
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,993
i promise. it'll be
our little secret.

1256
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:45,996
like what you said
about your sister

1257
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,998
and the coca-cola
salesman?

1258
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:50,000
what about
that scar you got

1259
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:52,603
on the bottom
of your tongue?

1260
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:55,606
what did you do at
your uncle's wedding?

1261
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,608
what about
the first time

1262
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:59,977
i fixed your neck
in pittsburgh?

1263
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,147
[crack]

1264
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,282
now do you
believe me, max?

1265
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,284
please say
you believe me.

1266
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,887
they don't have
a football team in heaven,

1267
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,289
so god couldn't
make me first-string.

1268
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,891
he doesn't believe me,
mr. jordan.

1269
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:15,893
try a little
music, joe.

1270
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,595
that's a great
persuader.

1271
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,711
joe, you never could
play that thing.

1272
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,180
joe.

1273
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,184
you all right, max?

1274
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:42,653
max...
you all right?

1275
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:47,958
sisk!

1276
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:48,959
everett!

1277
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,194
bentley!

1278
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,663
whip up a liver and whey
shake right away!

1279
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,802
i'm gonna play quarterback
in the super bowl.

1280
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:00,204
and nothing can change that,
right, mr. jordan?

1281
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,807
if that's what you've
got coming to you.

1282
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,108
he's still here?

1283
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,275
right there.

1284
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:06,877
max, listen to me.

1285
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:08,746
farnsworth isn't
in bad shape.

1286
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:10,748
i still know
the moves.

1287
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,817
just help me
with the body.

1288
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,085
thanks, mr. jordan.

1289
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,358
sisk! how about that
liver and whey shake?

1290
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,960
hurry up. hurry up.

1291
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:24,962
i need it
for mr. corkle.

1292
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,363
yes, sir.
right away.

1293
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,966
i want the whole staff
to suit up.

1294
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:30,668
we're going
into training.

1295
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:40,244
uh, listen,
mr., uh...jordan, is it?

1296
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:41,679
huh?

1297
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,716

1298
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:49,119
uh, anytime
you want to chime in...

1299
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,988
why, just feel free.

1300
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:54,659
feel free. i'm telling you
to feel free.

1301
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:57,662
you got to help me
talk joe out of this.

1302
00:59:57,695 --> 01:00:00,665
if i do get him a tryout,

1303
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:04,669
that team will put him
out of commission like that.

1304
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:07,404
christ, i can't even
snap my fingers anymore.

1305
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,406
oh, sorry.

1306
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,375
he's not there, max.

1307
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,279
don't get crazy on me.
i'm counting on you.

[blows whistle]

1309
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,655
this just
isn't going to work.

1310
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:06,797
these are the l.a. rams
we're fooling with.

1311
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:15,172
it--it's just--
well, all right.

1312
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,986
i'm still figuring out
what i'll say. i...

1313
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,187
[blows whistle]

1314
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:51,008
you're playing football
with a bunch of butlers.

1315
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,410
we're in the super bowl.
this won't work.

1316
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:56,013
don't worry.
i fixed all that.

1317
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,014
how?

1318
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,715
i bought the rams.

1319
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,788
leo farnsworth has
bought this team,

1320
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:06,190
and he wants
to play quarterback.

1321
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,191
shit!

1322
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,793
crazy son of a bitch.

1323
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,427
we won't take
this bullshit, coach.

1324
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,396
wait a minute.
listen, fellas.

1325
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:14,398
this is the way it is.

1326
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:17,001
he'll play quarterback
in wednesday's scrimmage.

1327
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:19,503
at which time, he and
the coach will decide

1328
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:22,506
whether he's qualified
for the job or not.

1329
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:25,976
mr. farnsworth says,
"tell no one to hold back."

1330
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,477
these were his words.

1331
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:30,380
"let's play that scrimmage
like the super bowl."

1332
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,982
take him at his word.

1333
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:33,350
let's kill him.

1334
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,054
my team.

1335
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,290
that son of a bitch
got my team.

1336
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:43,293
what kind of pressure
did he use, milt?

1337
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:46,997
well, i asked for
67 million, and...

1338
01:02:47,031 --> 01:02:48,933
he said, "ok."

1339
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:51,936
ruthless bastard.

1340
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,917
well, very, very nice.

1341
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:08,418

don't let any
of mr. farnsworth's

1346

racial statements
offend you,

for god's sakes.

to you.

good luck,
mr. farnsworth.

1352
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:05,042
all right, don't worry
about the plays.

1353
01:04:05,075 --> 01:04:07,444
i think i got them down
last night.

1354

look, harry,
he's an eccentric.

01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,461
we've always known that
about farnsworth.

1400
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:07,064
buying a football
team for 67 million

1401
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:09,466
that has
a book value of 19?

1402
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:12,069
3 weeks ago,
the stock sold at 56.

1403
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:14,538
this morning
it opened at 14.

1404
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:20,077
you want a rest,
mr. farnsworth?

1405
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,545
no, no, it's ok.

1406
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:24,548
mr. leo farnsworth intends
to take the los angeles rams

1407
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:28,085
to the super bowl this season
as their quarterback.

1408
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,487
no sign of aberration
in his behavior?

1409
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,090
nothing in his personal
life bothering him?

1410
01:06:33,123 --> 01:06:35,492
i think this statement
speaks for itself.

1411
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:36,693
all right,

1412
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:39,329
i'm going to save you guys
some trouble.

1413
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:40,730
want me to quit?

1414
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:42,666
give me the ball once.

1415
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:45,169

i'll quit.

what you doing?

1428

he's looking
awful good.

boy,
you pulled it off.

1439
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:18,895
you really
pulled it off.

yeah? i don't know.
i think i can do it.

hey, mr. farnsworth,
play any college ball?

01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,738
no. i played
a little polo.

look, look, look.

1444

he brought the whole
goddamn team home.

1445
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,520
that's not
a football team.

1446
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:46,156
there are older men
and skinny younger men.

1447

look at the women.

1448
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,159
that's
the ecology group

1449
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:51,161
that exo-grey
is funding.

1450
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:54,164
he's getting ready to
spring some kind of a trap.

1451
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:56,533
this whole thing--
the football team gag,

the ecology crap,

what did you talk about?

1640
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:01,057

is good, isn't it?"

what was your relationship
with your husband?

1664
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:22,205
very, very close.
very, very special.

he was getting a divorce

1666
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:29,178
and that he asked her
to marry him.

1667
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:30,546
i don't doubt that.

1668
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:33,549
my husband loved me
very, very much,

1669
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:35,284
but he was a man.

1670
01:22:35,318 --> 01:22:39,288
he would say or do anything
to make a conquest,

1671
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:41,290
but, lieutenant, it never
touched our marriage.

1672
01:22:41,324 --> 01:22:43,426
that's what made it
so special.

to pin it on betty.

miss logan, i am sorry

1675
01:22:47,363 --> 01:22:49,698
if i've said anything
that's hurt you.

1676
01:22:49,732 --> 01:22:53,736
i don't know you well
enough for you to hurt me.

1677
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:56,305
i hope you don't
doubt my word.

1678
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:59,108
i don't. i'm absolutely
sure that you're lying.

1679
01:22:59,142 --> 01:23:01,110
i assume
if mr. farnsworth

1680
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:03,512
told you anything
about disliking his hats,

1681
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:05,114
you'd let us know.

1682
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:07,550
you want to know
about his hats?

1683
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,152
he didn't care,

1684
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:11,554
but he wouldn't
wear socks with a suit!

1685
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:13,556
every time
he crossed his legs,

1686
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:16,092
you could see
his ankles were bare!

1687
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:19,062
and he thought hats
looked funny without socks!

1688
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:22,198
but he never told you
he disliked them.

1689
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:23,199

1690
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:24,400

are you asking?

down he goes!

1706
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:04,573
what you're telling me,
mr. abbott,

1707
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:07,576
is that mr. farnsworth
never carried any money

1708
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,213
or credit cards, right?

1709
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:12,181
and no identification
papers, right?

1710
01:24:12,215 --> 01:24:13,582
right, sir. yes.

1711
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:15,584

1714
01:24:21,757 --> 01:24:26,729
we can see the ram players
are concerned

1715
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:29,165
and they're calling
for the stretcher.

1716

jarrett has not moved.

1717
