1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,859
Repent, oh, ye sinners!

3
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:21,022
Oh, ye children of darkness...

4
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,098
behold...

5
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:25,565
the New Moses.

6
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,803
Fight down the demon rum!

7
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,102
Brother...

8
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,406
I was once a sinner like you.

9
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,743
I was a hog.

10
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,976
I was a slave of the demon rum.

11
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:45,111
A child of hell!

12
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:48,349
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,791
But I was saved by this ribbon.

14
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:56,127
It raised me from a hog to a man.

15
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,860
It can do the same for you.

16
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:02,494
Raise your right hand and
take the pledge.

17
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:07,304
Brother, what do I see in
your hand?

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,305
Don't be a hog!

19
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:15,407
Cast the enemy away!

20
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:20,478
Bury demon rum in the waters of
the mighty Mississippi!

21
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,185
Fling it away, I say!

22
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,324
I swear that henceforth...

23
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:33,196
liquor shall never touch my lips.

24
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:36,397
-Me too.
-Bless you, brother.

25
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:37,803
Bless you.

26
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:41,039
Look at that. You see that? See
that picture on there?

27
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,577
Yeah, that's Pocahontas, the
wonderful little...

28
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:44,044
Indian woman.

29
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,911
You know, you all know the
story of Pocahontas.

30
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:50,577
You know? That saved John
Smith's life, you know?

31
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,587
Well, John Smith wanted to get
this remedy from...

32
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,646
Pocahontas, you know?

33
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,521
Course, it's just made out of pure
roots and herbs...

34
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:59,595
that she picked up on the hillside.

35
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:02,290
But she wouldn't give him this
remedy. He couldn't get it.

36
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,334
He had to marry her to get it.

37
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,699
Oh, yes, he did. He had to marry
her to get the remedy.

38
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:11,137
And that's how it got into
the Smith family.

39
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:14,005
And that's been handed down from
generation to generation...

40
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,078
from Smith to Smith right
on down...

41
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,579
and that's how it come clear
down to me.

42
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,479
-My great-grandmother was a Smith.
-Mine too, Doc!

43
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,220
I doubt it. Say, lookee here.

44
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:29,814
Lookee here, my friend. You don't
look good. Now, you are ill.

45
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:31,894
You are sick, and you
don't know it.

46
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,553
Well, l-I do feel kind
of bad, Doc.

47
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:34,520
I knew it.

48
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,598
I could just look at you- Would
you mind stepping up here?

49
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,701
Just get up here on the platform,
will ya?

50
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:41,030
Now, you folks know that this man
is no confederate of mine.

51
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,104
I never saw him before.

52
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,604
Now, along in the spring, just
about the time...

53
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,665
you should go to plowin'...

54
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,075
why, you feel kind of tired,
don't you?

55
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:51,339
You're right, Doc.

56
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,779
And you know that I'm right,
don't you?

57
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,612
You know what that is? That's
spring sickness,...

58
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:56,674
that's what it is.

59
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,617
It's spring sickness, and the only
thing that'll cure...

60
00:03:58,688 --> 00:03:59,655
that is Pocahontas.

61
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,554
Pocahontas. You know, the main
thing about Pocahontas is...

62
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,627
that you can't do a tap of work...

63
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:07,525
you're not allowed to turn a hand
until the whole bottle is empty.

64
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,462
You mean, I can't even sharpen the
ax for the old woman to cut wood?

65
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,569
Why, you can't even hitch up
the mules for her.

66
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:15,831
I'll take a bottle, Doc.

67
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,566
It’s 50 cents a bottle. l-I haven't
got change for...

68
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,471
that dollar here.

69
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,975
You don't mind just takin' another
bottle, do you?

70
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,672
Because, you know, you're gonna
be tired during the summer...

71
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,772
and that'll carry you over
till I get back.

72
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:29,477
Now, who else wants a bottle?

73
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:32,179
You don't have to work.

74
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:34,347
You can lay off anytime.
I've got a few.

75
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:37,153
Complete relaxation while you're
taking it. Here you are.

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,457
Who'll have another bottle here?

77
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:43,656
Hey, Doc, let me have one
of them two bits.

78
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:48,601
I’m awful sorry, lady. I haven't
got any more of...

79
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,138
the 10-cent ones.

80
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,208
They're all 25 cents, ma'am.
I didn't have enough.

81
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:57,412
There you are.
Who'll have another?

82
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:01,245
-Morning, Captain Eli.
-Hello, Doc.

83
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,376
Make yourself at home.

84
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,456
Say, what in thunder are you doin'?

85
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,860
I’m just teaching you how to
salute my boat.

86
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:18,627
The Claremore Queen. Look at
her layin' over there.

87
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:21,202
Yeah.

88
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:24,431
Give her two more toots.

89
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:30,007
Say, that's four.

90
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,479
-That's a-That's a double salute.
-No.

91
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,915
Just honoring the unburied dead,
that's all.

92
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:39,386
Yeah, don't-don't try to poke
any fun at that.

93
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:41,548
Duke and I just bought it.

94
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:43,852
We saved up every nickel we
got to get that boat.

95
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,326
Duke?
That's your nephew, ain't it?

96
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,987
You bet your life. And he's a
great boy, Duke.

97
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:51,225
I thought he was pilot on the
Memphis Girl.

98
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,392
Well, he was. He's the main
pilot on there.

99
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,003
But not no more. He's making
his last trip...

100
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:58,131
and then he's comin' right on
there with me.

101
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,175
You stick to doctoring.

102
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,972
You ain't no steamboat man.
Cramp her, Mink.

103
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,080
Cramp her. I’ll take her, Mink.

104
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,045
Well, admittin' Duke's a
pretty good boy...

105
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,553
what could you do on a steamboat?

106
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,955
Well, I’m just gonna sit up in the
pilot's house...

107
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:19,984
and toot the whistle and listen
to that old river sing.

108
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,097
The way you brag, I suppose...

109
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,199
you're fixin' to stick that old
apple crate yonder...

110
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,268
in the big race to Baton Rouge
this summer.

111
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:30,395
I never had thought of that.
But that's an idea at that.

112
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:33,805
You know, the Claremore Queen
won that race in '84.

113
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:36,503
And with... And with Duke
as a pilot...

114
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:39,308
I’ll bet she could win it again.

115
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,316
I suppose you'd like to bet your
boat against my boat...

116
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,819
on the result of that race, huh?

117
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,755
Well, l-I don't know.

118
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:52,350
Well, I’ll bet you at that.
I’ll bet you.

119
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:55,124
You made yourself a bet and lost
yourself a steamboat.

120
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:07,467
Come up and get it. Come on.

121
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:11,569
Good-bye, folks. Good-bye.

122
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:18,747
Ain't you gonna stay ashore here
with us, brother?

123
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,085
The devil's pretty active
around these parts.

124
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,524
Nay, brother. The Lord's a-callin'
me up the river.

125
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,927
Gotta wrestle with the captain of
the Memphis Girl.

126
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,124
He's backslid.

127
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,794
Well, durn my britches! The
Memphis Girl, huh?

128
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,395
Say, I’ve got a nephew works
on that boat.

129
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:39,600
You need anybody to help you
wrestle with the devil,...

130
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:41,233
he'll help you.

131
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,369
He's the best wrestler in this
whole country.

132
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,504
His name's Duke. Duke's
his name.

133
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,708
Yes, sir. He's pilot of the boat.

134
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:51,480
Thank you, brother. I’ll fetch
him the word.

135
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:55,622
You tell him to hurry on down
here. I ain't...

136
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:58,285
any man to be kept waitin'.

137
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,466
Good-bye, brother. Keep the faith.

138
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,003
You can count on me, Moses.

139
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,335
I ain't got no more use for liquor.

140
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,931
Hey, Doc!

141
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:35,059
That's two bottles you got.
Cost you a dollar.

142
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:38,224
I ain't got any money, Doc, but
I can work it out.

143
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,461
-'Work it out.' What can you do?
-Steamboat engineer.

144
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,562
Yeah? Steamboat engineer?

145
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:46,107
Are you an engineer? Huh?

146
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:49,610
Say, boy, you just drunk yourself
into a job. Come on in here.

147
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:03,416
Well, engineer, what do
you think of it?

148
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:04,550
Kind of looks as though a lot
of rats have to...

149
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,687
find themselves a new hole.

150
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,264
Well, of course it don't look
so good right now.

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,559
But you got to remember that...
Well, a steamboat...

152
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,364
is a female, you know?

153
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:15,561
And when they're struttin' up and
down the river where...

154
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,265
everybody's lookin' at 'em...

155
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,603
they're just like a woman with a
new Easter bonnet on.

156
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,701
But when nobody ain't lookin'
at 'em, why...

157
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,110
they get kind of careless and
don't care.

158
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,978
-Yeah-sloppy.
-Sloppy. That's right.

159
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:31,814
But with a-with a good, live man
on this boat like you are...

160
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:35,789
say, you can make this thing
perk up and strut.

161
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,120
Get some paint on her nose and get
these chickens out of here.

162
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:40,218
We can put them right in
the pot now.

163
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,422
Here. Here. Start flirtin'
with that.

164
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:44,623
But, Doc, you told me yourself
that a...

165
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,565
man couldn't do a lick of work
when he's on Pocahontas.

166
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,400
Oh, that's the first bottle.
But after that...

167
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,997
you've got to work to get the
best results out of it.

168
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,202
Now, hurry up. Duke's gonna be
here any day now...

169
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,711
and he'll be here.

170
00:09:57,813 --> 00:10:01,715
Ooh! Look at that.

171
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,251
It says 'Captain.' It says
'Captain' on it.

172
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,652
Ain't that great? Oh, uh-Oh,
no. No, no.

173
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:09,657
Now, listen. We'll find a sign
painter up the...

174
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:10,860
river somewhere...

175
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,657
and I’ll-we'll have 'Chief
Engineer'...

176
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,355
put on there, see?

177
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:16,761
And if I have any room, you know...

178
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,630
and you work good, we'll put
'First Mate.'

179
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:25,036
Come on, now. Let's get
goin'. Hurry up.

180
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,628
That you, Duke?

181
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,705
-Hello, Uncle John.
-Hey, you're kind...

182
00:10:57,773 --> 00:10:59,673
of late, ain't you?

183
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,907
I guess I am, Uncle John.

184
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,777
Who-Who's that...

185
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:10,010
This is Fleety Belle, Uncle John.

186
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:18,652
She-She- She's a swamp
gal, ain't she?

187
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,025
Oh, I guess that's right. But...

188
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,695
But there's some mighty fine
people in the swamps.

189
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,209
You're actin' awful queer, Duke.

190
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,871
You done some thin' bad, ain't ya?

191
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,175
Mighty bad, Uncle John.

192
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,341
What'd you do?

193
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,921
I killed a man.

194
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:54,721
Well, was it on account of her
you done it?

195
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,889
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:10,712
Can Fleety Belle sit down and
get dry, Uncle John?

197
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:16,881
Guess so. Half the Claremore
Queen's yours, ain't it?

198
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,216
It’s all right, Fleety Belle.

199
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,761
Uh, you all ain't had nothin' to
eat, have you?

200
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:40,003
I'd mighty like something
for Fleety Belle.

201
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,438
She's about worn out.

202
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,610
I got-

203
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,948
I got some hot coffee here.

204
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:55,080
I’ll get some bacon in a minute.

205
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,279
Where'd you meet her?

206
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,711
Well, there ain't much to tell.

207
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,646
We was down at Blue Bottom
Bayou back of...

208
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,480
Hannan gettin' out timber.

209
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:28,016
Some swamp people come along
in their shanty boats.

210
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:32,355
I used to wave at 'em, tryin' to
be friends with 'em.

211
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,929
But they'd never wave back
or nothin'.

212
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,363
Just make their womenfolk
get indoors.

213
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:43,471
First time I seen Fleety Belle, I...

214
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,167
I thought she was a boy the way
she was dressed.

215
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,005
Well, I blowed my whistle...

216
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:53,448
and-and she waved back.

217
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:56,541
And her old man came out
and gave her a whippin'.

218
00:13:56,652 --> 00:14:00,554
After that, I seen her pretty
near every, day.

219
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:01,645
Then her folks found out, and
her old man gave...

220
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:04,488
her a worse whippin;

221
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,584
And that's why she run away.

222
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,391
-Was it one of her kinfolks you killed?
-No, sir.

223
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:12,000
-It was Big Steve.
-Who's he?

224
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:15,126
Engineer on the Memphis Girl.

225
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,670
When he found Fleety Belle on
the steamboat...

226
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:18,969
where I was hiding her...

227
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:21,474
he started after her.

228
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,670
You know I don't get mad easy, but...

229
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,373
but when I do, it's like a-like
a thorn tree...

230
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:29,349
a-growin' and growin' inside
of me, and-

231
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,352
Well, we started in fightin'.
He drawed a knife...

232
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,682
and I picked up a chunk of
stove wood and...

233
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,316
throwed it at his hand.

234
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,689
And he ducked right into it,
and I knowed...

235
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:40,786
by the way he fell that he
was dead.

236
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:47,597
Well, then, ain't nobody can say
that that wasn't self-defense.

237
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:53,369
-Did anybody see it?
-Nobody but a-a preacher fella.

238
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,535
-Calls hisself the New Moses.
-I know 'im. I know him.

239
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,910
He come up on the Pride of
Paducah with me.

240
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,450
I sent a message to you by him.
Did he give it to you?

241
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:05,281
Yeah, he told me.

242
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,355
-He-He seen it, huh?
-He seen it.

243
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:11,290
And it was night, and he was
sleepin' on deck.

244
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,726
He didn't blame me none. Just
done a lot of prayin'...

245
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:17,195
and told me to give myself up.

246
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,700
I don't know nothin’ about
religion.

247
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:24,330
But he's right.
He-He's right.

248
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,931
You gotta give yourself up.

249
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,669
There ain't no jury could blame
you for...

250
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,541
doin' a thing like that.

251
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:33,376
Now, come on. Come on and sit
down there. Come sit down.

252
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:37,485
Get you something to eat here now.

253
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,679
Then we'll go on over. We'll
see the sheriff,...

254
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:42,087
and you can give yourself up.

255
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,658
No!

256
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,963
He ain't gonna give his self up.

257
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,691
Listen here. Who asked for any
opinion of...

258
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,667
yours on this thing?

259
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,033
You've done enough to him already.

260
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:59,938
Now, sit down there and get you
something to eat.

261
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,704
He's gonna do as I say. He knows
that he can trust me.

262
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:04,938
No, he ain't gonna do what you say.

263
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,141
We heard tell of this hangin' judge.

264
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,343
Ain't nobody gonna hurt Duke.

265
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:10,719
-Sit down!
-Sit down, Fleety Belle.

266
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,653
Eat some thin'.

267
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,256
Uncle John's right.

268
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,554
There ain't no thin' to run
away from.

269
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:21,994
I told you not to come here. We'd
be safe in the swamp.

270
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,962
Aw, swamps! He's a river man.

271
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,800
He couldn't live in the swamps.
He's not that kind of people.

272
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,961
But they'll hang you, Duke.
I know they will!

273
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,098
Aw, they won't do any such a
thing. They won't hang him.

274
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,742
Don't pay any attention to her,
Duke. She'll...

275
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,506
only get you in worse.

276
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:38,613
You shut up and stop sayin' that!

277
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,715
You're just thinkin' of yourself!
You don't care what...

278
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:42,011
happens to Duke!

279
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,244
Now, honey, Uncle John is-

280
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:46,719
I ain't never had no thin' to love
in my life, and...

281
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,053
I’m not gonna let 'em take you.

282
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,887
Nobody's gonna take me away
from you, honey...

283
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,019
except maybe for a little while.

284
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,721
You and me gotta be free to get
married and-and...

285
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,925
live on this boat.

286
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:04,700
lf you don't come with me now,
you'll never see me again.

287
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:16,411
Come on, son. Let's get on over
and see the sheriff.

288
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:19,214
-You let him alone!
-Now, honey-

289
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,845
-Come on, son.
-I know why you're doin' this.

290
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,685
It’s because you hate me, and
you think I ain't...

291
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,250
good enough for him.

292
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:30,456
Comin', Duke?

293
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:40,098
I’m comin', Uncle John.

294
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,667
But you've gotta take care of
Fleety Belle while I’m gone.

295
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:02,019
Rufe? Rufe?

296
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,099
Sure is quiet up here.

297
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,697
Sleeps right upstairs there.

298
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,865
See if I can wake him up here.
Rufe?

299
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,806
Hello down there. Well,
good heaven Betsy.

300
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,678
What are you doin' down there
this time of night,...

301
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,980
Doc? Can't you let a man sleep?

302
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:27,886
Come on down. Duke... Duke
killed a man.

303
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:32,323
Well, doggone me. Who was it,
Duke? Somebody I knowed?

304
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:35,362
Fella named Big Steve.

305
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:39,491
-Never heard of him.
-Come on-Come on down, Rufe.

306
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:43,469
Now, Doc, there ain't no need of
me comin' down them stairs.

307
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:45,938
Wait just a minute. I’ll
fix you up.

308
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:50,935
Here you be, Duke.

309
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,311
Now just open her up and make
yourself at home.

310
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,214
Take the first bed you take a
liking to. And, Doc...

311
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,253
just hang the keys on the front
doorknob, will ya?

312
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,358
I’ll be seein' you in the mornin'
now about breakfast time.

313
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,655
Good night.

314
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:08,854
Huh.

315
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,989
You'd think somebody killed a man
every day around here...

316
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,364
and come and give their self up.

317
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:38,225
Hey, you. Girl!

318
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,091
Come on inside here now.
Supper's about ready.

319
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:52,974
Sit down.

320
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:56,205
-Sit down!
-I ain't go in' to! You sit down!

321
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:59,314
I don't want nobody wait in' on me.

322
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:07,048
I know you hate me, and
I don't care.

323
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:10,454
Duke told me to stay here, and
I’m gonna do it.

324
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,050
As soon as he gets out, him and
me's goin' away.

325
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:15,823
And we ain't comin' back neither.

326
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,867
Maybe you're goin' away,
but he ain't.

327
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,131
Yes, he is.

328
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:23,872
Now, we'll see about that. I never
knew of any good...

329
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:28,877
comin' of a river man get tin'
mixed up with swamp trash.

330
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:33,974
Hey, look out there! Hey.

331
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:36,642
You know-Say, you're a...

332
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:40,085
You're a spunky little rascal,
you know it?

333
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,281
You-

334
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,285
You kind of got to admire
you at that.

335
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:59,703
-There she is!
-Just wait till I get you home.

336
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:00,740
-No, I ain't a-go in'!
-I’ll beat the hide...

337
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,175
off of you for this...

338
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:04,745
runnin' off with a river man,
shamin' me in...

339
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:05,847
the face of the Lord.

340
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,747
Makin' trash out of herself.
I don't know as I want...

341
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,147
to marry her now.

342
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,549
She'll marry you, Ben, after Pop
gives her a good whoppin'.

343
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:15,020
-Oh, I won't! I won't! I won't!
-You'll shut up!

344
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:17,682
Darn you! I’ll beat the livin'...

345
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,317
-Hold on there!
-Go ahead and beat me!

346
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,396
That's all I ever knowed.
Take me back.

347
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,863
But I won't marry him, and
you can't make me.

348
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:28,403
I’ll run away, and I’ll... I’ll keep
on doin' it till you kill me!

349
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:30,869
Now, you listen to me. And you
don't have to go anywhere.

350
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,770
-Oh, shut up!
-He's just lookin' for trouble.

351
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:34,103
Go ahead. Give it to him.

352
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,200
Ain't no sin runnin' off with
the man you love...

353
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,279
and ain't nobody gonna make
me say it is.

354
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,371
You heard what she said. Now,
go on! Get out of here!

355
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:42,609
-Hit him in the chin, Pop!
-I’ll bust him one!

356
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,709
Go ahead, Ben. Don't take
none of his sass.

357
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,754
Ain't no river man gonna tell
me what to do.

358
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,856
She's my young 'un, and
I got the right.

359
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,925
There ain't nobody gonna tell her
what to do but Duke.

360
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,722
-I’m her pa.
-Yes, and Duke is her husband.

361
00:21:56,865 --> 00:22:01,768
Her and Duke... Her and Duke
was married.

362
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,668
There can't be no thin' wrong
about that, can there?

363
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,741
He's lyin', Pap!

364
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,742
I ain't a-gonna marry her now
no how. I don't want...

365
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,038
no river man's trash!

366
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,978
You bet your life you're
not a-gonna.

367
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,409
Say, just a minute here.

368
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,747
Say, I’ve stood just about
all the insults...

369
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,448
I’m gonna stand out of you people.

370
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:22,750
You can't come in here talkin' to
that girl like that.

371
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:24,951
That's Duke's wife.

372
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,494
-Now get out of here, you swamp
trash! -Now, wait a minute.

373
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,697
-Put that down.

374
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:29,629
-Come on, you swamp rats! Get out of
here!

375
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,394
-Look, Pappy! There's my shoes.
-Hey, drop them shoes!

376
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,527
Ow!

377
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:53,087
Fine lot of kinfolks you got.

378
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,762
I’d mighty like to thank you for
what you've done.

379
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:11,772
Well, you oughta thank me.

380
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:14,967
Hadn't been for me, they'd have
got your shoes.

381
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:17,637
-But-But, I mean, you fixed it...
-Well, yes.

382
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:18,770
lf you hadn't give me the knife,
they might have...

383
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:21,645
got 'em anyhow.

384
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,775
Com in' in here bother in' us just
when we're gonna enjoy...

385
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:26,013
our supper here together.

386
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:27,782
Hmph. That's a fine lot of
kinfolks havin'...

387
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:30,324
like that. Swamp people.

388
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,689
Look at that bacon. Look at that.
It’s all burned.

389
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:35,024
Look. Look at that.

390
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,156
Let me fix it.

391
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:39,995
Huh? What do you know about
coo kin' bacon?

392
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,163
I bet you never did cook no thin'
but catfish.

393
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,205
Hey, what is that-Here.

394
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:56,807
What is that? Is that-Is that an
old tablecloth...

395
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:59,012
of somebody's? Huh?

396
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,089
What is it?

397
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,992
You can't wear a thing like that
to the court-

398
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:15,930
You can't wear... You can't wear
that to the courtroom.

399
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,028
You've got to...

400
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,700
No wonder Duke couldn't tell whether
you was a boy or a girl.

401
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:41,585
Look at that.

402
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:45,359
Sure used to make them
Yanks run in that.

403
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:03,576
Look at that. Huh?

404
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:07,451
That belonged to... That belonged
to Duke's mother.

405
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,683
She was the prettiest woman
I ever saw in my life...

406
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,259
even if she was my sister.

407
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:20,296
She was a skinny little thing,
just like you.

408
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,458
There you go. There you go.

409
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:47,858
Lettin' the bacon burn up that way.

410
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,023
That's all you women think about...
just clothes.

411
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:06,138
Dr. John, do you think any body'll
take me for a swamp girl?

412
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:08,773
Swamp girl? What, in those clothes?

413
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:12,944
No more swamp girl. Say, there's
gals up in the big city...

414
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:16,148
like-like Vicksburg that ain't got
duds like those.

415
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,226
You know where those clothes come
from? Way up to Memphis.

416
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:25,228
Do you think... Do you think
Duke'll like it?

417
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,736
Like it? Say, he ain't even gonna
recognize you at first.

418
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,898
Duke's gonna have two
sweethearts now.

419
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,637
-Two?
-Yeah. Gonna have two.

420
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:39,578
You and the Claremore Queen.

421
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,447
Say, we gotta hurry up here. Let's
get to prancin' here. Come on.

422
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,521
'Twas me done this to Duke.

423
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:59,934
It’s all my fault. I ought to let
him run away like you said.

424
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:04,337
You was right about that
hangin’ judge.

425
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,805
Guess I thought 'cause
I was older...

426
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:11,868
that l-I knew more about right and
wrong than you all did.

427
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,074
Duke ain't blamin' you, Dr. John.

428
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:19,880
I know he ain't. But you are.

429
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,080
I ain't blamin' nobody.

430
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:26,754
You ain't no more surprised
about it than I be, Doc.

431
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:30,389
Aw. You up there supposed to
be savin' a man's life.

432
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,500
Then you're talkin' to the judge
about real estate.

433
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,898
What'd you wanna start an argument
with him for?

434
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:38,404
Well, 'tweren't my fault. You seen
the way he led around to it.

435
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,841
He's held a grudge against me
ever since I sold...

436
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,672
him that bottom land.

437
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,768
'Tweren't my fault the river
run over it.

438
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:47,611
Oh, well, if you'd let me have my
way and let me go find the...

439
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,616
New Moses who's the only man
that saw the thing-

440
00:27:49,718 --> 00:27:50,852
Had him here as a witness, Duke
could've been free...

441
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,820
and out of here.

442
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,446
Aw, shucks. He ain't been
hung yet.

443
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,582
Just wait and see the way I handle
this appeal. I tell you...

444
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,787
You just wait a minute now. You
ain't gonna handle any appeal.

445
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:04,421
You know what I want you to do?
I want you to go down to...

446
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:07,330
Baton Rouge and I want you to
get a... get a good lawyer.

447
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,633
Get the best lawyer you can get.
Get a-Get a smart lawyer.

448
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,731
Cost a heap of money.

449
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,776
Them big fellows wouldn't even
worry about Duke...

450
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:18,574
for less than $500.

451
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,648
Five hundred dollars?

452
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:28,750
Well, if his life ain't worth $500,
it ain't worth nothin'.

453
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,824
You go get the lawyer, will ya?
You get the lawyer.

454
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,860
I’ll get the $500 somehow
or another.

455
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,560
Come on, honey.

456
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,766
Howdy, Doc!

457
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:52,876
Oh, hello, Rufe.

458
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,382
Mighty sorry to hear about the way
Duke's case turned out.

459
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,885
Well, ain't hung him yet.

460
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:02,286
That's the truth as I see it.

461
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:05,916
They ain't goin' to either.

462
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,324
What-What's that you got there?

463
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,761
Why, ain't you heard? Why,
Professor Marvel done...

464
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,391
skipped town owin' everybody.

465
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,559
Left his whole show and the
calliope and everything.

466
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,332
Come on in and see the show, honey.
It'll cheer you right up.

467
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,068
They got a dead fish in here.
They call it a whale.

468
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,768
Why, the whole tent's just chuck
full of things...

469
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,471
that'll give you the shivers.

470
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:26,547
Come on in. Yes, sir.

471
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:29,583
All the greatest folks in history,
from John the Baptist...

472
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,084
plumb down to the king of England.

473
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,246
There's Little Eva sittin' there.

474
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:37,654
Old Uncle Tom's layin' around
here somewheres.

475
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:46,698
You know the story of Little
Eva, honey?

476
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:49,497
-No.
-Well, just as well.

477
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:53,899
Oh, here. Lookee. It’s Daniel Boone.

478
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,033
-That Daniel Boone?
-That's Daniel Boone.

479
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:59,113
You-You know the story
of Daniel Boone?

480
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:01,442
-No.
-I’ll tell you that sometime.

481
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,916
That's a-That's a great story.

482
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,817
Oh, here. Look here. I’ll bet
that's the old bloodhound,...

483
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,412
ain't it, Sheriff?

484
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,524
Huh?

485
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:13,456
Got ya there, Doc.

486
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,620
Lookee here. You see that
statue there?

487
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:18,323
-Uh-huh.
-That's Ulysses S. Grant.

488
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,959
-Yeah? Who's that?
-Oh.

489
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,934
-The woman leadin' the horse?
-Yeah.

490
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,039
Why, that's Victory,.

491
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:28,404
Ain't it just like some durned
Yankee to let the lady walk?

492
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,002
They do it every time. But
lookee here, Doc.

493
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:34,916
I’ll bet you this here's somethin'
that you ain't...

494
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,645
never seen before.

495
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,920
There's been a heap of argument
around town...

496
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,013
about this here whale.

497
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,350
And Professor Marvel, now,
he claimed that...

498
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:46,688
it's the very identical whale that
swallowed Jonah.

499
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:49,262
Well, it looks old enough to be.

500
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:51,524
Yes, and look here at the size of
this here mouth.

501
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,601
Ain't nobody in here.

502
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:55,760
Thunderation!

503
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,906
Ain't nobody in here, white folks.

504
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:59,032
-Holy Moses!
-Moses nothin'.

505
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:01,965
-Say, that's Jonah.
-No, it's just me.

506
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:04,044
I worked for the doctor, and I just...

507
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,807
Well, come on out of there now.
Ain't nobody gonna harm you.

508
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:09,042
-What you doin' in there?
-Nothin'. I was just-

509
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,345
Thought you thought I was Mr...

510
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:12,351
Professor, and l-

511
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,683
Say. Say, wait a minute here, Rufe.

512
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,883
You know, I got an idea. See what
you think of this, Fleety.

513
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,256
What do you say... You want to get
your money out of this, don't ya?

514
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,352
Sure do.

515
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,431
What do you say you let me take
this on the Claremore Queen...

516
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,534
and I’ll soon have your money back.

517
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:28,761
And we can get Duke that appeal
lawyer too.

518
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:31,394
Well, I don't see how nobody can
kick about that.

519
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:34,064
-Do you go with this?
-Yes, sir, I works here.

520
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:38,578
I play the banjo and the mouth
organ and the calliope and...

521
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,648
-Calliope?
-Yes, sir, and the...

522
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:42,875
-What's your name?
-Well, I was baptized...

523
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,249
David Begat Solomon, but...

524
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:48,322
-David Begat what?
-David Begat Solomon.

525
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:51,483
But I changed it to George Lincoln
Washington.

526
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:52,890
Well, now, listen. lf you're goin'
with me, we're gonna...

527
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:54,326
stick to the Bible.

528
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,422
-You're Jonah.
-Yes, sir. But I can't swim.

529
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:41,491
Where do you want this
virgin queen?

530
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:43,570
Put her there by her husband.

531
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:46,139
What do I know about a king and
queen anyhow?

532
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,233
All I ever did do is sell medicine
up and down this river here.

533
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:52,608
But I’ll tell you, if we get right
down to earth...

534
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:54,875
and we can change these people
around into people these...

535
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,110
folks on the river wanna see...

536
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:59,209
we can make a lot of money.

537
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,311
Now, for instance, who-who's
your favorite female?

538
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:03,390
-Pocahontas.
-Pocahontas. That's great.

539
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:05,686
Now, we'll just make Pocahontas
out of her, see?

540
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,829
Get some feathers and some
paint and all.

541
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:09,888
Who was the feller she was with?
What was his name?

542
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:11,965
-Captain John Smith.
-Captain John-Here-

543
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,125
Here's Captain John Smith
right here.

544
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:17,931
Over here, we'll take this fella.
The gentleman here is...

545
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:20,940
'King George'-One, two, three.
King George III.

546
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:21,974
I never heard of him. We'll make
that gentleman...

547
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:25,105
into George Washington.

548
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,408
That's who it is. And this
one over here...

549
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,540
we'll take him...

550
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:32,980
Hey, hey.

551
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:35,282
Hey, that's Napoleon.

552
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,584
Better leave him alone.

553
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:42,186
Uh-Now, here. Here's these two
New Moseses here.

554
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:44,287
I think they're old prophets
of some kind.

555
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:46,798
But there ain't nobody interested
in prophets nowadays.

556
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,869
I tell you, we'll make outlaws
out of them.

557
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,971
-Frank and Jesse James.
-That's great. That's-

558
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:53,039
Everybody wants to see the
James boys.

559
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,903
Pop, I just now done told you,
Topsy goes back...

560
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,346
there with Uncle Tom.

561
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:04,475
You know good and well she
don't goes with Napoleon.

562
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:10,251
Here's Mr. Ulysses S. Grant,
Mr. Doctor.

563
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,418
Grant? Oh, say. I just happened
to think.

564
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,519
Say, we got to go right
by Vicksburg.

565
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,190
And they ain't never forgot
down there.

566
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:20,664
No wonder old Professor
Marvel skipped town.

567
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:21,860
You know, I knew a fellow that
got run out of...

568
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:24,666
Vicksburg for just lookin'
like him.

569
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:27,172
I tell you, if you all don't
want him...

570
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:30,472
this uniform just about fits me.

571
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:34,173
You'll have to change him to
somebody else.

572
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:36,250
Say, I’m gonna change him.
You know what I’ll do?

573
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,341
Take that old cigar out of
his mouth...

574
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:41,615
and we'll make him Robert E. Lee.

575
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:57,870
I been waitin' here kind of hop in'
you'd come.

576
00:35:58,005 --> 00:36:00,166
Gets mighty lonesome sometimes.

577
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:04,301
I had to come.
We're leaving tomorrow.

578
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,846
Ain't no thin' nicer than...

579
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:09,576
go in' up and down the river.

580
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:13,082
Dr. John's got the appeal lawyer.

581
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,655
He's gonna send you the money
fast as we take it in.

582
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:19,590
I sure would like to be in them
river towns and see your show.

583
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:23,228
Oh, it's mighty beautiful.

584
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,861
Fella in here used to work in a
tattoo parlor in...

585
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,903
Perryville, and-

586
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:33,303
Well, I kind of been get tin' some
tattoo in' done myself.

587
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:37,110
I wished I could see it.

588
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,638
Well-

589
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:47,119
See what it says under the heart?

590
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:49,223
It’s my name.

591
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,784
I’ve been learn in' to play
the saw too.

592
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,193
I wish I could hear it.

593
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:07,937
I only know one tune, and...

594
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,174
I don't know that very good.

595
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:30,982
There's some thin' I gotta tell
you, Fleety Belle.

596
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:35,357
You know that girl that waits on
table across the street?

597
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:38,956
Well, l-I waved at her once.

598
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:44,098
I’ll bet she waved at you first.

599
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,911
I’ve gotta go.

600
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:55,574
Fleety Belle, you ain't...

601
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:57,617
ain't never kissed me yet.

602
00:39:25,312 --> 00:39:28,770
Put it over a little bit. Put
it over a little.

603
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:32,443
A little more there. Now just
hold it steady.

604
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:35,487
You don't want me to run into that
sandbar, do you, Captain John?

605
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:39,320
Hmm? What-Hey, hey! Look out there!
Say, wait a minute there.

606
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:47,890
Hey, you got to make up your mind
who you're gonna...

607
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,334
take orders from-

608
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:52,497
me or you.

609
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:54,972
Now, hold her right there now.
Right there.

610
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:57,135
You think I’m learnin'?

611
00:39:57,244 --> 00:40:00,805
Say, you takin' to the river just
like an old turtle.

612
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:04,475
lf you listen to me, you'll be the
best pilot on the whole river...

613
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:07,382
outside of Duke and me.

614
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,753
I sure would like to get back
and see Duke.

615
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:15,420
You ain't, uh, getting tired of
my company already.

616
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:18,362
Why, you know that ain't so.

617
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:21,094
I ain't never had a dream like this.

618
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:24,694
I ain't never knowed nobody
like you.

619
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:27,569
Why, you bought me dresses
and pretty things...

620
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,042
like I ain't never see'd before.

621
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:34,273
Sometimes, when we're goin'
down the river at night...

622
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:36,815
I get to thinkin' about Duke...

623
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:40,318
and what you done for him and me.

624
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:43,948
Seems like I can hardly stand it.

625
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:47,994
I feel like the Lord's just shamin'
me for having hated you so.

626
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:50,563
Yeah.

627
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:53,155
Don't have to... worry about...

628
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:56,100
The Lord's a lot broad-minded than
you think he is anyhow.

629
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,966
Put her over a little bit. Look out
for this bend.

630
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,006
That's it. Hold it steady.

631
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:05,836
Steamboat round the bend!

632
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:08,881
Hey, that's the river talk! Steamboat
round the bend.

633
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,884
Steamboat round the bend!
Here she comes.

634
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:15,888
Hey, you know what that is? That's
the Pride of Paducah.

635
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:18,457
It’s old Captain Eli.

636
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,255
Want to just give that old snap pin'
turtle a toot here...

637
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:26,527
-to show him my boat can toot
louder than his.

638
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:40,347
Hey, Doc!

639
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:43,177
Don't forget I’m gonna own that
old mud scow...

640
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,785
when I win this race!

641
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,945
Yeah, the only time you ever gon'
pass me is when...

642
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:50,286
you go in' the other way.

643
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,390
Say, what are you on that museum...

644
00:41:54,495 --> 00:41:56,554
the mummy?

645
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,297
And, say, you better stay away
from Salt Creek.

646
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:07,396
They lynched one of them hootchy
kootchy shows there last week.

647
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:10,601
Where was you sittin', on
the front row?

648
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:13,203
I sure was!

649
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:16,839
Cramp 'er, Mink! Cramp 'er!

650
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:19,350
You know, Captain John...

651
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,717
maybe he's right about Salt Creek.

652
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:24,824
Oh, that old bullfrog don't know
what he's talking about.

653
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:25,916
Salt Creek's the last town we gonna
show anything.

654
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:27,994
Then we going home.

655
00:42:28,996 --> 00:42:31,055
See Duke.

656
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:35,358
Oh! Now, look, say, don't do that.

657
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,959
There ain't no thin' run you on the
sandbar quicker...

658
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:39,597
than a lot of hug gin' and kiss in'.

659
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:41,766
I didn't mean to.

660
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:45,402
You didn't mean to? Well, that's
a fine thing to say.

661
00:42:45,512 --> 00:42:49,175
lf you didn't mean to, maybe I’d
better give it back.

662
00:42:52,686 --> 00:42:53,983
Too much foolishness go in'
on around here.

663
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:56,113
Change your clothes quick now.

664
00:42:56,257 --> 00:42:58,316
Put on a fancy dress.

665
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:59,915
Gonna show those folks in
Salt Creek some...

666
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,961
fancy pilot in' now.

667
00:43:01,962 --> 00:43:06,456
Give 'em a little toot.

668
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:13,971
Oh, say, there's a lot of folks
com in' tonight!

669
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:16,943
It looks like the biggest night
we've had in a long time.

670
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,501
Come on.

671
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:20,773
Got some change? Get up
in there now.

672
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:22,711
Come on, Jonah. Get that started.

673
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:38,554
Well, well, well, now. Well,
welcome, brother.

674
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:41,134
Welcome to Dr. John's Floating
Museum.

675
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:44,068
The show is just about to start, so
get your tickets right here.

676
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:46,230
There ain't gonna be no show.

677
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,968
No? Just, uh-Just where did you,
uh, get that...

678
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,568
information, brother?

679
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,341
'Cause we're gonna chop up your
boat, mister.

680
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:58,417
-Yeah, and burn it up too!
-We'll give you a trail to travel!

681
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,247
And a bucket of tar for that gal!

682
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:02,345
Come on. Let's pull this museum
out of here!

683
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:18,933
Mr. Efe! Mr. Efe! They're tear in'
the boat down,...

684
00:44:19,006 --> 00:44:20,735
them gentlemen!

685
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,934
Mr. Doc and Miss Fleety and them
standing round...

686
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,843
there, lookin' round!

687
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:28,312
I never been so scared in
all my life!

688
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:32,180
They got pickaxes and they
got ax handles...

689
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:47,060
-Stand back there!
-Hold up your hands!

690
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:49,533
-Look out, pappy! He's got a gun!
-I see him.

691
00:44:49,636 --> 00:44:52,799
-I’m gon'shoot!
-Wait a minute, boys!

692
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:55,966
Don't shoot. Just hold that till I tell
you. They've got the...

693
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:57,977
wrong impression.

694
00:44:58,078 --> 00:44:59,909
-This ain't no show.
-How come she ain't a show?

695
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,504
You got a 'calli-oop.'

696
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:06,108
Yeah, I know. But this is a museum.
It’s educational!

697
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:07,914
-How come she's educational?
-Well, because...

698
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:10,479
because it is, that's why!

699
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:11,922
Now, un cock your guns, boys,
because you may...

700
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:14,222
let 'em go off accidentally.

701
00:45:14,328 --> 00:45:17,820
Just hold it until I tell you to.

702
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:22,231
It’s educational. Did you ever see
a petrified man? Huh?

703
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:26,272
No, you never did. Well, we got
one in there. Ain't we, honey?

704
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:29,570
We got one in there, and he's
2,000 years old.

705
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:33,578
I’m gonna let you all come in there
and see with your own eyes...

706
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,114
and it ain't gonna cost you one nickel.

707
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:37,979
And if everything that I’ve told
you about out here ain't in...

708
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:40,246
there just like I told ya...

709
00:45:40,387 --> 00:45:43,220
then you can come out
and chop it down.

710
00:45:48,028 --> 00:45:50,997
Now, friends, there ain't nobody
that rightfully...

711
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:52,998
knows just how old she is.

712
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,000
There is people that say a whale
grows an inch...

713
00:45:55,068 --> 00:45:56,933
every hundred years.

714
00:45:57,037 --> 00:46:00,006
So, well, you can figure it out
for yourself.

715
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:03,338
That's not a fish. This ain't a
fish. That's a mammal.

716
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:05,605
-It’s a...
-A mammal.

717
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:09,170
Well, I mean it raises its young
just like a cow does.

718
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:11,443
Yes!

719
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:14,577
And it breathes just the same
as you and l.

720
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:15,949
And when it gets waterlogged, it
blows it out through...

721
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,491
these breathing places in its head.

722
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:21,686
I’ll show you. Efe, let her
breathe a little.

723
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:27,799
Pappy, it breathed all over me!

724
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:31,064
There you are. Now, is she
educational, or ain't she?

725
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,642
There's a powerful lot of learning
in a whale.

726
00:46:36,743 --> 00:46:37,971
Neighbor, this thing is worth
payin' for.

727
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,275
I’m glad to hear you say that.

728
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,816
-Rex, pass the hat.
-Come on, Rex.

729
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:47,216
Rex, better get your pappy's hat.
Yours leaks.

730
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:48,982
Over this way, gentlemen, you have
George Washington,...

731
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,183
the father of his country!

732
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:54,055
You can't leave without
seein' Pappy!

733
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:55,992
I told you on the outside that l
had George Washington...

734
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,224
here. I wasn't lyin' to ya.

735
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,932
Friends, that certainly is
a fine man!

736
00:47:05,038 --> 00:47:06,938
All my life I’ve thought that
about him and what...

737
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,305
he's done for our country.

738
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,933
-Will you be here tomorrow?
-No, I’m sorry.

739
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,979
I won't be here tomorrow.

740
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,945
I sure would like to have my old
woman see him, if she...

741
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:17,575
could get away from her plowin'.

742
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:18,946
She got a picture of him, and
ain't more than a week...

743
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:21,544
goes by she don't look at it.

744
00:47:21,655 --> 00:47:22,952
Well, I’m awful sorry, but we got
to be in Beaver...

745
00:47:23,023 --> 00:47:25,321
Slough tomorrow.

746
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,949
-They're waitin' for us.
-Don't suppose you could spare...

747
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:29,894
me a piece of his hair, could ya?

748
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:32,192
Well, no, I don't...

749
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:33,960
Me and her'd be mighty proud to
have a piece of...

750
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:36,730
George Washington's hair.

751
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,599
Well, I’m gonna give you a little
piece here.

752
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,612
Of course, I don't want you to have
to make your wife quit plowin'.

753
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:51,582
There it is. You be very careful of
that. Take good care of that.

754
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:54,621
Right over this way, gentlemen!
Right over here!

755
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:57,057
Call your attention to the stage!
All right, Fleety...

756
00:47:57,057 --> 00:47:59,719
Belle, Efe, Jonah.

757
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:05,861
Gentlemen, General Robert E. Lee.

758
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,067
Look away, look away Look away,
Dixieland

759
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:15,073
Attention!

760
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:17,870
I wish I was in Dixie, I say, I say

761
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,077
Away, away A-way down South
in Dixie.

762
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:28,176
Away, away A-way down South
in Dixie.

763
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,449
I wish I was in the land of cotton.

764
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:32,389
Old times there is not forgotten.

765
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:37,088
Look away, look away Look
away, Dixieland.

766
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:47,601
-Come on.
-Howdy there, Doc, Fleety Belle!

767
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,471
Hello! Hello!

768
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:51,771
-Hello!
-Hello, Sheriff.

769
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:53,004
The way this gal drag you up that
hill, you'd think...

770
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,640
she wanted to see somebody.

771
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:57,943
How's Duke?

772
00:48:58,085 --> 00:48:59,950
Oh, fine as a frog hair. Never
knowed a man...

773
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,250
could keep so happy.

774
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,416
Wait'll you hear him play
on that saw.

775
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:08,961
Man, he really whips 'er. And he
eats more'n a horse.

776
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:10,962
You wanna feed him good,
'cause there ain't...

777
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,727
nothin' too good for Duke.

778
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:17,463
That's the truth as I see it. Sure
hate to see him get hung.

779
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:20,972
What are you talking about?
Why are you joking...

780
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,236
about a thing like that?

781
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:26,278
Ain't you heard? The court done
turned down his appeal.

782
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,974
-Who said so?
-Doc, I’m sorry.

783
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,074
I thought you knowed.

784
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,981
I got my orders in my pocket.
I gotta take him to...

785
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,613
Baton Rouge tomorrow night.

786
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:49,427
Duke!

787
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:52,333
Duke!

788
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:57,799
Fleety Belle.

789
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:01,745
-Duke, it ain't so, is it?
-I guess it is.

790
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:05,045
They can't take you, Duke.
They can't!

791
00:50:05,185 --> 00:50:07,745
Aw, don't cry, honey.

792
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:12,450
I guess things just gotta
be that way.

793
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,360
I’d just about die if I never was
married to you.

794
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:23,935
Oh, dear, you're such a skinny
little thing.

795
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:27,063
You know, my Bonnie Lou got
married in this dress.

796
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:29,039
She was a little stouter than
you are, though.

797
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,371
It’s awful pretty.

798
00:50:30,477 --> 00:50:33,037
Dear, I wished I had some
orange blossoms.

799
00:50:33,146 --> 00:50:35,706
Don't seem like no weddin' without
no orange blossoms.

800
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:40,683
Addie May, dear, run along and fix
the flowers. That's a good girl.

801
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:44,188
Yes, sir, Duke, I’m gonna give you
a real good 'un.

802
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,054
This makes 13 folks that I’ve
married what...

803
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,354
was gonna get hung.

804
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:49,657
I guess that's a record.

805
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,166
Sheriff down in Big Bend, he
claimed he done 14.

806
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:55,064
But never was nobody could find
where it was...

807
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,659
put down in a book.

808
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,964
Now, these 'uns I done.

809
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:01,006
Every one of' em is wrote right
here in my family Bible,...

810
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:03,235
where anybody can see 'em.

811
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:05,937
-Uh, everything's ready, Pop.
-That's fine, Addie May.

812
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:08,810
Got your flowers all put around?
That's good.

813
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:11,611
Doc, got the piano set.

814
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:14,118
Guess we're about ready to go.

815
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:16,950
Now, Addie May, can you play
the 'Wedding March'?

816
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,860
Can't play nothing but 'Listen to
the Mockingbird.'

817
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,055
I reckon that'll have to do.
We gotta have some...

818
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:24,495
music to get the bride in here.

819
00:51:24,598 --> 00:51:26,065
Run on over to the piano, dear.
We'll be ready...

820
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:28,727
in just a minute.

821
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,532
-Ma! Oh, Ma! 'Bout ready?
-Yeah! We're a-waitin'.

822
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,971
Won't be but a minute.

823
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:36,064
Pappy, you gotta give her away,
'cause you done it for...

824
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:38,509
me when you was in here last time.

825
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:41,012
Bub, let the boys in.

826
00:51:41,148 --> 00:51:43,850
Now, you boys quiet down and
get settled now.

827
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,078
Don't wanna have no disturbance.
Gonna start the...

828
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:47,052
ceremony in just a minute.

829
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,953
Doc, the old jail looks kinda
cheerful, don't it?

830
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:53,025
Yeah.

831
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,060
Go ahead, dear. Go ahead.

832
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:08,396
All right, begin, Addie May.

833
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:32,097
Friends...

834
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:35,066
we are gathered here in the
eyes of God...

835
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:37,626
and one another...

836
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:42,538
for the purpose of joining together...

837
00:52:42,642 --> 00:52:48,444
this here man and this here woman
in holy matrimony.

838
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:53,246
Can't nobody rightly say
nothin' agin marriage...

839
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:57,585
'cause I reckon God intended...

840
00:52:57,691 --> 00:53:00,353
every, body to live that-a-way.

841
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,294
Cause every, living human
on this earth...

842
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:06,922
has got to find his mate...

843
00:53:07,033 --> 00:53:09,524
sometime or other.

844
00:53:09,636 --> 00:53:12,036
And when God put Noah
in the ark...

845
00:53:12,138 --> 00:53:16,199
he told him to take two of
everything.

846
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:18,869
'Cause God knowed that
was right...

847
00:53:18,979 --> 00:53:23,245
and I guess he knowed what
it was to be lonesome.

848
00:53:23,383 --> 00:53:27,649
Now, if Duke and Fleety
Belle here...

849
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:30,655
had a notion...

850
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:34,488
they're only carrying out the
Word of God.

851
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:37,927
And right here
I wanna say a word about Duke.

852
00:53:38,031 --> 00:53:43,435
There ain't never been a finer man...

853
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:45,366
in this here jail.

854
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,635
That's the truth as I see it.

855
00:53:48,775 --> 00:53:51,073
Course, we're all mighty sorry,
that Duke's gotta...

856
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,669
go and get himself hung.

857
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,715
Don't seem just-just right.

858
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,080
But that ain't got nothin' to do
with this ceremony,...

859
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,450
I guess. Has it, Doc?

860
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,491
All right, Duke...

861
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:10,654
do you take this here woman to be
your lawful wedded wife...

862
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:12,857
until death do ye part?

863
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:14,695
I do.

864
00:54:14,801 --> 00:54:18,737
And you, Fleety Belle, do you
take this here man...

865
00:54:18,872 --> 00:54:21,067
for your lawful wedded husband...

866
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,335
until death do ye part?

867
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:25,034
I do.

868
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,844
You got a ring, Duke?

869
00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:35,284
I got it.

870
00:54:41,394 --> 00:54:45,763
Just put it on her finger there.

871
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:50,131
That looks like it might have been
your mother's, son.

872
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:52,872
-It was.
-All right.

873
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:57,070
I now pronounce you man and wife...

874
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,203
until death do ye part.

875
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:03,714
Go ahead and kiss her, son.

876
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:37,547
Hurry up now, Duke.

877
00:55:37,817 --> 00:55:41,048
Here she comes!

878
00:55:41,154 --> 00:55:44,521
Yeah. Darned ol' train. It would
be on time.

879
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:47,320
Duke 'n' me be down in Baton Rouge
before midnight.

880
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:51,056
I hate to do this, Duke, but it's
according to the law.

881
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:53,655
I guess you done all you
could, Rufe.

882
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,632
They ain't takin' you!

883
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:58,727
Go on, Duke! Get away!

884
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:01,898
Ain't no sense in that. I don't
wanna get you in trouble.

885
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:04,033
Or you either, Uncle John. I don't
wanna get you...

886
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,442
in no trouble either, Rufe.

887
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:08,673
You been mighty good to me.

888
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:12,444
Oh, that's all right, Duke. I ain't
holdin' no grudge.

889
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:15,544
Well, guess I kinda lost my
head too.

890
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:17,850
I wanted to see him get away.

891
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:22,018
Don't cry, honey. Rufe ain't gonna
hold nothin' against ya.

892
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,655
Don't reckon we'll be needin' these
handcuffs none, Duke.

893
00:56:25,765 --> 00:56:29,201
All aboard!
-Come on, let's get on.

894
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,950
Go ahead, Duke.

895
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:05,135
Don't you worry, honey.

896
00:57:05,238 --> 00:57:08,332
You know what we gonna do?
You know?

897
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:12,036
We gonna get on that boat and we
gonna go all up...

898
00:57:12,112 --> 00:57:14,239
and down that river.

899
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:19,717
And we're gonna hunt and hunt till
we- till we find the New Moses.

900
00:57:19,819 --> 00:57:22,014
We'll find him somewhere.

901
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,390
Hey, brother, you seen anything
of the New Moses?

902
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:38,665
Yes, sir! He was down in the swamp
baptizin' about a week ago!

903
00:57:54,454 --> 00:57:59,118
Hello, friends! Hey, have you seen
anything of the New Moses?

904
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:03,355
Brother, he was here two weeks ago...

905
00:58:03,463 --> 00:58:06,432
and I ain't had a drop since!

906
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,039
Uncle John, come here!
Look!

907
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,301
What is it? Huh?

908
00:58:16,442 --> 00:58:19,741
Oh! Say, that does look like a
baptizin'. That might be him.

909
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:21,905
Pull over here.

910
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:28,245
Hey! Hey, brothers! Is that
the New Moses?

911
00:58:28,354 --> 00:58:32,586
No, brother, but I am the
New Elijah!

912
00:58:32,692 --> 00:58:35,923
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

913
00:58:36,029 --> 00:58:39,021
Hallelujah!

914
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:41,600
No. It’s the wrong prophet.

915
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:49,142
Folks out there don't look like
they seen...

916
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:51,406
anybody com in' through here.

917
00:58:51,544 --> 00:58:55,002
Hey, brothers! You seen anything
of the New Moses?

918
00:58:56,649 --> 00:58:59,948
Brother, I ain't even seen the
old Moses!

919
00:59:02,855 --> 00:59:05,585
Fresh thing. Hmph.

920
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:09,856
-Your joke's old enough
- you ought have seen the old Moses.

921
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,101
Looks like we've missed him
everywhere we've...

922
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:17,262
gone, Fleety Belle.

923
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:19,105
Duke ain't got much time
left, Uncle John.

924
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:21,471
I know that.

925
00:59:21,574 --> 00:59:25,442
I been racking my brain every
night and day...

926
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:27,741
since the thing happened.

927
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,117
l-I don't know. I just wouldn't
wanna go on...

928
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:33,483
livin' if they hang that boy.

929
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,781
I ain't goin' to neither.

930
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:38,083
But they ain't gonna hang Duke.

931
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:40,091
I’m not sayin' we're gonna save
him, but they...

932
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,753
ain't gonna hang him.

933
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:45,057
I don't know.

934
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,792
Nobody but the Lord knows
about that.

935
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:51,635
Ain't got but two days left.

936
00:59:51,738 --> 00:59:55,799
Say, wait, I got a no-T-Take
the wheel and hold it.

937
00:59:55,908 --> 00:59:59,105
Let me think a minute. You know
what I’m gonna do?

938
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:02,214
I’m goin' right and see the governor.

939
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,111
-Could ya?
-Yes! Well, they say he...

940
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,981
ain't forgot us old soldiers.

941
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:09,611
You know, I remember
him at Shiloh.

942
01:00:09,722 --> 01:00:12,748
He was certainly dealin' them
Yankees...

943
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,089
a powerful lot of misery there then.

944
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,128
I’m just gonna go see him and
tell him that we...

945
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,629
can't find the New Moses...

946
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:20,926
and this is not Duke's fault.

947
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,195
Let's put her around now.

948
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:27,239
We'll turn right around and take
her into Baton Rouge.

949
01:00:31,477 --> 01:00:35,243
Oh, what's the idea of his comin'
up here now?

950
01:00:35,348 --> 01:00:38,875
Don't he know we got a race on?

951
01:00:42,422 --> 01:00:45,880
Say, what's he doin'? Wavin'
us in there?

952
01:00:45,992 --> 01:00:49,826
Go back, will ya! Go back, I say!

953
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:51,920
We're gonna have a race!

954
01:00:52,031 --> 01:00:54,158
Hey! What's the idea wavin'
us in there?

955
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,428
We goin' on up the river!

956
01:00:56,536 --> 01:00:59,562
The river's been cleared for
the race, Doc!

957
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:02,641
Nobody can get through until
they get away!

958
01:01:02,775 --> 01:01:06,267
Get that floatin' henhouse
out of the way!

959
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:10,348
Henhouse? What's he doing, calling
this thing a henhouse?

960
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:12,451
What are you talking about?

961
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:17,520
Why don't you do as I tell you
and go back?

962
01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:19,887
What do you mean, callin'
this a henhouse?

963
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:22,017
Henhouse! Can't you understand
English?

964
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:25,927
I said go back, not up river!

965
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:31,762
I-Aww.

966
01:01:33,706 --> 01:01:35,139
Now, you captains ain't gonna
start until...

967
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,768
the cannons go off.

968
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:40,242
Then you can do what you please.

969
01:01:40,313 --> 01:01:43,146
The first boat that reaches Baton
Rouge wins the...

970
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:45,241
race as well as the prize...

971
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:48,344
from the governor's own hand.

972
01:01:48,421 --> 01:01:51,788
Here, Clay, hey, what's the idea
of flaggin' me in here?

973
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:54,951
Sorry, Doc, but you know the
rules of the race.

974
01:01:55,027 --> 01:01:58,053
I’m not in the race. I’m tryin' to
get to Baton Rouge.

975
01:01:58,197 --> 01:02:00,290
Oh, no, you ain't, either.

976
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:03,392
I knowed you'd try to back
out of that race.

977
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:08,098
Scared you'll lose that old
chicken coop.

978
01:02:08,174 --> 01:02:10,108
Chicken coop, nothin'. You still
wanna bet the Pride of Paducah...

979
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:12,803
against the Claremore Queen?

980
01:02:12,945 --> 01:02:15,140
As I recall, that was the
terms of the bet,...

981
01:02:15,214 --> 01:02:17,444
unless you're crawfishing.

982
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,778
Winner takes both boats.

983
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:26,315
Is that so? Well, I’ll just take
you up on that.

984
01:02:26,426 --> 01:02:28,155
I’ll bet you my boat against
yours, whole hog...

985
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:30,991
or none with me.

986
01:02:31,097 --> 01:02:33,156
I’ll go in the race. It’ll slow
me up going to...

987
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:35,291
Baton Rouge, but I’ll go in.

988
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:37,301
What time do we start?

989
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:40,372
Sergeant Benson shoots off that
cannon in five minutes.

990
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:42,168
Now, wait. Give me time to load
on some firewood.

991
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:44,004
I’m purt' near out.

992
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,774
Same ol' Pokey-hontas.

993
01:02:46,913 --> 01:02:49,313
Always full of alibis.

994
01:02:49,415 --> 01:02:51,883
You couldn't win if you put
wings on!

995
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:55,886
She starts when the gun goes off.
That's the rules.

996
01:02:55,988 --> 01:03:00,357
You fellas better hurry and get
on your boats.

997
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,987
I’ll lay the course, Mink.

998
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:32,580
I don't wanna start off by running
over them floatin' waxworks.

999
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:35,252
Get ready, Cap. Cannon's about
to go 'boom!'

1000
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:37,522
Get ready below!

1001
01:03:39,832 --> 01:03:42,858
Hey, come on there, Fleety Belle.
Don't be standin' around.

1002
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:44,163
-Are we really goin' in the race?
-Sure. We got to get...

1003
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,330
down the river anyhow.

1004
01:03:46,439 --> 01:03:48,168
Ready!

1005
01:03:48,274 --> 01:03:50,435
Hey, Doc, better hug close
to shore!

1006
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:53,204
No tellin' when that ol' honey
wagon's gonna sink.

1007
01:03:53,346 --> 01:03:55,644
Aw, you shut up, you old...

1008
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,546
Uh, hush up.

1009
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:10,092
Hey, Efe! Stand by now! Full head
of steam on all the time!

1010
01:04:10,196 --> 01:04:12,391
Come on, honey.

1011
01:04:12,498 --> 01:04:14,728
Let me get it, now.

1012
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:16,131
I wanna get a flyin' start. That's
the boat we got...

1013
01:04:16,202 --> 01:04:18,898
to beat, this Pride of Paducah.

1014
01:04:19,005 --> 01:04:21,667
Hey, Uncle Jeff, throw off your
spring line!

1015
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:18,762
We way ahead! Look here!
Lemme show ya!

1016
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:22,561
They way back there! See 'em
back there?

1017
01:05:27,106 --> 01:05:31,770
You can see that Cherokee boat,
they way back there!

1018
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:33,139
But that Pride of Paducah is
right up there!

1019
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:35,772
I believe it's gon' slip by!

1020
01:05:35,881 --> 01:05:39,009
Better get some more of that
steam, if you can, in there!

1021
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:46,323
We out in front now, if we can
just hold it.

1022
01:05:46,425 --> 01:05:48,154
Yeah, but the Cherokee's catching
up with us.

1023
01:05:48,227 --> 01:05:50,491
Holler down to Efe!

1024
01:05:50,596 --> 01:05:53,963
-Tell him to pour the wood to 'er.
-Efe, what steam you carryin'?

1025
01:06:03,442 --> 01:06:05,103
I’m just a-wonderin', Mink, where
we gonna put...

1026
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:07,407
that prize when we win it tomorrow.

1027
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,208
Down in the clerk's office?

1028
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:13,785
Uh, in the pilot's house,
I should say.

1029
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:16,353
Well, maybe that would be best.

1030
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,700
Uncle John, look! It’s the
New Moses!

1031
01:07:02,835 --> 01:07:05,998
But-Say, it is the New Moses!
It is!

1032
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,936
Pull it over! Pull right over!

1033
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:12,707
Pull her over! Pull her over!
Pull her over! Pull her over!

1034
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:18,744
Away! Away!

1035
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:37,660
Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah!

1036
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:40,705
-Hallelujah!
-Be careful!

1037
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:43,366
Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah!

1038
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:47,279
-Hallelujah!
-Get him on the boat, quick!

1039
01:07:47,279 --> 01:07:50,840
-Hallelujah!
-Glory, be! Hallelujah!

1040
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:53,350
Glory, be! Hallelujah!

1041
01:07:53,452 --> 01:07:56,717
Hallelujah! Glory be! Glory be!

1042
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,256
-Hallelujah!
-Glory be!

1043
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:04,521
Brother, what are you doing here?

1044
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:07,827
-Helpin' to win a race.
-Race? Gambling?

1045
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:09,992
-Devil's work!
-Oh, no, no!

1046
01:08:10,102 --> 01:08:12,127
This is a race to save a life.
It’s Duke. They're...

1047
01:08:12,204 --> 01:08:14,263
gonna hang him in the morning.

1048
01:08:14,406 --> 01:08:16,135
-But they can't! I seen it!
-That's what I want...

1049
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,438
you to tell the governor!

1050
01:08:18,577 --> 01:08:20,875
No, I got souls to save.

1051
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,140
No, you got a life to save, and the
Lord don't care which one...

1052
01:08:22,214 --> 01:08:25,047
of your jobs you do first.

1053
01:08:25,151 --> 01:08:27,346
Keep a-goin', Fleety Belle!

1054
01:08:27,453 --> 01:08:30,980
Can I get you a drink of water
or somethin', Mr. Moses?

1055
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:35,049
Just lucky he didn't
bump his head on that boat.

1056
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,560
Hallelujah!

1057
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:48,401
Glory, be, Brother Efe!
Hallelujah!

1058
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:52,443
Into the fiery furnace! Into the
fiery furnace!

1059
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,514
-Glory be!
-Hallelujah!

1060
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:58,446
Glory be, brother!

1061
01:09:07,793 --> 01:09:10,523
Come!
We must have more wood!

1062
01:09:10,629 --> 01:09:14,588
Chop up the decks here! Chop
everything that burns!

1063
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,931
Every-
Anything that burns!

1064
01:09:18,037 --> 01:09:20,597
Must have more wood!

1065
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:26,271
Say, look here, honey.

1066
01:09:26,378 --> 01:09:28,141
Can you get over there and get
right in behind him?

1067
01:09:28,214 --> 01:09:30,705
Sure, I can. Yeah.

1068
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:33,046
-In his backwash?
-Uh-huh.

1069
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:36,952
Because if you can, the Lord has
given me an idea.

1070
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:42,455
Here she comes!

1071
01:10:02,147 --> 01:10:04,172
Mink, when I get sound asleep,
take this here...

1072
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,810
cigar out of my mouth, will ya?

1073
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:09,786
Burnt up three, four steamboats
that-a-way.

1074
01:10:44,056 --> 01:10:46,422
-Mornin', Mink.
-Morning, Captain.

1075
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:56,964
Mornin', Captain Eli! Have
a good night?

1076
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,631
Holy jumpin' catfish!

1077
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,401
Fletch! Fletch! Get an ax!

1078
01:11:05,544 --> 01:11:08,707
Get an ax and chop that old
scow loose!

1079
01:11:08,814 --> 01:11:12,773
Doc, you connivin' old scoundrel!

1080
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:16,309
It 'taint fair! It 'taint fair!

1081
01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:19,983
I’m just as sore 'bout it as you
are, Captain Eli...

1082
01:11:20,059 --> 01:11:24,428
when I found out we'd been
pushin' you all night.

1083
01:11:32,571 --> 01:11:35,540
Ah, son...

1084
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:39,042
I wouldn't keep watching that
scaffold if I were you.

1085
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:41,738
I ain't seen it, Reverend.

1086
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,440
I was watchin' up the river.

1087
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,509
I sure thought Uncle John and Fleety
Belle would be here today.

1088
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:52,648
Well, maybe they'll be able
to get here yet.

1089
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:54,952
I’ll stay here with you.

1090
01:11:55,094 --> 01:11:58,825
-How much time I got?
-Oh, a couple of hours.

1091
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:02,799
-Let me read to you a little.
-Please.

1092
01:12:04,536 --> 01:12:07,801
The fire's dyin' out, Doc. The
boiler's gettin' cold.

1093
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:11,171
She ain't got another lick in 'er.
We're sure licked now.

1094
01:12:11,276 --> 01:12:14,837
-You got to keep the fires goin'.
-Ain't got nothin' else to burn!

1095
01:12:14,947 --> 01:12:17,211
-Well, burn that museum!
-Huh?

1096
01:12:17,316 --> 01:12:19,216
Right!

1097
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:25,484
Moses!
Doc said burn up the museum!

1098
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,559
The mu-Good idea!

1099
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:31,288
You gon' burn up Mr. George
Washington? Hey!

1100
01:12:31,397 --> 01:12:33,865
I wonder how come they can...

1101
01:12:33,966 --> 01:12:36,400
In!

1102
01:12:39,138 --> 01:12:44,735
Mr. Moses, that's Miss Carry,
'Notion'; Lookee here-Hey!

1103
01:12:44,877 --> 01:12:49,211
Hey, Mr. Efe!
Mr. Efe! Hey!

1104
01:12:49,314 --> 01:12:51,544
It’s me, Mr. Efe! Hey! It’s me!

1105
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:54,619
It’s me! It’s Jonah, Mr. Efe!

1106
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,087
Go on, brother!

1107
01:12:59,191 --> 01:13:01,455
-Hallelujah!
-Go on, brother!

1108
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,790
Glory be! Hallelujah!

1109
01:13:03,896 --> 01:13:05,193
-Get everything in there!
-Get that drinkin'...

1110
01:13:05,264 --> 01:13:07,960
chap over there!

1111
01:13:08,067 --> 01:13:10,228
In with the demon rum!

1112
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:13,133
In he goes! Here we are!

1113
01:13:17,376 --> 01:13:20,345
Cramp her, Mink! Get in that
current and cramp her sharp!

1114
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:26,415
Hey, Clem!

1115
01:13:26,518 --> 01:13:28,679
Give 'er everything you've got!

1116
01:13:28,787 --> 01:13:32,985
Spread 'er wide open and put two
more men on the safety valve!

1117
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,231
Mr. Efe, there they is there!
Hurry up, Uncle Jeff!.

1118
01:13:45,304 --> 01:13:48,239
They sneakin' by!

1119
01:13:48,373 --> 01:13:52,469
-Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah!
-Glory be!

1120
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:59,314
-Only six to do now!
-Glory be!

1121
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:03,115
Come on, brother! Into the
fiery furnace!

1122
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:06,191
There they come, Mr. Efe! You
better make a fire up!

1123
01:14:06,258 --> 01:14:09,091
You better make it hotter!

1124
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:12,686
You just takin' your time!
You can't get no steam!

1125
01:14:12,798 --> 01:14:15,198
There they go! I know good
and well we...

1126
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:17,292
gon' have to catch 'em again!

1127
01:14:26,945 --> 01:14:28,913
-Take 'er, Mink.
-I’ve got 'er.

1128
01:14:31,683 --> 01:14:35,949
Hot ziggety! We got him beat
four ways to Sunday now!

1129
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:38,716
Glory be! Hold 'er steady, Mink!

1130
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:42,219
Ain't there somethin' we can get
in there and...

1131
01:14:42,294 --> 01:14:44,728
keep 'er goin' a little further?

1132
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:46,229
-We're purt' near there.
-We ain't got steam...

1133
01:14:46,298 --> 01:14:48,858
enough to raise a blister.

1134
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:51,231
Don't seem fair. They're gonna
hang Duke, and we...

1135
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:53,669
in spittin' distance of Baton Rouge.

1136
01:14:53,805 --> 01:14:56,831
Nothing can save us now but the
power of prayer.

1137
01:14:56,975 --> 01:14:59,341
Hey! What are you drinkin' there?

1138
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,777
Medicine.

1139
01:15:01,847 --> 01:15:06,113
Brother Efe, you've been deceivin'
me! That's demon rum!

1140
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:14,021
Hey, that's Pocahontas. It’s never
failed us yet.

1141
01:15:14,126 --> 01:15:17,186
-Say, we got 10 gallons, right?
-Ten? We got a hundred!

1142
01:15:17,296 --> 01:15:21,494
Then fire it up! Down with
demon rum!

1143
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,966
Down with demon rum!
Down with it!

1144
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:28,497
Down with the demon rum!
Into the fiery-

1145
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,941
Hallelujah!

1146
01:15:33,045 --> 01:15:35,570
Hallelujah!

1147
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:38,081
Boy, that stuff is dangerous!

1148
01:15:59,204 --> 01:16:02,037
-Give it here!
-Keep it goin'!

1149
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,541
Down with the demon rum!

1150
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:10,707
There we are! Into the fiery
furnace!

1151
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,216
-Glory, be!
-I’d love to see ol'...

1152
01:16:13,285 --> 01:16:15,219
Captain Eli's face now!

1153
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:22,119
Gosh almighty! Say, look, Mink!

1154
01:16:22,227 --> 01:16:24,923
Look at the way the smoke's
comin' out of'er!

1155
01:16:27,866 --> 01:16:30,426
Hey, Clem! Clem!

1156
01:16:30,535 --> 01:16:32,730
Feed 'er rosin!

1157
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:36,103
Yes, and a barrel of pitch!

1158
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:38,232
We'd better get hotter! I ain't
gonna rest,...

1159
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:41,609
so we'd better catch that-

1160
01:16:41,713 --> 01:16:43,977
Hallelujah!

1161
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:45,242
That must be some powerful
roots and herbs...

1162
01:16:45,317 --> 01:16:49,048
in this Pocahontas.

1163
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:57,183
Yea, brother! More! More!

1164
01:16:57,296 --> 01:17:02,632
Hurl away the demons!
Yes! There they are!

1165
01:17:02,734 --> 01:17:06,864
Hurl away the demons!
That's it!

1166
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,741
Mink, he's crawlin' up.

1167
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:36,261
We're comin' into... We're comin'
into Baton Rouge!

1168
01:17:36,368 --> 01:17:39,667
That's Baton Rouge!

1169
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:43,835
O God in heaven, look down upon
this, thy son...

1170
01:17:43,975 --> 01:17:46,466
Excuse me, Reverend.

1171
01:17:46,611 --> 01:17:50,672
Say, Duke, is there any last
request you'd like to make?

1172
01:17:50,782 --> 01:17:54,411
I sure would like to see the
finish of that race.

1173
01:17:54,519 --> 01:17:56,248
Well, I ain't got no objection to
that. But Rufe...

1174
01:17:56,321 --> 01:17:57,982
told me that you-

1175
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:01,582
That's all right. Anything Duke
wants suits me.

1176
01:18:01,693 --> 01:18:04,685
Well, I’d like to see the finish
of that race myself.

1177
01:18:04,796 --> 01:18:07,196
So, we'll let 'er go as soon as
the Pride of Paducah...

1178
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:09,790
comes around the bend.

1179
01:18:09,901 --> 01:18:12,699
-Thank you, sir.
-It won't be long.

1180
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,742
-There she comes!

1181
01:18:23,148 --> 01:18:26,015
Well, all right, son.
Let's go.

1182
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,678
Wait a minute! That ain't the
Pride of Paducah!

1183
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:31,415
It’s the Claremore Queen!

1184
01:19:56,775 --> 01:19:59,335
-Well, let's go.
-Good-bye, Duke.

1185
01:19:59,478 --> 01:20:02,777
<i>O Father, Father, I beseech thee...</i>

1186
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,975
<i>at this moment look down</i>
<i>upon thy son...</i>

1187
01:20:06,084 --> 01:20:08,052
<i>in this, his hour of need.</i>

1188
01:20:08,153 --> 01:20:09,245
<i>Grant him strength. Grant</i>
<i>him praise...</i>

1189
01:20:09,321 --> 01:20:11,186
<i>Wait! Wait! Wait!</i>

1190
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:14,486
<i>Wait! Wait! Wait!</i>

1191
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:17,561
I pardon this boy!

1192
