1
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,040
OK... Here we go. Focus.

2
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,360
Speed. I am speed.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,600
One winner, 42 losers.

4
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,120
I eat losers for breakfast.

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
Breakfast.

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,240
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,600
I am lightning!

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,880
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,520
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

12
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Ka-chow!

13
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Get your antenna balls here!

14
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,800
Go, Lightnin'!

15
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,720
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick.

16
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,600
Uh!

17
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

18
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,920
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,840
<i>We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.</i>

20
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,880
<i>Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.</i>

21
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,400
<i>If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>

22
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
<i>Right, Darrell.</i>

23
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,080
<i>Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,</i>

24
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
<i>heading into the final race
of the season.</i>

25
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,800
<i>And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>

26
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,480
<i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>

27
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,880
<i>have one more victory in him
before retirement?</i>

28
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,440
<i>He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!</i>

29
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,600
<i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>

30
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,880
<i>And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>

31
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,400
<i>He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.</i>

32
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,520
<i>Chick thought
this was his year.</i>

33
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,240
<i>His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.</i>

34
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,240
<i>But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!</i>

35
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,800
<i>You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.</i>

36
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,400
<i>The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.</i>

37
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,920
<i>But everyone knows him now.</i>

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,880
<i>Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,440
<i>The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!</i>

40
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,240
<i>Three cars, one champion!</i>

41
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,360
No you don't.

42
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
Hey!

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
What a ride!

44
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,840
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

45
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,280
I love you, Lightning!

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
Dinoco is all mine.

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
Trouble, turn three!

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,960
- Get through that, McQueen.
- Huge crash behind the leaders!

49
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,720
Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

50
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,520
There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

51
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,760
Not in one piece, that is.

52
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,400
Yeah!

53
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,360
Lightning! Oh!

54
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,560
Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

56
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah! Ka-chow!

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

58
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,200
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

59
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,400
While everyone
heads into the pits,

60
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,160
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

61
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,120
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

62
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,040
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

63
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,960
- McQueen made it!
- What?

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
He's not pitting!

65
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,120
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

66
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,880
McQueen's not going into the pits!

67
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,360
The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

68
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,640
- Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

69
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,840
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

70
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

71
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,520
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

72
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,680
Come on, come on, come on!

73
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,760
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

74
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,400
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- What?

75
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
You need tires, you idiot!

76
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,680
Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

77
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,120
Right. No tires again.

78
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,760
That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

79
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,360
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

80
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,200
This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

81
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,000
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

82
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,280
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

83
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,640
Checkered flag, here I come!

84
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,600
No! McQueen's blown a tire!

85
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,320
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

86
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,840
You fool!

87
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,520
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

88
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Go, go, go!

89
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,480
He's lost another tire!

90
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,640
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!

91
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,520
Come on.

92
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,440
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

93
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,920
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

94
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,920
The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

95
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,800
Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

96
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,560
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,920
Lightning!

98
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,080
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

99
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,480
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

100
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,480
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

101
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

102
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,840
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

103
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,320
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.</i>

104
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,760
<i>McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.</i>

105
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,760
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

106
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,400
<i>Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?</i>

107
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,760
<i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.</i>

108
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,560
<i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

109
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
<i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>

110
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,600
<i>- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>

111
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,760
<i>No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>

112
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
<i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>

113
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
<i>That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.</i>

114
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,840
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

115
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,520
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

116
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,200
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

117
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,200
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

118
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,720
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

119
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,680
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

120
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,400
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

121
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,080
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

122
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,920
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
Oh, whatever.

124
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,600
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

125
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,840
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

126
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,040
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

127
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,560
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

128
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,160
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

129
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,640
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

130
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
In your dreams, Thunder.

131
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,480
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

132
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,280
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

133
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,080
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

134
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,480
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

135
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,160
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

136
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,640
Right in the lens.

137
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

138
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,120
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

139
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,480
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

140
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,480
Thank you, King.

141
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,240
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

142
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,600
It's the least I could do.

143
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,760
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

144
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,520
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

145
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,200
Kch-i-ka-chow!

146
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,840
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

147
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,040
We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

148
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,480
I love being me.

149
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,560
- OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

150
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

151
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,720
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

152
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,520
You got more talent in one lug nut

153
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,040
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

154
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,600
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

155
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,120
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

156
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,160
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

157
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

158
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,360
and you let them
do their job, like they should.

159
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,080
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

160
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,960
Yeah...

161
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,880
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

162
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,760
Oh, Lightning!

163
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,880
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

164
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,440
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

165
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,880
Thank you, Mr. The King.

166
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

167
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

168
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,760
A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

169
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Yes!

170
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,040
...we have a three-way tie.

171
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,360
Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

172
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

173
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,280
Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

174
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,400
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

175
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,760
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

176
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,400
Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

177
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

178
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,520
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

179
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
Yep! All right! Got it!

180
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,000
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself. "

181
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,600
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

182
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,720
Huh?

183
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,960
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

184
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,800
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

185
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,960
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

186
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,960
Gotta make your personal appearance.

187
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,480
No. No! No, no, no, no!

188
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
<i>Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.</i>

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,480
<i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>

190
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,080
<i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.</i>

191
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,800
<i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>

192
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,440
<i>Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!</i>

193
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,720
<i>Ka-chow!</i>

194
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
I met this car from Swampscott.

195
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,800
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

196
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,600
You could see his dirty undercarriage.

197
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,720
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

198
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,080
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

199
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,760
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

201
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,200
But remember,
all that salt and grime...

202
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,160
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

203
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,080
Hey, look! There he is!

204
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,040
Our almost champ!

205
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,720
Get your rear end in here.

206
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,720
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

207
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,880
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

208
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

209
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,720
Yes, I know.

210
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,280
"Fred. " Fred, thank you.

211
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,840
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

212
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,800
Looking good, Freddie!

213
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,240
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

214
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,720
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

215
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,760
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

216
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,080
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

217
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

218
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,000
because the track is always lit.

219
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,120
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

220
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,440
- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Lightning McQueen!

221
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,160
Free Bird!

222
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,400
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

223
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,280
ran a great race today.

224
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,880
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

225
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,080
And an insane
amount of luck,

226
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,480
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

227
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,440
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

228
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,840
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

229
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,160
Just like this year!

230
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,880
Not on your life.

231
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,520
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

232
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,480
<i>California, here we come!</i>

233
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,120
Dinoco, here we come!

234
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,200
Oh... oh... uh,
I needed this. Hello?

235
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,720
<i>Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?</i>

236
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,840
Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?

237
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,560
<i>And it is such an honor
to be your agent</i>

238
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,520
<i>that it almost hurts me to take
ten percent of your winnings.</i>

239
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,520
<i>Merchandising. And ancillary rights in
perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!</i>

240
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,960
<i>I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.</i>

241
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,120
Thanks, Harv.

242
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,720
<i>Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.</i>

243
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,360
<i>I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.</i>

244
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,440
<i>- You let Harv rock it for you, baby.
- Right. Friends.</i>

245
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
Yes, there's...

246
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,760
<i>OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.</i>

247
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
<i>So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,</i>

248
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,960
<i>you better make time
for your best friend!</i>

249
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,120
<i>Break bread
with your mishpocheh here!</i>

250
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
That'd be great!
We should totally...

251
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
<i>OK, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.</i>

252
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,960
What? A minivan?

253
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,640
<i>Come on, you're in the slow lane.</i>

254
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,960
<i>This is Lightning McQueen
you're hauling here.</i>

255
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,440
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.

256
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,840
<i>- Old Mack needs a rest.
- Absolutely not.</i>

257
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,480
<i>We're driving all night till we
get to California. We agreed to it.</i>

258
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,600
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...

259
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,600
<i>Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.</i>

260
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
All those sleeping trucks.

261
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,360
<i>Hey, kid,
I don't know if I can make it.</i>

262
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,800
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

263
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,120
Look, it'll be easy.
I'll stay up with you.

264
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,920
<i>- All night?
- All night long.</i>

265
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,520
Uh!

266
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,280
Ah-choo!

267
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,720
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?

268
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,680
We got ourselves a nodder.

269
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,160
Pretty music.

270
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,480
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

271
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,960
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!

272
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,000
- Oops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?

273
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,840
- Oh, no, Snot Rod...
- He's gonna blow!

274
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,600
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

275
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,920
Gesundheit!

276
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,920
One should never drive while drowsy.

277
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Uh! Ah!

278
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,040
Mack!

279
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,000
Mack!

280
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Mack!

281
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,680
Hey, Mack! Mack!

282
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,200
Mack!

283
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,680
Mack, wait for me!

284
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,120
Mack!

285
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Mack! Mack!

286
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,280
Mack! Mack...

287
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,720
...wait up! Mack.

288
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,600
Mack! Mack!

289
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,760
What? You're not Mack.

290
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,400
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

291
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,280
Turn on your lights, you moron!

292
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
Mack... The Interstate!

293
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,080
Huh?

294
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,880
Not in my town, you don't.

295
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,720
Oh, no.

296
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,240
Oh, maybe he can help me!

297
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,520
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

298
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,800
I haven't gone this fast in years.

299
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,600
I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.

300
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,880
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

301
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,600
What in the blue blazes?

302
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,120
Crazy hot-rodder.

303
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,040
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.

304
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,920
The sixties weren't good to you,
were they?

305
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,000
What? That's not the Interstate!

306
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,880
Ah! Oh!

307
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,080
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

308
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,320
No, no, no, no, no, no!

309
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,720
Ow!

310
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,720
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

311
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,800
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.

312
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,120
- No!
- Hey!

313
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

314
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,520
My tires!

315
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,400
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

316
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,960
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

317
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,880
<i>We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway</i>

318
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,360
<i>as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,</i>

319
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,640
<i>is arriving at the track.</i>

320
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,560
<i>Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?</i>

321
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,760
<i>What's your strategy?</i>

322
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,320
<i>What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?</i>

323
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,000
<i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.</i>

324
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,880
<i>- McQueen was reported missing.
- ... to race an unprecedented...</i>

325
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,400
<i>Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.</i>

326
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,560
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

327
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,680
<i>I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>

328
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,720
<i>Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!</i>

329
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,600
<i>They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?</i>

330
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh, boy.

331
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,600
Where am I?

332
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,160
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!

333
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,240
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

334
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,880
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

335
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,760
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

336
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,560
- What's going on here? Please!
- You're funny.

337
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,560
I like you already. My name's Mater.

338
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,960
Mater?

339
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,880
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

340
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,080
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

341
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,080
Uh...

342
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,400
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

343
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
What?

344
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,120
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

345
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,360
Where are you? Shoot!

346
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,920
You're in Radiator Springs.

347
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,240
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

348
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,080
Oh, great. Just great!

349
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,480
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

350
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,200
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

351
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,120
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

352
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,800
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

353
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,000
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

354
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,520
- Cool!
- Mater!

355
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,360
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

356
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,840
To not to.

357
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,160
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

358
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

359
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,080
"Later, Mater. "
That's funny!

360
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,280
Ah!

361
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,920
The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

362
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,360
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

363
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,720
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

364
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,760
- Fascist!
- Commie!

365
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,440
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

366
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,200
I gotta get to California, pronto.

367
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,400
Where's your lawyer?

368
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,600
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

369
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,560
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

370
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,560
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

371
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,120
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

372
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,800
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

373
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,200
Show-off.

374
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,480
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

375
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,680
All right,

376
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

377
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,640
I want his hood on a platter!

378
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,280
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

379
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,960
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

380
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,520
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

381
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,040
I'm...

382
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,800
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

383
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,120
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

384
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,760
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

385
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,000
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

386
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,480
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

387
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,320
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

388
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,760
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

389
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,160
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

390
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,080
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

391
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,160
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

392
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,640
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

393
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,600
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

394
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,600
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

395
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,120
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

396
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,800
Agh! Ow!

397
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,160
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

398
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,160
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

399
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,880
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

400
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,400
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

401
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,040
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

402
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,040
Ka-ching!

403
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120
Ah!

404
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,120
I'll keep that in mind.

405
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,600
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

406
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,160
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

407
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,800
You know her?

408
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,720
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

409
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,760
What?

410
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,760
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

411
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,480
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

412
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,160
What do you want, Sally?

413
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,440
Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

414
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,560
No. I know his type. Racecar.

415
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,600
That's the last thing this town needs.

416
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,000
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

417
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,840
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

418
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,280
Here she goes again.

419
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,920
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

420
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,480
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

421
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,200
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

422
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,120
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

423
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,320
Ignore him.

424
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,600
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

425
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,920
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

426
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,680
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

427
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,160
And if no one can get to you?

428
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,400
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

429
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,200
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

430
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,520
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

431
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,960
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

432
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,400
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

433
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,440
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

434
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,000
- Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

435
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,760
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

436
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,960
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

437
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,160
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

438
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,160
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

439
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,200
Oh, he can do it.

440
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,960
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

441
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,400
Fix the road!

442
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,880
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

443
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,320
Order in the court!

444
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,720
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

445
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,680
- Yeah!
- No!

446
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,040
Nice ruling.

447
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,080
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

448
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,880
That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

449
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,720
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

450
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,280
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

451
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,920
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

452
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,840
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

453
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,840
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

454
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,520
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

455
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,840
What? This place is crazy!

456
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,000
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

457
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,920
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

458
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,960
What?

459
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,440
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

460
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,040
You gotta be kidding me.

461
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,680
You start there where the road begins.

462
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,880
You finish down there
where the road ends.

463
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,960
Holy shoot!

464
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

465
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,240
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

466
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,440
Five days?

467
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,320
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

468
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,240
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

469
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,680
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

470
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,600
Freedom!

471
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,080
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

472
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,960
...and then...
then took the boot off.

473
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,680
Whoo-hoo!

474
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,240
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

475
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,000
California, here I come! Yeah!

476
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,200
Oh, feel that wind.

477
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,160
Yes!

478
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,200
No. No, no, no.

479
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,720
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

480
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,680
How can I be outta gas?

481
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,560
Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

482
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,880
But how did,
how did... you...?

483
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,200
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

484
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,040
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

485
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,400
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

486
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,520
Hey, Sheriff.

487
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,760
<i>- Why here?
- Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

488
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,200
<i>- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

489
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,080
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

490
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,880
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

491
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,640
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

492
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,320
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

493
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,200
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

494
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,480
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

495
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,680
That's why we made him the judge.

496
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,840
<i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

497
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,240
Now, I'm not one to brag

498
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,440
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

499
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,880
Oh!

500
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,680
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

501
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,480
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

502
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,720
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

503
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,280
No, no, no!

504
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,600
That won't be necessary.

505
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,800
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

506
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,360
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

507
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,680
Where's he goin'?

508
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,040
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

509
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,560
I shouldn't put up with this.

510
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,400
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

511
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,360
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

512
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,680
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

513
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,280
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

514
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,160
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

515
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,440
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

516
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

517
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,520
I must scream it to the world!

518
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,640
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

519
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,120
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

520
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,040
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

521
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,560
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

522
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,720
Is that what I think it is?

523
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,440
Customers.

524
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,800
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

525
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,200
- OK!
- Customers?

526
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,000
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

527
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

528
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,960
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

529
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,600
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

530
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,880
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

531
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,520
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

532
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,400
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

533
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,640
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

534
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
How can we help you?

535
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,680
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

536
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,840
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

537
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,240
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

538
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,040
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

539
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,040
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

540
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,000
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

541
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,720
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

542
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,840
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

543
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,120
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

544
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,400
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

545
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,720
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

546
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,800
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

547
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,480
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

548
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,840
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

549
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,680
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

550
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,880
No we just topped off.

551
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,640
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

552
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,080
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

553
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,360
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

554
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,440
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

555
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,720
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

556
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,080
Maybe ghost flames!

557
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,600
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

558
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,400
Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

559
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,360
OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

560
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
Ow!

561
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,040
A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

562
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

563
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,680
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

564
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,200
OK! Yes. You bet.

565
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

566
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,480
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

567
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

568
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,240
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

569
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,720
No, not really. But listen.

570
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,280
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

571
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,760
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

572
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,520
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

573
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,640
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

574
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,400
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

575
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,520
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

576
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
I'm becoming one of them!

577
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,440
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

578
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,200
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

579
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,000
<i>We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

580
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,680
<i>- That's good.
- ... after a Piston Cup update.</i>

581
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,480
<i>Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

582
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,880
<i>and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.</i>

583
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,000
<i>It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.</i>

584
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,680
<i>You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.</i>

585
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,680
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

586
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,520
Ha-ha!

587
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,160
Yeah!

588
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,520
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

589
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,760
Oh!

590
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,120
Let me get this straight.

591
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,000
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

592
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,640
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

593
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,760
I got a road to finish.

594
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,440
- He's done!
- Done?

595
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,760
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

596
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,840
Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

597
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,640
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

598
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,720
Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

599
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,800
Oh!

600
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,680
It rides purty smooth.

601
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,240
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

602
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,680
Oh!

603
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,960
Red.

604
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,760
Who do you think you are?

605
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,960
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

606
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,320
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

607
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,760
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

608
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,320
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

609
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,800
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

610
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,960
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

611
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,680
- What?
- Me and you. That a joke?

612
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,000
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

613
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,640
If I win, you do the road my way.

614
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,200
Doc, what're you doin'?

615
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,320
I don't mean to be rude here,

616
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,960
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

617
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,440
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

618
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,000
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

619
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,080
Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

620
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,480
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

621
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,360
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

622
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,840
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

623
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,840
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

624
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,600
and no lollygaggin'.

625
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,160
Speed. I'm speed.

626
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,680
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

627
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,480
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

628
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,960
- Peet stop!
- Uh...

629
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,800
The race is only one lap, guys.

630
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,240
<i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>

631
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,000
<i>- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.</i>

632
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,960
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

633
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,960
Gentlemen...

634
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,320
...start your engines!

635
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,080
<i>- Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.</i>

636
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,120
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

637
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,720
Luigi?

638
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,840
On your mark, get set...

639
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,080
<i>Uno for the money,
due for the show,</i>

640
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,600
<i>tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>

641
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,000
Huh?

642
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,040
Doc... the flag means go.

643
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,320
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

644
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,000
Doc, what are you doing, man?

645
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,480
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

646
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,560
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

647
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,280
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

648
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,280
You got your tow cable?

649
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,480
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

650
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,720
Oh, just in case.

651
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,040
Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

652
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,760
No, no, no, no, no!

653
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,200
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

654
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,120
- Ow!
- Bad trip, man.

655
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,920
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

656
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm confused.

657
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
You drive like you fix roads.

658
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,480
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

659
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,880
Ah!

660
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

661
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,480
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

662
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,320
I can make a little turn on dirt.

663
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,760
You think?

664
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,120
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

665
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,560
<i>Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!</i>

666
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,480
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

667
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,800
- That freak juice?
- Pass.

668
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,160
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

669
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,760
Nah, not me, Flo.

670
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm on one of them there special diets.

671
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,640
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

672
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,400
"You race like you fix roads. "

673
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,040
I'll show him.
I will show him!

674
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,200
Oh, great! I hate it!

675
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,720
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- Music. Sweet music.

676
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,360
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

677
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,040
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

678
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,000
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

679
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,080
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

680
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,640
Wow.

681
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,600
Mornin', Sally!

682
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

683
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,640
Yes! Uh, amazing!

684
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,600
Whoa-ho! Yeah!

685
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,680
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

686
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,200
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

687
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,240
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

688
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,440
<i>E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>

689
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,080
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

690
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,200
Boy, I tell you what.

691
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,000
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

692
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,680
Doc, look at this!

693
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,560
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

694
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,960
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

695
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,880
Guido, look at Luigi!

696
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,120
<i>This is fantastico!</i>

697
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,520
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

698
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,720
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

699
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,920
That crazy old devil woman.

700
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,640
Oh!

701
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,480
She's right!

702
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,040
- Ah!
- Guido!

703
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,720
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

704
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,600
Well, now... where the heck is he?

705
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,280
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

706
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,600
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

707
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,920
and asked me if he could
come down here.

708
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,280
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

709
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,080
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

710
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,960
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

711
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,880
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

712
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,280
I'll keep an eye on him.

713
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,080
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

714
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,240
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

715
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,920
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

716
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,200
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

717
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,600
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

718
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,640
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

719
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,680
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

720
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,320
I'll put it simple.

721
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,400
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

722
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,600
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

723
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,400
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

724
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,920
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

725
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,880
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

726
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,040
Turn right to go left.

727
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,200
Hmm...

728
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,280
Whoa!

729
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,920
Oh!

730
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,160
Ow! Oh, that...

731
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,920
Ow!

732
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,440
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

733
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,480
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

734
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,800
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

735
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,640
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

736
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,640
<i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?</i>

737
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,920
<i>- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

738
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,320
Oh, Lord.

739
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,960
Mater!

740
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,080
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

741
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,320
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

742
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,120
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

743
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,560
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

744
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,200
Oh...

745
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,840
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

746
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,360
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

747
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,560
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

748
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,840
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

749
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,840
You make-a such a nice new road.

750
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,480
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

751
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,080
Even though you not a Ferrari.

752
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,080
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

753
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,840
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

754
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,280
I like your style, eh?

755
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,800
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

756
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,160
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

757
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,840
Oh, would you look at that?

758
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,960
Ramone, Ramone!

759
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

760
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,960
No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

761
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,520
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

762
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,120
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

763
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,920
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

764
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,400
Ah!

765
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,480
Stop! Let me...

766
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,560
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

767
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,560
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

768
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,840
Stop, stop! That's cold!

769
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,320
Help! Please! Stop!

770
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,600
Thanks, Red.

771
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,000
What was that for?

772
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,120
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

773
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,600
If you do, you gotta be clean.

774
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,120
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

775
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,840
What, I...? I don't get it.

776
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,400
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

777
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,560
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

778
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,080
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

779
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,880
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

780
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,240
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

781
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,440
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

782
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,560
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- It's newly refurbished.

783
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,960
Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

784
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,000
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

785
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,280
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

786
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,880
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

787
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,160
Cone number one, if you want.

788
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,480
Oh...

789
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,160
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

790
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,200
Oh...
That's just a... Oh!

791
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,880
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

792
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,440
Gonna... Yeah.

793
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,480
You know, I knew this girl Doreen.

794
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,000
Good-lookin' girl.

795
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,240
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

796
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,640
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

797
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,080
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

798
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,120
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

799
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,200
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

800
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,680
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

801
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,960
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

802
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,720
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

803
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,640
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

804
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,960
I can handle anything.

805
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,640
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it!

806
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,280
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.

807
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,720
All right, listen.

808
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,600
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

809
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,440
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

810
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,280
Mater!

811
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,720
Wait, Mater!

812
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,720
OK, here's what you do.

813
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,040
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

814
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,520
And they do the rest. Watch this.

815
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,040
Oh!

816
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Oh... Oh! Oh...

817
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,720
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

818
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,440
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

819
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,000
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

820
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,320
Oh!

821
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,840
Oh! Oh...

822
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,600
I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

823
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,360
Oh, your turn, bud.

824
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,720
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

825
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,960
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

826
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,280
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

827
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,480
That's Frank.

828
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,800
Run!

829
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,760
Here he comes, look out!

830
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,320
Whoa!

831
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,040
Run! He's gonna get ya!

832
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,640
Oh! Customers!

833
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,240
Oh!

834
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,520
Ah, no, no, no.

835
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,240
Oof! Oh!

836
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,480
Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

837
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,920
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

838
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,120
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

839
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,040
Oh, yeah... yeah.

840
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,080
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

841
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,200
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

842
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,240
Oh...

843
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:57,360
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

844
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,520
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

845
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,320
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

846
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,000
Where, where?

847
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,560
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

848
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,720
- Yes, you do.
- No way.

849
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,920
- Way.
- Come on, look...

850
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,320
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

851
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,960
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

852
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,800
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

853
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,840
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

854
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,360
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

855
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,360
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

856
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,600
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

857
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,360
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

858
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,440
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

859
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,040
What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

860
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,440
Mater? Mater!

861
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,000
Mater!

862
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,040
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

863
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,520
Oof!

864
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,880
Yee-hee!

865
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,120
He's nuts.

866
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,480
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

867
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,840
Just need to know where I've been.

868
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,920
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

869
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,800
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

870
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

871
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,440
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

872
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,480
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

873
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,760
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

874
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,760
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

875
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,240
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

876
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,920
with private helicopters.

877
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,120
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

878
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,200
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

879
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,440
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

880
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,520
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

881
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,360
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

882
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,840
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

883
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,600
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

884
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,360
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

885
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,240
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

886
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,040
In what?

887
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,800
My best friend.

888
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,600
See you tomorrow, buddy!

889
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,000
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,</i>

890
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,600
<i>K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!</i>

891
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

892
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,800
Number one. Number one...
Ah, number one!

893
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,120
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

894
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,160
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

895
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,280
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

896
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,320
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

897
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,000
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

898
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,720
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

899
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,680
Something about a helicopter ride.

900
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

901
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,680
- Did you mean it?
- What?

902
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,680
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

903
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,680
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

904
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,640
Uh-huh.

905
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,800
You know... Mater trusts you.

906
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,360
Yeah, OK.

907
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,040
- Did you mean that?
- What?

908
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:34,520
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

909
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,120
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

910
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,560
Yeah, OK. G'night.

911
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,000
Oh...

912
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,200
Hey, thank you.

913
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,000
What did you just say?

914
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,760
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

915
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,560
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

916
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,040
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

917
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,320
- G'night.
- Good night.

918
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,800
Hmm.

919
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,560
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?

920
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,320
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

921
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,320
Ah!

922
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,520
No!

923
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,640
No!

924
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,360
I gotta get outta here!

925
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,640
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

926
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,840
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

927
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,240
I just need my
daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

928
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,360
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

929
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,960
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

930
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,440
Hope you enjoyed the show!

931
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,200
Whoa, Doc.

932
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,840
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

933
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,800
What?

934
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,560
He has a Piston Cup?

935
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,040
Oh, my gosh.

936
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,280
Three Piston Cups?

937
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,000
Sign says stay out.

938
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,320
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

939
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,360
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

940
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,320
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

941
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,840
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

942
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,560
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

943
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,120
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

944
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,840
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

945
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,520
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

946
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,880
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

947
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,000
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

948
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,800
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

949
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,960
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

950
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,600
- Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

951
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,680
There he is.

952
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,640
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

953
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,400
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

954
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,960
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

955
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,200
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

956
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,440
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

957
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,480
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

958
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,000
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

959
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,760
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

960
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,080
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

961
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,160
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

962
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,560
I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

963
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,280
- Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

964
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,040
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

965
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,640
- Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me, right?

966
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,280
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

967
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,440
Hmm... I trust him.

968
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,560
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

969
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,880
Yeah, a drive.

970
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,920
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

971
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,600
Ah... No. No, we don't.

972
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,840
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

973
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,560
Mm-hm!

974
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,960
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

975
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,360
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

976
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,240
That's so too much!

977
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,560
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

978
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,520
I don't know.

979
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,120
Whoa! Yes.

980
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,840
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

981
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,400
Bleah!

982
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,720
Oh!

983
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,720
Wow. What is this place?

984
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,720
Wheel Well.

985
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,920
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

986
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,000
This place?

987
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,440
Yeah, imagine.

988
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,680
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

989
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,400
You know, I don't get you.

990
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,600
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

991
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,760
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

992
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,840
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

993
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,320
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

994
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,640
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

995
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,920
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

996
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,680
And you know what?

997
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,200
It never felt... happy.

998
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,760
Yeah. I mean... really?

999
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,480
Yeah. So I left California.

1000
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,720
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1001
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,120
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1002
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,040
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1003
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,920
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1004
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,680
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1005
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,320
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1006
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,600
I fell in love.

1007
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,160
- Oh.
- Yep.

1008
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,680
- Corvette?
- No.

1009
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,640
I fell in love with this.

1010
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,720
Whoa. Look at that.

1011
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,800
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1012
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,000
They don't even know
what they're missing!

1013
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,200
Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

1014
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,880
Oh, yeah?

1015
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,680
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1016
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,720
Really?

1017
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,400
Yeah. Back then,

1018
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,200
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

1019
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,720
How do you mean?

1020
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:05,040
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

1021
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,120
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

1022
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,480
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

1023
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,000
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

1024
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,520
They drove on it to have a great time.

1025
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,440
Well, what happened?

1026
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,840
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

1027
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,920
How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

1028
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,680
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

1029
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,240
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

1030
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,840
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1031
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,640
I had a great time.

1032
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,320
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

1033
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,040
You're welcome.

1034
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,320
Hey, listen, listen!

1035
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,360
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

1036
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,440
Wha... what?

1037
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,120
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

1038
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,080
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

1039
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,600
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

1040
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,880
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1041
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,840
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

1042
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,320
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

1043
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,280
There's one goin' this way.

1044
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,280
I got it.

1045
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,880
Come here, little tractor,
come here.

1046
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,120
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1047
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,480
No, no, no, no, come here.

1048
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,880
What are you doing?

1049
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,520
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

1050
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,080
...alone.

1051
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,080
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?

1052
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,720
Come on, Doc, drive.

1053
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,120
Ah... Yeah.

1054
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,760
- Wow.
- Huh?

1055
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,360
You're amazing!

1056
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,440
What are you doin'?

1057
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,120
Doc, wait!

1058
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,200
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

1059
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,040
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1060
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,280
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1061
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,120
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.

1062
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,040
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,

1063
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,040
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

1064
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,040
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1065
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,920
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1066
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,080
You think I quit?

1067
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,760
Right.

1068
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,920
Your big wreck in '54.

1069
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,840
They quit on me.

1070
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,320
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

1071
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,160
You know what they said?
"You're history. "

1072
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,160
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

1073
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,040
There was a lot left in me.

1074
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,600
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1075
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,920
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

1076
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,080
I just never expected that
that world would...

1077
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,240
...would find me here.

1078
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,800
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?

1079
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,840
No, I'm not.

1080
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,600
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

1081
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:17,040
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

1082
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,680
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

1083
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,720
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1084
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,320
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

1085
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,800
Oh, like you?
You've been here how long

1086
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,000
and your friends
don't even know who you are?

1087
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,640
Who's caring about only himself?

1088
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,400
Just finish that road
and get outta here!

1089
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,560
Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?

1090
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,960
Respect the classics, man.

1091
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,000
Ah...

1092
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,640
He's done.

1093
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,800
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin'.

1094
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,000
Good riddance.

1095
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,960
He's gone?

1096
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,920
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

1097
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:51,320
- Oh, dude, are you crying?
- No! I'm happy!

1098
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,200
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!

1099
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,440
I'm glad he's gone!

1100
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,480
What's wrong with Red?

1101
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,840
Oh, he's just sad
'cause you left town

1102
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,720
and went to your big race to win
the Piston Cup

1103
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,520
that you've always dreamed about
your whole life

1104
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,880
and get that big ol' sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1105
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,560
Wait a minute!

1106
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,600
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1107
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,280
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.

1108
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,880
Don't worry. I'll give you
a police escort, and we'll make up time.

1109
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,080
Thank you, Sheriff.

1110
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,160
But you know I can't go just yet.

1111
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,680
Well, why not?

1112
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,480
I'm not sure these tires...

1113
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,320
...can get me to California.
- Peet stop?

1114
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,520
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?

1115
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,880
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1116
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,640
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1117
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,320
<i>Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!</i>

1118
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:58,320
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!

1119
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,840
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1120
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,600
for this is the most glorious day
of my life!

1121
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,520
All right, Luigi, give me
the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1122
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,880
No! No, no, no.

1123
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,200
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.

1124
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,480
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.

1125
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,920
But-a this...

1126
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,000
Whitewall tires!

1127
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,000
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me. "

1128
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,800
All right, you're the expert.

1129
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,680
Don't forget the spare.

1130
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,480
<i>- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!</i>

1131
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,200
What did Luigi tell you, eh?

1132
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,560
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1133
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,440
Eh... No.

1134
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,600
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?

1135
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,600
It's a conspiracy, man!

1136
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,040
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

1137
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,200
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1138
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,280
OK, I'll take a case.

1139
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,160
Ow! Eh!

1140
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,200
Ah... Yeah.

1141
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,160
Ka-chow.

1142
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,840
- Here she comes!
- Places, everybody. Hurry!

1143
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,560
Act natural.

1144
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,920
<i>- Hi, Sally.
- Buon giorno!</i>

1145
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,760
All right, what's goin' on?

1146
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,880
Ladies and gentlecars,

1147
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,720
please welcome
the new Lightning McQueen!

1148
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,240
Pow! What do you think?

1149
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,440
Radiator Springs
looks pretty good on me.

1150
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,240
I'll say.

1151
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,360
Ka-chow.

1152
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,840
You're gonna fit right in
in California.

1153
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,680
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

1154
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,520
Yeah, everybody except one.

1155
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:17,520
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1156
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,480
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1157
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,640
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1158
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,360
They fixed their neon!

1159
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:00,240
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby!

1160
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,600
Just like in its heyday, right?

1161
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,880
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1162
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,560
Shall we cruise?

1163
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,880
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1164
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,360
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1165
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,560
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1166
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,400
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1167
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,680
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1168
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,080
...and again and I said, "No. "
He asked me again, and I said, "No. "

1169
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,320
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1170
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,640
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive. "

1171
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:15,600
Oh!

1172
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,800
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1173
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,080
Good evenin', you two.

1174
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:31,480
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1175
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,080
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1176
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:44,560
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1177
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,120
Not that. That.

1178
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:47,280
Customers?

1179
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,520
Customers?

1180
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,120
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1181
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,280
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1182
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,840
It's the ghostlight!

1183
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,400
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1184
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,680
McQueen, over here!

1185
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,360
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1186
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,480
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1187
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,160
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1188
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,200
Stickers!

1189
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,360
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1190
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,800
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1191
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,920
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1192
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,520
Sally! Sally!

1193
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,560
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1194
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,280
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1195
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,680
Come on, give us some bolt!

1196
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:31,040
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1197
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,360
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1198
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:38,120
You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1199
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,800
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1200
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,680
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1201
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,200
<i>Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?</i>

1202
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,720
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1203
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,080
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1204
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,280
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1205
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,520
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1206
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,360
- Harv?
- Come on!

1207
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,000
<i>- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?</i>

1208
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,640
<i>My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!</i>

1209
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,800
<i>- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.</i>

1210
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,120
<i>I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!</i>

1211
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,120
<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?</i>

1212
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,560
<i>That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.</i>

1213
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,840
<i>Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>

1214
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,320
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1215
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,440
<i>- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.</i>

1216
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,680
<i>Playtime is over, pal.</i>

1217
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,400
<i>While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.</i>

1218
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,120
<i>- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!</i>

1219
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:34,640
<i>Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.</i>

1220
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,800
<i>- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?</i>

1221
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,360
<i>You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!</i>

1222
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,560
<i>- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1223
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,440
<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

1224
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,200
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1225
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,960
<i>No, wait. Where are you goin'?</i>

1226
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,200
<i>Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?</i>

1227
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,840
Sally, I... I want you to...

1228
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,400
Look, I wish...

1229
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,600
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1230
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:15,640
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1231
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,720
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1232
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,880
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1233
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,600
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1234
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,800
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1235
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,960
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1236
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,040
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1237
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,240
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1238
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,320
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1239
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,560
<i>- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?</i>

1240
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,920
<i>- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!</i>

1241
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,560
<i>You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.</i>

1242
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,840
<i>You don't belong there, anyway.</i>

1243
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,760
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1244
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,600
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1245
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,720
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1246
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,080
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1247
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,800
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1248
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,400
Best for everyone or best for you?

1249
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,920
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1250
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,240
Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1251
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,520
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1252
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,720
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1253
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,160
There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1254
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,680
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1255
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:04,920
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1256
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,440
The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1257
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:10,680
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1258
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,840
I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1259
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,760
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1260
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,080
In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1261
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:24,080
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century. "

1262
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,640
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1263
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:30,640
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1264
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,680
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1265
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:34,720
He's hot!

1266
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,360
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1267
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,400
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1268
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,880
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1269
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,760
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1270
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,480
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1271
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,560
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1272
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:56,400
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1273
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,200
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1274
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,480
Sorry, pal.

1275
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:05,640
OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1276
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,040
I am speed.

1277
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:11,880
Victory.

1278
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,000
One winner, two losers.

1279
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,320
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1280
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,800
Lightnin'! You ready?

1281
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1282
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,000
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1283
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,560
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1284
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,920
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1285
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,240
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1286
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,160
Uh-oh

1287
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,440
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1288
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,760
And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1289
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,840
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1290
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,200
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1291
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,200
Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1292
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,280
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1293
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,800
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1294
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,640
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1295
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,560
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1296
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:51,680
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1297
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,240
Agh! Shoot!

1298
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,280
Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1299
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,800
Come on, you can do it!

1300
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,840
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1301
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,040
Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1302
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,240
McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1303
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,400
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1304
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,760
Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1305
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,480
He lost momentum,

1306
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,760
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1307
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,760
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1308
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,080
Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1309
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:51,520
McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1310
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:56,560
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1311
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,000
I don't think I...

1312
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,680
I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1313
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,360
Doc?

1314
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,440
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1315
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,120
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1316
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,040
You said you'd never come back.

1317
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:16,560
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1318
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,400
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1319
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,560
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1320
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,760
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1321
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,760
Now, get back out there!

1322
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:36,760
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1323
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,000
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1324
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,120
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1325
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,800
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1326
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:47,160
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1327
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,200
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1328
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,880
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1329
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,480
It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1330
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,840
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1331
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,480
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1332
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:14,760
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1333
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,160
<i>Wow, this is history
in the making.</i>

1334
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:24,000
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!</i>

1335
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,400
Hey, Doc!

1336
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:29,480
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1337
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,840
- McQueen passes on the inside!
- He's nearly a lap down.

1338
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,680
Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1339
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,520
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1340
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,120
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

1341
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,960
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1342
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,320
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1343
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,960
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

1344
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,040
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1345
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,600
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1346
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,320
What do you think of this?

1347
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,440
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1348
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,880
What?

1349
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,680
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1350
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:31,440
- I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1351
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,360
What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1352
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,200
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1353
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,280
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1354
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,840
Look at that boy go out there!

1355
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,520
Oh!

1356
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,920
No, you don't.

1357
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,800
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1358
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,160
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1359
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:07,400
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1360
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,280
We gotta get him
back out there fast

1361
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,200
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1362
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,320
Guido! It's time.

1363
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:23,400
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1364
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,520
I don't believe it!

1365
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,200
That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1366
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,720
It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1367
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,440
It's gonna be close.

1368
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,400
Yeah, baby!

1369
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,760
<i>He's back in!</i>

1370
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,000
Peet stop.

1371
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,240
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1372
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,840
This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1373
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,200
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1374
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,640
A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1375
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,920
This is it, kiddo.

1376
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,360
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1377
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,800
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1378
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,200
Go!

1379
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,880
We'll see about that!

1380
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,800
McQueen's going inside!

1381
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,560
- Chick and King are loose!
- I think McQueen's out!

1382
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,200
- McQueen saved it!
- He's back on the track!

1383
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,120
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1384
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:53,640
Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...

1385
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,000
Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1386
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,080
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1387
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:05,200
I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1388
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,920
Oh, no!

1389
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,800
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1390
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,440
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1391
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,760
What's he up to, Doc?

1392
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,000
What are you doin', kid?

1393
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:58,160
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1394
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,080
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1395
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:07,600
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1396
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,680
It's just an empty cup.

1397
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:14,160
Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1398
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:17,720
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1399
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,000
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1400
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,640
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1401
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,880
That's what I call racin'.

1402
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:43,120
<i>- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!</i>

1403
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,680
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1404
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:50,120
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1405
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,360
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1406
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,760
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1407
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:59,680
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1408
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,760
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1409
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,960
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1410
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,480
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1411
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,720
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1412
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,200
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1413
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,800
- Boo!
- Boo!

1414
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,840
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1415
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,920
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1416
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,000
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1417
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,640
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1418
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,640
You're The King! Yeah!

1419
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:47,920
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1420
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,520
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1421
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,320
Thanks, Doc.

1422
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,720
Hey, Lightnin'.

1423
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:00,320
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1424
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:04,080
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1425
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,800
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1426
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,760
But I didn't win.

1427
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,320
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1428
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,960
He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1429
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,040
buzzards used to circle the car!

1430
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,760
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1431
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:28,400
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1432
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,560
I'm gonna stick with them.

1433
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:34,560
Well, I sure can respect that.

1434
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,760
Still, you know,

1435
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:39,520
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1436
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,000
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1437
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,320
Actually, there is one thing.

1438
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,120
Whoo-hoo!

1439
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:52,920
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1440
01:41:57,240 --> 01:42:00,080
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1441
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,800
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1442
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,120
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1443
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:13,120
to get tires.

1444
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:17,200
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1445
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,280
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1446
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,560
A real Ferrari!

1447
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,640
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1448
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:30,040
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1449
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:34,720
<i>Wow.
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.</i>

1450
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,040
<i>Mi dicono che siete fantastici.</i>

1451
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:54,120
Just passin' through?

1452
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,400
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1453
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:59,600
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1454
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:03,280
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1455
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,720
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1456
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,480
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1457
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,960
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1458
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,960
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1459
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,120
blah, blah, blah.

1460
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,400
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,</i>

1461
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:24,880
<i>K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!</i>

1462
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,160
Great timing, Mater!

1463
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:31,040
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

1464
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,440
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

1465
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,320
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1466
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,960
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1467
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,520
Hmm... Nah.

1468
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,360
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1469
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:51,600
Ah-choo!

1470
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,160
All right, everybody
please keep together now.

1471
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:01,800
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1472
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:04,720
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1473
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:08,680
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1474
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:12,040
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1475
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:15,760
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

1476
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Yeah!

1477
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,520
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1478
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,520
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

1479
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,480
Doc! Doc!

1480
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,160
Whoo-ah!

1481
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:37,720
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1482
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:57,000
Attention!
Kiss the pavement goodbye.

1483
01:45:57,080 --> 01:46:00,400
When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!

1484
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:04,120
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!

1485
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,160
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!

1486
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,160
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1487
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:11,920
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1488
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,360
Huh? Look at this!

1489
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,520
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1490
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,560
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1491
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:25,960
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look? Ah-choo!

1492
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:32,600
Oh, dang.

1493
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,960
<i>You are a toy car!</i>

1494
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:45,600
<i>You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.</i>

1495
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,600
<i>Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!</i>

1496
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:52,240
<i>Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!</i>

1497
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,560
<i>Birthday guests at three o'clock!</i>

1498
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:57,840
Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

1499
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,360
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

1500
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,880
<i>We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!</i>

1501
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,560
<i>But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!</i>

1502
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:12,720
<i>- You're still not listening!
- Ah!</i>

1503
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,280
<i>Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?</i>

1504
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:20,120
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

1505
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,560
<i>Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!</i>

1506
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:23,960
<i>Circus cars?</i>

1507
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:26,400
<i>How can you be circus cars?</i>

1508
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,880
<i>These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,</i>

1509
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,880
<i>and they're gonna make me rich!</i>

1510
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,040
Wait a minute here.

1511
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:34,480
They're just usin' the same actor
over and over.

1512
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:37,000
What kind of a cut-rate production
is this?

1513
