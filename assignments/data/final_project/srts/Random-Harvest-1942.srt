1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:38,320
Our story takes you down
this shadowed path...

3
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:42,691
to a remote and guarded building
in the English Midlands:

4
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,883
Melbridge County Asylum.

5
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:49,356
Grimly proud of its new military wing...

6
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,485
which barely suffices...

7
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,958
in this autumn of 1918...

8
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:57,824
to house the shattered minds...

9
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:01,325
of the war that was to end war.

10
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,867
Now, Mr. And Mrs. Lloyd...

11
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:16,129
I should warn you
that even if he is your son...

12
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,293
he may not recognize you.

13
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:22,829
His memory is affected,
and he has trouble with his speech:

14
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:24,835
The result of shock.

15
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:26,998
He was picked up by the Germans...

16
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:30,699
in a shell hole near Arras in 1917...

17
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:34,699
close to death
and with no means of identification.

18
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:38,674
When he returned to consciousness
in a German hospital...

19
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,038
he could remember nothing at all
of his past life.

20
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,366
He had no name...

21
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:47,206
he had no family
with whom he could correspond.

22
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:52,442
Six months ago, he was exchanged
through Switzerland and sent here.

23
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:56,840
I sincerely hope he proves to be your son.

24
00:02:57,747 --> 00:03:00,043
I believe that he could be cured...

25
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:04,713
with patience and care
in normal surroundings.

26
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,482
May we see him now?

27
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:10,176
Certainly.

28
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:14,610
Please, Mrs. Lloyd, don't hope too much.
I've seen many disappointments.

29
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,982
Good morning, boys.
This is just an informal visit.

30
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,880
Good morning, Clayton.

31
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,313
Sleeping better? You just keep it up.

32
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:35,087
Well, now, Trempitt, what's going on?

33
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:38,488
I thought you and I were friends.
Last time we shook hands.

34
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,647
Don't you remember?

35
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:44,059
Well, don't bother today
if you don't feel like it.

36
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,392
You can't discourage me.

37
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:54,820
There. You see, my boy? That's the spirit.

38
00:03:55,063 --> 00:03:58,587
You and I will be going into town
very soon for a glass of beer...

39
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,061
to Melbridge Arms.

40
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:01,858
Would you like that?

41
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:04,956
Fine. Won't be long now.

42
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,394
Well, Smith...

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,828
you are looking better, really improved.

44
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:19,263
- Don't you think so, Doctor?
- Very much.

45
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:25,236
We have some news for you. Interested?

46
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:29,667
There are some people here
who are very anxious to see you.

47
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:32,804
Mr. And Mrs. Lloyd.

48
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:39,367
Lloyd?

49
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,206
The name mean anything to you?

50
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:46,833
Their son was reported missing in 1917.

51
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,734
At Arras.

52
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:53,810
Now don't pin your hopes on it.

53
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,174
You may be their son, you may not.

54
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,135
We'll soon know.

55
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:03,505
My parents.

56
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,706
There. You see, my boy?
You speak well enough when you want to.

57
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:08,372
It's just a matter of confidence.

58
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,007
You've just got to
get back your confidence.

59
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,011
My father.

60
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:18,916
Doctor, dress him up a bit
and take him to the reception room.

61
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,780
Very well. Come along, Smith.

62
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,313
Lloyd.

63
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:38,384
Sit down, old man.

64
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,523
If they are your parents...

65
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,322
They would take me out of here?

66
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:55,584
That's rather a big if, old man. Sit down.

67
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,493
Lloyd.

68
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,402
- He is not your son, then?
- No.

69
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,035
I'm sincerely sorry.

70
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,998
I told you, my boy, not to count on it.

71
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,372
Out in this weather, Major?
You are a one for a walk, ain't you?

72
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,809
Proper old pea soup this is.

73
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:39,212
I'm all right, thank you.

74
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:42,817
Coat's very warm.

75
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,247
I like to walk.

76
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,156
Proper old pea soup.

77
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:01,561
The war's over! Peace!

78
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,688
There's an armistice!

79
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,226
What is it you want?

80
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:22,498
Come on, I haven't got all night.

81
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,028
Cigarette.

82
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,097
What sort?

83
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:36,199
Why, you're from the asylum. You're...

84
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,070
It's all right, dear. You take your time.

85
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,627
Have a nice look around, see.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

86
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:49,665
You are from the asylum, aren't you?

87
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:58,770
Yes, but I'm all right, really.

88
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,209
If you have given them the slip,
I wouldn't stay here.

89
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:07,938
She's gone straight to the phone.
She's telling them to come for you.

90
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:48,813
Can I help you?

91
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,050
I thought you weren't feeling too fit,
so I followed you.

92
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:53,920
You don't mind, do you?

93
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,354
You look tired out.

94
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:01,386
Been walking about for hours?

95
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,793
Well, how about a brandy and soda...

96
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:08,293
just to pull you together?
I'm gonna have one.

97
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,294
Shall we go over to the home pub?
It's just across the road.

98
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:14,760
It's not the Ritz, but it's where we all stay
when our show's in town.

99
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,626
It's, you know, friendly.

100
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,460
Come on.

101
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,528
Excuse us, please.

102
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,767
That was Ella. She's our character woman,
and he's our manager.

103
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,499
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Paula.

104
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:52,631
He's a dear, really.

105
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,297
- Hello, Paula.
- Hello, Brett.

106
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,067
Have a drink, and the army, too.

107
00:12:56,141 --> 00:13:00,199
- There, you see? You're amongst friends.
- Mind you, he was game, the gunner was.

108
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:03,309
Halfway through the 10th,
he run into my right hook...

109
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,342
and forgot his name and address.

110
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,775
You don't win fights
with your hands and feet.

111
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,504
You win them with your brains.

112
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:12,110
That's what brought me to the top.

113
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,479
What's it to be, my dear?
This is on the house.

114
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,638
Thank you, Biffer.

115
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,908
Mine's a Gin and French.
Can I have a brandy for my friend here?

116
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:24,971
With pleasure, my dear.
Looks as though he could do with it.

117
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,447
Feeling bad?

118
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:29,647
- No, I...
- He's just tired, that's all.

119
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:31,808
Not the flu, is it? Got them in the back.

120
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:34,146
Dying like flies at the hospital.

121
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:36,946
That's right, cheer him up.
Know any more funny stories?

122
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:40,746
I was only passing a remark.
It's a free country.

123
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,309
Pass him the free drink.
That'll do him more good.

124
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:47,217
Well, here it is,
and a drop of good stuff that is.

125
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:50,913
- Bring anybody back from the grave.
- The grave?

126
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:53,912
Aren't you a little ray of sunshine tonight?

127
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,957
- Paula. Don't be late.
- No, I won't, Sam.

128
00:13:57,824 --> 00:14:01,382
I've got to get over to the theater.
Goodbye, and thanks for the drinks.

129
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,152
- Shall we go?
- Well, there goes a hero for you.

130
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:06,523
- He's one of the men what done it.
- Right.

131
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:10,489
I must get over to the theater.
I've cut it pretty close.

132
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:14,219
It doesn't seem very friendly, does it,
running away like this?

133
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,659
What are you going to do?
Will you be all right?

134
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:19,924
- What am I to do with you?
- I'll be all right.

135
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,758
I'm not so sure.

136
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,354
Listen, how'd you like to see the show?

137
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,626
You can sit in my dressing room,
see the stage. No one will bother you.

138
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,563
Then we'll have a chat, shall we?

139
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:33,498
Just you and I,
and settle what's to be done.

140
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:35,790
Good? Good, come on.

141
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:43,502
Sorry to keep you waiting all this time,
but I'm so excited about peace.

142
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:47,635
I've got one eyebrow halfway up my
forehead and the other behind my left ear.

143
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,129
Just a second. I'll be with you.

144
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:03,774
Well? How do you like me?

145
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:06,073
Or don't you?

146
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,468
Good.

147
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:10,971
Now, talk to me.
Tell me all about yourself.

148
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,276
Why'd you give them the slip up
at the hospital?

149
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:16,335
You don't like the place?

150
00:15:17,212 --> 00:15:19,474
Surely you ought not to be there.

151
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,140
Come on. Answer me.

152
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,977
Cat got your tongue?

153
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:27,274
Make an effort.

154
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:32,107
I'm all right, really.

155
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,608
It's my speech. It's just nerves.

156
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:39,116
There, you see? You're doing splendidly.

157
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:43,111
Yes, I wasn't so bad then, was I?

158
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,810
I should say not.

159
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:49,687
You don't know what a job I have...

160
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:50,810
as a rule.

161
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:55,549
I can guess. I heard you up at that shop.
That old witch would scare anybody.

162
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,882
There's another thing.

163
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:02,350
I've lost my memory.

164
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,491
I don't even know who I am.

165
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,719
You mean...

166
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:13,794
I know who you are.
You're somebody awfully nice.

167
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:16,717
What did they call you at that place?

168
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:18,387
Smith.

169
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:21,192
It's not my real name.

170
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,791
- What's yours?
- Paula Ridgeway.

171
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:29,861
That's not my real name, either.

172
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:33,763
Look here, Smithy. You don't mind
if I call you Smithy, do you?

173
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,132
It can't be good for you up there
among all those poor souls.

174
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,360
You can't be happy.

175
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:41,932
And how are you ever going to get better
if you're unhappy?

176
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,134
Perhaps I shouldn't be very happy...

177
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,164
anywhere just now.

178
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:52,996
But, Smithy, the war's over.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

179
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:02,198
I'm just silly. Don't take any notice.
It's the day.

180
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:06,765
It's so splendid for most of us
and so sad for some.

181
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,531
Why did it have to be foggy and wet?

182
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,633
It should have been all sunshine
and golden day.

183
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,268
Never mind, Smithy.
We've met, anyway, haven't we?

184
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:21,311
Have you no friends,
no parents that you can trace?

185
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:25,076
Have you tried?

186
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,875
Some people
came to see me at the hospital...

187
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:35,045
but I wasn't their son.

188
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,110
I'll bet they were disappointed,
weren't they?

189
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:41,080
Yes, I think so.

190
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:44,016
I was, too.

191
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,179
I'd have liked to belong to them.

192
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:54,149
Smithy, you're ruining my makeup.

193
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:58,388
But how you do chatter.

194
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:02,679
Yes, I seem to have talked rather a lot.

195
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,218
That's me. I always bring people out.

196
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,348
Much too far, sometimes.

197
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,353
- Ridgeway.
- All right, thank you.

198
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:12,988
I've got to go and perform now.

199
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,893
Smithy, look...

200
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,453
I'll put your chair outside. Come along.

201
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:21,756
You can see the front of the stage
from here.

202
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:25,921
Just sit there and nobody will bother you.
I'll be back in a couple of shakes.

203
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:29,559
- You'll be all right, will you?
- I'm fine.

204
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:38,729
Sure?

205
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,889
Your head seems awfully hot.

206
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,057
- Paula. You're on.
- Coming.

207
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,716
I spoke to her father and asked,
"Could I marry Daisy?"

208
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,652
"Certainly you can," he says.

209
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,847
"Certainly. On one condition. "

210
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:05,946
"Name it!" says I.

211
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:09,421
Says he, "Get married in the house
and after the ceremony...

212
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,150
"you leave by the back door. "

213
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:13,588
"Leave by the back door?
Why would we do that?"

214
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:16,648
He say, "I'm telling you,
you leave by the back door...

215
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:19,625
"so that the hens
can get the benefit of the rice. "

216
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,453
I love her for herself alone.

217
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:29,496
She's the bonniest wee lassie
in all Scotland.

218
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,222
As Harry would say...

219
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,819
I knew the minute I seen him,
he had the flu.

220
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:16,923
Biffer, there's something
I ought to tell you.

221
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:19,891
- He's from the county asylum.
- No.

222
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,187
But he's all right, really.

223
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:26,055
He would have been discharged
if he had a home to go to.

224
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,491
You don't think they'll come after him,
do you?

225
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:30,857
Any busybody comes snooping after him...

226
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:33,259
I'll give him what I give the gunner.

227
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,093
- Biffer, you're a darling.
- He's a gentlemen, he is.

228
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:42,187
Liked him the minute
I first clapped eyes on him.

229
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,132
I'm all right.

230
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:57,699
It's just my speech. I can't remember.

231
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:02,162
Rest now, Smithy. You mustn't talk.

232
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,236
I'm not like the others.

233
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:07,700
I'm not like them. I'm all right.

234
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:10,131
Yes, Smithy, you're all right.

235
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:15,933
But I can't go back.

236
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:21,840
If I go back, I'll never come out.
I'll be like the others.

237
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:25,738
You shan't go back, Smithy.
I won't let you go back.

238
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:27,873
Rest now.

239
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:30,341
Rest, Smithy.

240
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:33,740
Just go to sleep.

241
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:58,444
Hurry down. Supper's on the table.
The train leaves at 1:00.

242
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,042
I'm all packed. I'll be back in a jiffy.

243
00:24:02,553 --> 00:24:05,042
How did the show go?

244
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:07,779
Splendidly. The last night.

245
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:09,781
Glad to get rid of us, I expect.

246
00:24:10,522 --> 00:24:12,045
How did you get on?

247
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:18,054
I talked to the chambermaid today.

248
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,023
- Had quite a chat with her.
- You did?

249
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:22,819
Wonderful. What about?

250
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:24,988
The weather.

251
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,123
You are coming on.

252
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:30,018
I see you're all packed. That's a good boy.
So am I.

253
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,888
Our train leaves at 1:00.

254
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:34,024
- Paula.
- Yes, Smithy?

255
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:38,255
You're sure I can be useful?

256
00:24:38,662 --> 00:24:41,288
Your manager isn't just taking me on...

257
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:44,088
because you asked him?

258
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:47,629
Good gracious, you don't know Sam.
He's as hard as nails.

259
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,095
No, you can take my word for it.
The whole thing was his idea.

260
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,459
I can't tell you what it means, Paula.

261
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,132
To be someone again, to be wanted.

262
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,464
It's all your doing.

263
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:04,661
How you do run on.

264
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,896
There's no stopping you
once you've started.

265
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,163
You just eat your supper.

266
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:12,137
I'll go down and I'll be up again
in time to fetch you for the train.

267
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:13,668
Goodbye.

268
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,602
- The usual?
- Please, Biffer.

269
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:27,671
Sam, he's as pleased as punch.
I wish you could have heard him.

270
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:29,003
You are an angel.

271
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:30,872
That's all right, old girl.

272
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:33,501
It's given him confidence
just knowing that he's wanted.

273
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:34,941
That's all he needs to get well.

274
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:37,273
- There you are.
- Thank you, Biffer.

275
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:42,513
Evening, Mr. W. What's it to be?

276
00:25:42,646 --> 00:25:46,239
Half and half, and rush it, will you?
They've been watching me like hawks...

277
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:48,177
since I blotted me copybook
Armistice Day.

278
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:49,237
Why?

279
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,542
One of our loonies slipped off in the fog...

280
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,842
while I was supposed to be
watching the gate.

281
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:56,212
Got clean away, uniform and all.

282
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:59,849
No. Really?
But you got him back, didn't you?

283
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:01,941
Not yet, but we shall.

284
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:06,014
- What sort of a bloke?
- It's getting late.

285
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:10,552
Tallish, dark hair, shuffles a bit.

286
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:14,418
Can't get his words out.
Always thinking something different.

287
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,755
He's not dangerous, I suppose?

288
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:19,980
There's no saying with loonies.
Quiet as mice for weeks.

289
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:22,523
Then all of a sudden,
up and after you with an ax.

290
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,951
Sam, I'm going in to supper. You coming?

291
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:26,286
Just a moment, Paula.

292
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,787
- Ella, coming?
- Coming.

293
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:46,287
It's time, isn't it? Nearly 12:30.

294
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:49,093
- Smithy.
- I'm all ready.

295
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,661
Sit down a minute, will you?

296
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:57,227
There's nothing wrong, is there?

297
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,493
Smithy, I've got to talk to you.

298
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:03,230
I won't beat about the bush.
Sam won't take you.

299
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:07,968
Won't take me?

300
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:10,867
There was a man from the asylum
in the bar just now.

301
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,334
He told everybody about your escape.

302
00:27:13,738 --> 00:27:16,261
Sam feels it's too risky taking you.

303
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:19,505
I think perhaps he's right.

304
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:22,596
I think perhaps you should go back
to the asylum...

305
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,629
until you're all well again, and then...

306
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:28,531
Go back?

307
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,904
It is best, Smithy.

308
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:36,272
You need care, and you need doctors
that understand your case.

309
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:41,434
I feel dreadful about it,
but it's for your sake.

310
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:44,509
Sam wants to help...

311
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,205
but he says I have no right to take you.

312
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:52,512
He says I'd be risking your sanity.

313
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:57,779
Your life, perhaps.
You do understand, don't you?

314
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,881
You're not angry with me? You don't think
that I've gone back on you?

315
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:04,912
It's not that I'm afraid.

316
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:10,080
It's because I think it's right.
They were all against me, all of them.

317
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:13,887
They couldn't have made me do it
if I didn't think it was right.

318
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:16,481
You do know that, Smithy, don't you?

319
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:21,018
Tell me you understand,
that you're not angry with me.

320
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:24,645
But tell me. Let me hear you say it.

321
00:28:26,257 --> 00:28:27,951
Speak to me, Smithy.

322
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,884
You could always speak to me.

323
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:05,395
Wait for me, Smithy.

324
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,302
Come on, Smithy. Get your coat on.

325
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:27,531
I know I'm right. I know it.

326
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,266
I'm ashamed of myself,
letting them talk me out of it.

327
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:32,500
Here. Let me help you. We'll have to hurry.

328
00:29:32,575 --> 00:29:35,303
Don't you worry, Smithy.
We can't go with the others...

329
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,399
but we'll find some quiet place
where you can rest and get fit.

330
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,975
Here's your hat. Take your parcels.
Come on.

331
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:43,034
We'll go by the back door.

332
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:58,010
I've got to see the Biffer.

333
00:29:58,082 --> 00:30:01,640
Go that way. Don't let anyone see you.
There's a door leading to the alley.

334
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,581
Wait for me outside. I'll only be a minute.

335
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:14,552
Biffer, here's the money for my bill.

336
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,085
What? Off already?

337
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:19,718
They want to send Smithy
back to the asylum.

338
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:20,811
No.

339
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:23,650
I'm not gonna let him go.
I'm taking him into the country.

340
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,348
Giving up your job?

341
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,389
I'll let you know when we get settled.

342
00:30:27,556 --> 00:30:30,580
- Will you send my trunk on to me?
- You bet, and good luck to you.

343
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:33,123
Thanks, Biffer.
You're one in a million. Goodbye.

344
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:34,919
Goodbye. Good luck.

345
00:30:50,963 --> 00:30:52,896
Smithy, what have you done?

346
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:54,452
- He tried to stop you?
- Yes.

347
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,622
Sam?

348
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:57,891
I pushed him and he fell.

349
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:00,631
If they get you now, you're done for.

350
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:03,355
- I'm no good. Let me alone.
- No. I won't.

351
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,523
- We can't leave him.
- We must.

352
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,399
We'll think later. Come.

353
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:10,033
But I'm no good. I'd better go back.

354
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:24,667
That was bad luck, the stationmaster
recognizing me at Melbridge.

355
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:29,362
They may have wired ahead
to Canford to stop us.

356
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,038
Well, we won't go on to Canford.

357
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,630
We'll get out at Swinton Junction.

358
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:40,337
From Swinton, we can go into
the west country to Devon or Cornwall.

359
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:44,931
We'll choose some little country place,
quiet and lovely.

360
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,943
It's the end of the world.

361
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:01,480
Lonely and lovely.

362
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:05,412
We'll be safe here, even if...

363
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,082
We'll phone first, and then we'll see.

364
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:30,044
All right, Mrs. Deventer, he can come
for a couple of hours tomorrow...

365
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:31,850
and I'll look in on Friday.

366
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:33,719
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Goodbye.

367
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,188
Goodbye.

368
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:39,748
- Morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

369
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,519
Sorry I wasn't down.

370
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:45,158
- Were you wanting rooms?
- Well, that depends.

371
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:48,919
- May I use your telephone?
- Certainly. It's in there.

372
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:50,725
Thank you.

373
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:53,987
Smithy, come and sit down.
You look worn out.

374
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:58,257
He does look poorly. The poor dear.

375
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,657
Is this the phone?

376
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:02,731
Yes. You just picks it up,
turns the handle...

377
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:04,286
Yes. Thank you.

378
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:11,964
I want to make a trunk call, please.

379
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,629
Melbridge 4294.

380
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:18,093
What?

381
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:20,725
Clevedon 2707.

382
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,429
Hello?

383
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,527
Hello, Paula.

384
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:33,262
No, he's all right. Come to in a jiffy.

385
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,600
Right as rain, barring a bump on his head.

386
00:33:37,174 --> 00:33:39,038
Big as an apple, it was.

387
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:43,072
That fellow of yours must have given him
what I gave the gunner.

388
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:45,700
What? A bump.

389
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,873
Biffer, don't make me laugh.
I'll go into hysterics. What?

390
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:56,243
He is an angel. So are you.

391
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:59,505
Do you mind if I rush off now
and tell Smithy? He'll be so happy.

392
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,374
A thousand thanks, darling, and goodbye.

393
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:06,871
Smithy, it's all right.

394
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:09,914
Isn't it wonderful? Sam's all right.

395
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:13,014
Now you have nothing
to worry about, nothing.

396
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,813
Sam's being awfully decent about it.
He says it was just an accident.

397
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:18,180
An accident?

398
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:23,511
It's a friend of ours who had a bad fall.

399
00:34:23,586 --> 00:34:26,610
We were terribly worried about him,
but it's all right.

400
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,817
And we would like to stay...

401
00:34:29,488 --> 00:34:31,318
that is, if you can have us.

402
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:35,555
Well, I've got a nice double front.
Sun comes in all day.

403
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,679
Just the thing for your husband
after the flu.

404
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:43,849
He's not my husband.

405
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:47,787
Not yet, I mean.
We're just sort of engaged.

406
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:51,657
I've got two nice rooms adjoining...

407
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:54,554
with hot and cold and a view of the lake.

408
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:56,355
If you'd like to come up.

409
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,860
Smithy, isn't it wonderful?

410
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:05,090
I'm so thankful. I was terribly worried.

411
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:08,529
All you have to do is to get well,
and you will get well, won't you...

412
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:11,861
in this lovely place?
Say it. Let me hear you say it.

413
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:14,422
- I will.
- That's the spirit.

414
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:18,522
I had to tell her we were engaged.
You don't mind, do you?

415
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:20,465
I thought you was behind me.

416
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:23,393
Don't you want to see the rooms?

417
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:26,095
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.
We're just coming.

418
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:27,825
Come on, Smithy.

419
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:26,709
If I were you, I'd open it.

420
00:36:26,786 --> 00:36:31,277
Smithy, you are a fraud.
I'm simply dying of curiosity.

421
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:34,280
It's from Liverpool, from that newspaper.

422
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:36,181
I say. So it is.

423
00:36:36,255 --> 00:36:39,347
"Liverpool Mercury. Managing Editor,
Samuel C. Henson. "

424
00:36:39,423 --> 00:36:41,549
Must be about that article you sent them.

425
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:45,216
- Yes, I suppose it could be.
- For pity's sake, Smithy, open it.

426
00:36:54,894 --> 00:36:57,417
- It's a check.
- I don't believe it. Let me look.

427
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:59,858
It's a small check, but it's a check.

428
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:03,886
Smithy, how wonderful.

429
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:07,788
- Aren't you terribly happy?
- Yes, I am.

430
00:37:08,531 --> 00:37:11,725
- Means an awful lot.
- Smithy, I'm proud of you.

431
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:14,731
You didn't know you had an author
on your hands, did you?

432
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:18,732
Yes, I did. I knew you were good.
I'm really not a bit surprised.

433
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,997
You think I can sell another?

434
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:23,796
Another and another and another.
Lots of them.

435
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,097
Smithy, I wonder if you were a writer
before you...

436
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,462
- Before the war.
- Yes, I've wondered that, too.

437
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:37,765
Aren't you terribly curious?
About the past, I mean?

438
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,396
Well, I'd like to know,
but the present's looking up.

439
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:42,701
Supposing it all
came back to you suddenly...

440
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,438
and it was awfully grand,
with all sorts of wonderful people?

441
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:48,235
I wouldn't mind a bit.

442
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,603
You might even be married, Smithy.
Who knows?

443
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:51,868
Nonsense.

444
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:55,500
- How can you be so sure?
- Well, because...

445
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:02,504
Paula, I wonder
if I could make a living at writing.

446
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:03,771
Of course you could.

447
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:06,176
Make a regular income, be independent.

448
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:10,807
Why not?

449
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,877
And I'm getting quite good at typewriting.

450
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:24,375
It's a lot of nerve, but...

451
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,879
I've fallen in love with you.

452
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,313
No, you haven't.
You're just being a gentleman.

453
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:39,284
No. I'm nothing of the sort.

454
00:38:40,055 --> 00:38:42,214
I'm asking you to marry me...

455
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:45,519
on a check for two guineas.

456
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,146
Smithy, don't ask me, please.

457
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:52,451
I might take you up on it.
I'm just that shameless.

458
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:53,513
Paula.

459
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:56,650
I've run after you from the very beginning.
You know I have.

460
00:38:56,727 --> 00:39:00,387
I've never let you out of my sight
since I first saw you in that little shop.

461
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:03,119
- Never do it, Paula.
- What?

462
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:06,858
Never leave me out of your sight.
Never again.

463
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:11,859
Smithy, you do mean it?

464
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:15,087
You do want it? Really?

465
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:18,490
More than anything else in the world.

466
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:22,023
My life began with you.

467
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,656
I can't imagine a future without you.

468
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:29,895
I better say yes quickly
before you change your mind.

469
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,559
It's yes, darling.

470
00:39:37,037 --> 00:39:38,833
Now I can relax.

471
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:46,097
I'm hungry.

472
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,168
- Smithy.
- What is it?

473
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,702
But, darling, you proposed to me...

474
00:39:56,442 --> 00:39:58,533
and I've accepted you...

475
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,674
What's wrong?

476
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:05,044
Smithy, do I always
have to take the initiative?

477
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:08,073
You're supposed to kiss me, darling.

478
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:46,233
Goodbye.

479
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,697
- I'm so happy for you.
- Goodbye. God bless you both.

480
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:54,831
Thanks, Vicar. Thanks, Doctor.
Thanks again for all your kindness.

481
00:41:55,274 --> 00:41:57,264
- Here. Take this.
- Doctor, no.

482
00:41:57,408 --> 00:42:00,204
That's all right. Keep it for the christening.

483
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:02,439
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

484
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:28,146
I must oil that hinge.

485
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:30,042
Wait.

486
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:37,206
- I must cut that back.
- No, darling. It's so pretty.

487
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:46,645
Home.

488
00:42:58,658 --> 00:42:59,783
Home.

489
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:43,133
- Today, is it, sir?
- I think so.

490
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,726
- Have you got the nurse in?
- Three days ago.

491
00:43:45,904 --> 00:43:48,666
- Pretty trying, this business.
- I know how you feel, sir.

492
00:43:48,738 --> 00:43:50,863
Been through it myself.

493
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:53,769
- Did your wife suffer much?
- No, nothing to speak of.

494
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,635
But me, crikey.

495
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,165
Got neuralgia, have you?

496
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,139
- I don't think so.
- Lucky.

497
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,107
I had it something cruel with our second.

498
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:08,704
- What they call synthetic pain.
- Do they?

499
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,334
That's the scientific name for it.

500
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:14,906
I said I'd never face it again,
but you know how it is.

501
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:17,774
Here I am with four
and more bad news on the way.

502
00:44:19,813 --> 00:44:21,370
Well, good luck to you, sir.

503
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:01,823
It's all right, Smith.

504
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:06,119
She's out of danger now.
It's been a hard fight, but she's made it...

505
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:08,492
and you have a son.

506
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:12,683
Come on. Pull yourself together.
She's all right.

507
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:17,091
Nothing in the world to worry you now.
It's a boy. That's what you wanted.

508
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:19,492
And eight pounds of him, too.

509
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:24,359
Don't you want to see her
after all her trouble?

510
00:45:27,365 --> 00:45:29,025
Of course you do.

511
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,499
Good morning.
I've dropped in to register a new subject.

512
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:01,699
- Name of child?
- We're calling him John, after me.

513
00:46:01,774 --> 00:46:04,332
My wife thinks he's the image of me,
but I don't see it.

514
00:46:04,408 --> 00:46:05,931
Really? And the date?

515
00:46:06,008 --> 00:46:09,304
He has her eyes, blue,
and when he smiles...

516
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:11,865
he's just like my wife, except for the teeth.

517
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:15,104
Yes, well, you can't expect everything
all at once.

518
00:46:15,177 --> 00:46:17,973
- What did you say the date was?
- November 6.

519
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:20,011
- Don't you want his weight?
- No, thank you.

520
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:23,534
Eight pounds, three and a half ounces.
He's gained an ounce a day since.

521
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:26,444
- It's remarkable.
- Father's profession?

522
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:29,003
Writer. In a small way, of course.

523
00:46:29,415 --> 00:46:32,609
Writer and parent. Parent in a big way.

524
00:46:32,682 --> 00:46:35,080
That will be all. Yes. Thank you.

525
00:46:35,149 --> 00:46:38,207
But you can form only
a very inadequate picture of him...

526
00:46:38,283 --> 00:46:41,614
- from what I've given you.
- I'll have to struggle along.

527
00:46:41,685 --> 00:46:43,947
- I'll bring him in one of these days.
- Do that.

528
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:46,416
Then you can see for yourself.
Do I get a receipt?

529
00:46:46,486 --> 00:46:47,747
You do.

530
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:52,781
- Thank you very much. I'll bring him in.
- Do that.

531
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:14,091
Hi, nurse!

532
00:47:14,993 --> 00:47:18,017
Here you are. I don't think I forgot a thing.

533
00:47:18,094 --> 00:47:20,560
- Is he asleep?
- Lf he was, he isn't now.

534
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:21,753
Wait.

535
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,359
- Did I wake him?
- No.

536
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:37,766
I brought him a present.

537
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,364
Will he like it? Will he know it's a cat?

538
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:48,892
- Smithy.
- Yes.

539
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:51,436
- Come here.
- What?

540
00:47:51,503 --> 00:47:52,800
No, here.

541
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:01,669
Look, I'm Mrs. Smith.
Do you remember me?

542
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:12,807
What's so wonderful about that fellow?
He just eats and sleeps.

543
00:48:12,876 --> 00:48:14,842
Much of the time, he's not even friendly.

544
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:17,740
It would never occur to you
to buy me a present, would it?

545
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,071
Never.

546
00:48:21,978 --> 00:48:24,706
- Smithy.
- They're not very much.

547
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:29,210
- I adore them, darling.
- They're just the color of your eyes.

548
00:48:29,813 --> 00:48:32,507
You're an awfully nice
color scheme, darling...

549
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,479
and your hair is like a bright new penny.

550
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,673
- Mr. And Mrs. Smith here?
- Yes.

551
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:41,579
It must be the vicar.

552
00:48:45,284 --> 00:48:47,478
- Hello, Vicar! Come in.
- Good morning.

553
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:51,144
Is it all right for the vicar to come in?
Good heavens!

554
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:54,451
How do you do, Mrs. Smith? How are you?

555
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,282
Very well, thank you, Vicar.

556
00:48:56,354 --> 00:49:00,014
- And how is the heir?
- Take a look.

557
00:49:00,422 --> 00:49:03,685
Hello, young fellow.
He's quite a size, isn't he?

558
00:49:04,189 --> 00:49:06,985
Bigger and stronger
than babies twice his age.

559
00:49:08,924 --> 00:49:10,753
I was at the post office just now.

560
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:14,985
I found Mrs. Goodbody
in a lather of excitement.

561
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:18,389
There had been an extraordinary event.
A telegram!

562
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,086
- No.
- How very thrilling. Who got it?

563
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:22,593
- You did.
- I?

564
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:26,858
Probably someone congratulating you
upon becoming a father.

565
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,788
Aren't you ever going to tell me
what's in it?

566
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:40,989
I can't believe it. It's fantastic.

567
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:43,294
Darling, please,
I can't stand it another second.

568
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:46,129
It's from Liverpool,
from the editor of The Mercury.

569
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:48,133
Read it out loud.

570
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:52,329
"Can you appear at Mercury office
10:00 tomorrow morning...

571
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:56,865
"November 14,
regarding permanent position on paper?

572
00:49:57,603 --> 00:49:59,900
"Samuel C. Henson, Editor. "

573
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:02,137
Oh, darling.

574
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:04,503
Smithy, how marvelous.

575
00:50:04,572 --> 00:50:07,038
Marvelous? It's incredible.

576
00:50:07,973 --> 00:50:10,633
"Can you appear at Mercury office
tomorrow morning... "

577
00:50:15,842 --> 00:50:17,808
Goodness, you're a terrible packer.

578
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:21,331
Let me see, shirts, socks, tie...

579
00:50:23,477 --> 00:50:25,671
May I ask what you're going to sleep in?

580
00:50:25,745 --> 00:50:28,610
Great Scott! Have I forgotten
the pajamas?

581
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:34,640
This cuff's a bit frayed,
but I don't suppose Keats was very dressy.

582
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:39,811
That's better.

583
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:42,447
All these labels.

584
00:50:42,515 --> 00:50:44,744
He'll think I'm a commercial traveler.

585
00:50:44,817 --> 00:50:46,783
- Are you excited?
- Wildly.

586
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:51,180
Think what it means.
A start in life, a career.

587
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:56,075
I'll be able to do things for you,
things I've always dreamed of.

588
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,644
I wish I could come, too.

589
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,618
Yes. I've been thinking of that,
but I daren't wait.

590
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,415
He might change his mind.

591
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:08,549
Darling, you're not worrying about me,
are you?

592
00:51:09,156 --> 00:51:12,452
I'll be all right.
I feel absolutely sure of myself.

593
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:16,586
I know. I shan't worry.

594
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,183
It's just...

595
00:51:21,193 --> 00:51:22,784
Our first parting.

596
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:28,986
- When will you be back?
- Tomorrow night.

597
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:31,085
I'll be in on the 8:00 train.

598
00:51:31,162 --> 00:51:33,651
- Where will you stay?
- I hadn't thought.

599
00:51:33,729 --> 00:51:35,355
The Great Northern isn't bad.

600
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:38,329
It's the best of the cheap hotels
and it's near the station.

601
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:40,159
- Got your key?
- Yes.

602
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:46,024
That must be the vicar. I must run.

603
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,226
Goodbye, darling.

604
00:52:09,406 --> 00:52:11,032
Goodbye, young fellow.

605
00:52:15,274 --> 00:52:18,434
- Take very good care of my little family.
- Indeed, I will, sir.

606
00:52:18,508 --> 00:52:20,372
Goodbye, darling.
See you tomorrow night.

607
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:23,204
Tomorrow night. Good luck, Smithy.

608
00:52:41,048 --> 00:52:43,708
Can you tell me,
where is the Mercury office?

609
00:52:43,782 --> 00:52:45,078
The Liverpool Mercury.

610
00:52:45,149 --> 00:52:47,911
Second on the left, sir, off George Street.

611
00:52:47,983 --> 00:52:50,415
- Thanks.
- Taxi, sir? Looks like rain.

612
00:52:50,484 --> 00:52:52,814
No, thanks. I'll take a chance.

613
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,914
Paper! Get your paper! Paper, sir?

614
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,746
Read The Liverpool Mercury!

615
00:53:05,821 --> 00:53:08,344
Election results! Paper, ma'am? Paper, sir?

616
00:53:08,654 --> 00:53:11,985
Read The Liverpool Mercury!
Election results! Paper, sir?

617
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,755
- Liverpool Mercury...
- Is this George Street?

618
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:19,654
- I'm looking for the Mercury office.
- Right across the street, on the corner.

619
00:53:19,724 --> 00:53:21,657
Paper! Paper, sir?

620
00:53:25,693 --> 00:53:26,989
Look out!

621
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:55,462
Call an ambulance.

622
00:54:35,545 --> 00:54:38,774
He'll be all right. He's coming around now.

623
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:48,338
Feeling better?

624
00:54:50,516 --> 00:54:52,846
You've got an unholy bump there.

625
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:55,947
Looks worse than it is, though.

626
00:54:56,217 --> 00:54:58,183
You're lucky, I'd say.

627
00:54:58,317 --> 00:55:01,375
- Do you feel any pain?
- My head aches a bit.

628
00:55:01,752 --> 00:55:04,810
It would be funny if it didn't.
Quite a wallop.

629
00:55:05,086 --> 00:55:06,416
My shoes.

630
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,786
A good blacking is all they need.

631
00:55:10,221 --> 00:55:11,880
What on earth...

632
00:55:14,822 --> 00:55:16,686
This is all wrong.

633
00:55:17,823 --> 00:55:21,347
- I've no business to be in civvies.
- What should you be in?

634
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:24,390
In uniform, of course.
I'm on active service.

635
00:55:26,058 --> 00:55:29,389
- Where the devil am I, anyway?
- You're in Liverpool.

636
00:55:30,993 --> 00:55:32,391
Liverpool?

637
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,359
You've had a nasty shock.

638
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:36,393
You better go somewhere
and rest for a while.

639
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:38,052
Try not to think about anything.

640
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:40,594
- Is this the party who had the accident?
- Yes, Officer.

641
00:55:40,662 --> 00:55:43,891
It's not my fault.
He slipped in the mud right in front of me.

642
00:55:43,963 --> 00:55:46,486
- Is that the right of it?
- It's the truth, Captain.

643
00:55:46,564 --> 00:55:48,928
- I think so.
- What cabby says is correct, Officer.

644
00:55:48,998 --> 00:55:51,158
I saw the accident from my window there.

645
00:55:51,232 --> 00:55:54,858
- Can I have your name, please, sir?
- Rainier, Charles Rainier.

646
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:58,025
- Rainier. Profession, sir?
- Captain of the Wessex Regiment.

647
00:55:58,101 --> 00:55:59,828
Address, please.

648
00:56:00,535 --> 00:56:02,330
The trenches, Arras.

649
00:56:03,202 --> 00:56:05,168
I beg your pardon, sir?

650
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:10,768
- Random Hall, North Random, Surrey.
- Thank you, sir.

651
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:13,629
You don't wish to lodge a complaint, sir?

652
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:17,001
Thank you, no.
I'm sure whatever happened was my fault.

653
00:56:17,072 --> 00:56:19,402
All right. Thanks, Mr. Rainier.

654
00:56:20,007 --> 00:56:21,597
Thanks, guvnor.

655
00:56:21,773 --> 00:56:23,899
Sure you feel strong enough to walk?

656
00:56:23,974 --> 00:56:27,099
A little dizzy still, but I'll manage it.

657
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:32,075
Quite a bump.

658
00:56:35,044 --> 00:56:37,806
Apart from that, what do I owe you?

659
00:56:37,877 --> 00:56:40,310
- Never mind that.
- Thank you.

660
00:56:41,245 --> 00:56:42,711
- Thanks.
- It's all right, sir.

661
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:44,711
- Here's your hat.
- Yes.

662
00:56:44,946 --> 00:56:49,642
- Sure you don't want me to call a cab?
- No, thanks. The air will brace me up.

663
00:56:56,883 --> 00:56:59,747
By the way, would you mind telling me...

664
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:02,712
what day is this?

665
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:05,314
This is Thursday.

666
00:57:05,385 --> 00:57:08,318
Thursday, yes, but the date?

667
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,248
November 14, 1920.

668
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,448
Thanks.

669
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:29,623
1920. Three years gone.

670
00:57:30,759 --> 00:57:32,191
Three years.

671
00:57:34,259 --> 00:57:36,725
France, I remember distinctly.

672
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:42,224
An ensign was killed. Young Davis.
But after that?

673
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:44,921
What after that?

674
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,486
Liverpool? What am I doing here?

675
00:57:49,764 --> 00:57:51,458
Where have I been?

676
00:57:53,464 --> 00:57:57,989
Better go home. Yes. May clear things up.
Better go home.

677
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,331
Mr. Sheldon, I'm sorry to wake you...

678
00:58:27,407 --> 00:58:30,340
but there's a gentleman here
asking for you.

679
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:34,232
He says he's Mr. Charles. Charles.

680
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:38,742
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheldon.
That's what he says.

681
00:58:45,612 --> 00:58:47,976
The butler says
he'll come straight down, sir.

682
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:49,706
Step inside, sir.

683
00:58:51,447 --> 00:58:53,208
Take a seat, sir.

684
00:58:54,814 --> 00:58:58,838
You'll excuse me taking precautions, sir,
it being late and all.

685
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:00,745
It's quite all right.

686
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:05,073
Is Miss Bridget at home, do you know?

687
00:59:05,151 --> 00:59:07,777
Yes, sir. The whole family's at home.

688
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:12,441
Really? Everything's all right
up at the house, I hope.

689
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:16,416
Haven't you heard, sir?
Old Mr. Rainier died Sunday.

690
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,579
The funeral was today, sir.

691
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,187
Was he a relative of yours, sir?

692
00:59:29,657 --> 00:59:31,317
He was my father.

693
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:33,648
I'm sorry, sir.

694
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:45,921
I don't feel much like eating, but still.
I must say I think it most peculiar.

695
00:59:47,258 --> 00:59:49,020
After three years of complete silence...

696
00:59:49,092 --> 00:59:52,616
he suddenly comes back from the grave
with this cock-and-bull story...

697
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:55,250
and at the very moment
when the will is to be read.

698
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:57,122
Very convenient, if you ask me.

699
00:59:57,194 --> 01:00:00,991
- You talk as if my brother were a fraud.
- Who's to say he isn't?

700
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:04,619
- You seem to forget Sheldon's seen him.
- Yes, in the dark...

701
01:00:04,695 --> 01:00:06,685
and Sheldon was probably half-asleep.

702
01:00:06,763 --> 01:00:09,252
Isn't this argument rather a waste of time?

703
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:11,558
We shall see him for ourselves
in a moment...

704
01:00:11,631 --> 01:00:13,222
and with all respect to Lydia...

705
01:00:13,298 --> 01:00:16,753
I think we shall be able
to recognize our own brother.

706
01:00:17,266 --> 01:00:19,596
- Morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

707
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:21,895
- Morning, Mother.
- Morning, darling.

708
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:23,956
Where's Uncle Charles?

709
01:00:24,368 --> 01:00:27,801
He's not down yet.
Besides, we're not all deaf, dear.

710
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:31,196
I'm sorry. I'm just dying to see him.
It's all so romantic...

711
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,202
like a thriller in the railway bookstore...

712
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,328
Back From The Dead
or The Disappearing Uncle.

713
01:00:35,404 --> 01:00:38,371
Yes, or Three Years In Darkest Amnesia.

714
01:00:38,437 --> 01:00:40,495
Three years! Think of it.

715
01:00:40,572 --> 01:00:42,663
Where do you suppose he's been
all that time?

716
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,434
That's just what I've been asking.
In jail, for all we know.

717
01:00:46,507 --> 01:00:50,304
Did Truslove say positively
that the will was written 10 years ago?

718
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:54,399
Yes, and I gather the estate
is divided equally between all of us...

719
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:56,806
with the exception
of the two business interests...

720
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:59,604
- which, naturally, fall to me.
- Naturally.

721
01:00:59,877 --> 01:01:03,241
- And this house, which goes to Charles.
- To Charles?

722
01:01:03,845 --> 01:01:05,902
But why on earth
should Charles get the house?

723
01:01:05,978 --> 01:01:08,002
That gives him more than Chet,
the eldest son.

724
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,875
- Morning, Uncle George.
- Morning, Kitty. Morning, everybody.

725
01:01:10,947 --> 01:01:13,778
- Morning.
- I say, have you heard the news?

726
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:15,673
Plenty for all and plenty more...

727
01:01:15,748 --> 01:01:19,704
when up-to-date methods are used
in the handling of our various interests.

728
01:01:19,782 --> 01:01:23,181
In fact, without being unduly optimistic,
I think I may say...

729
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,307
Sausages, by Jove!

730
01:01:25,384 --> 01:01:28,215
But if the whole matter's
gonna be treated as a joke...

731
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:31,116
Sit down, Chet. It's no joke to me.

732
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:35,981
That is, supposing it really is Charles
who's suddenly turned up like a...

733
01:01:37,054 --> 01:01:38,713
Like a bad penny?

734
01:01:42,322 --> 01:01:45,016
Hello, my dear fellow. How are you?

735
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:47,988
- Hello, Chet. How are you?
- Delighted to see you, Charles.

736
01:01:48,057 --> 01:01:50,751
- Welcome home, darling.
- Hello, darling.

737
01:01:51,024 --> 01:01:52,820
- Charles, this is jolly.
- My dear.

738
01:01:52,891 --> 01:01:56,347
Charles, dear, how nice to see you.

739
01:01:57,259 --> 01:02:00,192
You haven't met Henry yet, have you?

740
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,920
A new brother-in-law?
How do you do? Congratulations.

741
01:02:02,994 --> 01:02:06,154
- Thank you very much.
- You remember Lydia.

742
01:02:06,228 --> 01:02:07,489
- How are you?
- How are you?

743
01:02:07,562 --> 01:02:09,392
- Hello, old chap.
- I'm Kitty.

744
01:02:09,462 --> 01:02:11,258
Jill had to take me when she took Daddy.

745
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,819
How do you do, Kitty?
Please sit down, all of you.

746
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:17,330
- I'm afraid I'm upsetting your breakfast.
- Here's a chair. Next to mine.

747
01:02:17,398 --> 01:02:19,887
- What can I get you?
- You go on with your breakfast...

748
01:02:19,965 --> 01:02:22,397
- and I'll forage for myself.
- Go ahead, my dear chap.

749
01:02:22,465 --> 01:02:24,830
We're all absolutely delighted
to see you back.

750
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,456
Have to kill the fatted calf, what?

751
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:28,591
I'll settle for a couple
of George's sausages.

752
01:02:28,668 --> 01:02:31,533
- Lf he's left any.
- Plenty. I'm on a diet.

753
01:02:31,735 --> 01:02:35,793
- By Jove, he's kidding. Amazing.
- They sound absolutely deafening.

754
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:40,700
By the way, my dear fellow,
Truslove's reading the will this morning.

755
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:43,567
It's 10 years old,
so you won't be done out of your share...

756
01:02:43,638 --> 01:02:46,833
- which includes the house, I understand.
- Really?

757
01:02:47,172 --> 01:02:49,832
I'm sure you're all waiting
for some sort of explanation.

758
01:02:49,906 --> 01:02:53,999
I really haven't got one.
That's what loss of memory does for you.

759
01:02:54,341 --> 01:02:56,603
Sheldon's told you all I know.

760
01:02:56,908 --> 01:02:59,171
I was in Liverpool yesterday morning.

761
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,232
Why or how, I've no idea.

762
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:05,938
I'd been knocked down by a taxi
and came to in a chemist's shop.

763
01:03:06,011 --> 01:03:08,671
Before that, I can't remember a thing.

764
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:13,907
Since a shell hole in France,
and that was three years ago.

765
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,970
Those three years
are a complete blank to me.

766
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:20,014
I don't know what I've done,
where I've been.

767
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:24,510
I found a little money in my pocket
and this key.

768
01:03:25,983 --> 01:03:27,415
The key to your house?

769
01:03:27,483 --> 01:03:29,881
If I knew that, I'd know where I belong.

770
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:32,213
- You belong here, Uncle Charles.
- Yes?

771
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,581
Yes, of course. This house.

772
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,419
I hope you'll all still think of it as home
and come whenever you like...

773
01:03:41,487 --> 01:03:44,045
and stay as long as you care to,
now or anytime.

774
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:46,883
- Charles...
- I shall come. Often.

775
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:51,778
- I'm terribly glad you're my uncle.
- Thank you, Kitty.

776
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:01,692
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

777
01:04:01,759 --> 01:04:03,691
- Sorry you're leaving.
- Well, Charles.

778
01:04:03,759 --> 01:04:07,056
Take care, old chap, won't you?
Excuse my left hand.

779
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:10,657
Hello, Uncle Charles!
I've come to say goodbye!

780
01:04:10,728 --> 01:04:12,592
- Hello, Kitty. You off, Julian?
- Yes.

781
01:04:12,662 --> 01:04:16,322
I don't think I shall call you uncle.
You're not really my uncle.

782
01:04:16,396 --> 01:04:20,056
Forward minx. Goodbye, Charles.
Let's meet again sometime, somewhere.

783
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,323
We must.

784
01:04:21,397 --> 01:04:22,886
- Goodbye, young woman.
- Goodbye.

785
01:04:22,965 --> 01:04:25,488
Let's sit down, shall we? Come on.

786
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:30,299
Mother will be hours yet.
She's always late.

787
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,392
Can I have a puff of that cigarette?

788
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:37,001
Do you think you should?

789
01:04:37,069 --> 01:04:39,900
All the girls at Kerwood smoke
as soon as they're in sixth.

790
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:42,960
- You don't mind, do you?
- Why should I?

791
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:54,538
Charles, aren't you going to be...

792
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:57,870
terribly lonely all by yourself
in this big house?

793
01:04:57,941 --> 01:04:59,430
Perhaps. Why?

794
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:02,737
Only when people are lonely...

795
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,640
they're rather apt to marry
the first woman who comes along.

796
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,734
It doesn't do, you know.

797
01:05:08,811 --> 01:05:10,572
- It doesn't?
- Never.

798
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:12,835
Not once, in all your years of experience?

799
01:05:12,912 --> 01:05:15,003
I shall be 18 in three years.

800
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,212
- I'll keep you in mind.
- Will you?

801
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:21,274
I know you're laughing at me...

802
01:05:21,348 --> 01:05:24,644
but please don't do anything rash
in the meantime...

803
01:05:26,315 --> 01:05:30,146
because I do like you awfully,
from the very first moment.

804
01:05:31,383 --> 01:05:33,906
Is this a leap year, by any chance?

805
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:36,147
I don't know, and I don't care.

806
01:05:36,218 --> 01:05:39,582
- I've said it and I mean it.
- I'll have to think it over.

807
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:43,809
Anyway, don't you think
that I might come here in the holidays...

808
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,577
and sort of take care of you?

809
01:05:45,654 --> 01:05:48,120
- What would Mother say?
- Jill? She wouldn't mind.

810
01:05:48,188 --> 01:05:50,950
- She loves to get rid of me.
- Kitty!

811
01:05:51,022 --> 01:05:52,885
You'll write to me, won't you?

812
01:05:52,955 --> 01:05:54,649
- Kitty!
- Will you?

813
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:57,049
All right, if you want me to.

814
01:05:57,123 --> 01:05:59,113
Here I am, waiting.

815
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:01,657
Goodbye, Charles. Goodbye, Sheldon.

816
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:03,692
- I've simply got to fly.
- Goodbye, my dear.

817
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:07,749
- Lovely to see you. Come along, Kitty!
- Goodbye.

818
01:06:08,026 --> 01:06:10,652
- Goodbye, Kitty.
- Goodbye, Uncle Charles.

819
01:06:10,727 --> 01:06:14,422
Thanks for asking me
to come and visit you in the holidays.

820
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,697
- Will you be dining at home, sir?
- Yes, I suppose so.

821
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:47,362
- Alone, sir?
- There's no one else, is there?

822
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,995
I thought perhaps you might like to ask
the vicar or Dr. Hampstead.

823
01:06:51,071 --> 01:06:54,095
I don't think so, Sheldon. Thank you.

824
01:06:54,172 --> 01:06:57,400
I'm afraid you'll be very lonely
in this great house.

825
01:06:57,473 --> 01:07:00,770
May one ask, sir,
have you any plans for the future?

826
01:07:01,474 --> 01:07:03,907
No. I might go back to Cambridge.

827
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:06,305
I never got my degree.

828
01:07:06,676 --> 01:07:10,836
I might take a fling at writing.
I always wanted to, if you remember.

829
01:07:15,411 --> 01:07:18,276
I wonder what he would have
liked me to do.

830
01:07:18,512 --> 01:07:22,809
I think he always wanted you to carry on
at Rainier's where he left off, sir.

831
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,846
But Mr. Chetwynd
is head of Rainier's now.

832
01:07:24,914 --> 01:07:27,904
Yes, now, sir, but... We shall see.

833
01:07:29,815 --> 01:07:32,373
In any case, I'm not a businessman.

834
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,249
- Have you ever tried, sir?
- No.

835
01:07:50,587 --> 01:07:53,315
I wonder what I was doing in Liverpool.

836
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:01,749
"Dear Uncle Charles... "

837
01:08:02,757 --> 01:08:05,588
or "Dear Charles. "

838
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:09,847
What do you think?

839
01:08:09,926 --> 01:08:13,587
He's not really my uncle, you know,
and I have intentions.

840
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:23,985
"Dear Charles, so you've left Cambridge
and gone into the business.

841
01:08:24,996 --> 01:08:28,054
"What a shame.
I know you hated to leave your books...

842
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:31,996
"and that quiet corner of the river
where Rupert Brooke used to dream.

843
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:36,658
"Mother says you're simply a wizard at it.
We're all going to be rich again.

844
01:08:37,233 --> 01:08:39,063
"Write to me soon.

845
01:08:42,634 --> 01:08:44,692
"I keep all your letters.

846
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:47,426
"Sentimental little college girl.

847
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:51,036
"Dear Uncle Charles.

848
01:08:52,404 --> 01:08:56,929
"Dear Charles, I've graduated with honors.

849
01:08:58,372 --> 01:09:01,464
"I'm sending you my photograph
in cap and gown.

850
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,269
"Will you put me on the desk
in your study?

851
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,899
"And please, look at me sometimes.

852
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:14,806
"Dear Charles... My dear Charles...

853
01:09:16,576 --> 01:09:19,372
"just to remind you that I'm growing up.

854
01:09:19,811 --> 01:09:21,710
"I have lots of beaus.

855
01:09:22,278 --> 01:09:24,302
"I do hope you're jealous.

856
01:09:25,179 --> 01:09:27,975
"By the way, I saw your picture
in the paper.

857
01:09:28,047 --> 01:09:29,707
"I was impressed.

858
01:09:30,948 --> 01:09:33,380
"'Industrial Prince of England... "

859
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:35,244
"'Mr. Charles Rainier. "'

860
01:09:41,684 --> 01:09:43,310
Hello, nuisance.

861
01:09:49,086 --> 01:09:50,347
My word.

862
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,177
Do you like it?

863
01:09:53,387 --> 01:09:55,512
My dear, you look adorable.

864
01:09:55,955 --> 01:09:58,114
Adore me. I can bear it.

865
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:03,148
- Haven't I seen that hat before?
- It's not a bad hat, is it?

866
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:04,848
It's a lovely hat.

867
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:07,152
Now it will be a lovely lunch.

868
01:10:07,223 --> 01:10:09,917
My dear, I cannot possibly afford the time.
Come on.

869
01:10:09,991 --> 01:10:12,322
Yes, you can. Miss Hanson says so.

870
01:10:12,392 --> 01:10:15,052
She says it will do you good
to get out of this office...

871
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:16,853
for an hour or two.

872
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:19,188
Or two?

873
01:10:22,162 --> 01:10:24,025
- Miss Hanson.
- Yes, Mr. Rainier.

874
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:26,028
Owing to lamentable weakness
of character...

875
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:28,927
I'm having lunch at the Savoy
with your approval.

876
01:10:28,997 --> 01:10:30,258
- I thoroughly approve.
- You do.

877
01:10:30,331 --> 01:10:32,024
I do, Mr. Rainier.

878
01:10:32,597 --> 01:10:34,063
Will you get me a copy...

879
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:36,256
of the Brown-Severing prospectus
while I'm out?

880
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,628
- Yes, I will.
- Have I any appointments for 2:00?

881
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:41,189
- Yes.
- Can you postpone them?

882
01:10:41,267 --> 01:10:43,062
- Yes, I can.
- Thanks.

883
01:10:44,068 --> 01:10:45,125
All right, young woman...

884
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:48,258
I can give you precisely
one hour and a half from door to door.

885
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:50,131
No. Miss Hanson said two hours.

886
01:10:53,903 --> 01:10:55,130
Thank you.

887
01:10:58,972 --> 01:11:00,733
- Cigarette?
- Please.

888
01:11:01,706 --> 01:11:05,264
You're being very charming today.
You haven't looked at your watch once.

889
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,898
- That reminds me.
- No, please. Can't you relax for an hour?

890
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,203
An hour? It's just on 3:00.

891
01:11:12,475 --> 01:11:15,499
- You used to say that you hated business.
- Did I?

892
01:11:15,642 --> 01:11:16,734
You know you did.

893
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,572
You were going to whip things into shape
and get out quickly.

894
01:11:19,643 --> 01:11:21,507
That was the original idea.

895
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:24,772
To save the family and then be off
before they needed more saving.

896
01:11:24,845 --> 01:11:29,210
- In that slow and careful way of yours?
- I began to look into things, yes.

897
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,838
I found that Rainier's
kept other families going, too.

898
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:37,143
Little families in little homes.
Thousands of them, all over England.

899
01:11:37,715 --> 01:11:40,114
I see. Uncle Atlas, eh?

900
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:45,178
Don't you ever want to get out
and have fun?

901
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:48,550
Kitty, the last time I...

902
01:11:49,018 --> 01:11:50,814
It's that woman you sent me,
Lady Maxton.

903
01:11:50,885 --> 01:11:52,874
One of the most interesting cases
I've had...

904
01:11:52,952 --> 01:11:54,942
since I have been in private practice.

905
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,610
Well, goodbye.

906
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:01,786
Goodbye, Lola, and don't forget
that you're dining with me on Thursday.

907
01:12:01,855 --> 01:12:03,151
Goodbye.

908
01:12:11,358 --> 01:12:12,790
What is it?

909
01:12:13,157 --> 01:12:16,249
Pardon me. It was nothing.
It was just for a moment, that voice...

910
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:18,814
- Was familiar?
- Not that, exactly...

911
01:12:18,892 --> 01:12:23,690
but it seemed to remind me of something
that I didn't have time to get a grip on.

912
01:12:25,128 --> 01:12:26,889
That happens to me sometimes.

913
01:12:26,961 --> 01:12:31,918
A sort of wisp of memory
that can't be caught before it fades away.

914
01:12:32,396 --> 01:12:34,795
- From those lost years?
- Perhaps.

915
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,788
Now, what were you saying?

916
01:12:38,465 --> 01:12:42,023
That you should take a holiday.
You've got money enough, heaven knows.

917
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:44,362
- Money, yes, but not the time.
- That's nonsense.

918
01:12:44,432 --> 01:12:46,865
You could make the time.
How old are you?

919
01:12:46,934 --> 01:12:48,866
None of your business.

920
01:12:50,668 --> 01:12:53,760
- You're awfully nice-looking, Charles.
- Thank you.

921
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:57,535
Clever, interesting.

922
01:12:59,937 --> 01:13:01,460
It's not fair.

923
01:13:02,304 --> 01:13:03,430
Why?

924
01:13:04,638 --> 01:13:07,605
Because you've spoiled me for other men,
that's why.

925
01:13:07,672 --> 01:13:08,832
Kitty.

926
01:13:09,339 --> 01:13:12,795
It's no secret, is it?
I've always been mad about you...

927
01:13:14,008 --> 01:13:15,804
even as a schoolgirl.

928
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:18,697
It might be fun if you loved me now.

929
01:13:19,109 --> 01:13:21,235
We're a lot alike, you know.

930
01:13:21,376 --> 01:13:23,536
We laugh at the same things.

931
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:26,042
We have marvelous times together.

932
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:30,574
I sometimes wonder why you don't.

933
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:34,170
In my slow and careful way...

934
01:13:34,246 --> 01:13:36,542
I've wondered sometimes, too.

935
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,611
Why don't you? Just to be curious.

936
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:46,377
I haven't said that I don't.

937
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:48,012
Oh, no.

938
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,842
Would it be too incredible?

939
01:13:53,752 --> 01:13:56,776
- It would be fantastic.
- Then it is fantastic.

940
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:00,883
But I don't believe it.
I don't believe that you mean it.

941
01:14:00,953 --> 01:14:03,079
That you'll go on meaning it.

942
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:05,382
I shall wake up and find it isn't real at all.

943
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:07,387
- It's just a dream.
- No.

944
01:14:08,022 --> 01:14:11,217
You do want me?
I'm not just a schoolgirl to you?

945
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:14,521
Darling, you're very sweet and dear to me.

946
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,314
I'm building a great hope on you.

947
01:14:19,392 --> 01:14:21,154
I don't believe any of it.

948
01:14:21,259 --> 01:14:24,055
At the office tomorrow,
you'll have forgotten all about it.

949
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,093
I'll have Miss Hanson remind me.

950
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,786
Charles, darling, it's too wonderful.

951
01:14:30,361 --> 01:14:32,157
Take me out of here.

952
01:14:32,962 --> 01:14:35,224
Take me somewhere and kiss me.

953
01:15:25,209 --> 01:15:26,732
- Yes?
- Mr. Rainier, may I bring in...

954
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:30,004
Yes, Miss Hanson. I'm sorry.
Bring it in, please.

955
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:57,316
I've scribbled a note here.
Will you take care of it? And this.

956
01:15:58,052 --> 01:16:00,746
Is the Ray-Novaille prospectus ready yet?

957
01:16:00,819 --> 01:16:04,411
They promised it for 4:00.
I'll send it in as soon as it arrives.

958
01:16:05,987 --> 01:16:07,977
You saw this offer
from Harwood and Williams?

959
01:16:08,055 --> 01:16:09,714
Yes, Mr. Rainier.

960
01:16:09,988 --> 01:16:12,477
You worked for Harwood and Williams
once, I believe.

961
01:16:12,555 --> 01:16:14,886
They're driving a hard bargain.

962
01:16:15,289 --> 01:16:17,654
- Do you think they're bluffing?
- I think not.

963
01:16:17,723 --> 01:16:19,713
I used to know Mr. Williams pretty well.

964
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:23,224
- I was his secretary.
- Yes. I remember he was quite annoyed...

965
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:25,315
when you came to me.
He called me a pirate.

966
01:16:25,392 --> 01:16:28,416
That was not fair.
It was really all my doing.

967
01:16:28,493 --> 01:16:29,857
Indeed?

968
01:16:29,927 --> 01:16:33,860
I'd heard Miss Lindy was leaving you,
and I applied for the position.

969
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:35,450
May I ask why?

970
01:16:36,861 --> 01:16:40,090
A few weeks before, I'd come across
a picture of you in a magazine.

971
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:43,528
Underneath, it said,
"Industrial Prince of England. "

972
01:16:43,597 --> 01:16:46,120
- Dear me.
- I was impressed.

973
01:16:46,198 --> 01:16:49,323
I decided then I must leave
Harwood and Williams to better myself.

974
01:16:49,398 --> 01:16:53,093
I'm sincerely glad you did.
You make things much easier for me.

975
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:54,689
What's all this?

976
01:16:54,766 --> 01:16:57,892
That's the report on that firm
in the Midlands.

977
01:16:58,834 --> 01:17:00,960
The Melbridge Cable Company.

978
01:17:04,636 --> 01:17:08,797
Yes, my brother thinks this would be
a very valuable subsidiary.

979
01:17:09,137 --> 01:17:12,070
I have a large file.
Photographs of the works.

980
01:17:12,138 --> 01:17:14,502
- Would you care to see it?
- Please, yes.

981
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:35,341
Bring me
the Melbridge Cable Company report.

982
01:17:35,411 --> 01:17:37,070
Yes, Miss Hanson.

983
01:17:38,245 --> 01:17:39,506
Hello.

984
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,069
Yes, I did, Mr. Manders.
Can you make it 4:30 this afternoon?

985
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:48,507
That would be splendid. He's very busy.
Thank you.

986
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:50,838
Market reports?

987
01:17:51,115 --> 01:17:54,980
In 10 minutes, and thanks
for the flowers. They're lovely.

988
01:17:55,049 --> 01:17:57,073
I thought you'd like them.

989
01:17:59,951 --> 01:18:01,644
Thank you, Sheila.

990
01:18:36,094 --> 01:18:38,357
Their equipment's up-to-date.

991
01:18:39,462 --> 01:18:42,122
And they seem to have plenty of space.

992
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:44,594
It does seem worth investigating.

993
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:48,653
I'll get my brother to run down.

994
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:50,787
I'm taking a long holiday.

995
01:18:50,864 --> 01:18:53,695
- Are you? At once?
- In about a month or so.

996
01:18:54,799 --> 01:18:56,856
Why, I think that's a very good idea.

997
01:18:56,933 --> 01:19:00,094
I may be gone a year.
If things can be arranged.

998
01:19:00,934 --> 01:19:02,127
A year?

999
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:05,092
If it's humanly possible.

1000
01:19:07,235 --> 01:19:09,566
I'm being married, Miss Hanson.

1001
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:13,361
You're the first to hear my news.

1002
01:19:13,437 --> 01:19:16,063
I'm afraid it'll mean
a lot of extra work for you...

1003
01:19:16,138 --> 01:19:18,037
putting things in order so I can get away.

1004
01:19:18,106 --> 01:19:21,004
- It's Miss Chilcet, I suppose.
- Yes, it's Kitty.

1005
01:19:21,072 --> 01:19:25,165
- Was it so obvious?
- Not at all. She's a very charming girl.

1006
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,968
Yes, I fully agree.

1007
01:19:29,341 --> 01:19:33,866
I hope you won't take it into your head
to follow my example, Miss Hanson.

1008
01:19:34,009 --> 01:19:36,874
I don't know what I should do without you.

1009
01:19:37,677 --> 01:19:40,075
I have been married, Mr. Rainier.

1010
01:19:40,144 --> 01:19:42,338
Remember, I told you
when I took the position.

1011
01:19:42,412 --> 01:19:44,674
Yes, to be sure. It slipped my memory.

1012
01:19:44,745 --> 01:19:47,234
You had a child, I believe.

1013
01:19:47,379 --> 01:19:51,210
Yes. A little boy. He died.

1014
01:19:53,482 --> 01:19:55,812
Yes. I remember. I'm sorry.

1015
01:20:01,417 --> 01:20:04,611
You'll see that Mr. Chetwynd gets this,
will you?

1016
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,844
And I'll let him have the file later.

1017
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:13,345
Hello?

1018
01:20:15,054 --> 01:20:18,851
Yes, he's here. Miss Chilcet.

1019
01:20:19,955 --> 01:20:21,251
Hello.

1020
01:20:22,123 --> 01:20:25,749
Definitely. You want me to confirm it
in writing?

1021
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:29,084
You absurd young person.

1022
01:20:30,891 --> 01:20:33,517
What's that? No, Kitty. Of course not.

1023
01:20:43,495 --> 01:20:46,462
- Paula, don't.
- John, let me tell him.

1024
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:49,018
- That you're his wife?
- Yes.

1025
01:20:50,563 --> 01:20:52,791
You can risk it, if you wish.

1026
01:20:53,064 --> 01:20:54,530
I hope you won't.

1027
01:20:54,731 --> 01:20:57,289
But what do I risk now?

1028
01:20:58,031 --> 01:21:01,624
What do you want of him, Paula?
His name? His protection?

1029
01:21:05,067 --> 01:21:06,863
I want him as he was.

1030
01:21:07,934 --> 01:21:09,457
I want his love.

1031
01:21:09,535 --> 01:21:12,559
Paula, two years ago,
you walked into his office.

1032
01:21:12,636 --> 01:21:15,159
If the sight of you
did nothing to restore his memory...

1033
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:16,430
what can words do?

1034
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:19,494
When you came to me at Melbridge
shortly after he disappeared...

1035
01:21:19,571 --> 01:21:23,095
I told you I was sure
he hadn't deserted you knowingly.

1036
01:21:23,172 --> 01:21:27,230
I told you a door in his mind had opened,
but another had closed.

1037
01:21:27,807 --> 01:21:29,898
I warned you even that if you found him...

1038
01:21:29,974 --> 01:21:32,032
the chances were
he wouldn't recognize you.

1039
01:21:32,107 --> 01:21:33,630
You gave me a hope.

1040
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:37,437
There's always that hope,
but the impetus must come from within.

1041
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:40,305
It can't be forced on him from outside.

1042
01:21:41,177 --> 01:21:44,632
You can tell him the truth
and claim your legal rights.

1043
01:21:45,378 --> 01:21:49,141
But what is going to be his attitude
when a strange woman appears...

1044
01:21:49,212 --> 01:21:51,770
and suddenly claims to be his wife?

1045
01:21:53,447 --> 01:21:55,038
He'd resent me.

1046
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:57,406
He'd accept me.

1047
01:21:58,548 --> 01:22:00,105
He'd pity me...

1048
01:22:02,182 --> 01:22:03,479
and he'd resent me.

1049
01:22:03,549 --> 01:22:08,040
I can only offer you that frail hope
that someday the miracle will happen...

1050
01:22:08,351 --> 01:22:12,011
and he'll come back to you,
not as Charles Rainier, but as...

1051
01:22:12,085 --> 01:22:14,517
What was it you used to call him?

1052
01:22:15,586 --> 01:22:17,449
- Smithy.
- As Smithy...

1053
01:22:18,053 --> 01:22:21,679
with all his emotion for you
as warm and intact as it was...

1054
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:23,687
on the day he left you.

1055
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:29,089
That's not much help to me, John, is it?

1056
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:34,620
I'm real, these tears are real,
and my jealousy is real...

1057
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:37,190
and my need of him.

1058
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:42,056
Paula, I wish I could help you.

1059
01:22:50,295 --> 01:22:51,989
What will you do?

1060
01:22:53,363 --> 01:22:56,159
I don't know. I'll have to think it out.

1061
01:22:57,264 --> 01:23:01,755
- You go to your dinner.
- I'll call it off if you'll dine with me.

1062
01:23:02,266 --> 01:23:03,959
No, don't do that.

1063
01:23:04,599 --> 01:23:08,532
Dear John. Always firm, but kind.

1064
01:23:10,134 --> 01:23:12,032
Thank you for the hope.

1065
01:23:12,735 --> 01:23:17,101
That is rather nice of me,
seeing that it robs me of mine.

1066
01:23:19,603 --> 01:23:21,297
Good night, John.

1067
01:23:26,472 --> 01:23:29,768
The law is quite clear on that point,
Mrs. Smith.

1068
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:33,800
If it is proved that for a period of
not less than seven years...

1069
01:23:33,907 --> 01:23:35,874
no news of a person has been received...

1070
01:23:35,941 --> 01:23:39,305
by those who would naturally hear of him
if he were alive...

1071
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:42,171
then he may be legally presumed dead.

1072
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:46,365
You wish me to take the necessary steps?

1073
01:23:46,443 --> 01:23:47,704
Please.

1074
01:23:48,178 --> 01:23:50,576
Now, to complete the particulars.

1075
01:23:51,312 --> 01:23:53,403
Did you prosecute a search?

1076
01:23:55,046 --> 01:23:58,774
Yes, we investigated accidents
that had occurred on that day.

1077
01:23:59,114 --> 01:24:01,376
- Without result?
- Yes.

1078
01:24:02,382 --> 01:24:04,905
Then I became seriously ill.

1079
01:24:05,715 --> 01:24:08,477
I was ill for many months. My baby died.

1080
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:13,073
As soon as I could get about,
I made some effort to return to the stage...

1081
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:14,912
but without success.

1082
01:24:15,218 --> 01:24:18,344
I worked as a waitress, a saleswoman.

1083
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,345
I studied stenography at night school.

1084
01:24:21,953 --> 01:24:25,216
Spent every penny I could spare
trying to trace my husband.

1085
01:24:25,354 --> 01:24:27,877
Thought he might have been taken
to a hospital...

1086
01:24:27,955 --> 01:24:29,785
or perhaps an asylum.

1087
01:24:30,656 --> 01:24:34,020
But years passed,
and I found no trace of him.

1088
01:24:34,957 --> 01:24:37,082
Are you employed at present?

1089
01:24:37,224 --> 01:24:40,055
For the last two years,
I've worked as a private secretary.

1090
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:44,081
- To whom?
- To Mr. Charles Rainier.

1091
01:24:47,327 --> 01:24:51,351
I've studied your petition, Mrs. Smith...

1092
01:24:51,727 --> 01:24:53,387
and the affidavits attached.

1093
01:24:53,461 --> 01:24:57,360
In regard to the evidence presented,
I have entered the decree to the effect...

1094
01:24:57,429 --> 01:25:01,385
that the man known as John Smith
shall be presumed to be dead...

1095
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:04,856
and your marriage to him
consequently dissolved.

1096
01:25:10,233 --> 01:25:11,426
Hello, you two!

1097
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,558
I wish you'd remember
you're getting married on Wednesday.

1098
01:25:14,634 --> 01:25:17,828
That odd little Mr. Beddoes
has been waiting in the chapel for ages.

1099
01:25:17,901 --> 01:25:21,994
Oh, dear! How dreadful of me. I forgot.
He wants us to choose the hymns.

1100
01:25:22,069 --> 01:25:24,558
We'll go down. Back in a few minutes.
What's for tea?

1101
01:25:24,636 --> 01:25:26,830
Muffins, old boy! Terrific!

1102
01:25:36,574 --> 01:25:38,199
That's nice.

1103
01:25:38,273 --> 01:25:40,001
I forget the words.

1104
01:25:53,477 --> 01:25:55,239
Yes, I remember now.

1105
01:25:55,946 --> 01:25:59,242
Then there's another lovely one.
Nearly always used.

1106
01:25:59,646 --> 01:26:02,874
This, perhaps: O Perfect Love.

1107
01:26:31,488 --> 01:26:33,283
Yes, that's it.

1108
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,913
I like that. Don't you, Charles?

1109
01:27:31,837 --> 01:27:32,997
What is it, Kitty?

1110
01:27:33,071 --> 01:27:36,038
I'm sorry, darling.
I must have been dreaming.

1111
01:27:36,105 --> 01:27:38,072
It's all right, Charles.

1112
01:27:38,539 --> 01:27:40,335
I'm glad it happened.

1113
01:27:40,907 --> 01:27:42,702
- It's better.
- Better?

1114
01:27:44,307 --> 01:27:45,967
What has happened?

1115
01:27:49,775 --> 01:27:51,537
I've been uncertain.

1116
01:27:52,509 --> 01:27:54,533
Almost from the beginning.

1117
01:27:55,811 --> 01:27:57,277
Now I'm sure.

1118
01:28:00,012 --> 01:28:01,739
It's no use, is it?

1119
01:28:02,679 --> 01:28:05,145
I've always known it. Really.

1120
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,114
I was grasping selfishly
at my own happiness.

1121
01:28:13,716 --> 01:28:16,512
Because you could make me
perfectly happy.

1122
01:28:18,783 --> 01:28:21,477
If I were selfish enough not to care...

1123
01:28:22,484 --> 01:28:24,678
or stupid enough not to know.

1124
01:28:25,552 --> 01:28:27,018
To know what?

1125
01:28:27,986 --> 01:28:29,782
That I'm not the one.

1126
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:32,610
Let's be honest about it.

1127
01:28:34,921 --> 01:28:37,013
I was letting things drift.

1128
01:28:38,356 --> 01:28:41,255
But I never really believed in my own luck.

1129
01:28:44,024 --> 01:28:48,582
Charles, you looked at me just now
as if I were a stranger.

1130
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:52,120
An intrusive stranger.

1131
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:56,588
Trying to take the place of someone else.

1132
01:28:58,394 --> 01:28:59,758
Someone else?

1133
01:28:59,861 --> 01:29:02,760
I know it sounds absurd, but let me say it.

1134
01:29:05,229 --> 01:29:06,627
Sometimes...

1135
01:29:08,163 --> 01:29:10,755
especially when we've been closest...

1136
01:29:12,565 --> 01:29:17,260
I've had a curious feeling
that I remind you of someone else.

1137
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,363
Someone you once knew.

1138
01:29:22,767 --> 01:29:25,734
Don't leave me, Kitty. I need you.

1139
01:29:26,968 --> 01:29:28,992
I'm trying to make a life.

1140
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:32,829
With someone you love
as you'll never love me.

1141
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,897
I am nearly the one, Charles.

1142
01:29:39,972 --> 01:29:42,961
So nearly that I shall always be proud of it.

1143
01:29:46,374 --> 01:29:49,068
But nearly isn't enough for a lifetime.

1144
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:53,375
It would be too hard to...

1145
01:29:58,677 --> 01:30:02,633
I've left it rather late, haven't I? I'm sorry.

1146
01:30:05,212 --> 01:30:06,974
I think I'll travel.

1147
01:30:07,113 --> 01:30:10,477
Mother's going to Luxor, I believe.
I'll go with her.

1148
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,909
- Kitty...
- It's all right, Charles.

1149
01:30:15,015 --> 01:30:17,811
I asked for it, and I'll get over it.

1150
01:30:19,882 --> 01:30:21,610
One does, you know.

1151
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,843
I shan't go in any tragic mood...

1152
01:30:24,951 --> 01:30:29,078
but looking to see what fun I can find,
and I usually can.

1153
01:30:31,352 --> 01:30:35,376
You'll probably hear
that I've married some nice man.

1154
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:38,052
I don't know what to say.

1155
01:30:43,255 --> 01:30:45,552
You don't have to say anything.

1156
01:30:46,923 --> 01:30:49,515
But because I am so nearly the one...

1157
01:30:50,858 --> 01:30:54,655
and because I love you
more than anyone I shall ever marry...

1158
01:30:56,925 --> 01:30:58,915
will you kiss me goodbye?

1159
01:31:30,535 --> 01:31:32,933
Well, we can't keep this up indefinitely.

1160
01:31:33,002 --> 01:31:34,525
Where in the devil is he?

1161
01:31:34,603 --> 01:31:38,468
No normal man walks out of a big concern
without saying a word to a solitary soul.

1162
01:31:38,537 --> 01:31:40,935
Everything was arranged.
Could he have gone abroad?

1163
01:31:41,004 --> 01:31:44,267
He would have let us know.
Confound that girl!

1164
01:31:44,638 --> 01:31:46,832
What the deuce could have happened?

1165
01:31:46,906 --> 01:31:49,464
One minute they were picking hymns
for the wedding...

1166
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:50,597
- Mr. Chetwynd?
- What now?

1167
01:31:50,674 --> 01:31:54,505
I'm sorry, sir. It seems to be important.
Stourton of the Lytham Liberal League.

1168
01:31:54,574 --> 01:31:57,564
All right, I'll see him. You talk to Sheldon.

1169
01:32:01,176 --> 01:32:04,439
Sheldon, when did you say
you last saw Mr. Rainier?

1170
01:32:05,244 --> 01:32:09,268
It was close to dinnertime, miss.
About an hour after Miss Kitty left.

1171
01:32:09,345 --> 01:32:12,506
Mr. Charles asked me
to put some things into a bag for him.

1172
01:32:12,579 --> 01:32:14,443
I don't know quite why, miss...

1173
01:32:14,514 --> 01:32:17,969
but I sort of think
that he may have gone to Liverpool.

1174
01:32:20,214 --> 01:32:22,204
- To Liverpool?
- Yes, miss.

1175
01:32:22,882 --> 01:32:25,111
It was from Liverpool he came that night...

1176
01:32:25,183 --> 01:32:28,173
that he came back from the dead,
as you might say.

1177
01:32:28,483 --> 01:32:33,008
Please try to tell me everything you
can remember about that night in 1920.

1178
01:32:34,118 --> 01:32:37,381
What did he tell you
about what had happened to him?

1179
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:41,576
Well, miss, it was a wet night.
In November, it was.

1180
01:32:42,654 --> 01:32:47,179
He'd been knocked down by a taxi and
carried into a chemist's shop in Liverpool.

1181
01:32:52,223 --> 01:32:53,450
Come in.

1182
01:33:05,527 --> 01:33:06,925
Miss Hanson.

1183
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:16,226
Please forgive me for coming.
We were all so anxious.

1184
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,121
You're not well.

1185
01:33:18,497 --> 01:33:21,657
I should have let you know where I was.
I intended to. I'm sorry.

1186
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:24,562
I hate to bother you,
but something very important came up.

1187
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:26,792
How did you know I was in Liverpool?

1188
01:33:26,933 --> 01:33:30,832
- Something Sheldon said. I made inquiries.
- Sheldon, yes.

1189
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,631
Won't you sit down, Miss Hanson?

1190
01:33:34,635 --> 01:33:38,193
You say some important business
induced you to follow me?

1191
01:33:38,436 --> 01:33:41,733
Sir Edward Lake, Member of Parliament
from West Lytham...

1192
01:33:41,804 --> 01:33:44,895
died on Monday morning.
There will be a by-election.

1193
01:33:45,137 --> 01:33:48,502
This morning, a committee
of the West Lytham Liberal Association...

1194
01:33:48,572 --> 01:33:51,232
unanimously decided
to support your candidacy...

1195
01:33:51,306 --> 01:33:54,602
should you consent to stand
in the Liberal interest.

1196
01:33:55,407 --> 01:34:00,272
Did Sheldon tell you of my experience here
about 12 years ago?

1197
01:34:02,109 --> 01:34:03,735
Yes, Mr. Rainier.

1198
01:34:05,409 --> 01:34:07,535
I came back here at that time...

1199
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:09,838
hoping to stumble on the trail of my past...

1200
01:34:09,911 --> 01:34:12,377
but I failed then...

1201
01:34:13,845 --> 01:34:15,607
and I've failed now.

1202
01:34:16,979 --> 01:34:19,172
- Nothing helped you?
- Nothing.

1203
01:34:21,081 --> 01:34:24,344
Why should I feel
a sense of loss so acute that...

1204
01:34:24,881 --> 01:34:27,075
That it's spoiling your life?

1205
01:34:27,183 --> 01:34:29,308
No, I'm not being honest with myself.

1206
01:34:29,383 --> 01:34:32,316
My life's not complete,
and I've hurt others.

1207
01:34:34,217 --> 01:34:37,013
I don't know why I bore you
with my affairs.

1208
01:34:37,085 --> 01:34:39,608
You feel that perhaps
you lived in Liverpool?

1209
01:34:39,685 --> 01:34:42,050
- It seems possible.
- But not certain.

1210
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,177
You mean I might have been
visiting the city?

1211
01:34:44,253 --> 01:34:46,446
Well, Liverpool's a big port.

1212
01:34:46,587 --> 01:34:50,782
I might have come in on some ship.
Strange. That hadn't occurred to me.

1213
01:34:50,888 --> 01:34:52,286
Or by train.

1214
01:34:52,856 --> 01:34:55,755
You might have come in
from a nearby town...

1215
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:58,152
or from the country.

1216
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:01,019
- Perhaps on business.
- Perhaps.

1217
01:35:02,559 --> 01:35:05,492
In that case,
maybe you stayed at some hotel.

1218
01:35:05,892 --> 01:35:08,723
I know Liverpool. I've been up here often.

1219
01:35:09,194 --> 01:35:12,456
You know the direction you were
walking in when the accident happened?

1220
01:35:12,527 --> 01:35:14,050
Yes, I checked that.

1221
01:35:14,128 --> 01:35:17,959
I was walking down Mason Street
toward the square. It was wet.

1222
01:35:18,262 --> 01:35:20,956
Well, there are two hotels
north of Mason Street.

1223
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:24,464
There's the old Olympic
and the Great Northern.

1224
01:35:27,998 --> 01:35:30,396
It's quite a distance from the Olympic.

1225
01:35:30,466 --> 01:35:34,331
So, if it was wet, the chances are,
you were coming from the Great Northern.

1226
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,390
Presuming I stayed at a hotel at all,
under what name was I registered?

1227
01:35:38,868 --> 01:35:41,028
There's just one chance to find out.

1228
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:45,160
If you were at a hotel, you walked out
leaving unclaimed luggage.

1229
01:35:45,603 --> 01:35:47,229
Would they keep it so long?

1230
01:35:47,304 --> 01:35:49,793
- It's worth investigating.
- Yes.

1231
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:53,297
I'm glad you came, Miss Hanson.
You've given me fresh hope.

1232
01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:57,067
You must come with me.
We'll start with the Great Northern.

1233
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:09,635
Please be kind enough to tell the manager
this suitcase is of no interest to me...

1234
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,599
and I'm sorry to have troubled him.

1235
01:36:13,311 --> 01:36:14,675
John Smith.

1236
01:36:15,444 --> 01:36:17,741
Highly unimaginative incognito.

1237
01:36:18,412 --> 01:36:21,607
What could be more anonymous
than these poor rags?

1238
01:36:22,213 --> 01:36:24,737
- Nothing seemed familiar to you?
- No.

1239
01:36:25,314 --> 01:36:28,475
There's a finality
about that most unrewarding find:

1240
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:30,844
Like a door slammed and bolted.

1241
01:36:32,182 --> 01:36:35,047
Now I shall learn to accept myself
for what I am:

1242
01:36:35,117 --> 01:36:39,016
A psychological defective.
As Kitty saw me. As you must see me.

1243
01:36:39,951 --> 01:36:42,544
You must keep my secret, Miss Hanson.

1244
01:36:45,686 --> 01:36:48,778
Will you send a telegram
to the West Lytham Liberal Association...

1245
01:36:48,854 --> 01:36:51,047
telling them
I'll receive the Committee tomorrow?

1246
01:36:51,121 --> 01:36:52,644
Yes, Mr. Rainier.

1247
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:56,620
- There's an express to London at 8:15.
- I'll make reservations.

1248
01:37:38,667 --> 01:37:41,656
Congratulations, Mr. Rainier.
Famous victory.

1249
01:37:41,734 --> 01:37:44,565
The Prime Minister's delighted.
Our new member from Lytham.

1250
01:37:44,635 --> 01:37:46,431
- Yes. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1251
01:37:46,503 --> 01:37:49,595
- It's good to have you with us, sir.
- Thank you.

1252
01:37:51,604 --> 01:37:54,070
- The party is honored, Mr. Rainier.
- Thank you, sir.

1253
01:37:54,138 --> 01:37:57,401
- Mr. Rainier, congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1254
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,937
Miss Hanson.

1255
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:02,433
My compliments, Mr. Rainier.
A great triumph.

1256
01:38:02,507 --> 01:38:03,837
Thank you.

1257
01:38:05,007 --> 01:38:07,940
Have I kept you waiting? I was delayed.

1258
01:38:08,008 --> 01:38:10,167
Nice of you to come down for my debut.

1259
01:38:10,242 --> 01:38:12,641
- Was I satisfactory?
- Very.

1260
01:38:12,843 --> 01:38:15,275
Waiter, some tea, please.

1261
01:38:15,344 --> 01:38:17,071
What would you like? Cake? Sandwiches?

1262
01:38:17,144 --> 01:38:19,304
- Bring an assortment.
- Thank you.

1263
01:38:19,378 --> 01:38:22,776
By the way, I haven't really thanked you
for your help in the campaign.

1264
01:38:22,845 --> 01:38:25,039
I don't know what I should have done
without you.

1265
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:28,307
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Politics interest me.

1266
01:38:29,881 --> 01:38:32,905
Do they? I'm glad of that.

1267
01:38:37,049 --> 01:38:39,038
You're staring at me, you know.

1268
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:43,440
I'm sorry. It struck me
your hair is bright red in the sunshine.

1269
01:38:43,618 --> 01:38:46,949
Was that all?
You were looking so intensely.

1270
01:38:47,152 --> 01:38:51,711
Everyone has these feelings of having
lived through certain moments before.

1271
01:38:52,053 --> 01:38:54,918
You mean, you have the feeling
that you've known me before?

1272
01:38:54,988 --> 01:38:56,749
I had, for a moment.

1273
01:38:57,889 --> 01:39:02,720
As a matter of fact, I felt it quite strongly
the first day you came into my office.

1274
01:39:04,157 --> 01:39:06,056
- You didn't show it.
- No?

1275
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,521
- Is that why you engaged me?
- Perhaps.

1276
01:39:08,591 --> 01:39:11,387
It was also your air of quiet efficiency.

1277
01:39:12,292 --> 01:39:13,758
Forgive me...

1278
01:39:14,692 --> 01:39:18,182
but is there any possibility
that you might marry again?

1279
01:39:18,261 --> 01:39:19,818
Not the slightest.

1280
01:39:20,027 --> 01:39:23,188
I'm asking you
because I have a proposal to make.

1281
01:39:23,796 --> 01:39:26,627
I need your help in my parliamentary life.

1282
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:31,487
- Social secretary?
- Not exactly.

1283
01:39:32,297 --> 01:39:33,661
You know...

1284
01:39:34,465 --> 01:39:37,829
it seemed quite a reasonable idea
when it came to me.

1285
01:39:38,266 --> 01:39:41,097
But now, I'm rather losing my nerve.

1286
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:43,064
Why? Is it so startling?

1287
01:39:43,133 --> 01:39:47,033
It may sound outrageous to you,
but it's not a sudden impulse.

1288
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:50,024
I've thought it over very carefully.

1289
01:39:50,669 --> 01:39:52,862
You and I are in the same boat,
Miss Hanson.

1290
01:39:52,936 --> 01:39:55,267
We're both ghost-ridden.

1291
01:39:55,437 --> 01:39:58,734
That sounds a bit romantic,
but I think it expresses it.

1292
01:39:58,805 --> 01:40:00,998
We are prisoners of our past.

1293
01:40:02,405 --> 01:40:03,463
Yes.

1294
01:40:05,673 --> 01:40:08,469
What if we were to pool our loneliness...

1295
01:40:08,808 --> 01:40:12,969
and give each other what little we have:
Support, friendship?

1296
01:40:15,276 --> 01:40:17,799
I'm proposing marriage, Miss Hanson.

1297
01:40:18,577 --> 01:40:21,135
Or should I call it a merger?

1298
01:40:22,711 --> 01:40:24,939
You know, I'm good at mergers.

1299
01:40:26,112 --> 01:40:29,238
A Member of Parliament
should have a wife, Margaret.

1300
01:40:29,313 --> 01:40:32,746
So I'm told on all sides.
"He needs a clever hostess. "

1301
01:40:32,947 --> 01:40:34,937
You have exceptional gifts.

1302
01:40:35,181 --> 01:40:38,546
Would it interest you
to have a wider field for them?

1303
01:40:39,282 --> 01:40:43,682
You need have no fear that I would make
any emotional demands upon you.

1304
01:40:44,584 --> 01:40:47,573
I have only sincere friendship to offer.

1305
01:40:48,351 --> 01:40:50,579
I won't ask any more from you.

1306
01:40:52,219 --> 01:40:55,879
Please. Don't answer at once.
Think it over.

1307
01:40:56,554 --> 01:40:58,884
It's completely a selfish proposal...

1308
01:40:59,121 --> 01:41:01,519
but I can't have you giving me notice,
you know.

1309
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:03,555
I'd be lost without you.

1310
01:41:04,589 --> 01:41:06,714
Miss Hanson... Margaret...

1311
01:41:07,156 --> 01:41:10,123
- have I hurt you?
- I don't know.

1312
01:41:13,158 --> 01:41:15,886
This comes of boasting that I never cry.

1313
01:41:16,026 --> 01:41:18,356
You will think about it?
I'll call you tomorrow.

1314
01:41:18,426 --> 01:41:21,291
No, I can't wait so long.
Tonight, about 9:00?

1315
01:41:21,494 --> 01:41:23,483
I hope the answer will be yes.

1316
01:41:23,594 --> 01:41:25,151
Here's the tea.

1317
01:41:29,663 --> 01:41:32,993
It wasn't a very flattering proposal, really.

1318
01:41:33,764 --> 01:41:36,196
Rather, a suggestion for a merger.

1319
01:41:37,131 --> 01:41:39,324
He used that very expression.

1320
01:41:41,265 --> 01:41:44,891
- Pretty cold-blooded, isn't it?
- Well, it's honest.

1321
01:41:45,834 --> 01:41:48,665
I'm sorry. Sorry for myself.

1322
01:41:51,068 --> 01:41:54,229
- I want you to be happy, Paula.
- It may work out.

1323
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:59,059
He might even fall in love with me.

1324
01:41:59,370 --> 01:42:01,700
Would that be so very extraordinary?

1325
01:42:02,305 --> 01:42:04,863
It would be very extraordinary if he didn't.

1326
01:42:04,939 --> 01:42:07,667
But the situation is very extraordinary.

1327
01:42:08,739 --> 01:42:11,729
It seems rather hard,
what I'm going to say...

1328
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:15,269
but if you marry him, keep to his terms.

1329
01:42:16,741 --> 01:42:18,640
I suppose you're right.

1330
01:42:20,309 --> 01:42:21,935
And you love him?

1331
01:42:23,643 --> 01:42:24,700
Yes.

1332
01:42:26,311 --> 01:42:28,607
You're going to be hurt, Paula.

1333
01:42:38,547 --> 01:42:40,571
John, don't be against it.

1334
01:42:44,382 --> 01:42:45,541
Hello?

1335
01:42:47,016 --> 01:42:48,642
Yes, Mr. Rainier.

1336
01:42:50,417 --> 01:42:52,907
Charles. You're early.

1337
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,584
It's yes, Charles.

1338
01:43:18,291 --> 01:43:21,747
Isn't that Mrs. Rainier,
who gives those political dinners?

1339
01:43:21,826 --> 01:43:24,986
Lady Rainier.
He was in the birthday honors.

1340
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:27,152
They say he'll be in the Cabinet.

1341
01:43:41,164 --> 01:43:43,824
Pity there's no son to inherit the title.

1342
01:43:43,898 --> 01:43:47,423
Such a wonderful couple.
I hear he's devoted to her.

1343
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:52,114
Well, it's really amazing.
She's got him to dance.

1344
01:44:52,183 --> 01:44:55,548
She's got him to smile, too.
That woman is a marvel.

1345
01:45:05,786 --> 01:45:08,582
Good night, Sheldon, and thank you.
You managed beautifully.

1346
01:45:08,654 --> 01:45:09,814
Thank you, milady.

1347
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:11,946
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- Good night, Mr. Charles.

1348
01:45:12,022 --> 01:45:14,352
You certainly mellowed the old gentleman.

1349
01:45:14,422 --> 01:45:17,082
He was positively purring
when I put him into the car.

1350
01:45:17,156 --> 01:45:19,020
Yes, I think he really enjoyed himself.

1351
01:45:19,091 --> 01:45:21,080
- I know I did.
- Nonsense.

1352
01:45:21,258 --> 01:45:24,419
Good heavens! It's nearly 3:00.
You have two committees tomorrow.

1353
01:45:24,492 --> 01:45:27,186
- Today.
- Yes, that's true. It's nearly morning.

1354
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:30,920
The morning of May 25.
Does that suggest something to you?

1355
01:45:30,994 --> 01:45:34,688
It's the anniversary of our wedding.
Our third anniversary.

1356
01:45:34,895 --> 01:45:38,851
Will you wait just a moment?
You don't look the least bit tired.

1357
01:46:00,434 --> 01:46:02,924
All my gratitude goes with this, Margaret.

1358
01:46:03,003 --> 01:46:05,799
I owe you more than I can put into words.

1359
01:46:10,104 --> 01:46:13,094
It's too beautiful, really. You spoil me.

1360
01:46:13,171 --> 01:46:16,332
The emerald is said to have belonged
to the Empress Marie Louise.

1361
01:46:16,406 --> 01:46:19,168
Really? That's thrilling.

1362
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,397
Will you put it on for me?

1363
01:46:36,645 --> 01:46:39,407
There. How do you like it?

1364
01:46:40,979 --> 01:46:44,140
Do you know
you're a very beautiful woman?

1365
01:46:45,447 --> 01:46:48,902
Thank you. I rather hoped
you thought that.

1366
01:46:49,515 --> 01:46:50,879
Margaret...

1367
01:46:52,082 --> 01:46:54,514
are you happy?

1368
01:46:55,182 --> 01:46:58,047
- Why do you ask?
- A twinge of conscience.

1369
01:46:58,384 --> 01:47:02,249
- Lf I hadn't interfered in your life...
- I should have never been Lady Rainier...

1370
01:47:02,318 --> 01:47:05,752
entertained the Prime Minister,
worn a queen's emerald.

1371
01:47:06,185 --> 01:47:07,583
Is it enough?

1372
01:47:09,754 --> 01:47:10,811
Perhaps not.

1373
01:47:10,887 --> 01:47:13,649
Is there anyone else?

1374
01:47:15,655 --> 01:47:16,679
No.

1375
01:47:18,389 --> 01:47:21,982
- Charles, why are you asking me?
- Because if there were...

1376
01:47:22,057 --> 01:47:26,115
I've often wanted to say this,
I wouldn't hold you to our bargain.

1377
01:47:26,458 --> 01:47:28,219
I haven't the right.

1378
01:47:30,326 --> 01:47:34,816
- You're trying to get rid of me, Charles?
- You know I'd be utterly lost without you.

1379
01:47:35,093 --> 01:47:38,026
I'm glad to hear that,
because I like my job.

1380
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:43,891
A woman told me tonight that she
envied me more than anyone she knew.

1381
01:47:44,596 --> 01:47:46,825
She envied me my husband, Charles.

1382
01:47:47,163 --> 01:47:48,652
Most women do.

1383
01:47:49,997 --> 01:47:51,623
Now I really am tired.

1384
01:47:51,698 --> 01:47:54,722
Good night, Charles,
and thank you for the wonderful present.

1385
01:47:54,799 --> 01:47:56,322
Good night, Margaret.

1386
01:48:44,545 --> 01:48:45,773
Smithy!

1387
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:04,044
Margaret, I'm afraid
I said something to hurt you.

1388
01:49:05,818 --> 01:49:07,375
No, Charles.

1389
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:13,648
If I expressed myself clumsily...

1390
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:18,381
- It's nothing, really. It's just that...
- I wish you would be frank with me.

1391
01:49:24,423 --> 01:49:25,582
Do you?

1392
01:49:35,192 --> 01:49:36,852
Were those a gift?

1393
01:49:38,493 --> 01:49:39,550
Yes.

1394
01:49:40,061 --> 01:49:42,550
I came across them quite by chance.

1395
01:49:43,728 --> 01:49:45,251
They're just cheap little beads.

1396
01:49:45,329 --> 01:49:48,592
But they have a value for you
that this does not?

1397
01:49:52,064 --> 01:49:54,758
He said they were the color of my eyes.

1398
01:49:58,932 --> 01:50:00,796
They are, aren't they?

1399
01:50:01,566 --> 01:50:02,759
Oh, Margaret.

1400
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:06,891
Isn't there something morbid
in burying one's heart with the dead?

1401
01:50:07,735 --> 01:50:10,792
- That's a strange thing for you to say.
- Is it?

1402
01:50:11,669 --> 01:50:13,658
You haven't even a memory.

1403
01:50:15,837 --> 01:50:16,860
No.

1404
01:50:17,537 --> 01:50:19,436
And the best of you...

1405
01:50:20,271 --> 01:50:22,363
Your capacity for loving...

1406
01:50:22,806 --> 01:50:27,205
your joy in living is buried
in a little space of time you've forgotten.

1407
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:31,468
- It isn't quite the same thing.
- Why not?

1408
01:50:32,408 --> 01:50:36,841
Because in some vague way, I still have...

1409
01:50:37,209 --> 01:50:39,903
- Hope?
- Yes, I suppose that's it.

1410
01:50:40,644 --> 01:50:42,610
Have you, Charles?

1411
01:50:44,211 --> 01:50:47,303
Do you feel that there really is someone?

1412
01:50:48,813 --> 01:50:51,041
That someday you may find her?

1413
01:50:52,213 --> 01:50:54,577
I'd rather not talk of it, Margaret.

1414
01:50:54,647 --> 01:50:57,113
It's nothing I could put into words.

1415
01:50:57,181 --> 01:50:59,909
But doesn't it frighten you sometimes...

1416
01:51:00,415 --> 01:51:02,608
that the years are passing...

1417
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:07,349
that you may sometime find that
you've lost your capacity for happiness?

1418
01:51:09,185 --> 01:51:11,913
You may have come so near her.

1419
01:51:13,019 --> 01:51:15,679
You may even have brushed by her
in the street.

1420
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:17,776
Yes, I've thought of that.

1421
01:51:20,554 --> 01:51:23,146
You might even have met her, Charles.

1422
01:51:23,388 --> 01:51:25,412
Met her and not known her.

1423
01:51:27,322 --> 01:51:29,516
It might be someone you know.

1424
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:34,414
Charles, it might even be me.

1425
01:51:37,058 --> 01:51:38,524
Oh, Margaret.

1426
01:51:40,393 --> 01:51:42,518
I know I'm talking wildly.

1427
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,086
- It's after 3:00, and I'm tired.
- Yes.

1428
01:51:47,428 --> 01:51:52,088
I've sometimes thought I'd like to travel.
I feel I need a change and a rest.

1429
01:51:52,529 --> 01:51:55,690
- To travel?
- Yes. I've never been out of England.

1430
01:51:55,896 --> 01:52:00,694
I'd like to go to Buenos Aires or Rio
or somewhere colorful and distracting.

1431
01:52:00,798 --> 01:52:02,321
Perhaps when the House adjourns...

1432
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,662
I don't want to drag you away.
I'll take a maid. Or a friend, perhaps.

1433
01:52:12,735 --> 01:52:16,429
Margaret, I believe
you want to get away from me.

1434
01:52:16,602 --> 01:52:17,660
No.

1435
01:52:18,903 --> 01:52:21,335
It's just that it's been a strain.

1436
01:52:22,437 --> 01:52:26,598
I'm just a little nobody, you know.
It's been harder than I thought...

1437
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:29,671
being the wife of Charles Rainier.

1438
01:52:32,774 --> 01:52:34,831
If you wish, of course.

1439
01:52:35,341 --> 01:52:37,204
You are a little overtired, I think.

1440
01:52:37,274 --> 01:52:41,071
- Shall we talk about it in the morning?
- In the morning, yes.

1441
01:52:41,709 --> 01:52:44,608
- Good night, Margaret.
- Good night, Charles.

1442
01:52:59,814 --> 01:53:01,007
Smithy.

1443
01:53:37,391 --> 01:53:39,688
I think this is my compartment.

1444
01:53:40,458 --> 01:53:41,822
Yes, it is.

1445
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:49,157
I hope Harrison
has made everything smooth for you.

1446
01:53:49,228 --> 01:53:51,751
Thanks. Yes, he's been very helpful.

1447
01:53:51,962 --> 01:53:55,395
He should be here any moment
with my letter of credit.

1448
01:53:57,763 --> 01:54:00,389
Will you have only two days
in the country?

1449
01:54:00,497 --> 01:54:03,055
Yes. My boat sails on Wednesday.

1450
01:54:05,831 --> 01:54:09,595
- It's on your way, this place.
- No. It's in Devon.

1451
01:54:10,033 --> 01:54:11,897
It's a quiet little country village...

1452
01:54:11,967 --> 01:54:14,866
with a delightful old inn.
I wanted to see it again.

1453
01:54:16,801 --> 01:54:18,927
I was once very happy there.

1454
01:54:25,103 --> 01:54:27,729
I'm glad I'm not late. Hello, sir.

1455
01:54:27,804 --> 01:54:31,465
I made you out an itinerary.
I thought you'd like to study it on the ship.

1456
01:54:31,539 --> 01:54:33,096
How kind of you.

1457
01:54:33,172 --> 01:54:35,662
- Here's your letter of credit.
- Thank you.

1458
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:39,173
And some magazines.
I'll put these in the compartment.

1459
01:54:40,441 --> 01:54:42,431
I think you'll find everything in order.

1460
01:54:42,509 --> 01:54:44,532
- I hope you have a wonderful trip.
- Thank you.

1461
01:54:44,609 --> 01:54:45,700
Don't stay away too long.

1462
01:54:45,776 --> 01:54:47,834
If I do, blame your excellent arrangements.

1463
01:54:47,910 --> 01:54:49,535
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1464
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:52,975
I'll wait for you, sir.
I have a message from Mr. Chetwynd.

1465
01:54:56,246 --> 01:54:58,439
Well, goodbye, Charles.

1466
01:54:58,713 --> 01:55:01,737
Margaret, I wish you weren't going.

1467
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:04,745
I don't feel quite happy about it.

1468
01:55:05,281 --> 01:55:08,146
- You'll let me hear from you?
- Of course.

1469
01:55:08,948 --> 01:55:10,175
Goodbye.

1470
01:55:21,519 --> 01:55:25,282
- You're going to the house?
- No, to the office. There's some trouble.

1471
01:55:29,055 --> 01:55:32,419
Seems strange not to talk it over
with you, Margaret.

1472
01:55:46,225 --> 01:55:48,521
This strike, sir, it's pretty serious.

1473
01:55:48,592 --> 01:55:49,956
Strike?

1474
01:55:50,026 --> 01:55:53,460
At the Melbridge Cable Works.
The men are out of hand.

1475
01:55:54,494 --> 01:55:56,517
Melbridge. Yes, of course.

1476
01:56:10,099 --> 01:56:14,123
It's all right, men. We've got our terms.

1477
01:56:14,599 --> 01:56:18,124
The strike is settled, and we've won!

1478
01:56:25,369 --> 01:56:27,336
Thanks to one man:

1479
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:29,763
Sir Charles Rainier!

1480
01:57:03,579 --> 01:57:05,773
First back streets we came through.

1481
01:57:05,847 --> 01:57:08,507
Here. Let's pop in here
for a whiskey and soda.

1482
01:57:18,350 --> 01:57:21,146
Thank you kindly, sir. We appreciate it.

1483
01:57:21,484 --> 01:57:24,713
- What will you have, gents?
- Two double McWhirters and soda, please.

1484
01:57:24,785 --> 01:57:27,843
Two double Macs. Right-o, sir.
Here we are, sir.

1485
01:57:33,388 --> 01:57:35,013
Is that the proprietor?

1486
01:57:36,055 --> 01:57:39,112
Yes, sir. That's the Biffer.
Was, I should say.

1487
01:57:39,189 --> 01:57:42,179
He ain't much like that now.
That's him at the end.

1488
01:57:42,256 --> 01:57:44,745
He was a gentleman, the gunner was.

1489
01:57:44,824 --> 01:57:48,258
Not like these softies
what call theirselves heavyweights today.

1490
01:57:48,325 --> 01:57:50,791
Why, he'd take two of them for breakfast!

1491
01:57:51,059 --> 01:57:53,685
He didn't wear no fancy dressing gown...

1492
01:57:56,927 --> 01:57:59,587
Well, we mustn't lose our train.
We better go.

1493
01:57:59,894 --> 01:58:01,360
Thank you, sir.

1494
01:58:06,297 --> 01:58:09,127
- The fog's getting thicker.
- Yes. Beastly.

1495
01:58:10,098 --> 01:58:12,326
- Cigarette?
- Sorry. I don't smoke.

1496
01:58:12,398 --> 01:58:13,455
Of course not.

1497
01:58:13,531 --> 01:58:17,124
Never mind. There's a little tobacconist
just around the corner.

1498
01:58:31,536 --> 01:58:32,729
Well?

1499
01:58:34,437 --> 01:58:37,495
- Packet of Barclay Blue Ribbons, please.
- Yes, sir.

1500
01:58:39,238 --> 01:58:40,636
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

1501
01:58:40,705 --> 01:58:42,899
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1502
01:58:53,809 --> 01:58:56,105
I thought you said
you'd never been in Melbridge.

1503
01:58:56,176 --> 01:58:57,437
I haven't.

1504
01:58:57,510 --> 01:59:01,273
But you said, "There's a little tobacconist
just around the corner. "

1505
01:59:01,678 --> 01:59:04,907
You said, "There's a little tobacconist
just around the corner. "

1506
01:59:04,979 --> 01:59:06,206
I said that?

1507
01:59:06,279 --> 01:59:07,836
That shop was off the main street.

1508
01:59:07,912 --> 01:59:11,368
You couldn't have seen it
on your way from the station.

1509
01:59:12,481 --> 01:59:13,674
No.

1510
01:59:14,515 --> 01:59:16,481
Then how did you know of it?

1511
01:59:20,183 --> 01:59:23,741
- I don't know.
- You went straight to it.

1512
01:59:23,817 --> 01:59:26,909
I did know, but I don't know how.

1513
01:59:28,451 --> 01:59:31,885
- Melbridge.
- What's the matter?

1514
01:59:32,953 --> 01:59:34,283
Melbridge.

1515
01:59:34,954 --> 01:59:37,386
Are you ill, sir? Let me get a cab.

1516
01:59:37,454 --> 01:59:39,647
No, let me think. There's something.

1517
01:59:41,122 --> 01:59:42,588
That shop...

1518
01:59:43,323 --> 01:59:44,948
That woman.

1519
01:59:48,691 --> 01:59:50,919
There's a taxi. I'll get it.

1520
02:00:08,662 --> 02:00:10,322
Here you are, sir.

1521
02:00:12,797 --> 02:00:15,923
Where is the hospital?

1522
02:00:16,698 --> 02:00:19,290
You mean the old one or the new one, sir?

1523
02:00:19,365 --> 02:00:21,161
The old one, I think.

1524
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:24,722
It's on a hill.

1525
02:00:25,367 --> 02:00:26,765
Big gates...

1526
02:00:27,334 --> 02:00:29,358
a high wall all around it.

1527
02:00:30,735 --> 02:00:33,566
That don't sound much like either of them.

1528
02:00:35,203 --> 02:00:38,226
You wouldn't be meaning the asylum,
would you, sir?

1529
02:00:43,339 --> 02:00:44,930
Look here, sir.

1530
02:00:45,272 --> 02:00:47,603
You say you came out of these gates?

1531
02:00:47,673 --> 02:00:49,536
Yes. I'm sure of that.

1532
02:00:49,807 --> 02:00:54,070
There was some excitement
and a great deal of noise.

1533
02:00:54,375 --> 02:00:56,000
Then let's start from here.

1534
02:00:56,075 --> 02:00:58,167
Try and retrace your steps.

1535
02:00:59,176 --> 02:01:00,233
Now.

1536
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:04,435
You must have gone into town.

1537
02:01:04,511 --> 02:01:07,069
Yes, I'd been to that shop.

1538
02:01:07,879 --> 02:01:10,869
Perhaps as we go,
you can piece the thing together.

1539
02:01:10,945 --> 02:01:13,878
Yes, that's right. That's a good idea.

1540
02:01:13,946 --> 02:01:15,776
I came along this path.

1541
02:01:15,847 --> 02:01:18,370
- You remember that?
- Yes, I think so.

1542
02:01:18,815 --> 02:01:21,247
There was a good deal of fog...

1543
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:24,009
and people shouting, and the sound of...

1544
02:01:26,049 --> 02:01:28,243
Like I was trying to get away
from something...

1545
02:01:28,317 --> 02:01:29,943
trying to escape.

1546
02:01:30,217 --> 02:01:33,776
There was some danger, and I was afraid.

1547
02:01:34,185 --> 02:01:35,447
I was...

1548
02:01:35,919 --> 02:01:37,545
There was a girl.

1549
02:01:41,821 --> 02:01:44,253
Yes, there was a girl!

1550
02:02:00,793 --> 02:02:02,282
The mist is lifting.

1551
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:05,589
Yes. It looks as if it will be
a nice day after all.

1552
02:02:07,494 --> 02:02:10,427
Could you take the luggage
to the station and wait for me?

1553
02:02:10,495 --> 02:02:12,462
I've lots of time. I think I'd like to walk.

1554
02:02:12,529 --> 02:02:15,519
Right you are, ma'am.
I'll wait for you by the newsstand.

1555
02:02:15,596 --> 02:02:18,529
You're leaving us now?
I do hope you'll come and see us again.

1556
02:02:18,597 --> 02:02:20,756
Not very soon, I'm afraid.

1557
02:02:20,831 --> 02:02:24,821
- I'm sailing for South America at 2:00.
- You are? My, I envy you.

1558
02:02:24,899 --> 02:02:27,162
Are you sure
you'd prefer to walk to the station?

1559
02:02:27,233 --> 02:02:29,927
Yes. Such a pretty walk.

1560
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:33,165
I used to live here, you know, years ago.

1561
02:02:33,234 --> 02:02:35,565
Mrs. Deventer's time. Did you know her?

1562
02:02:35,636 --> 02:02:38,364
No, not very well.
She died three years ago.

1563
02:02:38,436 --> 02:02:39,732
So Albert was telling me.

1564
02:02:39,804 --> 02:02:43,464
She was quite a character, Mrs. Deventer.
Lots of people ask after her.

1565
02:02:43,538 --> 02:02:45,834
There was a gentleman in here
a few minutes ago...

1566
02:02:45,905 --> 02:02:47,872
asking after Mrs. Deventer
and the old vicar.

1567
02:02:47,939 --> 02:02:50,701
Really? I should be going.
I don't want to have to hurry.

1568
02:02:50,772 --> 02:02:52,170
Goodbye, Miss Barnes. Thank you.

1569
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:55,468
- I'm sure you'll have a wonderful trip.
- Thank you.

1570
02:03:01,942 --> 02:03:05,000
Did you say a gentleman
was asking for Mrs. Deventer?

1571
02:03:05,076 --> 02:03:07,269
Yes, miss, and the old vicar.

1572
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:10,204
That's Mr. Durham, you know.
He lives at Seven Oaks.

1573
02:03:10,278 --> 02:03:12,302
Mr. Pauly's our vicar now.

1574
02:03:12,711 --> 02:03:14,871
- Is the gentleman staying here?
- No.

1575
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:20,443
He was looking for a cottage.
Said he used to rent one here years ago.

1576
02:03:21,181 --> 02:03:23,773
He remembered it was near the church.

1577
02:03:24,215 --> 02:03:26,511
Was he a friend of yours, miss?

1578
02:03:28,349 --> 02:03:29,679
Excuse me.

1579
02:05:11,411 --> 02:05:12,604
Smithy?

1580
02:05:21,746 --> 02:05:23,110
Oh, Smithy!

1581
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:33,248
Darling!

1582
02:05:34,116 --> 02:05:35,309
Paula!

1583
02:05:36,305 --> 02:06:36,214
