1
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,097
Tutti-frutti.

2
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:32,761
Most generous gift
from American sergeant.

3
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:37,967
Lovely ladies, kind gentlemen,
pleased to introduce myself.

4
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:42,304
Sakini by name,
interpreter by profession.

5
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:45,610
Education by the ancient dictionary.

6
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:50,722
Okinawan by whim of gods.

7
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:56,662
History of Okinawa reveal
distinguished record of conquerors.

8
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:03,065
We have honor to be subjugated
in 14th century by Chinese pirates.

9
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:06,069
In 16th century, by English missionary.

10
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,174
In 18th century, by Japanese warlords.

11
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:13,403
And in 20th century,
by American Marine.

12
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,878
Okinawa very fortunate.

13
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,383
Culture brought to us.
Not have to leave home for it.

14
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:23,613
And we learn many thing.

15
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,251
Most important, that rest of world
not like Okinawa.

16
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:34,264
World filled with delightful variation.
Example:

17
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:37,665
In Okinawa, no locks on doors.

18
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:40,601
Bad manners not to trust neighbors.

19
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:44,676
In America, lock and key big industry.

20
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:49,611
Conclusion: Bad manners, good business.

21
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:52,742
Another example:

22
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,118
In Okinawa, wash self in public bath
with nude lady quite proper...

23
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:02,318
...but a picture of nude lady
in private home quite improper.

24
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:07,125
In America, statue of nude lady in park
win prize...

25
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,795
...but nude lady in flesh in park
win a penalty.

26
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:14,496
Conclusion:

27
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:19,134
Pornography, question of geography.

28
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:24,311
But Okinawa most eager
to be educated by conquerors.

29
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,952
Not easy to learn.

30
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,578
Sometimes very painful.

31
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:33,885
But pain make man think.

32
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:37,319
Thought make man wise.

33
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:41,092
And wisdom make life endurable.

34
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:44,633
So now...

35
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:50,037
Now we going to tell you little story
to demonstrate splendid example...

36
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,943
...of benevolent assimilation of democracy
by Okinawa.

37
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,174
Boss by name of Colonel Purdy III.

38
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:04,553
Number three after name indicate
he is son of a son of a son.

39
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,619
Colonel Purdy put up many sign.

40
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:10,355
This exceedingly civilized.

41
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,864
Make it very easy for uncivilized
to know what not to do.

42
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:17,798
Here laundry of officer...

43
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:21,668
...not to fraternize with laundry
of enlisted man.

44
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:31,408
This gentleman,
honorable Sergeant Gregovich...

45
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:37,079
...assistant to Colonel Purdy,
but not a son of a son of son.

46
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,556
You know what he's doing? Explanation:

47
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:45,289
Colonel Purdy great student of history.

48
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:47,899
So every month, wife of Colonel Purdy...

49
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,763
<i>...send him magazine
called Adventure Magazine.</i>

50
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:54,634
Cover have picture of pirate
with a black patch over eye.

51
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:57,241
Everyone try to steal magazine.

52
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,208
So colonel hide under desk
so he can read first...

53
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,905
...but the sergeant always find.

54
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:17,085
He's a smart mouse.

55
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:28,540
This gentleman,
exalted boss Colonel Purdy III.

56
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,903
Colonel very wise man.

57
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:35,309
Every morning look up at the sky
and make a prophecy.

58
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,409
It's not gonna rain today.

59
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:42,248
And you know what? Not... Not rain.

60
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:47,951
Of course it not rain this time of year
in whole history of Okinawa...

61
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:50,254
...but the colonel not make mistake.

62
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:58,302
Explanation: Army teach colonel French
for invasion of Europe...

63
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:01,099
...then send to Okinawa instead.

64
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:06,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

65
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:08,978
Where's my 8th pair of shorts?

66
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:12,709
Now colonel gonna yell loud for Sakini.

67
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:16,685
So I hide. I pretend
to be asleep here. So...

68
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:18,255
Sakini.

69
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:22,190
Sakini? Sakini?

70
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:24,159
Sakini!

71
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,601
Sakini!

72
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:32,727
- Sakini.
- Oh, good morning, boss.

73
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:34,202
You sure surprised me, boss.

74
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:38,140
I want you to tell me why my laundry comes
back every week with one piece missing.

75
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:41,280
- Gets lost, boss.
- I know it gets lost.

76
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:43,779
What I wanna find out
is how it gets lost.

77
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,815
Oh, very simple, boss.

78
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:48,749
Family take laundry
to wash in the stream...

79
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:53,381
...and while friends exchange greetings,
laundry exchange places.

80
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:56,960
We run down hill fast as dickens
to catch laundry, boss.

81
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,997
- Well?
- Not run fast enough.

82
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,834
No wonder you people were subjugated
by the Japanese.

83
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:06,870
If you're not sleeping,
you're running away from work.

84
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,302
Where's your get-up-and-go?

85
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:11,969
Guess get-up-and-go went, boss.

86
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:16,138
Well, get up and go down to the officers'
quarters and see if Captain Fisby's arrived.

87
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:19,113
If he has, tell him to report to me
at once. Hurry.

88
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:21,276
- Sakini.
- Yes, boss?

89
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:24,514
You are a civilian employee in the pay
of the United States Army...

90
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:26,488
...and should dress accordingly.
- Yeah.

91
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:28,524
Pull your socks up.

92
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:31,728
Very sorry, boss. Very sorry.

93
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:36,062
- Socks up. Anything more, boss?
- That'll be all.

94
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:39,729
Is that as fast as you can walk?

95
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:44,434
No, no, boss, but to walk any faster,
socks fall down.

96
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:51,611
- Good morning, sir.
- At ease.

97
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:54,981
I'm gonna get rid of that interpreter.
He doesn't set a good example.

98
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:59,591
Colonel, sir, we gotta have someone around
who speaks the language.

99
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,428
You're quite right, sergeant, quite right.

100
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,586
It isn't often I make a mistake.
When I do...

101
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:07,255
- It's a beaut?
- I wasn't going to say that.

102
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,368
- I was gonna say, "By George, I admit it."
- I'm sorry, sir.

103
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:12,936
Now, we've got a new officer
reporting this morning.

104
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:16,439
He's been transferred to us
from Psychological Warfare.

105
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,770
I don't suppose you happen to know
who they are.

106
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:21,937
Aren't they something at the rear
of the rear echelon?

107
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,709
They're just the cream
of the Army's geniuses.

108
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:27,318
They're just the brains
behind the fighting heart.

109
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,456
Every man Jack of them has a mind
like a steel trap.

110
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,784
We're lucky to be getting
one of their officers.

111
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,019
- I'll watch my step, sir.
- While we're waiting for Captain Fisby...

112
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:38,527
...l'd like you to make a note
of new signs I want.

113
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:41,633
The painter hasn't finished the ones
you ordered yesterday, sir.

114
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,895
There's only one answer to that:
Put on another sign painter.

115
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:46,299
Yes, sir.

116
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:51,307
Now, I noticed the men were dancing with
each other in the canteen the other night.

117
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:54,605
Yes, sir. "No dancing allowed."

118
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:57,773
I didn't say that, Gregovich.
I don't object to the men dancing.

119
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,681
I want them to enjoy themselves. It doesn't
set a good example for the natives...

120
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:04,516
...to see noncoms
dancing with enlisted men.

121
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,487
So have a sign posted saying:

122
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:10,527
"Sergeants are forbidden
to dance with privates."

123
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:14,798
You might as well take that memo
to the sign painter.

124
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:16,400
Yes, sir.

125
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,616
- Sakini here, boss.
- Don't ever put your finger on an officer.

126
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:39,155
- Oh, not all right, boss?
- No.

127
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,021
If you want to announce
your presence, knock.

128
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:45,289
Can't you natives ever learn anything
about custom?

129
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:49,795
What do you think you're doing?

130
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:53,234
Oh, not know, boss. Do what you ask.

131
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:56,671
Everything in this country
conspires to annoy me.

132
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:59,243
Well, where is Captain Fisby?

133
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:04,315
Oh, he come now, boss. I run ahead.
Socks fall down.

134
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:08,816
Captain Fisby reporting, sir.

135
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:12,253
Welcome to Team 147.

136
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:15,223
- I can't tell you how glad I am to have you.
- Thank you, sir.

137
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:17,794
Frankly, we're so desperate
for officer personnel...

138
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:21,764
...l'd be glad to see you
even if you had two heads.

139
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:23,959
That'll be all, Sakini.
You can wait outside.

140
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:26,969
- Okay.
- Sit down, captain, sit down.

141
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:32,167
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Oh, sorry, boss. I sit by door, boss.

142
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:34,575
- May as well be comfortable here.
- Yes.

143
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:35,873
Not sleep.

144
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,077
Have you unpacked?

145
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:40,811
Oh, yes, sir. I unpacked
as soon as I got in last night.

146
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:43,922
Well, that's too bad
because you'll have to pack again.

147
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,320
I am sending you to Tobiki at once.

148
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,756
We need a man of your caliber
up there right away.

149
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:50,520
- Well, thank you.
- I am informed...

150
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:54,564
...that you requested this transfer
from Psychological Warfare to my outfit.

151
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,759
- May I say that I am honored.
- Yeah.

152
00:11:56,936 --> 00:12:01,896
Well, in all fairness, sir, I think I should
tell you that I was requested to request it.

153
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:04,908
Oh, may I ask why?

154
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:06,908
Well, you see, sir...

155
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,345
...it seems that my... My propaganda
to undermine the enemy's morale...

156
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:14,486
...undermined the staff's morale instead.

157
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:17,487
How did you get into Psychological Warfare
in the first place?

158
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:20,785
- I was requested to request a transfer.
- From what?

159
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,293
- The Paymaster General's office.
- What was your duty there?

160
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:31,060
Well, I had charge
of the payroll-computation machine.

161
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:34,001
Well, until...

162
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:37,336
- Until what?
- Well...

163
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:41,075
You know, machines have always been
my mortal enemy, colonel.

164
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:44,080
I don't believe that they're inanimate.
They're not inanimate.

165
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,777
- They're full of malice and ill will.
- I asked you what happened, captain.

166
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:49,546
Yes. Yes, sir.

167
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:53,317
Well, this machine... This... You know,
the payroll-computation machine?

168
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:55,357
It made a mistake, it seems...

169
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:58,554
...of a quarter of a million dollars
in the payroll.

170
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:03,566
And unfortunately, the men were paid
before the mistake was discovered.

171
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:08,537
- What did they do to you?
- Oh, they gave me a job licking envelopes.

172
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,506
- And then you asked for a transfer.
- No.

173
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:14,009
I developed an allergy to glue.

174
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:19,175
How many outfits in this man's Army
have you been in, captain?

175
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,048
- Let's see, how many are there now, sir?
- Never mind.

176
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:25,315
I admit disappointment, but not defeat.

177
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:28,654
I thought you were given to me
in recognition of my work here.

178
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:32,355
Frankly, I expect to be made
a general soon.

179
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:36,228
And I want that star
for my wife's crown.

180
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:39,963
- Naturally, that's very hush-hush.
- Oh, yes, naturally.

181
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:43,006
Do you know something, sir?
Do you know something?

182
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:46,872
I just think that perhaps I just wasn't
cut out to be a soldier, that's all.

183
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:51,608
Captain, none of us was cut out
to be a soldier, but we do the job.

184
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:55,311
We adjust, we adapt,
we roll with a punch...

185
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:58,218
...and bring victory home in our teeth.

186
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:02,551
Do you know what I was
before the war?

187
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:04,593
A football coach?

188
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:08,356
I was the Purdy Paper Box Company
of Pottawatomie.

189
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,058
What did I know about foreigners?

190
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:13,069
But my job is to teach these natives
the meaning of democracy.

191
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:16,504
And they're gonna learn democracy
if I have to shoot every one of them.

192
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:20,705
- Yes, sir.
- What did you do before the war?

193
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,077
Oh, I was an associate professor
at Muncie.

194
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,242
- What'd you teach?
- The humanities.

195
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:29,980
Captain, you're finally getting a job
you're qualified by training to handle:

196
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:33,717
- Teaching these natives to act human.
- I don't think the humanities are that.

197
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:36,157
If you can teach one thing,
you can teach another.

198
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:39,525
This is plan B. Washington has drawn up
full instructions...

199
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:42,997
...pertaining to the welfare and recovery
of these native villages.

200
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:47,196
- Consider it your Bible, captain.
- Yes, sir. I'll study it very carefully.

201
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:49,466
There might be some questions
I'd like to ask.

202
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,735
Washington has anticipated
all your questions.

203
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:54,505
- Yes, but I was thinking...
- You don't even have to think.

204
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,672
This document relieves you
of that responsibility.

205
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:01,484
- How is your Japanese?
- Oh, not so very good.

206
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:04,680
- No, no. Not good, sir.
- Oh, I can see you'll need an interpreter.

207
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:06,449
Well, l... No, no... Sir...

208
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,559
- I've got just the man for you.
- Colonel?

209
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:09,955
- Colonel?
- Sakini!

210
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,064
- I could study the language, you know.
- No need, we won the war.

211
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:15,291
Sakini present, boss.
Socks up, not sleeping.

212
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:18,096
Sakini, this is Captain Fisby.

213
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,568
- We meet before, boss, you forget.
- Yeah, we met.

214
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,764
I'm assigning you to Captain Fisby.

215
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,604
He's gonna take charge of a village
at the top of Okinawa.

216
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:29,214
- A village called Tobiki.
- Tobiki, boss.

217
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:32,817
Very nice place, boss,
but not at top of Okinawa, at bottom.

218
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:35,818
Don't tell me where the villages
under my command are located.

219
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:38,786
- I happen to give a course in map reading.
- Very sorry, boss.

220
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,358
But happen to be born in Tobiki.
It's at the bottom.

221
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:44,963
Then it's time you learned
where you were born.

222
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:47,998
Oh, very sorry, boss,
but the map upside down.

223
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,498
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

224
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:52,899
Why doesn't the army learn
how to draw a map properly?

225
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:54,562
That'll be all, Sakini.

226
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,868
Find Sergeant Gregovich and have him
assign a jeep to Captain Fisby.

227
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:01,069
Load supplies and the captain's gear.
You'll be leaving at once.

228
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:06,310
I mention you in prayer to gods, boss.
I wait for you in jeep, captain.

229
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:13,155
I sometimes think we occupation teams
have it tougher than combat troops.

230
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:16,453
- Oh, now, I wouldn't say that, sir.
- They have it rough for a while.

231
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:19,757
But we have the killing daily grind
with no glory in it.

232
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:21,593
Yes, sir, I know what you mean, sir.

233
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:25,533
Life itself is a battlefield
with its own obscure heroes.

234
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:29,606
- I consider that poetry, captain.
- Oh, no, no, that's prose, colonel.

235
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:34,075
And it isn't mine, you know.
It's Victor Hugo.

236
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:38,376
<i>Yes, Victor Hugo.
How I loved Tale of Two Cities.</i>

237
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:41,884
Isn't that Dickens?
Isn't that Dickens, sir?

238
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:45,023
Well, to get back to Tobiki.
Your first job when you get there...

239
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:48,388
...will be to establish a municipal
government and to build a school.

240
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:51,189
Plan B calls for the schoolhouse
to be pentagon-shaped.

241
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:53,331
- Penta...?
- When the schoolhouse is built...

242
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:56,297
...you will organize a Ladies League
for Democratic Action.

243
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:57,958
Captain...

244
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:01,231
...this is a chance for you
to make a name for yourself.

245
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,136
Yes, sir, I feel that I personally...

246
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:06,642
...have delayed victory at least a year,
and I want to vindicate myself.

247
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:08,609
That's the kind of talk I like to hear.

248
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:10,840
- Thank you.
- Well, I won't detain you then.

249
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:12,984
- Yes, sir.
- My only order to you is...

250
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:15,052
...put that village on the map.

251
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:16,443
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:19,022
Send me a bimonthly progress report
in triplicate.

253
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,159
- Yes, sir.
- Don't duplicate your work.

254
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:22,555
No, sir. No, sir.

255
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:26,164
And remember that the eyes of Washington
are on our occupation teams...

256
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:28,459
...and the eyes of the world
are on Washington.

257
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:31,626
- Yes, sir. I'll keep the eyes in mind, sir.
- Goodbye, captain.

258
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:34,705
Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir.

259
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:40,306
Everything all set? We go Tobiki now?

260
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,344
Listen, I gotta get my gear
packed first.

261
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:45,915
All finished, boss.
I have many cousin work for Army.

262
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:48,553
- Where's our jeep?
- Right over there, boss.

263
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:58,526
- What's she doing up there?
- Oh, she nice old lady, boss.

264
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:02,292
She hear we go to Tobiki village,
so she think she go along to visit grandson.

265
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:05,635
She does? Well...

266
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,567
Well, you tell her I'm very sorry...

267
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,140
...but, you see,
this is against regulations.

268
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,869
Oh, she not fall off, boss.
She tied on good.

269
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:14,774
Yes. Well, you untie her, Sakini.

270
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:17,541
Just get up there and untie her
and tell her to get down.

271
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:21,117
You see, she's going to have to find
some other way to visit her grandson.

272
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:23,778
Boss, her grandson mayor
of Tobiki village.

273
00:18:23,956 --> 00:18:26,925
You gonna make him lose face
you kick old grandma off jeep.

274
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:31,390
- You say she's the mayor's grandmother?
- Yes.

275
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:35,226
Well, all right. You see...
She's tied on all right, I guess, huh?

276
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,369
- So I guess we can take her.
- Sure.

277
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:42,599
- Now, look, is all this stuff here mine?
- No, most of the stuff belong to old lady.

278
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,902
She gonna stay three or four months...

279
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:50,447
...so she bring her cooking pots and bed
and a present for friend and...

280
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,277
Well, I don't... I don't... All right.

281
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:56,478
Look, if you see any low branches coming,
you just... You know, you yell out.

282
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:58,987
And... Get in there, Sakini.

283
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:02,525
You get in there, and give me directions
while I drive. You wanna get in?

284
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:05,960
No, no, can't go yet.
Old lady daughter not here, boss.

285
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:08,656
Wait a minute,
maybe I didn't hear you right. You say...

286
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,927
You don't mean the daughter
is coming with us.

287
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:14,539
Well, old lady very old, boss.
Who gonna take care of her on the trip?

288
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:17,437
Oh, here she come now, boss.
Right on dot.

289
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,043
I don't... Listen...

290
00:19:20,913 --> 00:19:24,849
Will you just wait a minute?
Now, wait a minute, will you mind?

291
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:26,382
Tell her... Miss...

292
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:30,147
Sakini, will you tell her that there's no room
for anything more on this jeep.

293
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:32,722
Old lady must take clothes
to show friends, boss...

294
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:36,258
...because you make her lose face
if people think she only got one dress.

295
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:38,919
Miss, will you please come back?
Ask her to come back.

296
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:41,726
There's no room for any more bundles
on this jeep.

297
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,064
No, she not go get bundles, boss,
she go get children.

298
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:48,331
- Sakini. Sakini.
- What?

299
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:51,533
Look, these things
are always happening to me.

300
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,235
And I've gotta put a stop to them
someplace.

301
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:58,406
Daughter not go without children,
and old lady not go without daughter.

302
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:02,748
And if old lady not go,
mayor of Tobiki be mad with you, boss.

303
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,322
Will you wait just a minute please?

304
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:10,754
Don't get up on there.
Not on the hood of the...

305
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:15,093
Just a minute. Son. Son.
Please don't... Son.

306
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:19,567
Sakini, for Pete's sakes, how does
she expect me to see how to drive?

307
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:21,831
Oh, old lady got very good eyesight,
boss.

308
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,168
She gonna sit up there
and tell us when to turn.

309
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,675
You'll have to move over here, son,
because l...

310
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:29,473
Son, will you please stop...?
If you're gonna...

311
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:31,138
What?

312
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,316
What? What?

313
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:36,784
- Oh, he... He going to get goat, boss.
- Goat?

314
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:39,549
- You can't leave goat behind, boss.
- Just a minute!

315
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:44,662
Hold it, everybody. Now, we're gonna see
who is going to lose face right now.

316
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,322
And we're gonna see because no goat
is going to ride on this jeep.

317
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,094
- Oh, you not like goat, boss?
- No. No. No.

318
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,707
Yes, I like... I mean, I don't know... It's not
a question of whether I like the goat.

319
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:59,742
It's... I'm just sure that the colonel,
he wouldn't like it.

320
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:02,847
Oh, well, the children not go
without goat, boss.

321
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:05,879
- Mother not go without children.
- Yeah.

322
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:08,383
- Old lady not go without daughter.
- I know, I know.

323
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,782
And if old lady not go:

324
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:13,721
- Mayor of Tobiki be mad at you.
- Mayor of Tobiki will be mad at you. I know.

325
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:16,952
- Oh, no, no, please.
- Everyone here, boss.

326
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:20,326
- Goat unmarried lady goat. No children.
- No, you'll have to get down.

327
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:23,127
You'll never get it
off the ground, captain.

328
00:21:24,303 --> 00:21:26,965
- Sakini, come on, we gotta get started.
- You get in, boss.

329
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,870
And no one else going, boss.
No one else is going.

330
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,807
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, you got another customer.

331
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:38,973
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Oh, no.

332
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:41,449
- Sakini! Wait. Please wait.
- What?

333
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,918
Now, who in the blazes is he?

334
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:47,547
Who in the blazes is he, boss?
Never see before.

335
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:51,059
Ask him what he's doing sitting here,
please.

336
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,262
He say he see people
going on a trip, boss.

337
00:21:57,436 --> 00:21:59,597
- He think he like to go along too.
- No, please...

338
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:04,731
He does? Well, you tell him for me
that he's gotta get off right now.

339
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,537
Come on.

340
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,175
No, no. What?

341
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:12,977
Oh, he say why you not take him, boss?

342
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:14,482
- You take goat.
- Oh, no.

343
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:16,780
He say maybe you think
he not as good as goat.

344
00:22:16,955 --> 00:22:21,415
Tell him for me, Sakini,
that the eyes of Washington are on...

345
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,154
The world is on Washington,
and the eyes of Washington are on me.

346
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,163
Will you just... Folks, please,
I would love to take you.

347
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,664
Folks, if this was my jeep...

348
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:32,531
...or if this wasn't against regulations,
I'd be only too...

349
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,194
- Captain Fisby.
- Yes, sir.

350
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:36,102
What do you think you're doing?

351
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:40,075
Well, it's hard to explain, sir. No, just...

352
00:22:40,913 --> 00:22:42,642
What are they saying?

353
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:46,079
They say tell fat old man to shut up
so we can get started.

354
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:55,716
Which one of you men made that noise?

355
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:05,334
Just a second. Where are you going?
Hey, Captain Fisby. Sakini.

356
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:07,165
Come back here. You hear me?

357
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,160
No, just a minute please.
Just a minute. Which road?

358
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:46,773
Just a minute please, just a minute.
What did she say?

359
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:49,641
Old lady say, boss,
that she want to go to Awasi, boss...

360
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:53,581
...because she got sister she not see
in 22 half years.

361
00:23:53,752 --> 00:23:56,346
We're on duty, Sakini,
we're not on a tour of the island.

362
00:23:56,521 --> 00:24:00,719
Now, would you please just ask her for me,
which is the road to Tobiki?

363
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:05,457
- That way.
- This way?

364
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,326
All right, that's all I asked you.

365
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:24,611
All right. All right.

366
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:28,742
- Well, so this is Tobiki.
- Tobiki, no. This Awasi, boss.

367
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,412
I distinctly asked this lady
to tell me the way to Tobiki.

368
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:35,116
Well, old lady make mistake, boss.
Very sorry.

369
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:38,956
- Well, you know, we can't go...
- Oh, sorry, boss, but she not very smart.

370
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:40,723
Yeah.

371
00:24:51,843 --> 00:24:53,538
All right, which road?

372
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:56,442
No, no, don't ask her. I don't trust her.

373
00:24:59,184 --> 00:25:03,518
- All right. What are they saying?
- Children want to go to Yatoda, boss.

374
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:06,849
I suppose they've got some
cousins that they want to visit there.

375
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:09,459
No, ocean at Yatoda, boss.

376
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:10,890
Children never see ocean.

377
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:14,590
Our orders are to proceed
directly to Tobiki.

378
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:16,461
Now, which road?

379
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,869
There.

380
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,171
There. Over here, huh?

381
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:25,172
All right.

382
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:46,760
- Boss...
- No, don't tell me, this is Yatoda.

383
00:25:46,932 --> 00:25:49,696
- How you know, boss?
- Well, I recognize the ocean.

384
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:17,621
Where is this? Whose uncle
or cousin lives here?

385
00:26:17,796 --> 00:26:19,320
This Tobiki, boss.

386
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:22,526
- Sakini!
- I don't believe it.

387
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:24,760
I don't believe it.

388
00:26:36,114 --> 00:26:37,342
Now, according to plan B...

389
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:40,110
...my first job here is to
hold a public meeting, Sakini.

390
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:42,845
You see, I want to make
certain that they understand...

391
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:45,251
...that I come as their friend.
- Sure.

392
00:26:45,423 --> 00:26:49,223
That we intend to lift the yoke
of oppression from their shoulders.

393
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:52,022
They'll like that, boss.
That their favorite speech.

394
00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:54,097
What do you mean,
their favorite speech?

395
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,894
When Japanese come,
they say same thing.

396
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:59,468
- Then take everything.
- No, no, no.

397
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:02,799
No, you don't understand.
We don't come to take anything from them.

398
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:04,908
We've come here
to give them something.

399
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:07,203
That's all right, boss. We not mind.

400
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:10,212
After eight centuries, we get used to it.

401
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:11,849
Now when friends come...

402
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:14,349
...we hide everything quick as dickens.

403
00:27:14,853 --> 00:27:18,789
So I'm go tell people
you make your speech, boss.

404
00:27:18,957 --> 00:27:22,017
So socks up, boss.

405
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,264
Everyone here eager to meet you, boss.

406
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:06,870
Might as well get started.

407
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:08,403
- Citizens of...
- Up here, boss.

408
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:10,063
- They'll see you.
- Thank you.

409
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:12,642
Citizens of Tobiki...

410
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:20,482
- Citizens of Tobiki village...
- Sorry, boss.

411
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:23,621
- Can't begin lecture yet.
- What seems to be the trouble?

412
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:26,052
- Not good manners, boss.
- Why?

413
00:28:26,224 --> 00:28:29,352
Because people bring you gifts.
You must accept gifts first.

414
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:32,394
No, Sakini, wait a minute,
you got it all wrong.

415
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,896
I'm here to bring gifts
from my government to them.

416
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:37,933
No, very rude.
Make people feel poor, boss.

417
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:40,037
I don't want to do that. Get up, Sakini.

418
00:28:40,238 --> 00:28:42,502
Tell them I'll accept gifts,
but in the name...

419
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:45,575
...of the United States
occupation forces.

420
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:48,175
All right?

421
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:53,545
Here Mr. Hokaida, boss.
He give you very nice gift.

422
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:56,084
Oh, thank you very, very much.
What is it?

423
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:58,449
That's a very splendid
cricket cage, boss.

424
00:28:58,623 --> 00:29:02,252
- What do you use a cricket cage for?
- You keep your crickets in there.

425
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:04,520
No, there isn't. There's no cricket inside.

426
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:06,960
No, you gotta get
your own cricket, boss.

427
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:08,997
- No one gonna get for you.
- Oh, I see.

428
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:11,226
I got it, yeah. Thank you.
Thank him for me.

429
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:14,668
Tell him I'll keep
my eye open for a cricket.

430
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,273
Yeah. What do you keep a
cricket in a cage for?

431
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:20,275
So fortune smile on you, boss.
A cricket very good luck.

432
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:22,970
- Oh, that's nice.
- Boss, here Mr. Omura.

433
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:24,945
He give you chopstick.

434
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:29,612
- What did he say?
- He say hope that only food...

435
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:32,882
...of gods touch your lips.
- No, that's... That's very nice.

436
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:35,049
That's one of the
nicest things I've heard.

437
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:38,195
- Boss, Mr. Seiko.
- Yes?

438
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:41,231
Thank you.

439
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:48,237
That's wooden sandal, boss,
very comfortable for tired feet.

440
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:50,465
He say may you walk in prosperity.

441
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:55,341
You tell him that I will walk in the
cool meadow of pleasant memories.

442
00:29:56,982 --> 00:30:01,043
- What's the matter? Is that all right?
- Oh, boss, that's very pretty, boss.

443
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,651
Thank you. That's all right.
Thank you very much.

444
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,485
- And, boss, here Miss Higa Jiga.
- Hi.

445
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:09,126
She unmarried lady, boss.

446
00:30:09,294 --> 00:30:10,818
She give you three eggs.

447
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:12,793
Isn't that nice?

448
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:15,797
Yes... No, tell her that I'll have
these eggs for breakfast.

449
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:17,559
You tell her.

450
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:19,763
Yeah, yeah.

451
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:22,030
Chicken and the eggs, huh?

452
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:25,232
She hope you gonna enjoy
your turtle egg, boss.

453
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,674
- Turtle eggs? Oh, my.
- Yes.

454
00:30:29,714 --> 00:30:32,410
Oh, you very big success, boss.
They sure like you already.

455
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,814
Oh, I'm... Yes. Turtle eggs?

456
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:37,546
- This Mr. Oshira, boss.
- Hold these for me, Sakini.

457
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:38,984
I'm getting a bit too much.

458
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:42,058
He give you a very nice
lacquered cup, boss.

459
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,626
He make that cup hisself.

460
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:45,786
No, he didn't.
Well, you thank him for me...

461
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:49,957
...and tell him that I'll be forever indebted
to him for his very lovely gift.

462
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:52,069
You are most welcome, captain.

463
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:54,528
Hey, you speak English.

464
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:58,733
Sure, boss, Mr. Oshira teach me
English when I'm a little boy in Tobiki.

465
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,141
- How do you like...?
- In my youth, I work in Manila.

466
00:31:02,313 --> 00:31:04,873
How is Mr. McKinley?

467
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,041
Oh, you mean President McKinley?

468
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:08,981
Well, I'm afraid somebody shot him.

469
00:31:09,154 --> 00:31:11,679
- I am sorry.
- Well, it was a long time ago, you know.

470
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:14,216
Yes, a long time.

471
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:17,322
May August moon fill your cup.

472
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:19,224
Why an August moon, sir?

473
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:25,302
All moons good, but August
moon little older, little wiser.

474
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,201
Is it...? Sakini said that you
made this cup all by yourself.

475
00:31:29,374 --> 00:31:32,207
- Oh, yes.
- You know that this is a lost art, Sakini.

476
00:31:32,377 --> 00:31:36,438
This is an industry we could start
right here, right now in Tobiki.

477
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:39,310
- Think you could mass-produce these?
- Mass-produce?

478
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:42,317
Yes, you know, set up machines,
turn them out by the gross.

479
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:47,452
I take pride in making
one cup at a time, captain.

480
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:50,651
How many do you think
you could turn out in, oh, say, one day?

481
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:56,099
If I work hard,
maybe one or two a week.

482
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,731
Fine, that's good,
you make as many as you can.

483
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:00,700
We'll send them up
to the Post Exchange.

484
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:03,033
And sell them as fast
as you can turn them out.

485
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,641
I shall do my best.

486
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:08,774
Fine. We're in business. Now, Mr. Hokaida,
you make those cricket cages...

487
00:32:08,947 --> 00:32:11,279
...and the getas, fine,
we can sell a lot of those.

488
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:13,542
And the chopsticks, great.
A lot of those.

489
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:17,586
And I saw some straw hats.
See those straw hats? Make a lot of those.

490
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:20,053
We're going into
the souvenir business, folks.

491
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:21,453
We gonna make money, boss?

492
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:23,856
Make enough of these,
I'll guarantee recovery...

493
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,496
...of Tobiki village. You tell them that.

494
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:33,168
Oh, boss, you very big success.
They sure like you already, boss.

495
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:35,898
And they say they will make
everything fast as dickens.

496
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:38,474
Sakini, ask them to postpone
any more gifts for now.

497
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:40,907
I wanna tell them
what we're going to do for them.

498
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,205
Okay.

499
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:45,777
What?

500
00:32:46,784 --> 00:32:50,743
Okay. They say okay, boss. They got
no more presents for you anyhow.

501
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:53,482
It's important that I tell them
about the schoolhouse...

502
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:55,717
...that we'll build for their children.

503
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:59,921
Now, according to plan B, I believe it says
the direct approach is the most effective.

504
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:02,760
- So you ready?
- Oh, all set, boss.

505
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:04,834
Do you want to be ignorant?

506
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:09,730
- What? What was that?
- They say yes, boss.

507
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:12,775
Yes? You mean they
want to be ignorant?

508
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:16,277
Oh, no, boss. Oh, in Japanese, boss,
yes mean no.

509
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:19,211
They say, "Yes, we not
want to be ignorant."

510
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:21,818
Oh, I see.

511
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:24,853
Do you want your children
to be ignorant?

512
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:29,554
Now, what was that?

513
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:31,922
They say no, boss.

514
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:33,563
No? Wait a minute now.

515
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:35,631
Sakini, no, they do? Or no, they don't?

516
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,099
Yes, boss. They not want
no ignorant children.

517
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,931
Right. Now...

518
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:45,667
...there's gonna be a daily issue
of rice for everybody here.

519
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:52,044
Yes, yes. And we're gonna build
a fine new schoolhouse...

520
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:54,185
...for your children.

521
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:57,286
Wait. Pentagon-shaped.

522
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:02,353
Pentagon.

523
00:34:03,428 --> 00:34:04,759
Pentagon.

524
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:08,288
She say, "What is a pentagon?"
Boss, they never hear before.

525
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:10,331
They've never heard of the Pentagon?

526
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,765
- No, boss.
- They certainly do need a school here.

527
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:15,064
Pentagon. Everybody knows
what the Pentagon is.

528
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,641
The P... It's...

529
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,143
Well, it really means
five-sided, you know, Sakini.

530
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:24,611
- Five-sided?
- Yes, it has five si...

531
00:34:38,863 --> 00:34:42,890
They say... Boss, they say there are no
children in Tobiki got the five sides.

532
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:45,058
No, no, the school.

533
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:48,296
The school has five sides,
not the children. I mean, not in re...

534
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:51,033
No, you see, it's like a building
in Washington, folks.

535
00:34:51,209 --> 00:34:54,406
And everybody is gonna
learn about democracy.

536
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:03,209
They say, "What is a democracy?" boss.
They know what rice is.

537
00:35:03,388 --> 00:35:07,051
Yes, all right. Democracy is a
system of self-determination.

538
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:10,422
It's the... It's the right
to make the wrong choice.

539
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:17,196
Wait a minute, we're not
getting through to them.

540
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:18,596
Let me explain it this way.

541
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,706
Suppose I'm back home and I don't like
the way that Uncle Sam is treating me.

542
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:24,603
Well, do you know what I can do?

543
00:35:24,776 --> 00:35:28,644
I can write to the president himself,
and I can tell him so.

544
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:38,421
They say, "But do you send
that letter?" boss.

545
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,990
- Let's get on with the lecture now.
- Okay.

546
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,457
Now we'll show you
how democracy really operates.

547
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:46,290
We'll hold an election.
We're gonna organize this village.

548
00:35:46,464 --> 00:35:48,830
- Is the mayor here?
- Here's the mayor. White coat.

549
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,026
We'll have to get him a new coat.
We wouldn't want a new mayor.

550
00:35:52,203 --> 00:35:54,398
Keep the mayor.
Very hard to find a white coat.

551
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:56,733
We got the mayor.
Now we need a chief of police.

552
00:35:56,908 --> 00:36:00,674
And a chief of agriculture. Now who'd
make a good chief of agriculture here?

553
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:08,848
They say they like Mr. Seiko.
He the best man for the job.

554
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,250
- He's an experienced farmer?
- He artist, boss.

555
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:13,720
- What?
- He artist. He draw lovely picture...

556
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,552
...of golden wheat, butterfly...

557
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:18,662
Sakini, just because he draws
a very nice picture of wheat...

558
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,958
...that doesn't make him
an experienced wheat farmer.

559
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,364
Wheat not grow here anyhow,
just sweet potatoes.

560
00:36:26,504 --> 00:36:30,804
All right. Well, if he's their choice. Fine.
Now, we're gonna have to have...

561
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:35,308
- What did he say?
- He want a white coat like mayor, boss.

562
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,177
You said that we can't get... That's all right.
If we don't get a white coat...

563
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:44,287
You know what we'll do? We'll get him
a helmet, and have written on the helmet:

564
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:46,320
"Chief of agriculture."

565
00:36:49,961 --> 00:36:52,486
Now... Right, fine.
Now, we need a chief of police.

566
00:36:52,663 --> 00:36:55,188
Now, who'd make a good chief
of police?

567
00:36:57,168 --> 00:37:00,501
Hokaida, boss. They say they like
Mr. Hokaida. He champion wrestler.

568
00:37:00,671 --> 00:37:02,662
- They afraid of him.
- Yeah.

569
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,330
- That's all right.
- Strong, boss.

570
00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:07,967
Yes, indeed. All right, Fine.
Now we gotta... What?

571
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:09,670
- What'd he say?
- He want a helmet.

572
00:37:09,847 --> 00:37:12,873
Oh, fine, sure, we'll requisition
a helmet for him too.

573
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,984
All right? Fine. Now for the ladies.

574
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:16,745
Now, we're gonna organize...

575
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:18,388
...a... I know what it is...

576
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:20,922
...it's a Ladies League
for Democratic Action...

577
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:23,424
...and we're gonna have to
have a league president.

578
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:25,494
Now, who'd make
a good league president...

579
00:37:25,663 --> 00:37:28,097
...for the Ladies League
for Democratic Action?

580
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:30,530
The ladies like that.
They never vote before.

581
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:32,259
Fine.

582
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,540
Higa Jiga. They say they want Higa Jiga.
She gonna make a classy president.

583
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:41,605
I'm sure.

584
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:43,573
What?

585
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:47,446
Yes, I know. No, never mind.
I understand.

586
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:50,519
Tell her I'll get her a helmet too.
Yeah, all right, fine.

587
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:53,987
Yes, fine, all right. Fine. Now, now.

588
00:37:54,158 --> 00:37:55,716
I've been talking a long time.

589
00:37:55,893 --> 00:38:00,592
Folks, I'll bet you there are questions
you'd like to ask me. Ask them, Sakini.

590
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:09,929
Oh, she say, "What time it is?" boss.

591
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:12,473
Time? It's quarter to 5. Why?

592
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:16,044
Oh, they got to go then, boss.
They not want to miss sunset.

593
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:19,911
Every afternoon they like to go sit
in the pine grove and sip tea...

594
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,551
...watch the sun go down.

595
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,314
Isn't that nice. All right, Sakini,
you thank them all for me and tell them...

596
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:29,654
...they can go to the pine grove and
sip tea and watch the sun go down.

597
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:36,156
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

598
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:37,926
Thank you very much.

599
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:39,126
Thank you.

600
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:48,806
How do you think we did?

601
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,643
Oh, they cooperate, boss.
Future look very rosy.

602
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,512
I wonder where I can find a cricket.

603
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:57,153
Well, maybe have cricket
in your house now, not know.

604
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:59,118
- I'll take these.
- Okay.

605
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,349
- Thanks, Sakini.
- Sure.

606
00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:04,859
- I'll be right here you want me, boss.
- Right.

607
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,305
Yes?

608
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:51,771
- You busy, boss?
- No. What is it, Sakini?

609
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:55,811
Boss, Mr. Sumata leave
a present for you.

610
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,448
Put it on the shelf where it
will be out of the way.

611
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:00,607
Not able to, boss, the present get mad.

612
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:02,377
What?

613
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:08,891
- Who's she?
- Souvenir.

614
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,789
What...? What are you talking about?

615
00:40:10,962 --> 00:40:12,987
This the present from Mr. Sumata, boss.

616
00:40:13,164 --> 00:40:16,600
Introducing Lotus Blossom,
geisha girl first-class.

617
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:20,100
America-san, Captain Fisby.

618
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,938
She say she very happy
to belong to handsome captain.

619
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:33,777
- She say she gonna serve you well.
- She's not gonna serve me at all.

620
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:37,682
I want you to get your friend. I want
you to tell him I'm returning his gift.

621
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,289
- Impossible to do, boss.
- Why?

622
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,086
Mr. Sumata go to mountain, visit cousin.

623
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,856
He leave present for you and
wish you very best success in Tobiki.

624
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:49,657
What? What did she say?

625
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:52,632
She said she want know where
you want her to stay, boss.

626
00:40:52,803 --> 00:40:57,069
I d... I don't care where she stays,
but she can't stay here.

627
00:40:57,241 --> 00:41:00,677
Where she go, boss?
She got no home now.

628
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:06,641
- Look... Wait a minute.
- She want to put your kimono on for you.

629
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:10,275
- She trained to please you.
- I know what she's trained to do.

630
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:12,752
And I don't need any translation there.

631
00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:16,381
Now, you get my stuff
out of the supply shack...

632
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,791
...and you... You know,
and we'll put her up over there.

633
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:23,496
Not very democratic, boss.
You make her lose face.

634
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:26,831
- She think she bad geisha girl.
- I've got a bit of face to save.

635
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:32,465
Now, don't give me any of that
Oriental hanky-panky business, you know.

636
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:40,175
All right, what...? What's she saying?

637
00:41:40,351 --> 00:41:42,649
Oh, she say for me
to go home to grandpa, boss.

638
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,879
She first-class geisha girl.

639
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:47,149
She know her business.

640
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:50,791
- Good night, boss.
- Sakini?

641
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:55,864
This is all a big mistake. You kn...

642
00:41:56,267 --> 00:41:58,258
S... Sakini.

643
00:41:59,336 --> 00:42:01,270
- Me.
- Me.

644
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:03,964
- Me, no.
- Me, no.

645
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:07,204
No, this is not a kimono.
This is a bathrobe...

646
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:10,404
...and I don't want to put it on, you see?

647
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:13,912
Sakini!

648
00:42:14,518 --> 00:42:17,146
This is against regulations.

649
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:19,247
Hello!

650
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:24,125
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.

651
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:27,992
- This is Colonel Purdy.
- Yes, sir.

652
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:31,328
<i>Just thought I'd check up on you.
How are things going?</i>

653
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:32,867
<i>Anything I can do for you?</i>

654
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:35,164
I can't think of a thing, sir.

655
00:42:36,107 --> 00:42:39,975
<i>I realize it's bound to get
lonely for you down there.</i>

656
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:42,009
<i>So you know
what I'm gonna do, my boy?</i>

657
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,148
<i>- Now, what are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you.</i>

658
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:48,877
<i>I'm gonna send you some of
my old Adventure magazines.</i>

659
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:51,681
No, I don't want them.

660
00:42:51,856 --> 00:42:53,824
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir, very much.

661
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:57,927
I would like something to read, sir.

662
00:42:58,095 --> 00:43:00,359
<i>How are you getting
along with the natives?</i>

663
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:02,192
Well, it's an age-old problem, sir.

664
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:06,496
It's a question... Or a struggle to see
who's going to lose face.

665
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,001
<i>I understand.</i>

666
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:12,939
As Mrs. Purdy says, "East is East, and
West is West and there can be no twain."

667
00:43:13,577 --> 00:43:15,204
<i>But you are making progress?</i>

668
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:18,371
Well, nothing that I'd like
to put on paper, sir.

669
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:21,712
<i>Well, send in a detailed progress report.</i>

670
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:24,878
Well, if that's what
you'd like me to do, sir. Yes, sir.

671
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:29,890
<i>You'll find that these people lack
the capacity for sustained endeavor.</i>

672
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,028
<i>Don't hesitate to build a fire under them.</i>

673
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,824
I don't think that that
will be necessary, sir.

674
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:38,662
<i>Don't forget, the eyes of
Washington are on you, Fisby.</i>

675
00:43:38,836 --> 00:43:40,963
Oh, I hope not, sir.

676
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:46,608
<i>It just occurred to me. Have you given
any thought to physical education?</i>

677
00:43:46,777 --> 00:43:49,177
Well, I don't think that...

678
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:52,042
You know, sir, that was a
masterpiece of timeliness, sir.

679
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,514
<i>Thank you, my boy.</i>

680
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,814
<i>Could you use a deck of cards?</i>

681
00:43:58,856 --> 00:44:01,290
Sir, l...

682
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:05,620
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

683
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:08,060
<i>Fisby, you're getting weak.</i>

684
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,257
No. No.

685
00:44:10,935 --> 00:44:13,563
Well, be good, my boy.

686
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,364
Keep up the good fight.

687
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,097
Bye-bye.

688
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:23,707
No.

689
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:29,042
No, wait.

690
00:44:48,072 --> 00:44:49,733
Sakini!

691
00:44:58,215 --> 00:44:59,910
Sakini!

692
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,849
Good morning, good morning, listen...

693
00:45:05,022 --> 00:45:07,081
...do you know where Sakini lives?

694
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:09,021
Good morning.
Do you know where S...?

695
00:45:09,526 --> 00:45:11,994
Do you know where my chief of police...?
Do you know...?

696
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:15,154
Do you know where my chief
of police is? My chief of agricul...

697
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,637
Sakini!

698
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:25,666
Oh, boss. Say, where you been?
Been looking all over for you.

699
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:28,573
Where have you been?
Now, where's my chief of agriculture?

700
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:30,873
There's not a man
working this morning, Sakini.

701
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:32,845
Look around for yourself. Not a man...

702
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:36,748
Wait a second, boss. Lotus Blossom
leave all her things at Awasi, boss.

703
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:40,721
She got no way to come here, boss,
so everyone take a wheelbarrow...

704
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:42,756
...and go help bring Lotus Blossom.

705
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:46,761
Do you mean to tell me that she has
so much stuff, it takes my entire staff...

706
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:49,661
...to move this woman...?
This girl to my village?

707
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:53,030
No, boss, but chief of police
not trust chief of agriculture...

708
00:45:53,203 --> 00:45:55,671
- No.
...and Mr. Mayor not trust Mr. Oshira...

709
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,036
...so all got to go, boss.
- Oh, I see.

710
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:01,311
Mr. Oshira? That old man?

711
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:04,641
He old, boss, but he not dead.

712
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:09,411
Well, that's a fine way for a... That's a
great way for officials to act. That's...

713
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:11,884
As soon as they get back,
I want to see them.

714
00:46:12,056 --> 00:46:13,614
Okay, boss.

715
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:14,667
- What's going on?
- I don't know, boss.

716
00:48:14,845 --> 00:48:16,938
- What's the trouble?
- Don't know, boss.

717
00:48:19,783 --> 00:48:21,011
You know what they say?

718
00:48:21,185 --> 00:48:23,449
They say they got
discrimination here, boss.

719
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,817
Discrimination? Where? Where?

720
00:48:33,897 --> 00:48:36,457
Boss. Hey, boss, she gonna tell.

721
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:38,959
- Lookit...
- She gonna show you, boss.

722
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:41,331
- She gonna show you. They'll wait...
- All right.

723
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:49,035
They're waiting for the rice, boss.

724
00:48:49,213 --> 00:48:51,613
- Yes?
- At the rice place.

725
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:56,718
Lotus Blossom come along.

726
00:48:57,321 --> 00:49:00,518
- That's Lotus Blossom?
- That's Lotus Blossom.

727
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:10,564
Ration clerk come out there.

728
00:49:19,977 --> 00:49:22,775
All right, all right. Listen... No.

729
00:49:22,946 --> 00:49:24,174
I wish you wouldn't use...

730
00:49:24,348 --> 00:49:28,011
No, boss. She still use it.
She the ration clerk.

731
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:31,216
He invite her in.

732
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:35,049
Wait.

733
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,625
Look, wait a minute! Look.

734
00:49:38,795 --> 00:49:41,059
This is what undermines
the democratic ideal.

735
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:45,031
You tell her that I intend to do
something about it. You tell her.

736
00:49:48,138 --> 00:49:50,902
No. Wait a minute. Wait.

737
00:49:51,542 --> 00:49:53,134
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

738
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,404
Just... Now, wait a minute,
I'm gonna see right now...

739
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,980
...we'll have to get rid
of this disrupting factor...

740
00:49:59,149 --> 00:50:01,481
...in our recovery program.

741
00:50:04,888 --> 00:50:07,618
- McEvoy at Awasi, please.
- What you gonna do, boss?

742
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:10,282
This village isn't big enough
for plan B and a geisha.

743
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,122
Tobiki never have a geisha girl before.
We like very much.

744
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:15,788
She's got to go, she's... No.

745
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:20,562
Major McEvoy?
This is Captain Fisby at Tobiki.

746
00:50:20,737 --> 00:50:22,102
Just a moment.

747
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:27,642
I have a request, sir, from one of my people
to transfer to your village.

748
00:50:27,811 --> 00:50:31,872
It's... Yes, sir. It's a female citizen, sir.

749
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,072
Her job?

750
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:37,778
Boss, please, do not make her go.
Not democratic, boss.

751
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:40,685
Yes, as a matter of fact.

752
00:50:40,857 --> 00:50:46,124
Yes, her name is Lotus Blossom, major.
How did you know?

753
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:50,164
No, no, sir. No, sir, I am not trying
to put anything over on you, sir.

754
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:53,826
It's... Major...

755
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,865
Oh, you did?

756
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,600
Oh, you did?

757
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:05,777
Oh, he know Lotus Blossom, boss?

758
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:09,851
Yes, you know something?

759
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,615
As a matter of fact,
Lotus Blossom was at Awasi.

760
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,054
Nearly wrecked his plan for recovery.

761
00:51:16,226 --> 00:51:18,194
"Ah, so." Don't give me that, "Ah, so."

762
00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:22,423
Listen. Do you know that she has been
booted out of every village...

763
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:24,590
...by every commander on the island?

764
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:29,432
- Oh, poor little Lotus Blossom.
- Oh, poor little Lotus Blossom.

765
00:51:29,606 --> 00:51:33,633
Now I know why Mr. Sumata, or whatever
his name is just... off he goes, disappears.

766
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,175
I know why. I know.

767
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:38,371
The major gave him 100 yen
to get that girl out of that village.

768
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:41,813
Well, by golly, she's not gonna cause
any dissension here. No.

769
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:49,618
Ladies. Ladies. Ladies.

770
00:51:49,793 --> 00:51:52,284
Close the door. Close the door. Wait.

771
00:51:52,462 --> 00:51:55,920
Ladies. Ladies. Ladies. Hey, ladies.

772
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,693
Just a minute, please.
All right, just one minute.

773
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:00,530
Please, just...

774
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,171
What is it you want, ma'am?

775
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:07,639
She say she waiting
for some democratic action, boss.

776
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:09,403
And if she don't get it, boss...

777
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:11,911
...she gonna write this Uncle Sammy
you talk about.

778
00:52:12,082 --> 00:52:13,845
Wait, no, we don't want to do that.

779
00:52:14,017 --> 00:52:17,350
We don't want letters going to
Washington about any trouble around here.

780
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:20,922
The discrimination,
which all these lovely ladies have been...

781
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:23,082
...worried about.
We're gonna take care...

782
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,490
We'll take care of it,
it'll be taken care of.

783
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:35,737
Oh, no, she say please
not eliminate discrimination, boss.

784
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:37,840
Just give her some.

785
00:52:38,008 --> 00:52:39,942
Now, what does she mean by that?

786
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,739
She say Lotus Blossom
unfair competition.

787
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:45,279
Oh, well, granted.

788
00:52:45,449 --> 00:52:48,646
And she say you promise
that everyone gonna be equal, boss.

789
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:51,185
And I intend to keep my word.

790
00:52:51,355 --> 00:52:53,186
But she say she can't be equal, boss...

791
00:52:53,357 --> 00:52:56,815
...unless she have everything
Lotus Blossom have.

792
00:52:56,993 --> 00:53:00,019
What Lotus Blossom has
the government doesn't issue.

793
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:05,963
All right, all right.

794
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,929
Yes, just a minute now.
What is this?

795
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:13,440
She say she want you to get her
and the Ladies League the following items:

796
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:18,570
A, red stuff to put on lips like geisha girl.
B, stuff that smell very nice.

797
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:21,047
What do you think
the Post Exchange would think...

798
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:24,085
...if I put in a requisition for lipstick?
This is ridiculous.

799
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:26,215
This, I can't do.

800
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:31,759
- Now what?
- Oh, she say...

801
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:35,056
...she think she gonna have to write
this Uncle Sam after all, boss.

802
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:37,029
No, you don't...

803
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,600
Wait a minute.
Ladies, wait a minute, please.

804
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,931
Ladies, ladies,
please, will you come back?

805
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:43,629
You, ladies, just come back here.

806
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,275
Look, no, just one. Look, sit down.

807
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:48,035
You, sit down. Come on. Here now.

808
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:50,008
There's a nice girl. Sit down.

809
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,011
The rest of you... Don't... Please don't.

810
00:53:52,182 --> 00:53:54,946
Now, will you explain...?
Sakini, listen very carefully.

811
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:57,086
Will you...? Oh, my.

812
00:53:57,254 --> 00:54:02,487
Just explain to her that I will phone
the Post Exchange at Awasi...

813
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,560
...and I will see if I can't get some...

814
00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:08,323
I'll get some talcum powder,
and some shaving lotion.

815
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:09,726
You know, tell her.

816
00:54:11,134 --> 00:54:12,362
Yeah. All right?

817
00:54:13,203 --> 00:54:15,103
Yeah?

818
00:54:19,276 --> 00:54:21,403
Yeah, it's all right. Yes?

819
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:25,147
What now? What did she say?

820
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,281
Oh, she say one more thing, boss.

821
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:32,286
She say she want you to get Lotus Blossom
to teach all the ladies...

822
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:34,772
...to be geisha girl.

823
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:39,542
No. No. No.

824
00:54:39,712 --> 00:54:42,875
No. No.

825
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,870
<i>Fisby-san!</i>

826
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,308
Oh, boss, look who's here.
Lotus Blossom come to see you.

827
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:29,646
All right, now.
Where have you been all day?

828
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,811
Oh, don't bother to tell me. I know.

829
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,082
You've been out, upsetting the agri...

830
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:37,159
Oh, no, upsetting
the agricultural horsecart?

831
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:43,930
Oh, she say sun burst through clouds
now that you smile on her, boss.

832
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,466
I'm not smiling.

833
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,172
- Oh, boss, you know what she give you?
- The works.

834
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:55,641
No, when lady give a gentleman
chrysanthemum bud in Okinawa...

835
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,247
...that mean that her heart
ready to unfold.

836
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,475
Well, this is one bud
that's not going to bloom.

837
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,847
Now, what's this?

838
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:09,288
<i>She want to know
if you want some tsukemono, boss.</i>

839
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,485
<i>- No.
- Tsukemono good to eat between meals.</i>

840
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,688
No, no, no.

841
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,236
Will you...?
Will you, please...? Will you...?

842
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:22,736
Tell her to leave my feet alone.

843
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:25,837
What?

844
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:29,977
She very worried about you.

845
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:32,945
<i>Now, when you go out in hot sun,
you must wear kasa on head.</i>

846
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:37,485
Well, you know something, you tell her to
stop worrying about my head and my feet...

847
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:40,851
...and one thing very important,
she's just got to stop...

848
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:44,118
...interfering with my recovery program.

849
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:49,857
- Do you want some tea, boss?
- No, I don't. No, no, no.

850
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,700
- Oh, you want to hear some music, boss?
- No. No, I don't...

851
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,140
She say you jealous, boss.

852
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:05,880
- You want to tell her your trouble, boss?
- Tell her my...? What?

853
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,142
What do I want
to tell her my troubles for?

854
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,479
Oh, she geisha girl, boss,
that's her business.

855
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,145
Yeah, some business. Some business.

856
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,984
Oh, she very sad, boss.

857
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,994
She want to help you because she...

858
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,291
She say you best boss she ever have.

859
00:58:23,467 --> 00:58:28,370
You not take money from her.
You not make her work.

860
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,899
Do you mean to tell me
that the men who owned her...

861
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:36,477
...hired her out and then...?
And they took money from her?

862
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:38,012
Oh, sure, boss.

863
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,876
Oh, well, now, really. I mean...

864
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,850
You know, where I come from,
the men who do that sort of thing...

865
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,922
Oh, you got the geisha business
in America too, boss?

866
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,650
No, but... Well, I mean...

867
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:54,991
Look, will you please explain to her
I have no intention of making her work...

868
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:58,498
...and I'm certainly not going
to take any money away from her.

869
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:00,864
- I mean, that's...
- Why not, boss?

870
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,030
She pay dues to geisha guild.
She member in good standing.

871
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,836
This is really... I mean this is
the most immoral thing I've ever heard of.

872
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,070
No, I mean, I don't say, Sakini...

873
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:13,580
...that where I come from
we don't have...

874
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:20,514
Well, you know. But, I mean,
by golly, we don't have unions.

875
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:23,057
And we don't set rates
and we don't collect dues.

876
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,091
No, no, boss, no.

877
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,594
- Geisha girl not do what you think.
- Wait a minute.

878
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,322
Everybody knows what they do.

879
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,967
Oh, no, everybody wrong, boss.

880
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,228
What do they pay her for?

881
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,632
Well, very hard to explain, boss.

882
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,173
Poor man like to feel rich.

883
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:45,372
Rich man like to feel wise.

884
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:46,914
Sad man like to feel happy.

885
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:50,747
So all go to geisha house
and tell trouble to geisha girl.

886
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:54,448
Now, she listen very politely.

887
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:58,026
She say, "Oh, that's too bad, boss."

888
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,526
She very pretty.

889
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:04,690
She make tea, and she sing,
and she dance, boss.

890
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,701
Pretty soon, troubles go away, boss.

891
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:11,204
So that not worth something, boss?

892
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:20,308
Sakini, I apologize to you,
I really apologize.

893
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:24,079
I'm very glad you cleared things up.

894
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:28,122
That's kind of...
That kind of puts a new light on things.

895
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:35,025
She say... She say why you smile
at her all of a sudden, boss?

896
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,496
You mad or something?

897
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:40,501
Sakini, will you ask her...

898
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:44,607
...if she'd be kind enough
to give geisha lessons...

899
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:48,472
...to the Ladies League
for Democratic Action?

900
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,563
Boss.

901
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:19,572
Oh, boss.

902
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:26,382
They all come to see you, boss.

903
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:27,778
Oh, what can I do for them?

904
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:32,149
Oh, they have a meeting in democratic
fashion and majority agree on resolution.

905
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:34,813
<i>They want you to build them a chaya.</i>

906
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,856
A what?

907
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,790
- A teahouse, boss.
- A teahouse?

908
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:42,227
Sure, now that Tobiki got
the geisha girl like big city, boss...

909
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:44,765
...they want a teahouse like big city too.

910
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:48,336
They say you give Ladies League
what they want, boss.

911
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:51,133
I can't build a teahouse.
I have no authority to do that.

912
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:54,766
You say rule of majority is law, boss.
You gonna break the law?

913
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:56,503
No, I'm not going to break...

914
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,083
Well, look, they're going
to have a school, you see.

915
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:06,847
Now, that's enough.

916
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:10,584
Oh, school. Well, majority too old
to go to school, boss.

917
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:12,626
<i>They want to have chaya, a teahouse.</i>

918
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:16,129
We haven't got the materials
to build a teahouse.

919
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:23,496
- What did she say?
- Oh, she say yesterday...

920
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:27,837
...big Army truck come and leave lovely
lumber and beautiful paint, boss.

921
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:31,003
That's right. It's for the schoolhouse.
It just can't be done.

922
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,115
- Oh, okay.
- No, it just can't.

923
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:43,118
They say you very mean to them, boss,
after present... They give you everything.

924
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:46,922
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, folks.
I'm really very sorry.

925
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:53,066
Oh, they very sorry too, boss,
because Tobiki like to be proud, boss.

926
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,794
Teahouse give them a face.

927
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:59,672
It's going to be a fine school. Five sides.

928
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:03,073
- May I speak, captain-san?
- Yes, of course, Mr. Oshira.

929
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:07,478
There are lovely teahouses
in the big cities...

930
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:12,782
...but the men of Tobiki
have never been inside them.

931
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,117
We are too poor.

932
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:21,754
All of my life I have dreamed
of visiting a teahouse...

933
01:03:21,932 --> 01:03:28,337
...where paper lanterns cast a light
in the lotus pond...

934
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:34,875
...and the bamboo bells hanging in the pines
tinkle as the breezes brush them.

935
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:40,406
But this picture is only in my heart.

936
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:42,745
I may never see it.

937
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:47,549
I am an old man, sir. I shall die soon.

938
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:52,293
It is evil for the soul
to depart this world...

939
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:55,488
...laden with envy or regret.

940
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:59,626
Give us our teahouse, sir.

941
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:02,169
Free my soul for death.

942
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,207
Well, we haven't any carpenters.

943
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,851
Daiku-san! Daiku-san!

944
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:26,186
Oh, boss, what you think?

945
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:31,892
Mr. Sumata and the papa-san
just come down from mountain right now.

946
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:38,898
All right, all right, I haven't got a chance.

947
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:43,140
I guess Uncle Sam is going
into the teahouse business.

948
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,754
Captain Fisby.

949
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,519
Uncle Sam.

950
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:18,875
Thank you.

951
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:20,277
Captain Fisby.

952
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,918
<i>Hello. This is Colonel Purdy.</i>

953
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,644
Yes, sir. How are you, colonel?

954
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:27,487
I want to talk to you
about your progress report.

955
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:30,490
There's nothing about the schoolhouse.
Did you get the lumber?

956
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:33,925
Yes, sir. As a matter of fact,
we're using it out there now, sir.

957
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:37,123
But, colonel, I think we're gonna
have to have some more.

958
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,758
<i>I sent ample according to specifications.
How big a structure you building?</i>

959
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,338
Well, sir, we have to consider expansion,
you know, population increase.

960
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,236
We don't need to consider expansion.

961
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,934
Our troops will be out
of there by the next generation.

962
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:53,640
Which brings me to another point. What's
this about six kids being born last week?

963
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,910
Well, it's the only thing
to fill the progress report with, sir.

964
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,179
Then you've failed
at your indoctrination.

965
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:02,291
Don't you know births are entered
under population increases?

966
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,017
They're not considered progress.

967
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:08,324
No, not children, sir. Kids. Goats.

968
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:12,531
Something's wrong with this connection.
It sounded just as if you said "goats."

969
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:15,867
You see, I'm trying to increase
the livestock down here.

970
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:20,135
Goats? Look, Fisby, suppose some
congressman flew in to inspect our team.

971
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,801
How would I explain
such a report about goats?

972
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:25,345
<i>The population
of civilians alone concerns us.</i>

973
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:29,918
<i>I want to know exactly what progress
you've made as outlined in plan B.</i>

974
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:33,988
<i>- Well, sir, I'm getting along with the people.
- In other words, nothing.</i>

975
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,623
Listen, Fisby, do you know what
Major McEvoy has accomplished in Awasi?

976
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:39,625
<i>- No, sir.
- Then I'll tell you.</i>

977
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:42,765
His fourth graders know
the alphabet through M.

978
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:46,868
His whole village can sing
"God Bless America" in English.

979
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:48,864
I wish I could say the same.

980
01:06:49,072 --> 01:06:52,735
Well, see that you do. I don't want
any rotten apples in my barrel.

981
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:55,901
I want to know exactly what
you've accomplished in five weeks.

982
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,606
Well, sir...
Well, we have started an industry.

983
01:06:58,782 --> 01:07:01,683
Matter of fact, we're sending
our first shipment out this week.

984
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,411
- Now, we're making getas. We're...
- Wait a minute.

985
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,179
What in thunder is a geta?

986
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,619
No, it isn't a geta, sir. It's plural. Getas.

987
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:11,522
Getas, you know, you have to have two.

988
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:13,889
<i>- Are you breeding some other animal?
- No, no.</i>

989
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:16,362
You see, you wear them on your feet.

990
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,731
And they're very good for
the metatarsal muscles, colonel.

991
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:24,237
And now, I have another group.
They're out there making cricket cages.

992
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,833
Captain Fisby,
what kind of cages did you say?

993
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:30,604
<i>Cricket cages, colonel.</i>

994
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:32,873
You know, the cricket.
The black bug that...

995
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:36,416
<i>It rubs its hind legs together.</i>

996
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,179
I think we can sell just thousands
of those cages.

997
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:43,086
- Of course, we don't supply the cricket.
- Naturally, not.

998
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,888
Captain Fisby,
have you taken your salt pills?

999
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:50,497
<i>Oh, yes, sir. Every day
at chaya in the pine grove.</i>

1000
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:53,962
Have you been going out in the sun
without your hat?

1001
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,367
<i>You see, I wear a kasa, sir. It's a...</i>

1002
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,407
The wind blows through the straw.

1003
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,101
<i>It kind of ventilates the brain.</i>

1004
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:07,773
I see. I see. That'll be all, captain.

1005
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,513
- Gregovich.
- Yes, sir?

1006
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:15,385
- Who's the psychiatrist over at Awasi?
- Captain McLean?

1007
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:16,889
Yes. Get him on the phone.

1008
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,995
My man at Tobiki has gone
completely off his rocker.

1009
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,301
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1010
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:30,132
Good morning.

1011
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,851
- Hello?
- Good morning.

1012
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,681
Good morning.

1013
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,711
Thank you. Thank you.

1014
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,258
Excuse me.

1015
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:32,025
I'll see you. Bye.

1016
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,540
Well, who are you?

1017
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,173
- You startled me.
- I'm Captain Fisby.

1018
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,280
Can I do something for you?

1019
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:50,916
- Oh, well, I'm Captain McLean.
- How do you do, captain?

1020
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,453
There was nobody here, so I came in.

1021
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:56,683
Medical Corps. I see it. See?

1022
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,828
- What are you doing down here in Tobiki?
- I'm on leave.

1023
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,896
Just thought I'd spend it down here...

1024
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:05,899
...making some ethnological studies
of the natives.

1025
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:08,264
- lf you have no objection.
- I don't have any.

1026
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:10,099
That's in your way. I'll take it.

1027
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:12,241
I was just examining that.

1028
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:14,842
- That's my cricket cage.
- Oh, you like crickets?

1029
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:17,309
I haven't found one,
but I have the cage.

1030
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,710
Matter of fact, I've got two.
Would you like one?

1031
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,680
Oh, no, no, no, thank you.
It's all right.

1032
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,252
- What happened to your uniform?
- Oh, it's around.

1033
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:29,323
I find getas and a kimono much more
comfortable in this climate.

1034
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:31,323
But isn't that a bathrobe?

1035
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:35,453
Well, it passes for a kimono.
Why don't you take your shoes off, captain?

1036
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:38,066
- Oh, no, thank you. Thank you, no.
- No?

1037
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,670
- I'll just keep them on.
- All right, fine. No objection, of course.

1038
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:44,306
Sit down, sit down.
In my good chair, my good chair.

1039
01:10:44,474 --> 01:10:47,102
- Thank you.
- Well...

1040
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,337
No?

1041
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:03,090
May I ask,
what are you building down the road?

1042
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:06,051
<i>Oh, that's my chaya.</i>

1043
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:08,527
Gonna be something
to write home about, Mac.

1044
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,996
<i>- A chaya?
- See, if you have a geisha...</i>

1045
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:14,500
<i>...you gotta have a chaya, you know.</i>

1046
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:16,138
How have you felt lately, Fisby?

1047
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:18,797
Mac, I'll tell you something,
I've never felt better.

1048
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:23,173
I feel reckless and happy
and carefree, and... Well...

1049
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:25,906
And it all happened the moment
I decided not to build...

1050
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:28,107
...that pentagon-shaped schoolhouse.
- What?

1051
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,548
The good colonel, he ordered me...
He ordered me...

1052
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,984
...to build a pentagon-shaped
schoolhouse here.

1053
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,555
The natives wanted a teahouse.

1054
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:37,124
Would you believe
one of them gave me a geisha girl?

1055
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:40,990
So I decided that I was going
to give them what they want.

1056
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:43,564
I guess it sounds kind of crazy,
doesn't it?

1057
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,998
Well, yes and no.

1058
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,899
You know, these are wonderful people.

1059
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:52,041
Wonderful people
with a... A strange sense of beauty.

1060
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,267
Hard-working when there's a purpose.

1061
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:55,741
You know what they're doing?

1062
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:58,745
They're making cricket cages
and lacquerware and chopsticks...

1063
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,382
...to sell as souvenirs.

1064
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:03,815
Don't let anybody ever, ever tell you
that these people are lazy.

1065
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:08,320
- That's... Oh, I see.
- No, you don't. You don't.

1066
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,322
- Oh, I see.
- No, you don't, no, no.

1067
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:11,960
You will when you study them.

1068
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:13,823
- You're building a teahouse.
- Yes.

1069
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,157
And next, I'm gonna go out
and test that soil.

1070
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,800
See if it won't grow something
besides sweet potatoes.

1071
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:20,492
I'll send for some nitrate...

1072
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,138
...some DDT and chemicals...
- Chemicals?

1073
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:24,773
Yes.

1074
01:12:26,242 --> 01:12:28,767
- You want to poison these people?
- What? No.

1075
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:31,140
- Look, captain...
- What? What?

1076
01:12:31,314 --> 01:12:32,941
I'm sorry.

1077
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:36,051
You just touched on a subject
that's very close to my heart.

1078
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:37,686
- Gardening.
- Yes?

1079
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:41,822
I've been on the point
of giving up my career...

1080
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:44,357
...just so I could set up
an experimental farm...

1081
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:48,156
...somewhere where I could raise
vegetables organically, nature's way.

1082
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:51,494
No poisons, no chemicals.

1083
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,862
Let me tell you something, captain.

1084
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,504
Chemicals will kill all your earthworms.

1085
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:00,540
- And earthworms aerate your soil.
- They do?

1086
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,974
Do you know that the earthworm
leaves castings...

1087
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:05,410
...eight times its own weight every day?

1088
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:06,809
That much?

1089
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:08,814
Organic gar... It's the only thing.

1090
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:13,319
Compost. Manure. But no chemicals.

1091
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,821
- You know a lot about this, I can tell.
- Well...

1092
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:17,050
- Well, l...
- You do.

1093
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,423
I subscribed to all the farm journals
for years, you know.

1094
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:24,088
Mac, listen to me,
I've got the... I've got the greatest idea.

1095
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:28,135
While you're here, you could really do us
a big favor. A big service, mind you.

1096
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:30,204
You could sort of take over supervision.

1097
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:34,503
Establish a kind of a... What do you call it?
An experimental station.

1098
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:37,545
Well...

1099
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:43,315
- Oh, I haven't got the time.
- Take time, man. Take time.

1100
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:45,750
This is a chance
to put your theories into facts.

1101
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,584
These are not theories.
These are proved facts.

1102
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,249
Just tell us how to go about it.
That's all, Mac.

1103
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,021
- Is your soil acid or alkaline?
- Oh, golly, I don't know.

1104
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:56,995
- That's the first thing to find out.
- You're the man we need.

1105
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,999
- You're a genius.
- I'll want plenty of manure.

1106
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:04,299
- You'll get it.
- And I want to set this program up scientif...

1107
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:08,569
- What's the matter? What is it?
- I wish I had my books, my seed...

1108
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:11,269
Oh, I've got a stack
of seed catalogs that high.

1109
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,681
- You have?
- Oh, man, and l...

1110
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:16,683
Well, let's sit down here. Sit down.
You know what you can do?

1111
01:14:16,853 --> 01:14:19,754
You can write a list of those seeds,
catalogs, and books.

1112
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,413
- And get airstrip to fly them in.
- Can you do that?

1113
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:25,425
Can I do it? Sit down. Can I do it?
Of course, I can do it.

1114
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:28,564
- Make the list...
- Every spring I've made lists of seeds.

1115
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:31,029
I never had any soil to put them in.

1116
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,997
Now I can actually germinate.

1117
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:35,535
Make the list right now
and we'll get started.

1118
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:38,037
- Corn: golden bantam.
- Yes.

1119
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,606
- And Country Gentleman.
- Right.

1120
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,106
- Hybrid.
- I got to check...

1121
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:42,574
- Hybrid.
- Hybrid? Yes.

1122
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:44,838
Gotta check with
my Department of Agriculture.

1123
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:46,504
I'll be back this afternoon...

1124
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,515
...because you and l...
We'll have tea in the pine grove, Mac.

1125
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,916
We have tea in the pine grove
every afternoon when the sun goes down.

1126
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,580
Cucumbers: Early Green Prolific.

1127
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,359
And radishes.

1128
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:00,519
Crimson giant.

1129
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,393
Crimson giant.

1130
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:08,396
- There's no answer, sir.
- What do you mean, no answer?

1131
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:12,632
Well, keep trying, I'm not the kind of a man
to take no answer for an answer.

1132
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,645
<i>Tomatoes: Ponderosa Earlyiana.</i>

1133
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,212
Watermelon:

1134
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:22,283
All American Gold Medal.

1135
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,083
Hello.

1136
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:29,281
<i>- Who is this?
- This is Captain McLean.</i>

1137
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,756
This is Colonel Purdy.

1138
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:35,125
<i>- Can you talk?
- Why not?</i>

1139
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:38,962
I'm anxious to hear your report
on you-know-who.

1140
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,035
<i>On who?</i>

1141
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,694
Captain Fisby.
The man I sent you down to examine.

1142
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:50,277
Well, colonel, looks like
I'll have to be down here several weeks.

1143
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:51,874
Several weeks?

1144
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:54,778
<i>- Well, Rome wasn't built in a day.
- What?</i>

1145
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:57,579
I said, Rome wasn't built in a day.

1146
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,118
<i>Well, you're the doctor.</i>

1147
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,313
Thank you,
but I expect to work miracles.

1148
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:06,294
<i>Splendid. Is there anything I can send?
Some old Adventure magazines or anything?</i>

1149
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:10,462
Say, colonel,
there are a couple of books I'd like.

1150
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,330
I don't think you could get them.

1151
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:14,867
<i>You name them.</i>

1152
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:18,006
<i>Well, one is the
Principles of Pea Production...</i>

1153
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:24,811
<i>...and the other one,
the Do's and Don'ts of Cabbage Culture.</i>

1154
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,243
<i>Oh, and, colonel...</i>

1155
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:29,316
...think you could lay your hands
on a soil-test kit?

1156
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:32,852
<i>- A what?
- A soil-test kit.</i>

1157
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:35,515
I wanna test the soil here,
see if it's sour.

1158
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,057
Sour, did you say?

1159
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:41,492
Well, yeah, if soil is sour,
your seeds won't germinate.

1160
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:48,830
And, oh, I'd love to lay my hands
on some bees.

1161
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,968
Something's wrong
with the connection.

1162
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:54,439
And I'm gonna have
to take some time out.

1163
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,010
I gotta build up this soil,
you know, with manure.

1164
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:00,681
<i>- Did you say manure?
- Yeah.</i>

1165
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,579
Nature's way.

1166
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:06,552
Oh, I've lost faith in chemicals.
You kill all your worms.

1167
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:08,713
Oh, let me tell you, colonel...

1168
01:17:08,891 --> 01:17:11,359
...when you kill a worm,
you're killing a friend.

1169
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:21,533
Hello?

1170
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,568
- Gregovich.
- Yes, sir?

1171
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,766
- Where's plan B?
- What did you want, sir?

1172
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:31,242
I wanna see who I send
to analyze an analyst.

1173
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,043
That's hot water.

1174
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,484
- Hot water.
- Hot water.

1175
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,681
That's it.

1176
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,522
Hey. Hey.

1177
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,428
Mac, Mac, come on, over here.

1178
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,659
- Over here.
- I got a list of seeds here.

1179
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:58,569
Put some more hot water in the pot
because we have a guest here.

1180
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:01,335
This is Lotus Blossom.

1181
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:04,775
- How do you do?
- That's the geisha girl I told you about.

1182
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:08,408
- She can't speak English.
- She doesn't need to.

1183
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:11,212
No? Oh, hey. The seeds. You sit...

1184
01:18:11,387 --> 01:18:13,787
- Sit down here, will you?
- Thank you, I'd like that.

1185
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:17,153
Have some of this. You know something?
That's real jasmine tea.

1186
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:18,588
- Really?
- Here's a pillow.

1187
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:20,956
- Thank you.
- Take off your shoes.

1188
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:26,326
- Now, about those seeds...
- No.

1189
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:29,062
Now we're gonna sit here
and watch the sun go down.

1190
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:32,469
And we're gonna contemplate
the end of the day.

1191
01:19:38,277 --> 01:19:40,177
Look, captain, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1192
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:43,871
Could you let me have
a couple of boys to help me in the fields?

1193
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:46,847
Darn Japanese beetles
are eating up all my Chinese peas.

1194
01:19:47,019 --> 01:19:50,284
All right, I'll get Sakini to get
a couple boys to help you, all right?

1195
01:19:50,455 --> 01:19:52,946
- Oh, good, thanks.
- Alrighty. Now, Mac?

1196
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,821
Sit down, Mac, and listen for a while.

1197
01:19:55,994 --> 01:19:58,485
Lotus Blossom, will you sing again
for my friend Mac?

1198
01:19:58,664 --> 01:20:01,690
- Thank you.
- Mac, but quiet, huh?

1199
01:20:01,867 --> 01:20:03,266
All right.

1200
01:20:03,435 --> 01:20:05,528
Here we go.

1201
01:20:20,986 --> 01:20:22,681
Boss?

1202
01:20:22,855 --> 01:20:26,484
Very sorry to interrupt lovely song, boss,
but emergency out here.

1203
01:20:26,658 --> 01:20:28,057
What's the matter?

1204
01:20:28,227 --> 01:20:29,626
Everyone come back, boss.

1205
01:20:30,195 --> 01:20:33,221
All right. We better go see
how they made out with the souvenirs.

1206
01:20:34,867 --> 01:20:38,030
Yeah, put it up here so we can use this.

1207
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:39,932
All right.

1208
01:20:40,105 --> 01:20:43,074
All right? Come on, let's go.

1209
01:20:46,011 --> 01:20:48,536
What's this?
Now what's happened here?

1210
01:20:48,714 --> 01:20:50,841
All the souvenirs come back, boss.

1211
01:20:51,016 --> 01:20:53,348
What do you mean?
You mean to say they didn't sell?

1212
01:20:53,518 --> 01:20:56,783
No, the soldiers who look
at the straw hats say:

1213
01:20:56,955 --> 01:20:58,923
"What you think we are? Hayseed?"

1214
01:20:59,091 --> 01:21:01,525
Mr. Oshira, look,
you were at Yatoda, what happened?

1215
01:21:01,693 --> 01:21:03,354
The Navy always spends money.

1216
01:21:03,528 --> 01:21:05,723
Sailor said, "How much you want?"

1217
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:08,696
- I said, "25 yen."
- That's good.

1218
01:21:08,867 --> 01:21:11,267
They say, "Oh, too much.

1219
01:21:11,436 --> 01:21:15,065
Can get better in five-and-ten-cent store.

1220
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,970
- Give you one nickel."
- Didn't you tell them, Mr. Oshira...

1221
01:21:18,143 --> 01:21:20,771
...that every one of those cups
is handmade?

1222
01:21:20,946 --> 01:21:23,540
They say, not care.

1223
01:21:23,715 --> 01:21:26,912
They say at home, have big machine...

1224
01:21:27,085 --> 01:21:30,714
...make ten cups every minute.

1225
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:36,126
They say, "Take nickel or jump in lake."

1226
01:21:36,395 --> 01:21:37,623
How do you like that?

1227
01:21:37,796 --> 01:21:39,696
Boss, you gonna stop work
on the teahouse?

1228
01:21:39,865 --> 01:21:41,992
No, we're not going to stop work on...

1229
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:45,193
They're gonna get that teahouse
if they don't get anything else.

1230
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:48,999
By golly, you can tell them that I'm very
proud of that work that they've done.

1231
01:21:49,174 --> 01:21:54,271
I'm so proud. And you can tell them too,
Sakini, that I'm very proud of them.

1232
01:21:54,446 --> 01:21:56,414
No, I am, I really am.

1233
01:21:56,581 --> 01:21:59,550
And I don't understand this.
No, no, no, I don't understand this.

1234
01:21:59,718 --> 01:22:00,946
I don't understand this.

1235
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:05,385
Boss, they sure wish they could make some
money to spend in the teahouse, boss.

1236
01:22:05,557 --> 01:22:08,549
Because they not like
to go poor like beggar.

1237
01:22:08,727 --> 01:22:10,388
I know, I know.

1238
01:22:14,733 --> 01:22:18,726
See, he say, boss, it not your fault
no one buy souvenir.

1239
01:22:22,674 --> 01:22:24,767
Well, they going home
to get drunk now, boss.

1240
01:22:24,943 --> 01:22:28,674
You know, I don't blame them, Sakini.
If I could find something to drink...

1241
01:22:28,847 --> 01:22:30,610
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks.

1242
01:22:30,782 --> 01:22:32,409
What are they gonna get drunk on?

1243
01:22:32,584 --> 01:22:34,381
Oh, they got nothing but brandy, boss.

1244
01:22:34,553 --> 01:22:36,987
- Nothing but brandy?
- Nothing but brandy?

1245
01:22:37,155 --> 01:22:39,487
How are you gonna manage
to get brandy?

1246
01:22:39,658 --> 01:22:42,752
Oh, we make a very fine brandy, boss,
from sweet potatoes.

1247
01:22:42,928 --> 01:22:44,555
Been making for generations.

1248
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:46,994
You make brandy yourself?

1249
01:22:47,165 --> 01:22:50,532
Yeah, sure, boss.
You want to taste some?

1250
01:22:53,839 --> 01:22:57,002
- Here you are, boss.
- Mac, Mac, my dear friend, Mac.

1251
01:22:57,175 --> 01:23:01,134
If this stuff is only halfway good, we're...
Oh, man, we're really in business.

1252
01:23:01,313 --> 01:23:03,372
This is one thing our men...
They'll buy this.

1253
01:23:03,548 --> 01:23:07,040
It may not be any good. You know,
some things even our troops won't drink.

1254
01:23:07,219 --> 01:23:08,846
- Well.
- Take a sip, boss.

1255
01:23:09,021 --> 01:23:11,148
I wanna smell it.

1256
01:23:13,525 --> 01:23:16,358
- Obviously it has a kick.
- Yeah.

1257
01:23:16,528 --> 01:23:18,291
How old is this stuff, Sakini?

1258
01:23:20,932 --> 01:23:23,332
- Seven years?
- No, seven days, boss.

1259
01:23:23,502 --> 01:23:26,494
Oh, no, no, I mean, it wouldn't
smell like that in seven days.

1260
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:28,070
They make it last week, boss.

1261
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,708
Here, you try it, will you, Mac?
You're a medical man.

1262
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:32,571
- You give it a try.
- What?

1263
01:23:34,913 --> 01:23:36,471
- You first.
- No, you're my guest.

1264
01:23:36,648 --> 01:23:38,843
I waive the honor.

1265
01:23:39,351 --> 01:23:41,751
You know, anybody ever die
or go blind from this?

1266
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,388
We not dead. We not blind.

1267
01:23:44,556 --> 01:23:48,492
- Of course not. You see? Come on, Mac.
- They've worked up an immunity.

1268
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:52,027
You see, I don't wanna kill one of
my own countrymen, you know?

1269
01:23:52,197 --> 01:23:55,223
There must be some way to test this,
isn't there, without me...?

1270
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,867
There isn't, huh?

1271
01:23:57,035 --> 01:23:59,026
Well.

1272
01:24:02,641 --> 01:24:05,007
Sakini, get me Elsa Maxwell.

1273
01:24:05,177 --> 01:24:08,044
- One goat coming up, boss.
- Elsa Maxwell. That's who we need.

1274
01:24:08,213 --> 01:24:11,011
That's Higa Jiga's goat, you know?
We'll test it on her, see?

1275
01:24:11,183 --> 01:24:13,845
Well, what are you gonna prove?
Goats have hardy stomachs.

1276
01:24:14,019 --> 01:24:16,647
No, look, if this brandy...

1277
01:24:16,822 --> 01:24:20,690
If this passes the goat test,
we're really in business, you know?

1278
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:24,795
You know why? No Marine will ever admit
that his stomach is weaker than a goat's.

1279
01:24:24,963 --> 01:24:27,591
Hey, boss, you gonna make
a guinea pig of goat?

1280
01:24:27,766 --> 01:24:30,667
Yeah, give me something to put it in.
Anything at all will do.

1281
01:24:30,836 --> 01:24:34,397
- Helmet?
- That's fine. That's fine. That's just fine.

1282
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:38,634
- Oh, Elsa Maxwell very lucky goat, boss.
- Easy, easy.

1283
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,072
Hold her head, Sakini.

1284
01:24:40,245 --> 01:24:43,612
All right, doctor,
proceed in the name of science.

1285
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:47,077
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1286
01:24:47,252 --> 01:24:51,120
We're either gonna have an industry
or goat meat for dinner.

1287
01:24:52,157 --> 01:24:54,682
- What are you doing?
- Oh, not too much.

1288
01:24:57,896 --> 01:25:00,262
She likes that.

1289
01:25:00,432 --> 01:25:02,559
Hey. Hey.

1290
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:04,258
She all right? All right?

1291
01:25:04,436 --> 01:25:06,336
What do you think, doc?

1292
01:25:06,505 --> 01:25:09,838
It doesn't seem to affect her.
Reflexes okay.

1293
01:25:10,008 --> 01:25:13,444
Well, here goes.

1294
01:25:31,463 --> 01:25:33,260
Hey.

1295
01:25:33,798 --> 01:25:35,026
Where you going, boss?

1296
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,398
I'm about to form the cooperative
brewing company of Tobiki.

1297
01:25:59,457 --> 01:26:01,254
Officers' Club at Awasi, please.

1298
01:26:01,426 --> 01:26:03,986
- We gonna make brandy, boss?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

1299
01:26:04,162 --> 01:26:06,926
Officers' Club at Awasi?
Captain Fisby speaking at Tobiki.

1300
01:26:07,098 --> 01:26:08,861
Yeah, oh, major? Major, this is Fisby.

1301
01:26:09,034 --> 01:26:11,025
Yeah, you know,
when I was with your unit...

1302
01:26:11,203 --> 01:26:14,172
...we had a hard time
keeping a supply of liquor at the club?

1303
01:26:14,339 --> 01:26:18,173
You remember? Yeah, well, major,
I think I have stumbled on to something...

1304
01:26:18,343 --> 01:26:20,140
...that might be of interest to you.

1305
01:26:20,512 --> 01:26:25,540
Yes, as you know, Tobiki
is the heart of the brandy industry.

1306
01:26:25,717 --> 01:26:28,242
<i>Brandy! Did you say brandy?</i>

1307
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,978
Yes, brandy.

1308
01:26:30,155 --> 01:26:32,521
Look up the word sweet potato
in my dictionary.

1309
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:36,559
See if there's a fancier word
for sweet potato.

1310
01:26:36,728 --> 01:26:39,094
Oh, I'm here, major, yes, here I am.

1311
01:26:39,264 --> 01:26:43,257
Yeah, now, look, major, I might be able
to supply some of that brandy to you...

1312
01:26:43,435 --> 01:26:47,701
...that is, of course, if you're willing to pay
the price and you keep the source secret.

1313
01:26:47,872 --> 01:26:49,169
Yes.

1314
01:26:49,341 --> 01:26:51,536
Oh, they've been making
it here for generations.

1315
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:55,840
Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, I'm sure
you've never tasted anything quite like it.

1316
01:26:56,014 --> 01:26:57,413
Hold on a minute, major.

1317
01:26:57,582 --> 01:27:02,679
<i>The Haitian name for sweet potato
is B-A-T-A-T-A, batata.</i>

1318
01:27:02,854 --> 01:27:08,850
Major, you've heard of
Seven Star Batata, haven't you?

1319
01:27:09,694 --> 01:27:12,561
Oh, well, they make it here
in Tobiki. Yes.

1320
01:27:12,731 --> 01:27:14,756
Seven Star got him, I think.

1321
01:27:14,933 --> 01:27:18,027
Brandy eight- or ten-day-old, better.
Nine- or ten-day-old.

1322
01:27:18,203 --> 01:27:23,937
Major, we also have Eight Star Batata,
and we have Ten Star.

1323
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:27,476
Of course, the Ten Star. Mind you,
that comes a bit more expensive. Yes?

1324
01:27:27,646 --> 01:27:30,114
That will run you...

1325
01:27:30,982 --> 01:27:34,611
...100-occupation yen a gallon.

1326
01:27:34,786 --> 01:27:36,083
Delivered.

1327
01:27:36,254 --> 01:27:37,619
Yes.

1328
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:40,451
What? How many?

1329
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:42,525
Five gallons. Yes.

1330
01:27:42,694 --> 01:27:44,719
Five gallons will be delivered
in one week.

1331
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:48,992
It'll be delivered by
our Department of Agriculture.

1332
01:27:49,167 --> 01:27:52,500
Yeah, right. You're welcome, sir. Right.

1333
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:59,339
All right. All right, let's...

1334
01:28:00,145 --> 01:28:01,373
Hello?

1335
01:28:01,546 --> 01:28:03,343
News kind of gets around fast, huh?

1336
01:28:03,515 --> 01:28:05,346
Hello?

1337
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:10,284
GHQ. H... GHQ PX?

1338
01:28:10,455 --> 01:28:12,423
Yes. Yes.

1339
01:28:14,092 --> 01:28:15,889
- Thirty gallons?
- No.

1340
01:28:16,061 --> 01:28:17,722
COD?

1341
01:28:17,896 --> 01:28:19,329
Yes. Right.

1342
01:28:19,497 --> 01:28:20,725
It'll be there.

1343
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:24,596
- Right. Thank you.
- Thirty gallons.

1344
01:28:27,172 --> 01:28:28,400
Let's go to work, huh?

1345
01:28:28,573 --> 01:28:31,804
I don't have to tell you.
Let's go to work.

1346
01:28:31,976 --> 01:28:33,841
Wait!

1347
01:28:34,012 --> 01:28:35,741
Wait.

1348
01:28:35,914 --> 01:28:37,814
Wait.

1349
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:50,287
I've got my cricket.

1350
01:29:08,847 --> 01:29:11,077
Put a label on that one.

1351
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:16,517
Seiko. Seiko, 15O more gallons
to the Naval Officers' Club, Big Koza.

1352
01:29:16,688 --> 01:29:18,986
COD. Take it away.

1353
01:29:19,157 --> 01:29:21,557
Yatoda!

1354
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,161
Hey, Sakini, what are they doing here?

1355
01:29:34,506 --> 01:29:37,202
We're diverting water for a lotus pond.

1356
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:39,036
Can't have a teahouse
without a pond.

1357
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:40,700
Yeah, where's your goldfish?

1358
01:29:40,879 --> 01:29:44,212
You have a lotus pond,
you gotta have goldfish.

1359
01:29:49,421 --> 01:29:50,911
Hey, boss.

1360
01:29:51,089 --> 01:29:55,958
Everyone send me to bring you
to teahouse opening, boss.

1361
01:29:57,228 --> 01:29:58,820
Mac, look. Isn't that something?

1362
01:29:58,997 --> 01:30:00,931
This first-class, boss.

1363
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:03,993
Hey, boy, that's really something, Sakini.

1364
01:30:04,169 --> 01:30:05,898
How about that?

1365
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:07,662
- Well, come on, let's go.
- Lead on.

1366
01:30:07,839 --> 01:30:09,431
Okay.

1367
01:30:56,955 --> 01:30:59,480
Take shoes off, boss.

1368
01:31:14,506 --> 01:31:15,803
Thank you.

1369
01:31:15,974 --> 01:31:17,908
Good evening.

1370
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:22,807
Boss, you sit here.
Lotus Blossom gonna dance in your honor.

1371
01:31:22,981 --> 01:31:25,541
Hey, Mac, you hear that?
She's gonna dance.

1372
01:31:25,717 --> 01:31:28,277
Come on. Sit down, Mac, you farmer.
This is in my honor.

1373
01:31:28,453 --> 01:31:33,015
How can I stall Purdy
so I can stay down here?

1374
01:31:33,191 --> 01:31:35,591
I'll have a relapse for you.

1375
01:35:39,403 --> 01:35:42,065
Chrysanthemum bud
in full bloom now, boss.

1376
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:46,404
And now, happy birthday.

1377
01:35:46,577 --> 01:35:47,839
Very good.

1378
01:35:48,012 --> 01:35:50,276
Well, I'll be.

1379
01:35:51,549 --> 01:35:54,712
- How did you know?
- I gave you away.

1380
01:35:56,053 --> 01:36:00,285
Boss, now everyone like
to show appreciation, boss.

1381
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:06,563
Happy birthday.

1382
01:36:06,731 --> 01:36:09,598
How very lovely you are.

1383
01:36:14,372 --> 01:36:16,704
And a happy, happy to you.

1384
01:36:18,643 --> 01:36:19,871
Yeah.

1385
01:36:31,622 --> 01:36:33,817
Oh, boss, you know what you do?

1386
01:36:34,091 --> 01:36:35,991
It called for flowers, sort of, you know?

1387
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,128
That mean you give your heart to her.

1388
01:36:38,296 --> 01:36:41,129
Well, I do. We all do, huh?

1389
01:36:41,299 --> 01:36:42,994
Wasn't it beautiful, Mac?

1390
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:46,295
<i>She can dance
in my cha ya any day.</i>

1391
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:54,535
Pardon me, sir.

1392
01:36:57,648 --> 01:37:00,845
- Are you sure this is Tobiki village?
- According to the map, sir.

1393
01:37:01,018 --> 01:37:03,816
- The place seems deserted.
- There was a light over there.

1394
01:37:03,988 --> 01:37:05,979
Come on.

1395
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:12,325
What? What is this?
Sakini, what do they want?

1396
01:37:12,496 --> 01:37:17,058
- They want you and doctor to sing song.
- Sing? No.

1397
01:37:17,235 --> 01:37:19,362
All right, come on, come on, Mac.

1398
01:37:19,537 --> 01:37:21,767
Come on, we're gonna sing something.

1399
01:37:21,939 --> 01:37:24,066
How about
"Deep in the Heart of Texas"?

1400
01:37:24,242 --> 01:37:26,472
Why not? There aren't any
Texans here are there?

1401
01:37:26,644 --> 01:37:29,807
We're gonna have some fun now.
Sakini, look. You know, I want...

1402
01:37:29,981 --> 01:37:33,940
They're gonna help. When we clap and sing
"Deep in the Heart of Texas," they join.

1403
01:37:34,118 --> 01:37:37,087
Oh, I know that song.
Very nice, boss. We demonstrate.

1404
01:37:37,255 --> 01:37:39,280
- What is it?
- Stars at night.

1405
01:37:48,966 --> 01:37:51,196
- Deep in the heart of Texas.
- Deep in the heart...

1406
01:37:51,369 --> 01:37:55,135
Deep in the heart of Texas.

1407
01:37:55,306 --> 01:37:56,671
Then we clap four times.

1408
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:01,044
Hey, we're all ready. Hey, we're ready.

1409
01:38:01,212 --> 01:38:04,204
All right. You ready on the left?
Ready on the right. Here we go.

1410
01:38:23,301 --> 01:38:24,598
Yes, sir.

1411
01:38:37,748 --> 01:38:39,340
Captain Fisby!

1412
01:38:44,188 --> 01:38:45,746
What in the name...?

1413
01:38:46,424 --> 01:38:47,550
What?

1414
01:38:48,059 --> 01:38:50,527
I see you, Fisby.

1415
01:38:50,728 --> 01:38:52,855
Fisby, I see you.

1416
01:38:54,732 --> 01:38:57,428
Where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?

1417
01:38:57,601 --> 01:39:01,367
Fisby. Fisby.
Come out here. Come out of here.

1418
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,205
Come out of here.

1419
01:39:08,846 --> 01:39:10,404
Sit down!

1420
01:39:10,581 --> 01:39:14,347
How many lectures have you delivered
to the village children on democratic theory?

1421
01:39:14,518 --> 01:39:17,214
- Well, now, let me see, sir.
- Four, five?

1422
01:39:17,388 --> 01:39:18,878
No, no, no, it wasn't that many.

1423
01:39:19,056 --> 01:39:20,284
- Three?
- No.

1424
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:21,891
Two?

1425
01:39:22,059 --> 01:39:23,287
No, no.

1426
01:39:23,461 --> 01:39:26,294
You've only delivered one lecture?

1427
01:39:26,998 --> 01:39:28,625
None, sir.

1428
01:39:28,799 --> 01:39:31,233
Don't tell me you haven't delivered
a single lecture?

1429
01:39:31,402 --> 01:39:33,996
Yes, sir, I've not delivered no lecture.

1430
01:39:34,171 --> 01:39:35,502
Any lecture.

1431
01:39:35,673 --> 01:39:37,937
Have you organized a League
for Democratic Action?

1432
01:39:38,109 --> 01:39:40,771
Yes, sir, I did that. I sure did.
I sure did that, sir.

1433
01:39:40,945 --> 01:39:43,937
How many lectures on democratic theory
did you give them?

1434
01:39:46,717 --> 01:39:48,981
- None, sir.
- You can't mean none.

1435
01:39:49,153 --> 01:39:52,611
- You must mean one or two.
- No, just none.

1436
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:54,815
- I refuse to believe it.
- I'm very glad, sir.

1437
01:39:54,992 --> 01:39:57,790
- Sir, I must go.
- Where?

1438
01:39:57,962 --> 01:40:00,829
My seedlings are wilting.
I have to transplant them.

1439
01:40:00,998 --> 01:40:06,368
Captain, you'll pack your gear
and transplant yourself to your unit at once.

1440
01:40:06,537 --> 01:40:08,402
Yes, sir.

1441
01:40:09,106 --> 01:40:10,971
They'll die.

1442
01:40:11,575 --> 01:40:13,634
This is murder.

1443
01:40:16,814 --> 01:40:20,807
Please, take care of my beans.

1444
01:40:23,387 --> 01:40:26,948
Now, is the schoolhouse finished?

1445
01:40:27,258 --> 01:40:28,520
No, sir.

1446
01:40:28,692 --> 01:40:30,785
Why isn't it finished?

1447
01:40:31,062 --> 01:40:34,293
Well, we haven't started.

1448
01:40:34,465 --> 01:40:36,899
What did you do with the lumber I sent?

1449
01:40:37,134 --> 01:40:39,602
We built a teahouse.

1450
01:40:40,071 --> 01:40:42,596
I don't suppose
you have any aspirin here?

1451
01:40:44,408 --> 01:40:46,035
l... No, I don't think so.

1452
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:47,802
What in the name of occupation...

1453
01:40:47,978 --> 01:40:50,071
...do you mean by saying
you built a teahouse?

1454
01:40:50,247 --> 01:40:54,775
Lotus Blossom, she had to have a place
to teach the League geisha lessons, sir.

1455
01:40:54,952 --> 01:40:58,388
- Fisby!
- Yes? Yes, sir? What?

1456
01:41:01,859 --> 01:41:03,656
How could you sink
to such depths, man?

1457
01:41:03,828 --> 01:41:07,889
Well, I was only giving in to
what the majority wanted, colonel.

1458
01:41:08,099 --> 01:41:11,762
I don't doubt that statement, not at all.

1459
01:41:11,936 --> 01:41:17,875
It's a sad thing it took a war to convince me
that most of the human race is degenerate.

1460
01:41:18,175 --> 01:41:20,439
I thank my stars I come from a country...

1461
01:41:20,611 --> 01:41:23,102
...where the air is clean,
where the wind is fresh...

1462
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,713
Oh, for heaven's sakes, sir.

1463
01:41:24,882 --> 01:41:27,851
Nothing goes on in a teahouse
that your mother couldn't watch.

1464
01:41:28,018 --> 01:41:31,044
You be careful how you use
my mother's name, Fisby!

1465
01:41:31,222 --> 01:41:33,281
My mother, then, sir.

1466
01:41:33,457 --> 01:41:35,789
Sir, there's nothing immoral
about our teahouse.

1467
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:39,655
Answer me this, what is bringing all that
occupation money to this village?

1468
01:41:43,234 --> 01:41:46,533
- Well, answer it.
- No, no, no. It's nothing, nothing.

1469
01:41:46,704 --> 01:41:49,195
- It might be for me. Answer it.
- It's not, you see...

1470
01:41:49,373 --> 01:41:52,740
- You see, this phone, it rings all day.
- Then I'll answer it.

1471
01:41:52,977 --> 01:41:54,740
Hello?

1472
01:41:56,313 --> 01:41:58,247
What do you want?

1473
01:41:58,916 --> 01:42:00,679
Who is this?

1474
01:42:01,385 --> 01:42:03,649
Commander Myers,
you must have a wrong connection.

1475
01:42:03,821 --> 01:42:06,221
This is not a brewery.

1476
01:42:07,491 --> 01:42:09,186
Yes.

1477
01:42:09,593 --> 01:42:11,220
Yes.

1478
01:42:12,396 --> 01:42:16,560
Yes. Oh, I see.

1479
01:42:16,734 --> 01:42:18,998
I see.

1480
01:42:21,305 --> 01:42:22,636
I see.

1481
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:28,075
Well...

1482
01:42:31,682 --> 01:42:33,946
There was nothing else
that we could make...

1483
01:42:34,118 --> 01:42:36,780
...that anybody would want to buy.

1484
01:42:38,322 --> 01:42:40,017
Brandy.

1485
01:42:41,292 --> 01:42:43,852
This ends my Army career.

1486
01:42:44,495 --> 01:42:48,124
And I promised Mrs. Purdy
I'd come out a general.

1487
01:42:49,433 --> 01:42:53,267
You've broken
a fine woman's heart, Fisby.

1488
01:42:54,305 --> 01:42:56,865
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

1489
01:42:57,041 --> 01:42:59,976
You've sullied the reputation
of your nation and all the tears...

1490
01:43:00,144 --> 01:43:02,772
All right. Shall I kill myself?

1491
01:43:02,947 --> 01:43:05,177
Oh, don't minimize this.

1492
01:43:05,349 --> 01:43:08,477
You don't know the enemy's genius
for propaganda.

1493
01:43:08,886 --> 01:43:13,289
Well, what have you done with
all the money you've made so dishonestly?

1494
01:43:13,457 --> 01:43:15,652
I banked it in Seattle.

1495
01:43:16,894 --> 01:43:19,590
That's despicable.

1496
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:23,266
Making a personal fortune off the labor
of these ignorant people.

1497
01:43:23,434 --> 01:43:26,926
I haven't touched a cent
of this money, colonel.

1498
01:43:27,104 --> 01:43:30,596
Now, it's banked in the name
of the Tobiki Cooperative Company.

1499
01:43:30,774 --> 01:43:34,904
See, everybody in the village,
they're all partners, don't you see?

1500
01:43:35,079 --> 01:43:36,546
You know, share and share alike.

1501
01:43:36,714 --> 01:43:38,978
That's communism!

1502
01:43:39,149 --> 01:43:40,844
It is?

1503
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,821
I'll be lucky to get out
of this war a private.

1504
01:43:49,426 --> 01:43:50,893
- Captain Fisby...
- Yes, sir.

1505
01:43:51,061 --> 01:43:53,154
...you will consider yourself under arrest.

1506
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:55,992
You'll proceed to HQ at once
to await court-martial.

1507
01:43:56,166 --> 01:43:59,932
I intend to wipe this stain
from our country's honor.

1508
01:44:00,104 --> 01:44:02,072
- Gregovich!
- You called, sir?

1509
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,070
I did.

1510
01:44:06,343 --> 01:44:07,970
Yes, sir.

1511
01:44:09,546 --> 01:44:12,481
We have business to attend to here
before going to Awasi.

1512
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:14,550
Yes, sir. I'm glad to hear it.

1513
01:44:14,718 --> 01:44:18,415
Captain, may I congratulate you
on what you've done for this village?

1514
01:44:18,589 --> 01:44:21,319
- It's a dream.
- Thank you, very much, sarg...

1515
01:44:21,492 --> 01:44:23,585
It's an alcoholic dream!

1516
01:44:23,761 --> 01:44:25,786
It's one vast distillery.

1517
01:44:25,963 --> 01:44:29,262
Take a detail and some axes
and smash every still in this village.

1518
01:44:29,433 --> 01:44:31,264
Destroy them?

1519
01:44:31,635 --> 01:44:33,330
Beyond repair.

1520
01:44:33,504 --> 01:44:36,064
Take another detail
and rip down that teahouse.

1521
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:39,073
- But, colonel.
- Pile the lumber beside the road.

1522
01:44:39,243 --> 01:44:41,973
That's an order. Do you understand?

1523
01:44:43,113 --> 01:44:44,705
Yes, sir.

1524
01:45:04,268 --> 01:45:05,496
I know.

1525
01:46:34,992 --> 01:46:37,552
Hot water.

1526
01:47:21,138 --> 01:47:22,730
Boss. Sorry, boss.

1527
01:47:22,906 --> 01:47:24,430
Jeep all loaded now.

1528
01:47:26,577 --> 01:47:28,602
I'll be along in a minute, Sakini.

1529
01:47:29,213 --> 01:47:31,204
You going to take
Lotus Blossom with you?

1530
01:47:32,716 --> 01:47:34,581
Sakini.

1531
01:47:43,961 --> 01:47:49,627
Ask her for me if there's anything
that I can do for her before I go.

1532
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,461
Ask her.

1533
01:48:01,578 --> 01:48:03,512
What did she say, Sakini?

1534
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:06,148
She say she want to marry you, boss.

1535
01:48:07,384 --> 01:48:10,581
Now, why...?
Why would she want to marry me?

1536
01:48:12,289 --> 01:48:15,554
She say you nicest man
she ever seen, boss.

1537
01:48:15,993 --> 01:48:17,221
Oh, no, no, no.

1538
01:48:17,394 --> 01:48:20,386
No. You tell her for me that I'm clumsy.

1539
01:48:20,564 --> 01:48:22,691
I got...

1540
01:48:23,233 --> 01:48:26,259
I got a talent for destruction.

1541
01:48:26,436 --> 01:48:27,960
I'd only disillusion her...

1542
01:48:28,138 --> 01:48:31,665
...just the same way
I disillusioned all her people.

1543
01:48:39,216 --> 01:48:42,674
She say she like to go
to America, boss...

1544
01:48:42,853 --> 01:48:46,949
...where everyone happy, sit around
and sip tea while machine do work.

1545
01:48:47,357 --> 01:48:49,484
Tell her I'll never forget her.

1546
01:48:49,826 --> 01:48:52,351
I'll never forget this village...

1547
01:48:52,529 --> 01:48:55,930
...and on the other side of the world
in the autumn of my life...

1548
01:48:56,099 --> 01:48:59,000
...when an august moon
rises in the east...

1549
01:48:59,169 --> 01:49:01,933
...l'll remember what was beautiful...

1550
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:06,006
...and what I was wise enough
to leave beautiful.

1551
01:49:30,934 --> 01:49:34,267
She say, boss, she never forget you.

1552
01:49:34,671 --> 01:49:39,301
She like you to know that she gonna
make up a long song-story about you...

1553
01:49:39,476 --> 01:49:41,774
...to sing in the teahouse.

1554
01:49:42,179 --> 01:49:45,774
And she say maybe in 100 years
from now...

1555
01:49:45,949 --> 01:49:48,918
...you gonna be famous
all over Okinawa.

1556
01:49:51,355 --> 01:49:54,222
I'd like that. I'd like that.

1557
01:50:16,513 --> 01:50:19,744
Oh, he sure want to push
her wheelbarrow for her, boss.

1558
01:50:22,619 --> 01:50:26,953
She say okay, but not to think
that she's his property.

1559
01:50:32,529 --> 01:50:35,430
He very happy fellow, boss.

1560
01:50:56,486 --> 01:51:00,115
She going now, boss,
but you still her boss...

1561
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:04,351
...so she say she not go
till you drop fan from face.

1562
01:51:56,813 --> 01:52:00,408
I've written a full report of this whole affair
to your commanding officer.

1563
01:52:00,584 --> 01:52:02,575
I'm only glad you don't belong
to my outfit.

1564
01:52:02,753 --> 01:52:04,744
I won't tolerate rotten apples
in my barrel.

1565
01:52:06,723 --> 01:52:08,247
Hello.

1566
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,284
Who?

1567
01:52:12,629 --> 01:52:14,153
What?

1568
01:52:15,165 --> 01:52:16,655
When?

1569
01:52:25,142 --> 01:52:27,975
Sit down, captain. Sit down. Sit down.

1570
01:52:28,879 --> 01:52:30,870
Make yourself comfortable.

1571
01:52:31,748 --> 01:52:33,875
Sit down. Give me your hat.

1572
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:36,382
<i>Have some of these tsukemonos.</i>

1573
01:52:39,689 --> 01:52:42,886
Take your shoes off. I'll be right back.

1574
01:52:51,434 --> 01:52:54,870
- Going now, boss?
- Yeah, I guess so, Sakini.

1575
01:53:01,344 --> 01:53:03,608
Hey, boss, since you
not take Lotus Blossom...

1576
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:06,214
...maybe you take me.

1577
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:08,681
No, Sakini, no.

1578
01:53:08,852 --> 01:53:11,844
I work for you
for half price, boss.

1579
01:53:12,289 --> 01:53:16,157
Major McEvoy is coming down here
to take charge...

1580
01:53:17,327 --> 01:53:20,091
...and, well, he's going to
need your help, you know.

1581
01:53:20,263 --> 01:53:23,460
You very hard man
to bargain with, boss.

1582
01:53:23,633 --> 01:53:26,625
Okay, you want,
I work just for rice ration.

1583
01:53:28,004 --> 01:53:29,232
No.

1584
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:32,406
You mean you gonna make me
work for nothing, boss?

1585
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:37,476
I mean, yes, you're not going to
work for me at all, Sakini.

1586
01:53:37,647 --> 01:53:41,447
- No, you belong here.
- Okay, boss.

1587
01:53:46,356 --> 01:53:50,452
Boss, you know what I think gonna happen
when American leave Okinawa?

1588
01:53:50,627 --> 01:53:51,958
No, what?

1589
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:54,119
I think we gonna have to use...

1590
01:53:54,297 --> 01:53:58,233
...a pentagon-shaped schoolhouse
for teahouse.

1591
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,901
So long, Sakini.

1592
01:54:06,877 --> 01:54:08,572
You're a rare rascal.

1593
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:11,306
So long, boss.

1594
01:54:12,449 --> 01:54:14,076
Say, you know, I'm gonna miss you.

1595
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:19,689
- Hey, boss.
- Yes?

1596
01:54:20,223 --> 01:54:23,158
You not failure.

1597
01:54:27,397 --> 01:54:29,831
I'll tell you something, Sakini.

1598
01:54:30,066 --> 01:54:34,560
You know, I used to worry a lot
about not being a big success.

1599
01:54:34,938 --> 01:54:38,066
I think I felt an awful lot
like you people felt...

1600
01:54:38,241 --> 01:54:40,368
...always being conquered.

1601
01:54:40,777 --> 01:54:43,974
Well, you know,
now I'm not sure who's the conquered...

1602
01:54:45,115 --> 01:54:47,083
...and who's the conqueror.

1603
01:54:47,684 --> 01:54:52,815
I've learned in Tobiki,
the wisdom of gracious acceptance.

1604
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:55,820
See, I don't want to be a world leader.

1605
01:54:56,226 --> 01:54:59,593
I've made peace with myself
somewhere between my ambitions...

1606
01:54:59,763 --> 01:55:01,355
...and my limitations.

1607
01:55:02,098 --> 01:55:04,328
That's good, boss.

1608
01:55:06,436 --> 01:55:09,428
Well, it's a step backward
in the right direction.

1609
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:14,809
Take care.

1610
01:55:15,345 --> 01:55:17,540
Socks up, boss.

1611
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:28,917
Sakini! Sakini!

1612
01:55:29,426 --> 01:55:31,724
Sakini. Sakini.

1613
01:55:31,895 --> 01:55:33,123
Where's Captain Fisby?

1614
01:55:33,863 --> 01:55:35,296
Right over here, boss.
This way.

1615
01:55:35,465 --> 01:55:37,626
- Fisby.
- No, no, over here.

1616
01:55:37,801 --> 01:55:41,703
Fisby. Fisby.
Fisby, come back here at once.

1617
01:55:41,871 --> 01:55:43,532
I'm not in shape.
Too much paperwork.

1618
01:55:43,707 --> 01:55:45,834
- You called, sir?
- I've been looking for you.

1619
01:55:46,009 --> 01:55:49,172
You can't leave. You've got to stay here.
You've got to help me.

1620
01:55:49,346 --> 01:55:50,813
I don't understand, colonel.

1621
01:55:50,981 --> 01:55:53,313
We've got to pull this village
back together again.

1622
01:55:53,483 --> 01:55:55,508
The lid has blown off of everything.

1623
01:55:55,685 --> 01:55:57,915
- Where's Gregovich?
- Well, he... He's out there.

1624
01:55:58,088 --> 01:56:00,488
- They're breaking up the rest of the stills.
- Oh, no.

1625
01:56:00,657 --> 01:56:03,455
- Why? What's the matter?
- I radioed the report to Washington.

1626
01:56:03,626 --> 01:56:05,355
Some fool senator misunderstood.

1627
01:56:05,528 --> 01:56:08,656
He's using this village as an example
of American get-up-and-go...

1628
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:11,494
...in the recovery program.
We're all over the newspapers.

1629
01:56:11,668 --> 01:56:14,193
- That's wonderful, colonel.
- It's not wonderful.

1630
01:56:14,371 --> 01:56:17,431
A congressional committee
is flying over here to study our methods.

1631
01:56:17,607 --> 01:56:20,804
They're bringing photographers
for a magazine spread. Tonight, Fisby.

1632
01:56:20,977 --> 01:56:23,445
- Oh, that's bad, that's bad.
- Gregovich!

1633
01:56:23,613 --> 01:56:26,377
Maybe there's a way we could stall them.
Maybe we could...

1634
01:56:26,549 --> 01:56:28,574
Maybe we could
quarantine the place.

1635
01:56:28,752 --> 01:56:32,313
You can't quarantine a congressman.
They've got immunity or something.

1636
01:56:32,555 --> 01:56:34,386
- Fisby?
- Yeah.

1637
01:56:34,557 --> 01:56:35,683
- Help me.
- Yes, sir.

1638
01:56:35,859 --> 01:56:38,123
I don't ask it for my sake.

1639
01:56:39,496 --> 01:56:41,896
I ask it for Mrs. Purdy.

1640
01:56:43,833 --> 01:56:46,131
I could be a brigadier yet.

1641
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:48,669
Gregovich?

1642
01:56:58,248 --> 01:57:01,274
Gregovich! Gregovich.

1643
01:57:03,019 --> 01:57:04,748
- Gregovich.
- Did you call, sir?

1644
01:57:04,921 --> 01:57:06,946
Come here, come here, Gregovich.

1645
01:57:07,724 --> 01:57:09,954
You haven't destroyed all the stills,
have you?

1646
01:57:10,126 --> 01:57:11,991
No. No, of course you haven't.

1647
01:57:12,162 --> 01:57:14,323
Oh, yes, I have.

1648
01:57:14,731 --> 01:57:17,291
I carried orders out to the letter.

1649
01:57:17,467 --> 01:57:20,925
Why can't somebody
disobey orders once in a while?

1650
01:57:21,104 --> 01:57:24,130
What's happened to
the American spirit of rebellion?

1651
01:57:29,412 --> 01:57:32,176
- Sunstroke?
- Potato brandy, sir.

1652
01:57:34,017 --> 01:57:35,644
Sergeant, wake up.

1653
01:57:36,086 --> 01:57:37,576
Do you hear me? That's an order.

1654
01:57:37,754 --> 01:57:40,882
- Colonel, I'm afraid he's passed out.
- It's desertion.

1655
01:57:41,057 --> 01:57:43,184
I need every man.
Gregovich, get to your feet.

1656
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:45,987
Come on, sergeant.
Come on, sergeant.

1657
01:57:46,162 --> 01:57:47,356
Gregovich.

1658
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:50,397
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Sorry, sir.

1659
01:57:50,567 --> 01:57:53,559
- Stop weaving.
- You're weaving, sir.

1660
01:57:53,736 --> 01:57:55,761
I'm standing perfectly still.

1661
01:57:55,939 --> 01:57:57,804
You smell like a brewery.

1662
01:57:57,974 --> 01:58:00,374
Well, I fell in a vat.

1663
01:58:00,543 --> 01:58:02,977
- You got drunk?
- No, sir.

1664
01:58:03,146 --> 01:58:04,909
I fell in a vat.

1665
01:58:05,081 --> 01:58:09,245
Naturally, I had to open my mouth
to yell for help.

1666
01:58:09,519 --> 01:58:13,319
- Go to the office and sober up at once.
- Yes, sir.

1667
01:58:15,291 --> 01:58:18,089
Oh, sergeant. Sergeant.

1668
01:58:18,261 --> 01:58:19,819
- Fisby.
- Yes, sir?

1669
01:58:19,996 --> 01:58:22,931
- I think I'm going to need you. Stand by.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1670
01:58:25,802 --> 01:58:27,360
No.

1671
01:58:38,348 --> 01:58:41,181
I'm a sinking ship...

1672
01:58:42,418 --> 01:58:45,387
...scuttled by my own men.

1673
01:58:46,122 --> 01:58:47,419
I know.

1674
01:58:47,824 --> 01:58:50,486
- Colonel Purdy.
- Don't bother me.

1675
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:52,355
Stills not all destroyed.

1676
01:58:52,529 --> 01:58:54,588
I haven't got time.

1677
01:58:55,999 --> 01:58:57,523
What did you say?

1678
01:58:57,700 --> 01:58:59,292
We not born yesterday.

1679
01:58:59,469 --> 01:59:02,768
We get the sergeant drunk.
Give him water barrel to break.

1680
01:59:02,939 --> 01:59:04,497
Sakini...

1681
01:59:06,442 --> 01:59:07,932
...my friend.

1682
01:59:08,111 --> 01:59:10,204
You're not saying this
to make me feel better?

1683
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:13,247
No. Stills as good as ever, boss.

1684
01:59:13,416 --> 01:59:15,281
Production not cease yet.

1685
01:59:15,451 --> 01:59:17,476
Sakini, you really are a rascal.

1686
01:59:17,654 --> 01:59:20,589
No, he's really an American.

1687
01:59:20,757 --> 01:59:22,315
He's got get-up-and-go.

1688
01:59:22,492 --> 01:59:25,791
Sakini, if you could get
the people in the village to work together...

1689
01:59:25,962 --> 01:59:28,897
...how long do you think it'd take them
to rebuild the teahouse?

1690
01:59:29,065 --> 01:59:31,761
We not destroy, boss.
We just take away and hide.

1691
01:59:31,935 --> 01:59:33,766
Look, come here.

1692
01:59:38,408 --> 01:59:42,640
Now we going to show you
Okinawan get-up-and-go.

1693
02:00:36,466 --> 02:00:38,366
Be right back.

1694
02:01:29,552 --> 02:01:33,420
It's a land of mystery of the Orient.

1695
02:01:33,589 --> 02:01:36,251
It's... It's beautiful.

1696
02:01:36,426 --> 02:01:37,984
Simply beautiful.

1697
02:01:38,161 --> 02:01:39,492
There's only one thing wrong.

1698
02:01:39,662 --> 02:01:43,223
It needs a sign to tell people what it is.

1699
02:01:43,399 --> 02:01:47,995
And we ought to put another sign up over
there naming this Grace Purdy Avenue...

1700
02:01:48,171 --> 02:01:49,570
...and another sign...

1701
02:01:49,739 --> 02:01:52,333
Sir, how about a nice cup of tea?

1702
02:01:52,675 --> 02:01:55,576
- All right? Come on, colonel.
- All right.

1703
02:01:56,979 --> 02:02:00,710
- Twenty Star for the colonel, Sakini.
- Okay, boss.

1704
02:02:12,195 --> 02:02:14,425
Little story now concluded...

1705
02:02:14,597 --> 02:02:17,532
...but history of world unfinished.

1706
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:22,603
Lovely ladies, kind gentlemen,
go home to ponder.

1707
02:02:22,772 --> 02:02:26,765
What was true at beginning
remains true.

1708
02:02:26,943 --> 02:02:31,539
Pain make man think,
thought make man wise...

1709
02:02:31,714 --> 02:02:34,808
...and wisdom make life endurable.

1710
02:02:35,885 --> 02:02:40,879
So may august moon
bring gentle sleep.

1711
02:02:41,924 --> 02:02:43,414
Sayonara.
