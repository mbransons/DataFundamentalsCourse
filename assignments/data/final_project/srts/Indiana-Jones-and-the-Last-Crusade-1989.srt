1
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,366
Dismount!

2
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:07,075
Herman's horse-sick!

3
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,709
Chaps, no one wander off.

4
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:19,950
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

5
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:33,361
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

6
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,535
What is it?

7
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,292
Alfred, did you
get anything yet?

8
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,300
Nothing.

9
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,358
Then keep digging.

10
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,404
The kid's got something!

11
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,133
Whoo! Yee-hoo!

12
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,197
I got something, Garth!

13
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,835
I got something...
I got something right here.

14
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,941
Oh, look at that!

15
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,179
Whoo!

16
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,221
We're rich! We're rich!

17
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,085
Shut up. Shut up.

18
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:28,385
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

19
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:33,089
Indy...

20
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:34,425
Indy?

21
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:36,192
What are they doing?

22
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,757
Indiana? Indiana?

23
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:40,666
Shh!

24
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:46,000
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

25
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,067
It's the Cross of Coronado.

26
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,738
Cortez gave it to him
in 1520.

27
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,441
Ah! Oh, boy! Whoo!

28
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,983
I'm thinkin' about
raisin' my dead mama,

29
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,485
dig down and put it on
her bony finger!

30
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:59,988
That cross
is an important artifact.

31
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,648
It belongs in a museum.

32
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:03,283
Run back
and find the others.

33
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,693
Tell Mr. Havelock that there are
men looting in the caves.

34
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:07,855
Have him bring
the sheriff.

35
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,762
It's only a snake.

36
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,528
Did you hear what I said?

37
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,000
Right. Run back...

38
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,401
Mr. Havelock...
the sheriff...

39
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,667
What, what are you
gonna do?

40
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,935
I don't know.

41
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,636
I'll think
of something.

42
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,049
Dig with your hands,

43
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,516
not with your mouth.

44
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,059
He's got our thing!

45
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:46,796
-Get him!
-Get off me!

46
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:53,806
Mr. Havelock!

47
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,809
Anybody!

48
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,005
Everybody's lost but me.

49
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,172
There he is!

50
00:04:58,248 --> 00:04:59,806
Let's go! Let's go!

51
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,162
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Dang it!

52
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,302
Hyah! Hyah!

53
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,362
Hey!

54
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,432
Come back here!

55
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,185
Come on! Get him!

56
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,256
Hey, come back here!

57
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,682
Oh!

58
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,081
Aah... Oh!

59
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,091
Here, let me.

60
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,371
Oh, oh...

61
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:38,172
Holy smokes!

62
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,089
Come on, kid.

63
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,096
There's no way out of this.

64
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,785
Hey!

65
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,536
Toss up the whip.

66
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,474
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

67
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,812
It belongs to Coronado.

68
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,146
Coronado is dead,

69
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:58,278
and so are all
of his grandchildren.

70
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:00,686
This should be in a museum.

71
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,746
Now give it back!

72
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,761
A snake!

73
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:07,761
Snake! Aah!

74
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,024
Don't let him get away!

75
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,292
Magic?

76
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,269
Hold it.

77
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,135
Make sure he
doesn't double back.

78
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,219
Okay, kid,
out of the box, now.

79
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:38,992
Son of a...

80
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,730
Damn.

81
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,250
Dad!

82
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,582
Dad!

83
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:09,692
Dad.

84
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:12,860
Dad... Out.

85
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:13,861
It's important.

86
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,557
Then wait.
Count to 20.

87
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:17,065
No, Dad. You listen to me.

88
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,065
Junior!

89
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,567
One, two, three, four...

90
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,570
In Greek.

91
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:37,381
''May he who illuminated this...

92
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,284
illuminate me.''

93
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,625
I brought the sheriff.

94
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:49,295
Just the man I want to see.

95
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,265
Now, there were five
or six of them...

96
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,358
-It's all right, son.
-They came after me...

97
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,561
You still got it?

98
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:54,796
Well, yes, sir.

99
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,395
It's right here.

100
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,133
I'm glad to see that...

101
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,142
because the rightful
owner of this cross

102
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,202
won't press charges
if you give it back.

103
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,772
He's got witnesses,
five or six of them.

104
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,926
Whoo! Yeah!

105
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:32,968
Good day.

106
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,106
You lost today, kid,

107
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:43,949
but it doesn't mean
you have to like it.

108
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,405
Small world, Dr. Jones.

109
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,712
Too small for two of us.

110
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,222
This is the second time

111
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,591
I've had to reclaim
my property from you.

112
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:28,822
That belongs in a museum.

113
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:31,594
So do you.

114
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,361
Throw him over the side.

115
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,650
Grab him, he's getting away!
Stop him!

116
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:19,933
Archaeology is the search

117
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,375
for fact...

118
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:26,375
...not truth.

119
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,041
If it's truth
you're interested in,

120
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,745
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

121
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:33,587
So forget any ideas you've got

122
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,315
about lost cities,
exotic travel,

123
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,585
and digging up the world.

124
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,455
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

125
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:42,020
and ''X'' never, ever,
marks the spot.

126
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,931
Seventy percent
of all archaeology is done

127
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:48,265
in the library.

128
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,306
Research. Reading.

129
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:54,468
We cannot afford
to take mythology

130
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:55,977
at face value.

131
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,875
Next week: ''Egyptology.''

132
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,247
Starting with the excavation
of Naukratis

133
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,842
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.

134
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,944
I will be in my office

135
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:06,386
if anybody's got
any problems,

136
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:07,786
for the next hour
and a half.

137
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,396
Marcus, I did it.

138
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:18,695
You've got it!

139
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:28,240
Oh!

140
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,506
You know how long I've
been looking for that?

141
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,309
All your life.

142
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:33,871
All my life.

143
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,042
Well done, Indy.

144
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:36,778
Very well done, indeed.

145
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,583
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

146
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,588
We can discuss
my honorarium

147
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:44,990
over dinner and
champagne tonight.

148
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:46,221
Your treat.

149
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:47,592
Yes.

150
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,824
My treat.

151
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,163
Dr. Jones!
Dr. Jones!

152
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,608
Shush! Shush! Shush!

153
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,439
Dr. Jones, I am so glad
you're back.

154
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,808
Your mail is on your desk.

155
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,278
Here are your
phone messages.

156
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:06,872
Dr. Jones, you promised...

157
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,314
This is your
appointment schedule,

158
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,409
and these term papers still
haven't been graded.

159
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,317
Okay. Irene,
put everybody's name on a list,

160
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,548
get the order they arrived...

161
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:14,782
Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.

162
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:15,949
Dr. Jones.

163
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,550
...and I'll see each
and every one of them...

164
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:20,095
in turn.

165
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,042
''Venice, Italy.''

166
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:04,503
Dr. Jones!

167
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,813
Dr. Jones?

168
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,827
I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

169
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,869
Uh, my men didn't alarm you,
I hope.

170
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,870
My name is Donovan.

171
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:37,030
Walter Donovan.

172
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:38,334
I know who you are,
Mr. Donovan.

173
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,704
Your contributions
to the museum

174
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,572
over the years have
been extremely generous.

175
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:42,803
Some of the pieces

176
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:44,709
in your collection here
are very impressive.

177
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,509
Well, like yourself,
Dr. Jones,

178
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,379
I have a passion
for antiquities.

179
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,419
Have a look over here.

180
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:54,923
This might interest you.

181
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,927
Well, it's sandstone.

182
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,586
Christian symbol.

183
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,527
Early Latin text.

184
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:05,099
Mid-12th century,
I should think.

185
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,101
That was our
assessment, as well.

186
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,534
Where did this come from?

187
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:09,901
My engineers
unearthed it

188
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:12,031
in the mountain region
north of Ankara

189
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,541
while excavating
for copper.

190
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,576
Can you translate
the inscription?

191
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:22,384
''...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

192
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,716
''will have a... spring

193
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:29,280
''inside him welling up
for eternal life.

194
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,858
''Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

195
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,692
''in the place where you dwell.

196
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:36,857
''Across the desert

197
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,957
''and through the mountain

198
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,059
''to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon,

199
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:44,231
to the temple
where the cup that... ''

200
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:49,907
''Where the cup
that holds the blood

201
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:53,847
of Jesus Christ resides
forever.''

202
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,579
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

203
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:01,646
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

204
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,955
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

205
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,724
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

206
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:10,732
The Arthur legend.

207
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,530
I've heard this
bedtime story before.

208
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:14,931
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

209
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:17,336
The gift of youth to whoever
drinks from the Grail.

210
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,066
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

211
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,167
An old man's dream.

212
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,939
Every man's dream,

213
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:26,038
including your
father's, I believe.

214
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:31,119
Grail lore is his hobby.

215
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:33,178
He's a teacher
of medieval literature.

216
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,450
The one the students hope
they don't get.

217
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:38,550
Walter, you're neglecting
your guests.

218
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:41,187
Be along in a moment, dear.

219
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,429
Hard to resist, isn't it?

220
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:51,871
The Holy Grail's final resting
place described in detail.

221
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,034
What good is it?

222
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,100
This grail tablet
speaks of deserts

223
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:57,805
and mountains and canyons.

224
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,972
It's pretty vague.

225
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:00,982
Where do you want
to start looking?

226
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,814
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

227
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,513
but the entire top portion
is missing.

228
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:06,577
Just the same, an attempt

229
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,589
to recover the Grail
is currently underway.

230
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,721
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

231
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,698
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

232
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,326
it disappeared, and was lost
for a thousand years

233
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:21,733
before it was found again

234
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,795
by three knights
of the First Crusade.

235
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,397
Three brothers, to be exact.

236
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,442
I've heard this one, as well.

237
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:31,309
Two of these brothers walked
out of the desert 150 years

238
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,280
after having found the Grail

239
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:36,250
and began the long journey
back to France,

240
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,343
but only one of them made it.

241
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,888
And before dying
of extreme old age,

242
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,117
he supposedly imparted
his tale

243
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:45,888
to a... to a Franciscan friar,
I think.

244
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:49,089
Not ''supposedly,''
Dr. Jones.

245
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,495
This is the manuscript

246
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:53,558
in which the friar chronicled
the knight's story.

247
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:55,160
It doesn't reveal

248
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,829
the location of the Grail,
I'm afraid,

249
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:57,964
but the knight promised

250
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,338
that two markers, that had been
left behind, would.

251
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,276
This tablet is one
of those markers.

252
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,337
It proves
the knight's story is true.

253
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,474
But as you pointed out,
it's incomplete.

254
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,313
Now, the second marker
is entombed

255
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,047
with the knight's dead brother.

256
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,713
Our project leader

257
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,780
believes that tomb to be located

258
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,883
within the city
of Venice, Italy.

259
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:22,453
As you can now see,
Dr. Jones,

260
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,591
we're about
to complete a great quest

261
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:28,601
that began almost
2,000 years ago.

262
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,137
We're only one step away.

263
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,605
That's usually
when the ground falls out

264
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,335
from underneath your feet.

265
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,038
You could be more right
than you know.

266
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:38,409
Yes?

267
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,812
We've hit a snag.

268
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,443
Our project leader has vanished,

269
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,612
along with all his research.

270
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,983
Uh, we received a cable

271
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,887
from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

272
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,823
who has no idea
of his whereabouts

273
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,224
or what's become of him.

274
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:55,855
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

275
00:21:55,931 --> 00:22:00,334
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

276
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,836
You've got
the wrong Jones,

277
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,236
Mr. Donovan.

278
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,575
Why don't you try my father?

279
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:09,577
We already have.

280
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:12,136
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

281
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,783
Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

282
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:27,123
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

283
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,788
I've watched
the two of you grow apart.

284
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,025
I've never seen you this
concerned about him before.

285
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,364
Dad?

286
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,595
He's an academic;
a bookworm.

287
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:35,795
He's not a field man.

288
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,805
Dad? Dad?

289
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:40,103
Dear God.

290
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:45,405
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

291
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:47,415
I don't know,

292
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:50,077
but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

293
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,086
Dad?

294
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:53,849
It's today's mail,

295
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:56,117
and it's been opened.

296
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:59,126
Mail.

297
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:01,162
That's it, Marcus.

298
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,156
Venice, Italy.

299
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,097
What is it?

300
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,609
It's Dad's Grail diary.

301
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,005
Every clue he followed.

302
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,479
Every discovery he made.

303
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:22,608
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

304
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,212
This is his whole life.

305
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:28,483
Why would he have
sent this to me?

306
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,354
I don't know,

307
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:34,192
but someone must want it
pretty badly.

308
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,232
Do you believe, Marcus?

309
00:23:57,052 --> 00:24:00,852
Do you believe
the Grail actually exists?

310
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:03,221
The search for the Cup of Christ

311
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:06,318
is the search for the divine
in all of us.

312
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:08,022
But if you want facts, Indy,

313
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,496
I've none to give you.

314
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:11,123
At my age, I'm prepared

315
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,293
to take a few
things on faith.

316
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:21,075
Call Donovan, Marcus.

317
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,202
Tell him I'll take
that ticket to Venice now.

318
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,911
I'll tell him
we'll take two.

319
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:35,456
All right, tell me what's going
to happen when we get to Venice.

320
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:37,788
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

321
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,122
-Uh, Schneider?
-I maintain

322
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,855
an apartment in Venice.
It's at your disposal.

323
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,021
Oh, well, that's good.

324
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:44,065
Thank you.

325
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,034
Dr. Jones... good luck.

326
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:48,865
Now be very careful.

327
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:51,030
Don't trust anybody.

328
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,732
Signora?

329
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:27,934
Signorina?

330
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:35,916
Ah, Venice...

331
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:37,212
Yes.

332
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,754
Uh, how will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider

333
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:40,981
when we see him?

334
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,990
I don't know.

335
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:44,355
Maybe he'll know us.

336
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:47,259
Dr. Jones?

337
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:48,421
Yes?

338
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:50,692
I knew it was you.

339
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:53,758
You have your father's eyes.

340
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,170
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

341
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:02,369
Looks like the best parts have
already been spoken for.

342
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,002
Marcus Brody?

343
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,706
That's right.

344
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,078
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

345
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,377
Oh, how do you do?

346
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,544
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

347
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:12,551
He was very close

348
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:14,656
to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

349
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,520
I've never seen him so excited.

350
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:18,389
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

351
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,394
Who? Attila
the Professor?

352
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:21,895
He was never giddy,

353
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:24,159
even when he was
a schoolboy.

354
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,293
Fraulein, will
you permit me?

355
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,461
I usually don't.

356
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:29,868
I usually
don't, either.

357
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:31,064
In that case,
I permit you.

358
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:32,265
It would make
me very happy.

359
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,273
But I'm already sad.

360
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,673
By tomorrow,
it will have faded.

361
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,074
Tomorrow I'll
steal you another.

362
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:37,441
I hate to interrupt you,

363
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,740
but the reason
we're here...

364
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,247
Yes. I have something
to show you.

365
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:42,146
I left your father working
in the library.

366
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:43,479
He sent me to the map section

367
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:45,144
to fetch an ancient plan
of the city.

368
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,415
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

369
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:49,684
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

370
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,726
Roman numerals.

371
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,818
Here is the library.

372
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:56,386
That doesn't look much
like a library.

373
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:59,161
Looks like a
converted church.

374
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:01,168
In this case,
it's the literal truth.

375
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:03,101
We are on holy ground.

376
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:04,638
These columns over here

377
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,833
were brought back
as spoils of war

378
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:10,173
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

379
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:11,712
Now, please excuse me.

380
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,408
The library's closing
in a few moments.

381
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:17,350
I'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

382
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:23,823
Marcus... I've seen
this window before.

383
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,325
Where?

384
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,919
Right here,
in Dad's diary.

385
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,897
You see?

386
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:38,496
Look, Indy.

387
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,564
The Roman numerals.

388
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:42,974
Dad was onto something here.

389
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:44,945
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

390
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:46,742
but we still don't know
what they mean.

391
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,976
Dad sent me this
diary for a reason.

392
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:50,143
Until we find
out why,

393
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,583
I suggest we keep
it to ourselves.

394
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:52,779
Find something?

395
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:54,412
Uh, yes.
Three, seven and ten.

396
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:56,320
That window seems
to be the source

397
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,585
of the Roman numerals.

398
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,058
My God,
I must be blind.

399
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:01,994
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

400
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:03,929
he was looking
for the tomb itself.

401
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,432
Don't you get it?

402
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,229
The tomb is somewhere
in the library.

403
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:09,236
You said yourself
it used to be a church.

404
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:10,532
Look.

405
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,903
Three.

406
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,144
Three.

407
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,371
Seven.

408
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,006
Seven. Ten.

409
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,017
And ten.

410
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:24,644
Now where's the ten?

411
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,280
Look around for the ten.

412
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,457
Three and seven.

413
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,501
Seven and seven

414
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,935
and ten.

415
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:04,215
Ten.

416
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,955
''X'' marks the spot.

417
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,509
Bingo.

418
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,180
You don't disappoint,
Dr. Jones.

419
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:09,883
You're a great deal
like your father.

420
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,585
Except he's lost,
and I'm not.

421
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:12,785
Lower me down.

422
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:24,995
Look after this for me,
will you?

423
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:40,379
Come on.

424
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:49,520
Pagan symbols.

425
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,895
Fourth or fifth century.

426
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:52,058
Right.

427
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,897
600 years before
the Crusades.

428
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,336
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

429
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,168
and burial chambers
centuries later.

430
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,731
That's right.

431
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,073
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

432
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:05,112
that's where we'll find him.

433
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:38,170
What's this one?

434
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:40,271
The Ark of the Covenant.

435
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:41,406
Are you sure?

436
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,882
Pretty sure.

437
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,901
Watch out.

438
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:18,813
It's petroleum.

439
00:32:18,887 --> 00:32:21,651
I should sink
a well down here and retire.

440
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,672
Give me the lighter.

441
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:51,443
Oh, rats.

442
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,543
Ugh!

443
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,131
Come on.

444
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,116
Come here.

445
00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:09,159
Look, it...

446
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,322
it must be one of these.

447
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:11,558
Look at the artistry

448
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:15,227
of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

449
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:32,784
It's this one.

450
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:49,597
This is it.

451
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:51,069
We found it.

452
00:34:53,441 --> 00:34:54,499
Look.

453
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,135
The engraving on the shield,

454
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:01,307
it's the same
as on the Grail tablet.

455
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,648
The shield is the second marker.

456
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,209
What's that?

457
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:08,221
It's a rubbing

458
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:11,224
Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

459
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,852
Just like your father--
giddy as a schoolboy.

460
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:16,487
Wouldn't it be wonderful

461
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:18,623
if he were here now
to see this?

462
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,328
He never would have
made it past the rats.

463
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:23,563
He hates rats.

464
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,969
He's scared to death of them.

465
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:48,360
Get back!

466
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:49,987
Back against the wall.

467
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:55,565
Quick! Under it!

468
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:57,002
Air pocket!

469
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:04,077
Don't wander off.

470
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:05,169
What?

471
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,474
What?!

472
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,061
I think I've found
a way out.

473
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:28,602
Deep breath.

474
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,081
Ah, Venice.

475
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:21,385
Whoa!

476
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,314
Are you crazy?!
Don't go between them!

477
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:59,292
Go between them?
Are you crazy?!

478
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,694
I said go around!

479
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:13,536
You said
go between them!

480
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:15,802
I said,
don't go between them!

481
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,035
No!

482
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:27,338
Why are you
trying to kill us?

483
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:28,973
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

484
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,280
My father was looking
for the Holy Grail.

485
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:32,478
Did you kill him too?

486
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:33,485
No.

487
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:35,283
Where is he?

488
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:37,824
Talk or you're dead.

489
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,484
Damn it, tell me!

490
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,788
Tell me!

491
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:43,490
If you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.

492
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:45,555
Then we'll die.

493
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,669
My soul is prepared.
How's yours?

494
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:51,896
This is your last chance.

495
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,965
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

496
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:13,358
All right, where's my father?

497
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:16,192
If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.

498
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,129
Who are you?

499
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,133
My name is Kazim.

500
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,691
And why were you
trying to kill me?

501
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:23,498
The secret of the Grail

502
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:25,903
has been safe
for a thousand years,

503
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:27,873
and for all that time,

504
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:30,410
the Brotherhood of
the Cruciform Sword

505
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:35,279
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

506
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:38,551
Let me off
at this jetty.

507
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:46,058
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

508
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:49,460
Is it for His glory,
or for yours?

509
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,158
I didn't come
for the Cup of Christ.

510
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,133
I came to find my father.

511
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,603
In that case,
God be with you in your quest.

512
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,539
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

513
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:02,974
on the Austrian-German border.

514
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,084
How's the head?

515
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:15,884
It's better,
now I've seen this.

516
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:18,221
It's the name of a city.

517
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:19,850
''Alexandretta''?

518
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:22,528
Hmm...

519
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:24,462
The knights of the First Crusade

520
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:27,729
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

521
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:30,430
The entire city was destroyed.

522
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,137
The present city of Iskenderun
is built on its ruins.

523
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,343
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said:

524
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,882
''Across the desert
and through the mountain

525
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,077
to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.''

526
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:50,249
But where exactly?

527
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:51,985
Your father would know.

528
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:52,991
Mm.

529
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,494
Your father did know.

530
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:57,087
Look. He made a map.

531
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,928
He must have
pieced it together

532
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,331
from clues
scattered through

533
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:02,198
the whole history
of the Grail quest.

534
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,396
A map with no names.

535
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:05,132
Now, he knew there
was a city

536
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:06,901
with an oasis
due east, here.

537
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:07,963
He knew the course

538
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:09,839
turned south through
the desert to a river,

539
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:11,742
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

540
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:13,279
Straight to the canyon.

541
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:15,815
He knew everything
except where to begin,

542
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:17,510
the name of the city.

543
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:21,045
Alexandretta.

544
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,111
Now we know.

545
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,589
Yes. Now we know.

546
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:25,089
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.

547
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,558
Tell him to meet you
in Iskenderun.

548
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,594
What about you?

549
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:29,061
I'm going after Dad.

550
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:52,419
Elsa?

551
00:42:57,592 --> 00:43:00,527
Elsa? Elsa?

552
00:43:00,595 --> 00:43:02,392
Oh! Oh...

553
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:12,035
My room...

554
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:13,869
Mine, too.

555
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:15,704
What were they
looking for?

556
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:17,243
This.

557
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:18,801
The Grail diary?

558
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:20,403
Uh-huh.

559
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:22,278
You had it?

560
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,181
You didn't trust me.

561
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:26,243
I didn't know you.

562
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,187
At least I let you tag along.

563
00:43:29,257 --> 00:43:30,451
Oh, yes.

564
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,357
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

565
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:36,753
Knock it off. You're not mad.

566
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,298
No?

567
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,596
No. You like
the way I do things.

568
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,727
It's lucky I don't do
things the same way.

569
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:46,432
You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!

570
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:49,032
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

571
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:52,136
Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,

572
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,011
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

573
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:57,607
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

574
00:43:57,685 --> 00:44:00,313
My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.

575
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,320
And until I'm sure,

576
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,947
I'm going to
continue to do things

577
00:44:03,024 --> 00:44:04,821
the way I think
they should be done.

578
00:44:08,262 --> 00:44:11,459
How dare you kiss me!

579
00:44:16,837 --> 00:44:20,170
Leave me alone.
I don't like fast women.

580
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,708
And I hate...

581
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:25,177
arrogant men.

582
00:44:34,622 --> 00:44:36,146
Ah, Venice.

583
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:10,554
What do you know
about this place?

584
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:14,059
I know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

585
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:17,390
What are you going to do?

586
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,557
Don't know.

587
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,929
I'll think of something.

588
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:29,173
Yes?

589
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:30,904
And not before time!

590
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,036
Did you intend to leave us

591
00:45:32,113 --> 00:45:33,444
standing on
the doorstep all day?

592
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:34,481
We're drenched!

593
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:38,344
Now look, I've gone
and caught a sniffle.

594
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:39,511
Are you expected?

595
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:41,919
Do not take that tone
with me, my good man.

596
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,014
Now buttle off
and tell Baron Brunwald

597
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:47,219
that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant...

598
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:50,826
...are here to view
the tapestries.

599
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:51,956
Tapestries?

600
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:53,727
Dear me,
the man is dense.

601
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:55,598
This is a castle,
isn't it?

602
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,102
There are tapestries?

603
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,264
This is a castle,

604
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,934
and we have
many tapestries.

605
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,477
But if you are
a Scottish lord,

606
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:07,480
then I am Mickey Mouse!

607
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:09,641
How dare he?

608
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:39,042
Nazis. I hate these guys.

609
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,053
This one. I think
he's in here.

610
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:55,254
How do you know?

611
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:57,422
Because it's wired.

612
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:27,794
Indy? Indy?

613
00:47:27,862 --> 00:47:30,695
Don't worry...
this is kid's play.

614
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,425
I'll be right back.

615
00:47:55,256 --> 00:47:57,952
Junior?

616
00:47:58,025 --> 00:48:00,323
Yes, sir.

617
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:01,725
It is you, Junior!

618
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,888
Don't call me that,
please.

619
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,296
Well, what are you
doing here?

620
00:48:06,367 --> 00:48:07,994
I came to get you.
What do you thi...?

621
00:48:18,245 --> 00:48:21,271
Late 14th century,
Ming dynasty.

622
00:48:21,348 --> 00:48:23,714
Oh, it breaks the heart.

623
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:26,378
And the head.
You hit me, Dad.

624
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:28,751
I'll never forgive myself.

625
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,222
Don't worry, I'm fine.

626
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:33,487
Thank God.

627
00:48:36,463 --> 00:48:39,455
It's fake.

628
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:43,867
See, you can tell
by the cross section.

629
00:48:44,305 --> 00:48:45,033
No!

630
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,231
Dad, get your stuff.

631
00:48:46,307 --> 00:48:47,934
We've got to get
out of here.

632
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,306
Well, I'm sorry about
your head, though,

633
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:52,402
but I thought you
were one of them.

634
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,970
Dad, they come in
through the doors.

635
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,040
Good point.

636
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:59,517
But better safe
than sorry.

637
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:01,452
Hmm, so I was wrong this time.

638
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,958
But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.

639
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,322
You obviously got it.

640
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:10,822
I got it, and I used it.

641
00:49:10,898 --> 00:49:14,334
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

642
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:15,868
Through the library?

643
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:17,836
Right.

644
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,899
I knew it.

645
00:49:22,977 --> 00:49:24,535
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

646
00:49:24,612 --> 00:49:27,240
Found it.

647
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:30,579
He was actually there?

648
00:49:32,453 --> 00:49:34,045
You saw him?

649
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:37,090
Well, what was
left of him.

650
00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:39,022
And his shield...

651
00:49:39,093 --> 00:49:43,530
the inscription on
Sir Richard's shield?

652
00:49:43,597 --> 00:49:45,565
''Alexandretta.''

653
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:47,930
Alexandretta! Of course!

654
00:49:48,002 --> 00:49:52,234
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

655
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:53,273
Oh...

656
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,242
Junior, you did it.

657
00:49:57,311 --> 00:49:59,575
No, Dad. You did.

658
00:49:59,647 --> 00:50:01,274
Forty years.

659
00:50:01,348 --> 00:50:04,476
Oh, if only I could have been
with you.

660
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:06,382
There were rats,
Dad.

661
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:07,750
Rats?

662
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:09,083
Yeah, big ones.

663
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:11,750
What do the Nazis
want with you, Dad?

664
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:12,985
They wanted my diary.

665
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,391
Yeah?

666
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:17,862
I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me

667
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,364
as I possibly could.

668
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:23,294
Yeah.

669
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,202
Dr. Jones.

670
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,573
Yes?

671
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,378
I will take the book now.

672
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,907
What book?

673
00:50:38,986 --> 00:50:41,386
You have the diary
in your pocket.

674
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,050
You dolt!

675
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,059
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

676
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,095
that he would
bring my diary

677
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:50,755
all the way back here?

678
00:50:51,832 --> 00:50:53,459
You didn't, did you?

679
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:55,900
You didn't bring it,
did you?

680
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:56,901
Well, uh...

681
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,801
You did.

682
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:00,840
Look, can we
discuss this later?

683
00:51:00,908 --> 00:51:02,899
I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

684
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,910
Will you take it easy?

685
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,275
Take it easy?!

686
00:51:06,346 --> 00:51:07,335
Why do you think
I sent it home

687
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:08,346
in the first place?

688
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,848
So it wouldn't fall
into their hands!

689
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:12,010
I came here
to save you!

690
00:51:12,086 --> 00:51:13,018
Oh, yeah?

691
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:15,783
And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?

692
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:16,914
I told you...

693
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:26,331
...don't call me Junior!

694
00:51:28,035 --> 00:51:30,595
Look what you did!

695
00:51:32,573 --> 00:51:34,666
I can't believe what you did...

696
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,111
Elsa? Elsa?

697
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,773
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

698
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,111
Put down the gun,
or the fraulein dies.

699
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,115
But she's one of them.

700
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,481
Indy, please!

701
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:46,484
She's a Nazi.

702
00:51:46,553 --> 00:51:47,485
What?!

703
00:51:47,554 --> 00:51:48,179
Trust me.

704
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:49,950
-Indy, no!
-I will kill her!

705
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,354
Yeah? Go ahead!

706
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:52,619
No! Don't shoot!

707
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,854
Don't worry. He won't.

708
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:56,953
Indy, please! Do what he says!

709
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,521
And don't listen to her.

710
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,465
Enough! She dies!

711
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,902
Wait! Wait...

712
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:12,178
I'm sorry.

713
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:16,307
No, don't be.

714
00:52:27,995 --> 00:52:31,692
But... you should have
listened to your father.

715
00:52:48,982 --> 00:52:50,882
She ransacked her own room,

716
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:52,748
and I fell for it.

717
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,017
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

718
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,021
Hmm?

719
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,082
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

720
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,788
She talks in her sleep.

721
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,036
I didn't trust her.
Why did you?

722
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,702
Because he didn't
take my advice.

723
00:53:24,017 --> 00:53:26,451
Donovan.

724
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,817
Didn't I warn you

725
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:30,322
not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

726
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,324
I misjudged you, Walter.

727
00:53:32,392 --> 00:53:35,850
I knew you would sell your
mother for an Etruscan vase,

728
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:37,920
but I didn't know
you would sell

729
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:39,590
your country
and your soul

730
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,600
to the slime
of humanity.

731
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:45,263
Dr. Schneider...

732
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:47,534
there are pages
torn out of this.

733
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,885
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

734
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:01,477
precise directions
from the unknown city

735
00:54:01,555 --> 00:54:04,217
to the secret Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

736
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,553
So it did.

737
00:54:05,626 --> 00:54:07,491
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

738
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:09,495
We must have
these pages back.

739
00:54:09,563 --> 00:54:10,825
You're wasting
your breath.

740
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:12,092
He won't tell us,

741
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,463
and he doesn't have to.

742
00:54:14,534 --> 00:54:18,470
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

743
00:54:18,538 --> 00:54:20,563
He's given them
to Marcus Brody.

744
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,572
Marcus?

745
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,006
You didn't drag poor
Marcus along, did you?

746
00:54:24,077 --> 00:54:25,567
He's not up
to the challenge.

747
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,579
He sticks out
like a sore thumb.

748
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:28,942
We'll find him.

749
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,176
The hell you will.

750
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,945
He's got a two-day
head start on you,

751
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,316
which is more
than he needs.

752
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:35,719
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

753
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:37,017
from here to the Sudan.

754
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,957
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

755
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,517
He'll blend in, disappear.

756
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:43,153
You'll never see him again.

757
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:47,132
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

758
00:54:47,267 --> 00:54:49,292
Does anyone here
speak English?

759
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,358
Or even ancient Greek?

760
00:54:50,437 --> 00:54:51,870
Uh, water?
No, thank you, sir.

761
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:53,304
No. Fish make love in it.

762
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,567
Goodness me.

763
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:55,573
Thank you so much.

764
00:54:55,642 --> 00:54:56,609
No, I don't like that.

765
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,768
No, I really don't want...

766
00:54:57,844 --> 00:54:59,436
No, no, thank you very much.

767
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:02,209
No, thank you, madam.
I'm a vegetarian.

768
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:05,547
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

769
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:06,779
Mr. Brody!

770
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:08,377
Oh, Sallah.
What a relief.

771
00:55:08,455 --> 00:55:10,548
Marcus Brody, sir.

772
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:11,658
But where is Indy?

773
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,692
Oh, he's in Austria.

774
00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:13,726
A slight detour.

775
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:15,125
You are on your own?

776
00:55:15,195 --> 00:55:16,321
Yes, but don't panic.

777
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,920
Everything's under control.

778
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:20,091
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

779
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:21,099
Oh, yes,
of course.

780
00:55:21,168 --> 00:55:22,294
But where
are we going?

781
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:23,563
Oh, this map will show you.

782
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:25,467
It was drawn by, uh...

783
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:27,507
Mr. Brody.

784
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,565
Welcome to Iskenderun.

785
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:31,577
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

786
00:55:31,712 --> 00:55:32,872
has sent a car for you.

787
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:35,210
Oh, well...
your servant, sir.

788
00:55:35,282 --> 00:55:36,579
And I am his.

789
00:55:36,683 --> 00:55:38,708
Follow me, please.

790
00:55:38,785 --> 00:55:40,776
My reputation precedes me.

791
00:55:40,854 --> 00:55:42,583
There is no museum
in Iskenderun.

792
00:55:42,723 --> 00:55:44,190
Papers, please.

793
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,224
Papers?

794
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:46,316
Of course.

795
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:47,451
Run.

796
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:48,459
Yes.

797
00:55:48,528 --> 00:55:49,961
Papers. Got it here.

798
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,588
Just finished
reading it myself.

799
00:55:51,732 --> 00:55:52,699
Run.

800
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,698
Yes.

801
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,428
''Egyptian Mail,''
morning edition.

802
00:55:55,502 --> 00:55:56,469
Run.

803
00:55:56,536 --> 00:55:57,468
Did you say, uh...

804
00:55:57,537 --> 00:55:58,162
Run!

805
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,478
Okay, okay,
quick, quick, quick!

806
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:17,386
Find the back door!
Find the back door!

807
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,504
Intolerable.

808
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:38,374
Dr. Schneider.
Message from Berlin.

809
00:56:38,445 --> 00:56:40,003
You must return immediately.

810
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,139
A rally at the Institute
of Aryan Culture.

811
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:43,204
So?

812
00:56:43,283 --> 00:56:44,545
Your presence
on the platform

813
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:46,950
is requested
at the highest level.

814
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,578
Thank you, Herr Oberst.

815
00:56:48,722 --> 00:56:50,212
I will meet you
at Iskenderun.

816
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,222
Take this diary

817
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:52,485
to the Reichmuseum
in Berlin.

818
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:53,856
It will show them
our progress,

819
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:54,859
ahead of schedule.

820
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:55,895
Without the map,

821
00:56:55,962 --> 00:56:57,520
I'm afraid it's no
better than a souvenir.

822
00:56:57,597 --> 00:56:58,757
Let me kill them now.

823
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,799
No.

824
00:56:59,866 --> 00:57:02,130
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

825
00:57:02,202 --> 00:57:03,396
we'll need them alive.

826
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:05,836
Always do what
the doctor orders.

827
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,504
Don't look at me like that.

828
00:57:15,582 --> 00:57:17,675
We both wanted the Grail.

829
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:20,743
I would have done
anything to get it.

830
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:22,049
You would have
done the same.

831
00:57:22,122 --> 00:57:24,613
I'm sorry you think so.

832
00:57:34,968 --> 00:57:38,301
I can't forget
how wonderful it was.

833
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,838
Thank you.

834
00:57:39,906 --> 00:57:41,931
It was rather wonderful.

835
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:53,244
Oh, Dr. Schneider.

836
00:57:54,788 --> 00:57:56,312
Your car is waiting.

837
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:06,564
That's how Austrians
say good-bye.

838
00:58:12,606 --> 00:58:16,440
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.

839
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:19,445
Oh!

840
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:26,709
I liked the Austrian way
better.

841
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:28,413
So did I.

842
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:30,353
Let's try and get
these ropes loose.

843
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,948
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

844
00:58:33,026 --> 00:58:35,187
You said he had
two days' start.

845
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,127
That he would blend in.
Disappear.

846
00:58:37,197 --> 00:58:38,892
Are you kidding?
I made that up.

847
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:39,897
You know Marcus.

848
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:41,524
He got lost once
in his own museum.

849
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,727
Oh...

850
00:58:42,802 --> 00:58:46,761
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

851
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,572
What am I looking for?

852
00:58:49,643 --> 00:58:51,167
My lucky charm.

853
00:58:52,712 --> 00:58:54,304
Feels like
a cigarette lighter.

854
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:57,176
Try and burn
through the ropes.

855
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,219
Very good.

856
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:05,649
Oh!

857
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:26,139
I ought to tell you something.

858
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:27,475
Don't get
sentimental now Dad.

859
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:28,946
Save it till
we get out of here.

860
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:30,744
The floor's on fire.

861
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,478
-See?
-What?

862
00:59:32,552 --> 00:59:34,213
And the chair.

863
00:59:34,287 --> 00:59:35,652
Move! Move it out of here!

864
00:59:35,722 --> 00:59:36,746
Go!

865
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,723
It's scorching the table!
Fast!

866
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:39,759
-Move!
-Okay!

867
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,732
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

868
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:58,744
but more important,
we have the map.

869
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:04,946
''By the personal command
of the Fuhrer.

870
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,576
''Secrecy essential to success.

871
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:09,349
Eliminate the American
conspirators.''

872
01:00:09,422 --> 01:00:13,222
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

873
01:00:18,898 --> 01:00:19,830
-Dad!
-What?

874
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:20,831
Dad!

875
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,832
What?

876
01:00:21,901 --> 01:00:22,833
-Dad!
-What?

877
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:24,096
Head for the fireplace!

878
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,159
Oh.

879
01:00:37,183 --> 01:00:39,242
I think I can get
these ropes off.

880
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:41,442
Whoops.

881
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:55,293
Our situation has not improved.

882
01:00:55,368 --> 01:00:57,268
Listen, Dad, I'm almost free.

883
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,750
Alarm!

884
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:24,456
This is intolerable.

885
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:26,996
I'm out, Dad.

886
01:01:27,067 --> 01:01:29,092
Well done, boy.

887
01:02:04,704 --> 01:02:06,103
Come on, Dad.

888
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:14,072
Dead end.

889
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,705
There's got to be a...

890
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:17,579
a secret door or a...

891
01:02:17,717 --> 01:02:20,151
passageway
or something.

892
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,485
I find that if I just
sit down and think...

893
01:02:26,126 --> 01:02:27,718
Dad!

894
01:02:31,631 --> 01:02:33,929
...the solution presents itself.

895
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,105
Great. More boats.

896
01:02:47,147 --> 01:02:48,409
You say this has been

897
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:50,881
just another typical
day for you, huh?

898
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:55,747
No! But better than most.

899
01:02:58,124 --> 01:03:00,058
Come on, Dad. Come on.

900
01:03:00,126 --> 01:03:01,457
What about the boat?

901
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,553
We're not going on the boat?

902
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:19,700
Jones!
