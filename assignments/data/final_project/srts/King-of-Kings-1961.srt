1
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:31,537
And it is written
that in the year 63 B.C...

2
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,579
...the Roman legions,
like a scourge of locusts...

3
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,063
...poured through the east...

4
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:39,817
...laying waste the land of Canaan
and the kingdom of Judea.

5
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:45,152
Rome's imperial armies,
a tumult in the hills...

6
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:48,739
...struck Jerusalem 's walls
in a three-month siege.

7
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:54,078
Breaching the gates, these legions laid
the dust of battle with a shower of blood.

8
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:07,898
Under the eye of General Pompey,
the Holy City fell...

9
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,576
...her people strewn like wheat
in the harvest time of Rome.

10
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:35,366
While Pompey, triumphant...

11
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:38,574
...dared take the last high place...

12
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:40,909
...the still-living heart of the city...

13
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:43,624
...the Temple.

14
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:52,144
Here, on this most sacred ground
in all Jerusalem...

15
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,609
...now Pompey's horse took its way.

16
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:13,274
Where no pagan had ever set foot,
in the court of the priests...

17
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:17,436
...most irreverent Pompey
stood himself down.

18
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:49,619
At last, here was the fruit of the harvest.

19
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:53,372
Here, it was said,
lay the treasure house of Jehovah...

20
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:58,958
great statues of gold,
as bright as the sun in this ancient land.

21
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:05,653
So Pompey,
burning for the touch of precious metals...

22
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,064
...entered the sanctuary.

23
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,769
But entering, Pompey found
only a scroll of parchment...

24
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,985
...a covenant with the one God,
handed down by Moses...

25
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:35,401
...and venerated through the years.

26
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:01,432
Thus, for more than 50 years
after Pompey's invasion...

27
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:06,734
...the history of Judea could be read
by the light of burning towns.

28
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:13,076
If gold was not the harvest...

29
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:15,738
...there was a richness of people
to be gathered.

30
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:21,119
The battalions of Caesar Augustus
brought in the crop.

31
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:28,026
Like sheep from their own green fields...

32
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,480
...the Jews went to the slaughter.

33
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:45,084
They went from the stone quarries
to build Rome's triumphal arches.

34
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,484
But Caesar could find no Jew
to press Rome's laws...

35
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,990
...on this fallen land.

36
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:04,160
So Caesar named one Herod the Great,
an Arab of the Bedouin tribe...

37
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:08,792
...as the new, false,
and maleficent king of the Jews.

38
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:18,438
But from the dust at Herod's feet,
rebellions of Jews rose up.

39
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:22,403
And Herod, in reply, planted evil seeds...

40
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:27,868
...from which forests of Roman crosses
grew high on Jerusalem's hills.

41
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:31,541
And Herod the Great, passing pleased...

42
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,033
...bade the forest multiply.

43
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:43,150
Yet, trapped in this darkness,
the Jews survived...

44
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,440
...by one promise.'

45
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:49,782
God would send the Messiah
to deliver them forth.

46
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,234
And it came to pass in those days...

47
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:02,062
...that a decree went out
from Caesar Augustus...

48
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:04,568
...that all the world should be taxed.

49
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:08,401
And all went to be taxed,
everyone into his own city.

50
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:10,987
So it was that Joseph, a carpenter...

51
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,448
...went up from Galilee,
unto Bethlehem...

52
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,534
...to be taxed
with his espoused wife, Mary...

53
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:18,791
...who was with holy child.

54
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:24,056
He found his own city
much corrupted by Rome.

55
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,832
Are you the innkeeper?

56
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:48,856
There is no room. No room,
not even for a fly to squeeze in.

57
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:53,277
Please, it's not for me. It's for my wife.
She's expecting a child.

58
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:55,984
You can find a place in the street.

59
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,074
She's expecting her child tonight.

60
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:03,697
Uh, maybe I can give you a stall
in the stable.

61
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:16,310
We will have to
spend the night in the stable.

62
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:27,534
Now, when this holy child
was born in Bethlehem of Judea...

63
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:31,075
...three wise men came from the east.

64
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:35,893
These were Caspar,
Melchior and Balthazar...

65
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:38,729
...of Mesopotamia, Persia and Ethiopia.

66
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,489
A king of Judea, born in a stable?

67
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,574
What kind of mockery is this?

68
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:28,497
Herod is the only king in Judea.
Who is this pretender?

69
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,034
Is there something in your scriptures...

70
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,325
...about a new messiah
being born at this time?

71
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:39,192
False messiahs are born
under every cloud, Your Majesty.

72
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:42,979
What shall we do, my son?

73
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:49,160
You are my king, Father.
It is for you to command.

74
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:50,365
Lucius...

75
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:57,377
...order all newborn male children
in that town put to the sword.

76
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:00,397
That is my command, Lucius.

77
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:03,897
I am a Roman soldier.

78
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,063
I do not murder children.

79
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:10,529
You are in my service
by command of Caesar.

80
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:12,617
Dare you disobey Caesar?

81
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,532
Mary, Mary...

82
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,167
...while I slept, I heard a voice saying:

83
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:48,306
"Take the child and his mother,
flee into Egypt...

84
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:51,351
...and stay there until you are told
to return."

85
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:58,070
Then we will go.

86
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:13,224
And so,
when Joseph and Mary fled into Egypt...

87
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,985
...Herod's men,
seeking all newborn sons...

88
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:20,443
...did slaughter
the innocents of Bethlehem.

89
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:33,751
Not my son!

90
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:42,228
Help me!

91
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,154
I cannot breathe.

92
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:57,649
Help me to my throne.

93
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,746
A king who cannot walk to his own throne
is no longer a king, Father.

94
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:19,484
Put me on my throne.

95
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:22,650
I will not die on my knees.

96
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:40,147
So Herod the Great,
crushed by his many murders...

97
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:43,404
...self-crucified, fell dead.

98
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:48,660
And Herod Antipas
took murder for his crown.

99
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:53,406
And so it was that with Herod's death...

100
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:57,792
...Joseph brought his family out of Egypt,
and betook them to Nazareth...

101
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:02,100
...where the years passed, numbering 12.

102
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:09,239
- You are Joseph, the carpenter?
- Yes.

103
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:12,072
My camel litter needs repair.

104
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:14,111
I'll look at it.

105
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:17,240
- Peace be to you.
- And to you.

106
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:20,080
- Refresh yourself.
- Thank you.

107
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:24,351
- Your son?
- Yes.

108
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:27,563
And does he like being a carpenter?

109
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:30,441
Yes, he does.

110
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:34,362
There's a big world outside this garden,
do you want him to see it?

111
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:41,452
He will see it soon enough.

112
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:46,113
Let me take him with me.
I'll pay you well.

113
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,309
I could use a lad like that
to help me with my caravan.

114
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:55,071
No. Someday he will leave me...

115
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,319
...but someone else will call him.

116
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:58,653
And who will that be?

117
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:03,237
My son will know him when he comes.

118
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,207
- I can mend it by tomorrow.
- Good.

119
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,648
Have no fear.

120
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:17,061
We're simply checking the census
against the tax rolls.

121
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:19,688
Now, you are...

122
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:21,068
...Joseph.

123
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:24,698
- And you live here with your wife, Mary.
- That is so.

124
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:26,244
Who's this boy?

125
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,872
My son, Jesus.

126
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,829
I have no record of his birth.
When was he born?

127
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:36,314
Twelve years ago.

128
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:38,770
- Where?
- In Bethlehem.

129
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,367
Bethlehem.

130
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:02,729
Count those in the next house.

131
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:10,949
See that the boy is registered
before the year is out.

132
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:20,543
Thus, Joseph's family
were once more forgotten.

133
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:23,180
Twenty years passed.

134
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:27,146
And Pontius Pilate,
new governor of Judea...

135
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:30,187
...brought fresh armies south and east.

136
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:35,742
But in the hills,
10,000 rebel Jews la y hidden.

137
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,200
Their leader, Barabbas,
wanted as criminal and killer...

138
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:42,457
...now baited his traps
for the Roman wolves.

139
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:59,283
There's too many of them, Barabbas.

140
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:01,364
We will divide them.

141
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,780
- There's a water sign on the hill.
- Make sure it's safe.

142
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,940
There's fresh water ahead, sir.

143
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:05,853
- Shall I give the men a rest?
- Not too long.

144
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:08,522
Take one column to the waterhole.

145
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:10,066
Column 1, follow me.

146
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:15,742
Columns, rest!

147
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,738
Give me some wine.

148
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:00,284
How much farther is Jerusalem?

149
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:02,157
Another day's journey.

150
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,119
You should drink water, my husband.
Wine only increases the thirst.

151
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,285
I enjoy it.

152
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,939
Judea. A fine wedding present
your father gave me.

153
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,908
My dear Pontius...

154
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:28,122
...it is said whoever can govern Jerusalem
can govern anywhere, even Rome.

155
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:32,956
Do you think Tiberius really has me
in mind as his successor in Rome?

156
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:37,231
I wish I knew my father's mind...

157
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,485
...as well as I know
my husband's ambition.

158
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:52,371
And Herod Antipas
rode out to meet Pontius Pilate...

159
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,498
...and show him the way to Jerusalem.

160
00:26:58,637 --> 00:27:01,937
Another troublemaker. Who is this one?

161
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:04,101
This one is called John the Baptist.

162
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:07,943
He preaches to the people to repent
before the coming of the Messiah.

163
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:10,699
I baptize you with water.

164
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:14,987
But one mightier than I
shall come after me.

165
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:18,579
And he shall baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

166
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:25,064
One more messiah on the way.

167
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:28,147
Will these Jews never tire
of inventing deliverers?

168
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,069
I have heard that name, John the Baptist.

169
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:40,330
I hear he speaks evil things of me
wherever he goes.

170
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:44,163
His heart should be ripped
from his body.

171
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,849
Your daughter, Herodias,
grows more like her mother day by day.

172
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:53,102
Do I not please you?

173
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:57,573
My stepdaughter
pleases me very much, Salome.

174
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:07,996
Lucius, keep your eye on this man.

175
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:10,971
One day you'll have to arrest him.

176
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:14,478
- On what grounds?
- On my orders.

177
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:19,572
I'm bound only to take orders from
the Roman governor when he arrives.

178
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:23,984
Tell me, Lucius,
what manner of man is Pontius Pilate?

179
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:26,245
How should I treat him?

180
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:28,446
What is his weakness?

181
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:31,241
Vanity.

182
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:19,241
Call the others to return!

183
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,059
Legions, all stand!

184
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:03,859
Barabbas! Barabbas!

185
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:05,485
Barabbas!

186
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,314
- Who are these men? Bandits?
- They call themselves patriots.

187
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,323
A man named Barabbas leads them.

188
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:12,242
Have you captured him?

189
00:33:12,401 --> 00:33:14,699
This land is filled with caves
and hidden valleys.

190
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:17,365
It'd take half the legions of Rome
to ferret them out.

191
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:19,875
I want him in chains
before the end of the year.

192
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,728
Putting him in chains would be easy...

193
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,764
...but putting our hands on him...

194
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:26,854
...that's what's difficult.

195
00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:32,321
I baptize you with water.

196
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,909
But one mightier than I shall come.

197
00:33:37,068 --> 00:33:41,699
And he shall baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

198
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:48,602
Are you Elijah?

199
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:52,230
No, I am not.

200
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:53,978
Are you the Messiah?

201
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:58,566
No, I am not.

202
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:02,074
I am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness.

203
00:34:02,695 --> 00:34:05,790
The Messiah is one
who will come after me.

204
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,726
You are welcome.

205
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,147
Peace be on this house.

206
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:33,486
What would you have of me?

207
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,902
I seek your son.

208
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:40,742
My son has gone into the desert.

209
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:43,492
Why did he come to the river?

210
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:46,809
For you to baptize him.

211
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:52,647
He is without sin.
How could I baptize him?

212
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,914
I preach in the wilderness...

213
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:08,411
...but the Word must be brought
to Jerusalem.

214
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:11,896
Yet I know I am not the one to deliver it.

215
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:14,558
Only he can.

216
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,775
When his time comes...

217
00:36:20,897 --> 00:36:22,319
...he will be there.

218
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:24,909
You say that with sadness.

219
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:27,912
And joy.

220
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:11,734
And Jesus, baptized...

221
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,700
...returned from Jordan,
and went into the wilderness.

222
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:19,078
And with the baptism,
the Holy Spirit came upon him...

223
00:37:19,241 --> 00:37:21,599
...and a voice said to Jesus:

224
00:37:21,763 --> 00:37:25,891
"Thou art my beloved son,
in thee I am well pleased."

225
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:29,565
And Jesus knew the wilderness...

226
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:31,900
...its day of heat...

227
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,448
...its night of cold and solitude.

228
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,238
And stayed himself there
to commune with God...

229
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:43,158
...and strengthen himself
for the times to come.

230
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:46,429
And ate nothing and hungered.

231
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:49,474
And brought his soul forth in the light...

232
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,608
...to be seen of himself and known.

233
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:02,408
And was 40 days tempted of the devil.

234
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,782
Behold. I am here.

235
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:11,354
Come. I command you.

236
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:16,939
Come. Be tried and found wanting.

237
00:38:18,478 --> 00:38:23,154
If you are the Son of God, command
these stones that they be turned to bread.

238
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,164
Man does not live by bread alone...

239
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:32,859
...but by every word of God.

240
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:08,822
Behold.

241
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:14,328
I show you all the kingdoms of the world,
in a moment of time.

242
00:39:16,572 --> 00:39:19,913
All this will I give you,
and the glory of them.

243
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:23,772
If you will worship me,
all shall be yours.

244
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,811
Lo! Come to this high place.

245
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:22,028
If you are the Son of God,
cast yourself down from here.

246
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,696
For will not his angels save you
from falling and prevent your death?

247
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,702
Come to the high place.

248
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,270
Be gone!

249
00:40:35,805 --> 00:40:39,651
I worship the Lord my God...

250
00:40:41,227 --> 00:40:44,322
...and only to him do I do service.

251
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,406
Come!

252
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:52,280
Come, if you will...

253
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:57,642
...but I shall not call upon
the Lord my God to stop you.

254
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:07,147
You shall not force me to put
the Lord my God to the proof.

255
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:15,162
And when the devil had ended
all his temptations, he departed away.

256
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:30,024
And Jesus came out of the wilderness,
and was seen by men.

257
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:42,741
There is your new rabbi.
He is the Lamb of God.

258
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,274
And Jesus called those of his choice.

259
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:57,907
And two of the chosen
were John and Andrew...

260
00:41:58,065 --> 00:42:00,488
...and they followed where he led.

261
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:07,078
And Jesus took himself down
by the Sea of Galilee.

262
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,064
And there did name his third apostle,
and summon him forth on land.

263
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:18,020
Simon! Simon, you have been chosen!

264
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:26,324
You are Simon.

265
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:31,819
You shall be called Peter, the rock...

266
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,392
...upon which I will build.

267
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,980
What will you have me do, Rabbi?
I am just a fisherman.

268
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:44,238
Come with me...

269
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:46,984
...and I will make you a fisher of men.

270
00:42:59,888 --> 00:43:01,561
Attention.

271
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:22,645
I have just made a tour of the city.

272
00:43:23,638 --> 00:43:26,482
I found no statues, no banners...

273
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:29,269
...no emblems of Caesar anywhere.

274
00:43:29,435 --> 00:43:31,108
Where are they?

275
00:43:32,564 --> 00:43:34,783
The Jews have only one god.

276
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:38,863
Their law forbids
the presence of any image.

277
00:43:40,321 --> 00:43:42,574
Where are the chests
I brought from Rome?

278
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:45,561
Open them.

279
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:13,728
A good likeness of Tiberius, is it not?

280
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,564
Surely they dare not object
to the emperor's image.

281
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,271
Hmm.

282
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:21,447
These people can.

283
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:23,358
Their law is their religion.

284
00:44:24,693 --> 00:44:27,572
Place them on the pillars of their Temple.

285
00:44:30,407 --> 00:44:33,061
Behold. The sign of the pagan.

286
00:44:33,553 --> 00:44:36,432
As God overthrew
Sodom and Gomorrah...

287
00:44:36,597 --> 00:44:40,397
...so shall He send hosts
to destroy the idol-worshipers.

288
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:44,776
The day is coming when the sword
shall descend upon her legions.

289
00:44:45,106 --> 00:44:48,360
Her mighty kings and princes
shall grow feeble.

290
00:44:48,526 --> 00:44:51,450
Her stolen treasures made worthless.

291
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:54,989
Her cities shall crumble into dust.

292
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,896
We shall raise our voice...

293
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:01,227
...and be heard.

294
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,813
- Take down the plaques!
- Take down the plaques!

295
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:06,354
Take down the plaques!

296
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,692
Take down the plaques!

297
00:45:08,147 --> 00:45:11,697
When he comes,
he will clear the threshing floor...

298
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:14,783
...and gather the grain into his barn.

299
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,697
But the chaff...

300
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:20,072
...he will burn with unquenchable fire.

301
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:23,730
The shepherds
who lead their flocks astray...

302
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:26,937
...shall be cast out.

303
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:30,028
The high shall fall.

304
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,360
- Make him stop.
- And the fallen shall rise.

305
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:34,524
Draw the curtains.

306
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,160
The cry of the wicked shall fall upon ....

307
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,491
It's a very strange voice.
Who is that man?

308
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,747
Just another prophet.

309
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,113
An agitator.

310
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,060
Must he agitate beneath your
palace window? Send him away.

311
00:45:48,222 --> 00:45:50,395
The harangue is directed against you...

312
00:45:50,558 --> 00:45:53,232
...for mounting graven images
on our Temple walls.

313
00:45:53,394 --> 00:45:57,695
- The incidents in Caesarea were bad.
- The plaques stay.

314
00:45:59,024 --> 00:46:00,321
Do something about this man.

315
00:46:01,026 --> 00:46:02,699
He is harmless.

316
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:06,036
He gives the people
the type of entertainment they want.

317
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:08,187
It is not wise to molest him.

318
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,186
My husband is afraid of that madman.

319
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,892
He thinks he's a holy man.

320
00:46:13,557 --> 00:46:16,060
A holy man
who speaks words of treason.

321
00:46:16,226 --> 00:46:19,901
Caiaphas. You are the high priest
in that man's house of God.

322
00:46:20,063 --> 00:46:21,565
Do you not punish such conduct?

323
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:26,825
Punishment does not dampen their ardor,
rather it increases their wrath.

324
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:30,914
We have found it wiser to ignore
the ravings of these false prophets...

325
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,897
...than to persecute them.

326
00:46:33,636 --> 00:46:36,014
In my opinion,
this man seeks martyrdom.

327
00:46:36,222 --> 00:46:38,941
I will put a stop to his voice tomorrow.

328
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,229
Tomorrow. Oh, you've been saying that
ever since he came from Jerusalem.

329
00:46:42,395 --> 00:46:44,397
I have given my word.

330
00:46:45,231 --> 00:46:47,575
The word of a king or a puppet?

331
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:52,580
And strip the clothes of the slaves,
and make them go naked.

332
00:46:53,156 --> 00:46:54,248
Men groan...

333
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:58,847
- ...and the souls of the oppressed--
- Go away, you vile man!

334
00:47:02,558 --> 00:47:04,560
Daughter of adultery...

335
00:47:05,477 --> 00:47:08,196
...there is but one that can save you.

336
00:47:08,522 --> 00:47:10,399
Go seek him out.

337
00:47:11,608 --> 00:47:15,738
Kneel at his feet and ask forgiveness
for the sins of your mother.

338
00:47:15,904 --> 00:47:19,277
That man is no prophet.
He wears the rags of a beggar.

339
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:21,723
- It is best to ignore him.
- Ignore him?

340
00:47:21,886 --> 00:47:24,059
There is only one way
to deal with a beggar.

341
00:47:24,222 --> 00:47:27,066
You! You, there! Speaker!

342
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,102
Step forward!

343
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,180
You have your alms. Now, be gone!

344
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:57,356
Bring the beggar in.

345
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:09,557
When your legions under Pompey
invaded our land...

346
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:11,892
...they slew all the priests in the temples.

347
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,559
Since then, we have received
our priesthood appointments from Rome.

348
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:20,105
The people have little love
for any man appointed by your emperor.

349
00:48:31,772 --> 00:48:34,262
At night the thief goes out...

350
00:48:35,388 --> 00:48:38,312
...in darkness he digs under the house....

351
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,610
Stop! Hold your peace.

352
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:49,077
- Come with me.
- Take me...

353
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:52,239
...but you cannot stop him
who comes after me.

354
00:48:52,405 --> 00:48:56,359
We will worry about that when it happens.
Come, you foolish man.

355
00:49:18,612 --> 00:49:21,720
Tell me, what is your occupation?

356
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:26,566
I do the bidding of the Lord, my God.

357
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:29,652
Judging from your appearance...

358
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:33,065
...your god seems to be
a rather unprofitable master to serve.

359
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:37,486
I do not seek my reward
in the world you live in.

360
00:49:38,361 --> 00:49:41,205
Nevertheless, you will find one here.

361
00:49:41,656 --> 00:49:45,353
Yes, we do live in a very wicked world.

362
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:51,566
You frighten me, you angry man.

363
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:53,148
Salome, come back!

364
00:49:56,313 --> 00:49:59,192
This beast amuses me.

365
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:01,326
Make him dance...

366
00:50:01,485 --> 00:50:03,453
...on a bed of hot coals.

367
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,764
It were better to cut
his vicious tongue from its roots.

368
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,854
Woman...

369
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:14,729
...is not your cup of abominations
full enough?

370
00:50:16,476 --> 00:50:18,399
You dare to say that to my face?

371
00:50:19,396 --> 00:50:23,196
Get down on your knees
and beg my forgiveness!

372
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:25,076
You, woman?

373
00:50:25,902 --> 00:50:29,122
Who has given herself
to the captains of Assyria?

374
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:31,944
To the young men of Egypt?

375
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:35,514
Who has deserted the bed
of her first husband...

376
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,729
...to live in incestuous lust
with his brother?

377
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:47,946
Is there blood in your veins...

378
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:50,202
...or poison?

379
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:57,220
Lucius, break his skin with your sword.

380
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:02,440
I want to see.

381
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,728
Our supper grows cold.

382
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:08,397
Do you intend to do nothing
with this man?

383
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:13,486
Herod, Pilate has asked you a question.

384
00:51:17,656 --> 00:51:19,240
Lucius...

385
00:51:20,018 --> 00:51:22,228
...take this man to the dungeon.

386
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:44,681
Would you like me to come
and visit you in your new cave?

387
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,394
You are the seed of evildoers...

388
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:51,316
...the child of corruption.

389
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:54,187
Leave this house of darkness.

390
00:51:54,562 --> 00:51:57,907
Find your way into the light
while there is yet time.

391
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:06,076
But if some were imprisoned in this day...

392
00:52:06,238 --> 00:52:09,516
yet many another was set free
from the illness of their bodies.

393
00:52:10,387 --> 00:52:14,893
It was the time of miracles,
and Jesus put forth his hand...

394
00:52:15,058 --> 00:52:19,359
...and cleansed those who were vexed
with unclean spirits.

395
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:24,235
For there went virtue out of him,
and healed them all.

396
00:54:59,888 --> 00:55:02,141
I thought you would
leave me here to starve.

397
00:55:03,976 --> 00:55:06,024
What took you so long?

398
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:09,862
A new prophet has come to Jerusalem.

399
00:55:10,023 --> 00:55:13,527
He has the same first name
- Jesus.

400
00:55:15,404 --> 00:55:17,995
We need more fighters
and fewer prophets...

401
00:55:18,153 --> 00:55:21,603
...except for John the Baptist.
If I had that man on my side...

402
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,560
...I could wake up the people,
and we would rid ourselves...

403
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:26,224
...of Antipas and the Romans.

404
00:55:26,891 --> 00:55:29,144
This man is greater
than John the Baptist.

405
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,567
In what way?

406
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,857
I talked with one of his disciples.

407
00:55:35,316 --> 00:55:37,284
This Jesus...

408
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:42,488
...was proclaimed by John the Baptist
as the man he was waiting for.

409
00:55:48,097 --> 00:55:50,896
I need a prophet
to help me win over the people.

410
00:55:51,058 --> 00:55:52,230
Can we convince this man?

411
00:55:53,894 --> 00:55:56,113
His disciple
says he speaks only of peace.

412
00:56:04,446 --> 00:56:05,945
Peace?

413
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:09,846
There will be no peace in Jerusalem,
unless it is won by the sword.

414
00:56:16,518 --> 00:56:18,737
It's not safe for you on the street.

415
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:22,741
I must speak with this man.

416
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:35,563
What does a man profit,
if he shall gain the whole world...

417
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,399
...and lose his own soul?

418
00:56:38,558 --> 00:56:41,812
Could you explain the parable
of the tares of the fields?

419
00:56:42,228 --> 00:56:46,904
He that soweth the good seed
is the Son of Man.

420
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:49,785
And the field is the world.

421
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:58,680
We are strangers in your city.
We seek one called John the Baptist.

422
00:56:59,054 --> 00:57:00,681
Can you tell us where to find him?

423
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,311
She's evil. Stone her!

424
00:57:19,476 --> 00:57:21,970
- Stone her!
- She's a harlot. She must die!

425
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:23,850
She's evil. Stone her!

426
00:57:25,265 --> 00:57:27,893
- Let her be stoned. She must die.
- She's an adulteress.

427
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:29,686
What has this woman done?

428
00:57:29,853 --> 00:57:33,323
She's been caught in adultery, and
she must be stoned according to the law.

429
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:36,242
She's a harlot. She must die!

430
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:39,655
- Let her be stoned!
- She must die!

431
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:42,363
- She's a harlot. She must die!
- She must die!

432
00:57:42,523 --> 00:57:46,513
Then let him who is without sin
amongst you cast the first stone.

433
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:30,855
Woman, where are they now
who condemned you?

434
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:36,560
Then neither will I condemn you.

435
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,560
Go and sin no more.

436
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:52,534
If you would find John the Baptist,
he lies in the palace dungeon.

437
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:55,356
- What was his crime?
- He told the truth.

438
00:58:56,511 --> 00:59:00,515
He may be the one we have waited for.

439
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:04,522
I must speak with him.

440
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:27,400
And, Barabbas, so near to Jesus...

441
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:30,654
...now turned and fled
from the Roman guards.

442
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:35,442
Leaving behind a man
seeking answers from one stone...

443
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:39,158
...whether to run with Barabbas,
the messiah of war...

444
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,400
...or walk with Jesus,
the new messiah of peace.

445
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:52,726
What is it?

446
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,563
Another one wants
to see John the Baptist.

447
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:58,448
- Send him away.
- He will not go.

448
00:59:58,607 --> 01:00:01,201
I mean, I do not know
how to send this one away.

449
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,325
Show him in.

450
01:00:15,058 --> 01:00:17,527
The prisoner, John,
is not allowed visitors.

451
01:00:18,603 --> 01:00:21,322
If you wish to send him a message,
leave it with the guard.

452
01:00:21,982 --> 01:00:23,404
I would see John.

453
01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:26,156
Why?

454
01:00:28,947 --> 01:00:30,688
I come to free John.

455
01:00:32,802 --> 01:00:36,056
And just how do you propose
to break him free from his cell?

456
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:40,189
I come to free him within his cell.

457
01:00:43,062 --> 01:00:46,532
Freedom? Behind stone walls?

458
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,904
You are free to come and go
as you please...

459
01:00:51,362 --> 01:00:53,113
...and yet you are still a prisoner...

460
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:56,636
...because you place no faith
in anything but your sword.

461
01:01:06,854 --> 01:01:10,028
Who are you? Where do you come from?

462
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:13,035
My name is Jesus. I come from Nazareth.

463
01:01:13,861 --> 01:01:15,408
Nazareth?

464
01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:19,399
I have not been there for many years...

465
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,221
...yet your face is familiar.

466
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,727
You once came to our house
and spoke to my mother.

467
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,817
The house of the carpenter?

468
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:36,910
Hmm.

469
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:42,902
For some reason unknown to me,
I have favored your mother once before.

470
01:01:49,056 --> 01:01:51,684
I will give you a moment
with the prisoner, John.

471
01:01:51,851 --> 01:01:53,728
But remember this:

472
01:01:53,894 --> 01:01:58,741
As you have your duty to your god,
so do I to my emperor.

473
01:01:58,899 --> 01:02:01,072
Break Caesar's law...

474
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,863
...and you shall find in me
the most merciless of all men.

475
01:02:05,858 --> 01:02:07,350
Ichebious.

476
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:13,061
Let him take a look at the baptizer.

477
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:32,352
John.

478
01:03:07,896 --> 01:03:09,569
Give me your blessing.

479
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,279
The name of Jesus
moved through the land...

480
01:04:06,436 --> 01:04:08,301
...and yet others came to walk with him.

481
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:11,472
And they were Philip and Bartholomew.

482
01:04:11,638 --> 01:04:14,312
And one more joined them near the city.

483
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:20,405
Take me with you, Rabbi.

484
01:04:22,399 --> 01:04:23,742
Come.

485
01:04:29,234 --> 01:04:31,021
What is your name?

486
01:04:31,182 --> 01:04:32,427
Judas.

487
01:04:32,593 --> 01:04:34,061
- And yours?
- John.

488
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:36,560
He's mad!

489
01:04:36,722 --> 01:04:39,066
He's a madman! Madman!

490
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:49,185
You are his mother?

491
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,688
Yes. Who has sent you?

492
01:05:52,893 --> 01:05:56,067
I have journeyed from Jerusalem
to see where he lives.

493
01:05:58,232 --> 01:06:00,360
Come, I will show you.

494
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:03,033
I am alone now. Share my table.

495
01:06:04,321 --> 01:06:05,904
I am a woman of sin.

496
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:11,980
You will share my table.

497
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:20,902
I have done much evil.

498
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,121
Child, God knows evil exists,
as well as good.

499
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:30,568
Just as there is light and darkness.

500
01:06:31,223 --> 01:06:35,313
Evil exists that we may be
the better for it.

501
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:38,065
Will you speak to your son for me?

502
01:06:46,732 --> 01:06:48,734
Intercede.

503
01:06:56,343 --> 01:06:58,812
Has not my son said:

504
01:06:59,596 --> 01:07:04,318
"What man having 100 sheep,
if he lose one of them...

505
01:07:04,476 --> 01:07:07,650
...does not leave the 99
in the wilderness...

506
01:07:07,813 --> 01:07:10,987
...and go after that which is lost,
until he find it?

507
01:07:12,234 --> 01:07:17,324
And when he has found it,
he lays it upon his shoulders, rejoicing.

508
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:26,062
And when he comes home, he calls
his friends and neighbors together...

509
01:07:26,224 --> 01:07:28,397
...and sayeth unto them:

510
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:31,066
'Rejoice...

511
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:34,657
...for I have found the sheep...

512
01:07:35,775 --> 01:07:37,322
...which I lost.'"

513
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:42,899
You would not have sought out this house
if God had not wanted you to.

514
01:07:45,344 --> 01:07:46,846
Come.

515
01:07:47,221 --> 01:07:49,189
Share my table.

516
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:06,982
"Noble Pilate,
the day before the ides of April...

517
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:11,230
...the man Jesus left Jerusalem,
accompanied by five of his disciples:

518
01:08:11,388 --> 01:08:14,983
Peter, Andrew, John, Philip...

519
01:08:15,142 --> 01:08:17,816
...and Nathaniel.

520
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,734
Outside the walls of the city...

521
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,744
...they were joined by a sixth disciple...

522
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:31,354
...a man called Judas Iscariot.
They traveled north.

523
01:08:31,513 --> 01:08:33,511
The fourth day after the nones of May...

524
01:08:33,678 --> 01:08:37,558
...the man Jesus and his disciples
entered the town of Capernaum.

525
01:08:39,016 --> 01:08:42,816
There Jesus laid hands on a madman
and cast out the demon in him.

526
01:08:44,564 --> 01:08:48,364
The same evening, the man Jesus
brought a dying child back to health.

527
01:08:48,734 --> 01:08:51,203
Two miracles in one day."

528
01:08:51,362 --> 01:08:52,904
But, Lucius ....

529
01:08:54,227 --> 01:08:56,218
These things ....

530
01:08:57,427 --> 01:08:58,804
Can they really be true?

531
01:09:00,139 --> 01:09:02,233
I do not know, my lady.

532
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:04,644
I, myself, have never seen a miracle.

533
01:09:07,062 --> 01:09:09,190
There are no such things as miracles.

534
01:09:09,606 --> 01:09:12,735
Only fools who believe in them.
Continue.

535
01:09:12,901 --> 01:09:15,074
"The day after the nones of June...

536
01:09:15,237 --> 01:09:17,231
...at the crossroads...

537
01:09:17,397 --> 01:09:21,228
...a Roman tax collector
by name of Matthew saw Jesus pass...

538
01:09:21,386 --> 01:09:23,764
...and promptly left
his tax-collecting duties...

539
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,355
...and has joined up with the man Jesus
and become the seventh disciple.

540
01:09:28,476 --> 01:09:32,071
A harlot from Jerusalem
by the name of Magdalene...

541
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:34,358
...is also residing in the same house."

542
01:09:34,816 --> 01:09:37,069
Tax collectors and harlots.

543
01:09:37,735 --> 01:09:40,360
"The day before the nones of July...

544
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:45,637
...the man Jesus spoke to a crowd of over
5000 people at the foot of Mount Tabor...

545
01:09:45,803 --> 01:09:47,851
...near Lake Galilee.

546
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:50,391
It has been reported that
with a basket containing...

547
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:53,232
...two fish and five loaves of bread...

548
01:09:53,394 --> 01:09:56,773
...the man Jesus fed the entire multitude."

549
01:09:57,022 --> 01:09:59,901
I never heard such absolute nonsense.

550
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:07,064
"The day after the ides of July, Jesus was
seen to walk on the water of Lake Galilee."

551
01:10:09,469 --> 01:10:11,517
Ridiculous.

552
01:10:11,805 --> 01:10:16,777
"That evening a storm ravaged the lake,
threatening the lives of fishermen.

553
01:10:16,935 --> 01:10:19,108
The man Jesus raised his arm...

554
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:22,525
- Does our Lucius mock me?
- ...the wind died, the storm ceased."

555
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:31,059
So it is reported.

556
01:10:42,812 --> 01:10:47,238
Then Lucius,
thinking on Nazareth, the long years...

557
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,030
...the mother, the child,
and the miracles...

558
01:10:51,195 --> 01:10:53,653
...did go to see John the Baptist.

559
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,104
You have treated me well.

560
01:11:08,147 --> 01:11:11,367
I should like to ask
just one more kindness.

561
01:11:11,525 --> 01:11:13,027
Ask.

562
01:11:15,195 --> 01:11:17,359
Before I leave this world...

563
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,514
...I would send a message to Jesus.

564
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,313
What is the message?

565
01:11:25,557 --> 01:11:28,527
Ask of him, in these words:

566
01:11:31,396 --> 01:11:34,070
"Was it your coming that was foretold...

567
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,653
...or are we to expect another?"

568
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:42,392
You doubt him?

569
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:46,345
I do not doubt him.

570
01:11:47,638 --> 01:11:52,064
But I would like to hear it
from his own lips.

571
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:54,399
You are always looking at her.

572
01:12:56,218 --> 01:12:58,892
You are sick with jealousy.

573
01:13:17,063 --> 01:13:19,394
Dance for me, Salome!

574
01:13:25,557 --> 01:13:27,104
Salome.

575
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:29,728
Drink a little wine.

576
01:13:31,104 --> 01:13:32,731
Taste this...

577
01:13:33,022 --> 01:13:34,865
...so that I may drain the cup.

578
01:13:35,817 --> 01:13:37,319
I am not thirsty.

579
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:41,357
Come and sit next to me.

580
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:47,309
I will give you the throne of your mother.

581
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,313
You are not enough of a king.

582
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:54,979
You keep the man
who reviled my mother in a dungeon...

583
01:13:55,146 --> 01:13:57,365
...when he should have died months ago.

584
01:13:57,523 --> 01:13:59,366
Why do you let him live?

585
01:14:02,653 --> 01:14:05,112
I have had talks with him.

586
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:07,183
John is a very great prophet.

587
01:14:07,344 --> 01:14:10,346
He's a madman,
and you are afraid of him.

588
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,856
I am afraid of no man.

589
01:14:17,227 --> 01:14:21,198
Salome, dance for me.

590
01:14:21,898 --> 01:14:24,367
I command you to dance.

591
01:14:24,985 --> 01:14:26,737
I will not dance.

592
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:30,353
You cannot refuse me.

593
01:14:30,515 --> 01:14:33,182
Salome will now dance for us.

594
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,563
I do refuse.

595
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:41,687
Salome, I beg of you.
I will give you anything you want.

596
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:44,572
- Anything?
- Even unto the half of my kingdom.

597
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,738
Do you swear?

598
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:52,822
By my life, by my crown,
and before the governor of Judea.

599
01:14:55,054 --> 01:14:57,803
Whatever it is you want,
I will give it to you...

600
01:14:59,179 --> 01:15:01,853
...even if it is the throne of your mother.

601
01:15:05,477 --> 01:15:07,400
You have given your word.

602
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:13,819
I'm the slave of my word...

603
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:18,149
...and my word is the word of a king.

604
01:17:07,437 --> 01:17:08,563
Anything I want?

605
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:46,722
Now, Salome,
what would you have for your dance?

606
01:17:48,389 --> 01:17:50,107
I want...

607
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:51,734
...on a silver platter....

608
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:56,322
What on a silver platter?
A ruby? A diamond? A pearl?

609
01:17:58,899 --> 01:18:01,698
I want the head of John the Baptist.

610
01:18:09,094 --> 01:18:11,188
Have you gone mad?

611
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:19,237
What can you want
with the head of a man?

612
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,232
I want to look at it.

613
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:28,280
Salome, listen to me.

614
01:18:28,438 --> 01:18:30,646
I have jewels hidden in this palace...

615
01:18:30,804 --> 01:18:33,269
...jewels that thy mother even
has never seen.

616
01:18:33,427 --> 01:18:35,555
Jewels that are marvelous to look at.

617
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:37,223
Great topazes.

618
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:41,236
Opals that burn with a fire as cold as ice.

619
01:18:42,311 --> 01:18:45,030
Give me the head of John the Baptist...

620
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:48,068
...or let it be known to everyone here...

621
01:18:48,234 --> 01:18:50,407
...that the word of the king is worthless.

622
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:37,236
Give her what she asks.

623
01:19:56,564 --> 01:20:00,535
John the Baptist
has sent a message to ask me:

624
01:20:01,193 --> 01:20:06,929
"Is it your coming that was foretold,
or are we to expect another?"

625
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:10,972
My answer to John is your testimony.

626
01:20:11,513 --> 01:20:14,517
What you people here have witnessed.'

627
01:20:14,683 --> 01:20:17,061
How the blind see once more.

628
01:20:17,227 --> 01:20:18,979
How the lame walk.

629
01:20:19,146 --> 01:20:22,571
The lepers are made clean.
The deaf now hear.

630
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:25,948
I say to John,
"What was it you expected to see...

631
01:20:26,111 --> 01:20:28,400
...when you went out into the desert?"

632
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,471
Was it a reed trembling in the wind?

633
01:20:32,635 --> 01:20:35,559
No, that is not what you expected to see.

634
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,400
Was it a man, clad in fine garments?

635
01:20:40,059 --> 01:20:45,907
No. You must look in king's palaces for
proudly-dressed men who live in luxury.

636
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:49,489
Why, then, did he go out?

637
01:20:50,528 --> 01:20:52,566
To see a prophet?

638
01:20:54,222 --> 01:20:56,765
I say to John the Baptist:

639
01:20:57,511 --> 01:21:00,731
"Blessed is he who keeps his faith."

640
01:21:01,181 --> 01:21:03,809
And I further say to all of you:

641
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,939
"God has raised up
no greater son of woman...

642
01:21:08,647 --> 01:21:10,900
...than John the Baptist."

643
01:21:52,601 --> 01:21:57,357
All over Galilee, the disciples of Jesus are
calling for a gathering to hear him speak.

644
01:21:57,523 --> 01:22:01,073
This new prophet, Jesus,
he speaks like John the Baptist.

645
01:22:01,235 --> 01:22:03,199
How do we know it's not the same man?

646
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:06,222
Perhaps John has risen from the dead.

647
01:22:07,176 --> 01:22:09,018
Why did I do it?

648
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:12,223
I am not an evil man.

649
01:22:14,307 --> 01:22:15,354
Why did I do it?

650
01:22:15,517 --> 01:22:17,565
You should've done it
the day you imprisoned him.

651
01:22:17,727 --> 01:22:20,856
It is John the Baptist.
He has come back in the form of Jesus.

652
01:22:21,022 --> 01:22:22,865
Superstition. Tell him it is not true.

653
01:22:23,567 --> 01:22:26,446
I knew John the Baptist
and I have met Jesus.

654
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:28,602
They are not the same man.

655
01:22:28,768 --> 01:22:31,055
Stop him. Call your soldiers.

656
01:22:31,217 --> 01:22:32,309
Arrest him!

657
01:22:33,052 --> 01:22:36,181
And start a rebellion?
All Rome wants is peace and taxes.

658
01:22:36,347 --> 01:22:39,567
I don't intend to spend the rest of my life
in this miserable country.

659
01:22:39,725 --> 01:22:41,819
Where is this gathering
taking place, Lucius?

660
01:22:41,978 --> 01:22:43,980
A mount in the hills of Galilee.

661
01:22:46,566 --> 01:22:47,692
Have you any suggestion?

662
01:22:48,234 --> 01:22:50,531
Not until I hear what the man speaks.

663
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:54,602
Go to this meeting, Lucius.

664
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,432
Let the man talk. Listen to him.

665
01:22:57,594 --> 01:23:01,019
If he utters a single word
treasonable to Rome...

666
01:23:01,598 --> 01:23:02,690
...you'll have to act.

667
01:23:06,603 --> 01:23:09,823
I tell you,
it is John the Baptist rising again.

668
01:23:16,311 --> 01:23:19,471
And so much was the fame
that went abroad of Jesus...

669
01:23:19,634 --> 01:23:23,059
...that there was a gathering of people,
like flocks from the hills.

670
01:23:23,221 --> 01:23:26,225
Great multitudes came
out of all Judea and Jerusalem...

671
01:23:26,766 --> 01:23:29,269
...and from the sea coast
of Tyre and Sidon...

672
01:23:29,435 --> 01:23:32,905
...which came to hear him,
and to be healed.

673
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,816
My lady, it is not safe
for Pilate's wife to be here.

674
01:24:15,976 --> 01:24:18,104
I must hear this man.

675
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:20,943
Will you stay with me, Lucius?

676
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,973
They have all gathered,
and are awaiting your word.

677
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,819
Blessed are you who are poor...

678
01:26:19,062 --> 01:26:22,191
...for yours is the kingdom of heaven.

679
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:29,681
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

680
01:26:31,175 --> 01:26:35,055
Blessed are you who do
hunger and thirst after righteousness...

681
01:26:36,222 --> 01:26:38,224
...for you shall be filled.

682
01:26:39,267 --> 01:26:43,238
Blessed are those who are merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

683
01:26:44,772 --> 01:26:49,243
And blessed are those who are mourners,
for they shall be comforted.

684
01:26:50,234 --> 01:26:53,564
Blessed are those
who are pure in heart...

685
01:26:53,929 --> 01:26:56,222
...for they shall see God.

686
01:26:57,386 --> 01:27:00,515
And blessed are you
who are the peacemakers...

687
01:27:00,681 --> 01:27:03,685
...for you shall be called
the children of God.

688
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:10,195
And blessed are you who are persecuted
for righteousness' sake...

689
01:27:12,234 --> 01:27:15,356
...for yours is the kingdom of heaven.

690
01:27:20,051 --> 01:27:24,477
- Give us a sign from heaven!
- Prove to us who you are!

691
01:27:25,348 --> 01:27:28,397
Blessed are you
when men shall curse you...

692
01:27:28,935 --> 01:27:32,565
...and separate you from their company,
and reproach you...

693
01:27:33,273 --> 01:27:36,026
...and cast out your name as evil...

694
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:39,691
...for the Son of Man's sake.

695
01:27:39,853 --> 01:27:43,013
When?
When is the kingdom of God coming?

696
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:46,603
Watch as you may,
you will not see it come.

697
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,521
No one will say,
"Here it is," or, "There it is."

698
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,234
For the kingdom of God is within you.

699
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:57,194
Rabbi!

700
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:59,825
What must I do to inherit eternal life?

701
01:28:02,731 --> 01:28:04,724
What is written in the law:

702
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:09,558
To love the Lord, your God,
with all your heart...

703
01:28:09,886 --> 01:28:11,809
...with all your soul...

704
01:28:12,347 --> 01:28:15,317
...with all your power and all your mind.

705
01:28:16,643 --> 01:28:19,442
And love your neighbor
as you love yourself.

706
01:28:20,313 --> 01:28:22,407
Do that and you shall live eternally.

707
01:28:23,733 --> 01:28:26,608
I'm a camel driver.
Who can I call neighbor?

708
01:28:26,773 --> 01:28:29,978
He to whom you show mercy
and compassion...

709
01:28:30,137 --> 01:28:32,556
...whether you know him or not.

710
01:28:33,302 --> 01:28:35,680
Are you the Messiah?

711
01:28:36,973 --> 01:28:38,725
I am the good shepherd.

712
01:28:38,891 --> 01:28:41,565
The good shepherd lays down his life
for his sheep.

713
01:28:41,936 --> 01:28:44,735
Do you speak against
the law of the prophets?

714
01:28:44,897 --> 01:28:48,492
I come not to destroy
the law or the prophets...

715
01:28:49,193 --> 01:28:51,154
...but to fulfill them.

716
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:55,134
For I say unto you:

717
01:28:55,759 --> 01:28:59,855
Love your enemies,
bless them who curse you...

718
01:29:00,556 --> 01:29:05,483
...and pray for those
who despise and persecute you.

719
01:29:05,894 --> 01:29:08,864
For if you love only those
who love you...

720
01:29:09,898 --> 01:29:11,696
...what reward shall you have?

721
01:29:12,317 --> 01:29:14,565
If you are a holy man...

722
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:18,514
...why do you eat and drink
with sinners and tax collectors?

723
01:29:19,759 --> 01:29:23,559
The healthy have no need of a physician,
but the sick do.

724
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:27,146
I come not to call the righteous,
but sinners, to repentance.

725
01:29:27,308 --> 01:29:28,810
I am a tax collector.

726
01:29:28,977 --> 01:29:32,026
I worship in the Temple every day,
yet they hate and despise me.

727
01:29:32,188 --> 01:29:33,690
What can I do?

728
01:29:34,691 --> 01:29:37,160
No man can serve two masters.

729
01:29:37,318 --> 01:29:39,935
Either he will hate the one
and love the other...

730
01:29:40,101 --> 01:29:42,389
...or he will cling to the one
and despise the other.

731
01:29:42,551 --> 01:29:45,474
You cannot serve God and Mammon.

732
01:29:45,886 --> 01:29:47,684
And I say unto you:

733
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:52,192
Be not anxious for your life...

734
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:54,899
...for the food you eat...

735
01:29:55,396 --> 01:29:59,242
...or for your body
or the clothes you wear...

736
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:03,403
...for is not life greater than food?

737
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:05,895
And your bodies more than the clothing?

738
01:30:09,761 --> 01:30:12,480
Behold the birds of the sky.

739
01:30:14,683 --> 01:30:19,439
They neither sow nor reap,
nor take their harvest to the barns.

740
01:30:19,604 --> 01:30:22,528
And yet God feeds them.

741
01:30:23,775 --> 01:30:26,693
And how much more are you than they?

742
01:30:28,226 --> 01:30:31,388
Consider the lilies of the field
and how they grow.

743
01:30:32,426 --> 01:30:35,054
They toil not, neither do they spin.

744
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:39,981
And can any one of you, by worrying...

745
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:43,397
...add a moment to your years?

746
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,396
My wife and I believe in you,
but we are poor.

747
01:30:51,561 --> 01:30:55,643
We have nothing to give.
How can we show you our faith?

748
01:30:58,762 --> 01:31:01,311
You have, by what you have said.

749
01:31:04,101 --> 01:31:09,574
Come to me,
all of you who labor and are heavy-laden...

750
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:11,900
...and I will refresh you.

751
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:14,398
Rabbi.

752
01:31:14,896 --> 01:31:18,431
Rabbi, I believe you're the Messiah.
How can I serve you?

753
01:31:18,592 --> 01:31:23,062
The Son of Man comes to serve,
not to be served.

754
01:31:23,638 --> 01:31:28,735
Whoever among you who would be great
must be a servant.

755
01:31:29,352 --> 01:31:34,199
And whoever will be first
must be the slave of all.

756
01:31:35,483 --> 01:31:38,526
We have heard the voices
of false messiahs before.

757
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:41,516
How do we know
you are not sent by Satan?

758
01:31:42,675 --> 01:31:48,023
If a kingdom is divided against itself,
the kingdom cannot stand.

759
01:31:48,556 --> 01:31:53,312
If Satan also be divided against himself,
how then can his kingdom stand?

760
01:31:53,644 --> 01:31:56,693
How can Satan cast out Satan?

761
01:32:02,979 --> 01:32:07,469
I see before me flesh and blood.
You are only a man.

762
01:32:07,634 --> 01:32:10,057
Why do you make yourself
out to be the Son of God?

763
01:32:12,139 --> 01:32:16,235
If I am not doing the deeds of my father,
do not believe me.

764
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:21,114
But if I am doing them
and you will still not believe in me...

765
01:32:21,731 --> 01:32:23,733
...believe in the work I do.

766
01:32:25,692 --> 01:32:28,230
If you can do miracles,
call upon God to send hosts...

767
01:32:28,391 --> 01:32:31,305
...to destroy the Romans
and free our people from bondage.

768
01:32:31,467 --> 01:32:34,471
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God.

769
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:37,357
The Romans are conquerors.

770
01:32:38,057 --> 01:32:41,561
To conquer them would make you
no different than they.

771
01:32:41,811 --> 01:32:44,815
Rabbi, what is faith?

772
01:32:44,981 --> 01:32:50,527
If you have faith that is no greater
than this grain of mustard seed...

773
01:32:51,768 --> 01:32:55,100
...and you say to the mountain,
"You shall move"...

774
01:32:56,218 --> 01:32:58,641
...the mountain will move.

775
01:32:58,804 --> 01:33:01,227
Nothing is impossible.

776
01:33:01,765 --> 01:33:03,688
How judge a transgressor?

777
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:07,733
Judge not, lest you be judged.

778
01:33:07,896 --> 01:33:11,651
For you will be judged by the standards
you yourself shall apply.

779
01:33:14,065 --> 01:33:16,897
Why do you note the speck
in your brother's eye...

780
01:33:17,719 --> 01:33:21,015
...and take no notice
of the beam in your own eye?

781
01:33:22,971 --> 01:33:27,477
You hypocrites,
first remove the beam from your own eye...

782
01:33:27,642 --> 01:33:33,240
...and then you will see clearly enough
to remove the speck from your brother's.

783
01:33:36,651 --> 01:33:39,394
Give not that which is holy to dogs.

784
01:33:40,473 --> 01:33:45,561
Neither cast your pearls before swine,
lest they trample them under their feet...

785
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:48,598
...and then turn and tear you to pieces.

786
01:33:53,352 --> 01:33:57,198
Ask, and you shall receive.

787
01:33:58,065 --> 01:34:00,238
Seek, and you shall find.

788
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:03,813
Knock, and the door
shall be opened unto you.

789
01:34:06,384 --> 01:34:10,229
For everyone who asks, receives.

790
01:34:10,971 --> 01:34:13,349
And every seeker finds.

791
01:34:13,849 --> 01:34:18,275
And to all those who knock,
the door is opened.

792
01:34:19,813 --> 01:34:22,441
Is there a man among you...

793
01:34:22,941 --> 01:34:26,564
...who would hand his son a stone
if he asked for bread?

794
01:34:26,978 --> 01:34:29,561
Or a serpent if he asked for fish?

795
01:34:31,801 --> 01:34:35,351
If, then, you who are evil...

796
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:39,150
...know how to give your children
what is good...

797
01:34:39,308 --> 01:34:41,527
...think how much more
your heavenly father...

798
01:34:41,686 --> 01:34:44,860
...will give good things
to those who ask him?

799
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:50,072
Therefore, treat your fellow man
as you would have him treat you.

800
01:34:52,016 --> 01:34:56,511
For this is the law of the prophets.

801
01:35:08,272 --> 01:35:10,400
Teach us to pray.

802
01:35:35,066 --> 01:35:39,605
Our father, who art in heaven...

803
01:35:40,681 --> 01:35:43,051
...hallowed be thy name.

804
01:35:45,094 --> 01:35:47,096
Thy kingdom come.

805
01:35:48,389 --> 01:35:51,484
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

806
01:35:52,393 --> 01:35:57,741
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses...

807
01:35:58,482 --> 01:36:01,856
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

808
01:36:02,728 --> 01:36:07,434
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

809
01:36:10,887 --> 01:36:15,233
For thine is the kingdom...

810
01:36:16,476 --> 01:36:20,731
...and the power, and the glory...

811
01:36:21,565 --> 01:36:23,488
...for ever and ever.

812
01:36:25,565 --> 01:36:27,401
Amen.

813
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:10,107
Words.

814
01:37:13,024 --> 01:37:15,064
The Rabbi is calling you.

815
01:37:22,637 --> 01:37:25,891
Your friend is one of those
who did not understand.

816
01:37:58,190 --> 01:37:59,567
What did the man say?

817
01:38:01,938 --> 01:38:05,553
He spoke of peace...

818
01:38:06,716 --> 01:38:08,093
...love...

819
01:38:09,177 --> 01:38:10,679
...and the brotherhood of man.

820
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:13,898
Is that all?

821
01:38:15,725 --> 01:38:17,318
That is all.

822
01:38:27,184 --> 01:38:28,725
What is the matter?

823
01:38:29,677 --> 01:38:31,722
The look on Lucius' face.

824
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:35,684
He had a long journey. He looked tired.

825
01:38:36,389 --> 01:38:39,017
He looked more than tired to my eyes.

826
01:38:44,981 --> 01:38:46,574
Good night, Caiaphas.

827
01:38:46,732 --> 01:38:49,402
- Do you believe in him?
- I do.

828
01:38:49,564 --> 01:38:51,558
Self-appointed saviors like your Jesus...

829
01:38:51,724 --> 01:38:54,092
...might stir the people up
against the Romans.

830
01:38:54,258 --> 01:38:58,013
- But he is a good man.
- You are a fool, Nicodemus.

831
01:38:58,428 --> 01:39:00,396
Good or bad, he's a threat.

832
01:39:00,556 --> 01:39:03,526
If Pilate could use Jesus and his followers
as an excuse...

833
01:39:03,684 --> 01:39:06,028
...he would massacre our people.

834
01:39:06,186 --> 01:39:08,359
What do you intend to do, Caiaphas?

835
01:39:08,522 --> 01:39:12,571
For the present, we will bide our time.

836
01:39:19,008 --> 01:39:22,854
And then Jesus called
unto him his disciples, the chosen 12...

837
01:39:23,012 --> 01:39:24,855
...whom he also named apostles...

838
01:39:25,014 --> 01:39:27,016
...and led them into the wilderness.

839
01:39:28,893 --> 01:39:32,238
And these were Simon, called Peter,
and Andrew...

840
01:39:32,397 --> 01:39:34,695
...James and John,
the sons of Zebedee...

841
01:39:34,858 --> 01:39:37,572
...Philip and Bartholomew,
Matthew and Thomas.

842
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:39,894
And James, the son of Alphaeus.

843
01:39:40,056 --> 01:39:43,392
Thaddaeus, Simon the Canaanite.

844
01:39:43,717 --> 01:39:47,597
And among them, Judas Iscariot.

845
01:39:51,559 --> 01:39:54,403
Now, none of these chosen
were most learned.

846
01:39:54,562 --> 01:39:58,157
None was a teacher of great truths.
None was rich and powerful.

847
01:39:58,315 --> 01:40:02,063
They but knew the waters of Galilee,
the shores and the fields beyond.

848
01:40:02,228 --> 01:40:05,560
But knowing this,
they were most rare, simple and precious.

849
01:40:05,717 --> 01:40:09,845
For they were the pure in heart
and but needed instruction.

850
01:40:14,057 --> 01:40:17,061
For Jesus saw his own disciples
doubt him.

851
01:40:17,227 --> 01:40:19,605
Awed by his miracles, faithful to him.

852
01:40:19,771 --> 01:40:21,899
Yet still they wondered
why the Messiah...

853
01:40:22,065 --> 01:40:25,609
...could not raise up miraculous armies
to strike Judea free.

854
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:30,429
Could simple love and brotherhood
be weapons against Rome?

855
01:40:33,928 --> 01:40:36,602
For the disciples, like the multitudes...

856
01:40:36,764 --> 01:40:39,563
...were troubled
by the Sermon on the Mount.

857
01:40:39,725 --> 01:40:42,729
They had come seeking
earthquakes and whirlwinds...

858
01:40:42,895 --> 01:40:45,523
...the word of Jesus
to smite the heavens...

859
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:48,442
...and drop fiery swords
in their upraised hands...

860
01:40:48,607 --> 01:40:51,566
...drown Caesar's Chariots in the sea.

861
01:40:52,014 --> 01:40:54,224
This, then, was Jesus' task:

862
01:40:54,383 --> 01:40:57,353
To keep his disciples
from the doubting cities.

863
01:40:57,511 --> 01:41:01,561
And to give them fresh wisdom wherewith
to cleanse themselves, as with water.

864
01:41:01,723 --> 01:41:03,646
To make them men of God.

865
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:07,229
Peace and love he taught them,
in many tongues.

866
01:41:07,396 --> 01:41:10,821
And the days passed,
and the time of teaching was at an end.

867
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:15,063
And those we help,
how shall they reward us?

868
01:41:15,516 --> 01:41:19,055
You receive without payment,
give without payment.

869
01:41:19,217 --> 01:41:23,563
And take neither gold, nor silver,
nor copper under your belts.

870
01:41:24,389 --> 01:41:25,891
Nor staffs.

871
01:41:26,349 --> 01:41:29,273
You send us out sheep among wolves.

872
01:41:30,436 --> 01:41:32,814
Then be as wise as the serpent...

873
01:41:32,981 --> 01:41:35,404
...and as harmless as the dove.

874
01:41:35,859 --> 01:41:41,061
And at the appointed time,
I will join you in Jerusalem.

875
01:41:42,174 --> 01:41:45,599
And he blessed them and
sent them two by two before his face...

876
01:41:45,761 --> 01:41:49,857
...into every city and place to heal the sick,
to preach the kingdom of God...

877
01:41:50,015 --> 01:41:52,734
...and to have authority over evil.

878
01:42:01,604 --> 01:42:05,060
Yes, there is rust.
And the water is too warm.

879
01:42:05,385 --> 01:42:08,556
Someone is forging weapons.

880
01:42:09,386 --> 01:42:12,435
Blacksmiths are only licensed
to operate in the western end of the city.

881
01:42:12,597 --> 01:42:16,693
These waters come from
the underground cellar in the eastern end.

882
01:42:16,852 --> 01:42:18,900
Can you locate this cellar?

883
01:42:19,062 --> 01:42:21,360
The eastern end
is honeycombed with cellars.

884
01:42:21,523 --> 01:42:23,025
Some we could never find.

885
01:42:25,936 --> 01:42:27,399
You should not have killed this man.

886
01:42:27,557 --> 01:42:29,517
You should have saved him
for questioning.

887
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:21,603
Go on.
Make more weapons to kill more people.

888
01:43:21,761 --> 01:43:23,104
That is what I intend.

889
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:26,267
But while the metal cools, think.

890
01:43:26,432 --> 01:43:30,278
- You saw Jesus, you heard him speak.
- He speaks only of peace!

891
01:43:30,436 --> 01:43:35,567
I am fire. He is water.
How can we ever meet?

892
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:41,552
The day after the next Sabbath,
Jesus comes here to join his disciples.

893
01:43:41,842 --> 01:43:44,811
- Here, in Jerusalem?
- In Jerusalem.

894
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,018
To preach at the greatest temple
in all the land!

895
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:51,525
Such crowds will gather
that the Romans will not dare touch him.

896
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:54,236
Then, Barabbas, then is the time.

897
01:43:54,395 --> 01:43:58,400
Move your men to stand by Jesus,
but keep their swords sheathed.

898
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:01,064
Let your strength be known, but silent.

899
01:44:01,562 --> 01:44:03,398
Let Jesus speak.

900
01:44:03,557 --> 01:44:06,426
And when his message of peace
sweeps the city...

901
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,270
...let the people proclaim him
king of Judea.

902
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,682
How can he refuse?

903
01:44:20,188 --> 01:44:23,158
If he can free the Jews
without spilling blood...

904
01:44:23,733 --> 01:44:25,727
...he deserves the crown.

905
01:44:27,057 --> 01:44:31,392
I'll shape the crown myself,
and place it on his brow.

906
01:44:39,684 --> 01:44:42,312
You will stand beside him
in the temple, then?

907
01:44:43,729 --> 01:44:45,276
You will give him time to speak?

908
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,864
Yes.

909
01:44:56,301 --> 01:44:59,020
That will be a day to be remembered.

910
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:05,857
It will be remembered.

911
01:45:06,019 --> 01:45:08,442
- Barabbas!
- Shh.

912
01:45:10,107 --> 01:45:11,858
Judas dreams.

913
01:45:12,565 --> 01:45:17,098
And all dreamers are fools.
This is the hour that we have waited for.

914
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:18,554
Yes.

915
01:45:18,716 --> 01:45:23,062
Jesus comes to the Temple. Let him.
He brings us our audience.

916
01:45:23,972 --> 01:45:25,724
We'll borrow them.

917
01:45:26,307 --> 01:45:29,402
We'll run them through the streets
to the fortress.

918
01:45:29,561 --> 01:45:30,608
This way, and that.

919
01:45:31,062 --> 01:45:33,531
- Your people, Seth, will storm the gates.
- Yes.

920
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:36,237
- Yours, Enoch, will breach the north wall.
- Right.

921
01:45:36,398 --> 01:45:38,642
I, myself, will scale the wall
to the south.

922
01:45:38,808 --> 01:45:42,346
Quickly done and over,
we will lend the crowd back to Jesus.

923
01:45:44,385 --> 01:45:47,389
- Is that fair or not?
- Yes, fair.

924
01:50:38,099 --> 01:50:40,227
No one but Barabbas
would attempt such a thing.

925
01:50:41,394 --> 01:50:44,318
You speak of Barabbas with respect?

926
01:50:45,565 --> 01:50:47,611
I always respect the enemy.

927
01:50:47,772 --> 01:50:50,890
Men like Lucius
keep our empire together.

928
01:50:51,388 --> 01:50:54,429
Your tour of duty in Jerusalem
ended years ago, Lucius.

929
01:50:55,634 --> 01:50:57,932
- Why do you stay here?
- Where else would I go?

930
01:50:58,095 --> 01:51:00,644
Ah, but Rome is brilliant.

931
01:51:00,973 --> 01:51:04,068
I seem to have a talent
for surviving small wars.

932
01:51:04,226 --> 01:51:07,275
Politics and brilliant society
would destroy me.

933
01:51:07,437 --> 01:51:10,065
Personally, I suspect you found
our Roman gods too cruel.

934
01:51:10,983 --> 01:51:14,724
Are you also awaiting the coming
of the local Messiah?

935
01:51:18,424 --> 01:51:21,223
To believe in the Messiah,
one must believe in God.

936
01:51:22,387 --> 01:51:26,688
What I've witnessed in my years on earth
is proof enough to me there can be no God.

937
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:28,897
How many followers has he?

938
01:51:29,394 --> 01:51:31,613
Who? God? Jesus? Or Barabbas?

939
01:51:32,814 --> 01:51:34,031
Barabbas.

940
01:51:36,853 --> 01:51:39,846
How many dissatisfied Jews
are there in Jerusalem?

941
01:51:40,011 --> 01:51:43,350
Have you considered the possibility
of Jesus' and Barabbas' followers...

942
01:51:43,509 --> 01:51:44,635
...joining forces?

943
01:51:44,802 --> 01:51:46,554
I have.

944
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,472
Where would it happen?

945
01:51:50,015 --> 01:51:53,235
Since we are here, here.

946
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:07,510
And for many months
Jesus preached through Judea...

947
01:52:07,676 --> 01:52:10,179
...and angered the scribes
and the Pharisees...

948
01:52:10,345 --> 01:52:13,940
...who thought how they might kill him,
and numbered his days.

949
01:52:14,099 --> 01:52:15,942
And knowing the sum thereof..

950
01:52:16,101 --> 01:52:19,401
...Jesus came to spend time
with his mother.

951
01:52:50,224 --> 01:52:51,720
Blessings on this house.

952
01:52:51,886 --> 01:52:55,009
Welcome, Peter, John.

953
01:52:55,926 --> 01:53:00,181
We have done all you asked.
It is time we leave for Jerusalem.

954
01:53:02,558 --> 01:53:05,061
The chair will have to wait until I return.

955
01:53:05,227 --> 01:53:07,070
The chair will never be mended.

956
01:53:22,929 --> 01:53:24,897
I am going with you.

957
01:53:28,184 --> 01:53:30,312
Now the Jewish Passover was near...

958
01:53:30,478 --> 01:53:33,106
...and many went up from the country
to Jerusalem...

959
01:53:33,273 --> 01:53:36,192
...to purify themselves
and make holiday.

960
01:53:42,925 --> 01:53:44,518
He's coming.

961
01:53:47,138 --> 01:53:50,438
And Jesus, come from Bethany
and the Mount of Olives...

962
01:53:50,599 --> 01:53:54,570
...did enter Jerusalem on that day
to preach in the Temple...

963
01:53:54,728 --> 01:53:57,231
...for the Temple was Judea.

964
01:53:57,815 --> 01:54:00,029
His words, spoken here...

965
01:54:00,186 --> 01:54:03,225
...would echo in Tiberias,
Samaria and Caesarea.

966
01:54:03,387 --> 01:54:07,055
From here he might speak to the world,
if the world might listen...

967
01:54:07,717 --> 01:54:09,936
...and the waves be still.

968
01:54:21,606 --> 01:54:25,271
As the city prepared
for the Passover killing of the lamb...

969
01:54:25,433 --> 01:54:29,390
...the men of Barabbas
planned stranger celebrations...

970
01:54:29,549 --> 01:54:32,769
...made ready more terrible sacrifices.

971
01:55:38,347 --> 01:55:40,059
And Jesus went into the Temple.

972
01:55:40,218 --> 01:55:42,888
And the great doors
shut up one multitude...

973
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:45,018
...and within was peace...

974
01:55:46,929 --> 01:55:50,103
...while outside
was the sea that would not be stilled.

975
01:55:50,266 --> 01:55:53,440
The tongue which spoke not peace,
but the sword.

976
01:55:56,188 --> 01:55:57,906
Long live Judea!

977
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:26,805
Judea!

978
01:56:27,387 --> 01:56:28,725
Come.

979
01:56:57,886 --> 01:56:59,229
Get back!

980
01:57:04,393 --> 01:57:05,690
Now!

981
01:57:12,725 --> 01:57:14,098
Come on!

982
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:21,682
Help me.

983
02:01:30,145 --> 02:01:32,193
We will never rise again.

984
02:01:33,106 --> 02:01:35,727
The glory of Judea is dead.

985
02:01:35,893 --> 02:01:39,056
The Romans were waiting for us.
We had no chance.

986
02:01:39,219 --> 02:01:41,056
So many of us dead, for nothing.

987
02:01:41,423 --> 02:01:43,471
We must escape into the desert
and hide.

988
02:01:45,219 --> 02:01:50,146
It was you who told Barabbas that
the new Rabbi would show us the way.

989
02:01:50,307 --> 02:01:52,730
He does nothing but pray in the Temple.

990
02:01:53,978 --> 02:01:55,195
The Rabbi will help us.

991
02:01:55,729 --> 02:01:58,230
Huh. How will he help us?

992
02:02:00,433 --> 02:02:02,179
He has the power of miracles.

993
02:02:02,346 --> 02:02:04,965
He will not use his power,
except to heal the sick.

994
02:02:05,132 --> 02:02:09,182
He can call down hosts
to destroy the fortress of Pilate.

995
02:02:09,344 --> 02:02:11,096
He preaches against violence.

996
02:02:11,263 --> 02:02:16,064
He can, with a look, rock the foundations
of Herod Antipas' palace...

997
02:02:16,226 --> 02:02:18,695
...and bring the Walls down
on the tyrant's head.

998
02:02:19,563 --> 02:02:22,859
He has never done these things before.
Why will he change now?

999
02:02:24,475 --> 02:02:26,312
I will force his hand.

1000
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:28,058
Not with us!

1001
02:02:30,508 --> 02:02:33,102
I will force his hand.

1002
02:02:36,556 --> 02:02:40,106
Once he feels
the Roman sword at his throat...

1003
02:02:41,018 --> 02:02:45,739
...he will strike them down
with the wave of one arm.

1004
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,724
Now came the days of unleavened bread.

1005
02:02:57,886 --> 02:02:58,978
And Jesus...

1006
02:02:59,138 --> 02:03:01,391
...knowing these to be
his final hours on earth...

1007
02:03:02,057 --> 02:03:05,061
...did send to prepare a Passover feast.

1008
02:03:05,310 --> 02:03:09,689
And there, a last time,
stood with and among his disciples.

1009
02:03:10,521 --> 02:03:14,104
And gathered them in, all 12.

1010
02:03:38,636 --> 02:03:43,226
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God,
king of the universe...

1011
02:03:44,385 --> 02:03:47,229
...who bids us eat bitter herbs.

1012
02:03:56,397 --> 02:03:59,235
Tonight, one among you will betray me.

1013
02:04:04,674 --> 02:04:06,471
What you must do, do quickly.

1014
02:04:35,221 --> 02:04:38,065
I will be with you for only a short time.

1015
02:04:38,224 --> 02:04:40,067
Where are you going?

1016
02:04:40,393 --> 02:04:43,738
Where I go, you cannot go,
but you will follow me afterwards.

1017
02:04:43,896 --> 02:04:45,862
We'll follow you to the ends of the earth.

1018
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:48,935
Tonight you will all lose courage
and desert me.

1019
02:04:49,098 --> 02:04:50,595
Impossible.

1020
02:04:51,301 --> 02:04:52,843
I would not desert you.

1021
02:04:53,006 --> 02:04:55,225
I would go to prison.
I would die for you first.

1022
02:04:55,759 --> 02:04:59,184
Believe me, Peter, this night,
before the cock crows twice...

1023
02:04:59,346 --> 02:05:01,223
...you will deny knowing me three times.

1024
02:05:03,267 --> 02:05:05,770
- Never!
- No. Impossible!

1025
02:05:05,936 --> 02:05:07,404
We'd never desert you.

1026
02:05:08,230 --> 02:05:09,821
Never.

1027
02:05:11,309 --> 02:05:13,022
My last wish...

1028
02:05:15,343 --> 02:05:18,512
...is that you love one another
as I have loved you.

1029
02:05:19,425 --> 02:05:23,680
The greatest gift a man can give
is to lay down his life for his friends.

1030
02:05:24,722 --> 02:05:27,350
And when I am gone,
you will be grieved.

1031
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,654
But your grief will turn into joy.

1032
02:05:32,063 --> 02:05:34,188
A woman in childbirth feels pain.

1033
02:05:34,353 --> 02:05:38,096
But when her child is born,
she does not remember the pain.

1034
02:05:39,176 --> 02:05:41,390
For a child has been born into the world.

1035
02:05:43,551 --> 02:05:47,181
And one day I will see you again,
and when I do...

1036
02:05:48,389 --> 02:05:50,733
...your joy will be such...

1037
02:05:51,892 --> 02:05:54,395
...that no one can take it from you.

1038
02:05:56,689 --> 02:05:58,812
For you have the faith.

1039
02:06:01,139 --> 02:06:05,383
And you believe in me and in him,
from whom I was sent.

1040
02:06:17,227 --> 02:06:21,277
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God,
king of the universe...

1041
02:06:22,561 --> 02:06:25,725
...who brings forth bread from the earth.

1042
02:06:37,682 --> 02:06:39,059
Take.

1043
02:06:56,885 --> 02:06:58,387
Eat.

1044
02:07:04,768 --> 02:07:06,236
For this is my body.

1045
02:07:16,091 --> 02:07:18,308
Do this in remembrance of me.

1046
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:44,185
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God...

1047
02:07:45,302 --> 02:07:47,350
...king of the universe...

1048
02:07:48,389 --> 02:07:50,812
...who creates the fruit of the vine.

1049
02:07:56,355 --> 02:07:57,899
Drink.

1050
02:07:58,061 --> 02:08:02,020
For this is my blood of the covenant,
which is shed for you...

1051
02:08:04,133 --> 02:08:05,724
...and for many...

1052
02:08:07,008 --> 02:08:08,385
...for the remission of sins.

1053
02:09:04,434 --> 02:09:07,278
- I wish to see the High Priest Caiaphas.
- It is late.

1054
02:09:07,437 --> 02:09:08,484
He will see me.

1055
02:09:08,647 --> 02:09:10,565
So Judas Iscariot went his way...

1056
02:09:10,726 --> 02:09:14,061
...to betray Jesus
to the chief priests and the captains...

1057
02:09:14,219 --> 02:09:16,341
...to say how Jesus and Barabbas...

1058
02:09:16,506 --> 02:09:19,601
...were the left and the right hands
of the same body.

1059
02:09:19,759 --> 02:09:22,228
Thus Judas thought
to test and prove forever...

1060
02:09:22,387 --> 02:09:25,231
...the divine power of the Messiah.

1061
02:09:27,392 --> 02:09:29,986
Then Jesus went forth
to the Mount of Olives...

1062
02:09:30,145 --> 02:09:32,898
...and the garden called Gethsemane...

1063
02:09:33,063 --> 02:09:35,774
...there to await the dark night ahead...

1064
02:09:35,932 --> 02:09:39,052
...there to consider
the dark days to follow...

1065
02:09:39,217 --> 02:09:43,013
...there to prepare for his trial
and his death.

1066
02:10:17,644 --> 02:10:19,191
Keep watch and pray.

1067
02:10:21,105 --> 02:10:22,772
Why must we wait?

1068
02:10:26,094 --> 02:10:27,762
What can I say?

1069
02:10:28,464 --> 02:10:30,933
"Father, save me from this hour?"

1070
02:10:32,885 --> 02:10:35,980
It is for this very reason
that I am coming to this hour.

1071
02:11:17,006 --> 02:11:18,883
My father.

1072
02:11:39,008 --> 02:11:40,722
My father.

1073
02:11:43,092 --> 02:11:45,811
All things are possible to you.

1074
02:11:49,598 --> 02:11:52,397
Take away this cup from me.

1075
02:12:35,555 --> 02:12:37,023
And yet...

1076
02:12:40,893 --> 02:12:43,112
...not as I will...

1077
02:12:48,721 --> 02:12:50,558
...but as you will.

1078
02:14:19,396 --> 02:14:20,941
You were with the man Jesus.

1079
02:14:21,394 --> 02:14:25,932
You are wrong, woman.
I-- I do not know the man Jesus.

1080
02:14:55,175 --> 02:14:57,223
Are you one of the disciples?

1081
02:14:58,345 --> 02:14:59,972
No, I am not.

1082
02:15:03,934 --> 02:15:07,313
- How long will Jesus be in there?
- I don't know.

1083
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:15,432
You're a disciple.
I saw you in the olive grove.

1084
02:15:15,590 --> 02:15:19,058
No, I am not. I was not in the olive grove.

1085
02:15:40,589 --> 02:15:42,341
I could swear you were with this man.

1086
02:15:47,054 --> 02:15:48,897
I do not know
what you are talking about.

1087
02:15:50,015 --> 02:15:52,564
I am not a follower of this man.

1088
02:16:54,675 --> 02:16:56,894
You have just been interrogated
by Caiaphas.

1089
02:16:57,052 --> 02:17:00,352
Blasphemy and Sedition.

1090
02:17:00,514 --> 02:17:03,017
This court takes no cognizance
of your blasphemy.

1091
02:17:03,183 --> 02:17:05,686
But the charge of Sedition
is a major offense.

1092
02:17:06,061 --> 02:17:08,403
The rules of Roman law will prevail.

1093
02:17:08,562 --> 02:17:10,558
I, Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea...

1094
02:17:10,724 --> 02:17:14,388
...by grace of Emperor Tiberius of Rome,
will judge your case.

1095
02:17:14,716 --> 02:17:16,885
No matter what you've done
up to this moment...

1096
02:17:17,048 --> 02:17:20,894
...no matter what others accuse you of,
I, and I alone, have the authority...

1097
02:17:21,052 --> 02:17:23,771
...to sentence you
to be crucified or flogged...

1098
02:17:23,930 --> 02:17:25,056
...or to set you free.

1099
02:17:25,723 --> 02:17:28,397
How you conduct yourself here and now
will determine your fate.

1100
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:30,278
Do you understand?

1101
02:17:35,057 --> 02:17:38,267
I am offering you an opportunity
to state your defense.

1102
02:17:44,552 --> 02:17:47,772
Silence can only serve
to militate against you.

1103
02:17:48,556 --> 02:17:50,558
I'm now offering you
a second opportunity.

1104
02:17:56,936 --> 02:17:59,976
In view of the continued
and obstinate silence of the accused...

1105
02:18:00,138 --> 02:18:03,009
...the court appoints Lucius Catanus
advocate of the defense.

1106
02:18:03,173 --> 02:18:07,392
I wish it emphasized in the record that
the accused is not without representation.

1107
02:18:20,228 --> 02:18:24,188
I cannot undertake your defense
unless you are willing to confide in me.

1108
02:18:25,094 --> 02:18:27,806
Does the accused
desire to confer with his advocate?

1109
02:18:36,639 --> 02:18:37,891
The trial will proceed.

1110
02:18:41,394 --> 02:18:43,522
For the benefit of the accused...

1111
02:18:44,893 --> 02:18:48,058
...so that he comprehends
the gravity of his case...

1112
02:18:48,554 --> 02:18:51,220
...I request the charge against him
be repeated.

1113
02:18:53,298 --> 02:18:56,768
The defendant is accused of claiming
to be the leader sent by their god...

1114
02:18:56,927 --> 02:18:59,601
...to liberate the Hebrew nation.

1115
02:19:09,851 --> 02:19:11,722
The accused, by neither deed nor word...

1116
02:19:11,888 --> 02:19:14,883
...has ever challenged
the jurisdiction of Rome.

1117
02:19:15,049 --> 02:19:16,423
During the past three years...

1118
02:19:16,589 --> 02:19:19,308
...the accused has by repeated
acts and speeches...

1119
02:19:20,051 --> 02:19:21,553
...disturbed the people...

1120
02:19:21,719 --> 02:19:25,769
...condemned the payment of tribute,
and claimed himself king.

1121
02:19:26,516 --> 02:19:29,065
And spread the word that his kingdom...

1122
02:19:29,227 --> 02:19:31,696
...has precedence over and above
Roman jurisdiction.

1123
02:19:31,854 --> 02:19:34,270
The defendant has only spoken
of the kingdom of God.

1124
02:19:34,432 --> 02:19:37,518
He's never attempted to usurp
Roman jurisdiction over Judea.

1125
02:19:38,009 --> 02:19:41,803
The implication is the same. There can be
no division of authority in Judea.

1126
02:19:42,216 --> 02:19:44,059
A nation can have only one master.

1127
02:19:44,218 --> 02:19:45,595
I repeat, my lord.

1128
02:19:45,761 --> 02:19:47,934
The defendant's claim
to a divine mission on earth...

1129
02:19:48,097 --> 02:19:50,725
...does not challenge
the authority of Rome.

1130
02:19:51,225 --> 02:19:55,401
Also, the performance of miracles
is beyond the jurisdiction of this court.

1131
02:19:56,852 --> 02:19:59,972
The accused does not stand trial
for the performance of miracles...

1132
02:20:00,138 --> 02:20:01,680
...but for setting up a kingdom.

1133
02:20:01,843 --> 02:20:05,512
Advocate for the defense
will confine his argument to the issue.

1134
02:20:08,301 --> 02:20:10,554
The charge is a secular issue.

1135
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:13,064
By treaty with Judea,
Rome has obligated itself...

1136
02:20:13,223 --> 02:20:15,567
...not to interfere in religious matters.

1137
02:20:15,725 --> 02:20:17,693
The court is fully aware of this evidence.

1138
02:20:17,853 --> 02:20:20,229
The court is also aware
of the unlawful assembly...

1139
02:20:20,394 --> 02:20:22,890
...the accused created
with his Sermon on the Mount.

1140
02:20:23,056 --> 02:20:24,644
I was present at that sermon.

1141
02:20:24,803 --> 02:20:27,423
I've submitted to the court
a report of his statements.

1142
02:20:27,589 --> 02:20:31,718
Not once did he speak a word
that would incite violence.

1143
02:20:31,884 --> 02:20:34,888
On the contrary, he spoke only of peace.

1144
02:20:35,847 --> 02:20:38,396
The court has also read
the report of the sermon.

1145
02:20:39,225 --> 02:20:42,525
The accused advised people to dispose
of their possessions and follow him.

1146
02:20:42,687 --> 02:20:46,025
How can Rome levy taxes on the people
if they follow his teaching?

1147
02:20:46,182 --> 02:20:48,927
Then the charge should be reduced
to one of evading the tax.

1148
02:20:49,094 --> 02:20:51,805
The charge stands as read.

1149
02:20:53,590 --> 02:20:54,887
Are you a king?

1150
02:20:58,887 --> 02:21:01,561
It is your own lips
that have called me king.

1151
02:21:02,307 --> 02:21:04,526
My kingdom is the kingdom of God.

1152
02:21:06,103 --> 02:21:07,944
Then you are a king.

1153
02:21:10,473 --> 02:21:14,512
I was born and came into this world
to give testimony to the truth.

1154
02:21:15,506 --> 02:21:18,349
Whoever believes in the truth
will listen to me.

1155
02:21:21,219 --> 02:21:22,391
What is truth?

1156
02:21:25,765 --> 02:21:28,689
Everyone that is of the truth
heareth my voice.

1157
02:21:29,727 --> 02:21:32,477
Different people have different feelings.

1158
02:21:33,059 --> 02:21:35,226
Can there not be more than one truth?

1159
02:21:36,594 --> 02:21:40,556
There is only one truth,
and it is written in the Commandments:

1160
02:21:40,881 --> 02:21:42,349
"Be true to God."

1161
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:46,270
My lord, the court deviates from the issue.
Truth is not on trial here...

1162
02:21:46,428 --> 02:21:49,147
...but a man named Jesus,
from Nazareth.

1163
02:21:49,473 --> 02:21:51,191
Nazareth.

1164
02:21:51,350 --> 02:21:53,398
You are a Galilean, then?

1165
02:21:53,561 --> 02:21:56,232
In that case,
Herod Antipas has jurisdiction over you.

1166
02:21:56,394 --> 02:21:57,733
He just returned to Jerusalem.

1167
02:21:57,891 --> 02:21:59,604
Send this man to Herod Antipas
for judgment.

1168
02:21:59,762 --> 02:22:02,849
If my lord please, Herod Antipas
is prejudiced against this man.

1169
02:22:03,006 --> 02:22:04,881
He could not be tried fairly there.

1170
02:22:05,048 --> 02:22:09,724
It is so ordered by this court.
The trial has ended. Caesar is satisfied.

1171
02:23:03,559 --> 02:23:07,063
Are you John the Baptist,
come back to life?

1172
02:23:07,229 --> 02:23:10,100
Can you not see he is not
John the Baptist?

1173
02:23:10,265 --> 02:23:12,557
Let him speak for himself.

1174
02:23:14,424 --> 02:23:17,549
I have heard you are
a very great miracle-worker.

1175
02:23:18,341 --> 02:23:22,221
I would be very happy to witness
a simple demonstration of your power.

1176
02:23:31,187 --> 02:23:33,354
Here is a vase of clay.

1177
02:23:35,139 --> 02:23:37,884
It is only a small vase.

1178
02:23:40,047 --> 02:23:42,049
Turn it into gold.

1179
02:23:45,845 --> 02:23:49,770
Surely that is not a great feat
for a man of your powers.

1180
02:24:03,588 --> 02:24:05,886
Still made of clay.

1181
02:24:08,802 --> 02:24:11,396
Perhaps that was too difficult for you.

1182
02:24:12,597 --> 02:24:15,225
Shall I ask of you something simpler?

1183
02:24:16,226 --> 02:24:17,318
Make it thunder.

1184
02:24:18,937 --> 02:24:21,479
It should be very easy for a messiah.

1185
02:24:23,179 --> 02:24:24,927
Make it thunder.

1186
02:24:45,225 --> 02:24:46,393
I hear nothing.

1187
02:24:48,718 --> 02:24:51,554
Seems that the great miracle-worker
has lost his touch.

1188
02:24:54,216 --> 02:24:58,437
Do not let it be said that Herod
does not know how to receive royalty.

1189
02:25:16,214 --> 02:25:17,466
There.

1190
02:25:17,924 --> 02:25:20,518
Does he not look like a king?

1191
02:25:26,182 --> 02:25:29,402
Take this faker back to Pilate.

1192
02:25:31,810 --> 02:25:34,897
Tell him Herod was not pleased
with his performance.

1193
02:25:48,889 --> 02:25:52,644
Scourge him! Loosen his tongue.
Make him confess.

1194
02:25:59,428 --> 02:26:02,049
What would you want him to confess,
Pilate?

1195
02:26:03,547 --> 02:26:06,096
- His conspiracy.
- What conspiracy?

1196
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:08,973
Take the miracles.

1197
02:26:09,678 --> 02:26:11,021
And what is his crime there?

1198
02:26:14,141 --> 02:26:18,146
He is different
and refuses to behave like the others.

1199
02:26:19,519 --> 02:26:21,232
Pilate.

1200
02:26:24,011 --> 02:26:29,553
If he can influence even Caesar's daughter,
he is dangerous.

1201
02:27:40,005 --> 02:27:41,097
What do you want?

1202
02:28:11,638 --> 02:28:14,187
A king should wear a crown.

1203
02:28:49,716 --> 02:28:52,305
If only the sun would set quickly.

1204
02:28:52,506 --> 02:28:55,009
What difference does it make?

1205
02:28:58,220 --> 02:29:00,473
Passover begins at sunset.

1206
02:29:00,848 --> 02:29:03,727
They cannot crucify us
during the holy days.

1207
02:29:03,892 --> 02:29:06,815
I would rather get it over with today.

1208
02:29:18,591 --> 02:29:22,266
How does it feel
to be about to die, Barabbas? Huh?

1209
02:29:24,848 --> 02:29:28,443
I only object to the company
that I will have to keep.

1210
02:29:30,894 --> 02:29:34,309
We are only thieves. You're a murderer.

1211
02:29:34,471 --> 02:29:36,888
It is we who should object
to your company.

1212
02:29:37,050 --> 02:29:38,548
Let him be.

1213
02:30:01,341 --> 02:30:03,555
So I have been given
the honor of going last?

1214
02:30:04,714 --> 02:30:07,217
You know the man named Jesus,
from Nazareth?

1215
02:30:08,176 --> 02:30:09,223
I know the man.

1216
02:30:10,303 --> 02:30:12,476
Does he deserve to die?

1217
02:30:12,639 --> 02:30:14,516
No more than I!

1218
02:30:20,890 --> 02:30:24,476
You compare yourself
in the same breath?

1219
02:30:25,715 --> 02:30:28,089
We both seek the same thing.

1220
02:30:28,381 --> 02:30:30,554
Freedom!

1221
02:30:32,301 --> 02:30:34,474
Only our methods differ.

1222
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:41,315
The freedom he spoke of
is not the same you killed for.

1223
02:30:51,005 --> 02:30:53,507
When is the man Jesus to die?

1224
02:30:55,509 --> 02:30:58,228
He carries his cross now.

1225
02:31:02,266 --> 02:31:04,394
Why do you tell me all this?

1226
02:31:04,852 --> 02:31:08,226
Why don't you take me with him?
Get it over with.

1227
02:31:12,135 --> 02:31:14,382
Go. You're free.

1228
02:31:26,391 --> 02:31:29,941
The man Jesus is dying in your place.

1229
02:31:31,143 --> 02:31:34,979
One prisoner is freed each year
at this time.

1230
02:31:36,218 --> 02:31:39,010
Pilate offered that mob a choice.

1231
02:31:42,091 --> 02:31:45,766
Me? They chose me?

1232
02:31:47,805 --> 02:31:50,684
Your followers yelled the loudest.

1233
02:31:51,392 --> 02:31:55,858
Go. Look at him who is dying for you.

1234
02:34:12,013 --> 02:34:14,687
You. Cyrenaican. Take the cross.

1235
02:35:18,049 --> 02:35:20,222
Do not weep for me.

1236
02:37:06,309 --> 02:37:08,681
That man is dying in my place.

1237
02:37:09,679 --> 02:37:11,473
Why should he do that?

1238
02:37:14,754 --> 02:37:16,882
I never did anything for him.

1239
02:37:38,005 --> 02:37:43,976
Forgive them, Father,
for they know not what they do.

1240
02:37:58,178 --> 02:38:00,641
If you are the Messiah...

1241
02:38:01,132 --> 02:38:05,053
...then save yourself and us.

1242
02:38:05,715 --> 02:38:08,184
Have you no fear of God?

1243
02:38:08,510 --> 02:38:10,012
We are guilty.

1244
02:38:10,595 --> 02:38:13,519
But this man has done no wrong.

1245
02:38:15,559 --> 02:38:20,398
Remember me, when we have come
into the glory of your kingdom.

1246
02:38:22,969 --> 02:38:24,762
I promise...

1247
02:38:26,255 --> 02:38:28,507
...you will be with me...

1248
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:31,889
...this day, in paradise.

1249
02:38:42,559 --> 02:38:43,898
Woman...

1250
02:38:45,388 --> 02:38:47,181
...behold your son.

1251
02:39:59,592 --> 02:40:01,385
My God.

1252
02:40:03,713 --> 02:40:07,434
My God, why have you forsaken me?

1253
02:40:21,138 --> 02:40:24,850
It is finished.

1254
02:40:33,386 --> 02:40:34,729
Father...

1255
02:40:37,557 --> 02:40:41,107
...into your hands I commend my soul.

1256
02:41:16,881 --> 02:41:19,225
He is truly the Christ.

1257
02:42:23,675 --> 02:42:28,515
And the body of Jesus
was begged from Pilate, and given over.

1258
02:43:12,423 --> 02:43:17,174
And in the place where he was crucified,
there was a garden.

1259
02:43:17,382 --> 02:43:21,057
And in the garden a new sepulcher,
hewn from stone.

1260
02:43:22,387 --> 02:43:25,015
And Jesus was placed there.

1261
02:45:23,388 --> 02:45:24,981
Sir.

1262
02:45:25,765 --> 02:45:27,438
Sir.

1263
02:45:30,141 --> 02:45:32,138
Sir, have you hidden him?

1264
02:45:32,304 --> 02:45:34,891
Tell me where, and I will take him away.

1265
02:45:35,050 --> 02:45:36,548
Woman, why do you weep?

1266
02:45:36,714 --> 02:45:40,180
Because you have taken away my Lord.
I know not where.

1267
02:45:44,718 --> 02:45:46,812
- Magdalene.
- Master.

1268
02:45:46,971 --> 02:45:50,726
Touch me not,
for I am not yet ascended to my father.

1269
02:45:50,891 --> 02:45:53,062
But go to my disciples.

1270
02:45:53,808 --> 02:45:58,052
Tell them I ascend to my father
and your father.

1271
02:45:59,259 --> 02:46:03,006
To my god and your god.

1272
02:46:03,713 --> 02:46:06,466
But first, I go before them into Galilee.

1273
02:46:07,634 --> 02:46:09,728
There shall they see me.

1274
02:46:22,051 --> 02:46:23,845
He is arisen.

1275
02:46:36,639 --> 02:46:41,063
And when the tomb
was found empty, some days passed...

1276
02:46:41,432 --> 02:46:46,302
...and Christ was seen at Emmaus
and in Jerusalem.

1277
02:46:46,883 --> 02:46:51,255
And those who saw him
knew he was the Lord God.

1278
02:46:52,214 --> 02:46:55,184
And then a final time he came
among his disciples...

1279
02:46:55,342 --> 02:46:57,219
...by the shore of Galilee.

1280
02:46:57,386 --> 02:46:59,730
Do you know and love me?

1281
02:47:02,182 --> 02:47:05,933
Feed my sheep,
for my sheep are in all the nations.

1282
02:47:07,013 --> 02:47:09,510
Go you into all the world
and preach the Gospel...

1283
02:47:09,677 --> 02:47:12,094
...to every creature who hungers.

1284
02:47:12,964 --> 02:47:15,089
I am with you always.

1285
02:47:15,880 --> 02:47:18,884
Even until the end of the world.
