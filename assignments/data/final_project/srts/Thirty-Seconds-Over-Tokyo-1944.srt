1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,429
Yes? Just a minute. Your call, Colonel.

3
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,028
Thank you.

4
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,268
Hello. Captain York, please.

5
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,005
You know, if this thing works out,

6
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,671
it might give our boys all the way
from Bataan to Singapore a big lift.

7
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,577
And it may pull a lot of
Japs back to their islands.

8
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:13,582
- It'll work out, General.
- I'm sure it will.

9
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,182
Hello. Hello, York? Doolittle.

10
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:21,416
York, I want you to get 24
B-25s with volunteer crews

11
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:24,187
down to Eglin Field as soon as you can.

12
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,224
The job will take them out of the
country for about three months.

13
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,198
Tell them it's a secret mission.

14
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,167
They won't know where they're
going until they get there.

15
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,261
That's right, volunteers.

16
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,735
Tell them they're not to talk
to anybody. That's an order.

17
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:42,470
I'll join you in a few days. Right.

18
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,509
Zero-two-two-four-one
to Eglin Tower.

19
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,055
Three B-25s request traffic
and landing instructions.

20
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:54,180
Go ahead.

21
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,225
<i>Army four-one. The
left-hand pattern.</i>

22
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,226
<i>Wind direction north by northeast.</i>

23
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,455
<i>Land on runway number three.</i>

24
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,462
There's the field all right.

25
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:05,023
Boy, did you ever see such a wide runway?

26
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,101
She's big all right.

27
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,727
You could almost close your eyes and get in.

28
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,863
And I'd give plenty to
know where we go from here.

29
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,031
Yeah, so would I.

30
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,008
Hey, don't do anything till I get my camera.

31
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,279
How does she look from the nose, Clever?

32
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:22,444
Great. Florida, palm trees,
alligators, bathing beauties.

33
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,013
Hey, Thatcher, have a
look at some real country.

34
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,523
It's not as pretty as Billings, sir.

35
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,559
Did you keep the cookies this trip, Thatcher?

36
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:35,121
Yes, sir. I had a little trouble coming
over the mountains, but I hung on.

37
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,626
<i>- Zero-two-two-four-one to
flight. - Hey, wait a minute.</i>

38
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,497
We'll go around, make an echelon right

39
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,266
<i>once over the field, then break
away. Let's make it pretty.</i>

40
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,799
Here's for luck.

41
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,500
Switch is off!

42
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:30,076
- 5:25. Not bad time.
- Yeah, we moved.

43
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,553
Better write that left engine
up. She sounded a little rough.

44
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:34,419
Boy, I got some swell shots, Lawson.

45
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,550
You really made a nice break away.
Gave me kind of an artistic angle.

46
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,925
Some day I'll do a crash landing
so you can get a real movie.

47
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:42,521
Thatcher says that Florida
can't compare to Billings.

48
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:45,192
Trouble with Thatcher is he thinks
that any place with more than 300 people

49
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,532
- is overcrowded.
- Oh, according to the last census, sir,

50
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:50,697
Billings has a population of 16,380.

51
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:54,732
16,000! Oh, no, Thatcher, you must
be thinking of Greater Billings.

52
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:58,542
No, he's right, Clever. They
count the cows up in that country.

53
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,808
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes.

54
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,715
- Cameras aren't allowed on the field.
- What?

55
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:04,912
That's right, sir.

56
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:08,219
A lot of secret work goes on here,
and they're very strict about it.

57
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,986
Well, I can't see anything secret from here.

58
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,924
Then I'll have to report you
to the Commanding Officer, sir.

59
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,189
Those are my orders.

60
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:14,820
Okay. Okay.

61
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,764
Hey, look, Brick Holstrom's still with us.

62
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,166
We were afraid you wouldn't get
that turkey in till tomorrow.

63
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,567
Why, that baby flies so pretty

64
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,901
we floated the last 200 miles.

65
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:26,737
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah. Come on, Brick.

66
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,505
Oh, Thatcher, I'll be right back
and tell you where your quarters are.

67
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,841
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,612
Come on, Davey, you've got
an idea. What's the dope?

69
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:36,049
- Where do we go from here?
- I already told you.

70
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,349
All they said was that it'd
take us out of the country,

71
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,787
we'd be gone about three months
and that it'd be dangerous.

72
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,621
Look, I got the real dope from Joe Randall.

73
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:46,524
He says they're forming patrol
squadrons to guard the Canal.

74
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,087
What's dangerous about Canal patrol?

75
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,462
Well, what are we worrying about?

76
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:53,058
Ski will give us all the
dope when we check in anyhow.

77
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,607
Three ships in, sir.
Holstrom, Lawson, and myself.

78
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:01,074
- Good. Your ships okay?
- Yes, sir.

79
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,406
Sit down.

80
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:04,804
Where we staying, Ski?

81
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,576
The government's leased a hotel near here.

82
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,549
They call it the Officers' Club.

83
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,882
The men whose wives are
coming can stay there.

84
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,080
The other officers'
quarters are in Barracks 5.

85
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,248
Is Emmy coming down?

86
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,787
- She'll be here in a couple of days.
- Where'll I put Thatcher, Ski?

87
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,919
The enlisted men are assigned to Barracks 12.

88
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:21,355
Okay.

89
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,427
- Anything else?
- Nope?

90
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,033
At least, not until tomorrow morning.

91
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,034
Well, we'll be seeing you.

92
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,910
Say, Ski, the guys are all
crazy to know what's up.

93
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:40,983
You know as much about it as I do.

94
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,917
We may be given more
information in the morning.

95
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,836
Well, beat me, daddy! Look who's coming!

96
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:05,931
Well, well, well, plant
me now and dig me later,

97
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,636
if it isn't the pride of
Randolph Field. How are you, boy?

98
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:10,702
Great, Shorty. The minute
we heard that razzmatazz,

99
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,577
we knew you must be somewhere around.

100
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:14,946
- You volunteer for this deal, too?
- Sure enough.

101
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,783
They had me stationed up in Minneapolis.
Coldest country I ever did see.

102
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,653
I'd have volunteered for anything
to get back in the sunshine.

103
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:24,454
- Where you been?
- Columbia, South Carolina.

104
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,084
- Bob!
- Hello, Ted.

105
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:27,390
You guys know each other?

106
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,260
Oh, we just went through
Kelly together, that's all.

107
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:32,028
- Sure. Bob was bridesmaid at my wedding.
- Wedding?

108
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,069
Nobody tells me anything anymore.

109
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,264
How long you been balled up and chained down?

110
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,739
Six months, in five more days.

111
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:41,709
Well, blow my foot off. Skin me again, boy.

112
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,404
Hey, Davey, what are you doing down here?

113
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,071
- Brick!
- Hi, Don.

114
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:48,015
- I thought you were hunting subs.
- Was. Got me one, too.

115
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,109
- You in on this deal?
- Sure. I've got a swell crew

116
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:53,212
and it looked like it was going
to be something, so why not?

117
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,624
- Any ideas what we might be up to?
- Oh, just a hunch.

118
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,521
Yeah? Well, give.

119
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:03,159
South Seas. Knock ourselves
off a few meatballs.

120
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,659
Yeah?

121
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,141
Three.

122
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:23,651
Honest man. Dealer takes two.

123
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,645
- You know, I just got an idea.
- About what?

124
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,553
About where we might be going.

125
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:32,151
The way it looks to... No,
that's not right. Forget it.

126
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,690
Says two.

127
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:36,491
- You know, I've got an idea too.
- Yeah?

128
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,700
I've got an idea you're pretty much of a dope

129
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,032
to have come in on this
deal in the first place.

130
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,298
What kind of a crack is that?

131
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,268
Oh, I don't know. You're
married. You've got a swell girl.

132
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,377
I never would have stuck my
neck out if I were in your boots.

133
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,243
Go away. You say two?

134
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,181
And up two.

135
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,610
Those guys are off again.

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,857
Hey, stand up there.
Who do you think you are?

137
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:14,700
Have you ever carried a navigator
in your ship before, Spike?

138
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,598
Neither have I, until I
volunteered for this job.

139
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,767
Oh, we're going to see some fancy stuff,
all right. I kind of got a feeling.

140
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:22,310
Shoot me for a pole cat.

141
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:25,472
Do I see two red-blooded
citizens lying on their backsides

142
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,539
while the Texas anthem is being rendered?

143
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,380
On your feet, men.

144
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:31,778
What are you beefing about,
Shorty? You're from Virginia.

145
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,151
That's right, sharp cat,

146
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:36,123
but my pal here, he's from
Texas, and he takes offense easy.

147
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,922
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Joyce. I've got some news.

148
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,860
Hey, you guys, shut up!

149
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:44,289
Quiet, fellows. Listen.
Jimmy Doolittle's down here

150
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,034
and he's a Lieutenant Colonel now.

151
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:50,766
Jimmy Doolittle! A southern
boy from Southern California.

152
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,435
<i>Let's have Eyes of Texas for
Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle.</i>

153
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,448
Attention!

154
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,181
Gentlemen, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle.

155
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:07,888
As you were.

156
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,525
You men are here because you've volunteered.

157
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,503
You have been told it's a dangerous mission.

158
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:26,598
I can't tell you any more than that
now, but I want to emphasize the danger.

159
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,542
The most important thing
at the moment is secrecy.

160
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:35,740
I don't want you to even tell
your wives what you see down here.

161
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,785
And if you think you've
guessed where you're going,

162
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,219
you're probably wrong. But
don't even talk about your guess.

163
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,587
If the slightest word about
this mission gets around,

164
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:47,652
you will endanger not only your own lives,
but the lives of thousands of other men.

165
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:51,264
Now I want to ask you a question.

166
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,870
Has anybody tried to talk to you about this?

167
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,802
Good. If anybody on the
field or off the field

168
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:00,569
tries to engage you in conversation

169
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:03,510
as to why you're here,
no matter how innocently,

170
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,103
I want you to get his name and give it to me

171
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,547
and I'll turn it over to the FBI.

172
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,792
This is going to be the toughest
training you've ever had.

173
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:24,292
You will have the same crew all
the way through and the same ship.

174
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:29,200
And the man or the ship
that fails will be dropped.

175
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:34,333
You're going to do things with a
B-25 you thought were impossible.

176
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:38,635
Now, if any of you have any doubts,
I'd like you to drop out right now

177
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:41,706
and I promise you that no one
will ever think the worse of you.

178
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,116
If you have wives or children
or any other considerations

179
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:47,485
that might get on your nerves in
a crisis, it's perfectly all right.

180
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:50,650
As a matter of fact, it's
your duty to drop out.

181
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:58,093
Very well. We'll have these talks
as often as possible. That's all.

182
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,703
We're going up this morning
for an orientation flight.

183
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:08,301
There are four auxiliary
fields. One, two, three, four.

184
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,812
Line them up and locate them all.

185
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,043
We don't know which we're going to
use for our confidential experiments,

186
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:18,052
so familiarize yourselves with all of them.

187
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,321
Look over the countryside,
and we'll meet here again

188
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,483
at 3:30 this afternoon.
Are there any questions?

189
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,652
Sir, the plugs are being
changed in my engines.

190
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,062
To save time, may I go along in Jones' ship?

191
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:33,431
Right, Smith. All right.
You can go to your ship now.

192
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,966
It looks to me like it's
going to be a long time

193
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,405
before you swing down Main Street
of Billings again, Thatcher.

194
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:42,171
In Billings, sir, the main
street is Minnesota Avenue.

195
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,308
You know, that guy really means business.

196
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:49,317
- He had me sweating a little.
- Yeah, me too.

197
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,046
- Lieutenant Lawson?
- Yes.

198
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,554
Someone to see you out in front
of the PX at J Street, sir.

199
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:56,284
Thanks. I wonder who would...

200
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,788
I'll be right back.

201
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,359
Ellen!

202
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,996
- Where did you come from?
- I drove to Carolina to surprise you.

203
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:15,476
- And then they told me you're down here.
- Well, how are you?

204
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,876
I'm just fine, thank you.
And how are you bearing up?

205
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,245
Oh, great. You look just the same.

206
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:24,047
Well, of course I do. You can't
expect any change this soon.

207
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,912
- What's the joke?
- Nothing.

208
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,354
Except you're so funny.

209
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,324
Tell me, honey, were you surprised?

210
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:34,192
Oh, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Here, let me buy you a drink.

211
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,293
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

212
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:50,841
Come on, let's go around here.

213
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:08,728
Tell me, honey, how come you're so cute?

214
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:12,631
I had to be if I were going to
get such a good looking fellow.

215
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,631
You know, there's a lot of things
I want to talk over with you.

216
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:20,266
Go ahead. Were you really surprised?

217
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,142
Well, no, not exactly.

218
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,237
You know, you go into something
like this with your eyes open.

219
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:29,580
- Naturally you've got to take your chances.
- I see.

220
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:33,245
Isn't that kind of a
cold-blooded way to look at it?

221
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:36,189
Oh, now, don't get mad. You've
got to be cold-blooded about it.

222
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,453
This is the most important
thing that's ever happened to me.

223
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,495
- What about me?
- Well, you're in on it, too.

224
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:44,397
- That's why I want to talk it over.
- That's very generous. Go on, Ted.

225
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,798
Well, in the first place,
we've got to keep it a secret.

226
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:50,066
- I don't want you to tell a soul.
- You're not, I mean, you...

227
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,868
You don't wish it hadn't happened, do you?

228
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,238
Oh, no, of course not.

229
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,573
But it's a military
secret, I've got my orders.

230
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,408
Military... Say, what are you talking about?

231
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
Well, this job I volunteered
for. Didn't you get my letter?

232
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:04,347
- No. Didn't you get mine?
- No.

233
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,880
Well, I suppose it's very funny, but...

234
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,357
- Hey, Lawson! Ted Lawson!
- Here.

235
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,291
What are you hiding out...

236
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:15,694
- Ellen, when did you get here?
- Five minutes ago. How's my bridesmaid?

237
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,164
Great. Only I'm going
to have to break this up.

238
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,599
Doolittle came out to watch us take off.

239
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,229
Okay. I'll see you for dinner.

240
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,637
There's a hotel about a mile
and a half down the road.

241
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,200
I haven't seen it yet, but
they tell me you can't miss it.

242
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,770
- I'll find it.
- I'm sorry to have to rush off like this.

243
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,786
Don't forget dinner.

244
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:57,435
Say, did anybody pick up a letter for me?

245
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:02,473
Yes, sir. I did this morning.
I forgot all about it.

246
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,873
<i>- Well, bring it up.
- Yes, sir.</i>

247
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:20,654
I'm sorry, sir.

248
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,890
Okay. Thanks. Take over, will you, Davenport.

249
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,091
Sure.

250
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:35,470
Hey! I'm going to have a baby!

251
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:36,544
Hey, it's from Ellen.

252
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:40,070
She's going to be... I mean,
I'm going to be a father.

253
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,828
Hello, flyer.

254
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,392
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.

255
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,665
I wasn't sleeping, really. I
was just dozing and thinking.

256
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:40,439
I'm sorry I didn't get back for
dinner. We had a lot of checking to do.

257
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:45,004
You must've thought I was
an awful dope this morning.

258
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:49,315
But I didn't get your letter
until later, so I didn't know.

259
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:51,579
I know. Sit down.

260
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:05,496
- I think it's swell about the baby.
- I knew you would. I wasn't a bit worried.

261
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,528
You know, it's going to seem funny.

262
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:12,165
I don't care whether it's a
boy or a girl. Not that much.

263
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,668
I just want you to be
okay. It's pretty serious.

264
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:20,115
- Well, what's so funny?
- I was just thinking.

265
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:25,016
Here you're getting ready to go
off on something really tough,

266
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:27,348
and you're worrying about me.

267
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,823
If I were in your spot,
I'd be scared to death.

268
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,063
- But I guess I am anyhow.
- Purely routine stuff, flyer.

269
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:41,193
The kind of job every girl takes
on once or twice in her life.

270
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,371
Why don't you lie down?

271
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,476
You know, Ellen,

272
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,211
I'm kind of glad I got you.

273
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:02,081
I guess that's what I was
thinking about in my sleep.

274
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,348
It almost frightened me.

275
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:07,987
It seemed that I was thinking,
"What if I'd never met him?"

276
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,325
Well, for one thing

277
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,992
you wouldn't be traipsing around the country

278
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,730
from one airfield to another
trying to catch up with me.

279
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,532
And for another,

280
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,174
you wouldn't be having a baby
right in the middle of a war.

281
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,211
Oh, no, it wasn't that.

282
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,337
I was thinking that if I hadn't met you,

283
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:30,914
I'd never have felt really close
to anybody, never in my whole life.

284
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:38,388
Married six months and
together less than two weeks.

285
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,894
That's not being as close as I'd figured on.

286
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,431
Don't you see, Ted, that's just it.

287
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:47,366
If people can be close when
they're far away from each other,

288
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,034
well, that's what it should be.

289
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,368
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

290
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:55,407
Cuddle me.

291
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,515
I was thinking about last Christmas.

292
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,281
The tree we set up in
that Portland auto court.

293
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,880
- Wasn't it an awful little room?
- Yeah.

294
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,517
And the Christmas dinner we were planning on.

295
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:15,324
And then you ran out of gas and
landed in the mud up in lllwaco,

296
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:19,390
Christmas Eve and Christmas were
all over before I saw you again.

297
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,631
Yeah, that was tough. But I
got a scarf out of it, anyhow.

298
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,330
Well, it wasn't exactly as we'd planned it.

299
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:29,605
It was our first Christmas,
and somewhere way off,

300
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,472
it didn't matter where,

301
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:36,347
I knew I had you. Oh, Ted, it was
the nicest Christmas of my life.

302
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:42,987
You were born to marry a flyer, Ellen.
I knew that the minute I first saw you.

303
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,718
As a matter of fact that's why I married you.

304
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,887
- You know, I've got a confession to make.
- What?

305
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:52,798
The truth is, you didn't
marry me. I married you.

306
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,463
Oh, you did, eh?

307
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:59,567
The first time I saw you
in the library at LACC,

308
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,474
I said to myself, "Oh, oh, that's for me. "

309
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:03,904
And from then on,

310
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,380
clear up to the night we got the judge
out of bed in that little Idaho town,

311
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,314
nothing was an accident, Ted.

312
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,750
I planned it that way.

313
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:16,386
- You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
- I'm not sure whether I do or not.

314
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,458
You see, you didn't put up much of a fight.

315
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,723
I suppose you figured out on that baby, too?

316
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,598
That's something you'll never
know, flyer, you'll never know.

317
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,773
Boys are working late these nights.

318
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:46,048
Yes. Do you have any idea
how long you'll be gone?

319
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,820
But as soon as this job is over,
I'm going to ask for a leave.

320
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,792
Two, maybe three weeks.

321
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:55,125
We'll have that honeymoon
you're always talking about.

322
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,427
Yes, just the three of us.

323
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:02,863
Ted.

324
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:08,807
I do hope I don't get big and
fat like that lady in Chicago.

325
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,617
I want each one of you to know
something about the other man's job.

326
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:20,416
The pilots will practice
every job on the plane.

327
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:23,856
Navigators will learn the work
of bombardiers and so forth.

328
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:26,358
That's in case any of you get shot up.

329
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,362
There's one thing more.

330
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,963
It is inevitable that some of your planes

331
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,659
are going to fall into
the hands of the enemy.

332
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:35,134
For this reason, I have ordered
your Norden bombsights removed.

333
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:39,606
Captain Greening has designed a sight
which will be perfect for our job.

334
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,442
If there are no questions, I'll
ask Captain York to take over.

335
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,674
Just like I said, we patrol off Brazil.

336
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:49,239
Yeah, but what about taking
the Norden Bombsight out?

337
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:52,514
There's no chance of falling into the
hands of the enemy if you're hunting subs.

338
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:56,717
- I hadn't thought of that.
- That Doolittle's a cheerful cuss, isn't he?

339
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,523
"Just in case any of us are
shot up," a bundle of sunshine.

340
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,668
Oh, it's Ted, it's Ted!

341
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:11,532
George used to buzz me
when we were first married.

342
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:14,575
He doesn't do it any more.
They're not supposed to.

343
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,803
- I wonder if he still loves me.
- I wouldn't worry about that.

344
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:21,144
Every time Ski gets a new ship he
has a terrible love affair with it,

345
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:22,774
but he always comes back to me,

346
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:24,375
especially when he's hungry.

347
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:27,286
Just think, they'll be gone three months.

348
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,653
I think I'll get a job in a defense factory.

349
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:32,921
I couldn't stand just sitting around
in some little apartment and waiting.

350
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,188
What are you going to do, Ellen?

351
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:37,527
Oh, I'm just going to sit
around and have a baby.

352
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,061
- A baby!
- A baby!

353
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:40,658
Ellen, why didn't you tell us?

354
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:43,898
I don't know. I guess I just
never thought of a way till now.

355
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,532
As it turns out, it
wasn't hard to tell at all.

356
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,701
Well, I'm going to have one, too.

357
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,210
- What?
- Really?

358
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:52,405
Gee, I think it's wonderful.

359
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:56,083
George and I have talked about it,
but, well, with him away and all,

360
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:59,245
- I guess I'm just too scared.
- I thought I would be too, but...

361
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,915
Well, Ted and I figured that
everything since Pearl Harbor

362
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,981
has just been so much velvet.

363
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,290
And then I guessed that if
anything should happen to him,

364
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,387
only I know nothing will,

365
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:13,696
I'd have the baby, and that would
be a little bit of Ted still living.

366
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:16,635
I sometimes wonder how we'll
feel when it's all over.

367
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,106
Just think, being able to settle
down in a little house somewhere

368
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:23,542
and raise your children and
never be in doubt about anything.

369
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,239
We'll probably have exactly the same doubts

370
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:26,439
that we have right now.

371
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:29,678
For example, will he or will
he not be home for dinner?

372
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,487
We're about to enter the most
secret part of our training.

373
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,889
This field is patrolled on all sides
so no one can disturb you at your work.

374
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:40,223
Gentlemen, this is
Lieutenant Miller of the Navy.

375
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,559
He's going to instruct you in takeoffs.

376
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:47,330
Instead of the normal B-25 takeoff
in 1,500 feet at 90 miles an hour,

377
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,801
he's going to show you how to do it

378
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,931
with a full load of bombs and gas
in 500 feet at 50 miles an hour.

379
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:57,274
You will attempt no short takeoffs

380
00:24:57,345 --> 00:25:00,178
from Eglin Field, where people can see you.

381
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,882
Lieutenant Miller will also give you
a few short talks on naval etiquette.

382
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:07,353
Now, if this gives you any
hints as to your destination

383
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,084
or as to what kind of
work you're going to do,

384
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,854
don't even discuss it among yourselves.

385
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,397
I'll ask Lieutenant Miller to take over now.

386
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:21,233
Gentlemen,

387
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:27,867
those flags out there are at
100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 feet

388
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,570
from the starting line.

389
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:33,102
The line down the center of the
field is to guide you in your takeoff.

390
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:37,015
The kind of work you're going to
do won't permit any deviations.

391
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:40,521
Now, the whole idea is to get up full
power before you release your brakes.

392
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:43,683
Then start, at maximum r.
p. m., manifold pressure

393
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,025
and with your wing flaps all the way down.

394
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:48,961
You'll have to rev your motors until
you think they're going to burn up.

395
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,793
And then, when they reach the right pitch,

396
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:53,834
and that's a matter of sound
and feel more than instruments,

397
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:55,767
release your brakes and hunt for heaven.

398
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:58,601
I don't expect any of you
to do it the first time.

399
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:00,106
- Gray.
- Yes, sir.

400
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,733
Suppose you and Manch try it first?

401
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,836
The rest of us will stay on the ground,
mark your takeoff and check the wind.

402
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:05,913
Yes, sir.

403
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,279
I think at first we can learn
as much by watching trial runs

404
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,113
as by actually flying the ships.

405
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:13,450
So let's all line up over
here and see how he does.

406
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:48,085
- What kind of surface wind, Ski?
- Eight miles an hour.

407
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:51,148
He didn't have his engines revved up enough.

408
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,023
Lawson, you go next.

409
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:54,322
Now remember, for our purposes,

410
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:56,455
if you get your wheels a foot off
the ground, that's good enough.

411
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,396
You don't need height, but
you've got to get your wheels off

412
00:26:58,466 --> 00:26:59,933
before you hit the last flag.

413
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,868
A little later we'll try retracting
the wheels at around 450 feet

414
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:04,564
and relying on your motors to float the ship.

415
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,233
- Don't try that just yet, though.
- Right, sir.

416
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,676
Now, grab the column and pull her until
you feel the inside of your backbone.

417
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:12,042
Yes, sir.

418
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,764
Did you ever take off
a B-25 at 500 feet, sir?

419
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,766
No. But you men will. Don't worry about it.

420
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,133
Watch Lawson there.

421
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:40,368
You'll have to rev your motors at
least that high and maybe higher.

422
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:57,652
About 700 feet. He burned his tailskid.
Didn't pull his wheels up soon enough.

423
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:13,239
Brother, that takeoff
was strictly on the cob.

424
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:17,005
That airplane of yours looked
exactly like a ruptured duck.

425
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,477
How do you like this guy?

426
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:20,946
He takes off like an old lady in a high wind,

427
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:23,040
and then he's got the nerve
to talk about a real ship.

428
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,144
It's lucky you didn't have a muddy
field, or you'd still be there.

429
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:30,590
If I were you I'd worry about that turkey
you and Gray are pushing around the sky.

430
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:35,595
- The ruptured duck will get along okay.
- Oh, I'm insulted. Come on, fellows.

431
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,198
That won't take long to fix, sir.

432
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:42,759
Ruptured duck.

433
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,913
Ted.

434
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,281
Don't you think Linda's a
good name, if it's a girl?

435
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,544
Oh, yes, yes, it's fine.

436
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:04,583
No, maybe Nichola. Nichola?

437
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:07,789
That has a nice sound, don't you think?

438
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:11,827
What's that? Oh, yes.

439
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,858
Look, honey, we don't have to
decide that right now, do we?

440
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:16,995
No.

441
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:23,736
Ted.

442
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:27,341
He wasn't badly hurt, was he?

443
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,175
- Who?
- Johnny Adams.

444
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:33,049
- How'd you hear about Johnny?
- Those things get around.

445
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:35,783
- He wasn't hurt, was he?
- Of course not.

446
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,722
I don't know how those things get started.

447
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:40,556
Every time a guy does a noseover
on this field, it's a crack-up.

448
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:41,686
Ted.

449
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:47,361
You've been working ever since
dinner. Come on, let's get some air.

450
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,236
It's a deal.

451
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,103
Nice.

452
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,382
I'm sorry we haven't had
more time together, Ellen.

453
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:09,350
We can spare a little. We've
got all the rest of our lives.

454
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,392
That's right.

455
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:18,723
Something blooming? It
smells good, doesn't it?

456
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:20,625
- Ted.
- What?

457
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:22,727
Please, don't worry about anything.

458
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:26,103
I'm not worrying, just working, that's all.

459
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,835
You know, this is going to be quite a deal.

460
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,539
You're not worried about the deal.
You're worried because you've got a wife.

461
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:34,479
And that's wrong, Ted.

462
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,412
Say, Bob Gray hasn't been
trying to scare you, has he?

463
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:40,283
- Of course not.
- Okay.

464
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,446
Because there's nothing
to worry about, nothing.

465
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,219
Silly, as if I didn't know that.

466
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:46,988
Besides, if anything did happen, you've
got all that government insurance,

467
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:50,519
that'll take care of you and
the baby for a long while.

468
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,633
Oh, what am I talking about?
Nothing's going to happen anyhow.

469
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:58,638
Ted, look at me.

470
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:03,341
That baby and I, we won't
ever need anything but you.

471
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:06,780
We mustn't either of us
be scared about it, Ted.

472
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:11,308
Because the baby, the baby's why
I know you're coming back to us.

473
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:59,026
We'd better make this one, or Shorty'll
never let us hear the last of it.

474
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,192
Yeah.

475
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:35,100
- Hear those engines?
- Like music.

476
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,323
Come on, you hopped up bus drivers.

477
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,301
It's been 10 weeks work and
one night's fun. Let's go.

478
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,894
- I got my flaps up, brother.
- Heat it up there, Smitty boy.

479
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:14,601
Steam and sizzle. Where you're
going, no one's gonna hold you tight.

480
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,735
Hey there, Doc, don't you know how to dance?

481
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,745
When they start picking
flak out of your feet,

482
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,644
you'll wish you'd put them to better use.

483
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:23,343
I'm a doctor, not a jitterbug, Shorty.

484
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,301
- Hey, what gives?
- Shorty's throwing a party.

485
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,427
A party? What for?

486
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:45,836
Somebody said he's celebrating
Texas Constitution Day.

487
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:49,866
- Texas Constitution Day?
- Say, I'm gonna sample this.

488
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:01,888
Grab your gal, Lawson.

489
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,651
Don't you know it's Sam Houston's birthday?

490
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:04,725
Sam Houston?

491
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,818
For a guy that never saw Texas,
that Manch is really sold.

492
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:10,591
- Hi, Lawson.
- Hi. How did this riot get started?

493
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,155
It's Texas Admission Day.

494
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:15,327
And that ain't no riot, mister,
that's a full-fledged war.

495
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:17,837
- Seen Ellen?
- I've seen everybody.

496
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,886
- Hello, flyer.
- My dance?

497
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:34,046
All of them, my boy.

498
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:37,455
Every dance from now on
out, including the last one.

499
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,087
And I love you, Ski. I love
you, I love you, I love you.

500
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:28,001
You know, it's a funny thing. That
Lawson used to be about as graceful

501
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:30,236
as a Texas steer. Now, look at him.

502
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:32,302
Maybe the girl's got something to do with it.

503
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,041
Ah, you said it that time, Clever.

504
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:41,110
You know, there's something
I mean to tell you more often,

505
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,846
- but I never seem to get the chance.
- What is it?

506
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,416
Just that I love you.

507
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:57,260
I got a letter from your mother
this morning. Forgot to tell you.

508
00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,829
She said to take good care of you.

509
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,067
- How am I doing?
- Better than mother ever dreamed of.

510
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,656
Here. Here.

511
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,551
Now smile and sing.

512
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:53,550
Ted.

513
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,118
Telephone's ringing.

514
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:00,994
- Telephone, Ted.
- Oh, sure.

515
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:13,164
Yeah? Right now? Okay.

516
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:15,333
Okay.

517
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:17,874
Okay.

518
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:19,344
What was it?

519
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,207
Oh, just another night
call. But what a night.

520
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:25,249
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:26,945
What time is it?

522
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,381
3:10.

523
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:33,786
- Hung-over maybe a little?
- Oh, just a headache.

524
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:37,158
- I'm not used to party life.
- Poor baby.

525
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,327
You go to sleep. I'll be
back by breakfast time.

526
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:46,972
I'm so sleepy. Goodnight, darling.

527
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,377
Or rather, good morning.

528
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:55,739
Boy, if I ever get a leave, I'm
going to sleep for six days solid.

529
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:57,716
I wonder what this is.

530
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,390
Well, men, your ships are all
serviced, gassed, and ready to go.

531
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:16,928
You will take off in shifts,

532
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,936
the first shift taking off in 45 minutes.

533
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:23,041
Captain York will give you your clearances.

534
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:27,245
Now there's one thing that
must be thoroughly understood.

535
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:28,576
After you take off this morning,

536
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:34,110
you are to see no one, speak to no one,
telephone no one, not even your wife.

537
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,457
There are no exceptions.

538
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,152
Continue your gas consumption
tests to your destination.

539
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:46,964
Now, the work you will be asked to do
will require a little low altitude flying,

540
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,228
so hedge-hopping on this
trip is perfectly okay.

541
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:54,097
Only bear in mind that
cowboys wear pretty tall hats,

542
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:57,906
so watch your step, men. That's all.

543
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:03,543
I think you're very well prepared
for what you volunteered to do

544
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:08,619
and I want to thank you
for a lot of good hard work.

545
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:11,751
I'll see you in a few days. Good luck.

546
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,420
I hope I get a chance to tell Ellen goodbye.

547
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,520
Yeah, you will.

548
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:19,031
Your destination is Alameda field.

549
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,831
Take the southern route,
refuel at San Antonio and march.

550
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:28,500
As your names are called you can
start. First flight, Holstrom,

551
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,111
Jones, Lawson. Second flight...

552
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:46,189
- Ted.
- Well, this is it, honey. We're off.

553
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,454
- How soon?
- Just got time to pack.

554
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,927
Where's my B-4 bag?

555
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,464
- In the closet. I'll get it.
- Good.

556
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:58,300
Socks, shirts.

557
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:03,342
- My ties in the closet?
- Yes, I have them.

558
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,502
Good.

559
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:15,087
Wow! Don't go in there in your
bare feet, I broke a glass.

560
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:16,520
All right.

561
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:19,916
- You forgot your toothbrush.
- Oh, doggone it.

562
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,592
- We got everything?
- I think so.

563
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:28,828
Swell.

564
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:45,184
Well, be a good girl and
take good care of that baby.

565
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,247
- I will, Ted.
- Yourself, too.

566
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:55,092
Oh, Ted, I'm going to write you
a letter every day you're gone,

567
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:57,062
I know they won't deliver
them. I won't even mail them.

568
00:41:57,131 --> 00:42:00,931
But I'm going to write just the same.
That way, we'll kind of be in touch.

569
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:03,495
That way, we'll feel close.

570
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:12,440
Goodbye.

571
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,014
Bye, flyer.

572
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,479
Tell me, honey. How come you're so cute?

573
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:27,026
I had to be if I was gonna
get such a good looking fellow.

574
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:30,564
I'll be back.

575
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:43,501
Hey, the Bay Bridge is off to our right.

576
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,095
The Bay Bridge is off to our right.

577
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:49,809
The Bay Bridge? How about flying under it?

578
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,175
- For why?
- Well, so I can get some pictures.

579
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:54,271
You know, shooting up at the superstructure.

580
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:56,282
- Come on, Lawson.
- Do you want to?

581
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,547
- Sure. Go ahead, if it'll make him happy.
- Thanks.

582
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:02,347
I hope there are no cables
hanging under that span.

583
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:03,822
Here we go.

584
00:44:21,508 --> 00:44:24,568
Let's take a turn and go it
again. I forgot to put film in.

585
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:26,442
We're due at the field. Forget it.

586
00:44:26,513 --> 00:44:28,208
Oh, I may never get another crack at it.

587
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:29,647
Hey, look.

588
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,147
McClure, take a look down there.

589
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,324
- It's a carrier.
- Yeah. And look at her deck.

590
00:44:39,693 --> 00:44:43,652
B-25's. Holy Smoke. Then this is it.

591
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:45,798
Kind of small, isn't she?

592
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:50,360
Pilot to bombardier. Pilot
to gunner. Pilot to gunner.

593
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,200
Thatcher. Thatcher.

594
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,300
It's dead again.

595
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,775
We'd better report it to
Doolittle when we get in.

596
00:44:56,844 --> 00:45:01,178
Yeah, that left engine along with
it. Still seem a little rough to you?

597
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:03,580
I can't tell anymore.

598
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:16,122
- Is everything okay on your ship?
- Why, yes, sir, yes, sir.

599
00:45:16,597 --> 00:45:19,896
Taxi over to the edge of the carrier's
wharf. They'll take care of you there.

600
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,229
Yes, sir.

601
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,679
They don't even wait until a fellow gets out.

602
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:42,017
- All Navy guys are cocky.
- Miller's a Navy guy.

603
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:45,081
Well, Miller isn't
exactly Navy. He's a pilot.

604
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,037
Hey, Spike.

605
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:07,341
- Spike.
- Spike, what's the matter?

606
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:09,439
Oh, I put in a beef about my fuel pump

607
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,245
and Doolittle told me to
take her to the hangar.

608
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:12,808
Well, then you're not going?

609
00:46:12,886 --> 00:46:14,877
No, and there's nothing
really wrong with that plane.

610
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:17,753
- It's the best ship in the squad.
- Boy, that's rough.

611
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:19,793
And I nearly told him about our interphone.

612
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,350
You would've been a cooked goose.

613
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:23,396
I think, sir, I'll go
and watch those Navy guys.

614
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:27,127
- They might bang her up or something.
- That's a good idea.

615
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:33,602
How do you like that?

616
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:42,675
They're going to break the Duck's back sure.

617
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:46,310
How did we get in the clutches
of these Navy guys anyhow?

618
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:57,221
- Boy, that's an awful big ship.
- Yeah, let's take a look at her.

619
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:00,166
- So long, Spike.
- So long, Spike.

620
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,964
- Be seeing you, Spike.
- Goodbye, fellows.

621
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:09,075
Lieutenant Lawson, reporting aboard, sir.

622
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:12,669
- Bettinger, take Lieutenant Lawson to...
- 306, sir.

623
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:14,576
- 306.
- This way, sir.

624
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:17,245
See you guys later.

625
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,711
Lieutenant McClure, reporting aboard, sir.

626
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,678
These are your quarters, sir.

627
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:56,689
Mr. White and Mr. Felton are on shore leave.

628
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:58,088
Thank you.

629
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,654
Are you sure you'll be able to find
your way back up to the deck, sir?

630
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:04,390
Oh, sure. Thanks.

631
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:08,488
What are you doing down here?

632
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:11,725
Oh, just looking around.
What are you doing here?

633
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:13,561
Just looking around.

634
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:19,263
- Are you lost too?
- Am I lost? I'm trapped like a rat.

635
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:21,500
I've been walking for miles.

636
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:24,569
This is the biggest
cockeyed ship I've ever seen.

637
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:26,613
Yeah. And I wish the deck was twice as big.

638
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,843
<i>The smoking lamp is out.
The smoking lamp is out.</i>

639
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:37,351
Sir, "The smoking lamp is out" means
no smoking anywhere on the ship.

640
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:38,982
- Okay.
- Why is that?

641
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,620
Because they're refueling, sir. They'll
let us know when they're through.

642
00:49:45,198 --> 00:49:46,222
Hello.

643
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:48,130
Well, you guys finally got on, huh?

644
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:50,499
Yeah, we've just been looking the tub over.

645
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,037
- How are your quarters?
- Perfect.

646
00:49:52,105 --> 00:49:53,834
Nice room with two bunks and a cot.

647
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:57,900
A cot? Follow me, brothers. I'm
gonna show you real quarters.

648
00:49:57,978 --> 00:49:59,741
And I mean quarters.

649
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:03,580
Hats. Hats.

650
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,716
- Well, look at what's here.
- Well, we have guests.

651
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,987
What's the idea of bringing people
up here from the tenement district?

652
00:50:14,628 --> 00:50:17,688
This is jocularly known
as the admiral's cabin.

653
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:20,124
Looks like you guys are going
to have to start bathing.

654
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,192
This isn't all. There's
something else. Follow me.

655
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,897
I'd be glad to.

656
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,500
Careful of the rugs, please.

657
00:50:31,044 --> 00:50:35,344
Now just inside, gentlemen, is something
to really feast your peepers on.

658
00:50:35,415 --> 00:50:39,146
The first guy turns in after
dinner gets this bed for the trip.

659
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:41,517
You know who that'll be. Enter.

660
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:49,924
What dirty, lowlife... Come
out of there, you boll weevil!

661
00:50:49,996 --> 00:50:52,829
Well, feed me corn and watch me grow.

662
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,965
How did all this scum get in?

663
00:50:55,068 --> 00:50:56,365
And me in an Army cot.

664
00:50:56,436 --> 00:50:58,996
That's where he'll end up,
before the night's over.

665
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:00,767
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, Lieutenant!

666
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:02,172
When you guys go down to dinner,

667
00:51:02,242 --> 00:51:04,608
would you mind bringing back
a roast beef sandwich, rare,

668
00:51:04,678 --> 00:51:07,579
and a piece of huckleberry pie, Lieutenant.

669
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:20,956
- Well, are you still glad you came along?
- Sure. Aren't you?

670
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:24,292
- I've got a funny feeling about this job.
- Yeah?

671
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,392
I think maybe it isn't going to be
as much of a cinch as we figured on.

672
00:51:28,468 --> 00:51:31,062
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.

673
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:33,971
Well, my ship's over there. I
think I'll go take a look at it.

674
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,530
Well, the Duck's up ahead.
I'll see you in the morning.

675
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:37,474
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

676
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:47,417
Who's that?

677
00:51:49,256 --> 00:51:50,985
- That you, Thatcher?
- Oh, yes, sir.

678
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:53,025
Oh, forget it, Thatcher.

679
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,255
Got her pretty well
lashed down, haven't they?

680
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:00,561
Yes, sir. They did a good job.

681
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,960
I was kind of worried about her,

682
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,164
so I thought I'd better
come up and have a look.

683
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:08,474
You lonesome?

684
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:11,642
I guess everybody is a little, sir.

685
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:15,340
Don't bother with the sirs,
Dave. Your quarters all right?

686
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:18,046
- Yeah. Fine.
- Grub's good, too, isn't it?

687
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:20,780
The best I've had in a long time, sir.

688
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:25,522
What are you going to do when
we get back home, Thatcher?

689
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:30,188
Oh, I have a girl in Billings, sir.
I'm going to marry her, if we get back.

690
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:32,658
Oh, we'll get back all right.

691
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:36,935
Oh, hello.

692
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:38,827
- Hello.
- Hello.

693
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:45,440
I thought I'd come up and shoot the stars for
a little while, but I guess it's too foggy.

694
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,571
Pretty foggy, all right.

695
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,957
- What are you guys doing here?
- Oh, just getting a little air.

696
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:04,455
- Yeah, it's pretty stuffy down below.
- Yeah, it sure is.

697
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:09,526
You guys worry over the ruptured
duck like a bunch of old maids.

698
00:53:09,636 --> 00:53:11,433
Me, I'm going to bed.

699
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,569
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

700
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,164
Goodnight, Ted.

701
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,643
Wonderful air, isn't it?

702
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:21,981
<i>The smoking lamp is lit.
The smoking lamp is lit.</i>

703
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:41,960
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Just battle stations.

704
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:44,697
Around sunup and sundown the pig
boats give us a little trouble

705
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:45,931
so we always lay for them.

706
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:47,598
This is Jig White and I'm Bud Felton.

707
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:49,733
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.

708
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,936
- How are you?
- See you later.

709
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,810
- Are we underway?
- For the last five hours.

710
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:57,111
Glad to have you aboard, Army.

711
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:59,582
<i>General Quarters, man your battle stations.</i>

712
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,985
<i>Army personnel, man your planes.</i>

713
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,681
Boy, the only way you're going to get
that thing off of here is with a crane.

714
00:54:29,749 --> 00:54:33,742
Maybe so. But we kind of think
we can take off on our own power.

715
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:36,214
Hey, where'd they come from?

716
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:39,149
That's what's known as an escort.

717
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:41,125
They just slipped up on us during the night.

718
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,458
The Navy likes to do things quietly.

719
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,556
Looks like it's really going
to be a show, doesn't it?

720
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,237
Boy, did I hate to part skin from
sheet this morning. What a bed.

721
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:54,333
Oh, this is Shorty Manch.
Jig White and Bud Felton.

722
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:55,772
- Hello.
- Hi y'all.

723
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:58,834
This lucky stiff is sleeping in
the bedroom off the admiral's cabin.

724
00:54:58,912 --> 00:55:02,404
Yeah. Wonderful accommodations,
but nothing much to do.

725
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:05,307
I thought there'd at least be a
poker game or something going on.

726
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,250
Oh, I guess they have
them every once in a while.

727
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,381
How about Seven-Toed Pete? Do you
ever play much of that around here?

728
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:12,789
What's Seven-Toed Pete?

729
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:15,919
Well, it's a kind of seven-card poker.

730
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:18,829
- I'd be glad to teach it to you some time.
- Never heard of it.

731
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,798
<i>Attention, Army personnel!</i>

732
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:24,325
<i>Attention, Army personnel!
Assemble in Ward Room.</i>

733
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,065
<i>- See you later, fellows.
- Assemble in Ward Room.</i>

734
00:55:26,139 --> 00:55:29,267
Well, it's been a great pleasure, fellows.
We'll certainly have to get together soon.

735
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:32,004
Maybe we can get up that
little game of poker.

736
00:55:32,779 --> 00:55:34,269
See you later.

737
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:40,345
You know, I believe that
boy wants to play poker.

738
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,878
I wonder if they got their
pay before they came aboard.

739
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,857
As you were.

740
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:54,490
For the benefit of those
who haven't already guessed,

741
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,797
we're going straight to Japan.

742
00:55:57,637 --> 00:56:01,471
The Navy will take us within 400
miles of the Japanese mainland.

743
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:04,772
We're going to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama,

744
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:09,046
Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya.

745
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:12,575
It'll be a night job and

746
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:16,452
you will be given the opportunity
of choosing the city you prefer.

747
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:21,324
Now, this is going to be a tight squeeze.

748
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:26,588
The Chinese have prepared small fields
just outside of Japanese occupied territory

749
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:28,691
for us to land on after the raid.

750
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:31,362
They'll gas us up and we'll
take off for Chungking.

751
00:56:31,438 --> 00:56:34,805
From now on we're in constant
danger of enemy attack.

752
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,733
If there should be a surface attack,

753
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,802
stand by your planes with fire extinguishers

754
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:41,972
and let the Navy handle it.

755
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:47,111
If there should be an attack by air,
take off and make for the nearest land.

756
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:51,688
The Navy will give all navigators
their bearings twice a day.

757
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:56,224
Now once more, I want to emphasize that if...

758
00:56:56,296 --> 00:57:01,256
If any of you feel you're not up to this job,
it's perfectly all right for you to drop out.

759
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:05,465
We have a few spare men and I
think we can fill your place.

760
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:11,309
Get together with Captain York and
find out what to do with your planes.

761
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:13,402
We'll meet here tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.

762
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,505
Are there any questions?

763
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:20,978
Colonel, do you mind if we
smoke during these assemblies?

764
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:28,861
I have no objection to that if
the Navy hasn't. Anything else?

765
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:30,156
Dismissed.

766
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:35,260
48, 49, 50.

767
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:39,169
51, 52, 53, 54,

768
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:42,970
55, 56... Oh, sorry, Manch.

769
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,170
- Just getting a little exercise.
- Yeah? Well, I wasn't.

770
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:48,874
I'm measuring off this cockeyed deck.

771
00:57:49,115 --> 00:57:50,139
Nine...

772
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:54,118
<i>Attention, all personnel. You have been
wondering about the mission we are on.</i>

773
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:55,313
<i>I think you might like to know</i>

774
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:58,755
<i>that the Army personnel on the
Hornet are going to bomb Japan.</i>

775
00:57:58,825 --> 00:58:02,386
<i>We of the Navy are going to take them
in as close to the enemy as possible.</i>

776
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:03,861
<i>This is a chance for all of us</i>

777
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,421
<i>to give the Japs a dose
of their own medicine.</i>

778
00:58:06,499 --> 00:58:08,399
<i>It's an Army-Navy show.</i>

779
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:11,536
<i>Let's extend every courtesy
to the Army men on the Hornet</i>

780
00:58:11,604 --> 00:58:13,731
<i>who are going to do the job.</i>

781
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:16,808
<i>Good luck, good hunting</i>

782
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,304
<i>and may God speed us on our mission.</i>

783
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,711
Have some?

784
00:58:22,515 --> 00:58:24,005
Thanks, buddy.

785
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:32,915
You're awfully lucky for guys who
never heard of Seven-Toed Pete.

786
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,590
They tell me Virginia's a
great hunting country, too.

787
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:39,894
What's that? Oh, yeah. Let's play, fellows.

788
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:42,264
- What's the bet?
- It's up to you, Manch.

789
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:44,565
Don't they call Virginia
the Mother of Presidents?

790
00:58:44,637 --> 00:58:47,105
Yeah. I mean... Bet five.

791
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:48,698
Up ten.

792
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,470
Thomas Jefferson lived there, too, didn't he?

793
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:51,601
I drop.

794
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:53,703
A lot of guys lived there.

795
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,806
Are you sure you never
played Seven-Toed Pete before?

796
00:58:56,883 --> 00:58:58,407
Makes it ten to you, Manch.

797
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:02,045
Have they finally gotten that hookworm
situation under control down there?

798
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,954
There never has been a case
of hookworm in Virginia.

799
00:59:05,024 --> 00:59:07,822
- I've got a small straight.
- Mine's seven to the jack.

800
00:59:07,894 --> 00:59:09,156
All pink.

801
00:59:09,662 --> 00:59:12,358
Well, that beats. I think I'll turn in.

802
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,558
- Somebody's won a lot of dough.
- A little.

803
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,795
- You just had a run of bad cards, Manch.
- Yeah.

804
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:18,302
What say we get together again pretty soon?

805
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:19,804
Oh, sure. See you later.

806
00:59:19,872 --> 00:59:23,603
Say, you haven't got any books
on Virginia, have you, Manch?

807
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:28,106
You Army guys are real pigeons.
I wish you were in the Navy.

808
00:59:30,116 --> 00:59:33,517
You take the bunk, Lawson. I'll
sleep here, if you don't mind.

809
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:36,612
- What's the idea?
- That thing's as soft as a feather bed.

810
00:59:36,689 --> 00:59:38,714
I never could sleep in it.

811
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:48,792
Yeah. It's not bad. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

812
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:53,304
Lieutenant Randall is going to tell
us something about a carrier takeoff.

813
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:54,772
Mr. Randall.

814
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:01,510
From the minute you're in your
planes, I'm the man to watch.

815
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:06,245
Have your engines turning over as soon
as the man in front of you starts taxiing.

816
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,311
When I want you to rev
up, I'll give you this.

817
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:11,783
Now, if your engines don't sound right to me,

818
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,986
I may have to keep you revved up
longer than you think necessary,

819
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:18,030
I can hear your engines and tell when
they're missing better than you can.

820
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:21,328
When I want you to start
taxiing, I'll give you this.

821
01:00:21,401 --> 01:00:24,996
Now you're in position.
I give you a final rev.

822
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:29,772
And when I drop it, you're off.

823
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:34,109
We'll aim you straight
for Japan. One more thing.

824
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,739
Once we're lined up for the takeoffs,

825
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:38,647
there can be no delays.

826
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,812
If your plane stalls, if it
doesn't start immediately,

827
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,048
if you have any trouble of any kind,

828
01:00:43,122 --> 01:00:45,488
we won't have time to do anything about it.

829
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,823
The Navy crew has orders
to push the ship overboard

830
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,125
and make way for the next one.

831
01:00:52,365 --> 01:00:55,061
Lieutenant Jurika has
detailed maps and pictures

832
01:00:55,134 --> 01:00:57,432
of cities and specified targets.

833
01:00:57,503 --> 01:01:00,438
Mr. Jurika spent a great many years in Japan.

834
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:03,471
I think it might be a good
idea if he gave you some idea

835
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:05,477
of what kind of people
you're going to run up against

836
01:01:05,545 --> 01:01:07,342
in case you're forced down.

837
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,379
Mr. Jurika.

838
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:15,786
I was Assistant Naval Attaché
at our embassy in Japan,

839
01:01:16,122 --> 01:01:19,421
long enough to learn a few
things about the Orient.

840
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,994
Just what should we do, Mr. Jurika?

841
01:01:23,062 --> 01:01:27,362
How should we conduct ourselves in
case we are forced down over Japan?

842
01:01:28,568 --> 01:01:32,163
My advice is, see that you're
not forced down over Japan.

843
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,937
The run I've got figured
out for you starts here.

844
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,044
The smokestacks are bright red
brick, and you can't miss them.

845
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,637
One of the largest smelters in Japan.

846
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:45,775
Then, following the line of the bay
and allowing 10 seconds between bombs

847
01:01:45,852 --> 01:01:48,412
you should take out this and this.

848
01:01:48,488 --> 01:01:50,888
Both of them are machine
shops owned by brothers,

849
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,415
I forget their names but I
remember I didn't like them.

850
01:01:55,461 --> 01:02:00,228
Then on out here to drop your incendiary.
How does this line up for you, Lawson?

851
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,199
Well, you're going to drop them, Clever.

852
01:02:02,268 --> 01:02:05,567
The run seems all right
for me if it's okay for you.

853
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:07,733
- We can take them out.
- Fine.

854
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,866
Jones, have you got the
course laid out for this run?

855
01:02:09,942 --> 01:02:11,933
Yes. Over here, fellows.

856
01:02:14,514 --> 01:02:17,415
Now you'll take off about
here. You go due west to Tokyo

857
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,475
at minimum cruising speed,
flying at about 50 feet.

858
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:22,748
When you hit the bay, get up to about 1,500

859
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,620
complete your bombing run,
then down again and out to sea,

860
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:29,354
- south by southeast to Yakushima.
- Can we take the maps with us?

861
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:30,760
All you need.

862
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,229
Be sure there are no marks on them though,

863
01:02:32,298 --> 01:02:33,856
which might show the Japs where you came from

864
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:35,833
in case you're captured.

865
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:39,065
By the way, I'm taking off
first with four incendiaries.

866
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:41,129
That should light up
Tokyo pretty well for you.

867
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:44,370
Suppose by the time we get to China, the
Japs have taken over the landing field?

868
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:47,038
The Chinese will arrange a signal
for you when you get to the field

869
01:02:47,113 --> 01:02:48,774
if the Japs have captured it.

870
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,011
If that's the case you've got to keep
right on going until you've run out of gas

871
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:54,780
then bail out and destroy your planes.

872
01:02:55,655 --> 01:02:56,713
Yes.

873
01:02:56,823 --> 01:02:58,313
There's just been a change in the disposition

874
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:00,882
of the barrage balloons over Tokyo.

875
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:02,890
This balloon and this one

876
01:03:02,962 --> 01:03:07,456
were moved this morning to here and here.

877
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:17,970
You know, the changes in
those balloons threw me.

878
01:03:18,978 --> 01:03:22,209
Just think, a bunch of guys
sweating all day in a sub

879
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:25,114
down under Tokyo bay, guys just like us

880
01:03:25,518 --> 01:03:28,612
sneaking up at night to
radio balloon positions.

881
01:03:29,021 --> 01:03:31,421
Just let me hear anybody
talk about the Navy again.

882
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:33,049
Boy, they're good.

883
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:36,652
Plenty. They're not bad at poker either.

884
01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:38,992
Oh, you're not kidding.

885
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,330
I kind of figured on getting Ellen
a present in Chungking, you know,

886
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,993
a kimono or something.

887
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,231
But these Navy guys have cleaned me.

888
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:49,172
Believe it or not, I've only got 14 bucks.

889
01:03:49,642 --> 01:03:51,405
Well, I got $8 or $10 I could let you have.

890
01:03:51,477 --> 01:03:53,911
Oh, no. No. I've been thinking,

891
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,710
cigarettes sell for 60 cents
a carton on the boat here.

892
01:03:56,782 --> 01:03:59,046
But in Chungking, I hear the
boys will pay seven bucks.

893
01:03:59,118 --> 01:04:00,118
Yeah?

894
01:04:00,186 --> 01:04:02,416
So I figure I may load
the duck with coffin nails.

895
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:04,251
Hey, that's an idea.

896
01:04:08,661 --> 01:04:11,129
- It's a good night for subs.
- Yeah.

897
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:14,556
You know, it's funny.

898
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:18,730
When I was a kid I used to dream
about going someplace on a ship.

899
01:04:19,906 --> 01:04:21,498
Well, here I am.

900
01:04:22,008 --> 01:04:23,908
And out there is Japan.

901
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:26,677
My mother had a Jap gardener once.

902
01:04:27,046 --> 01:04:29,446
He seemed like a nice little guy.

903
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,984
You know, I don't hate Japs, yet.

904
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:38,747
It's a funny thing. I don't
like them, but I don't hate them.

905
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:41,493
I guess I don't either.
You get kind of mixed up.

906
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:42,619
Yeah.

907
01:04:42,695 --> 01:04:45,789
It's hard to figure. Yet here we are.

908
01:04:45,865 --> 01:04:49,164
All I ever wanted to be was
an aeronautical engineer.

909
01:04:49,235 --> 01:04:52,170
I joined the Army in '40 because I
figured it was the best way to learn.

910
01:04:52,238 --> 01:04:54,934
I wasn't sore at anybody.

911
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:57,066
But here you suddenly
realize you're going to drop

912
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:00,306
a ton of high explosives on one
of the biggest cities in the world.

913
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:02,347
You're not getting squeamish, are you?

914
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:03,575
Oh, no, of course not.

915
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:07,141
I don't pretend to like the
idea of killing a bunch of people

916
01:05:07,219 --> 01:05:08,880
but it's the case of drop a bomb on them

917
01:05:08,955 --> 01:05:12,049
or pretty soon they'll
be dropping one on Ellen.

918
01:05:13,192 --> 01:05:14,921
Yeah, that's right.

919
01:05:15,561 --> 01:05:17,859
I wonder how many of us will pull through.

920
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:20,228
Oh, they figure about half.

921
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:23,459
- And everybody thinks he'll be in that half.
- Yeah.

922
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:28,200
- When are you going to get married, Bob?
- Oh, when I find somebody like Ellen.

923
01:05:28,274 --> 01:05:30,834
It'd be swell, you know. The four of us.

924
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,845
You know, when this is over I'd
like to get me a small ranch.

925
01:05:33,913 --> 01:05:37,212
Something that'd run about
40 or 50 head of cattle.

926
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:41,677
A nice well and a house.
It'd be wonderful for kids.

927
01:05:41,754 --> 01:05:44,348
I've always been kind of
nuts about ranches myself.

928
01:05:44,423 --> 01:05:45,913
You know, in a decent year
you can make real dough

929
01:05:45,992 --> 01:05:47,926
out of 40 head of cattle, if you've got feed.

930
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:51,353
- Why don't we do something like that?
- Well, I'm game if you are.

931
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,228
- Okay, it's a deal.
- Good.

932
01:05:56,135 --> 01:06:00,333
Of course, now if we had 80 head of
cattle we'd really have ourselves a layout.

933
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:03,341
- Yeah, and our own meat too.
- Oh, yeah, milk, butter, eggs,

934
01:06:03,409 --> 01:06:05,001
the whole works.

935
01:06:05,511 --> 01:06:06,603
You know, a guy who's got himself a place,

936
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:08,044
he doesn't have to worry about anything.

937
01:06:08,447 --> 01:06:12,110
- And with a little hunting near.
- Oh, sure, that's easy.

938
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:14,813
Gosh, I'll be glad when this war ends.

939
01:06:16,489 --> 01:06:19,219
In the event of an emergency
there will be no assembly.

940
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:23,557
No last minute instructions.
We'll just take off.

941
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:26,496
<i>If you should develop motor trouble within
a half hour after leaving the Hornet,</i>

942
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,726
fly back to the ship and land in the water.

943
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,536
The Navy will try to fish you out.

944
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:35,371
If trouble should develop after that
time, you'll have to keep right on going.

945
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:38,808
Because by that time the fleet will
have to fire on any craft overhead.

946
01:06:38,878 --> 01:06:41,870
I don't want you to throw out the
extra cans of gas as you use them.

947
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:44,882
<i>That would leave a perfect trail for
the Japs to follow back to the Hornet.</i>

948
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:48,147
Save the cans and throw
them all out at one time.

949
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:52,652
Now let me repeat something
I've said previously.

950
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:57,558
You are to bomb the military targets
assigned to you and nothing else.

951
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:04,194
Of course, in an operation of this
kind you cannot avoid killing civilians.

952
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:07,170
Because war plants are manned by civilians.

953
01:07:08,474 --> 01:07:11,637
If any of you have any moral
feelings about this necessary killing,

954
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:15,772
if you feel that you might think
of yourself afterward as a murderer,

955
01:07:15,848 --> 01:07:18,908
I want you to drop out. We'll
find someone to take your place.

956
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:21,919
And I promise you that no one
will blame you for your feelings.

957
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:27,118
Barring any sudden switch in plans,
we'll take off tomorrow night.

958
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,230
There's one thing more.

959
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:37,696
When we meet in Chungking
I'm going to throw you a party

960
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:40,671
that you can tell your grandchildren about.

961
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:50,545
You're a great bunch of guys. I'm
proud to be associated with you.

962
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:54,013
Good luck.

963
01:07:56,885 --> 01:07:59,080
- 12 cartons of cigarettes.
- 12 cartons?

964
01:07:59,154 --> 01:08:00,154
Say, what gives with the Army?

965
01:08:00,222 --> 01:08:02,019
I've never sold so many
cigarettes in my life.

966
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:04,992
- We're chain smokers.
- You must eat them. What kind will it be?

967
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:06,186
Oh, any kind.

968
01:08:06,261 --> 01:08:08,729
- You just want lots of cigarettes.
- You hit it right on the head.

969
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,162
All right.

970
01:08:13,435 --> 01:08:14,561
That'll be $7.20.

971
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:31,920
<i>Now hear this. Our carrier task force
has been sighted by enemy surface vessels.</i>

972
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:35,946
<i>All Army pilots and crews, man
your planes for immediate takeoff.</i>

973
01:08:36,425 --> 01:08:39,292
There goes a Jap just three
minutes after we sighted her.

974
01:08:39,361 --> 01:08:42,797
Yeah. That means she had two
minutes to tell Tokyo what she saw.

975
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:46,062
<i>Now hear this. Get all
bombs loaded on the double.</i>

976
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:48,729
- Are you all packed?
- Have been for five days, sir.

977
01:08:48,804 --> 01:08:50,829
Good. Better watch how
those guys handle the Duck.

978
01:08:50,906 --> 01:08:51,906
I will, sir.

979
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:53,464
And don't tell anybody
about that bumped turret.

980
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:55,009
I won't, sir.

981
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,110
- Hey, we're off, aren't we?
- Yeah!

982
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:01,843
Oh, bomb me, daddy!

983
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:05,519
I think I've got everything packed.

984
01:09:05,587 --> 01:09:06,747
- Swell, thanks.
- I'm sorry we couldn't have

985
01:09:06,822 --> 01:09:08,289
picked out a little better weather for you.

986
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,190
- We'll make it. So long, Felton.
- Give them a pasting they'll never forget.

987
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,127
We will. Look, thanks for everything.

988
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:17,962
You guys in the Navy, well,
you're okay. Be seeing you.

989
01:09:19,435 --> 01:09:23,201
<i>Now hear this. Clear the
flight deck to start engines.</i>

990
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:30,978
Hey, how about my change?

991
01:09:49,164 --> 01:09:51,792
They're giving us fifteen
extra cans instead of ten.

992
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:55,826
Good. At least getting off now
will put us over Tokyo in daylight.

993
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:57,895
Don't forget about the barrage
balloons in daylight too.

994
01:09:57,973 --> 01:09:59,270
Oh, next you'll be telling me it's good

995
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:00,808
because you can get better
pictures in the daytime.

996
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:04,642
- You're not kidding about that, either.
- Let's give her a final check.

997
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:11,544
Hey, Bob.

998
01:10:11,787 --> 01:10:14,153
- What?
- Are you up ahead?

999
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:15,383
Fourth spot.

1000
01:10:15,457 --> 01:10:16,890
See you in Chungking.

1001
01:10:17,025 --> 01:10:18,549
You said it, brother.

1002
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:35,171
- How they doing?
- Doolittle will be off any second.

1003
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:38,702
Then Hoover, Holstrom, Gray
and Davey Jones, we're seventh.

1004
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:39,906
Seven's a lucky number.

1005
01:10:39,982 --> 01:10:45,443
Ted, Ted. Hey, Ted, Ted, hey.
Put these some place, will you?

1006
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:47,250
- What are they?
- Sizzle platters.

1007
01:10:47,322 --> 01:10:50,223
I've got the phonograph in my ship.
But I haven't got room for the records.

1008
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:53,557
We'll meet in Chungking
and cut a Chinese rug.

1009
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:55,096
Okay, Shorty.

1010
01:10:57,466 --> 01:11:00,162
- Take care of these, will you, McClure?
- Right.

1011
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:04,169
<i>- Pilot to gunner.
- Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.</i>

1012
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,173
<i>Take a look at the turret
if you get a chance.</i>

1013
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:08,573
I've been working on that,
sir. She's still jammed.

1014
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:10,305
We'll use the auxiliary power if we have to.

1015
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:11,505
<i>Right, sir.</i>

1016
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,514
We've got ourselves in a
fine jam, haven't we, Lawson?

1017
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,608
Well, this is a great time to think of that.

1018
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:18,710
Oh, no, I mean having to
take off ahead of schedule.

1019
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:22,482
Oh, I'm sorry, Davenport. I
guess maybe I'm a little on edge.

1020
01:11:22,558 --> 01:11:25,391
- Bomb bay clear?
- Bomb bays clear.

1021
01:11:28,263 --> 01:11:30,629
- Clear on right?
- Clear on right.

1022
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:36,800
- Clear on left?
- Clear on left.

1023
01:12:37,165 --> 01:12:38,860
He made it. He made it.

1024
01:12:39,968 --> 01:12:41,367
Get your flaps up.

1025
01:12:59,954 --> 01:13:00,954
Hey!

1026
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:03,953
Good luck, fellows. Hand
them a couple for the Navy.

1027
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:06,084
- We sure will, Miller.
- And thanks to you.

1028
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,219
Wish I were going with you. So long.

1029
01:13:08,295 --> 01:13:09,295
- So long.
- So long.

1030
01:13:09,363 --> 01:13:10,625
Goodbye, boys.

1031
01:13:26,414 --> 01:13:28,575
- Four more ahead of us.
- Let's start the engines.

1032
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:29,673
Let's go.

1033
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:33,208
- Clear on right?
- Clear on right?

1034
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:34,584
Clear on right.

1035
01:13:41,262 --> 01:13:42,320
Clear on left?

1036
01:13:42,396 --> 01:13:43,658
Clear on left.

1037
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:12,618
Those Navy guys are
moving up to push us over.

1038
01:14:14,562 --> 01:14:17,053
They're not gonna toss this ship overboard.

1039
01:14:18,532 --> 01:14:20,363
Come on, baby. Give.

1040
01:14:23,771 --> 01:14:25,966
Give. Give.

1041
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:37,617
Check hydraulic pressure.

1042
01:14:37,685 --> 01:14:40,085
- Hydraulic pressure okay.
- Check brake pressure.

1043
01:14:40,154 --> 01:14:41,154
Okay.

1044
01:14:42,256 --> 01:14:43,587
There goes Bob.

1045
01:14:50,331 --> 01:14:51,855
Two more ahead of us.

1046
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:53,666
Check fuel booster.

1047
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:56,160
Hey, Army. Ted!

1048
01:14:57,071 --> 01:14:58,663
Give them for me.

1049
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:02,167
When we get to Chungking, we'll
tell them it was a Navy show too.

1050
01:15:02,243 --> 01:15:05,770
They'll know that when they see
how broke you are. Good hunting.

1051
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:20,726
<i>- Bomb bay doors closed.
- Bomb bays closed.</i>

1052
01:15:20,795 --> 01:15:23,889
<i>- Pilot to gunner. All set, Thatcher?
- Everything okay, sir.</i>

1053
01:15:23,964 --> 01:15:25,989
- Wing flaps down.
- Wing flaps coming down.

1054
01:15:26,066 --> 01:15:27,556
There goes Hallmark.

1055
01:15:45,486 --> 01:15:47,977
We're taking off, fellows. Happy landings.

1056
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,540
Phew!

1057
01:16:52,853 --> 01:16:53,853
Yeah.

1058
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:05,122
Both the flaps up.

1059
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:08,935
We didn't even have them down.

1060
01:17:09,236 --> 01:17:11,534
How do you like that? I
wonder what else we forgot.

1061
01:17:11,605 --> 01:17:13,903
Coffee, sandwiches, water, plenty.

1062
01:17:35,396 --> 01:17:38,331
Pilot to gunner. Thatcher.

1063
01:17:40,301 --> 01:17:42,269
Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.

1064
01:17:42,336 --> 01:17:45,305
<i>- You all right, Thatcher?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1065
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:46,737
You'd better get started on those cans.

1066
01:17:46,807 --> 01:17:49,674
<i>- We've burned over 40 gallons already.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1067
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,939
Well, we're on our way.

1068
01:17:55,015 --> 01:17:58,212
If anybody's carrying a rabbit's
foot, hang on to it tight.

1069
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:15,567
What's our position, McClure?

1070
01:18:15,903 --> 01:18:18,098
I figure about an hour and
58 minutes from the coast.

1071
01:18:18,172 --> 01:18:21,141
Get that, Thatcher? We can expect
their fighters any time now.

1072
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:23,403
- Keep your eyes open.
- Watching, sir.

1073
01:18:23,544 --> 01:18:26,570
There's nothing in sight. Could
we try out this turret again?

1074
01:18:26,647 --> 01:18:28,774
Okay. Relay switch on.

1075
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:37,114
It works all right, sir,

1076
01:18:37,191 --> 01:18:39,921
but that emergency power's not going
to hold out long if we run into trouble.

1077
01:18:39,994 --> 01:18:41,461
Turning it off now.

1078
01:18:42,963 --> 01:18:45,932
- How far are we behind our first gang?
- About an hour.

1079
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,365
Then we really can get set for trouble.

1080
01:18:47,434 --> 01:18:51,200
Yeah, but nothing like what the
guys behind us are going to run into.

1081
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:53,969
I'd feel a lot better on a night job.

1082
01:18:55,609 --> 01:18:57,770
Did you hear that left engine miss?

1083
01:18:58,345 --> 01:19:00,609
No, singing like a lark.

1084
01:19:02,182 --> 01:19:03,911
I must be hearing things.

1085
01:19:12,493 --> 01:19:14,051
Navigator to pilot.

1086
01:19:14,862 --> 01:19:16,352
<i>Pilot to Navigator. Go ahead.</i>

1087
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:19,058
We ought to hit the
Japanese coast any minute.

1088
01:19:28,909 --> 01:19:29,909
Look.

1089
01:19:35,883 --> 01:19:38,044
- See that flag?
- Yeah.

1090
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:43,078
- Saving bombs today.
- They're waving at us.

1091
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:45,249
Those guys must be nuts.

1092
01:19:50,998 --> 01:19:52,966
Japanese coast straight ahead.

1093
01:19:53,934 --> 01:19:54,934
Fujiyama.

1094
01:20:15,989 --> 01:20:18,583
We'll be catching buckshot any second now.

1095
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:17,410
Zeros.

1096
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:21,008
- Pilot to...
- I saw them, sir.

1097
01:22:21,081 --> 01:22:24,482
<i>- Shall I turn the power on for the turret?
- No, wait a minute.</i>

1098
01:22:35,996 --> 01:22:40,057
I don't know what happened to them,
sir. I guess they didn't see us.

1099
01:23:11,565 --> 01:23:13,362
There she is fellows. Take a good gander.

1100
01:23:13,433 --> 01:23:14,991
When we get back home, the
folks will want to know what

1101
01:23:15,068 --> 01:23:16,831
Tokyo used to look like.

1102
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,896
That must be Davey Jones
giving them the works.

1103
01:24:35,415 --> 01:24:38,282
Pilot to bombardier, bomb bay doors open.

1104
01:24:53,934 --> 01:24:57,301
- There we are, the big red smokestack.
- Pilot to bombardier,

1105
01:24:57,371 --> 01:24:59,635
<i>- approaching smelter.
- I'm on it.</i>

1106
01:25:02,008 --> 01:25:03,737
They've got our altitude.

1107
01:25:09,082 --> 01:25:10,276
One away.

1108
01:25:19,426 --> 01:25:20,791
Two away.

1109
01:25:31,872 --> 01:25:33,169
Three away.

1110
01:25:45,018 --> 01:25:46,508
Four away.

1111
01:26:09,142 --> 01:26:11,838
- Six fighters just above and to the right.
- Have you got them, Thatcher?

1112
01:26:11,912 --> 01:26:13,504
<i>Ready for them, sir.</i>

1113
01:26:21,388 --> 01:26:23,185
Why don't they dive?

1114
01:26:27,661 --> 01:26:29,128
They're going away.

1115
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:33,923
We're not going to wait for them to
come back. We're getting out of here.

1116
01:26:43,643 --> 01:26:47,135
Well, I guess maybe we're in that lucky half.

1117
01:26:47,547 --> 01:26:50,311
Not yet. Not till we get to China.

1118
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:03,352
Wow. What a headache.

1119
01:27:18,211 --> 01:27:20,839
- Were you scared?
- I'm still scared.

1120
01:27:21,181 --> 01:27:25,174
- McClure, on our course?
- On our course.

1121
01:27:33,793 --> 01:27:37,957
A hundred and sixty gallons. I hope
it's enough to get us to Changchow.

1122
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:40,928
Yeah, and I hope the Japs
don't get there first.

1123
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,013
What's the dope, McClure?

1124
01:28:02,856 --> 01:28:04,824
About 200 miles to Changchow.

1125
01:28:04,891 --> 01:28:09,828
<i>- And we ought to hit the coast any minute.
- We'll never find it in the dark.</i>

1126
01:28:11,331 --> 01:28:12,662
Pilot to crew.

1127
01:28:12,732 --> 01:28:16,964
We're going up and flying on instruments.
When the gas is gone we'll bail out.

1128
01:28:47,901 --> 01:28:52,736
We'll buzz it. Maybe we can land.
Keep a lookout for rocks or logs.

1129
01:29:09,923 --> 01:29:13,552
All set for landing.
McClure, get our guns out.

1130
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:18,222
Take off chutes and be sure your
life jackets are on. Carry your guns.

1131
01:29:18,298 --> 01:29:20,493
Wheels down. Flaps down.

1132
01:29:26,373 --> 01:29:28,534
Air speed 135.

1133
01:29:29,109 --> 01:29:30,201
130.

1134
01:29:31,878 --> 01:29:33,311
110.

1135
01:31:17,317 --> 01:31:19,308
I lost my ship.

1136
01:31:20,253 --> 01:31:23,347
I lost my ship.

1137
01:31:38,371 --> 01:31:42,398
- You hurt bad?
- I don't... I don't know.

1138
01:31:54,754 --> 01:31:56,949
I can't move my arms.

1139
01:32:23,616 --> 01:32:26,312
Your leg, it's all busted up, sir.

1140
01:32:26,386 --> 01:32:28,377
Get Davenport.

1141
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:26,440
<i>Ted, Ted, look at me.</i>

1142
01:33:26,846 --> 01:33:28,575
<i>That baby and I...</i>

1143
01:33:28,648 --> 01:33:30,639
<i>We won't ever need anything but you.</i>

1144
01:33:30,984 --> 01:33:34,249
We mustn't either of us
be scared about it, Ted,

1145
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:38,723
because the baby, the baby's why
I know you're coming back to us.

1146
01:33:48,768 --> 01:33:49,928
Lawson!

1147
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:14,650
Shall I shoot them, Lieutenant?

1148
01:34:25,505 --> 01:34:26,529
No, hold it.

1149
01:34:26,606 --> 01:34:29,097
- But they may be Japs, sir.
- Don't shoot, Thatcher.

1150
01:34:29,175 --> 01:34:31,166
Hey! Hey!

1151
01:34:57,070 --> 01:35:01,029
He says he's Chinese. What's
that word for American?

1152
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,227
That leg's got to be sewn up, sir.

1153
01:35:29,969 --> 01:35:31,459
It's split wide open.

1154
01:37:02,428 --> 01:37:04,191
Me, Charlie.

1155
01:37:05,198 --> 01:37:06,256
Americans.

1156
01:37:06,332 --> 01:37:08,630
- We're Americans.
- American.

1157
01:37:09,802 --> 01:37:10,894
Americans.

1158
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:15,334
We need a doctor, and some help

1159
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:18,141
to get to Changchow.

1160
01:37:19,112 --> 01:37:20,841
Chiang Kai-shek.

1161
01:37:21,747 --> 01:37:25,945
- We're his friends. In Chungking.
- Chungking!

1162
01:37:26,018 --> 01:37:27,178
- Yes.
- That's right.

1163
01:37:27,253 --> 01:37:28,845
We go Chungking.

1164
01:37:29,655 --> 01:37:34,319
Chungking many, many days. Many.

1165
01:37:34,727 --> 01:37:36,922
Doctor. Doctor.

1166
01:37:37,196 --> 01:37:41,792
Charlie, go, go doctor.
Charlie, bring doctor here.

1167
01:37:42,101 --> 01:37:44,626
Charlie, bring doctor or we die.

1168
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:47,431
Doctor, one li.

1169
01:37:47,673 --> 01:37:50,073
One li, that's a Chinese mile.

1170
01:37:50,877 --> 01:37:54,176
One li. Go.

1171
01:37:55,181 --> 01:37:56,808
Bring doctor.

1172
01:37:58,017 --> 01:38:03,512
Doctor, Japanese man. Japanese doctor.

1173
01:38:04,924 --> 01:38:08,485
Maybe Japanese man, Japanese soldier,

1174
01:38:09,562 --> 01:38:10,654
come here.

1175
01:38:11,564 --> 01:38:14,965
Japanese man no come at night.

1176
01:38:47,066 --> 01:38:49,728
Boat, you go boat.

1177
01:39:29,008 --> 01:39:30,339
Let's go.

1178
01:40:21,794 --> 01:40:23,159
Hey, cut that out.

1179
01:40:38,744 --> 01:40:41,713
I think he wants to trade
bullets with you, Thatcher.

1180
01:40:49,088 --> 01:40:50,088
Friend.

1181
01:40:51,357 --> 01:40:53,222
Charlie, friend.

1182
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:55,989
Charlie, go. Charlie, friend.

1183
01:40:56,062 --> 01:40:59,327
Sure, Charlie, friend. Goodbye, Charlie.

1184
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:19,210
The Japs must be all around us.

1185
01:41:19,952 --> 01:41:24,912
- I wonder where the rest of the gang is?
- Scattered all over the China coast,

1186
01:41:25,958 --> 01:41:27,550
if they're alive.

1187
01:41:38,037 --> 01:41:41,996
I think I'm going to pass out.

1188
01:41:43,309 --> 01:41:46,540
- I, Ted, take you, Ellen.
- To be my lawfully wedded wife.

1189
01:41:46,612 --> 01:41:48,136
To be my lawfully wedded wife.

1190
01:41:48,214 --> 01:41:51,615
- To have and to cherish.
- To have and to cherish.

1191
01:41:51,684 --> 01:41:54,152
Until death us do part.

1192
01:41:56,756 --> 01:41:58,621
Until death us do part.

1193
01:41:58,691 --> 01:42:00,556
<i>Until death us do part.</i>

1194
01:42:00,826 --> 01:42:02,657
<i>Until death us do part.</i>

1195
01:42:03,095 --> 01:42:06,326
Don't let them cut my leg off.
Please, don't let them cut my leg off.

1196
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:09,562
- Don't let them cut my leg off.
- Lawson, stop it. Lawson.

1197
01:42:10,569 --> 01:42:12,161
- Don't.
- Lawson.

1198
01:42:15,307 --> 01:42:17,741
- What's the matter?
- You were yelling.

1199
01:42:37,897 --> 01:42:39,228
Thank you.

1200
01:43:22,741 --> 01:43:24,641
My name is Foo Ling.

1201
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:27,771
Everything we have is yours.

1202
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:32,041
We know what you have done
and we honor you for it.

1203
01:43:32,585 --> 01:43:35,816
Our navigator has both his shoulders broken.

1204
01:43:36,722 --> 01:43:39,316
Is there anybody who can set them for him?

1205
01:43:40,025 --> 01:43:41,083
No one.

1206
01:43:41,727 --> 01:43:45,458
But we hope that help
will soon arrive for you.

1207
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:00,473
Thanks.

1208
01:44:12,124 --> 01:44:13,489
How are they?

1209
01:44:16,762 --> 01:44:19,560
We have washed them. They are bandaged.

1210
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,595
But we have no medicines.

1211
01:44:23,469 --> 01:44:25,027
Not even aspirin.

1212
01:44:27,606 --> 01:44:29,233
What's that?

1213
01:44:45,591 --> 01:44:47,786
- This is Dr. Chung.
- How do you do?

1214
01:44:48,861 --> 01:44:51,921
We've come a long way
and we're going home now

1215
01:44:52,498 --> 01:44:54,398
and we've been hunting a doctor everywhere.

1216
01:44:54,466 --> 01:44:55,763
I understand.

1217
01:44:56,468 --> 01:44:59,835
Have you got anything that'll knock
them out, Doctor? They're in awful pain.

1218
01:45:00,372 --> 01:45:03,773
We hope to have some medical supplies by
the time we reach my father's hospital.

1219
01:45:04,443 --> 01:45:06,240
Hospital? Where's that?

1220
01:45:06,545 --> 01:45:09,343
In Lin Hai. About 60 li from here.

1221
01:45:09,515 --> 01:45:13,144
- I have come to take you there.
- It's a funny thing, Doctor.

1222
01:45:13,752 --> 01:45:17,210
There were a lot of planes
and we had to take off early.

1223
01:45:17,856 --> 01:45:19,983
- You see how it was.
- Of course.

1224
01:45:20,059 --> 01:45:22,323
They aren't in any shape to
make much of a trip, Doctor.

1225
01:45:22,394 --> 01:45:23,759
We'll have to move them at once.

1226
01:45:23,829 --> 01:45:27,629
The Japanese captured one of your
crews yesterday, not very far from here.

1227
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:31,067
So many planes, and we don't
know what happened to the others.

1228
01:45:33,606 --> 01:45:35,665
All up and down the Chinese Coast.

1229
01:45:35,975 --> 01:45:38,535
My countrymen are seeking your countrymen.

1230
01:45:38,911 --> 01:45:40,606
We'll bring them through.

1231
01:45:50,055 --> 01:45:51,647
I have some money. I want to give it to you.

1232
01:45:51,757 --> 01:45:54,590
Please, Lieutenant, you
have given us enough already.

1233
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:57,561
- What?
- The bombs you dropped on Japan.

1234
01:45:57,963 --> 01:45:59,897
Please, now try to rest.

1235
01:46:30,029 --> 01:46:33,795
The Japanese, they are in
the village we just left.

1236
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:43,970
- Chan.
- Mr. Parker.

1237
01:46:44,376 --> 01:46:46,105
- Mrs. Parker.
- Doctor Chan.

1238
01:46:52,985 --> 01:46:55,180
- How are they?
- They are very, very sick.

1239
01:46:55,254 --> 01:46:57,347
- I'll need your help.
- How close are the Japanese?

1240
01:46:57,423 --> 01:46:59,891
They took Ching Ming three
hours after our departure.

1241
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:03,253
One of the American crews has
already fallen into their hands.

1242
01:47:03,662 --> 01:47:05,926
Hadn't they better be taken
straight through to Hop Sai?

1243
01:47:06,065 --> 01:47:07,965
They couldn't stand the trip.

1244
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,555
This is my father, Dr. Chung.

1245
01:47:38,731 --> 01:47:41,859
- The others, please, help them.
- Please, don't worry, Lieutenant.

1246
01:47:42,034 --> 01:47:43,934
We'll take care of everybody.

1247
01:47:54,413 --> 01:47:56,108
You won't have to take it off, will you, Doc?

1248
01:47:56,248 --> 01:47:58,375
We hope not. One cannot tell.

1249
01:47:58,784 --> 01:48:01,344
You've had a long journey. Now you must rest.

1250
01:48:02,321 --> 01:48:05,552
All we had at our Mission was a little
antiseptic fluid and some bandages.

1251
01:48:05,624 --> 01:48:07,717
But we've sent out runners for supplies.

1252
01:48:07,893 --> 01:48:09,884
Is there any way I could get a message out?

1253
01:48:09,962 --> 01:48:11,361
I'd like my mother to know that I'm okay.

1254
01:48:11,563 --> 01:48:13,656
The whole region's swarming with Japanese.

1255
01:48:13,732 --> 01:48:16,360
Well, do you think they've heard back
in the States what happened to us?

1256
01:48:16,435 --> 01:48:19,029
We've been listening in on short
wave. They know all about the raid,

1257
01:48:19,104 --> 01:48:20,731
but apparently they're
keeping the details secret

1258
01:48:20,806 --> 01:48:22,364
until the rest of your men have been saved.

1259
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:23,465
Have they found any of the others?

1260
01:48:23,542 --> 01:48:26,443
We have word that one crew will be
coming through here pretty soon now.

1261
01:48:26,512 --> 01:48:28,878
I understand there's a doctor among them.

1262
01:48:28,947 --> 01:48:31,780
Oh, that must be Lieutenant
Smith's crew. Excuse me.

1263
01:48:33,752 --> 01:48:36,380
Lieutenant Smith's crew
has been rescued, sir.

1264
01:48:36,688 --> 01:48:37,712
Smith's?

1265
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:41,385
They found Lieutenant Smith and
Doc White and they're coming here.

1266
01:48:41,593 --> 01:48:45,290
Don Smith's crew. The Doc
was flying with Don Smith.

1267
01:48:46,765 --> 01:48:48,756
They'll be here any minute now.

1268
01:48:51,370 --> 01:48:52,894
It's funny, isn't it?

1269
01:48:53,505 --> 01:48:57,771
I mean the way Clever's head
just keeps rocking back and forth,

1270
01:48:57,843 --> 01:48:59,140
back and forth.

1271
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:02,409
Somebody ought to help Clever.

1272
01:49:15,327 --> 01:49:17,090
I think the Chinese are
a swell bunch of people

1273
01:49:17,162 --> 01:49:18,686
but I can't say I go for their music.

1274
01:49:18,764 --> 01:49:21,358
Shorty Manch would go all to
pieces if he heard a little of this.

1275
01:49:21,433 --> 01:49:22,433
Yeah.

1276
01:49:23,936 --> 01:49:25,164
How's Lawson?

1277
01:49:25,871 --> 01:49:27,896
Well, his leg looks pretty bad, sir.

1278
01:49:28,006 --> 01:49:30,236
Dr. Chung thinks gangrene has set in.

1279
01:49:39,251 --> 01:49:41,185
Looks like a Jap Zero.

1280
01:50:06,078 --> 01:50:08,569
You guys ought to go on and leave me.

1281
01:50:09,615 --> 01:50:14,143
They think I'm passed out half
the time and I hear what they say.

1282
01:50:14,753 --> 01:50:17,984
The Japs are coming closer all
the time. Why don't you guys go?

1283
01:50:18,223 --> 01:50:20,453
We're not sticking around
here because of you, Lawson.

1284
01:50:20,726 --> 01:50:23,718
- None of us here are able to travel yet.
- I was just thinking.

1285
01:50:24,029 --> 01:50:26,998
I guess Ellen and I aren't
going to ski anymore.

1286
01:50:28,267 --> 01:50:29,996
That's too bad.

1287
01:50:31,136 --> 01:50:33,661
I was going to teach her some fancy stuff.

1288
01:50:34,072 --> 01:50:36,597
Now don't start talking like that.
You're going to pull through all right.

1289
01:50:36,675 --> 01:50:41,408
What do you think a girl would do?
I mean, say Ellen and I like to ski.

1290
01:50:43,115 --> 01:50:46,084
Be kind of funny if they
cut my leg off, wouldn't it?

1291
01:50:46,718 --> 01:50:47,946
Why don't you try to go to sleep?

1292
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:50,580
Yeah, it'd be kind of funny, all right.

1293
01:50:50,656 --> 01:50:53,887
You marry a guy, he's
got two arms and two legs.

1294
01:50:54,893 --> 01:50:58,158
Then he comes back and he hasn't any.

1295
01:51:07,272 --> 01:51:09,069
- I am Dr. Chung.
- Where are the boys?

1296
01:51:09,141 --> 01:51:10,301
How are you, Pop?

1297
01:51:12,110 --> 01:51:13,975
Did you have a good trip?

1298
01:51:15,047 --> 01:51:18,278
- Here they are.
- Hi, fellas.

1299
01:51:18,350 --> 01:51:20,079
- How are you?
- How you doing?

1300
01:51:20,152 --> 01:51:21,983
- Hello, Sarge.
- It's good to see you.

1301
01:51:22,054 --> 01:51:25,023
- Holy Joe, what happened to you guys?
- Nothing serious.

1302
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:26,216
The Duck forgot to duck.

1303
01:51:26,291 --> 01:51:29,089
Yeah, McClure's been trying to
do his own flying ever since.

1304
01:51:29,161 --> 01:51:31,721
This really looks like something
left over from a massacre.

1305
01:51:31,797 --> 01:51:33,628
Well, you guys don't look so good yourselves.

1306
01:51:33,699 --> 01:51:34,996
You don't smell so good either.

1307
01:51:35,067 --> 01:51:37,831
Well, there's nothing wrong with
us that a good bath won't fix.

1308
01:51:37,903 --> 01:51:40,963
- I wish we could say the same for you.
- How's the grub around here?

1309
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:44,770
I think I'd like a good thick
steak, French fried onions

1310
01:51:44,843 --> 01:51:47,437
and a baked potato with plenty of butter

1311
01:51:47,512 --> 01:51:49,707
and about three bottles of beer...

1312
01:51:50,115 --> 01:51:52,413
You'll take bean sprouts and like them.

1313
01:51:53,151 --> 01:51:55,881
- Say, where's Lawson and Davenport?
- They're upstairs.

1314
01:51:56,054 --> 01:51:58,989
- Lawson's in pretty bad shape.
- You better go up and see him.

1315
01:51:59,224 --> 01:52:00,748
He needs you bad, Doc.

1316
01:52:01,693 --> 01:52:04,560
Well, it's certainly good
to see you fellows again.

1317
01:52:04,963 --> 01:52:07,989
Hey, Pop, how's the chop suey around here?

1318
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:13,370
He doesn't speak English.

1319
01:52:14,473 --> 01:52:16,100
I'm sorry, Pop.

1320
01:52:22,247 --> 01:52:26,877
Yeah, and when Shorty jumped,
he had two. 45s, a. 44 rifle,

1321
01:52:26,952 --> 01:52:31,082
a. 22 automatic, that Luger of
his, a hunting knife, a Bowie knife

1322
01:52:31,156 --> 01:52:33,351
- and an ax.
- What a guy.

1323
01:52:34,259 --> 01:52:38,355
He stuffed his shirt full of chocolate
bars but he forgot to button his collar.

1324
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:40,088
So when he pulled the rip cord,

1325
01:52:40,165 --> 01:52:43,828
he just naturally molted
candy all over North China.

1326
01:52:43,902 --> 01:52:47,201
- What happened to his photograph?
- It went down with the ship.

1327
01:52:47,372 --> 01:52:50,466
Next morning Manch scared the
Chinese right out of their wits.

1328
01:52:50,542 --> 01:52:52,942
They didn't know anything
human grew that tall.

1329
01:52:53,278 --> 01:52:54,609
What about Bob Gray?

1330
01:52:54,679 --> 01:52:58,080
He's okay. I think they
moved on to Chungking.

1331
01:52:59,785 --> 01:53:03,721
Oh, yeah, and that guy "Me,
Charlie" said to tell you hello.

1332
01:53:04,956 --> 01:53:08,323
If it hadn't been for Charlie, the
Japs would have had us that first day.

1333
01:53:08,493 --> 01:53:10,222
Yeah, us too.

1334
01:53:10,829 --> 01:53:14,094
I'd like to come back some day
and fight alongside that guy.

1335
01:53:14,166 --> 01:53:15,292
Me, too.

1336
01:53:15,667 --> 01:53:17,134
Well, it's all over.

1337
01:53:17,335 --> 01:53:19,496
Let's save some of this talk for tomorrow.

1338
01:53:20,205 --> 01:53:22,298
A pint and a half, that's not bad.

1339
01:53:23,141 --> 01:53:24,335
You'd better get to bed now.

1340
01:53:24,609 --> 01:53:26,600
You're an old grandma, Doc.

1341
01:53:29,848 --> 01:53:32,681
But I'll take it slow,
just as a favor to you.

1342
01:53:33,251 --> 01:53:34,843
Be seeing you, Lawson.

1343
01:53:35,554 --> 01:53:36,748
Thanks, Doc.

1344
01:53:39,191 --> 01:53:40,658
How's the leg, Doc?

1345
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:43,252
It's not good, Lawson.

1346
01:53:44,062 --> 01:53:46,758
The next forty-eight
hours will tell the story.

1347
01:53:48,066 --> 01:53:49,066
Well, thank you.

1348
01:53:49,134 --> 01:53:50,465
- Hey, Don.
- Yeah?

1349
01:53:50,535 --> 01:53:52,765
Tell Doolittle to hold off
that party till we get there.

1350
01:53:52,838 --> 01:53:55,102
Okay, Davenport. We'll wait for you.

1351
01:53:55,173 --> 01:53:58,267
- Where's Thatcher?
- He's in with Lawson. He'll be right out.

1352
01:53:58,343 --> 01:53:59,537
Okay.

1353
01:54:00,045 --> 01:54:03,572
I wish you would let me stay here
until you're ready to go, sir.

1354
01:54:03,949 --> 01:54:05,416
These people will take care of us.

1355
01:54:05,484 --> 01:54:09,818
There's no reason for you fellows
to hang around and maybe get caught.

1356
01:54:10,222 --> 01:54:13,555
Yeah, I know, but I might come
in handy if the Japs show up, sir.

1357
01:54:16,027 --> 01:54:18,587
Thatcher, when you get back to the States,

1358
01:54:18,663 --> 01:54:20,187
if you should run into my wife,

1359
01:54:21,566 --> 01:54:23,158
just tell her I'm okay.

1360
01:54:24,136 --> 01:54:27,435
Don't let her know about
anything being wrong.

1361
01:54:28,306 --> 01:54:29,864
I understand, sir.

1362
01:54:33,945 --> 01:54:36,573
And say hello for me to
that girl in Billings.

1363
01:54:37,249 --> 01:54:38,614
That I will, sir.

1364
01:54:40,018 --> 01:54:42,680
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Thatcher.

1365
01:55:10,448 --> 01:55:11,608
Good morning.

1366
01:55:12,450 --> 01:55:15,078
- Good morning, Lawson.
- Hi, Doc.

1367
01:55:17,856 --> 01:55:20,416
I'll try not to hurt you,
Lawson. I'll have a look at this.

1368
01:55:29,668 --> 01:55:30,726
Thanks.

1369
01:55:42,881 --> 01:55:44,872
You going to take the leg, Doc?

1370
01:55:45,584 --> 01:55:47,142
Yeah, I think so.

1371
01:55:47,686 --> 01:55:50,519
We talked it over and
there's nothing else to do.

1372
01:55:53,191 --> 01:55:55,625
It's pretty rough to have
to cut a man's leg off.

1373
01:55:55,794 --> 01:55:58,092
I guess it'll be all right.

1374
01:55:58,897 --> 01:56:03,596
After all, a wooden leg is just kind of
like wearing a shoe with a high instep.

1375
01:56:05,770 --> 01:56:07,294
When are you gonna do it?

1376
01:56:07,872 --> 01:56:09,931
I might as well give you a shot right now.

1377
01:56:10,108 --> 01:56:11,575
You mean we have something to knock me out?

1378
01:56:11,643 --> 01:56:14,441
Our runners arrived with
anesthetic this morning.

1379
01:56:14,646 --> 01:56:16,580
It'll only be a spinal, Lawson.

1380
01:56:16,815 --> 01:56:19,716
You won't feel anything from the
waist down, but you'll be conscious.

1381
01:56:19,784 --> 01:56:21,342
That's the best we can do.

1382
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,153
Oh, swell.

1383
01:56:24,923 --> 01:56:28,154
I can watch you and make sure
you don't take off too much.

1384
01:56:29,694 --> 01:56:32,390
All right, Lawson. We'll
have to roll you over.

1385
01:56:46,077 --> 01:56:47,567
It'll take a little time to work.

1386
01:56:47,646 --> 01:56:50,046
We'll get you over to the operating room.

1387
01:57:01,926 --> 01:57:03,450
- Doc?
- Yes?

1388
01:57:03,695 --> 01:57:06,323
- How high are you going to cut?
- Oh, not too high.

1389
01:57:06,398 --> 01:57:09,196
- Will I have a knee, Doc?
- I'm afraid not, Lawson.

1390
01:57:09,701 --> 01:57:12,829
- Any feeling there?
- No. Look, Doc.

1391
01:57:12,904 --> 01:57:15,202
We can't waste any time, Lawson.
When that anesthetic wears off,

1392
01:57:15,273 --> 01:57:17,332
- we haven't got any more.
- Okay, but just one thing more.

1393
01:57:17,409 --> 01:57:18,409
Yes.

1394
01:57:18,476 --> 01:57:19,875
If anything happens,

1395
01:57:19,944 --> 01:57:22,640
don't let Ellen know
anything about the operation.

1396
01:57:23,348 --> 01:57:26,943
She might just as well think
I died while all in one piece.

1397
01:57:27,352 --> 01:57:29,912
All right, Lawson. Now,
you're not going to feel this.

1398
01:57:29,988 --> 01:57:31,455
But you might get nervous
and jump or something,

1399
01:57:31,523 --> 01:57:33,252
so the nurses are going to hold you.

1400
01:57:33,658 --> 01:57:34,658
Okay, Doc.

1401
01:57:35,427 --> 01:57:36,655
Fire away.

1402
01:57:45,870 --> 01:57:49,499
Oh, when you said "no
knee," you weren't kidding.

1403
01:57:50,508 --> 01:57:52,032
If I cut any lower we
might have to do it again

1404
01:57:52,110 --> 01:57:54,203
and your system couldn't take it.

1405
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:00,845
What're you stalling for, Doc?

1406
01:58:00,919 --> 01:58:02,944
We're doing the best we
can, Lawson. Take it easy.

1407
01:58:03,021 --> 01:58:04,750
Okay. Only hurry.

1408
01:58:04,823 --> 01:58:07,348
It seems like I'm beginning
to feel my other leg.

1409
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,798
It seems like I can move my toes, Doc.

1410
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:26,568
I think I can move my ankle.
Hurry, Doc, I'm sure I can.

1411
01:58:29,047 --> 01:58:31,345
Hurry, Doc, hurry.

1412
01:58:42,227 --> 01:58:44,218
<i>- Hello.
- Hello. Hello, Ellen?</i>

1413
01:58:44,295 --> 01:58:46,525
<i>- Ted, where are you?
- I'm in a lumber camp.</i>

1414
01:58:46,598 --> 01:58:49,192
I had to make a forced
landing in a mud puddle.

1415
01:58:49,267 --> 01:58:51,861
<i>- You aren't hurt, are you?
- No, not a scratch.</i>

1416
01:58:52,036 --> 01:58:56,370
<i>- Have you got the tree all fixed?
- Oh, yes, Ted. You should just see it.</i>

1417
01:58:56,741 --> 01:58:59,141
<i>- It's so beautiful.
- Anything under it?</i>

1418
01:58:59,210 --> 01:59:02,441
<i>- Oh, yes.
- Well, let's open them up.</i>

1419
01:59:02,514 --> 01:59:06,507
- Oh, we can't do that.
- Sure we can. Go ahead.

1420
01:59:06,718 --> 01:59:08,743
<i>Well, if you say so.</i>

1421
01:59:09,053 --> 01:59:12,819
I'm not going to be cheated out of
my Christmas by a cracked up airplane.

1422
01:59:12,891 --> 01:59:14,859
<i>Oh, Ted, it's the most beautiful</i>

1423
01:59:14,926 --> 01:59:17,588
<i>box of candy I've ever seen in my whole life.</i>

1424
01:59:17,762 --> 01:59:21,459
Good. Isn't there maybe
something else lying around?

1425
01:59:22,033 --> 01:59:26,129
<i>- Let me see. Yes, there is.
- Well, open it.</i>

1426
01:59:26,671 --> 01:59:30,835
It's a silk scarf. And it
looks like it's handmade, too.

1427
01:59:31,709 --> 01:59:34,678
<i>- I'll bet it's got my initials on it.
- That's not fair.</i>

1428
01:59:34,746 --> 01:59:37,340
You peeked while I was making it.

1429
01:59:37,649 --> 01:59:38,980
I just know my wife.

1430
01:59:39,050 --> 01:59:42,850
<i>- Oh, Ted, I wish you were here.
- So do I, honey.</i>

1431
01:59:43,321 --> 01:59:45,414
<i>I'll be thinking of you tonight.</i>

1432
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:49,290
<i>I'll sit in front of the tree and
turn the radio on to Christmas carols</i>

1433
01:59:49,861 --> 01:59:51,795
<i>and just think of you.</i>

1434
02:01:16,381 --> 02:01:19,817
Thank you. And thank you, scouts.

1435
02:01:21,452 --> 02:01:24,683
I mean, all the fellows would
like to thank you very much,

1436
02:01:25,557 --> 02:01:27,149
for everything.

1437
02:01:40,605 --> 02:01:44,735
Lieutenant, my father has
asked me to present this to you.

1438
02:01:44,976 --> 02:01:48,139
It has been in our family
since the fifteenth century.

1439
02:01:49,147 --> 02:01:52,742
Father begs me to tell you
that beauty belongs to beauty,

1440
02:01:53,117 --> 02:01:56,416
and asks that you honor him
by presenting it to your wife.

1441
02:02:01,192 --> 02:02:03,490
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1442
02:02:04,729 --> 02:02:08,187
I didn't know that you
knew about Ellen, my wife.

1443
02:02:08,833 --> 02:02:11,666
You spoke of her a number of times.

1444
02:02:15,406 --> 02:02:19,706
It says, "This is an American
hero who has bombed Japan.

1445
02:02:20,211 --> 02:02:22,941
"Whenever he goes among the people of China,

1446
02:02:23,214 --> 02:02:26,206
"let him be accorded respect and honor. "

1447
02:02:35,293 --> 02:02:36,851
He has just come from Kow Chai.

1448
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:38,725
Another one of your crews has been captured

1449
02:02:38,796 --> 02:02:40,855
and the Japanese are
moving in this direction.

1450
02:02:40,932 --> 02:02:43,059
I think Lawson will be able
to travel in a couple of days.

1451
02:02:43,134 --> 02:02:45,602
There's nothing wrong with me,
Doc. I can travel right now.

1452
02:02:45,670 --> 02:02:48,230
I'm afraid a couple of days will be too long.

1453
02:02:55,013 --> 02:02:56,537
This is Wang Tsung.

1454
02:02:56,614 --> 02:02:59,481
He has walked all the way from
his native village of Kow Chai.

1455
02:02:59,550 --> 02:03:03,111
And he begs the honor of presenting
gifts to his American Allies.

1456
02:03:07,425 --> 02:03:08,551
Thank you.

1457
02:03:10,662 --> 02:03:11,754
Thank you.

1458
02:03:17,635 --> 02:03:18,635
Thanks.

1459
02:03:24,409 --> 02:03:25,933
Thank you very much.

1460
02:03:29,313 --> 02:03:30,405
Thank you.

1461
02:03:51,035 --> 02:03:54,198
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1462
02:04:05,850 --> 02:04:08,080
He felt a lot worse than I did.

1463
02:04:36,547 --> 02:04:37,980
There, I can get along pretty well already.

1464
02:04:38,049 --> 02:04:41,018
I should say very well for
your first day out of bed.

1465
02:04:48,659 --> 02:04:51,184
I guess, I'll have to
be a little more careful.

1466
02:04:51,262 --> 02:04:53,787
I don't ever want anybody to see me do that.

1467
02:04:55,366 --> 02:04:58,733
I don't want anybody to
see me till I get a new leg.

1468
02:05:01,372 --> 02:05:03,636
Lieutenant White, word just came.

1469
02:05:03,708 --> 02:05:06,768
The American plane will pick you up in
Changchow tomorrow afternoon at 5:00.

1470
02:05:06,844 --> 02:05:08,072
Wonderful.

1471
02:05:12,016 --> 02:05:15,213
He says if we don't hurry, the
Japanese may get there first.

1472
02:05:15,286 --> 02:05:16,913
- When are you leaving?
- We're going to stay here.

1473
02:05:16,988 --> 02:05:18,114
We're quite used to it, you know.

1474
02:05:18,189 --> 02:05:20,020
- Here. This may come in handy.
- Thank you.

1475
02:05:20,091 --> 02:05:21,956
You and Mr. Parker have done so much for us,

1476
02:05:22,026 --> 02:05:23,026
and we'll never forget it.

1477
02:05:23,094 --> 02:05:24,118
- Goodbye, Lawson.
- Goodbye.

1478
02:05:24,195 --> 02:05:25,321
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

1479
02:05:25,396 --> 02:05:28,024
- Goodbye. God bless you.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

1480
02:05:28,766 --> 02:05:31,894
My father wishes me to tell you that
you have honored us with your visit

1481
02:05:31,969 --> 02:05:34,733
and that he will offer prayers
for your safe return to America.

1482
02:05:34,806 --> 02:05:36,330
Isn't he coming along with us?

1483
02:05:36,407 --> 02:05:38,432
Father feels that he
must stay with his people.

1484
02:05:38,509 --> 02:05:40,033
They will need him here.

1485
02:05:41,946 --> 02:05:43,072
Goodbye, sir.

1486
02:06:17,348 --> 02:06:19,316
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Goodbye, sir.

1487
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:23,850
- Goodbye, Doc, and thanks for everything.
- I hope, sir, that we may meet again.

1488
02:06:23,921 --> 02:06:25,115
That goes double, Doc.

1489
02:06:25,189 --> 02:06:27,054
Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you.

1490
02:06:27,124 --> 02:06:28,182
Thank you.

1491
02:06:28,259 --> 02:06:30,284
If you ever come to the States,
Doctor, look me up, will you?

1492
02:06:30,361 --> 02:06:32,261
I'll be in the Portland telephone directory.

1493
02:06:32,363 --> 02:06:35,093
- With pleasure.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

1494
02:06:36,634 --> 02:06:38,329
I have one sorrow, Lieutenant,

1495
02:06:38,402 --> 02:06:41,530
that we did not have the
medicine to ease your pain.

1496
02:06:42,039 --> 02:06:46,169
- You saved my life, Doc.
- I hope someday you will come back to us.

1497
02:06:46,244 --> 02:06:48,678
We'll be back, maybe not us ourselves

1498
02:06:48,746 --> 02:06:51,579
but a lot of guys like us.
And I'd like to be with them.

1499
02:06:52,116 --> 02:06:56,849
- Because you're our kind of people.
- Thank you, sir, and goodbye.

1500
02:07:55,646 --> 02:07:58,774
- Hello.
- Hello.

1501
02:07:59,583 --> 02:08:03,019
- Go ahead, sit down.
- Thank you.

1502
02:08:15,833 --> 02:08:18,768
I know how you feel. Take it for a while.

1503
02:08:21,138 --> 02:08:22,264
Thanks.

1504
02:08:40,758 --> 02:08:41,884
Smell that?

1505
02:08:44,595 --> 02:08:47,257
That's America. That's the USA.

1506
02:08:49,367 --> 02:08:52,734
Every time I make a trip back,
she smells better and better.

1507
02:08:52,970 --> 02:08:53,970
Yeah.

1508
02:08:55,306 --> 02:08:57,740
- I think I know what you mean.
- I'm from Pittsburgh.

1509
02:08:57,808 --> 02:09:00,208
I know it may seem screwy to you, but

1510
02:09:00,811 --> 02:09:03,279
it seems to me as if I can
smell some of that coal smoke

1511
02:09:03,347 --> 02:09:06,783
right off the old Monongahela
River. That sound crazy?

1512
02:09:06,851 --> 02:09:10,184
No. I'm from California and
I can smell orange blossoms.

1513
02:09:10,254 --> 02:09:13,087
Oh, it couldn't be, that's too
far. It must come from Florida.

1514
02:09:13,157 --> 02:09:15,751
Oh, if you want flavor, you've
got to have a California orange,

1515
02:09:15,826 --> 02:09:19,990
but for smelling, Florida's just as good.

1516
02:09:38,783 --> 02:09:41,308
Hello. Yes.

1517
02:09:43,254 --> 02:09:44,414
What's that?

1518
02:09:46,891 --> 02:09:48,984
- Just a minute. Ellen.
- Yes?

1519
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:51,187
Ellen, Washington on the phone.

1520
02:09:57,334 --> 02:09:58,334
Hello?

1521
02:09:59,437 --> 02:10:01,405
Yes, this is Mrs. Lawson.

1522
02:10:02,606 --> 02:10:05,837
Hello, Colonel. I mean General Doolittle.

1523
02:10:06,610 --> 02:10:08,407
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you.

1524
02:10:09,213 --> 02:10:11,340
No, not a bit excited, General.

1525
02:10:11,816 --> 02:10:15,809
Oh, he's back, Mother. Ted's back. He's back.

1526
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:19,080
Oh yes, General, how is he?

1527
02:10:24,195 --> 02:10:25,195
Oh, yes.

1528
02:10:26,797 --> 02:10:28,264
I understand.

1529
02:10:29,934 --> 02:10:31,333
Of course, I do.

1530
02:10:34,271 --> 02:10:36,296
Yes, I'll be ready.

1531
02:10:37,741 --> 02:10:39,732
I know, I know.

1532
02:10:41,579 --> 02:10:43,774
Oh, that's so nice of you, General.

1533
02:10:44,715 --> 02:10:48,742
Yes, thank you. Oh, yes, thank you, General.

1534
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:50,512
Thank you.

1535
02:11:03,534 --> 02:11:05,229
Just cry, darling.

1536
02:11:06,504 --> 02:11:07,801
Cry it out.

1537
02:11:09,607 --> 02:11:11,598
He got in this morning, Mother.

1538
02:11:11,709 --> 02:11:14,644
General Doolittle just saw him, so it's true.

1539
02:11:15,212 --> 02:11:18,045
General Doolittle's sending
a plane ticket for me.

1540
02:11:18,449 --> 02:11:20,212
Ted doesn't want to see me.

1541
02:11:20,284 --> 02:11:23,048
He doesn't want to see me
because he's lost his leg

1542
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:25,680
and he doesn't even want
me to know it's happened

1543
02:11:25,756 --> 02:11:28,884
till he gets a new leg
and learns how to use it.

1544
02:11:29,393 --> 02:11:31,520
As if it would make any difference.

1545
02:11:31,595 --> 02:11:36,089
As if anything would make any
difference to me as long as he's alive.

1546
02:11:36,167 --> 02:11:39,762
Oh, I'm going to see
him, I'm going to see him.

1547
02:11:48,012 --> 02:11:49,012
Well,

1548
02:11:50,514 --> 02:11:53,642
that means we have to get
your clothes ready in a hurry.

1549
02:11:59,890 --> 02:12:02,120
Have my things come back
from the cleaners yet?

1550
02:12:02,193 --> 02:12:03,524
Let's see, I'll take this suit.

1551
02:12:03,594 --> 02:12:06,825
And my blue coat. He always liked it best.

1552
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:12,631
I can't take any of these things. I
can't take any of my pretty clothes.

1553
02:12:12,703 --> 02:12:14,671
They don't fit me anymore.

1554
02:12:14,738 --> 02:12:16,205
Do you think Ted's going to pay any attention

1555
02:12:16,273 --> 02:12:18,366
to what kind of clothes
you wear or how you look?

1556
02:12:18,442 --> 02:12:19,807
He always did.

1557
02:12:20,611 --> 02:12:22,511
Oh, Mother, I'm scared.

1558
02:12:22,846 --> 02:12:25,007
There's nothing to be frightened about.

1559
02:12:25,182 --> 02:12:27,275
Lots of people lose a leg or arm

1560
02:12:27,351 --> 02:12:30,377
- and continue living perfectly normal lives.
- I'm not scared about Ted.

1561
02:12:30,487 --> 02:12:33,251
- I'm scared about me.
- About you?

1562
02:12:33,591 --> 02:12:38,585
Well, you see, most husbands and wives
are together while things are changing.

1563
02:12:38,796 --> 02:12:42,527
Husbands get used to things like
that because, well, they're around.

1564
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:46,358
Ted's been gone all this time and
when he went away, I was so slim.

1565
02:12:46,837 --> 02:12:50,534
All the time he's been gone, he's
been thinking of me like that.

1566
02:12:51,175 --> 02:12:53,803
Ted loves you Ellen, and you love him.

1567
02:12:54,478 --> 02:12:57,572
That's why neither of you is going
to notice any change when you meet.

1568
02:12:57,748 --> 02:13:01,343
- Do you think so, Mother?
- I know so.

1569
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:13,496
All the same, if I held my coat like this

1570
02:13:13,564 --> 02:13:17,056
when I walk into the room,
don't you think it would hide me,

1571
02:13:17,134 --> 02:13:18,396
just a little?

1572
02:13:28,178 --> 02:13:31,204
Hello, Lawson. How're you feeling?

1573
02:13:31,382 --> 02:13:33,213
- Pretty good, sir.
- You look fine.

1574
02:13:33,284 --> 02:13:34,581
Thank you, sir.

1575
02:13:35,019 --> 02:13:37,385
- Won't you sit down, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.

1576
02:13:38,122 --> 02:13:41,888
- Well, got any plans?
- About what, sir?

1577
02:13:41,959 --> 02:13:44,587
Well, about the future. Have you
decided what you're going to do?

1578
02:13:44,662 --> 02:13:46,152
Not particularly, sir.

1579
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:48,926
I always wanted to be
an aeronautical engineer.

1580
02:13:49,433 --> 02:13:51,628
I suppose I'll start studying again

1581
02:13:52,202 --> 02:13:53,567
after they muster me out.

1582
02:13:53,637 --> 02:13:55,628
Who said they'd muster you out?

1583
02:13:56,073 --> 02:13:57,768
Well, I won't be much
use to anybody with a...

1584
02:13:57,841 --> 02:13:59,741
What are you talking about?

1585
02:13:59,810 --> 02:14:03,337
Do you think we'd let a man of
your experience get away from us?

1586
02:14:04,281 --> 02:14:07,876
- Well, that's fine, sir. Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

1587
02:14:10,321 --> 02:14:12,084
I just happened to think
of something, Lawson.

1588
02:14:12,156 --> 02:14:13,156
Yes, sir?

1589
02:14:13,757 --> 02:14:15,418
What about your wife?
Does she knew you're back?

1590
02:14:15,492 --> 02:14:16,857
- No, sir.
- Why not?

1591
02:14:17,628 --> 02:14:22,156
Well, I thought I'd wait till I get
my new leg and my scars fixed up.

1592
02:14:22,232 --> 02:14:23,893
It won't be so much of
a shock to her that way.

1593
02:14:23,967 --> 02:14:27,869
Shock? What kind of a
girl did you marry, anyway?

1594
02:14:27,938 --> 02:14:30,771
She's okay, sir. She's a fine girl.

1595
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:33,166
Well then, she deserves to know.

1596
02:14:33,744 --> 02:14:35,006
She deserves to see you too.

1597
02:14:35,079 --> 02:14:37,809
No, no, sir. If you don't
mind, I'd rather wait.

1598
02:14:38,115 --> 02:14:40,083
When I see Ellen again, I'm
going to be all dressed up

1599
02:14:40,150 --> 02:14:42,118
and have a new leg.

1600
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:45,848
And I'm going to take her
out to the best place in town

1601
02:14:47,224 --> 02:14:49,249
and I'm going to dance with her.

1602
02:14:51,795 --> 02:14:54,889
- That may be quite a while, Lawson.
- No, sir.

1603
02:14:54,965 --> 02:14:57,263
You see, I'm getting along
fine. And in a month or two...

1604
02:14:57,334 --> 02:15:00,235
In a month or two you'll
be back at work, hard work.

1605
02:15:04,041 --> 02:15:06,305
Well, I'll try to drop
in on you again, Lawson.

1606
02:15:06,377 --> 02:15:07,844
- I hope you can, sir.
- Goodbye.

1607
02:15:07,911 --> 02:15:09,208
Goodbye, sir.

1608
02:15:15,886 --> 02:15:17,285
Your wife's going to have a baby, isn't she?

1609
02:15:17,354 --> 02:15:18,514
Yes, sir.

1610
02:15:21,959 --> 02:15:24,985
I've got a couple of kids
myself, both in the service.

1611
02:15:26,964 --> 02:15:31,128
You know, Lawson, if my kids and all
the other kids who are in this thing

1612
02:15:31,201 --> 02:15:35,831
could fix it so this would
really be the last one,

1613
02:15:35,906 --> 02:15:38,534
your kid would get quite
a break, wouldn't he?

1614
02:15:38,742 --> 02:15:40,471
He sure would, sir.

1615
02:16:19,817 --> 02:16:22,012
I just had to come.

1616
02:16:24,888 --> 02:16:27,789
Ted, Ted, Ted. Let me help you.

1617
02:16:27,858 --> 02:16:29,985
Don't, Ellen. You'll hurt the baby.

1618
02:16:39,102 --> 02:16:40,364
When things were worst,

1619
02:16:40,437 --> 02:16:43,133
when there didn't seem
to be any chance at all,

1620
02:16:43,207 --> 02:16:47,075
I could see your face, your beautiful face.

1621
02:16:50,481 --> 02:16:53,314
I knew you were coming home, Ted.

1622
02:16:55,486 --> 02:16:56,748
Tell me, honey.

1623
02:16:57,321 --> 02:16:59,016
How come you're so cute?

1624
02:16:59,456 --> 02:17:03,893
I had to be if I was going to
get such a good looking fellow.

1625
02:17:58,982 --> 02:17:59,982
English

1626
