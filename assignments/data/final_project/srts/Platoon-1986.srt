1
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:58,522
Oh, man! Is that what I think it is?

2
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:01,767
All right, you cheese-dicks,
welcome to the Nam.

3
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,940
Follow me.

4
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:13,735
Dipped in shit! New meat!

5
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,074
- You dudes gonna love the Nam!
- For fucking ever!

6
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,365
365 and a wake-up!

7
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,288
- Oh, Lord!
- Sin loi, buddy.

8
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:34,507
SEPTEMBER 1967-
BRAVO COMPANY, 25TH INFANTRY

9
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:37,760
SOMEWHERE NEAR
THE CAMBODIAN BORDER

10
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:57,742
Get him up here.

11
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:19,429
Sky Six, Ripper Six,
radio check. Over.

12
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:27,146
Watch it below!

13
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:53,415
Morehouse, drop back to slack!

14
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,474
Who's on tail end? Charlie?

15
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:18,898
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six.
Pos rep follows...

16
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,532
Warren, you get out on flank.

17
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,242
- Say, Hoffmeister!
- Yo?

18
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,417
- Got a smoke?
- No, man, I don't!

19
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:34,586
Sin loi, man.

20
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,625
Bravo Two-Six,

21
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,962
what's the delay up on point?
You having compass trouble again?

22
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,892
Come on, you... Shit!

23
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,915
Get a move on, boy!

24
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:43,111
Hey, boy, what ya waiting for?

25
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,280
He ain't gonna bite you.

26
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,448
That's a good gook.

27
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:49,820
Good and dead.

28
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:17,686
Yo! Tony!

29
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:22,683
252 actual. Move it out. Six says
we're jamming 'em up back there.

30
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,145
Tell that dipshit to get fucked!

31
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:29,231
Bravo, it's Two-Five. Be advised,
we're moving out shortly. Out.

32
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:32,286
What the hell's the matter
with you, Taylor?

33
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:36,113
- You are one simple sonofabitch!
- I'm sorry, Sergeant.

34
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,868
Get that other cherry up here -
Gardner. And the doc.

35
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:41,961
Gardner! Doc! Up!

36
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,256
Gardner, Doc, to the front!

37
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:48,005
- Gardner, up!
- Gardner, up!

38
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:51,054
Gardner, get your ass up the hill,
you fat fuck!

39
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:53,221
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

40
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,739
You all right?

41
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:14,537
Ants. I got ants all over my neck.

42
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,328
You got some red ants.

43
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,497
Reds are killers.

44
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:24,040
Black ants are the worst.

45
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,211
Hurry up, lard-ass!

46
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:34,588
Just a little. Don't drink too much.

47
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:38,887
I don't want you drinking any more.
I don't want you cramping up.

48
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,510
You're humping too much stuff, troop.

49
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:43,723
You don't need half this shit.

50
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,981
I'll haul it for you,

51
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,396
but next time you check
with me first, all right?

52
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,986
OK. Thanks, Sarge.

53
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,911
Are you OK?

54
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,665
Yeah.

55
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:13,083
Two-Two, this is Six.

56
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:17,347
I understand you have a bird
inbound at your pos at this time.

57
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:21,810
Bravo Six, Bravo Six, be advised,

58
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:26,099
re-supply helo is inbound
at this time. Over.

59
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,777
Let's go, you people!
Get that ammo off now!

60
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,450
Let's move it!

61
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:16,813
It ain't D-E-R-E, it's D-E-A-R,

62
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:21,574
and "Sarah" ain't got no two Rs, King.
Damn, you dumb!

63
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:25,367
It don't make no difference.
She know what I mean.

64
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:28,914
She don't read too good nohow!

65
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,961
Look at this shit! Pork again!

66
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:40,005
Let me have that turkey loaf
for this pork shit. I can't eat this shit!

67
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:42,628
What you been smoking, Junior?

68
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,260
I hope you don't get that laundry gig.
I hope Manny get it,

69
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:48,681
cos your ass need to hump,
hump and hump!

70
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,303
Hey, white boy... what you waiting for?

71
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:53,598
That hole ain't gonna dig itself.

72
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:58,561
Come on, get your dick-skin on that thing!
Dig! You ain't got all day! Dig! Dig!

73
00:10:00,156 --> 00:10:04,485
Somebody once wrote:
"Hell is the impossibility of reason. "

74
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:07,655
That's what this place feels like - hell.

75
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:10,114
I hate it already and it's only been a week.

76
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,871
Some goddamn week, Grandma.

77
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:17,580
The hardest thing I've ever done is
go on point. Three times this week.

78
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:19,542
I don't know what I'm doing.

79
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:23,340
A gook could be three feet in front of me
and I wouldn't know it.

80
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,380
I'm so tired.

81
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,553
We get up at 5am,

82
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:30,470
hump all day,
camp around four or five,

83
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:32,642
dig a foxhole, eat,

84
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:36,140
then put out an all-night ambush
or a three-man listening post.

85
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:39,441
It's scary cos nobody tells me
how to do anything, cos I'm new.

86
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:43,946
Nobody cares about new guys.
They don't even wanna know your name.

87
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:48,285
A new guy's life isn't worth as much
cos he hasn't put his time in yet.

88
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,867
They say if you're gonna get killed
in the Nam,

89
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:53,868
it's better to get it in the first few weeks.

90
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,538
The logic being
you don't suffer that much.

91
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:59,338
If you're lucky,
you stay in the perimeter at night.

92
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:01,503
Then you pull a three-hour guard shift.

93
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:05,464
Maybe you sleep three, four hours
a night... But you don't really sleep.

94
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:16,303
I don't think I can keep this up
for a year, Grandma.

95
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:19,523
I think I've made a big mistake
coming here.

96
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:23,900
We got boo-coo movement.

97
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,940
Third Battalion just got hit
15 kliks north of here.

98
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:32,864
Charlie had claymores
strung up in the trees,

99
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:35,748
blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces.

100
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:37,913
Bad shit.

101
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:44,712
Yeah. They got two lieutenants
and a captain.

102
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,465
Jesus!

103
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:49,629
All right, Sergeant,
who do you want on ambush?

104
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:53,469
Elias... you take your squad out.

105
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:58,766
Warren, you stay in, but I'll need
Tex and Junior from your squad.

106
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:02,348
- Roger that.
- OK, move out in two-zero mikes.

107
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:07,061
- I thought it was O'Neill's turn.
- No! Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

108
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:11,194
Fu Sheng's on an R and R tomorrow, and
you wanna send them out on an ambush?

109
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:13,533
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

110
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:17,907
They don't know shit, and chances are
we're gonna run into something.

111
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,745
That's just great, Bob.
What do you want me to do?

112
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:25,538
Send one of my guys to get zapped, so
some lame-ass can get his beauty sleep?

113
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:27,831
- Nah!
- Hey, O'Neill...

114
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:31,833
Take a break! You don't have to
be a prick every day of your life!

115
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,009
Elias, get your men ready.

116
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,309
He's in three years and thinks
he's Jesus fucking Christ!

117
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:43,595
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in,
but you go out. I need veterans out there.

118
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,563
Sergeant Barnes.

119
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:49,733
Sergeant.

120
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:56,484
I think, in front of the men,
it's necessary for me to give the orders.

121
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:02,450
Yes, sir.

122
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:07,706
Shit, looks like it's gonna rain.

123
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:10,756
It's gonna piss on us all night.

124
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:15,921
I'm gonna put a serious case of crotch-rot
on that ugly face of yours, Junior.

125
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:22,470
Goddamn, man! You break your ass for
the white man! No justice around here!

126
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,971
What's O'Neill got?
A nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

127
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,679
How come
we always get fucking ambush?

128
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:31,818
Cos it's politics, man, politics.

129
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,566
Hey, Chris, I show you a picture
of Lucy Jean?

130
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:36,897
No, you didn't.

131
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:40,117
She's the one for me all right,
that Lucy Jean.

132
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:44,953
- She's waiting for me.
- Real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

133
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,371
- Hey, you got a picture of your girl?
- No.

134
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:51,167
I guess that leaves some unlucky girl
back at home, don't it?

135
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:54,296
Tuck this in.

136
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,965
Shitcan this.

137
00:13:57,678 --> 00:14:00,347
Don't need this. Turn around.

138
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,469
Come on.

139
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:09,434
Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here
on your position.

140
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:12,234
Goddamn it, Elias,
don't mess with my pig!

141
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:16,606
I ain't getting greased, so you keep
this sorry cheese-dick off my ass!

142
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:19,775
You got Taylor. Gardner, you're with me.

143
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:24,734
Look, case anything happens to you,
you get lost or separated,

144
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:26,531
don't yell out, OK?

145
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,286
- OK.
- Just sit tight and we'll get to you.

146
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:31,457
- All right.
- Yo!

147
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,211
Saddle up!

148
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:35,377
Lock and load!

149
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:41,804
# I come from Alabama
with my banjo on my knee

150
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:45,391
# And I'm going to Louisiana

151
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:49,061
# my true love for to see

152
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:52,898
# Oh, Susanna

153
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:56,986
# Don't you cry for me

154
00:14:57,695 --> 00:15:02,074
# For I come from Alabama
with my banjo...

155
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,631
Mom and Dad didn't
want me to come here.

156
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:33,267
They wanted me to be like them:
Respectable, hard-working,

157
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,435
a little house, a family.

158
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:38,850
They drove me crazy
with their goddamn world, Grandma.

159
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:41,024
You know Mom.

160
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:45,275
I guess I've always been
sheltered and special.

161
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:48,658
I just wanna be anonymous
like everybody else,

162
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,825
do my share for my country.

163
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:54,205
Live up to what Grandpa did in the
first war, and Dad did in the second.

164
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,002
Well, here I am, anonymous,

165
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,701
with guys nobody really cares about.

166
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:02,163
Most come from the end of the line,

167
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:05,051
small towns you never heard of.

168
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:08,427
Pulaski, Tennessee.
Brandon, Mississippi.

169
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:11,639
Pork Bend, Utah.
Wampum, Pennsylvania.

170
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:14,222
Two years' high school's about it.

171
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:18,895
If they're lucky, a job waiting for them
back in a factory. Most have got nothing.

172
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:21,063
They're poor. They're the unwanted.

173
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:24,110
Yet they're fighting
for our society and our freedom.

174
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:28,650
It's weird, isn't it? At the bottom
of the barrel, and they know it.

175
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:31,950
Maybe that's why
they call themselves "grunts",

176
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,995
cos a grunt can take it,
can take anything.

177
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:38,788
They're the best I've ever seen,
Grandma. The heart and soul.

178
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,919
Hey, Taylor...

179
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:46,337
Hey... cheese-dick, you're up.

180
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,506
- What?
- You're up.

181
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:53,010
Sure you know how to work
the claymores, dude?

182
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,136
I'm sure.

183
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:57,350
Flick the safety off
and bang on that sucker three times.

184
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,102
Three times. I got it.

185
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:07,819
Don't catch any Zs on me, buddy,
or I'll sling your sorry ass. You hear me?

186
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:09,689
OK.

187
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,956
Maybe I've finally found it
way down here in the mud.

188
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:26,375
Maybe from down here
I can start up again.

189
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:29,542
Be something I can be proud of
without having to fake it,

190
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,715
be a fake human being.

191
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:34,679
Maybe I can see something
I don't yet see, or

192
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,296
learn something I don't yet know.

193
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,303
I miss you. I miss you very much.

194
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,521
Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris.

195
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,908
Junior.

196
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,957
Junior... Hey.

197
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,918
- All right, motherfucker!
- It's your shift, man... OK?

198
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,802
Here, take this.

199
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,500
Blow the fucking claymore!
Take the safety off, goddamn it!

200
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,592
Take the safety off!

201
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,438
Feed me, Junior!
Get over here and feed me!

202
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,201
My fucking arm!

203
00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:46,966
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Easy, Tex! Easy, boy!

204
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:49,131
I can't even see!

205
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:56,763
- Doc, over here! Gardner's hit!
- Right there!

206
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:59,763
Oh, shit... I'm hit!

207
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,973
Taylor's hit!

208
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:05,147
Oh, shit!

209
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,019
- How bad is it?
- Dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!

210
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:12,191
Relax, man, it's a scratch.
Hold this on here.

211
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:14,447
Don't lie to me, Doc. How bad is it?

212
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:17,613
He let 'em walk right up on us!
He was sleeping on his shift!

213
00:22:17,747 --> 00:22:19,573
No, I did not.

214
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:23,123
Big Harold, keep an eye on him.
Don't let him go into shock.

215
00:22:24,128 --> 00:22:26,453
Shut up! Shut up and take the pain!

216
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,539
Take the pain!

217
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:57,149
Hey, little guy... you're gonna be OK.

218
00:22:57,285 --> 00:23:00,155
OK? Don't worry.

219
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:02,327
Big Harold,

220
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:05,038
do you know if...

221
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:07,207
if you're gonna die?

222
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:11,457
Do you feel like everything's
just gonna be fine?

223
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,125
Don't gimme that morbid bullshit!
You're about to get outta here.

224
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:20,840
They're gonna give you three hot meals
a day... White sheets...

225
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:24,723
Them pretty white nurses'll give you
blow jobs if you pay 'em enough!

226
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:27,890
- I heard about them white bitches!
- Don't babytalk him!

227
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:32,400
The cocksucker fell asleep!
He let 'em walk up on us, didn't do shit!

228
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,567
Just shut up, Junior.

229
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,357
You relax, OK, man?

230
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:39,530
OK...

231
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:42,533
It's not so bad...

232
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:45,323
Dying...

233
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,205
How long...

234
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:51,417
How long...

235
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,049
Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there. You're gonna make it!

236
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:10,261
Come on, Gardner, hang in there.
You're gonna make it!

237
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:12,805
Come on! Don't quit!

238
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:17,069
Come on, Gardner, help me!
Don't give up!

239
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,354
Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit.

240
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:57,353
Remember what it looks like.

241
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:03,615
You fuck up in a firefight and I goddamn
guarantee you a trip out of the bush,

242
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:05,822
in a body bag!

243
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:10,115
Out here, assholes, you keep
your shit wired tight at all times!

244
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,335
And that goes for you, shit-for-brains!

245
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:19,172
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush!

246
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:25,925
And the next sonofabitch I catch
copping Zs in the bush,

247
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:30,052
I'm personally gonna take
an interest in seeing him suffer.

248
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:32,892
I shit you not.

249
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,849
Doc... tag him and bag him!

250
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:40,897
I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.

251
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:43,899
- It was Junior...
- Shut your face, chicken-shit!

252
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,857
You in big trouble, boy!

253
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,074
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor -
everybody got one.

254
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:51,241
Knock it off!

255
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:55,369
We got two men need attention here.

256
00:25:57,043 --> 00:26:01,751
Police up your extra ammo and frags.
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

257
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,667
Junior,

258
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,840
Tony,

259
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:09,008
carry Gardner.

260
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:15,392
The man would be alive if he had
a few more days to learn something.

261
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:44,041
Hey, Taylor, what's in the breeze?

262
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:47,042
OK. Got light duty. Three days' worth.

263
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:50,010
No shit!
Too bad we're in base camp, anyway.

264
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:52,175
- What you got? Beers?
- Yeah.

265
00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:56,302
Stole me some from the Top's supply.
Shit, he been stealing it from us.

266
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:58,426
Taylor!

267
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:02,060
- Are you back?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

268
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:04,762
King, where did you get those beers, boy?

269
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,940
- I found it.
- You found it?

270
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:10,354
- You're going on report, son.
- Both of you, come with me.

271
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,528
I got a little job for you.

272
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:18,862
Goo-o-o-o-o-ood morning, Vietnam!

273
00:27:18,997 --> 00:27:21,037
Motherfucker!

274
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,457
Motherfucker!

275
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:28,580
I'm too short for this shit, man!

276
00:27:29,674 --> 00:27:32,877
They're always fucking with us...
no let-up!

277
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,054
Politics, man. Fucking politics.

278
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:42,885
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up
Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio!

279
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:48,683
39 and a wake-up, a pause for the cause,
and I'm a gone motherfucker!

280
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,900
- Back to the world!
- I hear you, man.

281
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:54,069
- Broke 100 the other day.
- No shit!

282
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:57,115
92 left to go. April 17.

283
00:27:58,202 --> 00:28:00,444
DEROS, man. Home to California.

284
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:04,280
I'm gonna be sitting outside,
checking out the babes on the beach.

285
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,741
The surfing's gonna be good!

286
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,959
March, man, in Tennessee.

287
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:14,834
Sniff the pines... sniff that
cross-mounted pussy down by the river!

288
00:28:14,968 --> 00:28:17,007
Hot damn!

289
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:21,882
Hey, Taylor, how long have you got left?
300 and what?

290
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,056
32.

291
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:27,267
332 days.

292
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:29,520
Sin loi, my boy!

293
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:33,148
I can't even remember
when I was 332, man!

294
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:35,519
You gotta, like, count backwards.

295
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:40,067
You know, you got 40 days in.
I mean, think positive, dude.

296
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,868
Hey, Taylor,
how the fuck you get here, anyway?

297
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:46,831
- You look educated.
- I volunteered.

298
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:49,579
- You did what?
- I volunteered. I...

299
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,206
dropped out of college, told 'em
I wanted the infantry, combat, Vietnam.

300
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,091
You volunteered for this shit, man?

301
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:59,459
Can you believe that?

302
00:28:59,595 --> 00:29:02,714
You's a crazy fucker... giving up college.

303
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,098
Didn't make much sense.
I wasn't learning anything.

304
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:09,143
I figured, why should
just the poor kids go off to war

305
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:11,762
and the rich kids
always get away with it?

306
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:15,896
- What we got here is a crusader.
- Sounds like it.

307
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:17,521
Shit!

308
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:21,983
You gotta be rich in the first place
to think like that.

309
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:25,197
Everybody know

310
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:31,329
the poor always being fucked over
by the rich. Always have, always will.

311
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:39,460
I tell you what - you be cool, I introduce
you round to some of the heads.

312
00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:41,501
What are the heads?

313
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:43,379
Later, man!

314
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,849
What's up, brother?

315
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:00,227
Your Highness has arrived!
Hey, what's happening?

316
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:03,114
I thought you was hanging ten
in Cambodia!

317
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,359
- Hey, man, how ya doing?
- How ya doing, man?

318
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:08,532
All right!

319
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:14,823
What you doing in the underworld,
Taylor?

320
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,082
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot.

321
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:19,785
This man here is Chris.
He been resurrected.

322
00:30:28,806 --> 00:30:30,181
Go ahead, Taylor.

323
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:32,881
- What?
- Are you lame or something?

324
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:37,221
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

325
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:49,607
Here!

326
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:51,570
Your shit's in the wind, troop!

327
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:57,038
Hey, man, what's happening?

328
00:30:57,167 --> 00:31:01,829
If you do that baa,
you'd better do it right.

329
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:05,415
You're weird, man.

330
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,468
You're a child, Lerner.
I don't waste time on you.

331
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:21,858
- First time?
- Yeah.

332
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:27,150
Then the worm has definitely turned
for you, man.

333
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,608
Feel good?

334
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:34,490
Yeah, it feels good.
I got no pain in my neck now.

335
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,289
Feeling good's good enough.

336
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,173
Put your mouth on this.

337
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:15,529
Where the hell is everybody, man?
They getting high, that's what.

338
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,744
Bunch of hopheads. They think
they're something special!

339
00:32:19,997 --> 00:32:22,868
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

340
00:32:23,626 --> 00:32:28,371
Redneck noise, dude, that's all it is.
Make about as much sense as you do.

341
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:32,625
All them chucks be rappin'
about how they losing their ho,

342
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,677
saying how they ain't got
no bread for beer.

343
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:40,138
Fuck that honky shit!
Gimme some Motown jams - dig it?

344
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:44,512
What are you talking shit for, man?

345
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:48,264
- Junior, you ever smoke any shit?
- That's right, dude!

346
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,184
Y'all be trying to keep the black man
down and string him out on that shit.

347
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,104
The time be's coming, my man,
when the black man throw that yoke off.

348
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,242
Simple - free your mind,
your ass will follow.

349
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:03,532
I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit,
everything kinda gets weird.

350
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:07,793
You hear that story about the gooks
putting chemicals in the grass?

351
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,326
So we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

352
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:13,796
Don't you worry, Bunny.
You's a killer anyway, man.

353
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,594
I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

354
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:20,135
Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy,
'cept maybe the Indy 500.

355
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,882
Only way you'd get some pussy is
if a bitch dies and wills it to you

356
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:25,845
and then... maybe!

357
00:33:29,523 --> 00:33:31,563
How's it going, Bunny?

358
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:33,316
LT,

359
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,483
check it out.

360
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:38,903
Like that?

361
00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:41,570
Terrific. I'll send it home.

362
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:44,453
Hey, Junior.

363
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:47,035
- Lieutenant.
- Hello, sir.

364
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:58,836
Hey, Rodriguez,
that's quite a shrine you got there.

365
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:00,842
Thank you, sir.

366
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,010
You... need anything?

367
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:04,764
No, sir.

368
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:08,800
This guy's easily three,
four times my size.

369
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:13,563
I got him in the O'Neill death grip.
He don't know whether to shit or go blind!

370
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:16,188
- Whaddaya say, LT?
- How ya doing, Red?

371
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:19,687
Not good. This cocksucker's got
every card in the deck.

372
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:23,107
- Full house.
- Look like you're doing all right!

373
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:25,911
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

374
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:28,527
Hey, Lieutenant,
some Kentucky windage?

375
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:31,081
Thanks, Sandy.

376
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:33,532
Play, Lieutenant?

377
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:37,251
Nah. Wouldn't wanna get raped
by you guys.

378
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:42,042
Why's that, Lieutenant?
What are you saving up to be? Jewish?

379
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,594
Jewish!

380
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:52,801
I gotta run. I'II, uh, catch you men later.
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

381
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,945
Well, that is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

382
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:08,280
What do you say there, Bob?
Guy like that make it? Yes or no?

383
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:12,407
I have to tell you,
that's precisely what I saw.

384
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,579
Sometimes I just look at a guy

385
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:17,282
and I know this fella's not gonna make it.

386
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:19,459
Just no fucking way.

387
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:23,755
Get it going now!

388
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:40,942
# People say I'm the life of the party

389
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:44,571
# Cos I tell a joke or two

390
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:48,199
# Although I might be laughing

391
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:51,619
# Loud and hearty

392
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:55,248
# Deep inside I'm blue

393
00:35:55,915 --> 00:36:00,419
# So take a good look at my face

394
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:02,922
# You see the smile

395
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:05,466
# Looks out of place

396
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:09,970
# If you look closer, it's easy to trace

397
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:13,766
# The tracks of my tears

398
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,476
Yeah!

399
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:18,645
# I need you
# Need you!

400
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:22,149
# Need you
# Need you!

401
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,106
New Year's Day, 1968.

402
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:29,354
Just another day. Staying alive.

403
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:32,656
There's been a lot of movement
near the Cambodian border.

404
00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:34,943
Regiments of NVA moving across.

405
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:37,949
A lot of little firefights, ambushes.

406
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:42,790
We drop bombs, then we walk through
the jungle like ghosts in a landscape.

407
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:05,061
Bunker.

408
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:07,309
Where?

409
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:36,178
Roger. Bunkers at point.
Two actuals on the way.

410
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:23,556
Bravo Six, Bravo Two. Be advised
there is a bunker complex up front.

411
00:38:23,683 --> 00:38:26,388
We're on the way down. Over.

412
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:30,603
See you next week!

413
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:54,000
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank -
about 50 metres.

414
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,502
Washington, you cover this side.

415
00:38:57,591 --> 00:39:00,213
- Yes, sir.
- Get off your ass, Harold.

416
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:02,382
Bummer!

417
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:59,190
Christ, look at that, will ya? The teapot's
still boiling! They were just here!

418
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,605
Man, this is spooky, Sander.
Let's get outta here.

419
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,103
Watch it... watch it!

420
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,531
Look what we got, Sal.

421
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,700
We got maps,

422
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:40,697
we got... S...

423
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,371
Man, this is gook stuff!
Let's get outta here!

424
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,337
No, Sal, this is important,
this is important.

425
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,799
Come on, let's leave! Let's go!

426
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:57,760
Booby trap! Get down!

427
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,176
Medic!

428
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,977
Holy jeez!

429
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,581
Goddamn it!

430
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,502
We got... We got two men down, sir.

431
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,630
There was an explosion.

432
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,001
Listen, we need help, sir, ASAP.

433
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:39,422
Move your ass outta here!
One round could get all you guys!

434
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,012
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

435
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:46,888
Lieutenant... tell Six we need engineers.
This pos is crawling with traps.

436
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:51,351
On their way. The NVA have been spotted
in the village half a klik down the river.

437
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,810
- Six says we gotta get there ASAP.
- OK.

438
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:58,489
Also, leave four of your men here,
and a medic, OK? Move it out.

439
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:24,766
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

440
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,854
- Hey, where's Manny?
- Manny?

441
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:32,851
- Hey, Washington!
- Manny?

442
00:43:35,152 --> 00:43:37,477
- Manny?
- Washington!

443
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:40,068
Manny, where you at?

444
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:08,852
We had to get to the village
before dark,

445
00:44:08,977 --> 00:44:12,143
so we left Elias with some men
to keep looking.

446
00:44:12,272 --> 00:44:15,806
But it was King who found him,
about a thousand yards downriver,

447
00:44:15,942 --> 00:44:17,981
not far from the village.

448
00:44:22,323 --> 00:44:24,362
It was the end of the mystery.

449
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:58,104
The motherfuckers!

450
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:08,736
The village which had stood
for maybe 1,000 years

451
00:45:08,868 --> 00:45:11,359
didn't know we were coming that day.

452
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:13,535
If they had, they would've run.

453
00:45:13,664 --> 00:45:18,492
Barnes was at the eye of our rage
and, through him, our Captain Ahab.

454
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:20,704
He would set things right again.

455
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:22,878
That day we loved him.

456
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:30,844
There he goes, Sarge!

457
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:39,098
- Check him out.
- Yeah, you got it, Sarge.

458
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:41,473
Tubbs, Ebenhock, let's go!

459
00:45:44,736 --> 00:45:46,978
Get that stupid look off your face!

460
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:53,157
Hey, piggy, piggy! Hey, pig!

461
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,622
Bunny, clear the hooches now!

462
00:46:00,752 --> 00:46:03,622
Spread out on the right!
OK, watch your back!

463
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:05,794
Let's go! Let's move 'em out!

464
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:12,001
Let's go! Move it! Go!

465
00:46:12,138 --> 00:46:14,843
- Move it!
- Come on, let's go!

466
00:46:16,267 --> 00:46:20,929
Let's go, Junior! Bring 'em in!
Get those people down here!

467
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:27,564
Get outta there, you fuckheads! Move!

468
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:44,787
Come on!

469
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,090
- Put 'em in the pig pen!
- Kill these!

470
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,759
Give me your willie pete!

471
00:46:57,765 --> 00:46:59,046
Shut up!

472
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,390
Get back!

473
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,013
Fire in the hole!

474
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:19,616
Get 'em outta here!

475
00:47:19,745 --> 00:47:21,785
Oh, fuck! We got one!

476
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,703
Get the fuck outta the hole!

477
00:47:27,836 --> 00:47:30,458
Get the fuck outta there!
Come on, motherfucker!

478
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:32,628
Be cool. They're scared, man.

479
00:47:32,758 --> 00:47:35,675
They're scared?
What about me, man?

480
00:47:35,802 --> 00:47:39,752
I'm sick of this fucking shit!
Come on, motherfucker! Move!

481
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,929
Watch this fucker!

482
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:46,305
Who the fuck do you think
they're fighting for? Got one more!

483
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:55,270
Well, well. What have we here?

484
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:02,116
We got one, two, three, four mag 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.

485
00:48:05,957 --> 00:48:10,665
Barnes, they got enough rice here
to feed a whole fucking regiment.

486
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:16,083
Sergeant Warren,
you bring that honcho over here.

487
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:17,759
Tubbs, get outta there.

488
00:48:17,885 --> 00:48:19,462
Junior, burn it.

489
00:48:20,054 --> 00:48:22,461
What the fuck's the matter?
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

490
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:24,881
Look like I was gonna fucking hurt you?

491
00:48:25,017 --> 00:48:28,717
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?

492
00:48:28,854 --> 00:48:31,641
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole!

493
00:48:31,773 --> 00:48:36,518
Get the fuck up here! Come here,
motherfucker! What are you smiling at?

494
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:39,274
Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?

495
00:48:39,406 --> 00:48:40,568
Do 'em, man!

496
00:48:40,907 --> 00:48:44,358
What are you smiling at?
You want something to smile at?

497
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:49,205
Motherfucker! Dance, motherfucker!

498
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:56,081
Dance, one-legger! Dance!

499
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:01,592
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

500
00:49:08,434 --> 00:49:10,510
Hey, man, come on. Let's go, man.

501
00:49:15,858 --> 00:49:19,357
Fucking pussy, man!
He's laughing at you!

502
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:21,526
That's the way the gook laughs.

503
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:23,648
Yeah, sure you are!

504
00:49:23,782 --> 00:49:25,822
You're real sorry, ain't ya?

505
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:30,947
You're just crying your little hearts out
about Sandy and Sal, and Manny!

506
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:33,951
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

507
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:36,123
Whaddaya say?

508
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:59,767
Holy shit! Did you see
that fucking head come apart, man?

509
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:04,314
I never seen brains like that before, man!

510
00:50:07,616 --> 00:50:10,736
I bet you the old bitch runs
the whole fucking show, man!

511
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:15,282
She probably cut Manny's throat.
Probably cut my balls off if she could.

512
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:19,627
We leave now, and nobody saw a fucking
thing! You understand me, Taylor?

513
00:50:19,753 --> 00:50:23,881
Come on, man, let's fucking do her!
Let's do this whole fucking village!

514
00:50:25,008 --> 00:50:27,926
Look at the scars
on this gook honcho, Sarge.

515
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:32,094
Get out of here, Tubbs.

516
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:43,605
Where'd he get these wounds?

517
00:50:47,947 --> 00:50:51,647
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
- He's a dink for sure!

518
00:50:53,411 --> 00:50:55,736
Ask him why these weapons were here.

519
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,452
They had no choice. The NVA killed
the old honcho when he said no.

520
00:51:03,587 --> 00:51:06,790
- All the rice is theirs.
- Bullshit, Lerner!

521
00:51:06,924 --> 00:51:10,375
Who the hell was the gook
we nailed on the riverbank?

522
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:20,850
He doesn't know. He says NVA ain't
been around in a couple of months.

523
00:51:20,979 --> 00:51:24,514
- Maybe it was a scout or something.
- Yeah, sure, a scout!

524
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:28,267
What about the fucking rice and
the weapons? Who are they for?

525
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:33,447
That cocksucker knows
what I'm saying, don't you, pop?

526
00:51:33,575 --> 00:51:35,900
Goddamn right he does!

527
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:39,404
- He's lying through his teeth!
- Waste the fucker!

528
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:42,705
Where the hell's the VC?

529
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,665
He swears he doesn't know anything.
He hates the NVA, but...

530
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:53,793
What's the bitch saying?

531
00:51:53,928 --> 00:51:56,419
She's going on about
why we killed the pigs.

532
00:51:56,555 --> 00:51:59,556
- They gotta make a living. All that shit.
- Jesus!

533
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,434
Shut up!

534
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:12,146
Shut the fuck up!

535
00:52:37,345 --> 00:52:41,294
You tell him, he starts talking
or I'm gonna waste more of 'em!

536
00:52:41,432 --> 00:52:43,057
Tell him, Lerner!

537
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:51,815
Hey, Sarge! Let us in on this, all right?

538
00:52:57,114 --> 00:52:59,901
Let's go for it!
Let's do the whole fucking village!

539
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:02,524
Come on!
What the fuck are we waiting for?

540
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,078
- Let's do 'em!
- Outta my way!

541
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:14,125
This is his daughter, right? Right?

542
00:53:22,972 --> 00:53:26,673
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

543
00:53:35,234 --> 00:53:36,432
Barnes!

544
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:40,529
Barnes!

545
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,233
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

546
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,532
Stay outta this, Elias.
This ain't your show.

547
00:53:54,503 --> 00:53:56,875
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

548
00:53:57,005 --> 00:54:01,133
- Get him, Barnes!
- Come on, Barnes! Come on, Barnes!

549
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,133
Get him!

550
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:05,420
Tear his fucking head off!

551
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:24,363
Break it up!

552
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,574
Break it up!

553
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:31,613
Goddamn!

554
00:54:31,747 --> 00:54:35,911
You're dead, Elias!
I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

555
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:38,997
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

556
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:42,249
This shit won't wash, you fucking puke!

557
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:44,422
Break it up! Shut up!

558
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:47,425
Break it up! Listen up!

559
00:54:48,514 --> 00:54:50,755
Captain says to torch this place!

560
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:54,302
Torch this place!
Blow the weapons in place!

561
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:57,354
Round up all suspected VC
and shake it up!

562
00:54:57,481 --> 00:55:00,150
- We ain't got much light left!
- Lieutenant...

563
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:03,976
- Why didn't you do something?
- What are you talking about?

564
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:06,733
You know what the fuck I'm talking about!

565
00:55:06,865 --> 00:55:12,025
No, I don't. I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about, Elias!

566
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,996
All right, move it out! Let's go!

567
00:55:18,126 --> 00:55:20,533
Taylor, let's go, for Christ's sake!

568
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,836
Move it out! Police up the weapons,
and let's go!

569
00:56:00,292 --> 00:56:02,331
Fire in the hole!

570
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:13,675
Fire in the hole!

571
00:56:58,265 --> 00:57:01,218
Hey, come on! Morehouse!

572
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,435
You fucker! Get outta here!
Get the fuck off!

573
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:08,145
Don't do it! Don't do it! You fucker!

574
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:10,314
What is this?

575
00:57:14,947 --> 00:57:18,897
- What, you a homosexual, Taylor?
- Taylor, she's a fucking dink!

576
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,608
She's a fucking human being, man!

577
00:57:21,746 --> 00:57:25,197
- Fuck you!
- You're a fucking cherry, Taylor!

578
00:57:25,332 --> 00:57:29,033
Fucking animal!
All of you, you're fucking animals!

579
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,996
Fucking lame fuck!

580
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,084
You don't belong in Nam, man!
Ain't your place at all!

581
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:36,624
You don't fucking get it, do you, man?

582
00:57:37,928 --> 00:57:39,885
You just don't fucking get it.

583
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:42,467
It's OK.

584
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:48,100
Get outta there!

585
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:50,515
Fuck you, man.

586
00:57:51,691 --> 00:57:54,229
Police up your dicks
and let's get outta here.

587
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:52,615
- I didn't see anything, sir.
- I did.

588
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,751
That dink was reported to me
as NVA by Sergeant Barnes, sir.

589
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:59,579
My report will include Lieutenant Wolfe
as being witness to the shooting.

590
00:58:59,716 --> 00:59:01,293
All right, Elias.

591
00:59:01,426 --> 00:59:03,050
Staff Sergeant Barnes.

592
00:59:03,594 --> 00:59:04,590
Sir!

593
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:07,757
I want a full report on this
when we get back to the CP.

594
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:12,351
You got it, and I can throw in
plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.

595
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:14,934
Not now, goddamn it, not now!

596
00:59:15,064 --> 00:59:19,062
We'll get into this when we get back
to camp. I can promise you something.

597
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:21,862
If I find out there was an illegal killing,

598
00:59:21,987 --> 00:59:24,063
there will be a court martial.

599
00:59:24,198 --> 00:59:28,527
Right now I need every man in the field.
And you two will cease fire.

600
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,697
Staff Sergeant Barnes, Sergeant Elias...

601
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,870
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

602
00:59:33,999 --> 00:59:38,495
We're back in that NVA bunker complex
tomorrow. This time from the east.

603
00:59:38,628 --> 00:59:43,207
You people get some rest and be back
here at the CP at 1900 for a briefing.

604
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:44,966
Yes, sir.

605
00:59:49,848 --> 00:59:51,674
Come on, man.

606
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:54,762
You think these chucks give a fuck
about you and me?

607
00:59:54,894 --> 00:59:58,939
It could just as well have been you,
Harold, if you got in Barnes' way.

608
00:59:59,065 --> 01:00:04,818
And that Bunny? That motherfucker's
crazy! I mean, he scares me, man.

609
01:00:04,946 --> 01:00:06,985
He just scares me.

610
01:00:07,114 --> 01:00:10,400
You bloods are getting
too hung up on all this shit.

611
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:13,369
These gooks are a lot smarter
than you think.

612
01:00:13,496 --> 01:00:15,903
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

613
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,740
They was NVA, every last one of 'em.

614
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:24,088
He's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way.

615
01:00:24,214 --> 01:00:28,461
A Christian don't go around a village
cutting off heads and shit.

616
01:00:28,594 --> 01:00:32,294
This shit is really getting outta
hand, man. Way outta control.

617
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:35,716
Seems to me that you don't seem
to know the difference,

618
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:38,555
the way you shoot up
that shit all the time.

619
01:00:39,187 --> 01:00:41,227
I don't know, brothers,

620
01:00:42,524 --> 01:00:45,193
but I'm hurting real bad inside.

621
01:00:47,362 --> 01:00:50,446
Don't worry about it.
Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

622
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:53,657
- He's a troublemaker.
- Elias is a water-walker.

623
01:00:53,785 --> 01:00:57,236
Like them politicians in Washington
trying to fight this war

624
01:00:57,371 --> 01:01:00,041
with one hand tied around their balls.

625
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:03,167
Ain't no need or time
for a courtroom out here.

626
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:06,954
- Sarge.
- Thanks, Bun.

627
01:01:08,048 --> 01:01:10,088
How'd it go there, Bob?

628
01:01:12,386 --> 01:01:15,671
Yeah, that-away, Sarge.
Fucking Elias, man.

629
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:18,214
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

630
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:21,885
He's gonna get everybody
in this platoon in deep shit.

631
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:24,428
Somebody oughta frag his ass.

632
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:28,432
So whaddaya think, Bob?
Gonna be an investigation or what?

633
01:01:29,569 --> 01:01:30,980
Bob?

634
01:01:32,113 --> 01:01:36,028
O'Neill, man, you worry too much.
Sarge'll take care of it.

635
01:01:41,873 --> 01:01:43,949
It's a beautiful night.

636
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:47,250
Yeah. I love this place at night.

637
01:01:47,378 --> 01:01:49,205
The stars...

638
01:01:51,466 --> 01:01:54,135
There's no right or wrong in 'em.

639
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,087
They're just there.

640
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,260
That's a nice way of putting it.

641
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:05,141
Barnes has got it in for you, doesn't he?

642
01:02:05,771 --> 01:02:07,929
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

643
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,641
And you? Do you believe?

644
01:02:15,155 --> 01:02:17,397
In '65... yeah.

645
01:02:19,618 --> 01:02:21,029
Now,

646
01:02:23,288 --> 01:02:24,699
no.

647
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:30,628
What happened today
is just the beginning.

648
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,336
We're gonna lose this war.

649
01:02:34,466 --> 01:02:36,458
Come on!

650
01:02:36,593 --> 01:02:39,677
You really think so? Us?

651
01:02:39,804 --> 01:02:43,138
We've been kicking
other people's asses for so long,

652
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:45,757
I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

653
01:02:56,195 --> 01:02:58,816
Day by day, I struggle to maintain

654
01:02:58,948 --> 01:03:01,439
not only my strength, but my sanity.

655
01:03:01,575 --> 01:03:04,778
It's all a blur. I have no energy to write.

656
01:03:05,955 --> 01:03:09,039
I don't know what's right
and what's wrong any more.

657
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,998
The morale of the men is low.
There's civil war in the platoon.

658
01:03:13,128 --> 01:03:15,619
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.

659
01:03:15,756 --> 01:03:20,750
There's a lot of suspicion and hate.
I can't believe we're fighting each other

660
01:03:20,886 --> 01:03:23,127
when we should be fighting them.

661
01:03:24,806 --> 01:03:29,053
Counting days, and the six inches
in front of my face. Not much else.

662
01:03:29,894 --> 01:03:34,188
Hope things are well, Grandma.
Tell Mom and Dad I...

663
01:03:34,315 --> 01:03:37,400
Well... just tell them. Chris.

664
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:03,551
Hey, big boy, I know you thought
you had that laundry gig all laid out.

665
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:07,965
I gotta paint myself white
just to get me one of them fucking jobs!

666
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:12,048
I got my request in for a circumcision!
I'm gonna get my big ass outta here!

667
01:04:12,185 --> 01:04:14,225
You gonna become a rabbi?

668
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:16,394
Leech.

669
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:20,939
All right!

670
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,109
Move it out!

671
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:29,107
Don't drink that, asshole.
You're gonna get malaria.

672
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:30,738
Yeah, I hope so!

673
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,364
Let's go!

674
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:12,911
Doc! Get up here! Lerner's hit!

675
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:20,456
Sergeant Warren's hit!

676
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:25,210
What the fuck's going on?

677
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:29,254
They got RPGs, man! It's an ambush!
They were fucking waiting for us!

678
01:05:29,385 --> 01:05:31,841
- Who's on point?
- Lerner and Warren!

679
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:34,011
Taylor, where are you going?

680
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:41,307
Goddamn it, you assholes!
Get some firepower up there!

681
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,780
Watch out! Rockets!

682
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:06,704
- Where the fuck's Lerner?
- He's over there! By the log!

683
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:33,817
Fire mission! Grid 649402.

684
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,987
Direction, 610...

685
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,035
Adjust fire! Over!

686
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:44,121
Lieutenant, they're gonna get in
tight under the arty!

687
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,413
Let me get some men and roll up
that flank. I can work right up on them!

688
01:06:48,545 --> 01:06:52,958
Get me Barnes! Elias, we got four down
up there! What do you want me to do?

689
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:58,550
Where the fuck is Red Platoon?
Tell those assholes to get up here!

690
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,009
- Elias, what the fuck are you!
- Listen, Barnes, there's holes here.

691
01:07:03,143 --> 01:07:06,060
Third Platoon's coming up here.
We're here.

692
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:10,399
Dinks get men in these holes,
they got us caught in the crossfire.

693
01:07:10,525 --> 01:07:12,601
Sounds pretty far out to me, Elias.

694
01:07:12,736 --> 01:07:16,021
I've seen it happen - la Drang in '66.

695
01:07:16,156 --> 01:07:18,825
They cut us to fucking pieces!
I need three men!

696
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:22,994
- OK, you got 'em. Take off.
- Keep pouring off that cover fire.

697
01:07:23,121 --> 01:07:26,869
I don't want to be stuck out there
with my ass hanging in the breeze!

698
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:30,997
You don't tell me
how to run my war, Elias!

699
01:07:31,128 --> 01:07:34,711
You go crying and rat-fucking
to brigade on your own time!

700
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,960
Out here you belong to me! Now, move!

701
01:07:38,093 --> 01:07:39,753
You're an asshole, Barnes!

702
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:42,378
Sir, get that asshole O'Neill up here!

703
01:07:42,514 --> 01:07:45,883
Two Charlie, this is two! Be advised!

704
01:08:24,096 --> 01:08:25,092
Stay down!

705
01:08:39,153 --> 01:08:40,979
- Ammo!
- Ammo!

706
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,286
Sarge! Short round!

707
01:09:26,949 --> 01:09:28,989
Medic!

708
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:39,287
Satchel charge!

709
01:09:43,131 --> 01:09:44,756
Doc!

710
01:09:45,634 --> 01:09:47,673
Doc, help me out!

711
01:09:53,975 --> 01:09:56,015
You OK?

712
01:09:56,144 --> 01:09:59,513
- Don't leave me, man.
- All right.

713
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:03,977
- Hey, Gator... you'll be OK, man.
- Don't leave me, man.

714
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:06,897
Gator, hang tough. You'll be OK.

715
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,069
Drop your rucks.

716
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:11,524
Taylor, you're coming with us.

717
01:10:12,702 --> 01:10:14,410
Please don't go! Don't!

718
01:10:14,537 --> 01:10:16,245
You're gonna be OK.

719
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:20,243
- Come on!
- Doc! Take care of him, man.

720
01:10:23,379 --> 01:10:26,000
Redleg! Redleg!
Ripper Bravo Two actual!

721
01:10:26,131 --> 01:10:28,171
Adjustment follows!

722
01:10:31,095 --> 01:10:35,175
You ignorant asshole! What the fuck
coordinates are you giving?

723
01:10:35,307 --> 01:10:39,435
You wasted a lot of people up there
with your fucked-up fire mission!

724
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:41,186
You know that?

725
01:10:42,189 --> 01:10:44,596
You know that? Ah, shit!

726
01:10:46,735 --> 01:10:49,771
Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo Two!

727
01:10:49,905 --> 01:10:52,822
Check your fire! Check your fire!

728
01:11:03,668 --> 01:11:05,328
They're coming.

729
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:10,336
Stagger yourself across this line.

730
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,506
Shoot anything that moves.

731
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:15,387
- They'll be coming from over there.
- Gotcha.

732
01:11:15,513 --> 01:11:18,763
Any one of 'em gets through,
we're truly fucked.

733
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:21,766
Where the hell are you going?

734
01:11:21,894 --> 01:11:25,014
Down by the river, about 100 metres,

735
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:27,187
in case they try to flank us.

736
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:30,103
Third Platoon's coming up to our rear,
so watch for 'em.

737
01:11:30,235 --> 01:11:32,144
Can I go with you?

738
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:33,899
No.

739
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:36,070
I move faster alone.

740
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,531
Come here. Let's let arty
do a little bit of the work here.

741
01:11:46,668 --> 01:11:49,788
You tell everybody to pull back
to the church.

742
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:52,756
We link up with Third Platoon.
You got that?

743
01:11:52,882 --> 01:11:56,750
What about Elias?
If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

744
01:11:56,886 --> 01:11:59,970
You just haul ass, too, Lieutenant!

745
01:12:01,307 --> 01:12:02,967
I'll get him.

746
01:12:42,013 --> 01:12:45,133
- I got two of them fuckers, man!
- I got one!

747
01:12:45,266 --> 01:12:47,936
Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dicks!

748
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:52,599
Crawford!

749
01:12:54,192 --> 01:12:55,187
Oh, man!

750
01:12:55,318 --> 01:12:58,568
Kiss my ass, man!
I never thought I'd get hit!

751
01:12:58,696 --> 01:13:02,445
It's a lung, babe.
You got two of them fuckers.

752
01:13:02,575 --> 01:13:07,035
Sarge, a bunch of gooks came through
there. We got three of the fuckers!

753
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:09,914
Did you hear the arty shift?
We're pulling back.

754
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,199
Get the fuck back to church.

755
01:13:12,334 --> 01:13:16,332
- Elias is still out there, Sarge!
- Taylor, I'll get him!

756
01:13:16,463 --> 01:13:20,675
You get Crawford in. Now! Before you
Article 15 both your asses! Move!

757
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:22,840
Move it!

758
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:19,162
We still got ya.

759
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:22,576
- Come on, brother.
- Medic, where the fuck are you?

760
01:15:22,711 --> 01:15:26,411
You're gonna be all right
in a minute, brother.

761
01:15:29,342 --> 01:15:31,382
Taylor, where are you going?

762
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,952
Elias is dead. Fall back with the platoon.

763
01:16:45,082 --> 01:16:47,704
- Get going.
- He's dead?

764
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:50,836
Yeah. He's back there about 100 metres.

765
01:16:50,963 --> 01:16:52,872
You saw him? Where?

766
01:16:53,007 --> 01:16:57,087
He's dead! There's gooks all over
the goddamn place! Get moving!

767
01:17:11,358 --> 01:17:13,931
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Move it!

768
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:53,480
Let's go! Move it, move it!
OK, let's go!

769
01:18:16,713 --> 01:18:20,924
You OK, Harold?
You're on the next one. You're OK, bud.

770
01:19:07,512 --> 01:19:08,508
Oh, fuck!

771
01:19:11,474 --> 01:19:13,383
They've got Elias!

772
01:19:13,518 --> 01:19:14,514
What?

773
01:19:21,276 --> 01:19:23,434
Back down! Back down there!

774
01:19:30,117 --> 01:19:34,162
Snake One-Nine, Fly Four.
There's still one of the men down there.

775
01:19:57,811 --> 01:20:00,812
Hold your armour!
Guns, guns, pull up, pull up!

776
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:03,395
We're trying to cover it on my side.

777
01:20:59,538 --> 01:21:04,080
He killed him. I know that he killed him.
I saw his eyes when he came back in.

778
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:08,620
How do you know the dinks didn't
get him? You got no proof, man.

779
01:21:08,755 --> 01:21:13,381
The proof's in the eyes, man. You were
there. I know what you were thinking.

780
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:15,549
I say we frag that fucker tonight!

781
01:21:15,678 --> 01:21:17,801
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

782
01:21:18,556 --> 01:21:21,094
I say let military justice do the job on him.

783
01:21:22,101 --> 01:21:25,137
Fuck the military justice!
Are you joking me?

784
01:21:25,271 --> 01:21:29,399
Who do you think they'll believe?
O'Neill? Bunny? Wolfe? Bullshit!

785
01:21:29,525 --> 01:21:31,564
Shit, man, you try that,

786
01:21:31,694 --> 01:21:34,564
Barnes'll shove it up your ass
with a candle on it!

787
01:21:34,697 --> 01:21:36,570
What do you suggest we do, huh?

788
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:38,940
I suggest you all watch your own asses!

789
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:41,745
Barnes is gonna
be coming down on all of 'em!

790
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:45,405
You gonna forget about Elias and all
the good times we done had in here?

791
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,660
You're trying to cure the headache
by cutting off the head.

792
01:21:49,753 --> 01:21:53,453
Elias didn't ask you to fight
his battles for him.

793
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:57,457
And if there's a heaven -
and, God, I hope there is -

794
01:21:57,594 --> 01:22:02,968
I know he's sitting up there drunk as
a fucking monkey, and smoking shit,

795
01:22:03,099 --> 01:22:05,471
cos he done left his pains down here.

796
01:22:05,602 --> 01:22:09,813
You're wrong, man! Any way you cut it,
Barnes is a fucking murderer!

797
01:22:09,939 --> 01:22:12,097
Taylor...

798
01:22:12,233 --> 01:22:16,859
I remember when you first came in here,
telling me how you admired the bastard!

799
01:22:16,988 --> 01:22:18,530
- I was wrong.
- Wrong?

800
01:22:18,656 --> 01:22:21,408
You ain't never been right...
about nothing!

801
01:22:22,326 --> 01:22:25,410
And dig this, you assholes,
and dig it good!

802
01:22:25,955 --> 01:22:28,955
Barnes has been shot seven times,
and he ain't dead!

803
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:31,870
Does that mean anything to you, huh?

804
01:22:32,002 --> 01:22:34,042
Barnes ain't meant to die!

805
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:38,332
The only thing
that could kill Barnes... is Barnes.

806
01:22:39,468 --> 01:22:41,507
Talking about killing?

807
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:55,729
You all experts?

808
01:22:57,527 --> 01:22:59,566
You all know about killing?

809
01:23:00,697 --> 01:23:03,022
I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

810
01:23:10,414 --> 01:23:13,748
You smoking this shit
so as to escape from reality?

811
01:23:16,587 --> 01:23:18,627
Me, I don't need this shit.

812
01:23:24,803 --> 01:23:26,843
I am reality.

813
01:23:33,562 --> 01:23:37,180
There's the way it ought to be,
and there's the way it is.

814
01:23:41,069 --> 01:23:43,109
Elias was full of shit.

815
01:23:44,865 --> 01:23:46,904
Elias was a crusader.

816
01:23:48,201 --> 01:23:52,151
I got no fight with any man
who does what he's told,

817
01:23:52,789 --> 01:23:55,873
but when he don't...
the machine breaks down.

818
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,253
And when the machine breaks down
we break down.

819
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:04,998
And I ain't gonna allow that

820
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:07,341
from any of you.

821
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,630
Not one.

822
01:24:25,738 --> 01:24:27,777
You all love Elias.

823
01:24:32,577 --> 01:24:34,617
You wanna kick ass.

824
01:24:41,044 --> 01:24:44,128
Well, here I am, all by my lonesome.

825
01:24:47,634 --> 01:24:50,385
And there ain't nobody gonna know.

826
01:24:55,558 --> 01:24:57,598
Six of you boys against me.

827
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:05,810
Kill me.

828
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:25,458
I shit on all of you!

829
01:25:28,215 --> 01:25:29,329
You motherfucker!

830
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:38,554
- Come on, man, get him!
- Oh, fuck!

831
01:25:38,683 --> 01:25:40,723
Get him, Chris!

832
01:25:44,189 --> 01:25:46,762
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.

833
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,726
You'll go dinky dow in LBJ.

834
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:51,267
Ten years for killing an enlisted man.

835
01:25:51,404 --> 01:25:54,689
Ten years climbing
the fucking walls, man!

836
01:25:56,826 --> 01:25:58,865
Don't do it!

837
01:26:16,929 --> 01:26:18,968
Death?

838
01:26:19,181 --> 01:26:21,672
What do you all know about death?

839
01:26:36,197 --> 01:26:39,198
They sent us back into the valley
the next day,

840
01:26:39,325 --> 01:26:42,445
about 2000 metres from Cambodia,
into a battalion perimeter.

841
01:26:42,579 --> 01:26:46,030
It felt like we were returning
to the scene of a crime.

842
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:23,485
Alpha Company had been hit hard
by a sizeable force

843
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:26,952
and Charlie Company
had been probed that night.

844
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,749
There were other battalions
in the valley,

845
01:27:29,874 --> 01:27:32,745
but we knew we were gonna be
the bait to lure them out.

846
01:27:32,877 --> 01:27:37,290
Somewhere out there
was the entire 141 st NVA Regiment.

847
01:27:55,733 --> 01:28:00,145
Caught those motherfuckers trying to
pull some shit on Charlie Company.

848
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:02,318
They found maps on 'em, man.

849
01:28:02,448 --> 01:28:07,026
A friend at Battalion says they had
every fucking foxhole fixed on it.

850
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:11,289
Distances... tree lines... our claymores...

851
01:28:11,415 --> 01:28:16,456
- Everything.
- This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here.

852
01:28:16,586 --> 01:28:19,124
I also heard
we're in fucking Cambodia now.

853
01:28:19,256 --> 01:28:22,007
Cambodia? Man, you kidding me!

854
01:28:22,133 --> 01:28:24,173
You wanted to see me, sir?

855
01:28:25,428 --> 01:28:29,129
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like
you got Elias's squad now.

856
01:28:29,265 --> 01:28:33,595
I didn't know we were still referring to
this platoon in terms of squads.

857
01:28:33,728 --> 01:28:38,306
All right, look... I want you to take
those two holes there and there.

858
01:28:38,441 --> 01:28:41,395
You're tying it off with Barnes
up here, King down there.

859
01:28:41,527 --> 01:28:45,655
Begging your pardon, sir.
My two holes are far enough apart

860
01:28:45,781 --> 01:28:48,533
you could run a regiment through
and never see 'em.

861
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:50,652
I got five live bodies left, sir.

862
01:28:50,786 --> 01:28:54,072
I don't wanna hear your problems.
You'll get new men any day.

863
01:28:54,206 --> 01:28:57,492
- Make do like everybody else.
- I didn't ask for this job.

864
01:28:57,626 --> 01:29:00,082
- I don't wanna hear it.
- You don't wanna hear it?

865
01:29:00,212 --> 01:29:05,503
That's right. I don't wanna hear it cos, to
tell you the truth, I don't give a shit, OK?

866
01:29:05,634 --> 01:29:07,673
I don't give a flying fuck any more.

867
01:29:08,303 --> 01:29:09,845
Right.

868
01:29:15,352 --> 01:29:17,807
I'm glad I ain't going with 'em.

869
01:29:20,315 --> 01:29:23,731
Somewhere out there's the beast,
and he hungry tonight.

870
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,899
What a fuckin' bummer!

871
01:29:26,029 --> 01:29:29,896
Ten days and a wake-up
and I'm still dealing with this shit.

872
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:35,778
What's the matter with you, man?

873
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:38,155
How come you ain't writing nobody?

874
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:43,367
What about your folks? That grandma
you was telling me about?

875
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:46,964
Girl?

876
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:54,096
Got a mother and father, don't you?
There must be somebody.

877
01:29:54,223 --> 01:29:56,262
Nah, there's nobody.

878
01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:00,769
You been smoking too much
of this shit, troop.

879
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:04,733
Gotta control that - bring a man down.

880
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:11,109
I remember when you first come out here
to the bush. You was green as a...

881
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:15,451
Ever get caught in a mistake that
you just can't get out of, King?

882
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,819
There's a way out of anything, man.

883
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:21,157
Just keep your pecker hard
and your powder dry

884
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,330
and the worm will turn.

885
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,913
How many days are you short?

886
01:30:29,048 --> 01:30:30,875
Nah, it's not just me.

887
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:35,220
It's the way the whole thing works.
People like Elias get wasted.

888
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:39,391
People like Barnes go on making up
the rules any way they want.

889
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:42,601
So what do we do?
Sit in the middle and suck on it.

890
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:46,434
We just don't add up to dry shit, King.

891
01:30:46,565 --> 01:30:48,605
Whoever said we did, man?

892
01:30:48,734 --> 01:30:51,569
All you got to do is make it outta here

893
01:30:51,695 --> 01:30:56,024
and it's all gravy. Every day,
the rest of your life - gravy!

894
01:30:58,994 --> 01:31:01,033
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

895
01:31:02,456 --> 01:31:05,825
King, collect up your shit.
Your order's just come through.

896
01:31:05,959 --> 01:31:10,336
- Don't fuck with me.
- What, you need a written invitation?

897
01:31:10,463 --> 01:31:14,461
Cocksucker! Oh, wow!
The lifers have made a mistake!

898
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:16,961
They cut me some slack, Taylor!

899
01:31:17,095 --> 01:31:21,223
Get your pig to Rodriguez. You got ten
minutes to make the last chopper out.

900
01:31:21,349 --> 01:31:24,136
If you're not on it... I'm gonna be.

901
01:31:25,311 --> 01:31:27,767
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

902
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:31,974
Great, King. I'm happy for you, man.
You take it on home for me, OK?

903
01:31:32,109 --> 01:31:34,944
You got my address.
You know where to get hold of me.

904
01:31:35,071 --> 01:31:38,938
I gotta di-di, man.
I don't wanna miss that chopper.

905
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:45,407
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

906
01:31:45,539 --> 01:31:47,330
Remember now, take it easy.

907
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:50,375
Don't think too much,
and don't you be no fool.

908
01:31:50,502 --> 01:31:54,630
Ain't no such thing as a coward
out here. It don't mean nothing.

909
01:31:54,756 --> 01:31:56,796
My man!

910
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:05,429
I'll walk you out, man.

911
01:32:10,563 --> 01:32:11,974
Take it easy, King.

912
01:32:12,107 --> 01:32:14,432
I'll take it any way I can get it, brother!

913
01:32:14,567 --> 01:32:15,682
Later!

914
01:32:16,527 --> 01:32:18,935
I'm pretty fucked up, Sarge.
No, man, don't touch this!

915
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:21,402
I gotta get on that chopper, man!

916
01:32:21,532 --> 01:32:24,450
- So what's the problem?
- Says he can't walk.

917
01:32:24,577 --> 01:32:26,404
Shit!

918
01:32:27,663 --> 01:32:30,119
Martin... get your boots on.

919
01:32:33,878 --> 01:32:38,374
Next time I catch you spraying
'skeeter repellant on your fucking feet,

920
01:32:38,507 --> 01:32:41,508
I'm gonna court-martial your nigger ass.

921
01:32:41,635 --> 01:32:44,126
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

922
01:32:44,263 --> 01:32:46,932
Bust my ass!
Send me to fucking Long Binh!

923
01:32:47,057 --> 01:32:49,050
Do your fucking worst!

924
01:32:49,184 --> 01:32:52,553
You white folks have got
your last klik outta Junior!

925
01:32:53,605 --> 01:32:56,178
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

926
01:32:56,316 --> 01:32:58,439
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.

927
01:32:58,568 --> 01:33:03,444
That... long, hairy, red and black
bastard I found in the ammo crate.

928
01:33:04,991 --> 01:33:07,197
I'll put it in his crotch, see if he can walk.

929
01:33:07,327 --> 01:33:08,441
I remember now.

930
01:33:10,288 --> 01:33:13,538
Hold up, man! You just hold up!
Wait, all right?

931
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:16,750
Fuck it, I'll walk!
I'll fucking walk, man!

932
01:33:16,878 --> 01:33:19,665
Fucking pussy!
Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?

933
01:33:19,797 --> 01:33:21,339
Yeah.

934
01:33:21,465 --> 01:33:24,135
Bob? I'd like to speak to you a minute.

935
01:33:28,556 --> 01:33:30,595
I can't take it no more!

936
01:33:31,767 --> 01:33:35,302
- I'd like to speak to you. Bob...
- Yeah, what is it?

937
01:33:35,896 --> 01:33:39,063
Bob, I got Elias's R and R.
It's coming up in three days.

938
01:33:39,191 --> 01:33:42,145
I was thinking about going
to Hawaii to see Patsy.

939
01:33:42,277 --> 01:33:45,029
Bob, I never asked you
for a fucking thing.

940
01:33:45,155 --> 01:33:49,022
To be honest, I hoped you'd put me
on that chopper with King.

941
01:33:49,159 --> 01:33:52,859
- Whaddaya say, chief-a-rooney?
- I can't do that for you, Red.

942
01:33:52,996 --> 01:33:56,116
We need every swinging dick
in the field. You know that.

943
01:33:56,249 --> 01:33:59,583
Talk to me! All I'm asking you for
is three fucking days here!

944
01:33:59,711 --> 01:34:02,332
I am talking to you, Red,
and I'm telling you no.

945
01:34:03,173 --> 01:34:06,008
- Get back in your foxhole!
- Bob...

946
01:34:06,134 --> 01:34:08,803
I got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

947
01:34:09,595 --> 01:34:11,635
I got a bad feeling.

948
01:34:12,557 --> 01:34:15,012
I don't think I'm gonna make it outta here.

949
01:34:15,143 --> 01:34:17,598
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

950
01:34:18,145 --> 01:34:21,016
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

951
01:34:28,906 --> 01:34:31,112
Oh... shit!

952
01:34:43,629 --> 01:34:47,211
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

953
01:35:00,186 --> 01:35:01,562
There goes a fucking ambush.

954
01:35:01,688 --> 01:35:04,013
They ain't even waiting till later.

955
01:35:04,148 --> 01:35:06,604
It's fucking coming now, man.

956
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:09,521
Right fucking now.

957
01:35:13,866 --> 01:35:17,449
You know, Junior,
some of the things we done, man,

958
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:20,496
I don't feel like we done
something wrong.

959
01:35:20,623 --> 01:35:22,662
Sometimes, man,

960
01:35:24,335 --> 01:35:26,374
I get this bad feeling.

961
01:35:29,715 --> 01:35:32,206
I told the padre the truth, man.
I like it here.

962
01:35:32,342 --> 01:35:35,427
You get to do what you want.
Nobody fucks with you.

963
01:35:35,554 --> 01:35:37,796
The only worry you got is dying.

964
01:35:37,931 --> 01:35:42,842
If that happens, you won't know about
it anyway. So what the fuck, man?

965
01:35:42,978 --> 01:35:46,144
Shit! I gotta be in this hole with you, man?

966
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:49,561
I just know I shouldn't have come.

967
01:35:51,319 --> 01:35:55,780
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging
with Audie Murphy here, my man!

968
01:35:57,825 --> 01:36:00,826
Bravo Three, Bravo Six.
Send me a grid. Over.

969
01:36:00,954 --> 01:36:04,536
I can't, sir! We're pinned down!
They're in the fucking trees!

970
01:36:04,665 --> 01:36:09,411
Calm down, son. I'll get you a fire
mission ASAP. Smoke'll be first.

971
01:36:09,545 --> 01:36:13,459
Lieutenant's dead, radio man's dead.
I don't know where the map is.

972
01:36:13,591 --> 01:36:17,505
They're all around us - hundreds!
I can hear 'em talking gook.

973
01:36:17,636 --> 01:36:22,547
OK, now spot that smoke and tell me
where to shift. Calm down, son.

974
01:36:22,683 --> 01:36:25,933
We'll get you out.
Tell me where the rounds hit. Over.

975
01:36:42,827 --> 01:36:47,370
Three Alpha Six, how about those rounds,
son? Can you adjust fire? Over.

976
01:36:51,211 --> 01:36:55,623
Three Alpha Six, if you can't talk, son,
just key your handset twice. Over.

977
01:37:10,855 --> 01:37:11,969
Shit!

978
01:37:56,732 --> 01:37:58,772
Trip flare - Rodriguez's hole!

979
01:38:04,448 --> 01:38:05,444
RPG!

980
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:10,078
Doc!

981
01:38:10,204 --> 01:38:12,576
- Taylor! Francis!
- Over here, man!

982
01:38:12,706 --> 01:38:17,167
What the fuck's going on?
Rodriguez's hole just got nailed, man!

983
01:38:17,294 --> 01:38:20,295
Here it is, man. We got gooks
in the fucking perimeter!

984
01:38:20,422 --> 01:38:22,296
Shit, that's it!

985
01:38:22,424 --> 01:38:27,050
Anything behind you don't identify
itself, fucking blow it away, OK?

986
01:38:27,179 --> 01:38:31,757
Fuck! Two! Air strikes coming in -
they'll be laying snake and nape.

987
01:38:31,892 --> 01:38:36,684
Don't get outta your fucking holes.
Stay right here, man. Fuck!

988
01:38:42,026 --> 01:38:46,154
They're probing. They'll search this
line all night trying to get through.

989
01:38:46,281 --> 01:38:49,649
All right, stay here, stay cool.
I'll be right back.

990
01:39:09,762 --> 01:39:11,220
Who is it?

991
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:15,430
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

992
01:39:21,231 --> 01:39:24,315
It's the ambush! Over here, man, hurry!

993
01:39:27,737 --> 01:39:30,275
- Oh, shit!
- Water!

994
01:39:30,407 --> 01:39:33,822
They're all over the place!
Hundreds of 'em - moving this way!

995
01:39:35,662 --> 01:39:39,161
They wiped us out, man! We didn't
have a chance! Where's the CP?

996
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:41,532
- Back there!
- You guys get outta here!

997
01:39:41,668 --> 01:39:45,665
They're right on my ass!
They ain't stopping for shit!

998
01:39:47,006 --> 01:39:48,666
Taylor, man, let's di-di.

999
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:51,591
You go.

1000
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:01,850
There!

1001
01:40:36,596 --> 01:40:38,635
No, hold it, hold it!

1002
01:40:55,197 --> 01:40:57,605
Out of the hole! Fast!

1003
01:40:59,868 --> 01:41:02,822
Get outta the fucking hole!
They're gonna blow it!

1004
01:41:02,955 --> 01:41:05,624
Let's go, let's go!

1005
01:41:05,749 --> 01:41:08,454
Francis, move your fucking ass!
They're gonna...

1006
01:41:28,396 --> 01:41:30,187
Follow me.

1007
01:41:30,648 --> 01:41:32,440
What is it?

1008
01:41:46,288 --> 01:41:48,530
Die, you motherfuckers!

1009
01:42:01,011 --> 01:42:03,051
It's fucking beautiful!

1010
01:42:14,691 --> 01:42:16,730
Come on, motherfuckers!

1011
01:42:21,197 --> 01:42:23,356
Come on! You can do better than that!

1012
01:42:23,491 --> 01:42:26,492
They just keep coming, man!
Fuck this shit!

1013
01:42:29,205 --> 01:42:31,874
Get back here, you gutless shit!

1014
01:43:31,182 --> 01:43:33,424
- Get me Bravo!
- Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand.

1015
01:43:33,517 --> 01:43:35,676
Three holes down. They need help.

1016
01:43:35,811 --> 01:43:38,302
OK, get two squads from Alpha
down there! Go!

1017
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:40,478
Where's that goddamn air strike?

1018
01:43:42,568 --> 01:43:45,485
Hey, you people!
Where the fuck are you going?

1019
01:43:53,203 --> 01:43:54,448
Sir!

1020
01:44:04,005 --> 01:44:08,217
- Can't you get anybody?!
- Negative contact! I can't raise Barnes!

1021
01:44:08,343 --> 01:44:10,382
- Nothing!
- Get me Six!

1022
01:44:10,512 --> 01:44:13,299
- Bravo Six, Bravo Six!
- It's Doc!

1023
01:44:13,431 --> 01:44:16,302
- Get him in!
- Come on!

1024
01:44:17,727 --> 01:44:21,641
They're coming through our line!
I can't do anything!

1025
01:44:21,773 --> 01:44:25,058
- Where's Barnes?
- Dead! I think they're all dead!

1026
01:44:25,193 --> 01:44:28,561
- Give it up, Doc! He's dead!
- Six, LT! Six!

1027
01:44:28,696 --> 01:44:32,396
Captain, we've been overrun!
We're pulling back! Over!

1028
01:44:32,533 --> 01:44:35,404
Goddamn it!
Where are you gonna pull back to?

1029
01:44:35,536 --> 01:44:37,612
They're all over the perimeter!

1030
01:44:37,746 --> 01:44:41,447
You be advised, you will hold
in place and you will fight!

1031
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:44,501
That means you, Lieutenant!
Bravo Six out.

1032
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:17,243
Be advised,
we got zips in the wire down here.

1033
01:45:17,368 --> 01:45:20,203
Roger your last, Bravo Six.
Can't run it any closer.

1034
01:45:20,329 --> 01:45:23,533
We're hot to trot and packing snake
and nape, but we're bingo on fuel.

1035
01:45:24,375 --> 01:45:29,120
For the record, it's my call! Dump
everything you've got left on my pos!

1036
01:45:29,296 --> 01:45:33,424
I say again, expend all remaining
in my perimeter!

1037
01:45:34,051 --> 01:45:37,135
It's a lovely fucking war. Bravo Six out.

1038
01:45:39,223 --> 01:45:42,674
Roger your last, Bravo Six.
We copy. It's your call.

1039
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:45,929
Get 'em in their holes down there.
Hang tough, Bravo Six.

1040
01:45:46,063 --> 01:45:48,435
We are coming cocked for treetops.

1041
01:46:12,588 --> 01:46:13,917
Barnes!

1042
01:46:16,551 --> 01:46:18,377
Barnes!

1043
01:46:21,639 --> 01:46:23,050
No!

1044
01:49:13,514 --> 01:49:15,553
Get me a medic.

1045
01:49:17,476 --> 01:49:19,516
Go on, boy!

1046
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:39,162
Do it.

1047
01:50:10,277 --> 01:50:13,777
Look out, Mad Dog!
We got live gooks at three o'clock!

1048
01:50:13,906 --> 01:50:16,397
What's down here? Let's go!

1049
01:50:18,285 --> 01:50:21,654
Come on, Elmo!
Move your flea-bitten ass!

1050
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:26,664
Hey... you OK?

1051
01:50:27,544 --> 01:50:30,711
You all right? Can you walk? Huh?

1052
01:50:31,423 --> 01:50:34,589
Hey, Doc!
We need a medic up here!

1053
01:50:35,302 --> 01:50:38,505
- Come on, Elmo.
- Come on, Doc! We got wounded here!

1054
01:50:57,573 --> 01:51:00,360
Hey, that must've been
some fucking fight.

1055
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,199
You alone here, man?

1056
01:51:04,038 --> 01:51:05,366
Yeah.

1057
01:51:05,498 --> 01:51:08,783
The bunch of fucking faggots,
they all left me!

1058
01:51:57,048 --> 01:52:01,377
122 wounded and still counting.

1059
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:04,844
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA.

1060
01:52:04,972 --> 01:52:07,427
122 and still counting. Over.

1061
01:52:14,856 --> 01:52:16,055
Hey, Taylor!

1062
01:52:16,775 --> 01:52:19,100
- Hey, Francis.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

1063
01:52:19,236 --> 01:52:21,027
I'm OK. How are you doing?

1064
01:52:21,154 --> 01:52:23,194
Just fine, man! Hey, dig it!

1065
01:52:23,323 --> 01:52:26,075
We two-timers, man.
We gonna get outta here, boy!

1066
01:52:26,201 --> 01:52:30,068
I'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high! Yes, sir!

1067
01:52:30,205 --> 01:52:32,244
Sergeant O'Neill!

1068
01:52:33,208 --> 01:52:35,366
- How are you doing?
- Just fine, sir.

1069
01:52:35,502 --> 01:52:37,743
That's good, cos you got second platoon.

1070
01:52:39,088 --> 01:52:40,915
Yes, sir.

1071
01:52:50,141 --> 01:52:52,217
- Ready?
- You bet.

1072
01:54:21,563 --> 01:54:25,097
I think now, looking back,

1073
01:54:25,233 --> 01:54:29,100
we did not fight the enemy,
we fought ourselves,

1074
01:54:29,237 --> 01:54:32,191
and the enemy... was in us.

1075
01:54:33,825 --> 01:54:35,983
The war is over for me now,

1076
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:40,994
but it will always be there,
for the rest of my days,

1077
01:54:41,123 --> 01:54:42,915
as I'm sure Elias will be,

1078
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:46,493
fighting with Barnes for what Rhah
called possession of my soul.

1079
01:54:48,547 --> 01:54:50,587
There are times since

1080
01:54:50,716 --> 01:54:54,215
I've felt like the child
born of those two fathers.

1081
01:54:57,222 --> 01:55:00,971
But be that as it may,
those of us who did make it

1082
01:55:01,101 --> 01:55:04,221
have an obligation to build again,

1083
01:55:04,354 --> 01:55:07,023
to teach to others what we know,

1084
01:55:07,566 --> 01:55:10,520
and to try with what's left of our lives

1085
01:55:10,652 --> 01:55:14,151
to find a goodness,
and meaning, to this life.

1086
01:55:15,151 --> 01:55:20,151
