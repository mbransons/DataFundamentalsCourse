1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,040
The day has come to bring down a tyrant!

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,040
Our lives are not worth living

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,160
if we don't have our freedom!

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's show Arvid
that he may take our lives,

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,640
but he can never take our freedom!

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,200
I mean, that whole thing about freedom

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,760
does not apply to you slaves, OK?

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,000
You are a breed of subhumans.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,720
And the whole thing about freedom

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,080
and the value of that,
that does not apply to you.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,600
Where was I?

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,760
Yeah.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,760
What we do in this life,

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,280
echoes in eternity!

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,680
Death to Arvid!

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,040
- Orm.
- Hm?

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,080
Just lay low, OK?

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,200
Let the plan unfold.

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Yes.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,480
I'm just so excited.

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,880
Yeah, I understand. But it's
very important just to stay focused.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,600
Because we are so near our goal.

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,800
I can practically smell Rome.

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,280
Rome...

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,120
The city that never sleeps.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,320
Yes.

27
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,040
OK.

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
They're here any minute now, so...

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
I guess you can lead the attack.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,920
Yeah. I mean, the commander
leads the attack. Yes.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
Yeah, so...

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,080
Are you going to set up a perimeter
and form a front?

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,240
Or what's your plan?

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,040
Hm?

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,480
Eh...
Your plan.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,520
Well, no, I'm...

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm the type of leader who, you know,

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,720
leads from further back.

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,040
That, you know,
gives me a better perspective.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,000
I can see the bigger picture, kind of.

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,440
I think the commander
is supposed to be at the front.

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,200
Yeah?
Actually no, not in a peasant army.

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,520
In a peasant army,
the commander is expected to have

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,720
a more passive role.

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,640
- OK?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,920
You realize you sort of have
a target on your back, right?

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you mean?

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
Well, you're new as a chieftain

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,840
and people might want to test you,
Jarl Varg and such people.

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,760
Yeah, I've thought about it.

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,120
I'll just keep my distance from Varg.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,400
- Then everything should be all right.
- OK?

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,320
It's like I always say:

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,640
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies a little farther away.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,640
Frøya, why don't you walk a while
back here, with your husband?

56
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,680
We're discussing allocations of tents,

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,320
and I told them
that we definitely want to sleep together.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,840
OK, I'll just be in the back here,
if you need me.

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,640
So you're just going to stay here
in hiding? That's your plan?

60
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,240
No!

61
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Everyone attacks when I blow this horn.

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
That's the plan.

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,680
Everyone but you.

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,000
You know what?
If you make sure you spend

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,400
anywhere near as much energy
on this ambush

66
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,880
as you do now
criticizing your commander,

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,160
this whole thing will go just great.

68
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,280
Arvid and his gang won't stand a chance.

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
So go find your place!

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,640
Huh?
Can you believe it?

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,680
Comes up here and tries to lecture me
on how to organize a peasant revolt?

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,920
I mean, I invented the peasant revolt!

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Lecturing me...
I'm lecturing him!

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,280
Man down!

75
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Shield wall!

76
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,080
Man down!

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,960
We're sitting ducks here!

78
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,960
Let me in!

79
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,560
Two lines!

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,480
Now!

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,320
I need a medicine man!

82
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,960
Were we just attacked?

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,960
Kind of seemed like it.

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,360
Orm?

85
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,600
Arvid...

86
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm so sorry.

87
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,400
For everything.

88
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,200
I'll see you on the other side.

89
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,600
Forgive me.

90
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,600
Well, don't just stand there!
Save him!

91
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Save him!

92
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
Hang in there, Orm.
It's gonna be OK.

93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,360
I don't think there's much
that needs to be saved.

94
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
What?

95
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,280
They didn't exactly use

96
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,320
live arrows.

97
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,200
Just the fact that it didn't cross their
minds that arrows need to be pointed.

98
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,840
I'm disappointed.
Orm, wake up.

99
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,600
No...

100
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,880
No, but I was seriously hit.

101
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,440
A mortal wound to the heart.

102
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,040
That's just...

103
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,800
It's so low.
It's sad.

104
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,040
I knew something strange was going on.

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,800
I got hit by many arrows,
but nothing happened.

106
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,840
Me too.
I felt immortal there for a moment.

107
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,640
Seriously, I think I was gone

108
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,000
for a few seconds.
It's like I was floating...

109
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,920
- You were sleeping.
- No, no.

110
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,840
If it isn't Eigil.

111
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,480
Congrats on a great peasant revolt.

112
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,880
I told you.
Waging war is a profession.

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,400
Arvid, I'm the first to admit that...

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
That you were right.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,960
I mean,
the art of war is not for everyone.

116
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,080
So this will not happen again.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,160
No.
It won't.

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
No...

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,200
Ragnar.
Ørn.

120
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,280
What's the point of this?
You've won already!

121
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
Arvid, this is the stupidest thing
you can do.

122
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,080
And why is that?

123
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Just because I'm the last surviving farmer
for miles around.

124
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,480
If something happens to me,
you will die of hunger.

125
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,880
Who's gonna give you food?

126
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,920
Who's gonna teach new farmers?
I mean, you have only me.

127
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
He's got a point.

128
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,320
Yeah.
I do.

129
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,080
Arvid.

130
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,600
If you look around,
you will see that I'm actually

131
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,960
the most important person here.

132
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,840
Ahem.

133
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,240
Huh?

134
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
Let's go.

135
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,960
Yes!

136
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,560
Hi there.
Good to see you.

137
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,720
Good to see you.

138
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
Nice to see you.

139
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,560
We are gathered here

140
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,760
for this meeting of the <i>landsthing</i>.

141
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
We come in peace.

142
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,120
And we leave

143
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,840
in peace.

144
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,600
Whomsoever violates

145
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
this <i>thing-</i>peace

146
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,440
will be declared

147
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
an outlaw.

148
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
Those who seek

149
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,320
to resolve disputes,

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,320
are asked to turn them in

151
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,160
now.

152
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,280
And I hereby declare

153
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,080
this <i>thing</i> open!

154
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,840
Frøya?

155
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,280
Can you

156
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,120
tickle my arm a little?

157
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,440
Ain't gonna happen.

158
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,240
No.

159
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
So.

160
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,320
I talked to the Thingman.

161
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,760
And it turns out that you, Arvid,
have been summoned.

162
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,600
- By Jarl Varg.
- What for?

163
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,240
He wants to lay claim to that map.

164
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,960
But I wouldn't worry.
You have a pretty solid case.

165
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,120
Yeah, I hope so.

166
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,760
- Just don't let Varg get to you.
- Of course.

167
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,160
If we violate the <i>thing-</i>peace,
we're in trouble.

168
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,040
I'll be cool as a cucumber.

169
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,800
You'll never get me agitated.

170
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,120
I actually have as a principle
never getting agitated.

171
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,840
But it's important you don't
come across as weak, either.

172
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,520
Don't let them run you over.
There's room for temperament.

173
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,720
Temperature is only healthy.

174
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,760
Just follow your instincts, Arvid,

175
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,800
and I'm sure this is going to be
totally painless.

176
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,480
- Be yourself.
- Everyone else is taken.

177
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,120
Arvid?

178
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,240
Just one thing.

179
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,040
- What are you doing?
- I gave you the Judas kiss.

180
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,240
- The what?
- The Judas kiss.

181
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,000
It's what Judas Iscariot
gave Jesus from Nazareth.

182
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,880
As a death sentence
and a definitive and final goodbye.

183
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,720
It was almost 800 years ago,
so no wonder you hadn't heard about it.

184
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
That was gross.
That is not OK.

185
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,040
That's almost sexual harassment.

186
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,400
Orm.

187
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,840
Don't tell him that.

188
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,560
He might get suspicious.

189
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,720
But if I hadn't told him, he would
have thought it was just a regular kiss.

190
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,560
Yes, but...

191
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,480
First

192
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,040
to the dispute between Jarl Varg

193
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,080
and chieftain Arvid of Norheim.

194
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,480
Regarding a promise given to Jarl Varg

195
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,520
by the deceased chieftain Olav.

196
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,280
Varg?

197
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,360
This is correct, your honor.

198
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,480
Chieftain Olav
was sent on a mission by me

199
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,240
to find a route to the West.

200
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,600
I was promised
that a map would be drawn up.

201
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,320
And handed over to me.

202
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,200
What do you have to say to that, Arvid?

203
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,800
What Jarl Varg says is true.

204
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,840
They had an agreement.

205
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,400
Then

206
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,520
Varg attacked Norheim.

207
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,720
And they ended up raping

208
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,760
the chieftain at the time.
Orm.

209
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,760
And you just don't rape chieftains

210
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,400
and demand maps in return.

211
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,240
That's just wrong.

212
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,840
At least that's my opinion.

213
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,200
- Is this true?
- Objection, your honor.

214
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,840
It may have started out as chieftain rape.

215
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,960
But the tables suddenly turned.

216
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,000
So that the chieftain

217
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,000
actually became the active part.

218
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,280
- OK?
- Yes.

219
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,440
The chieftain used fingers and tongue

220
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,360
and counter-humped so violently

221
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,240
that he went from

222
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,560
"ravishee" to "ravisher."

223
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,280
I think maybe that's enough.

224
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,880
So if anyone is to be accused
of being raped,

225
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,320
it has to be the original rapist.

226
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,800
Yes, because
I actually ended up raping him.

227
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,800
With my

228
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,560
anus.

229
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,720
So the answer to whether
the chieftain of Norheim was raped,

230
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,200
is a resounding no.

231
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,000
Fine.

232
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,360
- That sounds plausible.
- Absolutely.

233
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,200
But, Jarl Varg,

234
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,880
did you attack Norheim?

235
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,160
That's the only thing
we really need to know here.

236
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,280
Well, I suppose
some parts of it are true.

237
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,080
There were some disagreements
and some fairly gruesome murders.

238
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,200
Allow us to confer.

239
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
And we will return with our verdict.

240
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,480
The <i>thing</i> rules

241
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,040
in favor of

242
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,480
Chieftain Arvid!

243
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,600
He retains the right

244
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
to keep the map.

245
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,360
Allow me to introduce,

246
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,400
Chieftain Arvid

247
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,920
with a gift.

248
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,920
As a token of peace.

249
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,040
- Wow! A knife!
- Yes.

250
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
Check it out.

251
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,000
- Look at those details.
- Yes.

252
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,440
Thanks, Varg. I'll say...
It's awesome.

253
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
And you know what's funny?

254
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,480
It has a very special history.

255
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Yeah?
Cool.

256
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,520
- Perhaps you want to hear it?
- Yeah. Sure.

257
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,560
- Who's that?
- He's the leader of the nomads.

258
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,560
It was his knife.

259
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,800
Yes.

260
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,080
It was my knife.

261
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,080
And I stabbed it into your chieftain.

262
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,240
Until it met no more resistance.

263
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,200
And I really, really enjoyed it.

264
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,560
Isn't that fun, Arvid?

265
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,400
And here you are with the same knife.

266
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,160
He was tough

267
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,120
when he cut off my ear.

268
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,920
But he cried like a

269
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,680
baby

270
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,320
when he met that knife.

271
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,120
No!

272
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,280
Arvid violated the <i>thing-</i>peace!

273
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,400
He's an outlaw!

274
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,320
Run, Arvid!

275
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,000
Arvid is fair game.

276
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,880
It's everyone's duty to kill him.

277
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,160
Kill the walrus!

278
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,400
Shh!

279
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,440
Allow me to introduce myself.

280
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,720
My name

281
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,480
is Rufus of Rome.

282
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,760
I am Norheim's new Lawspeaker.

283
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,640
And I have an announcement to make.

284
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
Arvid violated the <i>thing-</i>peace

285
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,080
and is now an outlaw
for the rest of his life!

286
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,640
So it is up to me

287
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,880
to appoint the man
next in line to be Norheim's chieftain.

288
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
I give you...

289
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,400
Orm!

290
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,040
Proud and humble.

291
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,000
Proud and

292
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,800
humble.

293
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,720
I'm looking forward to
varied and exciting duties.

294
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's make Norheim great again!

295
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,360
To Valhalla!

296
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,440
If he wasn't crushed against the rocks,

297
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,120
he has guaranteed drowned.

298
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,560
Yeah.

299
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,760
No one could survive that.

300
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,880
But why are you lying on the ground?
You aren't afraid of heights, are you?

301
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,480
No, I'm not afraid of heights.

302
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,520
But when you're as tall as I am,

303
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,240
you end up looking extra far down.

304
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,480
So I prefer to lie on my stomach
when I'm looking from high places.

305
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,040
To be honest,
it looks like you're afraid of heights.

306
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,160
Yeah, it really does.

307
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,720
Yeah? Well, things aren't always
what they seem to be.

308
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,880
And in this case, it's the opposite.

309
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,360
It seems like I'm afraid of heights,

310
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,080
when in fact I love heights.

311
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,680
OK?

312
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,080
I prefer heights.

313
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,760
I love heights!

314
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,560
Yes, this is exciting!

315
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,560
So exciting.

316
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,840
I have many new plans for Norheim.

317
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,080
You have many new plans
for Norheim already?

318
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,560
When did you make those plans, Orm?

319
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,640
Just now.

320
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,160
Right after Arvid became an outlaw
and I became chieftain.

321
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,600
What's going on here?

322
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,760
Orm says he's got lots of new plans
for Norheim already.

323
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,200
Did you know about this, Orm?

324
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah.

325
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,920
Did I know in advance

326
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,680
about the terrible tragedy
that would take place here?

327
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,320
- Yeah.
- That's impossible!

328
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,880
It's just a little weird.

329
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,800
And now you have all these new plans.
I'd say it's a little suspicious.

330
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,520
No, I'm just a spontaneous type.
I'm constantly bubbling with ideas.

331
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,056
That's why I came up with
so many new plans in such a short time.

332
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,200
It's pretty strange when two former slaves

333
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,520
suddenly end up
as chieftain and Lawspeaker.

334
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,360
Stop it! Arvid knew very well
not to violate the<i> thing-</i>peace.

335
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,680
And yet he went ahead and did it anyway.

336
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,440
Embarrassed us all.
And you suspect Orm?

337
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,200
Shame on you.

338
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,040
Shame on you!

339
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,120
Rufus.

340
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,960
Orm.

341
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,600
If I find out that you have
anything to do with this,

342
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,320
your tiny little cocks

343
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,600
are gonna hang

344
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,920
around my neck.

345
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,640
Well, that's not gonna happen

346
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,760
because we
didn't have anything to do with it.

347
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,640
It's

348
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,560
absurd.

349
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,960
It's just... untrue.

350
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,640
Hurtful.

351
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,800
But there you go.

352
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,400
You don't think we should climb down
and check if his body's there?

353
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,680
No.
No way.

354
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,160
But isn't that a classic mistake?

355
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,840
To assume someone's dead
and then they turn out to be alive?

356
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,800
And they come back
to take revenge and all that?

357
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,680
Yeah, that's a classic mistake.

358
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,640
But there's no doubt that he's dead,
so we'll skip it.

359
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,160
OK.
Whatever.

360
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,880
Climb down there?
We haven't got safety equipment.

361
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,520
I think Jarl Varg
would get very disappointed

362
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,320
if he heard
that we gambled with our lives like that.

363
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,120
So the answer to that

364
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,160
is no.

365
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,040
OK...

366
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,560
Orm!

367
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,880
Jarl Varg.

368
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,240
Out and about.

369
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,920
We are leaving now.

370
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,920
I just want to say I look forward
to working closely with you.

371
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,840
You're gonna work closely?

372
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,560
Silence!

373
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,600
You hand robber.

374
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,280
What?

375
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,960
He probably says that to everyone.

376
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,600
It's perfectly normal
for members of the social elite

377
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,480
to work together on major issues.

378
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,680
- So that's probably what he means.
- Really?

379
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,840
My condolences regarding
that pregnant pig of yours.

380
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,200
Apparently he was crushed
against some rocks.

381
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,920
- What?!
- Yes.

382
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,560
I hear he threw himself off of a cliff.

383
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,960
Hoping he would bounce up again.
But...

384
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,160
I guess that's not the way
blubber works.

385
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,880
May he rest in shit.

386
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,280
Hold your horses.

387
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,880
Hold your horses...

388
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,480
It would be a shame

389
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,840
if two became outlaws here today.

390
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

391
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,240
Yeah...

392
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,920
What's happened?

393
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,560
Where's Arvid?

394
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,200
Ta-da!

395
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,800
Ta-da?
What does that mean?

396
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,080
It's sort of an oral fanfare
to introduce the new chieftain.

397
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,160
- Who is...?
- That is me.

398
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,280
Arvid managed the feat
of attacking someone at the<i> thing.</i>

399
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,200
So he became an outlaw, unfortunately.

400
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,920
- Huh?
- Yes, and then he was killed.

401
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,680
By Varg's men.

402
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,440
So heaven has gotten a new star,
in a way.

403
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,120
- Is Arvid dead?
- Yes.

404
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,760
My condolences.

405
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,520
By Loki!

406
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,960
By Loki...

407
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
My heart is crushed.

408
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Can't even speak,
I'm grieving so badly.

409
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,960
He was the love of my life.

410
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,360
My heart's crushed.

411
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,800
Sure it is.

412
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,280
Yes, I guess that means that
you no longer are living in the longhouse.

413
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,920
Since you're not the chieftain's wife.
Frøya is. Isn't that how the rule works?

414
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,320
But I'm in the middle of
a grieving process here.

415
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,080
- Are you?
- Mhm.

416
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,440
Frøya, now we have to be strong together.

417
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,400
Come, Frøya.

418
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,920
Real mature, Frøya!

419
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,960
Real mature behavior.

420
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,480
My lovely wife!
My children!

421
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,160
Hi. What's going on?
Where's the peasant army?

422
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,760
- They're in Valhalla.
- Huh?

423
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Or a similar place where peasants go
when they die in battle.

424
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,880
Die in battle?
Are they all dead?

425
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,920
- Yup.
- What?

426
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,800
But...
And that's tragic.

427
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,920
But the good thing is, I survived!

428
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,040
And that's where we put our focus now.
So...

429
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,720
OK, when is Arvid going to come here
and ravish me

430
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,520
and take the kids
and burn the house to the ground?

431
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,880
That's the thing. That's the work
of genius. It's not gonna happen!

432
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,200
Because we are the only
surviving peasants for miles around.

433
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,480
They are completely dependent on us.
We drew the winning ticket here.

434
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,240
Apart, of course, from the fact
that everyone we know died.

435
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,560
But, you know...

436
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,600
- That is amazing, Eigil!
- Yes, it is.

437
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,280
It couldn't be better.
We are invulnerable.

438
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,120
Torstein, my faithful brother-in-arms.

439
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,520
You didn't understand
the domino reference?

440
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,440
I'm sorry. My head kind of overheated
when you explained it.

441
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,640
It's probably not that hard
once you learn it.

442
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,560
It's very easy, my friend.

443
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,280
You line up the pieces like this.

444
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,520
And when you push the first one,

445
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
the other ones fall.

446
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,640
But you...

447
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,320
You've got three pieces there.

448
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,920
Haven't we gotten rid of
everyone we need to get rid of?

449
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,280
You think I like these
better than my old hands?

450
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,760
No.

451
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,080
When we return to Norheim,

452
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,680
the third domino shall fall!
