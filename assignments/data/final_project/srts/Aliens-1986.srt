1
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:23,535
Sir, we got
the CPU on-line. No problem.

2
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:25,913
Good. Stand by in Operations.

3
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:29,374
OK, let's go.

4
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:51,396
Are you all right?

5
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:54,274
Yes.

6
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,625
Sir...

7
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:15,629
they sealed off this wing at
both ends, welded the doors...

8
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:19,007
and blocked off the stairs
with heavy equipment.

9
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,010
But it looks like
the barricade didn't hold.

10
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,555
-Any bodies?
-No, sir.

11
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,515
Last stand.

12
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:28,100
Must have been
a hell of a fight.

13
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:31,061
Looks that way.

14
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:35,732
All right, Drake, this way.

15
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:38,902
We should be able to cut through
the med lab to Operations.

16
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:31,622
Lieutenant.

17
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,542
Gorman.

18
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:55,062
Are those the same ones?

19
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:09,326
Careful, Burke.

20
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,589
Looks like
love at first sight to me.

21
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:25,968
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

22
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:28,971
Two are alive.
The rest are dead.

23
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:33,851
"Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

24
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:37,980
"Subject Marachuk, John J.,
died during the procedure."

25
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:41,150
They killed him taking it off.

26
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:44,611
Yo, Hicks.

27
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:47,781
I think we got something here.

28
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:53,829
Behind us.

29
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:55,914
One of us?

30
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:57,833
Apone, where are your people?

31
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,543
Anybody in D-Block?

32
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,004
Negative.
We're all in Operations.

33
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,384
Talk to me, Frosty.

34
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,511
Let's keep moving, baby.

35
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:28,489
It's moving.

36
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,907
Which way?

37
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:31,909
It's coming straight for us.

38
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,452
Straight up.

39
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:11,824
Fuck!

40
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:13,534
Hold up.

41
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,161
Ripley.

42
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:38,517
Hey, shh, it's all right.

43
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:39,893
It's all right.

44
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:41,145
Grab her, Corporal.

45
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:44,481
Don't be afraid.
Come on. We won't hurt you.

46
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:46,900
Shh. It's all right. It's OK.

47
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:50,154
Come on out. Come on. Easy.

48
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,781
I got her. Ow! Damn!

49
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,491
Don't let her go.

50
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:55,951
She's under the grill!

51
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:57,661
Frost, get your light up here.

52
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,204
Where'd she go?

53
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:02,249
She's on the other side.

54
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,376
Shine the light!

55
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,921
Here. Here.

56
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,632
Keep back. Don't scare her.

57
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,301
Grab her. We're gonna lose her.

58
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:14,219
Damn it!

59
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,894
Wait.

60
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,339
It's OK. It's all right.

61
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,217
Don't be afraid.

62
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:56,178
See?

63
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,389
Wait. No, you don't.

64
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:01,683
It's OK.

65
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,769
You're gonna be all right now.

66
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:05,103
Shh.

67
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:09,316
Easy. Easy.
It's gonna be OK.

68
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:11,443
It's all right.
You're gonna be OK.

69
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,071
Shh, shh, shh.

70
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:16,824
Easy. Easy.

71
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:54,862
What's her name again?

72
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:56,155
Rebecca.

73
00:07:56,196 --> 00:08:00,117
Now think, Rebecca.
Concentrate.

74
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,494
Just start at the beginning.

75
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:04,496
Where are your parents?

76
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,124
Look, Rebecca, you have to try-

77
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,794
Gorman, give it a rest,
why don't you?

78
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:16,049
Total brainlock.

79
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,093
Physically, she's OK.

80
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:21,305
Borderline malnutrition,
but no permanent damage.

81
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:23,348
Come on. We're wasting time.

82
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:34,526
Try this.

83
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,988
It's a little hot chocolate.

84
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:40,699
There you go.

85
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,035
Whoop.

86
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:46,079
That good, huh?

87
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:52,085
Uh-oh.

88
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,296
I made a clean spot here.

89
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:55,756
Now I've done it.

90
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:58,050
Guess I'll have to do
the whole thing.

91
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:10,979
Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

92
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:14,274
And a pretty one, too.

93
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,907
You don't talk much, do you?

94
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,043
Smoking or non-smoking?

95
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:35,045
Tell me what
you're scanning for.

96
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:36,880
PDTs.

97
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:38,882
Personal data transmitters.

98
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:41,510
Every colonist had one
surgically implanted.

99
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:44,805
If they're within twenty klicks,
we'll read it out here.

100
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:47,015
So far, zippo.

101
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:49,935
I don't know how you
stayed alive...

102
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:52,437
but you're one brave kid,
Rebecca.

103
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,400
Newt.

104
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:59,695
What'd you say?

105
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:01,530
Newt.

106
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,991
My name's Newt.

107
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:09,037
Nobody calls me Rebecca
except my brother.

108
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,039
Newt.

109
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:12,708
I like that.

110
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:14,418
I'm Ripley.

111
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,254
It's nice to meet you.

112
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:22,342
And who is this, hmm?

113
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,178
Casey.

114
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,221
Hello, Casey.

115
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:29,266
What about your brother?
What's his name?

116
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:30,851
Timmy.

117
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:33,687
Is Timmy around here, too?

118
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,898
Maybe hiding like you were?

119
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:40,861
Any sisters?

120
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,492
Mom and Dad?

121
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:52,372
Newt, look at me.

122
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:53,624
Where are they?

123
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:56,668
They're dead, all right?
Can I go now?

124
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,173
I'm sorry, Newt.

125
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:04,885
Don't you think you'd be safer
here with us?

126
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,933
These people are here
to protect you.

127
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,893
They're soldiers.

128
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:15,813
It won't make any difference.

129
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:31,370
Need anything else?

130
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,834
Hello, Bishop.
Do you need anything else?

131
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,212
No.

132
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,008
Nice pet you got there.

133
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,178
Magnificent, isn't it?

134
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:51,682
Yo! Stop your grinnin'
and drop your linen!

135
00:11:51,723 --> 00:11:53,308
Found them.

136
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,560
They alive?

137
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:57,896
Unknown, but it looks
like all of them...

138
00:11:57,938 --> 00:12:00,357
over at
the processing station...

139
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,192
sub-level three...

140
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:04,695
under the main cooling towers.

141
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:08,532
It looks like
a goddamn town meeting.

142
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:10,284
Let's saddle up, Apone.

143
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:11,660
Aye, sir.

144
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:17,791
Let's go. They ain't payin' us
by the hour. Head 'em out.

145
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,710
OK, Frost, you're driving.

146
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:34,892
It's OK. Don't worry.
It'll be OK.

147
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,601
I want
a straight "V" deployment...

148
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,770
second team on left flank.

149
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,064
Advance on axial six-six-four.

150
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:26,735
Tracker on-line. Set the V-gain
to filter R-F ambient.

151
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:30,531
Hudson, tracker on-line.
Left and right, little buddy.

152
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:34,159
Forty meters in,
bearing two-two-one...

153
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:36,578
there should be a stairwell.

154
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,913
Check. Got it.

155
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,917
You want sub-level three.

156
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,170
Let's go, people.

157
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:46,839
Hudson, you got the point.

158
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,674
Hicks, watch our tails.

159
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:50,676
Nice and easy.

160
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:52,052
Check those corners.

161
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:54,096
Check those corners.

162
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,393
Watch your spacing.

163
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:02,312
You heard the man.
Don't bunch up. Stay loose.

164
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:05,315
Your transmission's
showing a lot of break-up.

165
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:08,026
Probably getting some
interference from the structure.

166
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,570
Use those lights.

167
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:16,326
Next one down,
and proceed on a two-one-six.

168
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:18,412
Roger.
That's a two-one-six.

169
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:22,249
I'm not
making that out too well.

170
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,168
What is it, Hudson?

171
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:26,837
You tell me. I only work here.

172
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,937
What is that?

173
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:46,190
I don't know.

174
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,151
Proceed inside.

175
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,629
Watch your fire
and check your targets.

176
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,173
Remember, we're looking
for civvies in here.

177
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:22,684
Easy.

178
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:25,687
Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.

179
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:29,066
Nice and easy.

180
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:33,904
Looks like
some sort of secreted resin.

181
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:37,741
Yeah, but secreted from what?

182
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:40,536
Nobody touch nothing.

183
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:43,580
Busy little creatures, huh?

184
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:45,916
Hot as hell in here.

185
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,668
But it's a dry heat.

186
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,378
Knock it off, Hudson.

187
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,806
Lieutenant,
what do those pulse-rifles fire?

188
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,684
Ten millimeter
explosive-tip caseless.

189
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,811
Standard light
armor-piercing round. Why?

190
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:08,021
Look where your team is.

191
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:11,233
They're right under
the primary heat exchangers.

192
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,401
So?

193
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:15,988
So if they fire their weapons
in there...

194
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:17,281
won't they rupture
the cooling system?

195
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:20,325
Oh, ho ho. Yeah.
She's absolutely right.

196
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,618
So what?

197
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,914
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor.

198
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:28,375
Right?

199
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,336
So she's talking about
a thermonuclear explosion...

200
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:33,130
and, "Adiós, muchachos."

201
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,799
Oh, great. Wonderful.

202
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:38,385
Shit!

203
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:41,847
Look.

204
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:44,475
Uh...Apone.

205
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:49,396
We can't have any firing
in there.

206
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:53,066
I want you to collect
magazines from everybody.

207
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:54,610
Is he fuckin' crazy?

208
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,237
What do we use, harsh language?

209
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,198
Flame units only.
I want rifles slung.

210
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,407
Sir, l-

211
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:03,160
Just do it, Sergeant.
And no grenades.

212
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:06,663
You heard the man.

213
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:08,916
Pull 'em out. Let's have 'em.

214
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,336
Come on, Vasquez.
Clear and lock.

215
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,007
Damn!

216
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,052
You, too. Give it up, Ski.

217
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:23,096
Crowe, I want it now.
Give it up.

218
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:24,556
Right on, Vas.

219
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,352
Let's go. Give it up.

220
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,521
Frost, you got the duty.
Open that bag.

221
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:32,147
Thanks a lot, Sarge.

222
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:33,565
Hicks, cover our ass.

223
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:35,442
Head 'em out, people.

224
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:41,323
I like to keep this handy
for close encounters.

225
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:43,200
I heard that.

226
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,002
Any movement?

227
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:55,504
Nothing.

228
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:56,755
Zip.

229
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:12,187
Holy shit.

230
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,244
Newt, go sit up front.

231
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:28,579
Go on!

232
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,872
Now!

233
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:01,153
Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

234
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:04,573
We're still Marines,
and we got a job to do.

235
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,074
Keep it moving.

236
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:08,452
Easy.

237
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,110
-Top!
-What?

238
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:43,821
We got a live one!

239
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,322
You're gonna be all right.

240
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:48,200
Please...kill me.

241
00:19:48,242 --> 00:19:50,160
Stay calm. We'll get you out.

242
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,371
It's gonna be all right.

243
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:54,122
We've got to get her
out of here.

244
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:55,415
What is it, Dietrich?
What's going on?

245
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:56,959
Convulsion!

246
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,126
Ohh!

247
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:00,420
Dietrich, get back!

248
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,172
Aah! Aah!

249
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:09,888
No!

250
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,974
Frost, flamethrower!

251
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:14,601
Get back! Flamethrower! Move!

252
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:46,175
-Movement!

253
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:47,342
What's the position?

254
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:51,096
I can't lock in!

255
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:53,474
Talk to me, Hudson!

256
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:55,976
Multiple signals.

257
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:57,644
They're closing.

258
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:02,316
Go to infrared, people.
Look sharp!

259
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:05,611
What's happening, Apone?
We can't see anything in here.

260
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:07,696
Pull your team out, Gorman.

261
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:16,330
I got readings
in front and behind.

262
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:18,749
Where, man?
I don't see shit.

263
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:21,210
He's right.
Nothing's back here.

264
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:23,712
Something's moving,
and it ain't us!

265
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:26,673
Oh, shit.

266
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:28,634
Tracker's off-scale, man.

267
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:31,970
They're all around us, man!
Jesus!

268
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:35,349
Maybe they don't
show up on infrared at all.

269
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:40,854
Aah!

270
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:43,816
Aah!

271
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:46,318
Frost!

272
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,820
Aah!

273
00:21:52,115 --> 00:21:54,034
Come on!

274
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:00,374
Aah!

275
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:03,001
Jesus Christ, Apone!
What is going on?

276
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:05,295
Wierzbowski
and Crowe are down!

277
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:09,424
Dietrich, Crowe! Sound off!

278
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:12,261
Frost! Frost!

279
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:15,931
Aah!

280
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:18,100
Wierzbowski!

281
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:19,351
Wierzbowski!

282
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:20,936
Aah!

283
00:22:20,978 --> 00:22:22,938
Let's rock!

284
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,606
Yeah!

285
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:27,401
Yeah!

286
00:22:27,442 --> 00:22:28,944
Who's firing? God damn it!

287
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:31,280
Yeah!

288
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:32,823
I ordered a hold fire.

289
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:37,786
They're coming out of
the goddamn walls! Let's book!

290
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:39,872
Uh, Apone...

291
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:42,958
I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with...

292
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,919
Vasquez, Drake,
hold your fire, God damn it!

293
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:47,838
Are you copying me?

294
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,174
Lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators...

295
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:51,675
and fall back by squads...

296
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:52,968
Say again?

297
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,887
All after "incinerator."

298
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:58,974
Lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators...

299
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:00,350
and fall back...

300
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:06,148
Aah!

301
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,316
Sarge!

302
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:10,611
Apone, talk to me.

303
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:12,279
Apone? Talk to me!

304
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:13,489
He's gone!

305
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:17,618
Get them out of there!

306
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,411
Shut up!

307
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:21,205
Hicks, whoever's left,
get the hell-

308
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,623
-Shut up!
-God damn it!

309
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:26,001
Where's Apone?!

310
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:27,169
Where's Apone?!

311
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:30,631
The Sarge is gone!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

312
00:23:30,672 --> 00:23:32,299
Let's go, Marines!

313
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:34,927
Hudson?

314
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,595
Vasquez?

315
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:38,430
Hudson, look out!

316
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:39,765
Get it!

317
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:42,392
Hudson!

318
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:43,894
Hicks! Hicks!

319
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:45,646
It's too much!
Fall back!

320
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,773
I told them to fall back.

321
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:48,982
I told them to fall back.

322
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:51,026
They're cut off!

323
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:53,153
Do something!

324
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:54,947
Fuck!

325
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:56,156
Keep movin'!

326
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:58,033
Hold on, Newt.

327
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:07,000
Ripley,
what the hell are you doing?

328
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:14,591
Turn around!

329
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:19,471
That's an order!

330
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:25,936
Get off me, damn it!

331
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:27,479
God damn it, that's an order!

332
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:29,189
You had your chance, Gorman.

333
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:42,953
Come on!

334
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:44,454
Come on, Drake!

335
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:02,973
Yeah!

336
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:04,600
Let's move it!

337
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:08,145
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

338
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:11,690
It's blocked, man.
We got to go around!

339
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:13,400
Open the door! Hicks!

340
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:16,028
Drake, we are leaving!

341
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,200
Run for it!

342
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,328
Shit!

343
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,126
Let's go!

344
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:32,795
Drake, come on, man!

345
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:40,928
Drake, come on!

346
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:46,809
Aah!

347
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,352
No!

348
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:52,272
Fire in the hold!

349
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:53,565
He's gone!

350
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:55,192
No! Drake's out there!

351
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:56,860
Put it out!

352
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,570
Drake's coming!

353
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,489
He's gone!

354
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:01,990
No, he's not!

355
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,410
Forget him ! He's gone!

356
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:13,043
Get on the goddamn door!

357
00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:17,589
Eat this!

358
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,343
Aah!

359
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:24,847
Ripley! Go, go, go!

360
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:36,608
Whoa!

361
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:49,079
Oh.

362
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,536
It's all right! We're clear!

363
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:32,539
Ripley,
you've blown the transaxle!

364
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:34,541
You're just grinding metal!

365
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,668
Come on, ease down.

366
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,545
Ease down.

367
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:39,755
Ease down.

368
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:42,382
Ease down.

369
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:55,312
You OK?

370
00:27:57,147 --> 00:27:59,107
I'm all right.

371
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:02,319
Get away from me, man!

372
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,779
Lieutenant.

373
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:06,198
What happened to Gorman?

374
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,491
I don't know...

375
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,827
maybe a concussion,
but he's alive.

376
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:11,703
No, man, he's dead!

377
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:13,997
Wake up, pendejo!
I'm going to kill you!

378
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,541
Back off.

379
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,042
Right now.

380
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:21,839
Somebody get me a first aid kit.

381
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,008
Hey. Hey, look.

382
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,553
The Sarge and Dietrich
aren't dead, man.

383
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:30,514
Their signs are real low,
but they ain't dead.

384
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:31,932
Then we get them.

385
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:34,226
-We don't leave people behind!
-I ain't going back!

386
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:36,228
You can't help them !

387
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:39,398
You can't.

388
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:42,568
Right now they're being cocooned
just like the others.

389
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,032
Oh, dear Lord Jesus,
this ain't happenin', man.

390
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:50,576
God damn it.

391
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:53,078
This can't be happenin', man.

392
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:54,329
This isn't happenin'!

393
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:57,541
We've got
seven canisters of CN-20.

394
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:01,545
I say we roll them in there
and nerve gas the whole nest.

395
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:04,548
It's worth a try, but we
don't know if it'll affect them.

396
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,719
Let's bug out and call
it even. Why even talk about it?

397
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,556
I say we take off and
nuke the entire site from orbit.

398
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,394
It's the only way to be sure.

399
00:29:17,436 --> 00:29:19,021
Fuckin' "A"!

400
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:20,731
Hold on one second.

401
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:24,985
This installation
has a substantial dollar value.

402
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:26,445
They can bill me.

403
00:29:27,821 --> 00:29:29,031
OK, look.

404
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:32,534
This is an emotional moment
for all of us, OK?

405
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:33,702
I know that.

406
00:29:33,744 --> 00:29:36,538
But let's not make
snap judgments, please.

407
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,625
This is clearly an important
species we're dealing with...

408
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:42,419
and I don't think you or I
or anybody has the right...

409
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:44,046
to arbitrarily exterminate them.

410
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:45,255
Wrong.

411
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:46,924
Yeah. Watch us.

412
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:49,468
Maybe you haven't been
keeping up on current events...

413
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,012
but we just got
our asses kicked, pal!

414
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:55,557
I'm not blind
to what's going on...

415
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,269
but I cannot authorize that kind
of action. I'm sorry.

416
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:06,360
Well, I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.

417
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:09,655
Corporal Hicks is...

418
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:12,366
This operation
is under military jurisdiction.

419
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:15,619
Hicks is next in chain
of command, right, Corporal?

420
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:18,163
Yeah.

421
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,208
Yeah, that's right.

422
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:24,253
Yeah. Look, Ripley...

423
00:30:24,294 --> 00:30:26,588
this is a multimillion dollar
installation, OK?

424
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,175
He can't make that decision.
He's just a grunt.

425
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:31,635
Uh, no offense.

426
00:30:31,677 --> 00:30:33,095
None taken.

427
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,596
Ferro, do you copy?

428
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:35,764
Standing by.

429
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:38,183
Prep for dust-off.
We need immediate evac.

430
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:40,102
Roger. On our way.

431
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:43,272
I say we take off,
nuke the site from orbit.

432
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:44,898
It's the only way to be sure.

433
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:49,278
Let's do it.

434
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:58,370
Let's go.
Pick it up, Hudson.

435
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,164
Pick it up, baby.

436
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:07,337
All right. Set him down here.

437
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:15,929
Move it, Spunkmeyer.
We're rolling.

438
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:23,520
Hold on a second.
There's something-

439
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,522
Just get up here.

440
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,983
I'm in. Ramp closing.

441
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:50,297
Spunkmeyer.

442
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,049
God damn it.

443
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:56,929
Well, where the fuck-

444
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,859
Run!

445
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:55,821
Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.

446
00:32:55,863 --> 00:32:58,866
Now what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

447
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:01,326
We're in some real
pretty shit now, man!

448
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:02,494
Are you finished?

449
00:33:06,373 --> 00:33:08,041
You all right?

450
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:17,843
I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?

451
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:19,178
I'm sorry, Newt.

452
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:22,764
You don't have to be sorry.
It wasn't your fault.

453
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:25,267
That's it, man.
Game over, man! Game over!

454
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,519
What the fuck
are we gonna do now?

455
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:29,021
What are we gonna do?

456
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:32,024
Maybe we could build
a fire, sing a couple of songs.

457
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:33,525
Why don't we try that?

458
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:36,361
We'd better get back
'cause it'll be dark soon...

459
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:38,030
and they mostly come at night.

460
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,406
Mostly.

461
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,549
That's everything, right?

462
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:00,761
This is absolutely everything
we could salvage...

463
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:03,263
out of the APC wreckage.

464
00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:07,226
We got four pulse-rifles
with about fifty rounds each.

465
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:09,269
That ain't so good.

466
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:12,731
We got fifteen
of these M-40 grenades.

467
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:16,276
Don't touch that.
Dangerous, honey.

468
00:34:16,318 --> 00:34:17,736
Is that the only flamethrower?

469
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,865
Yeah. It's only
half-full, but it's functional.

470
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:23,492
And another one's damaged.

471
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:25,702
I don't know about that one.

472
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:27,996
But the good news...

473
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:30,582
we got four of these
robot sentries...

474
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,711
with display
and scanners intact.

475
00:34:34,753 --> 00:34:37,714
They really kick ass.
They'll come in handy.

476
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:41,426
How long after we're declared
overdue can we expect a rescue?

477
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:46,640
Seventeen days.

478
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:49,017
Seventeen days?

479
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:52,020
Hey, man, I don't wanna
rain on your parade...

480
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:54,148
but we're not gonna last
seventeen hours.

481
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:57,901
Those things are gonna come here
like they did before, and-

482
00:34:57,943 --> 00:35:00,112
Hudson! Hudson!

483
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:03,490
This little girl
survived longer than that...

484
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,868
with no weapons and no training.

485
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,327
Right?

486
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:12,791
Why don't you put her in charge?

487
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,585
You better just start
dealing with it, Hudson.

488
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:18,589
Deal with it,
because we need you...

489
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,632
and I'm sick of your bullshit.

490
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:25,262
Now get on a terminal
and call up a floor plan file.

491
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:27,139
Construction blueprints.
I don't care.

492
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:28,807
Anything that shows the layout.

493
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,101
-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

494
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:34,521
I need to see air ducts,
electrical access tunnels...

495
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:36,148
sub-basements...

496
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,525
every possible way
into this complex.

497
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:41,862
We don't have much time.

498
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:43,280
OK.

499
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:45,699
OK, I'm on it.

500
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:46,909
Hudson!

501
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,660
Just relax.

502
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,585
I'll be in med lab.

503
00:35:57,169 --> 00:36:00,130
I'll check on Gorman,
continue my analysis.

504
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:01,548
Fine.

505
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,425
You do that.

506
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:10,599
This service tunnel...

507
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:13,185
must be how
they're moving back and forth.

508
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:14,353
That's right.

509
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:15,854
It moves from
the processing station...

510
00:36:15,896 --> 00:36:18,357
right into the sub-level.

511
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:21,401
Come down on that.

512
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:23,654
OK, come over.

513
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:25,155
Hold it. Go back.

514
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:26,698
Punch that in there.

515
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:33,372
No. It's back here.

516
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:34,581
OK.

517
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,794
There's a pressure door
at this end.

518
00:36:38,836 --> 00:36:42,506
Couldn't we put a remote
sentry unit in the tunnel...

519
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:43,841
then seal that door?

520
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:45,050
That'll work...

521
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:47,511
but we gotta figure on them
getting into the complex.

522
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:48,762
That's right, so...

523
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:51,515
we repair the barricades
at these two intersections...

524
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:52,724
Right.

525
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:56,520
...and weld plate steel over
these ducts here and here...

526
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,313
and here.

527
00:36:58,355 --> 00:37:01,942
Then they can only come at us
from these two corridors.

528
00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:06,071
Right. Then we put
the other sentry units here...

529
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:07,781
and here, right?

530
00:37:07,823 --> 00:37:09,449
-Right.
-Outstanding.

531
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:12,411
Now all we need
is a deck of cards.

532
00:37:14,496 --> 00:37:16,832
Let's move
like we've got a purpose.

533
00:37:16,874 --> 00:37:18,333
Affirmative.

534
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,877
Affirmative.

535
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:36,727
Do your thing, baby.

536
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:39,313
Come on, Vasquez,
let's get out of here.

537
00:37:39,354 --> 00:37:41,732
"A" and "B" sentries
are in place and keyed.

538
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,985
Roger.
Stand by. Arming now.

539
00:37:44,985 --> 00:37:46,528
Test it, Hudson.

540
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,989
-Do it.
-Fire in the hole!

541
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:55,245
Great.
Let's get the hell out of here.

542
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:57,080
We're sealing the tunnel.

543
00:37:57,122 --> 00:37:58,499
Come on, baby.

544
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:12,137
For what it's worth.

545
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:16,850
I want you to put this on.

546
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:19,228
What's it for?

547
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,479
It's a locator.

548
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:24,107
Then I can find you anywhere
in the complex on this.

549
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:27,486
It's just a precaution.

550
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:29,988
Thanks.

551
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,991
Doesn't mean we're engaged
or anything.

552
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:34,952
All right, what's next?

553
00:39:04,231 --> 00:39:05,732
Last stop.

554
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:11,738
Get in.

555
00:39:11,738 --> 00:39:13,740
Scoot down.

556
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:16,743
That's good.

557
00:39:16,743 --> 00:39:19,329
Now lie here and have a nap.

558
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:20,831
You're very tired.

559
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:24,209
I don't want to.
I have scary dreams.

560
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:29,840
Well, I bet Casey
doesn't have scary dreams.

561
00:39:29,882 --> 00:39:31,842
Let's take a look.

562
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:34,219
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

563
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:35,512
See?

564
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:37,931
Maybe you could just
try to be like her.

565
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:41,351
Ripley, she doesn't
have bad dreams...

566
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:44,313
because she's just
a piece of plastic.

567
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:46,064
Right.

568
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:48,066
I'm sorry, Newt.

569
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,241
There.

570
00:39:56,283 --> 00:39:59,787
My mommy always said
there were no monsters...

571
00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:03,207
no real ones, but there are.

572
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:06,460
Yes, there are, aren't there?

573
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:10,923
Why do they tell
little kids that?

574
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:14,718
Most of the time it's true.

575
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,222
Did one of those things
grow inside her?

576
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:20,974
I don't know, Newt.

577
00:40:21,016 --> 00:40:23,185
That's the truth.

578
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:25,646
Isn't that how babies come-

579
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:27,898
I mean, people babies?

580
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,483
They grow inside you.

581
00:40:29,525 --> 00:40:31,485
No. That's very different.

582
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:33,487
Did you ever have a baby?

583
00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:34,988
Yes, I did.

584
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,990
I had a little girl.

585
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,992
Where is she?

586
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:41,578
She's gone.

587
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:45,290
You mean dead.

588
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,252
Here.

589
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:51,255
Take this.

590
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:54,299
For luck.

591
00:40:57,553 --> 00:40:59,054
How's that?

592
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:03,725
Don't go, please.

593
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,145
Newt, I'm gonna be
right in the next room.

594
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:09,481
And you see that camera?

595
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:12,359
I can see you
through that camera...

596
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:14,653
to see if you're safe.

597
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:21,827
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

598
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:24,163
I mean that.

599
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:25,831
That's a promise.

600
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:27,458
You promise?

601
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:30,961
I cross my heart.

602
00:41:31,003 --> 00:41:32,754
And hope to die?

603
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:35,340
And hope to die.

604
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:51,607
Now go to sleep...

605
00:41:51,648 --> 00:41:54,693
and don't dream.

606
00:41:58,614 --> 00:41:59,990
Sneak.

607
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,460
The molecular acid oxidizes...

608
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:13,712
after the creature's death,
completely neutralizing it.

609
00:42:13,754 --> 00:42:17,466
Bishop, that's interesting,
but it gets us nowhere.

610
00:42:17,508 --> 00:42:19,968
I'm trying to figure out
what we're dealing with.

611
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,470
Let's go through it again.

612
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:24,473
They grab the colonists,
they move them over there...

613
00:42:24,515 --> 00:42:28,477
and they immobilize them
to be hosts for more of these.

614
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:32,147
Which means there would have
to be a lot of these parasites.

615
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:35,025
One for each colonist.
That's over a hundred, at least.

616
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:37,027
Yes. That follows.

617
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:40,864
Each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

618
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:45,619
So who's laying these eggs?

619
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:48,080
I'm not sure.

620
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:50,833
It must be something
we haven't seen yet.

621
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:53,168
Hey, maybe
it's like an ant hive.

622
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,505
-Bees have hives.
-You know what I mean.

623
00:42:56,547 --> 00:42:59,508
There's, like, one female
that runs the whole show.

624
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,426
Yes. The queen.

625
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:02,970
Yeah. The mama.

626
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:05,472
And she's badass, man.
I mean big.

627
00:43:05,472 --> 00:43:08,058
-These things ain't ants.
-I know that.

628
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:11,937
Bishop, I want
these specimens destroyed...

629
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:13,897
as soon as
you're finished with them.

630
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:16,066
Mr. Burke gave instructions...

631
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:19,736
they were to be kept alive
for return to the Company labs.

632
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:25,159
He was very specific about it.

633
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,453
Those two specimens
are worth millions...

634
00:43:27,494 --> 00:43:29,496
to the bio-weapons division.

635
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:33,083
If you're smart, we can both
come out of this heroes...

636
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:36,003
and we will be set up for life.

637
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:39,089
You're crazy, Burke.
Do you know that?

638
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:41,800
Do you think you can get
a dangerous organism...

639
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:43,510
past ICC quarantine?

640
00:43:43,552 --> 00:43:47,014
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

641
00:43:47,014 --> 00:43:50,058
But they will know
about it, Burke. From me.

642
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,019
Just like they'll know
you were responsible...

643
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,313
for the deaths of one hundred
fifty-seven colonists.

644
00:43:54,354 --> 00:43:55,481
Wait a second!

645
00:43:55,522 --> 00:43:57,524
-You sent them to that ship.
-You're wrong.

646
00:43:57,524 --> 00:43:59,359
I just checked
the colony log...

647
00:43:59,401 --> 00:44:02,946
directive dated 6-12-79,
signed Burke, Carter J.

648
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:05,949
You sent them out there
and didn't even warn them.

649
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:08,994
Why didn't you warn them, Burke?

650
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:10,662
What if that ship
didn't even exist?

651
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:12,247
Did you think about that?
I didn't know.

652
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:15,292
So if I made a major
security situation out of it...

653
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:16,960
everybody steps in...

654
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:18,962
and there's no
exclusive rights for anybody.

655
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:22,966
Nobody wins. I made a decision,
and it was wrong.

656
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:25,761
It was a bad call, Ripley.

657
00:44:25,803 --> 00:44:29,014
Bad call?
These people are dead, Burke!

658
00:44:29,056 --> 00:44:31,475
Haven't you any idea
what you've done?

659
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:34,311
I'm gonna make sure
they nail you right to the wall.

660
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:36,897
You're not gonna sleaze your way
out of this one.

661
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:38,524
Right to the wall.

662
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:41,735
Ripley.

663
00:44:42,778 --> 00:44:46,073
You know,
I expected more from you.

664
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:49,034
I thought
you'd be smarter than this.

665
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:52,287
I'm happy to disappoint you.

666
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,010
What's going on?

667
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,262
They're coming.

668
00:45:08,303 --> 00:45:11,014
-Where?
-In the tunnel.

669
00:45:12,516 --> 00:45:13,767
Here we go.

670
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:16,436
"A" and "B" gun
tracking and firing.

671
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:17,980
Multiple targets.

672
00:45:23,777 --> 00:45:25,696
Look at those ammo counters go.

673
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:30,409
"B" gun's down 50 percent.

674
00:45:31,618 --> 00:45:33,912
Man, it's a shooting gallery
down there.

675
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,585
Sixty rounds left on "B."

676
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:42,838
Forty...twenty...ten.

677
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,132
"B" gun's dry. Twenty on "A."

678
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:48,635
Ten...five...

679
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:53,932
That's it.

680
00:45:53,974 --> 00:45:57,311
Jesus.
They're wall-to-wall in there.

681
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,400
They're at the pressure door.

682
00:46:04,902 --> 00:46:06,987
Man, listen to that.

683
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:10,782
Bishop here.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

684
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:12,659
Well, that's a switch.

685
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,831
It's very pretty,
but what are we looking for?

686
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:21,376
That's it.
Emergency venting.

687
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:25,881
That's beautiful, man.
That beats it all.

688
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:28,383
How long till it blows?

689
00:46:28,425 --> 00:46:29,885
Four hours...

690
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:32,387
with a blast radius
of thirty kilometers...

691
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:35,599
equal to about forty megatons.

692
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:36,934
We got problems.

693
00:46:36,975 --> 00:46:39,478
I don't fucking
believe this!

694
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,730
Vasquez,
close the shutters.

695
00:46:41,772 --> 00:46:44,399
Why can't we
shut it down from here?

696
00:46:44,441 --> 00:46:46,443
The crash
caused too much damage.

697
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:48,946
An overload was inevitable
at this point.

698
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:52,032
Oh, man, I was getting short.

699
00:46:52,074 --> 00:46:53,951
Four more weeks and out.

700
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:55,869
Now I'm going to buy it
on this rock.

701
00:46:55,911 --> 00:46:57,538
Give us a break!

702
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:00,040
Four more weeks.
Oh, man.

703
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:03,001
We need the other
drop-ship from the Sulaco.

704
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:06,547
Can't we bring it down
on remote?

705
00:47:06,588 --> 00:47:10,175
The transmitter was on the APC.
It's wasted.

706
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:13,554
I don't care how.
We better think of a way.

707
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:16,431
Think of what?
We're fucked! We're doomed!

708
00:47:16,473 --> 00:47:19,309
Shut up! What about
the colony transmitters?

709
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:21,228
The uplink tower
at the other end?

710
00:47:21,228 --> 00:47:25,315
The hard-wiring between here
and there was damaged.

711
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:27,234
We can't align the dish.

712
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,695
Somebody's gonna
have to go out there...

713
00:47:29,736 --> 00:47:32,739
take a portable terminal
and patch in manually.

714
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:35,534
Yeah, sure. With those things
running around?

715
00:47:35,576 --> 00:47:37,911
You can count me out.

716
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:39,705
We can count you
out of everything.

717
00:47:39,746 --> 00:47:40,914
I'll go.

718
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:42,499
You go, man.

719
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:43,834
What?

720
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:45,085
I'll go.

721
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:48,255
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship.

722
00:47:48,297 --> 00:47:51,467
Yeah, right, man.
Bishop should go.

723
00:47:51,508 --> 00:47:52,759
Good idea.

724
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:54,970
Believe me,
I'd prefer not to.

725
00:47:55,012 --> 00:47:59,057
I may be synthetic,
but I'm not stupid.

726
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,653
How long?

727
00:48:11,695 --> 00:48:13,780
This conduit runs
almost to the uplink assembly-

728
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:15,240
one hundred eighty meters.

729
00:48:15,282 --> 00:48:18,452
Say forty minutes
crawling there...

730
00:48:18,452 --> 00:48:21,830
an hour to patch in
and align the antenna...

731
00:48:23,457 --> 00:48:25,125
thirty minutes
to prep the ship...

732
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:27,628
and about fifty minutes
flight time.

733
00:48:27,669 --> 00:48:30,172
It's gonna be close.

734
00:48:32,674 --> 00:48:34,760
Good luck.

735
00:48:34,802 --> 00:48:36,136
See you soon.

736
00:48:37,554 --> 00:48:39,389
Watch your fingers.

737
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:41,058
Oh.

738
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,729
Vaya con Dios, man.

739
00:48:57,658 --> 00:48:59,618
This is unbelievable.

740
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,955
Twenty meters and closing.
Fifteen.

741
00:49:02,996 --> 00:49:04,373
How many?

742
00:49:04,414 --> 00:49:07,084
Can't tell. Lots.

743
00:49:08,669 --> 00:49:10,546
"D" gun's down 50 percent.

744
00:49:13,882 --> 00:49:15,509
"C" gun's right behind it.

745
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:20,013
It ain't stopping 'em.

746
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:22,182
Jesus, it ain't stopping 'em.

747
00:49:22,224 --> 00:49:24,560
A hundred and fifty
rounds on "D."

748
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:26,645
Come on, baby. Come on.

749
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:28,147
One hundred rounds.

750
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:32,401
Come on, come on.

751
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:38,907
"D" gun's down to twenty.

752
00:49:40,117 --> 00:49:41,493
Ten.

753
00:49:43,787 --> 00:49:45,289
Damn it!

754
00:49:46,832 --> 00:49:49,835
Wait! They're retreating.

755
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:56,300
The guns stopped them.

756
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,680
You're right.

757
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:10,981
Next time
they walk right up and knock.

758
00:50:11,023 --> 00:50:13,358
Yeah, but they don't know that.

759
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,361
They're probably looking
for other ways to get in.

760
00:50:17,404 --> 00:50:18,822
That'll take 'em a while.

761
00:50:18,864 --> 00:50:21,366
-Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
-Shut up.

762
00:50:22,618 --> 00:50:25,204
I want you two
walking perimeter.

763
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:27,873
Move!

764
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:36,590
Hey, listen.

765
00:50:37,841 --> 00:50:40,177
We're all in strung-out shape...

766
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:44,223
but stay frosty and alert.

767
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:48,477
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

768
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,939
All right. Vámonos.

769
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:03,575
How long's it been
since you got any sleep?

770
00:51:03,617 --> 00:51:05,536
Twenty-four hours?

771
00:51:07,496 --> 00:51:10,707
Hicks, I'm not gonna end up
like those others.

772
00:51:10,749 --> 00:51:13,627
You'll take care of it,
won't you?

773
00:51:15,254 --> 00:51:19,716
If it comes to that,
I'll do us both.

774
00:51:21,468 --> 00:51:25,931
Let's just make sure it doesn't
come to that, all right?

775
00:51:25,973 --> 00:51:27,891
All right.

776
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:33,230
Hey, I want to introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

777
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:36,567
This is an M-41A pulse-rifle,
ten millimeter...

778
00:51:36,608 --> 00:51:41,071
with an over-and-under
30 millimeter grenade launcher.

779
00:51:41,113 --> 00:51:43,157
Feel the weight.

780
00:51:49,955 --> 00:51:52,416
OK, what do I do?

781
00:51:57,754 --> 00:52:00,215
Pull it in tight here.

782
00:52:00,257 --> 00:52:02,926
-Right.
-Lean into it.

783
00:52:02,968 --> 00:52:04,761
All right, it will kick some.

784
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:09,725
When the counter
reads zero here, you...

785
00:52:09,766 --> 00:52:11,351
-I press this up?
-That's right.

786
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:16,815
Get another one in quick.
Slap it in hard.

787
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:19,651
Now you're ready
to rock 'n' roll.

788
00:52:20,194 --> 00:52:23,113
-What's this?
-The grenade launcher.

789
00:52:23,155 --> 00:52:25,824
I don't think you want
to mess with that.

790
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:29,661
You started this.
Show me everything.

791
00:52:29,703 --> 00:52:31,663
I can handle myself.

792
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:35,417
Yeah, I noticed.

793
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:47,179
How do you feel?

794
00:52:47,221 --> 00:52:51,683
All right, I guess.
One hell of a hangover.

795
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:54,019
Look, Ripley, I just want-

796
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:57,022
Forget it. Excuse me.
