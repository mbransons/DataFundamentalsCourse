1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,371
Ohh.

3
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,210
You see what happened there?

4
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,715
I'm pretty sure you hit me.

5
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,808
No. I give you left, left.

6
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:01,285
You think I'll give another
left, and I gave you a right.

7
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,653
I'm just telling you...

8
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,660
that's what boxing's
all about, OK?

9
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,218
You show your opponent
one thing,

10
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,662
and you do
something else.

11
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,166
That's how Ali took
the title from Foreman.

12
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,828
He beat him with a rope-a-dope.
Don't you remember?

13
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:18,632
I don't remember what day
of the week it is.

14
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,073
That's right. Everyone thought
Ali's arms had run out,

15
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,977
that he's on empty, but he's
just setting Foreman up.

16
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,981
He's letting him
burn himself out.

17
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,551
And then in the eighth round,
he comes.

18
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,552
Poor George
has got nothing left.

19
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,828
I always liked
Bruce Lee movies.

20
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,169
Now you're learning.

21
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,009
Don't look at my hands.
Look at my shoulder.

22
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,978
That's where the punch
is coming from.

23
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,001
See?

24
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,815
You're still
looking at my hands.

25
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,252
Now come on,
let's try it again.

26
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,022
Come on, focus!
Come on! Shoulders, shoulders!

27
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,658
- Here.
- Nah. You keep it.

28
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,822
- Come on, you won.
- Yeah, but I always win.

29
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,059
I mean, I feel
so guilty about it.

30
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,862
Shut up and take it.

31
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,005
You know why you didn't
beat me today, Hale?

32
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,944
You've been boxing
for 20 years...

33
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,038
and you're better at it
than I am?

34
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,347
No. You don't have
the will to win.

35
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,447
Well, your insight
is shattering.

36
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,684
You had me today.

37
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,420
You could have shut me down,
but you blinked.

38
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,292
Yeah, well, we were
only sparring, buddy.

39
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,997
Thinking like that
is exactly why you lost.

40
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,970
- Now take this.
- It's yours.

41
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,199
No, no, no, take it.

42
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,367
If you didn't give it
everything you've got,

43
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,467
then I don't want it.
Go ahead.

44
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,706
You don't understand.
It really is yours.

45
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,408
I took it out of your wallet
while you were in the shower.

46
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,925
- General.
- General.

47
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:41,506
Major, were you recently
promoted past me?

48
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,507
No, sir.

49
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,169
Then why are you smoking
in my briefing room?

50
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,373
Sorry about that, sir.
That will never happen again.

51
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:52,706
Sit.

52
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,948
You take off in the Stealth
at 0-dark-30.

53
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,823
Fly a simulated,
low-level border penetration.

54
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,120
Nap of the earth
all the way.

55
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:07,120
- Scare cows, wake the farmers.
- Not tonight, buddy.

56
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:09,929
We're flying the B3
with two live nukes.

57
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,136
Palmdale's
concerned about...

58
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,797
low-level gamma
and x-ray diffusion...

59
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,306
screwing up the peripherals.

60
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,436
They want to send up a couple,
see if anything glows.

61
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:23,346
- 61s?
- Big ones. 83s.

62
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,112
Whoo! Crowd pleasers.

63
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:52,802
- How's your head?
- All right. I'll be fine.

64
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:54,505
I'm sorry about that.

65
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,309
Don't worry.
I'll get you back.

66
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,407
Ah, now you're dreaming.

67
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:00,317
After you, major.

68
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,443
These exercises are fantastic.

69
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,310
When we go to war
against Utah,

70
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,509
we are really going
to kick ass.

71
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,449
Ground control,
ready for rollout.

72
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,329
Park ranger.

73
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,306
I'd like to speak to you
about this campfire.

74
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,672
- Should I go?
- No, Wanda. You stay put.

75
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:35,609
Yeah, I know.
No wood fires in the park.

76
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,842
Wanda has a cold,
and I'm trying to keep her warm.

77
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,851
Sir, have you seen
any other hikers...

78
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:42,251
or campers
in this area?

79
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:46,053
Not this time of year.
What's the fine for this?

80
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,388
Pretty steep.

81
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,462
Secured.

82
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,984
Jesus Christ.
Drag him out of there.

83
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,821
Be smelling that all night.

84
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:36,197
Climb heading 287,
flight level 200.

85
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,835
That's 287, 200.

86
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,808
I don't think
that Aurora Project...

87
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,645
is going to happen for me.
Spoke to your buddy Taylor.

88
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,811
He doesn't feel like I have
enough fighter time to qualify.

89
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,343
And what did you
say to him?

90
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:51,480
Thank you very much,
sir. Good-bye.

91
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,491
You'll never change, will you?

92
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:56,585
And that, my friend,
will be your downfall.

93
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:59,995
- Know what your problem is?
- Yeah. I'm always right.

94
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:03,364
- You think you're always right.
- That's deep.

95
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:06,329
You should have made
colonel by now,

96
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:09,033
but you're too busy pushing
at everybody all the time.

97
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,806
That's an awesome
responsibility, isn't it?

98
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,045
McMurren control,
this is Go-Seven.

99
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,211
Colonel, you boys
in Utah still awake?

100
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,884
Copy, Major Deakins.
We're ready and waiting.

101
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,791
Be advised,
we're going to catch...

102
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,591
your sorry little butts
this morning and bite down hard.

103
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,530
You may pass that
along to Captain Hale...

104
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:35,192
with my compliments.

105
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,758
Wilkins is giving us attitude.

106
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,464
You want to take
a turn tonight?

107
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,703
I'll fly in one ear
and out the other.

108
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,208
He won't even know
we were there.

109
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:48,076
Hale says that
if anyone can catch us, you can.

110
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,042
And everyone get a fix.

111
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,243
They're about to
turn out the lights.

112
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:09,758
- Ready, captain?
- On your command, major.

113
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:11,098
Go to war.

114
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:13,527
Initiating stealth mode.

115
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,372
River valley approach.
Here we go.

116
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,344
Colonel, they've gone
to stealth mode.

117
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:31,344
We lost them on radar.
Anybody still holding?

118
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,357
Got capture on their
heat signature, sir.

119
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,188
- Good.
- They may be running cold,

120
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,195
but the air above
ten-five is colder.

121
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,026
Good man, Frenchy.
I like that.

122
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:41,191
Descend to 400 feet AGL,

123
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,531
altimeter setting 3001.

124
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:47,470
Air speed
.7 Mach 3001, 400 feet.

125
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:49,234
Nap of the earth.
Here we go.

126
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:10,157
Terry, you been
through the Needles entrance?

127
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:12,561
- No, why?
- Mrs. Parker just called.

128
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:16,294
Oh, God. What is it this time?
Another UFO?

129
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,199
Or did Elvis drop by for dinner?

130
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,168
She didn't mention him
but said a bunch of trucks...

131
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,174
went through the Needles
entrance an hour ago,

132
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,506
and she thought
they looked suspicious.

133
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:30,537
Clyde, what exactly does
a suspicious truck look like?

134
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,517
I don't know, and I have no idea.

135
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,041
Me neither.

136
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:39,011
The thing is, she said
one of the trucks was ours.

137
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:42,220
You're the only one out tonight,
so if it wasn't you...

138
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,856
She was probably
just hallucinating.

139
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,694
Don't worry.
I'll check it out.

140
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:00,071
- Lost them.
- Damn.

141
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,271
Come on, keep hunting.
Keep hunting.

142
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:07,348
We're below their eyes.
Proceed to primary target.

143
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:10,177
Descending to 200 feet.

144
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,815
Ridge coming up in 6 seconds.

145
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,518
I got it.

146
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,967
Whoo! Very nicely done.

147
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,972
- Excellent.
- Switching to autopilot.

148
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,997
Almost
as good as me.

149
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,067
I left a few trees behind.
I'll try to do better next time.

150
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:34,976
You really love
this shit, don't you?

151
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,674
Where else can you fly
a $2 billion plane...

152
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,184
800 miles an hour
100 feet off the ground?

153
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:42,846
That is a fact.
That is a fact.

154
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,717
You're in for life, huh?

155
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,121
As long as they'll have me.
Aren't you?

156
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,890
Nah, nah.
I don't think so.

157
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,925
I mean, come on.

158
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:59,025
You said it yourself,
I should be colonel by now.

159
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,800
Instead, idiots like Boone
become general.

160
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,808
Boone is not
such a bad guy.

161
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,810
If he had a thought
go through his head,

162
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,835
it would be the quickest trip
in North America.

163
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,847
Oh, nah.

164
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,281
Flying doesn't mean
what it used to mean to me.

165
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,652
Not the flying.
Carrying the nukes. I know you.

166
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,318
You love having the power of God
at your fingertips.

167
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,190
You get off on it.

168
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,511
Look out your window.
There's something wrong...

169
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,012
with the terrain
following here.

170
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,379
Shouldn't that starboard ridge
be on our port side?

171
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,124
Aah!

172
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,179
Here she comes.

173
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:25,912
No!

174
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:30,827
What the hell are you doing?

175
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,286
Clyde, I'm looking
at half a valley,

176
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,388
and there's nothing going...

177
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:11,798
Holy shit!

178
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,840
I got them!

179
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:57,411
McMurren!

180
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,384
This is Deakins! Hale's lost it!
I'm punching out!

181
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:30,547
Oh, shit!

182
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,349
Get me search and rescue.
We got pilots down.

183
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,822
Plane crashed 18 minutes ago.

184
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:46,523
The White House chief of staff
is on his way up.

185
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:56,534
Good morning, gentlemen.
So, do I wake the President?

186
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,366
- Bill.
- Jack.

187
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,614
Well, what have we got?

188
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,480
We're going out with this.

189
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:08,979
Rick's team prepared it.

190
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:13,623
"The United States Air Force
regrets to announce...

191
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:17,116
"that early this morning
a C141 heavy-lift cargo plane...

192
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,958
"went down
over the Utah desert.

193
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:21,624
"The status of the crew
has yet to be determined...

194
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,327
Yadda yadda yadda. "

195
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,597
That's very nice bullshit, Rick.

196
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:27,501
- Thank you, sir.
- We'll go with that.

197
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:29,339
Wait.

198
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,400
We're making a mistake.

199
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:37,981
Giles...

200
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:40,882
You have some input
you wish to share with us?

201
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,508
Yes, sir.

202
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,154
"Aviation Week"
has been following...

203
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:52,492
the development
of the B3 for years.

204
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,829
They have guys camping out
in lawn chairs all night...

205
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,663
out by the Whiteman
perimeter fence,

206
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:00,603
watching just in case
one of these things take off.

207
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,266
They're going to know
that one took off last night,

208
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:06,936
and they're going to know...
that it didn't come back.

209
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:08,605
We put out a press release...

210
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:12,047
saying a C141 went down in Utah,
they'll put 2 and 2 together.

211
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,948
"Aviation Week"
is going to run a story.

212
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,953
Everyone's going to know
what really happened,

213
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:19,718
and we're all going
to look extremely stupid.

214
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,786
We're better off
just telling the truth.

215
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:27,127
The truth?
How'd you get this job?

216
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:40,004
- Rewrite it... like Giles said.
- Yes, sir.

217
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:44,978
I want you to go to Utah.
I'll have my C21 standing by.

218
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:49,350
That was good work in there.
"Guys in lawn chairs... "

219
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:53,688
I don't know, Giles.
Sometimes you scare me.

220
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,486
Hell, sir...
sometimes I scare myself.

221
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:04,861
Move! Move! Move!
Come on!

222
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,334
Wallace, over there!

223
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,039
Reed, check over there!

224
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,911
Kelly, check over there!

225
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:36,761
- See anything?
- Not a goddamn thing!

226
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:40,132
Colonel, this is Rhodes.

227
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,365
Go, Max.

228
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:44,533
Aircraft disintegrated.
Negative survivors on site.

229
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,803
Checking payload. Over.

230
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:48,508
You watch your needles
there, chief.

231
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:52,977
Over here!

232
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:57,316
Over here!

233
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,357
Take that end.

234
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:29,215
The nukes are gone.

235
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:40,187
Colonel!

236
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:43,894
We got ourselves
a Broken Arrow.

237
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:49,903
You find those nukes, chief.

238
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:51,874
If your Geigers
pick up more rads...

239
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,309
than you get off a toaster,
I want you out of there.

240
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:58,379
Broken what?

241
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:03,148
Broken Arrow. It's a class IV
strategic theater emergency.

242
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:06,213
It's what we call it
when we lose a nuclear weapon.

243
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:10,653
I don't know what's scarier,
losing nuclear weapons...

244
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:13,492
or that it happens so often,
there's a term for it.

245
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:16,830
They've found the wreckage
90 miles outside of McMurren.

246
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,698
No bombs on board.

247
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,364
This is a real nightmare.

248
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:24,967
We don't know where
the damn things are.

249
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,170
Cappy, put 2 more teams
in the air.

250
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:30,044
I want Chief Rhodes backed up
to the fullest extent.

251
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:38,014
Why didn't they go off?

252
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:40,023
They have to be armed
to detonate.

253
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:42,855
They're designed
to survive crashes intact.

254
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:45,020
They could lie in a 
pool of burning jet fuel...

255
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:47,530
for 5 hours... no problem.

256
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:48,896
So, what the hell happened?

257
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,867
In his last transmission,

258
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:53,495
Major Deakins said
that Captain Hale lost control.

259
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:56,870
It's possible one of them
may have hit weapons release...

260
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:58,431
during the confusion.

261
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:47,049
Deakins.

262
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:02,862
You won that round.

263
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:18,514
Sir! Please turn around!

264
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:52,887
- Who the hell are you?
- Park ranger.

265
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,220
Just put it down,
and I won't have to kill you.

266
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:03,159
This isn't a standoff.
I've got the gun.

267
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:06,830
I never keep it loaded.

268
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:19,376
Thought you said
it wasn't loaded.

269
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:23,315
I lied.
Now, who the hell are you?

270
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,618
I'm a captain
in the United States Air Force.

271
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:29,649
Captain, you're under arrest
until we get this sorted out.

272
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,786
Lady, you're missing
the bigger picture here.

273
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:33,023
Uh!

274
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:38,994
Hold still.
All right?

275
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:41,334
I have already had
a hell of a morning, lady.

276
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:43,169
I can't tell you
what's going on,

277
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,175
but I need your help, OK?

278
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,200
This is a good way
to convince me.

279
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,515
We both know the gun is loaded.

280
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:59,215
If I wanted to, I could blow
your head off, right?

281
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:02,652
Yeah.

282
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:07,157
But I'm not going to.

283
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,126
Come on.

284
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:26,583
I got a radio in my truck.

285
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,185
It's this way.

286
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:51,238
Got them!

287
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:15,924
We got one.

288
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:43,990
How you doing?

289
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:47,292
Hey. You guys need
any help?

290
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:49,231
It's an Air Force
training exercise, sir.

291
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,464
I'll have to
ask you to leave.

292
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:55,165
Hey, no problem.
We just, uh...

293
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,030
Oh, jeez.

294
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,834
Any sign of Deakins?

295
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:31,170
Maybe the son of a bitch
is dead.

296
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,676
What a terrible thing to say.

297
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:45,651
Get them.

298
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:48,658
You assured me
everything would go smoothly.

299
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,660
Everything is going smoothly,
I assure you.

300
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:53,857
Our merchandise is not
where it's supposed to be.

301
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:55,888
It's right down there,
Mr. Pritchett.

302
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,433
Everything's on schedule.

303
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:15,448
Sir, we got one intact.
Let's go find the other one.

304
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:17,753
Move! Let's go!

305
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,284
Care for a Coke
or something?

306
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:23,155
2 gunships left McMurren
and are headed this way.

307
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:25,455
- Wonderful!
- Don't worry about them.

308
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:28,122
I worry. What about
the other pilot?

309
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:30,495
- We saw him eject.
- Huh.

310
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,829
Captain Hale. I seriously doubt
that he's alive.

311
00:29:35,337 --> 00:29:38,135
I punched him out when we were
scraping the valley floor.

312
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:40,698
There's a report
that a park ranger called in.

313
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:43,142
- She saw a pilot come down.
- Really?

314
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:48,574
Find her.

315
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,281
I got it!

316
00:30:03,198 --> 00:30:04,893
Hello? McMmurren, come in.

317
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,127
Go, Max.

318
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:09,363
McMurren, come in. Over.

319
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:11,570
Max, are you there?

320
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:13,096
McMurren?

321
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:14,073
Max.

322
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,340
McMurren, come in.

323
00:30:41,303 --> 00:30:42,463
Move!

324
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:46,302
Going to open the access panels.

325
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:48,872
Going to drop in
a couple grenades.

326
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,242
It won't go nuclear,
but it will destroy the bomb...

327
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:56,340
And whoever's
trying to steal it.

328
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:59,076
I can't let you do that, chief.

329
00:31:01,022 --> 00:31:02,512
And why not?

330
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,663
All clear!

331
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:47,057
- Where is your truck?
- Just around the bend.

332
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:50,560
- How did you find me?
- Saw your chute.

333
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:55,202
Don't step on that!
There. On that black stuff.

334
00:31:55,243 --> 00:31:57,837
It's cryptogammic soil.
Very fragile.

335
00:31:57,879 --> 00:32:01,246
One footprint takes
centuries to repair.

336
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:04,150
Come on. Jump. Yeah.

337
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:06,176
Thought it was a mine
or something.

338
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:10,590
Endangered dirt.
That's a new one.

339
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:18,598
Colonel Wilkins,
this is Airman Kelly, sir!

340
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:21,295
- Go.
- Chief Rhodes is dead!

341
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:22,769
They're all dead!

342
00:32:22,804 --> 00:32:26,035
What the hell happened?
What the hell happened?!

343
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:33,712
It's the nuke!
It's open! It's wide open!

344
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:36,547
Kelly, come in!
What happened?

345
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,486
Oh, God! What am I going to do?

346
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:48,826
Whoo!

347
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:54,232
Recall search and rescue.
Get me Washington.

348
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:57,030
I want N.E.S.T.
On this right now.

349
00:32:57,072 --> 00:33:00,473
- You missed your calling, boy.
- Yeah, Deak. I even bought it.

350
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:02,476
Make sure you get Hale! Go!

351
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,307
I'd like to remind you...

352
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:07,315
there's two attack helicopters
headed this way.

353
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:10,648
Not anymore.
They've just been recalled.

354
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:12,152
I'll check the perimeter.

355
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:13,984
That's where they're headed.
They're going over.

356
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:15,512
Get to work.

357
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:23,160
You see, Mr. Pritchett...

358
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:25,860
they believe they've got
an exposed core...

359
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:28,692
And that changes
things remarkably...

360
00:33:29,537 --> 00:33:31,334
Because you can't send
people out...

361
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:34,001
to an active radiation area.
That wouldn't be right.

362
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:37,011
First, you have to
take a picture from a satellite.

363
00:33:37,045 --> 00:33:39,673
That takes an hour and a half
to change orbit.

364
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,443
Then they send in a N.E.S.T.

365
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,547
That's a Nuclear
Emergency Search Team.

366
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,188
Closest one is
about 2 hours from here.

367
00:33:48,223 --> 00:33:52,023
By the time they find us,
we'll be gone. So relax.

368
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:02,795
Can your radio
get a signal to McMurren?

369
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:04,464
I'll have Clyde
patch us through.

370
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:08,340
We can get your people in here.
Then I can go feed my dog.

371
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:14,178
Clyde, this is Terry.
Do you read me?

372
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:39,534
Hello? Clyde, this is Terry.
Do you read me?

373
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:22,513
Why the hell are they
shooting at us?

374
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,518
We don't have time
to discuss it right now.

375
00:35:24,552 --> 00:35:26,019
Come on.

376
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:28,480
Let's have some fun.

377
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,531
Aah!

378
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:48,138
- You OK?
- Yeah.

379
00:35:48,176 --> 00:35:49,200
Give me your gun.

380
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,244
Come on.

381
00:36:14,002 --> 00:36:15,333
Come on.

382
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:24,110
- You have any more bullets?
- Yeah.

383
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:29,840
We need to get out
of this canyon.

384
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:32,843
We can get out
up that way.

385
00:36:33,388 --> 00:36:36,482
Now, if I could get
that bastard to hold still.

386
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:38,924
- I have an idea.
- Wait. I didn't mean...

387
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,365
Oh, shit.

388
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:02,039
Don't shoot!

389
00:37:03,017 --> 00:37:04,314
Where is he?

390
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:05,944
I don't know.

391
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,634
No.

392
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:46,115
Go!

393
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,699
Holy shit!

394
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:02,643
Novacek must have hit
a canyon wall.

395
00:38:03,645 --> 00:38:05,909
- You think?
- Maybe.

396
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:07,141
Maybe?

397
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:10,815
You said you'd planned
this thing carefully.

398
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,478
How are we going to move
those things now?

399
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:15,952
Use the trucks.

400
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,153
The trucks!
Now, you listen.

401
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:22,796
I've spent a lot of money
underwriting this,

402
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,664
and frankly, you're beginning
to shake my confidence!

403
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:36,640
Well... yeah.
Well, I, uh...

404
00:38:36,678 --> 00:38:39,476
I do appreciate the money
that you and your associates...

405
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:42,642
have invested
in this operation, but, uh...

406
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:45,653
it is an operation.
It's a military operation,

407
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:47,552
and you don't know dick
about that.

408
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:49,886
I have been in the military
for 20 years.

409
00:38:49,924 --> 00:38:52,859
I planned and flew
over 100 missions in the Gulf.

410
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,659
I put these boys together
because they are motivated...

411
00:38:55,697 --> 00:38:57,631
and they are
highly trained, like me.

412
00:38:57,665 --> 00:39:00,429
This is what I do,
and this is battle,

413
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:03,767
and battle is a highly
fluid situation.

414
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:06,603
You plan on your contingencies,
and I have.

415
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:08,438
You keep your initiative,
and I will.

416
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,706
But what you don't do
is share command.

417
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:12,303
It's never a good idea.

418
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,811
It's still my money.

419
00:39:18,353 --> 00:39:19,684
And if we succeed,

420
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,655
you and your friends
will get a ton of it.

421
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:23,088
If we're successful?

422
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,455
Look, Mr. Pritchett,

423
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,620
I will deliver the weapons
to the destination,

424
00:39:27,662 --> 00:39:30,631
but I can't depend
and I can't guarantee...

425
00:39:30,665 --> 00:39:32,132
that those assholes
in Washington...

426
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,794
won't do something stupid
like not pay.

427
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:36,826
What if they don't?

428
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,499
Well, if they don't...

429
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,476
The Southwest will be
a quiet neighborhood

430
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,842
for about 10,000 years.

431
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:54,555
Wilkins.

432
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:57,786
Fax me their last transmission.
How much radiation is tracking?

433
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:01,491
- Fax that to Mr. Prentice.
- Yes, sir.

434
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:03,360
So far, we're not
picking up any.

435
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:05,195
That's kind
of strange, isn't it?

436
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,532
I mean, with an exposed core?

437
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:11,561
The breach may not be
as bad as we thought.

438
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:30,718
Colonel... what if this
wasn't an accident?

439
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:33,860
What are you saying, Giles?

440
00:40:33,895 --> 00:40:35,863
In his final transmission
before the crash,

441
00:40:35,897 --> 00:40:38,331
Major Deakins said
Captain Hale lost it.

442
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:40,527
We all assume that
to mean pilot error...

443
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:44,971
or equipment failure,
but what if he meant...

444
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:47,531
Hale intentionally
lost the plane?

445
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:49,839
But why would he do that?

446
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:52,402
Two nuclear weapons
would be worth a lot of money.

447
00:40:52,447 --> 00:40:56,213
To who, son? There are easier
ways to buy nuclear weapons.

448
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,218
Go to one of the old
Soviet republics,

449
00:40:58,252 --> 00:41:01,153
they'll fix you up with a couple
for the price of a BMW.

450
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:06,183
Sir... I meant, how much
would they be worth to us?

451
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:08,252
How much would we pay
to get them back?

452
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:09,695
Hold on.

453
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:16,166
These nukes have codes that
prevent people from using them.

454
00:41:16,204 --> 00:41:17,671
Of course.

455
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:19,673
And no one knows
these codes, right,

456
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:21,675
except for the President
and you guys?

457
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:24,337
Access to the codes
requires the highest security.

458
00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:27,211
Not even the pilots
have these codes, right?

459
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:29,509
Where is that N.E.S.T. Team now?

460
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:31,516
They just took off, sir.

461
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:33,884
The E.T.A. In Utah
is 96 minutes.

462
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:42,552
- Correct 10, left.
- 10-4.

463
00:41:54,075 --> 00:41:56,771
- It's OK.
- It's not OK!

464
00:41:56,811 --> 00:42:00,508
I want to know
what's going on right now!

465
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:13,020
We were carrying nuclear weapons
on our plane last night.

466
00:42:16,364 --> 00:42:18,798
My former commander
is trying to steal them.

467
00:42:21,536 --> 00:42:24,528
- Oh, my God.
- That's why I need your help.

468
00:42:25,706 --> 00:42:29,164
Without the helicopter,
he won't be able to move them.

469
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,873
Deak will have a backup plan.
He'll be prepared for that.

470
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:39,042
Trucks. He's got trucks.

471
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,018
Last night Clyde radioed me...

472
00:42:42,056 --> 00:42:45,219
that someone came through
the Needles gate with trucks.

473
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,052
He won't take them towards town.
What else is around here?

474
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,757
The river.

475
00:43:04,512 --> 00:43:06,002
Do you mind?

476
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:08,508
No, I don't mind at all.

477
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:12,175
Care for one?

478
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:35,901
- The one in front has the nukes.
- How do you know?

479
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:38,377
There's only a driver.
They're keeping the weight down.

480
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:41,879
- Give me your gun again.
- What are you going to do?

481
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:46,012
I'll think of something.

482
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:48,990
Wait. We know where they are.

483
00:43:49,123 --> 00:43:50,522
Let's get to a phone
and call for help.

484
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:52,526
If they make it to the river,
I'll lose them again.

485
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,221
You get to the phone, OK?

486
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:58,193
- Then I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

487
00:43:58,232 --> 00:43:59,859
You're going to need help.

488
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,300
I don't have time
to argue with you, OK?

489
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:04,463
The nuclear weapons are
my responsibility, not yours.

490
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:06,803
You're a park ranger.
I'm a military officer.

491
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:08,206
Just go to the phone.

492
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:26,849
This is a bad idea.

493
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:36,695
Hi.

494
00:44:37,304 --> 00:44:38,293
Hi.

495
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,169
Hale! Well, goddamn!

496
00:45:00,795 --> 00:45:01,784
Run him down.

497
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,854
Get him!

498
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:09,794
Get him!

499
00:45:20,181 --> 00:45:21,170
Fuck!

500
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:27,279
Don't panic.
Bulletproof glass.

501
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,952
You can get out now.

502
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:34,454
Looks like we got ourselves
a standoff.

503
00:45:35,896 --> 00:45:38,626
- Aah!
- No... we... don't!

504
00:45:45,506 --> 00:45:46,871
Go! Go!

505
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:53,946
OK... you can come.

506
00:46:00,888 --> 00:46:01,877
Stay down!

507
00:46:04,325 --> 00:46:08,762
Would you mind not shooting
at the thermonuclear weapons?

508
00:46:18,172 --> 00:46:20,333
Where's St. Jude's
hospital from here?

509
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:22,703
Salt Lake City, I think.

510
00:46:32,686 --> 00:46:34,779
- Shit!
- What?

511
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:36,187
We're losing gas.

512
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,317
They must have hit the tank.

513
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:40,691
We need someplace
to hide these things.

514
00:46:41,428 --> 00:46:42,861
I know a place.

515
00:46:49,503 --> 00:46:50,697
Uh!

516
00:47:01,315 --> 00:47:03,306
What the fuck
are you up to, Hale?

517
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,520
Don't even.

518
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:21,390
Stop!

519
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:28,841
Aw, fuck!

520
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:37,514
You learn that
in survival school?

521
00:47:38,185 --> 00:47:42,019
New Jersey.
Trenton, New Jersey.

522
00:48:14,154 --> 00:48:15,644
What is this place?

523
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:18,458
It used to be a copper mine.

524
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:20,653
They shut it down
a couple years ago.

525
00:48:23,097 --> 00:48:25,156
Why would they have a new lock?

526
00:48:31,505 --> 00:48:32,995
All right.

527
00:48:35,843 --> 00:48:38,835
Good move, Hale.
I didn't see it coming...

528
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:43,673
But you're going to pay for it.
Saddle up, boys.

529
00:49:19,153 --> 00:49:22,645
This place has been prepped.
Deak's been here.

530
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:26,789
What? You think
he's coming back?

531
00:49:26,827 --> 00:49:30,160
That would be my guess.
May not have a lot of time.

532
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:32,757
What are we going to do?

533
00:49:39,673 --> 00:49:42,164
We'll just take away
his reason for being here.

534
00:49:43,177 --> 00:49:45,168
Want to help me
unload these things?

535
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:54,146
Where do you think
they're going?

536
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:56,850
Same place we were...
the only thing on this road.

537
00:50:08,469 --> 00:50:09,834
My God.

538
00:50:16,543 --> 00:50:18,374
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

539
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:20,673
When you fly
with nuclear weapons,

540
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:22,682
you're trained
to retrieve if possible,

541
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:26,083
disable if necessary,
and destroy if essential.

542
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,678
And what are we doing?

543
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:31,922
I'm going to disable it.

544
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,858
You have to arm
these things with a code.

545
00:50:35,896 --> 00:50:39,059
If you enter the wrong code
3 times, the nuke goes dead.

546
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:41,727
All the circuitry
shuts down and shorts out.

547
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,938
Pretty soon
these things will be...

548
00:50:44,972 --> 00:50:46,906
nothing more
than paperweights.

549
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:55,648
Hale, pick up.

550
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:57,975
Pick up!

551
00:50:58,753 --> 00:51:01,984
Come on, buddy.
Pick up the phone.

552
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:04,617
Buddy, huh?
Son of a bitch.

553
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:07,594
You tried to kill me.
The friendship is over.

554
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:09,654
That doesn't mean
I don't like you.

555
00:51:09,698 --> 00:51:11,325
Hell, I'm impressed.

556
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:14,699
I figured you'd have packed up
and walked off by now.

557
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:17,398
You figured wrong.
Now I got the nukes.

558
00:51:17,439 --> 00:51:20,237
Guess what, Deak.
I'm going to deactivate them.

559
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,868
You hear that?

560
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:24,435
That's me punching
the wrong codes.

561
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:27,141
Pretty soon these things
will be absolutely useless.

562
00:51:27,182 --> 00:51:29,150
Might as well turn around
and drive away.

563
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:32,244
Outstanding, Hale.
That's the spirit.

564
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:34,414
Damn. I'm totally screwed now.

565
00:51:35,924 --> 00:51:38,392
Unless I thought of that
ahead of time.

566
00:51:43,765 --> 00:51:45,027
What?

567
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:47,598
You're kidding.

568
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:53,641
Didn't work, did it?
I used uncoded circuit boards.

569
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:57,941
You just activated
a nuclear warhead, my friend.

570
00:51:57,979 --> 00:52:01,142
Setting off a nuke in this mine
has been my plan from day one.

571
00:52:01,182 --> 00:52:02,706
Otherwise, some D.C. Civilian...

572
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:05,185
might say
I haven't got the guts.

573
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:08,954
Fuck!

574
00:52:11,192 --> 00:52:13,126
He's insane.

575
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:17,120
I considered bringing you in.
You know why I didn't?

576
00:52:17,165 --> 00:52:20,931
- Because I would have said no?
- Nah. I'd have just killed you.

577
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:23,767
I was afraid you'd say yes...

578
00:52:23,805 --> 00:52:26,467
because you don't have the balls
to go through with this.

579
00:52:26,508 --> 00:52:27,941
We both know that.

580
00:52:31,246 --> 00:52:33,271
How deep is this mine?

581
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:36,045
Uh... about 2,000 feet.

582
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:39,347
That's plenty.

583
00:52:39,387 --> 00:52:41,787
I'm going to be there
in a few minutes.

584
00:52:41,823 --> 00:52:43,791
Get out of there
as soon as you can.

585
00:52:43,825 --> 00:52:45,816
It's your last move, buddy.

586
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,260
I can think of another move.

587
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:51,129
I'll keep these together.
If one goes off,

588
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:54,101
the other gets buried
under a billion tons of rock.

589
00:52:54,135 --> 00:52:56,660
How does that sound?

590
00:52:56,705 --> 00:52:58,900
You wouldn't
do something like that.

591
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,636
You sure about that... buddy?

592
00:53:02,577 --> 00:53:05,011
Shit! Fuck!
He's going to do it.

593
00:53:05,046 --> 00:53:06,104
Let's get him.

594
00:53:06,147 --> 00:53:08,843
We've got to be gone
before he gets here.

595
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:19,219
I can't do this.

596
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,229
Listen, you told me
this is a copper mine, right?

597
00:53:22,263 --> 00:53:23,890
- Right?
- Right.

598
00:53:23,932 --> 00:53:28,198
The blast will fuse this place
into one big solid copper pot.

599
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:30,670
- But they're coming!
- That's right.

600
00:53:30,705 --> 00:53:33,833
If I don't get these to a safe
level before they get here,

601
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,843
God knows where he'll use them.

602
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:49,279
Just keep an eye
on the timer, OK?

603
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:06,203
All right.

604
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,912
What is that noise?

605
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:59,448
Water. There's an underground
river beneath this place.

606
00:54:59,494 --> 00:55:01,485
Let's get these things unloaded.

607
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:31,788
I understand, sir.

608
00:55:31,826 --> 00:55:33,987
I'll advise N.E.S.T.
Of the situation.

609
00:55:34,028 --> 00:55:37,225
As soon as the ground is clean,
I'll send in a dozen gunships.

610
00:55:37,265 --> 00:55:39,233
We'll secure the whole area.

611
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:40,757
Yes, sir.

612
00:55:44,138 --> 00:55:46,470
- Giles Prentice, sir.
- Wilkins.

613
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:49,033
- Good to meet you finally.
- Likewise, sir.

614
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:51,568
That was the chairman,
Mr. Prentice.

615
00:55:51,613 --> 00:55:54,980
According to an N.S.A.
Radio intercept, you were right,

616
00:55:55,016 --> 00:55:58,577
but it's Deakins
stealing the nukes, not Hale.

617
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:18,465
Now what?

618
00:56:18,506 --> 00:56:20,701
We get out of here
before he shows up.

619
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:41,494
How many times
do I have to say it?

620
00:56:41,529 --> 00:56:44,293
Please don't shoot
the nuclear weapons.

621
00:57:28,242 --> 00:57:30,710
Kelly, we found the nuke.

622
00:57:30,745 --> 00:57:32,872
We're at the end of tunnel "A."

623
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:35,405
Put the cold one on the
elevator, and we'll be along.

624
00:57:43,558 --> 00:57:45,287
A service tunnel.
Come on.

625
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:50,229
Make sure Hale
doesn't get back to the bomb.

626
00:57:50,264 --> 00:57:53,256
And, Johnson,
the clock is ticking.

627
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:22,830
- Where are you taking us?
- Back to the elevator.

628
00:58:22,864 --> 00:58:25,765
These service tunnels
run between the main shafts.

629
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,428
Now... if we take
the next right...

630
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:30,564
Aah!

631
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:46,252
Hey, Hale.
Nice move with the nukes.

632
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:49,984
Shows initiative, determination.
Proud of you!

633
00:58:51,426 --> 00:58:53,417
But I think I gave us
too much time.

634
00:58:53,461 --> 00:58:55,895
30 whole minutes...
I don't know.

635
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,694
Shows a lack of total
commitment, don't you think?

636
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,598
So I took it down to 13.

637
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:06,338
I'll be right back.

638
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:04,120
Bitch!

639
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:27,810
- All set.
- We'll be right along.

640
01:01:24,345 --> 01:01:26,040
Are you OK?

641
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,390
Well, I got to go.

642
01:01:45,433 --> 01:01:47,799
You two have a nice time
down here.

643
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,071
And don't forget to say hi
to Johnson for me...

644
01:01:53,107 --> 01:01:54,938
when you see him.

645
01:01:54,976 --> 01:01:57,467
20 bucks says
you're going to see him first.

646
01:01:58,713 --> 01:02:00,840
- Really?
- Yeah.

647
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:03,908
You're going to ransom
Salt Lake City, aren't you?

648
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:05,680
Why do you say that?

649
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,210
St. Jude's hospital.

650
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:09,655
You'll hide the warheads
in radiology...

651
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:12,386
so they don't show up
on satellite scans, right?

652
01:02:12,426 --> 01:02:14,394
Huh. Well, I'm impressed.

653
01:02:15,096 --> 01:02:18,588
Thank you.
So, how much you ask for?

654
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:21,101
Lots. I got a broker
in Stockholm...

655
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:23,831
that's going to buy me
5% of Volvo.

656
01:02:23,871 --> 01:02:26,840
For the rest of my years,
I'll live off the dividends,

657
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:29,900
happy in the knowledge
that I'm helping to make...

658
01:02:29,944 --> 01:02:33,436
the safest automobiles
in the world.

659
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:36,575
So that's what this
is all about? Money?

660
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:39,211
- Yeah.
- Bullshit.

661
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:41,380
You tell me why.
Go ahead.

662
01:02:43,124 --> 01:02:44,785
You tell me why.

663
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:47,487
Because you've been passed over
for promotion so many times,

664
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:49,758
you want to show the bastards
you're right.

665
01:02:49,797 --> 01:02:52,732
Maybe it's because
everybody's cashing out,

666
01:02:52,767 --> 01:02:54,359
so why the hell not you?

667
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:58,031
Maybe your mother dropped you on
your head when you were a baby.

668
01:02:58,072 --> 01:02:59,505
Who the hell cares?

669
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,201
There's no difference
between you...

670
01:03:01,242 --> 01:03:03,301
and a guy who
shoots up a schoolyard.

671
01:03:03,344 --> 01:03:06,575
You both got a head
full of bad wiring.

672
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:09,242
- What was that?
- You're fucked in the head!

673
01:03:11,585 --> 01:03:12,574
Ha!

674
01:03:13,821 --> 01:03:15,379
I pissed him off.

675
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:28,460
Uh, uh... it's this way.

676
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:42,816
Hey, hey, hey!
Where the hell's the other one?

677
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:43,976
Shut up.

678
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:53,257
Help us. Come on.

679
01:04:09,076 --> 01:04:10,941
Aah...

680
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:13,503
What a Mongolian clusterfuck.

681
01:04:13,547 --> 01:04:16,015
Get the goddamn thing in.
Let's get out of here.

682
01:04:18,886 --> 01:04:20,854
That was the only way out.

683
01:04:23,424 --> 01:04:24,755
Oh, man.

684
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,253
That's it, then, isn't it?

685
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:48,805
You have any family?

686
01:04:51,752 --> 01:04:54,016
No. Just me and Fred.

687
01:04:55,623 --> 01:04:59,252
Fred. Uh, who's Fred?
Your boyfriend?

688
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:00,692
No. My dog.

689
01:05:04,698 --> 01:05:05,995
The river.

690
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:08,365
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

691
01:05:08,402 --> 01:05:12,771
They hit it digging a tunnel.

692
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:14,900
That's why they shut down
the mine.

693
01:05:15,743 --> 01:05:17,176
Come on.

694
01:05:37,965 --> 01:05:40,092
Hang on.
Four minutes to detonation.

695
01:05:40,801 --> 01:05:43,668
You stupid bastard!
We'll all be killed!

696
01:05:43,704 --> 01:05:45,137
We'll be fine, Mr. Pritchett.

697
01:05:45,172 --> 01:05:48,767
Please keep your voice down.
I'm trying to concentrate.

698
01:05:53,446 --> 01:05:54,811
This should be it.

699
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,700
That seam doesn't go anywhere.

700
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:21,229
Oh...

701
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:32,842
One o'clock. On the road.

702
01:06:51,938 --> 01:06:54,236
Attention.
We are federal agents.

703
01:06:54,273 --> 01:06:56,741
Stop your vehicle immediately.

704
01:06:56,776 --> 01:06:59,404
Oh, God! Oh, God!

705
01:06:59,445 --> 01:07:03,006
How does that gunship
fit into your grand strategy?

706
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:05,108
You don't know
what you're doing!

707
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:08,177
This is out of control!
I must have been...

708
01:07:11,691 --> 01:07:13,784
Hush. Hush.

709
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:15,691
Stop your vehicle.

710
01:07:15,728 --> 01:07:18,253
I repeat,
stop your vehicle immediately.

711
01:07:29,008 --> 01:07:30,475
We'll get in front of him.

712
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,110
Do not move,
or you will be fired upon.

713
01:07:41,354 --> 01:07:43,015
Ah-ah!

714
01:07:43,056 --> 01:07:44,614
We are federal agents.

715
01:07:44,657 --> 01:07:48,218
Throw down your weapons
and keep your hands in sight.

716
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:13,275
I just realized something.

717
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:15,549
I never actually
killed anyone before.

718
01:08:15,588 --> 01:08:19,524
I mean... I dropped
bombs on Baghdad,

719
01:08:19,559 --> 01:08:22,119
but never face-to-face.

720
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:25,697
I don't know
what the big deal is.

721
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:26,891
I really don't.

722
01:08:30,603 --> 01:08:33,265
Turn your electronic equipment
off now.

723
01:08:33,306 --> 01:08:34,705
Throw down your weapons.

724
01:09:18,484 --> 01:09:21,510
- We're losing power!
- Oh, my God!

725
01:09:28,027 --> 01:09:30,086
Control, people. Control.

726
01:09:31,297 --> 01:09:33,197
We've gone red!
Trip the relays!

727
01:09:37,136 --> 01:09:38,797
Aah...

728
01:09:48,514 --> 01:09:50,414
I said, goddamn,
what a rush!

729
01:09:54,253 --> 01:09:55,277
Whoo!

730
01:09:55,321 --> 01:09:56,913
Son of a bitch!

731
01:09:56,956 --> 01:09:59,049
Shock wave took down
the damn chopper.

732
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:01,491
That's E.M.P...
electromagnetic pulse.

733
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:03,495
Nuclear blast
sends it out for miles.

734
01:10:03,529 --> 01:10:05,292
Everything electronic
shuts down,

735
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:07,561
including choppers
and radios.

736
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,660
Hell, we just shut down
McMurren's field communications.

737
01:10:10,703 --> 01:10:13,501
That will put a dent
in their response time, huh?

738
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:16,702
- Deak, you the man!
- I'm the man!

739
01:10:16,742 --> 01:10:19,438
Shouldn't we be evacuating?

740
01:10:19,478 --> 01:10:21,241
We're fine. It was underground.

741
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,009
Colonel Wilkins
to General Creely.

742
01:10:23,049 --> 01:10:24,676
How do you know?

743
01:10:24,717 --> 01:10:26,708
If it had been
a surface detonation,

744
01:10:26,752 --> 01:10:28,947
we'd have felt a different kind
of ground tremor.

745
01:10:28,988 --> 01:10:31,115
We'd also be burned,
blind, and dying.

746
01:10:35,294 --> 01:10:36,488
We're 10 minutes behind.

747
01:10:36,529 --> 01:10:39,692
Mr. Pritchett, would you mind
stepping outside?

748
01:10:51,844 --> 01:10:53,641
It went off underground,
thank God.

749
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:54,976
What do we do now?

750
01:10:55,948 --> 01:10:59,475
First, we nail a huge
goddamn lid on this thing.

751
01:10:59,518 --> 01:11:01,748
And with all due respect
to your boy Giles...

752
01:11:01,787 --> 01:11:05,655
and his belief that honesty
is the best policy,

753
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:08,353
from now until
the end of the world,

754
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:12,228
what happened in Utah today
was an earthquake.

755
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,964
Hey, it's OK.

756
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:51,902
My God.
We set off a nuclear bomb.

757
01:11:51,937 --> 01:11:53,461
The walls shielded the blast.

758
01:11:53,506 --> 01:11:55,440
None of the radiation
leaked out.

759
01:11:55,474 --> 01:11:57,465
- We're all right.
- Look at my hands.

760
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:00,638
- Why are they shaking like that?
- Because the water was freezing.

761
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,478
- That's not normal.
- No, it's OK.

762
01:12:03,516 --> 01:12:07,008
We're just cold.
Just need to get warm.

763
01:12:07,053 --> 01:12:08,953
OK? All right?

764
01:12:13,225 --> 01:12:16,126
Hey, look.
See the butterflies there?

765
01:12:16,162 --> 01:12:18,426
If there was radiation,
they wouldn't survive.

766
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:21,160
Now, would they? No.

767
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:26,235
All right?

768
01:12:26,272 --> 01:12:27,933
I guess not.

769
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:34,446
It says so
in the detonation manual,

770
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,540
that if you see butterflies
after detonation,

771
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:40,381
you're going to be fine. OK?

772
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:45,347
It doesn't say that.

773
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:48,559
I promise you, though,
we're fine.

774
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:57,195
How far downriver
does this path go?

775
01:12:57,236 --> 01:12:59,033
Three or four miles.

776
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:02,063
We should get to Deakins
before he gets out of here.

777
01:13:17,456 --> 01:13:18,445
Wait.

778
01:13:24,697 --> 01:13:26,688
Looks like there's
just two of them.

779
01:13:29,635 --> 01:13:30,932
There's more coming.

780
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:43,875
I thought you said Hale
wouldn't be a problem.

781
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:47,010
He surprised me, too,
but he's dead, so let's go.

782
01:14:39,839 --> 01:14:42,205
- Sink it?
- Steal it.

783
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:57,889
- Let's move it.
- They're coming.

784
01:14:57,923 --> 01:15:00,824
Get out of the boat.
Get out of the boat!

785
01:15:31,824 --> 01:15:33,792
Well, your friends
in Washington...

786
01:15:33,826 --> 01:15:36,124
should be getting
the package now.

787
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:40,825
Yep. I'm sure we got their full
and complete attention.

788
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:43,596
Let's move it.
We're on a tight schedule.

789
01:16:19,404 --> 01:16:22,635
...$250 million by 1400,
Utah time.

790
01:16:22,674 --> 01:16:26,235
This deadline is not negotiable,
and there is no grace period.

791
01:16:26,278 --> 01:16:28,041
The second device is on a timer.

792
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,571
Shortly after you receive this,
the timer will be activated.

793
01:16:30,616 --> 01:16:32,982
At 1401, I will make a call.

794
01:16:33,018 --> 01:16:35,452
If you have complied,
I will stop the timer.

795
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:37,352
If you have not...

796
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:07,919
Yes. Yes, sir. I understand.

797
01:17:10,322 --> 01:17:12,381
- Creely.
- Please hold.

798
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,356
The President is asking if we
know where the device is headed.

799
01:17:17,396 --> 01:17:20,092
If Deakins had a plane waiting,
it could be anywhere.

800
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:22,259
- We just don't know.
- I do.

801
01:17:23,402 --> 01:17:24,630
One moment, sir.

802
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:27,036
This is Colonel Jamison.
They've found Captain Hale.

803
01:17:27,072 --> 01:17:28,903
He's at Lake Powell.

804
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:49,727
This is a really bad idea.

805
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:28,966
- Sir, the prisoner is secure.
- All right, Tom. Good job.

806
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:31,060
You gentlemen can R.T.B.
I'll take it.

807
01:18:31,103 --> 01:18:32,900
Roger, sir. Returning to base.

808
01:18:33,905 --> 01:18:36,430
They found the raft
on the other side of the lake.

809
01:18:36,475 --> 01:18:40,070
Tracks from a heavy truck
ran out on the paved road.

810
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,914
- What about the girl?
- What about her?

811
01:18:44,716 --> 01:18:47,207
What about her?
She's an innocent victim.

812
01:18:47,252 --> 01:18:48,685
I got her involved.

813
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,484
You're going to hit that truck
with everything you've got.

814
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,650
I don't want her
becoming a casualty.

815
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:55,455
Maybe giving her up
is OK with you,

816
01:18:55,494 --> 01:18:57,052
but we're military officers.

817
01:18:57,095 --> 01:19:00,531
We took an oath,
one officer to another.

818
01:19:00,565 --> 01:19:02,760
We have a responsibility
to save that woman's life...

819
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:04,291
and get back the weapon.

820
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:07,470
I have a responsibility
to follow orders...

821
01:19:07,506 --> 01:19:08,768
and return you to McMurren.

822
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:11,275
Do you understand
what orders are, captain?

823
01:19:11,309 --> 01:19:14,403
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Good.

824
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:22,314
Because I'm about to break them.

825
01:19:26,491 --> 01:19:29,756
- Any argument, Mr. Prentice?
- No, sir.

826
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:34,588
Just for the record,
I'm not entirely a civilian.

827
01:19:34,633 --> 01:19:39,093
I was actually a lieutenant
in the R.O.T.C. At Yale.

828
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:44,165
Good for you, lieutenant.

829
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,874
- Is the radio still down?
- Afraid so.

830
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,282
Your chopper will be
refueled in two minutes.

831
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:56,050
I wish I were going with you.

832
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:58,852
Captain, what exactly
are you looking for?

833
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:01,654
- Tracks.
- As in railroad tracks?

834
01:20:01,693 --> 01:20:04,184
Yeah. Deak knows you're covering
every inch of asphalt.

835
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:06,754
I'll bet 20 bucks
that nuke isn't on a truck.

836
01:20:06,798 --> 01:20:10,325
- It's on a train.
- Let me see the map.

837
01:20:10,368 --> 01:20:12,097
Salt Lake is northwest of here.

838
01:20:12,137 --> 01:20:13,832
These tracks curve east
before Salt Lake.

839
01:20:13,872 --> 01:20:15,237
Why would he do that?

840
01:20:15,273 --> 01:20:17,104
I don't think he's going
to Salt Lake.

841
01:20:19,478 --> 01:20:21,173
But that's where
the closest hospital is.

842
01:20:21,213 --> 01:20:22,942
You found the radiology tag.

843
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:25,211
That's what's bothering me.
I think he planted it...

844
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:28,378
to make the person that found it
think that's where he's heading.

845
01:20:29,754 --> 01:20:32,279
- He's doing a rope-a-dope.
- He's doing a what?

846
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:37,120
Rope-a-dope. It's a boxing term.
Ali and Foreman in Zaire.

847
01:20:37,162 --> 01:20:39,289
I know what the rope-a-dope is.
What's your point?

848
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:42,823
My point is that everything he
shows us says he's heading west.

849
01:20:42,868 --> 01:20:44,460
He's actually heading east.

850
01:20:46,338 --> 01:20:47,396
Denver.

851
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:52,700
You said you had Salt Lake
sealed up pretty tight.

852
01:20:52,744 --> 01:20:55,304
What's it going to hurt
if we check out Denver?

853
01:21:14,266 --> 01:21:17,394
Shepherd!
Any trouble with the train crew?

854
01:21:17,435 --> 01:21:19,403
Not a bit.
They went like lambs.

855
01:21:19,437 --> 01:21:22,565
Good for them. Let's get
that satellite dish wired in.

856
01:21:22,607 --> 01:21:24,666
- Already done.
- Excellent.

857
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:27,837
With this remote, you can shut
the bomb down face-to-face...

858
01:21:27,879 --> 01:21:30,211
or dial it in over the link.

859
01:21:30,248 --> 01:21:32,079
All right.
Let's close this deal.

860
01:21:32,117 --> 01:21:34,085
I want to be airborne
in five minutes...

861
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:35,814
en route to the mountains.

862
01:21:35,854 --> 01:21:38,550
Contact Washington. Tell them
the bomb's on its way to Denver.

863
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,921
Then contact Geneva.

864
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:42,620
When the money's in place,
I'll shut down that puppy.

865
01:21:43,762 --> 01:21:45,923
Smile, boys.
We're about to retire.

866
01:21:45,964 --> 01:21:48,057
Let's get this bird unwrapped.

867
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:21,222
Uhh!

868
01:22:23,168 --> 01:22:25,102
We haven't met.
I'm Max.

869
01:22:30,942 --> 01:22:32,273
Uhh!

870
01:22:34,846 --> 01:22:37,474
You probably thought
I was a computer nerd.

871
01:22:37,515 --> 01:22:39,847
Ha ha ha! Wrong.

872
01:22:39,884 --> 01:22:41,715
I was a Navy S.E.A.L., lady.

873
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:45,245
You should see what I can do
with just my thumb.

874
01:23:39,844 --> 01:23:43,302
You just saved me $3 million.
I owe you one.

875
01:23:43,348 --> 01:23:45,145
Shoot yourself.
We'll call it square.

876
01:23:45,183 --> 01:23:46,946
Whoa. Attitude.

877
01:23:50,455 --> 01:23:52,980
Now, where's
my little buddy Hale?

878
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:55,224
He left you alone, didn't he?

879
01:23:55,794 --> 01:23:59,059
Oh, that's his speed...
100% pussy.

880
01:23:59,931 --> 01:24:01,990
He's got more guts
than you think.

881
01:24:05,236 --> 01:24:07,704
But would he have enough guts
to eat a bullet...

882
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:10,367
before he'd help someone
vaporize a whole city?

883
01:24:10,408 --> 01:24:13,775
I think he'd fold, but not you.

884
01:24:13,812 --> 01:24:16,178
I think you've got
more guts than he does.

885
01:24:16,214 --> 01:24:18,910
I think you'd eat a bullet.

886
01:24:24,356 --> 01:24:25,618
Let's find out.

887
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:30,092
Now, press four.

888
01:24:31,062 --> 01:24:32,154
Ooh.

889
01:24:37,268 --> 01:24:39,498
Ahh, I said push four.

890
01:24:43,274 --> 01:24:44,741
Go ahead.

891
01:24:44,776 --> 01:24:46,209
Push four.

892
01:24:52,384 --> 01:24:53,817
Ahh.

893
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,144
Four.

894
01:24:58,423 --> 01:24:59,583
Eight.

895
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:03,986
Seven.

896
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:07,098
Go ahead.

897
01:25:07,132 --> 01:25:08,099
Please.

898
01:25:08,133 --> 01:25:09,395
Seven.

899
01:25:14,038 --> 01:25:15,596
Starting at ground zero...

900
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,437
and moving out
in concentric circles,

901
01:25:17,475 --> 01:25:19,534
we have, in terms
of immediate effect,

902
01:25:19,577 --> 01:25:23,638
100% fatalities to 30 miles,
90% at 40 miles,

903
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:26,980
dropping roughly 10%
for every 10 miles after that.

904
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:28,743
Two.

905
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:32,515
One.

906
01:25:35,894 --> 01:25:37,156
Enter.

907
01:25:39,297 --> 01:25:40,889
Enter.

908
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:47,867
We estimate...
250,000 dead on impact...

909
01:25:47,906 --> 01:25:50,602
and another quarter-million
projected within the year.

910
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:56,669
Enter.

911
01:25:57,916 --> 01:26:00,612
Come on. Just push "enter,"
and it's done.

912
01:26:03,922 --> 01:26:05,981
Which is it going to be, hmm?

913
01:26:09,494 --> 01:26:11,359
Ahh. Hmm.

914
01:26:12,864 --> 01:26:16,265
To tell the truth, I thought
you were going to fold.

915
01:26:17,402 --> 01:26:19,233
Well, I'm dead either way.

916
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:22,466
So do it yourself, asshole.

917
01:26:25,443 --> 01:26:26,774
Open the door!

918
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:33,380
Night-night, honey.

919
01:27:18,196 --> 01:27:21,097
- Cover me.
- Good luck.

920
01:27:24,769 --> 01:27:26,566
Uhh! Uhh!

921
01:27:27,438 --> 01:27:28,632
Bring it in.

922
01:27:52,597 --> 01:27:54,121
Give me your hand.

923
01:28:06,978 --> 01:28:08,946
OK... you can come.

924
01:28:15,053 --> 01:28:16,680
Get me down there!

925
01:28:30,034 --> 01:28:31,558
Let's give those guys a haircut.

926
01:28:38,109 --> 01:28:39,337
Shit!

927
01:28:39,377 --> 01:28:40,503
Get down!

928
01:28:52,223 --> 01:28:53,281
Freeze!

929
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:25,217
- Wow.
- That was a first for me, too.

930
01:30:03,895 --> 01:30:06,022
Uhh!

931
01:30:14,038 --> 01:30:15,528
Uhh!

932
01:30:35,393 --> 01:30:37,418
This is where you two get off.

933
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,129
No!

934
01:31:32,883 --> 01:31:35,010
- We're leaving, now!
- Yes, sir!

935
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,415
- Where's Shepherd?
- He's supposed to be here.

936
01:31:38,456 --> 01:31:39,514
Find him!

937
01:31:56,006 --> 01:31:57,337
Cut the power!

938
01:31:59,577 --> 01:32:01,010
Aaah!

939
01:32:01,445 --> 01:32:03,513
Aaah!

940
01:32:13,924 --> 01:32:15,448
Goddamn you, Hale.

941
01:32:21,265 --> 01:32:23,529
We're never going
to get clear in time.

942
01:32:23,567 --> 01:32:26,092
We need to shut down the nuke.
You hear me?

943
01:32:26,136 --> 01:32:29,071
- You need to disarm it.
- Find Hale.

944
01:32:54,665 --> 01:32:56,394
Oh, God. Your shoulder.

945
01:32:57,501 --> 01:33:00,629
- Help me off with this.
- Oh, God.

946
01:33:19,023 --> 01:33:22,390
No matter what, this train
can't make it to the city.

947
01:33:23,761 --> 01:33:25,991
So you stay here
and uncouple the car.

948
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:27,657
I'm going to go after Deakins.

949
01:33:31,101 --> 01:33:33,433
- I'll see you soon.
- You promise?

950
01:33:51,956 --> 01:33:53,947
Fuck them if they
can't take a joke.

951
01:34:04,268 --> 01:34:05,826
What the fuck are you doing?

952
01:34:31,729 --> 01:34:33,924
Shut that son of a bitch
down, now!

953
01:34:33,964 --> 01:34:36,023
This ain't what I signed on for.

954
01:34:36,066 --> 01:34:38,694
I'm not ready to die,
not for you.

955
01:34:39,336 --> 01:34:42,999
Everybody dies, Kelly.
I'm as good a reason as any.

956
01:34:47,111 --> 01:34:49,443
Come on. Come on.

957
01:34:52,349 --> 01:34:53,338
Hale!

958
01:34:57,221 --> 01:34:58,654
Incoming!

959
01:35:00,557 --> 01:35:02,320
Uh!

960
01:35:03,994 --> 01:35:06,485
Yaaah!

961
01:35:27,317 --> 01:35:29,251
Come on out, Deak.
It's over.

962
01:35:45,169 --> 01:35:46,659
Ha ha ha!

963
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:52,633
You lose.

964
01:35:52,676 --> 01:35:54,701
I still got my finger
on the trigger.

965
01:35:55,612 --> 01:35:57,443
That's the remote trigger.

966
01:35:57,481 --> 01:36:01,474
You see, if I press
this button here, you lose.

967
01:36:02,352 --> 01:36:04,217
And if I push this button...

968
01:36:05,589 --> 01:36:07,113
The weapon is disarmed.

969
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:10,286
Why don't you disarm it, then?

970
01:36:11,195 --> 01:36:12,628
I'm not in the mood.

971
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:14,829
Get rid of your weapon.

972
01:36:16,033 --> 01:36:17,523
Get rid of your weapon.

973
01:36:19,369 --> 01:36:20,597
Come on.

974
01:36:24,975 --> 01:36:27,739
That-a boy.
Now you can shut it down.

975
01:36:27,778 --> 01:36:29,769
You just have to
come and get it,

976
01:36:29,813 --> 01:36:32,839
and $20 that I took
from you last night...

977
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:35,775
Says that you won't.

978
01:36:39,857 --> 01:36:43,054
- You're out of your mind.
- Yeah. Ain't it cool?

979
01:36:43,093 --> 01:36:46,722
I'm serious. Your mind
has taken a walk off the map.

980
01:36:46,764 --> 01:36:49,756
Maybe, but I'm still
going to kick your ass.

981
01:37:02,613 --> 01:37:04,740
All right,
you're bleeding, aren't you?

982
01:37:04,782 --> 01:37:08,240
Good. Let's see if we can't
get more out of you.

983
01:37:11,121 --> 01:37:12,145
Uh!

984
01:37:54,598 --> 01:37:56,498
Ahh!

985
01:38:01,138 --> 01:38:03,265
Every fight used to go
to a knockout.

986
01:38:03,307 --> 01:38:05,434
Know how it feels
to be knocked out?

987
01:38:25,529 --> 01:38:27,724
Your brain presses
against your skull,

988
01:38:27,764 --> 01:38:29,459
and it feels like this.

989
01:38:41,078 --> 01:38:42,477
Ah!

990
01:39:20,651 --> 01:39:22,175
Feel anything like that?

991
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,306
I win.

992
01:41:32,249 --> 01:41:34,240
Sir, please turn around.

993
01:41:59,242 --> 01:42:01,073
My name is Riley Hale.

994
01:42:02,512 --> 01:42:03,945
Terry Carmichael.

995
01:42:05,148 --> 01:42:06,479
Pleased to meet you.

996
01:42:06,516 --> 01:42:08,950
You know, you're still
under arrest, captain.

997
01:42:08,985 --> 01:42:12,148
Oh, yeah?
I guess you better take me in.

998
01:42:13,305 --> 01:43:13,550
