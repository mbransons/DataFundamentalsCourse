1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:33,121
All right. 2:30 tomorrow.
Thank you. Goodbye.

3
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:35,737
Thanks, Sergeant.

4
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:38,147
Report of horse rations,
Thirtieth Hussars.

5
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:39,423
Regimental
and general files.

6
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:42,209
Now, each of these buttons represents troops.
Do you understand?

7
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:43,454
Yes, sir.
Good.

8
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,557
The buttons are thickest up near
the Northwest Frontier.

9
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:47,888
Oh, yes, always.

10
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,315
We have 300 million
people to protect.

11
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,749
And most of the danger
is there.

12
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:55,184
It's so romantic
to a greenhorn like me.

13
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,493
Kipling and all that,
you know.

14
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,838
Romantic?

15
00:01:58,162 --> 00:01:59,853
Well, at first, yes.

16
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:03,240
A- another button
to move.

17
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:05,929
41st Bengal Lancers.

18
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:09,769
Here, near the pass.

19
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,751
The pass?
Does that mean-

20
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,589
It means nothing
but maneuvers.

21
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:16,242
As CoI. Stone says
in his report here.

22
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,748
You hear that firing,
Hamilton?

23
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:27,546
Typical sniping fire, sir.

24
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,949
Yes, and Afridi muskets
every one of them.

25
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:32,055
Not a shot
from our detachment.

26
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,582
Good. Hendrickson's
a good soldier.

27
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,061
Rough on him,

28
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,751
having those Afridi swine
popping away at his men

29
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:40,512
and not able
to return fire.

30
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:42,954
Well, he'll get a citation
if this plan works.

31
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,281
Plan's good enough, sir,
if it were anybody but Mohammed Khan.

32
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:48,169
He's a clever dog.

33
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:51,018
Yes, of course he is.
I ought to know.

34
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:53,899
But he's nibbling
at our bait this time.

35
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:55,621
And if we can once
draw him down

36
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:58,026
out of those hills
far enough, out into the open

37
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,976
so that we can
cut off his retreat,

38
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,992
we've got him red-handed!

39
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,932
And that's what
I've been waiting for,

40
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,461
for 15 years, Hamilton.

41
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,756
Afridi swine. When do we
go into action, Hendrickson?

42
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,804
On no account return fire.
CoI. Stone's orders.

43
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:44,860
ColoneI's orders.

44
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,394
Narain Singh.

45
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:54,438
Now can we start something?

46
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:55,556
ColoneI's orders,
McGregor.

47
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:57,483
But the old fool
couldn't have foreseen this.

48
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,081
I'd like to have you
with me in a war,

49
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:00,681
but for peace time,
you're a bit too-

50
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:16,724
Too...

51
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:18,960
Too impulsive.

52
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:31,990
Machine guns!

53
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,735
Forward!

54
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,886
Most unfortunate,

55
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,584
the command
devolved upon you.

56
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,443
Of course you didn't
know my orders.

57
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:43,360
I did know them, sir.

58
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:45,089
Why didn't
you obey them?

59
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,590
You call yourself
a soldier?

60
00:05:57,997 --> 00:05:59,372
That's all.

61
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:06,986
The Colonel knows India,
McGregor. You don't.

62
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,008
You're right, I don't.

63
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,774
I'm just a fooI
Scotch-Canadian.

64
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:11,728
Came into your outfit
to get action.

65
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,427
He's got a ramrod
for a backbone.

66
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,281
He's a terror for drilling,
but when it comes to the real thing-

67
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:18,353
McGregor,
the Colonel has the right

68
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:20,979
to act as he thinks best
and say what he pleases.

69
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,102
Mount!

70
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:07,312
One more thing, sir.

71
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:10,830
Two replacements come in
today from Delhi.

72
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,555
Paperwork.

73
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:16,909
When we came into
the regiment as boys,

74
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:19,637
we didn't know that this
was 9l10ths of soldiering.

75
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,655
No.

76
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,804
We thought and acted
rather like McGregor.

77
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:24,986
Mmm.

78
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:27,418
What about
these two replacements?

79
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,863
What are they sending
to us now?

80
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,839
From the Blues:
Lt. Forsythe.

81
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:33,335
The Blues, eh? Well, that's
a fashionable regiment.

82
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,929
All spit and polish.
Who's the other one?

83
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,303
From Sandhurst:
Lt. Stone.

84
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:39,713
What?

85
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:41,271
From Sandhurst?

86
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:43,555
What, they're sending me
a young cub,

87
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:46,657
not dry behind
the ears yet? Unseasoned?

88
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,808
Straight from,
fr-from military college

89
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,056
to the Frontier?

90
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:52,068
Oh, bless me.

91
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:54,277
Hmm, what'd you say
his name was?

92
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,172
Donald Stone, sir.
Hmm.

93
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:02,213
And who asked you
to interfere

94
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:03,431
in my personal affairs?

95
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:05,193
Will you forget
that you're my coloneI

96
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:06,472
for a moment, sir?

97
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:09,196
Yes.

98
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,513
Look here, Tom.

99
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:17,075
In about two years,
you'll be retired.

100
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:19,569
So you sent for my son

101
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:21,683
because you feel sorry
for me, is that it?

102
00:08:21,756 --> 00:08:22,966
Not at all.

103
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,555
The idea was to keep
the name of Stone

104
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,831
in the 41st
after you're gone.

105
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:31,218
There's no room for
sentimentality in the army.

106
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:36,734
Hardly fair to ship him home
without a triaI.

107
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:42,180
Still, he'll measure up
to my standards,

108
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,459
or out he goes.

109
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:44,476
Of course.

110
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:46,821
And at the first sign
of favoritism,

111
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,993
from you or anyone else,

112
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:51,230
there'll be trouble.

113
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,789
And that's an order,
Maj. Hamilton.

114
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:02,415
Just as you said,
Major.

115
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:03,980
It's the ColoneI's
privilege

116
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,363
to do
and say what he likes.

117
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,583
McGregor, you'll meet
the two replacement officers this morning.

118
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:11,115
Lts. Forsythe and Stone.

119
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:12,814
Yes, sir. S-Stone?

120
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:14,731
His son.

121
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,239
His what?

122
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:17,716
I said, his son.

123
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:24,350
I can't imagine old Ramrod
ever having been that human.

124
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,602
The train arrives at 10:30,
Mr. McGregor.

125
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:29,983
Yes, sir.

126
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:40,092
Madam, you'll marry me
Tuesday the 29th.

127
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,464
Be at the church at 10:00.
That's an order.

128
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,043
Furthermore,
you're improperly dressed.

129
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:48,743
Ha, Ha.

130
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,608
Did you want
to speak to me, McGregor?

131
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,956
No, sir.

132
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,144
I hope he's a nice follow.

133
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:18,805
He won't be. Ramrod.

134
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,087
I beg your pardon?

135
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:22,577
One Stone isn't enough.
We have to have two.

136
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:29,366
There he is,
the younger Ramrod himself.

137
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,089
Everything was all right?
Thank you, sir.

138
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,997
Couldn't be anybody else.
Just as sure of himself as...

139
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,434
Look at the way
they jump around for him.

140
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,058
Look at his luggage,
everything just so-so.

141
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,159
Well, come on,
let's get it over with.

142
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,989
No, I've got
a little business.

143
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:48,064
You get
your precious replacements.

144
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:58,149
I'm McGregor, Lancers,
sent to meet you.

145
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,713
Oh, sort of
reception committee, eh?

146
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:03,438
It's nice to know
I was expected.

147
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:06,709
The regiment's been
practically breathless for a week.

148
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:07,919
Oh?

149
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,746
Traveling light, huh?

150
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:17,042
Well, you see, I did expect
to stay a little while.

151
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,997
That is if you don't
mind too much.

152
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:20,950
It's all right
with me.

153
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:23,893
Goodbye.

154
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:25,874
And thank you very much
for being so kind.

155
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:26,898
Not at all.

156
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,987
Your luggage and everything
all taken care of?

157
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,269
Everything, thank you.

158
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,833
May I present Mr. McGregor,
Miss Leys?

159
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,500
Very happy.
How do you do?

160
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:34,465
Goodbye.

161
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,840
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

162
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:39,739
Who's she?

163
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,593
I met her on the train,
if you don't mind.

164
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:45,883
Bad business talking
to strange people out here.

165
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,056
You know, this is India.

166
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:48,969
You don't know who they are,
and you might-

167
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:51,936
Oh, I see.
BeautifuI spy meets the young Lancer officer,

168
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,050
makes him give away
important military secrets.

169
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,007
The Empire goes smash.

170
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:59,981
Melodrama, my dear McGregor,
melodrama.

171
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:03,529
It might not be as funny
as it sounds, Mr. Stone.

172
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,126
I don't suppose
it matters to you,

173
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,694
but my name isn't Stone.

174
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,092
No?
No, it's Forsythe.

175
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:15,500
Well, then,
that must be Stone there.

176
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:18,428
That's very good, you know.
That's really very good.

177
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:19,922
It's almost brilliant.

178
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,466
Stone? I'm McGregor,
sent to meet you.

179
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,451
That's very nice of you.

180
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,330
Stone, meet Mister, uh...

181
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:30,811
What did you say
your name was?

182
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:32,087
Forsythe.

183
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,300
Mr. Stone, Mr. Fort.

184
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:37,755
We met on the train,
and the name is Forsythe.

185
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:40,192
Too hot for Forsythe.

186
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,561
Fort, Stone. Stone, Fort.

187
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,240
Stone Fort.
And that's funny.

188
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:51,239
If you two will hold onto each other,
I'll tend to your luggage.

189
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,280
Pleasant chap.

190
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:59,128
So friendly.

191
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,461
Isn't he?

192
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:01,903
Just what
I've always imagined

193
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:04,390
a real officer
on the Frontier would be like.

194
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:08,565
Well, my mother kept me
in the States

195
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:10,518
untiI I made her send me
to Sandhurst.

196
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,372
I've knocked about a bit
in the States.

197
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:13,781
Scotch-Canadian, myself.

198
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,214
What is this I'm in?
The Foreign Legion?

199
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:20,246
I didn't even think my father knew
I was at Sandhurst,

200
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:21,652
untiI this happened.

201
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,856
What?

202
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:24,884
His sending for me
to his regiment.

203
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:25,940
Oh?

204
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,283
Sort of, carry on
our tradition, you know?

205
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:39,004
Naim Shah,
your servant, Stone.

206
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,823
Ali Hamdi, yours.

207
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,632
The night watchman,
the water carrier, the sweeper.

208
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,463
You can hire
the rest of them later.

209
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,577
Those things hurt my ears.

210
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:02,631
That's odd.

211
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:05,323
They sound to me
like a Scotch bagpipe.

212
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,388
Your quarters, Stone.

213
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:32,730
Pretty, huh? And soothing.
Thought I might entertain you.

214
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:35,326
Wild Scotch airs.
Remind you of home.

215
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:37,698
Your room.

216
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:40,642
Someone deeded
all this junk

217
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,596
to the South
Kensington Museum?

218
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:45,889
That junk represents
the personal belongings

219
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:47,872
of the man you're replacing.

220
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,889
Killed on the border
last month.

221
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,653
Oh, I'm sorry.

222
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:02,192
Oh, McGregor, did my...

223
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:05,927
Uh, the Colonel say anything
about what time he'd see me?

224
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:08,904
No, he didn't. And my guess is
he won't see you till durbar.

225
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:10,122
Oh.

226
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,503
Don't let that
get you down.

227
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,609
The old- The old man's
a stickler for red tape.

228
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,196
Durbar. Bugles.

229
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:37,368
And that's an order.
Ramrod.

230
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,618
Durbar.

231
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:46,303
Oh, a-already?
I'll be right with you.

232
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,160
I want you to help me

233
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:49,763
to keep them
in good condition.

234
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,337
You keep then shined

235
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:52,997
and I'II, uh,
keep them dirty.

236
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,824
Durbar.

237
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,187
Whenever you're ready,
sahib.

238
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,456
Thanks,
old ColoniaI.

239
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,574
Durbar, Barrett.

240
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,330
Not today, old boy.

241
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:11,828
Where to now?

242
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:13,488
Over the border.

243
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:16,594
I wish
I'd taken my mother's advice

244
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,605
and joined the church
instead of the Army.

245
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,857
I wish
I had the job.

246
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,676
Does the Colonel think you're
the only one here who talks Pushtu?

247
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,237
Who knows
what the Colonel thinks?

248
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,278
I agree with you there.
Well, good luck.

249
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,202
Thanks, Mac.

250
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,890
Left wheel, turn!

251
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,569
Left wheel, turn!

252
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,664
Good head, eh? Yeah.

253
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,071
How old is she, Major?

254
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:57,381
Places, men.

255
00:16:58,538 --> 00:16:59,855
Good morning,
gentlemen.

256
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:02,026
Good morning, sir.

257
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,524
What's this?

258
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:38,292
An Afridi Ghazi,
Colonel sahib.

259
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:41,464
Caught in the quarters
of Capt. Norton, with this.

260
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:42,843
Anything stolen?

261
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,054
He meant to kill
Capt. Norton.

262
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,424
Said Capt. Norton slept
with his feet toward Mecca.

263
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:53,023
There are trees,
and we have rope.

264
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:54,785
What have you got to say?

265
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,250
Oh.

266
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,034
Take him
and hang him to a tree,

267
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:07,303
and then sew the dead body
in the skin of a pig.

268
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:24,750
Well, that's what will happen
to him if he tries it again.

269
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,285
You tell him that
and let him go.

270
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:34,673
He doesn't seem to
like pigs.

271
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:35,969
If that happened, in heaven

272
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:38,906
he wouldn't get the 48 maidens
allotted by Allah.

273
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:40,257
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Sad.

274
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:43,806
Capt. Norton.

275
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:45,568
Yes, sir?
Have you a compass?

276
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:46,881
Yes, sir.

277
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,115
Change the direction
of your bed.

278
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:50,465
Yes, sir.

279
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,124
Yes, that's all.

280
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:55,064
Mr. McGregor.

281
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,079
The two replacements?

282
00:18:58,915 --> 00:19:00,968
Mr. Forsythe,
from the Blues,

283
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,294
Mr. Stone,
from Sandhurst.

284
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,331
From the Blues, eh?
Quite so.

285
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,560
Well, that's
a fashionable regiment.

286
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:14,152
I am afraid, Mr. Forsythe,
you'll find us different.

287
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:15,751
We have a reputation
as soldiers,

288
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,067
and we're proud of it.

289
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:20,878
Mr. Stone.

290
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,308
You've come to us
direct from Sandhurst,

291
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,290
without previous service.

292
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,771
Is that correct?

293
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:29,014
Yes, sir.

294
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,183
Yes. Well, you've got
a great deal to learn.

295
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:34,551
And I trust that you,

296
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:36,693
and you, too,
Mr. Forsythe,

297
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:38,903
will measure up
to our requirements.

298
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,763
That's all, gentlemen.

299
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:54,658
Crusty old...

300
00:19:55,658 --> 00:19:56,999
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:00,834
Is it over?
Is that all?

302
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,791
That's all.

303
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,635
Lt. Stone.

304
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:10,845
Yes, sir?

305
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:21,970
The Colonel forgot something.

306
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:23,467
I want you
to take this to him.

307
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:28,947
Yes, sir.

308
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:39,457
What's so funny?
You are.

309
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:42,784
So the rough soldier
has a heart of gold.

310
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,331
Never mind,
it comes out in all of us.

311
00:20:46,404 --> 00:20:47,386
It's the mother instinct.

312
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:10,922
Is this it, sir?

313
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,873
What?

314
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,106
Where did you
get this?

315
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:27,150
Mr. McGregor ordered me
to give it to you, sir.

316
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:29,052
What infernal impudence!

317
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:30,906
No, uh, not you.

318
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,336
Not-not-not you.

319
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:37,178
How's, uh,
How- H-How's your mother?

320
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:39,258
Quite well, sir.

321
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:40,700
Good, good.

322
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,964
She always
hated the army.

323
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:45,180
I- I don't understand
why she ever let you

324
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:46,487
go through Sandhurst.

325
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:48,514
She had to.

326
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,580
I've kept after her about it
ever since I was so high.

327
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:53,829
Oh? Wanted to be
a soldier, eh?

328
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,452
We've always been soldiers,
for generations.

329
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:57,766
Yes.

330
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:00,322
Still, you're not one yet,
you know?

331
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:01,959
Yes, sir.

332
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:04,806
Really, you, uh,
you ought not to be here.

333
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,817
Uh, not on the Frontier.

334
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:08,897
But I am here, sir.

335
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,598
Yes, but, uh,
don't try to take advantage.

336
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,192
Don't expect
any favoritism.

337
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,476
I don't, sir.

338
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:16,913
I, uh,
I- I-I'm glad to see you,

339
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:18,223
of course, and I...

340
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:21,078
I'm sorry that the situation
makes any sort of,

341
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:25,267
uh, o-of, uh,
social relation impossible.

342
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:30,000
And I-I, uh...

343
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:31,990
No, no, wait! W-wait.

344
00:22:32,055 --> 00:22:33,965
Uh, come back a moment.

345
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:38,584
You see, uh,
this Frontier,

346
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:40,894
it's not the same
as home service.

347
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,366
No place for a Cub.

348
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,476
A man's got
to be seasoned.

349
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:46,687
You've got to start
from the bottom.

350
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:49,657
Learn everything,
and if you don't measure up,

351
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:50,876
out.

352
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:52,858
The service
comes first.

353
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,577
Something your mother
never understood.

354
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,524
Yes, sir.

355
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:01,610
Is that all, sir?

356
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:03,977
What? Uh, uh, yes.

357
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:06,952
Y- Yes, that's all.
That's all.

358
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:10,961
I'm very glad to see...

359
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:28,245
Poor kid.

360
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:30,639
I thought
if I got them alone...

361
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:33,719
But the old man
has ice-water in his veins.

362
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,481
You don't know
the colonel, McGregor.

363
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,760
Neither do you.

364
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,456
Mr. McGregor.
Yes, sir.

365
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:41,210
As I remarked to one of
my other officers this morning,

366
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,278
there is no place for
sentimentality in the Army.

367
00:23:44,702 --> 00:23:46,293
Neither sentimentality

368
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,480
nor impertinence,
Mr. McGregor.

369
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:07,079
Stone.

370
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:14,992
Interesting, the durbar,
isn't it?

371
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,292
I'm sorry
I sent you in there.

372
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:18,824
I should have known better.

373
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:20,786
Should have known
how he'd treat you.

374
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,225
What's a son to him,

375
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,637
compared to
his blasted regiment?

376
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:24,882
Martinet. Ramrod.

377
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:26,513
That's what he is.
Everybody knows it.

378
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:27,926
You might as well
get used to it.

379
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:29,487
That's a lie.

380
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:33,168
I'm sorry,

381
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,455
I can't keep my mouth shut.
That's my trouble.

382
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:39,133
Biggest fooI in the Army.
I'm sorry.

383
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:42,517
That's all-
all right, Mac.

384
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:50,972
" Sure I love the dear silver
that shines in her hair "

385
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:53,409
" And the brow
that's all furrowed "

386
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:55,038
" and wrinkled with care "

387
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:02,689
" Oh, God bless you
and keep you "

388
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:04,936
" Mother McGregor "

389
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:15,378
Now, when a troop wheels
on the move,

390
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:17,834
what do the troop leaders
look out for?

391
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,464
Mr. Stone,
I asked you a question.

392
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:20,520
Yes, sir.

393
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,938
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.

394
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:28,626
Got it all that time.

395
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:29,646
All right.

396
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:45,622
Bedding should be
changed, Mr. Stone.

397
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:48,124
Yes, I see now,
Risaldar Major.

398
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,783
We don't have these
beastly ticks in England.

399
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,909
Sergeant, have this
horse's shoe attended to.

400
00:25:58,822 --> 00:26:00,415
Come on!

401
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,014
Give him a good walk
while he cools off.

402
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:20,680
A good man, Forsythe.

403
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:22,315
Jump!

404
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,390
See the way
he took that jump?

405
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,914
Yes, they teach them
to jump in the Blues.

406
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:29,586
Yes. Yes, what?

407
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:31,633
Oh.

408
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:40,373
Good work, Forsythe.

409
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:41,975
Thank you, sir.

410
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:46,107
Mr. McGregor,
you're improperly dressed.

411
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,516
I'm sorry, sir.

412
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,977
That was a nice jump
you made, Mac.

413
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:01,256
Thanks.
Hello, Stone.

414
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:02,273
Hello.

415
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:03,942
Remarkable man,
your father.

416
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:05,988
Knows a good soldier
when he sees one.

417
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:08,234
Appreciates neatness, too.

418
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:11,143
Well,
how about a spot of scotch?

419
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,987
Thanks. I haven't finished
inspection yet.

420
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:17,066
Ten minutes for their backs
and five for their bellies.

421
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,211
That's the order
of grooming.

422
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:22,054
Very touching,
the lad's devotion.

423
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:25,367
Must warm the maternaI
cockles of your heart.

424
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:26,547
Eh, McGregor?

425
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:35,633
What about pulling
a few pegs with me, huh?

426
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:38,192
I'm in favor of it.
Let's go.

427
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,957
Well, uh,
how about 10 Rupees?

428
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,041
Make it 20.

429
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:47,557
Ready?

430
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:48,703
Whenever you say.

431
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:10,241
They should make
those pegs smaller.

432
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:11,786
Be more sport to it,
huh?

433
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:16,301
" Oh, he flew
through the air "

434
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:18,227
" With the greatest
of ease "

435
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:22,253
" And the daring young man
owes me 20 Rupees "

436
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:46,300
Have some tea, Stone?

437
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:47,776
No, thanks.

438
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:59,179
Call it for first
in the bath.

439
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:00,174
Heads.

440
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,186
Right.

441
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,946
You fellows bathe
to keep cooI

442
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:06,508
and I bathe
because I badly need it.

443
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,413
Every time I do this

444
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,239
I remind myself
of my old man.

445
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,452
Whiskers.

446
00:29:36,155 --> 00:29:37,944
He was a crabby old cuss.

447
00:29:38,138 --> 00:29:40,244
Back in Alberta
I had a colt once.

448
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,066
Lot of class and nerve.

449
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:45,368
You could tell
he was no carthorse

450
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:46,824
when he was a yearling.

451
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:49,600
The old man hooked him
to a plow.

452
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:52,677
Took all the spirit
out of him.

453
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,519
He broke him in,
as he said he would

454
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,829
and I never forgave him
for it.

455
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,613
I don't think the horse
ever did realize what...

456
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,752
what the old man
did to him.

457
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:05,217
So I'm the horse.

458
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,393
Very subtle, Mac.

459
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:09,245
What the blazes do you mean?

460
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,367
I'm no two-year-old. I'm 21.

461
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,292
And if anybody thinks
my old man's going to break my nerve-

462
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:16,659
What are you talking about?
I wasn't thinking of you at all.

463
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:18,067
And let me tell
you another thing,

464
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,850
I don't need a nurse.
Now you can go on shaving.

465
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:27,571
Have a little soap.
You need it.

466
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:47,995
Do you have to do that?

467
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,579
Why, like you, I have
a softer side to my nature.

468
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:55,005
It finds its outlet in music.
See? The scales.

469
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,177
Hey, Mac, get me a towel,
will you?

470
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:02,728
Variations,
one hand, Mac.

471
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:04,516
Listen, Forsythe.

472
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:07,690
This Mother Machree business
has gone far enough.

473
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:10,118
Why, of course, Mac.

474
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:12,100
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it.

475
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:15,174
Well, let's, uh,
just forget all about it. Hm?

476
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:16,261
Thanks.

477
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,025
Hey, Mac,
that soap's in my eyes.

478
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:20,102
Give me a towel,
will you?

479
00:31:50,754 --> 00:31:51,998
McGregor.

480
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,730
Variations, two hands, Mac.

481
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:38,198
How long are you
going to...

482
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:44,216
Keep playing.

483
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,670
Variations, Mr. Forsythe,
with both hands.

484
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,604
Cobras have
a softer side, too.

485
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:53,689
Finds an outlet in music.

486
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,835
Of course,
if you-if you stop playing,

487
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:59,529
You know, you might live
a couple of hours.

488
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:02,343
I had a friend once
that lived for two days.

489
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,902
Try it with one hand.

490
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:11,241
Mac!

491
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,413
Allow me.
You might spill it.

492
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:39,766
For sale, cheap.

493
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:42,523
One secondhand
musical instrument.

494
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:49,153
200 feet more.

495
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,747
Plus 200 east.

496
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,986
Elevation, 300.

497
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:55,458
Mr. McGregor.
Yes, sir?

498
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:57,466
There's no word
yet from Barrett.

499
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,204
We must get in touch with him.
Yes, sir.

500
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:00,932
You're familiar
with the roads north east

501
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:01,984
of Fort Jamrud?

502
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:03,585
I am, sir.
Yes, good, good.

503
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:05,316
You'll cross
the Frontier tonight.

504
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:06,727
Take one subaltern,

505
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:10,291
one NCO, 10 men,
four spare horses.

506
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:12,463
And, uh, rifles.

507
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,219
Not lances.

508
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:15,303
I see, sir.

509
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:18,057
Ostensibly,
a hunting expedition.

510
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:19,916
What subaltern
shall I take, sir?

511
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:21,327
Mmm,
any preference?

512
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:23,859
Mr. Stone, sir.

513
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:27,980
No service experience.
Take Morgan.

514
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,329
He's on leave, sir.

515
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:30,773
Well, then, take Forsythe.

516
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:32,363
Yes, sir.

517
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:33,835
Here are your orders.

518
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:37,947
And this time,
obey them.

519
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:39,350
Yes, sir.

520
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,164
Forsythe.

521
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:47,186
Huh?

522
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:50,681
We're leaving for
the border immediately.

523
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,803
What?

524
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:54,715
Action?

525
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,442
Can't say.

526
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:57,458
Oh.

527
00:34:57,534 --> 00:34:59,140
We leave
for the border?

528
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:02,600
Uh, small expedition.
Only one junior officer.

529
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,127
Forsythe.
Yes?

530
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:07,046
One junior officer,
so he had to choose-

531
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:08,675
I chose Forsythe.

532
00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:11,523
I see.

533
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,390
Sir.

534
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:24,114
What do you mean by
intruding like this?

535
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:25,907
Why wasn't I chosen
to go with McGregor?

536
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:27,797
Are you questioning
my orders?

537
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:29,488
Then it was your orders.

538
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,282
It wasn't McGregor's choice.
It was yours.

539
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:32,279
Mr. Stone.

540
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:33,870
I came out to India
to be an officer,

541
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:35,253
and I've been given
things to do

542
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:37,229
I learned in my first year
at Sandhurst.

543
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,960
I haven't asked any favors,
and I'm not asking any now.

544
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:41,590
But if you meant to
treat me this way,

545
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,156
why did you
bring me out here?

546
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,852
Why did you send for me?

547
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,402
I didn't send for you.

548
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:47,994
Y- you didn't?

549
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:51,323
Oh.

550
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,810
Are you aware
we're being shot at?

551
00:36:26,673 --> 00:36:27,818
We camp here.

552
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:29,553
This is no place to camp.

553
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:42,106
Are you
out of your mind?

554
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:44,313
They'll rush us in the night
and slit our throats.

555
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:46,455
This can't be
what the Colonel meant.

556
00:36:46,526 --> 00:36:48,566
Easy to see how much
you learned in the Blues

557
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:49,718
about Frontier fighting.

558
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:02,629
No firing.

559
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,488
He's mine.

560
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:09,573
Rapid fire!

561
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:24,120
You just missed my ear, Mac.

562
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:25,457
You're lucky, Barrett.

563
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:26,738
You got a cigarette?

564
00:37:26,808 --> 00:37:27,823
Yeah.

565
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,663
Thanks.

566
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,811
What shall I tell
the ColoneI?

567
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:36,525
Mohammed Khan,

568
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,277
is effecting a coalition
of all the tribes.

569
00:37:42,649 --> 00:37:45,807
But don't forget, Colonel,
GopaI's a friendly state.

570
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:48,964
The Emir's our friend,
as who knows better than you.

571
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,745
Oh, of course, I've known
Othman Ali for 20 years.

572
00:37:51,814 --> 00:37:53,275
Every year or so
I take the regiment

573
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,716
up to Gopal for
maneuvers and pig-sticking.

574
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:58,398
He's got the best wild pig
north of the Ganges.

575
00:37:58,469 --> 00:37:59,418
Ah.

576
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,949
But two million
rounds of ammunition.

577
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:03,199
Oh, no, Woodley.

578
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:05,538
Why, that's enough
to start a small-sized war.

579
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:08,163
And then, who knows?

580
00:38:11,026 --> 00:38:13,263
Yes, who knows?

581
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,324
But he asked for it.

582
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,848
And if we refused, well,
he mightn't be our friend.

583
00:38:20,914 --> 00:38:22,474
And so he gets it, eh?
Yes.

584
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:24,907
McGregor, Sahib.

585
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:26,505
Oh, ask Mr. McGregor
to come in.

586
00:38:26,578 --> 00:38:28,072
Oh, sit down, sir,
won't you?

587
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,363
You saw Barrett?
Yes, sir.

588
00:38:38,431 --> 00:38:41,278
He reports Mohammed Khan
is trying to stir up all the border tribes,

589
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:42,904
and effect
a coalition of all of them.

590
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:44,764
They're listening
to him as he's promised

591
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:46,392
to supply them
with machine guns,

592
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:47,990
and two million
rounds of ammunition.

593
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,176
Ammunition?

594
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,740
Oh, that's good work.
Thank you, McGregor.

595
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:53,237
Thank Barrett, sir.

596
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,915
Look at here, sir, I-I know
it's none of my business,

597
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:00,330
but couldn't we
slip out of here,

598
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:02,501
a small detachment of us,
anyway, on our own?

599
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:04,099
Try to get a chance
at him, kill him,

600
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:06,278
and-and nip the whole
business in the bud?

601
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:08,298
Are you suggesting

602
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:10,885
that I should commence
hostilities without orders?

603
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,068
And, uh, ahem,
without reporting this

604
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:14,212
to the Intelligence?

605
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:16,706
Intelligence, those fools.
General staff?

606
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,169
You know, sir, they'll send us
anywhere but into action.

607
00:39:19,244 --> 00:39:21,913
To Gopal to stick pigs
for instance, like last summer.

608
00:39:21,982 --> 00:39:23,766
An excellent suggestion.

609
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:28,313
Sir Thomas,
Mr. McGregor.

610
00:39:29,206 --> 00:39:32,784
Mr. McGregor, Maj. Gen.
Sir Thomas Woodley.

611
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:37,008
Chief of Intelligence.
Army Headquarters.

612
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:39,443
Mr. McGregor.

613
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:45,859
CoI. Stone, your regiment
will leave at dawn for GopaI.

614
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:47,480
Yes, sir.

615
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:49,658
Now, get yourself
a couple of hours sleep.

616
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,039
We leave at 6:00.

617
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,595
Yes, sir.

618
00:39:54,114 --> 00:39:55,641
Wish I could go with you.

619
00:39:55,715 --> 00:39:57,242
I always liked pig-sticking.

620
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,329
Pig-sticking.

621
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:01,500
Well, I seem to remember
feeling that way once.

622
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:02,553
He's probably right.

623
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:03,575
Hm.

624
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,210
But he brought
our answer, Stone.

625
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:08,129
A plain two and two
that makes a very plain four.

626
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:12,289
Mohammed Khan needs
two million rounds of ammunition.

627
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:14,986
And the Emir of Gopal asks us
for two million rounds-

628
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:17,226
Yes, yes, and it's not
difficult to guess,

629
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:19,946
that Mohammed Khan persuaded
the Emir to ask for it.

630
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:22,382
He knows we'll have
to let him have it, too.

631
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:24,846
And GopaI's not only remote,

632
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:28,041
but far enough removed
from the Khan's home fires,

633
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:29,704
that we shouldn't
be suspicious.

634
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:31,336
Very pretty, indeed.

635
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:33,412
And it becomes
our very pleasant job,

636
00:40:33,484 --> 00:40:34,682
to see that the Emir

637
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,498
really is the one
who gets the ammunition.

638
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:38,320
That old pussy-footer

639
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,306
gets paid for
being intelligent.

640
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:42,908
I tell you, Forsythe,
everything's going to smash.

641
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:43,920
What?

642
00:40:43,996 --> 00:40:44,923
Pig-sticking.

643
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:47,771
We're going to ride all around Gopal
sticking toothpicks into pigs.

644
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,396
Sounds rather fun.

645
00:40:49,468 --> 00:40:51,705
I ought to be rather good
at that, don't you think?

646
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:52,852
Hmm.

647
00:40:52,924 --> 00:40:55,706
By the way, McGregor,
I've got bad news for you.

648
00:40:56,124 --> 00:40:59,299
Your ward needs
parental controI, I fear.

649
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:00,607
That is, if you can find him.

650
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:03,393
Naim Shah tells me he's been
out every night since we left.

651
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:05,537
Rolling home
to quarters blotto.

652
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:07,682
Tonight he's still
out on a binge.

653
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:13,188
Hm. We leave for
Gopal in two hours.

654
00:41:13,673 --> 00:41:16,739
Oh, without Stone, it appears.

655
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,809
My, what will
the stern father say?

656
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,629
You'd better do
something about it, Mac.

657
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:25,005
The young fooI.

658
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:27,079
Let old Ramrod do
what he likes with his son.

659
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,547
It's no concern of mine.
I'm going to bed.

660
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:31,891
So am I.

661
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:55,899
What are you doing here?

662
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,175
The same as you are.
Looking for him.

663
00:41:58,244 --> 00:41:59,934
And I wish you'd be
honest with yourself,

664
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:02,175
and let me know
what you're really going to do.

665
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:04,828
If you'd just tell me,
maybe I'd get more sleep.

666
00:42:07,203 --> 00:42:09,110
Now that we are here,

667
00:42:09,184 --> 00:42:11,335
what would you do
if you were drunk?

668
00:42:11,594 --> 00:42:12,707
How drunk?

669
00:42:13,354 --> 00:42:14,598
Pretty drunk.

670
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:17,161
I'd go looking
for that music.

671
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,036
Come on, speed it up, Stone,

672
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:26,631
or we'll all be
doing stable duty.

673
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,592
I can take care of myself.

674
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:29,928
Come along, Casanova,

675
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,495
these will make
a new man of you.

676
00:43:11,626 --> 00:43:13,033
Forgot something.

677
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,013
I thought you
might get lonesome.

678
00:43:15,082 --> 00:43:16,741
Get yourself a cobra.

679
00:43:35,671 --> 00:43:37,875
The welcoming committee
from the Emir.

680
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:47,100
That's his vizier,
bringing gifts

681
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:49,883
for the ColoneI
from his old paI.

682
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:56,916
His Highness,

683
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,746
Othman Ali Bahadur,
Emir of Gopal,

684
00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:01,787
bids welcome to his friends
and allies of the Raj.

685
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,038
Welcome, huzoor,

686
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,082
thrice welcome,
in the name of Allah.

687
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:07,044
Convey my thanks
to your master,

688
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:08,668
ahem, my old friend.

689
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:11,654
Uh, m-may he live
a thousand years.

690
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:14,440
His Highness orders me
to express his wish, huzoor,

691
00:44:14,507 --> 00:44:17,540
that you may live long enough
to be present at his funeraI.

692
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:19,466
Uh, oh, yes, quite so.
Quite so.

693
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,633
He went the old man
one better that time.

694
00:44:21,707 --> 00:44:23,780
Wicked looking birds,
aren't they?

695
00:44:24,945 --> 00:44:26,603
Hunting falcons, Forsythe.

696
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:28,013
Swiftest thing in the air.

697
00:44:28,081 --> 00:44:29,608
Full of fight
and trained to kill,

698
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:31,950
like the rest of these
mangy-looking fellows.

699
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,617
A long-legged man
is always full of wind.

700
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,130
Barrett.

701
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:43,158
His Highness
invites you, huzoor,

702
00:44:43,224 --> 00:44:45,559
and all the officer sahibs,
to an entertainment

703
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:47,151
in your honor,
tonight at the palace.

704
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:49,300
I accept on their
behalf with pleasure.

705
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:51,130
All my thanks
to His Highness.

706
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,165
His Highness awaits you.

707
00:45:24,017 --> 00:45:25,927
Salaam, Colonel Sahib.

708
00:45:26,002 --> 00:45:27,627
Salaam, Your Highness.

709
00:45:36,594 --> 00:45:39,764
May I present the officers of the 41st
Bengal Lancers, Your Highness?

710
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:45,928
My poor hovel is yours,
sahiban.

711
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:48,404
Everything here
is for your pleasure.

712
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:50,526
Please enjoy yourselves.

713
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:54,486
Now, this is what
army life should be.

714
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,934
Like the Arabian Nights,
isn't it?

715
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:57,787
Anything like this
in Canada, Mac?

716
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,283
Quite a teepee, huh?

717
00:46:11,627 --> 00:46:13,929
I sent to London
for that, and you-

718
00:46:22,444 --> 00:46:25,673
My two good friends.
My guest, CoI. Stone.

719
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:28,034
My guest, Mohammed Khan.

720
00:46:28,364 --> 00:46:30,312
Very glad to
know you Khan sahib.

721
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:31,946
At last, CoI. Stone.

722
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,891
We almost met once before,
did we not, you and I?

723
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,059
Yes, I-I believe we did.
Just missed you, didn't I?

724
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,431
A blind man wants
nothing except his eyes.

725
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:44,177
That's an Afghan proverb.

726
00:46:44,952 --> 00:46:46,643
And now,
if you will forgive me,

727
00:46:46,713 --> 00:46:48,852
I must leave
my two good friends together.

728
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:50,776
I must go to see
my other guests.

729
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,888
Oh, yes,
Your Highness.

730
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:54,267
No doubt that Khan and I
will find much to talk about.

731
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:56,724
Highness.

732
00:46:57,462 --> 00:46:59,748
You were not expected
with your lancers.

733
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:01,760
A hasty trip, wasn't it?

734
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,171
In search of, uh...

735
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,350
Pigs.

736
00:47:08,646 --> 00:47:10,107
There's another proverb:

737
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:13,531
The little jackal barks,
but the caravan passes.

738
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:16,930
Won't you sit down,
CoI. Stone?

739
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:18,717
Yes.

740
00:47:26,003 --> 00:47:27,279
I say, look.

741
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:36,848
I saw her first.

742
00:47:36,914 --> 00:47:38,638
No, no, no,
no, no, no, Mac.

743
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,325
A direct frontal attack?

744
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:44,048
That's the wrong tactics.
This requires finesse.

745
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:51,318
I'll toss you.
The loser stays clear.

746
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:54,557
Right you are.

747
00:47:57,312 --> 00:47:58,359
Heads.

748
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,905
Now watch closely.

749
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:13,666
Well, uh, go ahead.
Uh, I'm watching you closely.

750
00:48:17,036 --> 00:48:18,214
Gentlemen.

751
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:21,030
Uh, two more of my officers
I should like you to meet.

752
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:22,759
Mr. McGregor, Mr. Forsythe.

753
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:25,480
This is our friend
and neighbor, Mohammed Khan.

754
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:29,065
A great pleasure,
gentlemen.

755
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,245
Let me give you some
advice, Mr. Forsythe.

756
00:48:36,377 --> 00:48:38,450
Never make fun of
military Intelligence.

757
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:40,790
Thank you very much.
And now-

758
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:42,068
Uh, wait a minute.

759
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:45,173
That girI and...

760
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,817
I've got some things
to find out.

761
00:48:53,466 --> 00:48:55,538
He plans to leave
tomorrow morning.

762
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,563
I knew he would
as soon as we got here.

763
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:01,246
We must keep him
here if possible.

764
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:02,464
I was right.

765
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:03,876
She came here
with Mohammed Khan.

766
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:05,950
Aha, so that's how it is.

767
00:49:06,022 --> 00:49:08,161
Diplomatic complications
rear their heads, huh?

768
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:09,758
Looks like it.
We'd better find them.

769
00:49:09,831 --> 00:49:12,002
Mac, I've been thinking.

770
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:14,176
I'm very fond
of you, you know.

771
00:49:15,591 --> 00:49:18,242
I have a feeling this is
going to cost me something.

772
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:19,740
Oh, no, Mac.

773
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:21,494
Now, you've done
enough for him, really.

774
00:49:21,562 --> 00:49:23,175
This time, I'll take
on the rescue work.

775
00:49:23,246 --> 00:49:24,429
Well, that
touches me deeply,

776
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,638
but how many times have you
told me he was my job?

777
00:49:26,707 --> 00:49:28,879
Uh, we'll both
do it, Mac. Huh?

778
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,456
Mr. Stone,
I'm sorry, but uh,

779
00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:35,532
but Maj. Hamilton
wants to see you.

780
00:49:35,603 --> 00:49:36,945
Very important,
he said.

781
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,209
I beg your pardon. I'll be
back in just a moment.

782
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:41,323
Surely.

783
00:49:43,604 --> 00:49:45,631
No manners at all,
this younger generation.

784
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:47,698
Completely forgot
the introductions, didn't he?

785
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:48,753
My name's Forsythe.

786
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:49,815
How do you do?

787
00:49:51,777 --> 00:49:53,086
That's McGregor.

788
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:55,798
Scotch, you know.
Very queer race.

789
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:00,983
Did you send for me, Major?

790
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:02,005
No.

791
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,665
I'm sorry.

792
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:07,612
I made that same mistake
once before.

793
00:50:41,755 --> 00:50:43,543
How are your pigs
this year, Highness?

794
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,592
Pigs?

795
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:47,571
My land is overrun
with unclean beasts.

796
00:50:47,642 --> 00:50:49,649
Oh, that means
good sport tomorrow.

797
00:50:50,778 --> 00:50:53,145
You'll join us,
Khan sahib, of course?

798
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,999
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm leaving in the morning.

799
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:57,640
But if you wish real sport,
you must come to my country.

800
00:50:57,709 --> 00:50:59,008
An invitation?

801
00:50:59,074 --> 00:51:02,107
My land and all it contains
is at your disposaI.

802
00:51:02,177 --> 00:51:03,290
Yes, yes, sahib.

803
00:51:03,362 --> 00:51:06,499
Why, he gives his word,
the word of a prince.

804
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:07,997
I swear it
upon the Koran.

805
00:51:08,072 --> 00:51:09,086
An oath?

806
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:10,436
Oh, I'll put it
to the test.

807
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:14,116
He has you.

808
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:17,700
What do you
demand of him, sahib?

809
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:19,328
Postpone your departure.

810
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,245
Join us at
pig-sticking tomorrow.

811
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:23,947
I- I-I can't.
My affairs demand that-

812
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:25,160
You must.

813
00:51:25,231 --> 00:51:27,271
You give your oath
upon the Koran.

814
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:30,830
I am honored, Bahadur.

815
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:33,042
Tomorrow,

816
00:51:33,748 --> 00:51:34,893
Pig-sticking.

817
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:47,990
I don't believe
in explaining orders,

818
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:49,717
but this time
it's necessary.

819
00:51:50,395 --> 00:51:52,948
Mohammed Khan's men
are in these hills,

820
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:55,552
to seize that
ammunition convoy

821
00:51:56,065 --> 00:51:58,073
before it reaches
our friend, the Emir.

822
00:51:58,146 --> 00:52:01,528
There's no need to tell you
how serious one ill-advised

823
00:52:01,602 --> 00:52:04,319
or careless move
by any of you

824
00:52:04,993 --> 00:52:06,716
might be in this situation.

825
00:52:06,786 --> 00:52:10,064
Oh, of course, we're here
for sport and maneuvers.

826
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,128
And as some of you who are
new to India may not know,

827
00:52:13,193 --> 00:52:15,265
a wounded pig
is a dangerous animal,

828
00:52:15,944 --> 00:52:19,011
so a word of advice
to, uh, the younger officers.

829
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:21,508
If you wound a pig
and he takes to cover,

830
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:24,038
do not dismount and follow.

831
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:26,059
Foolhardiness is not courage.

832
00:52:26,862 --> 00:52:30,507
It's not good soldiering
and it's not good sport.

833
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,757
Good morning, sir.

834
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:41,204
Good morning.
Good morning.

835
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,480
We shall ride
together, sir?

836
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:44,045
It will be a pleasure.

837
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:49,332
You have the advantage
of me, in years.

838
00:52:49,404 --> 00:52:51,705
The older the English fox,
the safer his brush.

839
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:53,233
Cunning comes with age,
CoI. Stone.

840
00:52:53,307 --> 00:52:54,834
Hunted in the shires, I see.

841
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:57,800
And you on the border.
We're fairly matched.

842
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,667
But I prefer
your English sport to this.

843
00:53:01,218 --> 00:53:03,193
You prefer hunting the fox?

844
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,677
Mr. Stone.

845
00:53:14,857 --> 00:53:16,384
I'm worried about you.

846
00:53:16,744 --> 00:53:18,337
Such a dangerous sport.

847
00:53:18,472 --> 00:53:20,539
Nonsense. Why,
there's no risk at all.

848
00:53:20,673 --> 00:53:22,188
Good luck.

849
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:06,011
Old Ramrod's spotted one.
Look at him ride.

850
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:13,640
He made a direct kill.

851
00:54:13,706 --> 00:54:14,654
Look!

852
00:54:15,913 --> 00:54:17,823
20 Rupees on the first spear.
Right.

853
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:40,018
" Oh, he flew through the air
with the greatest of ease "

854
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:41,873
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

855
00:54:47,222 --> 00:54:49,332
Did you see old Ramrod
make that kill?

856
00:54:49,403 --> 00:54:51,641
"A wounded pig is
a dangerous animaI."

857
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:52,755
What rot.

858
00:54:52,893 --> 00:54:54,234
Pig hasn't a chance.

859
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,380
Think so?

860
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:58,464
Hey, look.

861
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,553
There's your chance to
find out how simple it is.

862
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:20,123
Stone!

863
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:27,947
Mr. McGregor!
Mr. McGregor!

864
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:29,871
You get back on your
horse and stay there.

865
00:55:32,113 --> 00:55:34,502
Mr. Stone! Mr. Stone!

866
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,927
McGregor,
give me your tunic.

867
00:56:27,466 --> 00:56:30,767
No one, you understand,
no one,

868
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,058
must know of this.

869
00:56:33,378 --> 00:56:34,613
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

870
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,349
Mr. Stone, you've seen fit
to disregard my advice.

871
00:56:44,503 --> 00:56:47,220
You will please be good
enough to leave the field.

872
00:56:49,655 --> 00:56:50,866
Yes, sir.

873
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,558
I, uh, I-I should
thank you two.

874
00:57:07,396 --> 00:57:09,632
Well, thank you,
gentlemen.

875
00:57:11,332 --> 00:57:13,633
Now, uh, help me
on my horse.

876
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,626
And you, too,
disobeyed my orders.

877
00:57:23,697 --> 00:57:26,697
I distinctly told
you not to dismount.

878
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:47,163
Lights out.

879
00:57:49,087 --> 00:57:50,297
How do you
feel, sir?

880
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:52,952
I, oh, oh, quite
all right, thanks.

881
00:57:53,023 --> 00:57:54,299
They'll be
over at once.

882
00:57:54,366 --> 00:57:55,348
What?

883
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,318
Much better talk to them
yourself, I think, sir.

884
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:01,401
He's your son, you know.

885
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,023
Better effect than
if it came from me.

886
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,002
And when you talk,

887
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:10,286
I happen to know there's
quite a strong friendship

888
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,776
between the boy
and McGregor.

889
00:58:12,331 --> 00:58:14,819
Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.
Of course, yes.

890
00:58:15,467 --> 00:58:16,809
Well, all right.

891
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:18,953
They're here.

892
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:21,542
Well, all right.

893
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:23,585
Come in.

894
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:28,994
Oh, yes, yes, of course,
it's you. Yes, I-I...

895
00:58:29,515 --> 00:58:30,824
G- Good evening, gentlemen.

896
00:58:30,891 --> 00:58:32,475
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, sir.

897
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:34,805
Yes, I, uh,
I- I-I sent for you.

898
00:58:35,864 --> 00:58:38,231
I- I want to talk
to you about something. Uh...

899
00:58:38,266 --> 00:58:40,467
Uh, sit down.
S- sit down, both of you.

900
00:58:44,186 --> 00:58:46,008
No, no, no,
don't go, Hamilton.

901
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:50,355
It, um, it's about,
uh, um...

902
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,909
Are your quarters
comfortable?

903
00:58:53,979 --> 00:58:54,960
Yes, sir.

904
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,451
Just like
Salisbury Plain, sir.

905
00:58:56,526 --> 00:58:57,826
Yes, yes.

906
00:58:57,893 --> 00:59:00,001
There are three of you
together, I understand.

907
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:01,860
I- I-I mean, my s-

908
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:04,415
Uh, Mr. Stone is quartered
with you, isn't he?

909
00:59:04,487 --> 00:59:05,469
Yes, sir.

910
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:06,470
Yes.

911
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,413
Well, I, uh,

912
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:10,657
I- I-I want to talk to you
about something.

913
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:12,155
Uh,

914
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:16,191
Uh, oh,

915
00:59:16,263 --> 00:59:18,565
Uh, oh, t-try some
of my tobacco, McGregor.

916
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:20,501
I- I-It's my own mixture.

917
00:59:20,888 --> 00:59:23,431
You know- you know,
that fellow in Jermyn Street.

918
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:25,642
Lot of perique in it.

919
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,888
Hm.

920
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:28,812
Too strong for me, maybe.

921
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,769
No. No, not for you,
McGregor.

922
00:59:31,028 --> 00:59:32,686
I- I-it might be for Forsythe.

923
00:59:32,756 --> 00:59:34,796
Of the Blues.

924
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:36,111
Late of the Blues, sir.

925
00:59:36,276 --> 00:59:39,124
Huh? Oh, yes, yes,
late of the Blues.

926
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,649
Uh, I-I-I knew
your father, Forsythe.

927
00:59:43,725 --> 00:59:45,123
Oh, did you really?

928
00:59:45,187 --> 00:59:46,163
Yes.

929
00:59:46,236 --> 00:59:47,697
Snake charmer, wasn't he?

930
00:59:47,771 --> 00:59:51,356
What? Brigadier General,
a- a snake charmer?

931
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:52,635
Well, I thought...

932
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:55,672
Well, you see,
his son plays one of those...

933
00:59:55,969 --> 00:59:59,929
Oh, that's odd.
I- I-I never heard of it.

934
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:00,950
Uh...

935
01:00:04,353 --> 01:00:08,140
Oh, oh, probably,
it's just as well.

936
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:09,797
Probably.
Yes, probably, sir.

937
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:12,710
Yes. Yes, I-I-I knew him.

938
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:13,954
Uh...

939
01:00:15,054 --> 01:00:17,704
Y- your father must be
very proud of you, Forsythe.

940
01:00:17,934 --> 01:00:20,487
T- t-the army a-a-and all that
sort of thing, I mean.

941
01:00:20,558 --> 01:00:22,467
Oh, he took all that
for granted, sir.

942
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:24,963
Yes. Yes. Uh...

943
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:28,744
Uh-uh, you-you ought to make
a good officer, Forsythe.

944
01:00:28,814 --> 01:00:30,668
Oh, you've got a lot
to learn yet, of course.

945
01:00:30,733 --> 01:00:32,250
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes.

946
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,704
W- w-where is your father now?

947
01:00:34,773 --> 01:00:36,268
Cheltenham.
Retired.

948
01:00:38,517 --> 01:00:39,636
Retired?

949
01:00:40,571 --> 01:00:41,716
Yeah.

950
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:45,428
Well, we-we come to it.

951
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:47,608
We all come to it.

952
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:53,298
Not much to look
forward to then.

953
01:00:54,043 --> 01:00:56,451
Not much, unless, uh...

954
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:07,582
Well, uh, we've had
a hard day.

955
01:01:07,784 --> 01:01:10,118
Now, you-you'd better
get yourself some sleep.

956
01:01:11,816 --> 01:01:13,343
Good night, gentlemen.

957
01:01:15,688 --> 01:01:17,249
Good night, sir.

958
01:01:17,544 --> 01:01:18,688
Good night, sir.

959
01:01:28,399 --> 01:01:29,780
Good night, sir.

960
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:31,955
Yeah, good night, Hamilton.

961
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:39,022
That fellow in Jermyn Street.

962
01:01:39,413 --> 01:01:40,842
Pour lumps of sugar.

963
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:45,465
Not much to
look forward to.

964
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:47,480
So he wanted
to talk to us.

965
01:01:47,548 --> 01:01:49,752
Well,
whatever it was,

966
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,925
he couldn't get it
off his chest, could he?

967
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,005
Say, do you suppose...

968
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,253
Ah, is the light
beginning to break?

969
01:01:56,322 --> 01:01:57,467
I got it.

970
01:01:58,434 --> 01:02:00,409
The old man doesn't know
what to do about his kid,

971
01:02:00,482 --> 01:02:01,889
and wants us
to help him,

972
01:02:02,274 --> 01:02:03,834
but just
couldn't get it out.

973
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:05,281
That's brilliant, Mac.

974
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,814
That's positively brilliant.

975
01:02:06,879 --> 01:02:07,855
That's it, all right.

976
01:02:07,928 --> 01:02:09,348
I never thought
he cared that much.

977
01:02:09,423 --> 01:02:10,977
I never thought
he was that human.

978
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:13,191
Yet the way
he went after that pig

979
01:02:13,257 --> 01:02:15,112
when he thought
his boy was in for it.

980
01:02:15,305 --> 01:02:17,127
Yeah, game old cock.

981
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:21,158
Those tusks got him a lot
worse than he lets on, too.

982
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,319
Boy's pretty
bitter and ugly.

983
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,629
Largely the old
man's fault, of course.

984
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:30,378
Partly the old man's,
partly our system's.

985
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:32,290
But mostly the boy's.

986
01:02:32,354 --> 01:02:33,688
Let's wake him up.

987
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:37,043
Well, no, Mac. I leave that
to you. He's your ward.

988
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:41,136
Well, the old man talked
to you, too, didn't he?

989
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:55,536
That girI.

990
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:00,987
Ah, youth, youth!

991
01:03:16,777 --> 01:03:18,466
I trust you won't find
the journey

992
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:19,955
too uncomfortable,
Mr. Stone.

993
01:04:11,017 --> 01:04:12,643
Halt! Who goes there?

994
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:18,311
Guard, turn out.

995
01:04:28,944 --> 01:04:30,221
Barrett sahib.

996
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:45,135
As he turned around, we fired
and brought him down, sir.

997
01:04:46,614 --> 01:04:48,043
Thank you, McGregor.

998
01:04:49,276 --> 01:04:50,902
Your version, Forsythe?

999
01:04:51,101 --> 01:04:52,890
Mr. Stone
was not in his tent.

1000
01:04:53,021 --> 01:04:54,839
That's all we can say, sir.

1001
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:56,743
You've both tried
to shield him.

1002
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:58,527
All the facts are obvious.

1003
01:04:58,596 --> 01:04:59,905
He couldn't
have been seized

1004
01:04:59,972 --> 01:05:02,077
in the middle of the camp
without some outcry.

1005
01:05:02,756 --> 01:05:04,993
Just slipped out
against orders.

1006
01:05:05,476 --> 01:05:08,476
Anyway, he can tell
where they've taken him, sir.

1007
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,056
Hamzulla, ask him where Mohammed Khan
has taken my son.

1008
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:26,096
I think I can
make him talk, sir.

1009
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:27,727
Well, try.

1010
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,343
Guards doubled
as ordered, sir.

1011
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:39,949
Thank you, Norton.

1012
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:46,010
Barrett?

1013
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:49,302
Bad?

1014
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:51,805
The eyes, and the usuaI...

1015
01:06:28,427 --> 01:06:29,545
Mogala.

1016
01:06:30,764 --> 01:06:32,217
Thank you,
McGregor.

1017
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,290
I learned that
one from you, sir.

1018
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:36,140
Hamzulla Khan,
take him away

1019
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:37,557
and see that he
is well guarded.

1020
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:50,254
Trial of that Afridi,
10:00 a. m. Tomorrow.

1021
01:06:50,936 --> 01:06:53,107
Services for Barrett,
at noon.

1022
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:56,485
That's all, gentlemen.

1023
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,512
But, sir.
I thought that-

1024
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:02,555
You thought what,
Mr. McGregor?

1025
01:07:02,628 --> 01:07:05,017
That you were going
after your son, sir.

1026
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,570
This incident will not change
our plans in any respect.

1027
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:13,885
But-But knowing where
he's taking your son

1028
01:07:13,957 --> 01:07:15,167
makes all
the difference, sir.

1029
01:07:15,237 --> 01:07:17,277
We can be at Mogala
almost as soon as he is.

1030
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:19,035
This regiment
can ride, sir.

1031
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:22,468
I'm aware
my regiment can ride.

1032
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:24,995
I'm also aware that
I am not going to do

1033
01:07:25,066 --> 01:07:28,229
precisely what Mohammed Khan
has planned that I should do.

1034
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:30,567
He took my son
to goad me into pursuing him

1035
01:07:30,634 --> 01:07:32,805
to draw the lancers
from their position.

1036
01:07:32,874 --> 01:07:34,248
He's mistaken his man.

1037
01:07:34,314 --> 01:07:36,004
But this-
In our present position,

1038
01:07:36,073 --> 01:07:38,375
the regiment holds
Mohammed Khan checkmate.

1039
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:39,783
The regiment stays here.

1040
01:07:39,849 --> 01:07:40,864
Then let me go.

1041
01:07:40,937 --> 01:07:41,880
I can take
a small detachment-

1042
01:07:41,955 --> 01:07:43,773
Mr. McGregor, I cannot
weaken the strength

1043
01:07:43,837 --> 01:07:45,586
of the regiment
in this emergency.

1044
01:07:45,654 --> 01:07:47,542
And I can't permit you
or any other officer

1045
01:07:47,607 --> 01:07:49,429
to risk their lives
for Mr. Stone.

1046
01:07:49,494 --> 01:07:51,599
But he's your son, and
we can save him, can't we?

1047
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,231
That will be all,
Mr. McGregor.

1048
01:07:57,943 --> 01:07:59,404
Then take a look at that.

1049
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:01,584
That's what Mohammed Khan
does to his prisoners.

1050
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,570
That's quite unnecessary,
Mr. McGregor.

1051
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:11,801
I know what may
happen to my son

1052
01:08:11,876 --> 01:08:13,916
through his own
disobedience and folly.

1053
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:17,371
I'd just begun to think
I was wrong about you,

1054
01:08:17,444 --> 01:08:18,426
but I wasn't.

1055
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,387
You haven't a human bone
in your body.

1056
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:22,274
There's not a drop
of blood in your veins.

1057
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,485
You're nothing but a-

1058
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:24,668
McGregor.

1059
01:08:24,835 --> 01:08:26,461
So you'll sit here
with your regiment

1060
01:08:26,532 --> 01:08:28,092
while they kill
your son by inches.

1061
01:08:28,163 --> 01:08:29,143
Well, I won't!

1062
01:08:29,217 --> 01:08:31,245
I'm going after him whether
you like it or not.

1063
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:32,555
Mr. McGregor!

1064
01:08:32,622 --> 01:08:35,112
Pending charges
of insubordination

1065
01:08:35,217 --> 01:08:37,551
you will please consider
yourself under arrest.

1066
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:40,431
Mr. Forsythe, you will be
responsible for the prisoner.

1067
01:08:43,216 --> 01:08:44,645
You fooI.
Can't you see-

1068
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,930
So you-
Mac!

1069
01:08:47,217 --> 01:08:48,394
Come along.

1070
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,846
Well, I must say
you spoke your mind,

1071
01:08:54,915 --> 01:08:57,008
old colonial, if
there's any virtue in that.

1072
01:08:57,657 --> 01:08:59,516
"Regiment, duty,
you're improperly dressed. "

1073
01:08:59,582 --> 01:09:00,989
That's all
he cares about.

1074
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,166
So they'll say,

1075
01:09:02,237 --> 01:09:04,277
"Very good, CoI. Stone,"
and pin another medal on him.

1076
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:05,779
Or else he's...

1077
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:07,479
Haven't you said enough,
McGregor?

1078
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:09,240
The coloneI's right
and you know it.

1079
01:09:09,309 --> 01:09:11,197
You're only making it
harder for him.

1080
01:09:11,325 --> 01:09:13,813
If you take my advice,
you'll go over and apologize.

1081
01:09:13,886 --> 01:09:16,090
Not me. Apologize
after what he did?

1082
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:18,287
Oh, for heaven's sake, man,
get some sense.

1083
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:21,123
Do you suppose it was
an easy thing for him to do?

1084
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:22,269
His own son?

1085
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:23,394
Why wasn't it?

1086
01:09:23,658 --> 01:09:25,033
He doesn't care
about him.

1087
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:26,593
He'd do the same thing
to any of us.

1088
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:29,252
But to sit here and let them
pull his own son to pieces

1089
01:09:29,323 --> 01:09:30,849
because of a few
cases of ammunition-

1090
01:09:30,922 --> 01:09:32,580
Are you blind, man?

1091
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:34,337
You think he doesn't care?

1092
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:35,946
Well, I know he does.

1093
01:09:36,459 --> 01:09:38,019
Well, I suppose
if it were your son,

1094
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,519
you'd sit here, too,
like a dummy.

1095
01:09:39,595 --> 01:09:40,577
You would not-

1096
01:09:40,651 --> 01:09:42,842
No, I should probably
have ordered the regiment out.

1097
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,872
That's because I'm not
the man the colonel is.

1098
01:09:44,945 --> 01:09:45,927
Nor the soldier.

1099
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:47,693
Well, if that's what
you call being a man

1100
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:49,839
or a soldier, I don't
want any part of it.

1101
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:51,024
Not me.

1102
01:09:51,096 --> 01:09:52,819
That kid needs him.
It's his own blood,

1103
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:54,381
and if he cared
a hang about him-

1104
01:09:54,455 --> 01:09:56,910
Of course he cares. But
what's that got to do with it?

1105
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,447
He loved his wife, too,
but he lost her.

1106
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:00,493
She was American.

1107
01:10:00,567 --> 01:10:02,640
Couldn't stick the service,
couldn't understand.

1108
01:10:02,712 --> 01:10:05,521
So he chose the regiment then
just as he's doing now.

1109
01:10:05,586 --> 01:10:07,712
But that doesn't mean
he didn't care.

1110
01:10:08,035 --> 01:10:08,979
I know.

1111
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:11,289
I ought to know.
We were Cubs together.

1112
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,760
He put his whole souI
into the regiment,

1113
01:10:13,828 --> 01:10:15,170
and that's all he's had.

1114
01:10:15,685 --> 01:10:18,205
And he won't have that long,
either. Retirement.

1115
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:20,388
He'll have an armchair
in the club,

1116
01:10:20,452 --> 01:10:22,459
and a window over the rag,
and that's all.

1117
01:10:22,532 --> 01:10:23,580
And he'll have nothing

1118
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:25,758
if his boy doesn't carry on
in this regiment.

1119
01:10:26,212 --> 01:10:27,292
Then he'd have everything?

1120
01:10:27,364 --> 01:10:29,746
Of course he would.
That's what it means to him.

1121
01:10:29,822 --> 01:10:31,188
But you think
he'd let that make

1122
01:10:31,252 --> 01:10:32,999
any difference
to his orders, to his job?

1123
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:34,594
Well, why shouldn't it?

1124
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,489
Why can't he be
a little less of a soldier

1125
01:10:36,555 --> 01:10:37,604
and more of a man?

1126
01:10:37,677 --> 01:10:39,885
Why can't he forget
his blasted duty for once?

1127
01:10:39,954 --> 01:10:41,415
Man, you are blind!

1128
01:10:41,522 --> 01:10:42,798
Have you never thought

1129
01:10:42,865 --> 01:10:44,753
how for generation
after generation here,

1130
01:10:44,818 --> 01:10:46,476
a handfuI of men
have ordered the lives

1131
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:48,454
of 300 million people?

1132
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:50,927
It's because he's here,
and a few more like him.

1133
01:10:51,186 --> 01:10:53,514
Men of his breed
have made British India.

1134
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,583
Men who put their jobs
above everything.

1135
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:57,615
He wouldn't let death
move him from it

1136
01:10:57,688 --> 01:10:59,695
and he won't let love
move him from it.

1137
01:11:00,953 --> 01:11:04,025
When his breed of man
dies out, that's the end.

1138
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,070
And it's
a better breed of man

1139
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:08,891
than any of us will ever make.

1140
01:11:09,247 --> 01:11:10,588
Good night, gentlemen.

1141
01:11:13,054 --> 01:11:15,356
There's a great deaI
of speaking of minds

1142
01:11:15,423 --> 01:11:16,763
going on here tonight.

1143
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:19,879
I didn't think
the old boy had it in him,

1144
01:11:20,138 --> 01:11:21,660
but he's right.

1145
01:11:22,822 --> 01:11:25,189
According to his way
of thinking, maybe.

1146
01:11:26,213 --> 01:11:27,873
It's funny,
your being out here

1147
01:11:27,944 --> 01:11:29,703
and thinking of it
in any other way.

1148
01:11:29,771 --> 01:11:31,429
On their side, huh?

1149
01:11:31,883 --> 01:11:34,305
Well, I'm not. So I'm
going to do something.

1150
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,606
There's been enough thinking
and talking, too. I'm going.

1151
01:11:40,011 --> 01:11:41,759
Are you really, now?

1152
01:11:42,273 --> 01:11:45,325
You know, you put me
in a rather awkward position.

1153
01:11:45,394 --> 01:11:47,728
Look, I don't want
any trouble with you,

1154
01:11:47,794 --> 01:11:48,809
but I'm going.

1155
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,825
Well, when do we start?

1156
01:11:53,335 --> 01:11:55,158
What do you mean "we"?

1157
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,073
You're my prisoner, you know.

1158
01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:58,965
I couldn't let you
out of my sight.

1159
01:12:13,856 --> 01:12:15,710
I regret to have
to report, sir.

1160
01:12:15,776 --> 01:12:18,015
McGregor and Forsythe
have disappeared.

1161
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:19,360
What, desertion?

1162
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:21,666
I suppose it is,
technically.

1163
01:12:28,484 --> 01:12:30,708
Well, what did you expect?

1164
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:56,057
" Sure I love
the dear silver "

1165
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:58,260
" That shines in her hair "

1166
01:12:58,329 --> 01:13:00,435
" And the brow
that's all furrowed "

1167
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,415
" and wrinkled with care "

1168
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:07,087
" I kiss the dear fingers
so toiI-worn for me "

1169
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:11,132
" Oh, God bless you
and keep you "

1170
01:13:11,584 --> 01:13:12,664
" Mother "

1171
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,553
" Mcgregor "

1172
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:48,306
Why do they want to talk
so many languages in India?

1173
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:49,901
It's up to you.

1174
01:13:49,971 --> 01:13:51,564
You'll have to be
the talking merchant.

1175
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:53,418
I'll be
the deaf and dumb one.

1176
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:19,934
Well,
at least we're in.

1177
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,593
I hope getting out
is as easy.

1178
01:14:27,558 --> 01:14:28,896
Trying to be funny?

1179
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:30,383
No, I'm not
trying to be funny.

1180
01:14:30,457 --> 01:14:31,857
I'm scared stiff.

1181
01:14:32,112 --> 01:14:33,669
What are we
going to do now?

1182
01:14:33,741 --> 01:14:35,148
Try to look and act
like the rest

1183
01:14:35,213 --> 01:14:36,740
of these merchants.
Set up shops.

1184
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:38,984
Sell a few doodads
while we take a look around.

1185
01:14:44,909 --> 01:14:47,331
I don't see anything
that looks like a plan.

1186
01:14:47,406 --> 01:14:48,425
As far as I can see,

1187
01:14:48,499 --> 01:14:50,604
we've just stuck our head
in the lion's mouth.

1188
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:53,569
A very large and
unpleasant lion, too.

1189
01:14:54,152 --> 01:14:55,997
Suppose you
were Mohammed Khan,

1190
01:14:56,062 --> 01:14:57,335
where would you have put him?

1191
01:14:57,402 --> 01:14:59,736
Oh, no, you play first.
It'll be more fun.

1192
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:01,458
All right.

1193
01:15:01,658 --> 01:15:03,480
You stay here
and unpack these things

1194
01:15:03,546 --> 01:15:04,757
and set up shop.

1195
01:15:04,826 --> 01:15:06,168
I'll take a look around.

1196
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:08,535
Don't forget
you're deaf and dumb.

1197
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,023
You'd better cut
your prices, Mac,

1198
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:51,523
before I get my throat cut.

1199
01:16:51,949 --> 01:16:53,354
Do you think
she recognized us?

1200
01:16:53,419 --> 01:16:54,755
I hope not.

1201
01:16:55,075 --> 01:16:56,628
I don't think so.

1202
01:16:56,859 --> 01:16:58,419
Anyway,
we won't worry about it.

1203
01:16:58,491 --> 01:17:00,018
Did you see
anything interesting?

1204
01:17:00,091 --> 01:17:01,433
Not a thing.

1205
01:17:22,442 --> 01:17:23,904
What's that mean?
Time to go?

1206
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:25,123
Yes.

1207
01:17:25,194 --> 01:17:27,496
But we're gonna stay
right here untiI we can-

1208
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:37,668
He's in all right.
No doubt about that.

1209
01:17:37,738 --> 01:17:39,493
And doing rather well, too.

1210
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:42,199
Clicquot.
I saw the labeI. Iced.

1211
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,975
If that's the way Mohammed Khan
tortures his victims

1212
01:17:45,047 --> 01:17:47,414
I'd like to change places
with him for 10 minutes.

1213
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:49,138
That guard's got
a key all right.

1214
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:51,628
If we can last till night,
hit the guard over the head

1215
01:17:51,703 --> 01:17:53,590
get the kid out,
try and steal some horses-

1216
01:17:53,655 --> 01:17:54,865
Jump them over
a 40-foot wall

1217
01:17:54,935 --> 01:17:56,691
and then that mad dash
for the border.

1218
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,890
Well, you think
of something better.

1219
01:18:12,996 --> 01:18:14,457
Mohammed Khan sent for us.

1220
01:18:14,532 --> 01:18:15,939
He wants to see
our rugs and laces.

1221
01:18:16,004 --> 01:18:17,793
Do you suppose?
No, I don't suppose.

1222
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,900
Don't forget
you're deaf and dumb.

1223
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:39,178
Oh, come, come, gentlemen.

1224
01:18:39,249 --> 01:18:41,071
It isn't everyday
that two British officers

1225
01:18:41,137 --> 01:18:44,072
prostrate themselves at the feet of
a poor border chieftain.

1226
01:18:44,145 --> 01:18:46,534
Mr. McGregor, Mr. Forsythe.

1227
01:18:47,601 --> 01:18:50,797
I told you, this Mardi Gras
would be a washout.

1228
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,057
I had hoped the ColoneI
might come himself

1229
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:55,005
but since he has so
very cleverly refused,

1230
01:18:55,132 --> 01:18:57,015
I welcome you
to my humble home.

1231
01:18:57,305 --> 01:18:58,968
You remember,
my dear, of course?

1232
01:18:59,038 --> 01:19:00,118
How could I forget?

1233
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:01,913
They were such
charming dinner companions.

1234
01:19:01,982 --> 01:19:03,673
Dinner. Yes, of course.

1235
01:19:03,742 --> 01:19:05,433
You will dine with me
surely, gentlemen,

1236
01:19:05,502 --> 01:19:07,225
to try my poor savage fare?

1237
01:19:07,294 --> 01:19:10,458
I know you must be anxious
to meet my guest of honor.

1238
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:14,264
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Mr. McGregor.

1239
01:19:26,347 --> 01:19:28,965
Yes, I've-I've seen
good cricket in my time.

1240
01:19:29,035 --> 01:19:30,595
I was an Oxford man,
you know.

1241
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:32,423
But I must compliment you,
Mr. Forsythe,

1242
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:33,636
on your delivery.

1243
01:19:33,707 --> 01:19:34,635
Superb.

1244
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:35,877
Oh, charming
compliment.

1245
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,530
My only regret is that
it wasn't a hand grenade.

1246
01:19:38,603 --> 01:19:39,810
A charming thought.

1247
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:41,019
A charming dinner.

1248
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:43,347
The mutton
was, uh, excellent.

1249
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:44,839
Always mutton.

1250
01:19:45,074 --> 01:19:47,597
We have mutton or chicken
up here. But, as you say,

1251
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:50,672
good mutton, quite the equaI
of your English South Down.

1252
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:53,111
Now you put me in a very
difficult position.

1253
01:19:53,176 --> 01:19:55,696
Pride of country urges me
to argue the point.

1254
01:19:55,864 --> 01:19:57,839
But my position
as, uh...

1255
01:19:57,912 --> 01:19:59,319
as a guest,
shall we say-

1256
01:19:59,384 --> 01:20:02,286
By all means a guest,
for the time being.

1257
01:20:02,456 --> 01:20:04,109
For the time being, huh?

1258
01:20:04,656 --> 01:20:06,274
Pass the wine.

1259
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:07,798
My position
as a guest

1260
01:20:07,872 --> 01:20:09,115
for the time being,
of course,

1261
01:20:09,183 --> 01:20:10,939
inclines me
to agree with you.

1262
01:20:11,455 --> 01:20:12,801
Well, a compliment indeed,

1263
01:20:12,867 --> 01:20:15,357
that we can approach the excellence
of anything British.

1264
01:20:16,005 --> 01:20:18,242
I'm fed up with this
cat-and-mouse business.

1265
01:20:18,309 --> 01:20:19,356
Let's talk sense.

1266
01:20:19,429 --> 01:20:21,982
You've got us here and now what
are you going to do with us?

1267
01:20:22,053 --> 01:20:23,482
Mac, manners,
manners.

1268
01:20:23,781 --> 01:20:26,050
By the way, we didn't
thank the Khan sahib

1269
01:20:26,117 --> 01:20:28,412
for our charming
and picturesque raiment.

1270
01:20:28,637 --> 01:20:30,732
Suppose we stay
with the subject?

1271
01:20:30,834 --> 01:20:32,289
I'm quite prepared
to supply you

1272
01:20:32,364 --> 01:20:34,153
with horses to return
to your regiment.

1273
01:20:34,572 --> 01:20:36,677
You can tell your coloneI
that some of my men

1274
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:38,893
misunderstood his son's
innocent flirtation.

1275
01:20:38,962 --> 01:20:40,423
Of course,
when I found it out,

1276
01:20:40,498 --> 01:20:41,807
I punished them at once.

1277
01:20:41,873 --> 01:20:44,426
An easy explanation of how
I came to set you free.

1278
01:20:44,497 --> 01:20:45,839
And, uh,
what's the catch?

1279
01:20:45,906 --> 01:20:48,972
You have only to answer
two very simple questions:

1280
01:20:49,842 --> 01:20:52,704
By what route is
the ammunition train coming

1281
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:55,165
and just where does
the regiment plan

1282
01:20:55,229 --> 01:20:56,632
to meet it for convoy?

1283
01:20:57,977 --> 01:20:59,864
Well, when the furry
little animaI

1284
01:20:59,929 --> 01:21:02,649
jumped out of the bag
he really jumped, didn't he?

1285
01:21:04,351 --> 01:21:05,780
Well, gentlemen.

1286
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:10,043
We have ways
to make men talk.

1287
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:14,266
If you'll forgive me,
I- I have a headache.

1288
01:21:14,335 --> 01:21:16,184
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.

1289
01:21:18,892 --> 01:21:20,795
Madame Volkanskaya
finds our methods

1290
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:22,332
in this part of the world

1291
01:21:22,405 --> 01:21:24,260
a little too direct
for her taste.

1292
01:21:24,325 --> 01:21:26,114
Your brandy, gentlemen.

1293
01:21:33,196 --> 01:21:35,585
Take it. We may need it.

1294
01:21:42,937 --> 01:21:44,175
I regret this,

1295
01:21:44,243 --> 01:21:46,731
but thanks to your coloneI's
cold heart and cold brain

1296
01:21:46,803 --> 01:21:48,843
I have no other choice,
and very little time.

1297
01:21:48,914 --> 01:21:50,605
Now that we're
no longer guests,

1298
01:21:50,674 --> 01:21:52,586
tell him what you
really think of the mutton.

1299
01:21:52,662 --> 01:21:53,777
Oh, yes.

1300
01:21:55,673 --> 01:21:57,812
As much as I regret
to say this,

1301
01:21:57,881 --> 01:21:59,669
your mutton
is undoubtedly-

1302
01:21:59,736 --> 01:22:01,046
"Rotten" is the word.

1303
01:22:01,113 --> 01:22:02,225
Thanks, Mac.

1304
01:22:29,848 --> 01:22:32,139
Come, now, gentlemen,
must I proceed

1305
01:22:32,205 --> 01:22:34,725
to these absurd
and unpleasant extremes?

1306
01:22:37,421 --> 01:22:39,243
Little bamboo slivers

1307
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:42,025
but when they're driven
under the fingernails

1308
01:22:42,478 --> 01:22:43,726
and lighted,

1309
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,283
we find them
very effective.

1310
01:22:46,386 --> 01:22:48,558
Bring the other two gentlemen
a little bit closer

1311
01:22:48,627 --> 01:22:50,088
so they can see well.

1312
01:22:57,017 --> 01:23:00,246
I shall proceed first
with Mr. McGregor.

1313
01:24:45,646 --> 01:24:47,502
I'll get you some water.

1314
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:49,392
I'd rather have
a cigarette, Mac.

1315
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:29,692
Dentist once in MontreaI
hit a nerve.

1316
01:25:30,216 --> 01:25:32,004
It hurt almost as bad.

1317
01:25:32,904 --> 01:25:35,271
Well, he's been
to a dentist.

1318
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:52,595
Let me alone!

1319
01:26:10,241 --> 01:26:11,932
Come on, Tania.
Don't faiI me, Tania.

1320
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:13,659
Come along,
Mohammed Khan.

1321
01:26:14,242 --> 01:26:15,190
Show some speed!

1322
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:16,442
Tania!

1323
01:26:16,514 --> 01:26:18,270
For dear
old Forsythe.

1324
01:26:18,338 --> 01:26:20,509
Tania! Tania!
Run, jump, do something!

1325
01:26:20,578 --> 01:26:21,658
Do anything.

1326
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:23,006
That's right.
Here we go.

1327
01:26:23,073 --> 01:26:24,382
Tania!
One jump.

1328
01:26:24,481 --> 01:26:26,749
Come on, Mohammed Khan,
take that hurdle.

1329
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:29,177
Ah, Mohammed Khan,
by half a length.

1330
01:26:29,402 --> 01:26:32,806
That makes 40 million
Rupees you owe me.

1331
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:35,525
Another day of this,
and I'm broke.

1332
01:26:35,599 --> 01:26:37,737
Another day of this, we'll
be going around in circles

1333
01:26:37,806 --> 01:26:39,181
like
those cockroaches.

1334
01:26:39,822 --> 01:26:41,961
Ah, I wonder when these
whiskers stop itching

1335
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:43,405
and begin to be a beard!

1336
01:26:43,822 --> 01:26:45,732
Foulest torture
ever invented.

1337
01:26:45,838 --> 01:26:47,594
Keep us in a cell
that crawls

1338
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:49,604
and fix us so
we can't scratch.

1339
01:27:11,755 --> 01:27:14,535
All the Khan's horses
and all the Khan's men.

1340
01:27:19,929 --> 01:27:21,554
It didn't
take him long.

1341
01:27:21,913 --> 01:27:23,320
I'd like to
have seen the look

1342
01:27:23,384 --> 01:27:24,628
on the ColoneI's face.

1343
01:27:42,471 --> 01:27:44,891
It looks as if they were
expecting trouble.

1344
01:27:56,965 --> 01:27:58,459
There's only one answer.

1345
01:27:58,597 --> 01:28:00,124
The ColoneI's
after them.

1346
01:28:00,421 --> 01:28:01,948
And with all
the ammunition here,

1347
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,899
there's nothing to
keep him in GopaI.

1348
01:28:03,965 --> 01:28:05,299
With those machine guns

1349
01:28:05,366 --> 01:28:06,822
and two million rounds
of ammunition

1350
01:28:06,895 --> 01:28:08,425
the regiment
wouldn't have a chance.

1351
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:10,157
The old Ramrod's a fooI
to try it.

1352
01:28:10,227 --> 01:28:11,471
He will, though.

1353
01:28:11,539 --> 01:28:13,262
There's nothing much
we can do about it.

1354
01:28:19,219 --> 01:28:21,390
I wish I had
my toodle-oodle here.

1355
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:23,790
I'd play you some
wild Scotch airs.

1356
01:28:23,859 --> 01:28:25,768
Over my dead body,
you would.

1357
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:27,330
You know, that's
rather clever, Mac.

1358
01:28:27,403 --> 01:28:29,781
Why don't you say it?
Why don't you say what you're thinking?

1359
01:28:29,857 --> 01:28:30,801
Forget it!

1360
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:33,115
I'm to blame. I told them,
that's what you're thinking.

1361
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,361
Why don't you say it?
Shut up!

1362
01:28:34,431 --> 01:28:37,213
All right, I told them
and why shouldn't I? For him?

1363
01:28:37,536 --> 01:28:38,877
To stand there and watch

1364
01:28:38,943 --> 01:28:41,278
and know all the time
I was gonna be next

1365
01:28:41,343 --> 01:28:44,212
to have your nails torn off
and those pincers

1366
01:28:44,287 --> 01:28:46,229
and burning sticks
driven into you untiI...

1367
01:28:46,303 --> 01:28:48,125
And things you
can't even talk about.

1368
01:28:54,856 --> 01:28:56,512
Why should I stand all that?

1369
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:58,498
For what? For him?

1370
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:02,244
For a service that makes him
like he's been to me?

1371
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:05,574
He left me here, didn't he?

1372
01:29:05,644 --> 01:29:06,953
He knew what they'd do.

1373
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:08,908
He wouldn't come
after me, not him.

1374
01:29:08,972 --> 01:29:10,947
Regiment, service, duty!

1375
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,187
Why should I stand
what you did for them?

1376
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,946
Why should I?
Why should any of us? Why?

1377
01:29:18,232 --> 01:29:19,950
I told you to forget it.

1378
01:29:20,403 --> 01:29:21,931
All right, Mac.

1379
01:29:22,037 --> 01:29:23,863
But I still
don't understand why.

1380
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:25,937
Why? Well...

1381
01:29:26,169 --> 01:29:28,558
Well, there are some things
they don't teach you

1382
01:29:28,634 --> 01:29:30,543
in military college.
Can't, I guess.

1383
01:29:30,745 --> 01:29:34,128
India's big, you know.
There are 300 million people

1384
01:29:34,265 --> 01:29:36,469
and run by, uh,
just a handfuI of men.

1385
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,769
The-The-The job comes first.

1386
01:29:39,346 --> 01:29:40,388
Like old Ramrod,

1387
01:29:40,461 --> 01:29:42,524
you can't let death
move you, nor love.

1388
01:29:42,595 --> 01:29:43,640
And it's like...

1389
01:29:43,713 --> 01:29:45,273
How can I tell you
what it's all about

1390
01:29:45,344 --> 01:29:46,806
when I don't know
myself?

1391
01:29:56,422 --> 01:29:58,811
"'The time has
come,'the Walrus said,

1392
01:29:58,887 --> 01:30:00,294
"'To speak of many things

1393
01:30:00,358 --> 01:30:02,395
"'Of ships and shoes
and sealing-wax,

1394
01:30:02,467 --> 01:30:03,835
Of cabbages and kings. "'

1395
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,268
Oh, shut up!

1396
01:30:05,907 --> 01:30:07,657
You don't like
poetry?

1397
01:30:07,885 --> 01:30:09,740
How should I know?
I never read any.

1398
01:30:11,117 --> 01:30:13,262
Perhaps something
more rugged.

1399
01:30:14,995 --> 01:30:17,450
"Ever the faith endures,

1400
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,502
"England, my England

1401
01:30:20,723 --> 01:30:23,276
"Take and break us,
we are yours

1402
01:30:23,347 --> 01:30:25,005
"England, my own

1403
01:30:26,893 --> 01:30:30,196

01:30:36,442 --> 01:30:39,677
"to the Song

1407
01:30:40,672 --> 01:30:43,193
To the stars on
your bugles blown!"

1408
01:30:45,184 --> 01:30:47,039
If I had known I was
going to say all this,

1409
01:30:47,104 --> 01:30:48,533
I would have
brought my violin.

1410
01:31:21,012 --> 01:31:23,662
You weren't by any chance thinking
how nice it would be

1411
01:31:23,732 --> 01:31:26,602
if someone spilled the fire
into that ammunition, were you?

1412
01:31:29,178 --> 01:31:31,251
About 200 yards,
I'd say.

1413
01:31:31,418 --> 01:31:32,793
Nearer a 100.

1414
01:31:33,082 --> 01:31:35,384
My last year in Oxford
I won the 220.

1415
01:31:35,738 --> 01:31:37,842
I ran the 100
in 10 flat at McGill.

1416
01:31:38,103 --> 01:31:41,090
It's nearer 200.
And where's McGill?

1417
01:31:42,182 --> 01:31:43,639
Mcgill's in MontreaI.

1418
01:31:43,713 --> 01:31:45,404
And this is a job
for a 100-yard man.

1419
01:31:45,889 --> 01:31:47,580
Forget I'm your
superior officer?

1420
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:49,438
Forget you're
my prisoner?

1421
01:31:50,785 --> 01:31:51,931
Toss you?

1422
01:31:59,175 --> 01:32:00,801
The cockroaches.

1423
01:32:00,871 --> 01:32:02,872
If Tania gets to
the wall first, I win.

1424
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,332
It's a go?
Mohammed Khan! Come on!

1425
01:32:05,398 --> 01:32:06,918
Tania, what's the matter?

1426
01:32:06,991 --> 01:32:09,707
Mohammed Khan again!
It's my job.

1427
01:32:10,862 --> 01:32:13,066
Your luck's as good
as ever, Mac.

1428
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:15,277
And now all I have to do

1429
01:32:15,342 --> 01:32:17,067
is figure a way
to get out of here.

1430
01:32:17,136 --> 01:32:18,220
That's all.

1431
01:32:26,543 --> 01:32:27,782
Too late, sir.

1432
01:32:27,849 --> 01:32:29,305
Hopeless to
attack that strength.

1433
01:32:29,379 --> 01:32:31,378
If we retire now
and that ammunition

1434
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:33,393
is distributed
amongst the tribes...

1435
01:32:33,467 --> 01:32:34,743
You know what that means.

1436
01:32:34,811 --> 01:32:36,153
Yes, a costly job,
sir.

1437
01:32:36,219 --> 01:32:37,299
I know.

1438
01:32:37,435 --> 01:32:39,323
But it's worth
the whole regiment.

1439
01:32:39,579 --> 01:32:41,881
Squadron, wheel into line.
Gallop!

1440
01:32:49,217 --> 01:32:50,869
What are you doing?

1441
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,197
I'm trying to wear
a hole in the wall

1442
01:32:53,264 --> 01:32:54,719
so we can all
climb through.

1443
01:33:00,808 --> 01:33:02,052
It occurred to me,
gentlemen

1444
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,422
that you might like to know
what is to become of you.

1445
01:33:04,488 --> 01:33:07,009
I'm expecting a visit from
your colonel in a few minutes.

1446
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,475
I can assure you he will
receive a very warm reception.

1447
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,787
In the coming engagement,
if the Colonel escapes

1448
01:33:11,854 --> 01:33:13,739
I shall send you all
back to him alive.

1449
01:33:13,804 --> 01:33:16,096
If he is captured,
you will all die.

1450
01:33:16,512 --> 01:33:18,359
In any case,
I shall have the pleasure

1451
01:33:18,424 --> 01:33:20,461
of bringing the ColoneI
face to face with a son

1452
01:33:20,533 --> 01:33:22,256
who betrayed his Empire.

1453
01:33:35,899 --> 01:33:37,556
Very foolish,
Mr. Forsythe.

1454
01:33:37,626 --> 01:33:40,298
You should always temper
courage with judgment.

1455
01:33:51,842 --> 01:33:53,402
That's a fooI thing
to do.

1456
01:33:53,474 --> 01:33:54,849
We'll get it
soon enough.

1457
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:04,755
Did you get a gun, too?

1458
01:34:05,175 --> 01:34:07,556
Just about enough powder
in those, I think,

1459
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:09,668
to blow that lock off.

1460
01:34:10,095 --> 01:34:12,037
It took us five days
to think of that.

1461
01:34:12,111 --> 01:34:13,257
Us?

1462
01:34:15,343 --> 01:34:17,383
Take a little water and mix
enough straw and mud

1463
01:34:17,455 --> 01:34:18,917
to seal this lock.

1464
01:34:25,141 --> 01:34:26,890
What do we use
for a fuse?

1465
01:34:39,612 --> 01:34:40,725
Mac.

1466
01:34:40,796 --> 01:34:41,810
Yeah.

1467
01:34:41,884 --> 01:34:43,859
This idea, I'm in on it.

1468
01:34:43,932 --> 01:34:45,492
It was my fault, all this,

1469
01:34:45,564 --> 01:34:47,258
and if there's any way...
I mean-

1470
01:34:47,327 --> 01:34:49,336
Sure, I know.
Ready with that wick?

1471
01:34:49,632 --> 01:34:51,447
I mean, there's not
much left that...

1472
01:34:51,512 --> 01:34:53,163
Well, I couldn't go back,
like he said,

1473
01:34:53,233 --> 01:34:54,981
not to the regiment
or to England.

1474
01:34:56,425 --> 01:34:58,149
If anybody's going
to take any chances,

1475
01:34:58,217 --> 01:34:59,329
I'll take them.

1476
01:34:59,401 --> 01:35:00,611
Sure you're in on it.

1477
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,306
Never thought of it
any other way.

1478
01:35:02,377 --> 01:35:04,003
Just stick close and
do what you're told

1479
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:05,316
till we get this open.

1480
01:35:21,494 --> 01:35:23,599
There's someone on that tower
with a machine gun.

1481
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:25,874
Let me get it and cover you
while you make a run for it.

1482
01:35:25,942 --> 01:35:26,890
All right.

1483
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:29,931
Look, I've got a hunch

1484
01:35:30,006 --> 01:35:31,348
we're going to
get out of this.

1485
01:35:31,414 --> 01:35:33,934
We can't let the old man or
anybody know what's happened.

1486
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:56,704
Mohammed Khan!
Mohammed Khan!

1487
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:11,457
This way.

1488
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:27,089
All right, Mac,
you keep me covered.

1489
01:37:27,159 --> 01:37:28,752
I can make it from here.

1490
01:37:55,812 --> 01:37:58,463
Bugles. Trumpets.

1491
01:37:59,524 --> 01:38:01,181
Man needs seasoning.

1492
01:38:08,336 --> 01:38:09,514
Poetry!

1493
01:39:35,352 --> 01:39:38,443
Mac! Mac, I... I...

1494
01:39:39,723 --> 01:39:42,080
He did it for me.
To undo what I did!

1495
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:52,003
The last thing
Mac asked you...

1496
01:39:52,645 --> 01:39:54,652
the old man mustn't know.

1497
01:39:54,853 --> 01:39:58,049
It's just as good a way
of paying what you owe.

1498
01:41:06,123 --> 01:41:08,098
Mother McGregor.

1499
01:41:30,552 --> 01:41:32,276
Lt. John Forsythe

1500
01:41:32,568 --> 01:41:34,805
by command of His Majesty
the King-Emperor,

1501
01:41:34,936 --> 01:41:36,398
I confer upon you

1502
01:41:36,472 --> 01:41:38,602
the distinguished
service order.

1503
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:49,145
Second Lt. Donald Stone,
41st Bengal Lancers.

1504
01:41:49,664 --> 01:41:52,964
For conspicuous gallantry
and devotion to duty.

1505
01:41:53,542 --> 01:41:56,324
He attacked single-handed,
a group of the enemy

1506
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:58,113
and killed their leader

1507
01:41:58,181 --> 01:42:00,602
thus demoralizing
hostile forces

1508
01:42:00,677 --> 01:42:02,774
at a moment when
the success of our arms

1509
01:42:02,844 --> 01:42:05,202
at Mogala was in the balance.

1510
01:42:10,861 --> 01:42:12,748
Second Lt. Donald Stone

1511
01:42:13,164 --> 01:42:15,466
by Command of His Majesty
the King-Emperor

1512
01:42:15,532 --> 01:42:18,386
I confer upon you the
distinguished service order.

1513
01:42:36,537 --> 01:42:38,425
Lt. Alan McGregor

1514
01:42:38,553 --> 01:42:41,204
41st Bengal Lancers,
deceased.

1515
01:42:41,819 --> 01:42:43,166
For valor.

1516
01:42:43,424 --> 01:42:45,431
At the sacrifice of his life

1517
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,925
he destroyed enemy
ammunition supplies

1518
01:42:48,255 --> 01:42:51,244
contributing thereby
to the success of our arms

1519
01:42:51,538 --> 01:42:53,354
in the action at Mogala.

1520
01:43:01,734 --> 01:43:05,313
His Majesty the King-Emperor
has been graciously pleased

1521
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:08,418
to confer posthumously
the Victoria Cross

1522
01:43:08,621 --> 01:43:10,311
upon the late
Lt. McGregor.

1523
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,800
In accordance with
the custom of this regiment

1524
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:14,015
I place this cross

1525
01:43:14,086 --> 01:43:15,901
upon the saddlecloth
of his horse.

1526
01:43:16,305 --> 01:44:16,555
