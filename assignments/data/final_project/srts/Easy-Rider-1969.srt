1
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,624
Hey, you got a room?

2
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,838
Hey, man!

3
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,217
You got a room?

4
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,858
You asshole!

5
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,536
{y:i}l'm going down to Mardi Gras
{y:i}to get me a Mardi Gras queen

6
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,873
Oh, man. Wow, Mardi Gras!

7
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,584
That'll be the weirdest, you know?

8
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,796
You know what we
ought to do first thing?

9
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,591
Go and get us a groovy dinner.

10
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,386
Break out some of that cash, man.

11
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:46,647
Out here in the wilderness, fighting
lndians and cowboys on every side.

12
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,694
What's the matter? You zonked?
Really zonked, eh?

13
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,614
No, I'm just kind of tired.

14
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,618
You're pulling inside. You're
getting a little distance tonight.

15
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,287
You're getting a little distance, man.

16
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,084
Well, I'm just
getting my thing together.

17
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,816
Come on, it's checkout time!

18
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,110
Hey, Billy!

19
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,362
Man, don't do that.

20
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:02,824
Howdy!

21
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,370
What can I do for you?

22
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,498
I'd like to fix my flat,
if you don't mind.

23
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,667
No, I don't mind.

24
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,170
In the barn there,
you'll find any tools you'll need.

25
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,840
Whoa, baby! Whoa, honey!

26
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,135
Turn that thing off.
You're making my horse skittish.

27
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,144
Sure is a good-looking machine.

28
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,885
There you go.

29
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,145
You fellows can sit down here.

30
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,409
Would you mind taking off your hat?

31
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:43,550
We thank thee, Lord, for these
thy gifts received from thy bounty.

32
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,094
In the name of
Thy only begotten Son...

33
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:49,806
...Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

34
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,987
Where you fellows from?

35
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,365
L.A.

36
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,784
L.A.?

37
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,494
Los Angeles.

38
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,995
Los Angeles.

39
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,580
Is that a fact?

40
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,916
When I was a young man...

41
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,419
...l was headed for California, but....

42
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,422
Well, you know how it is.

43
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,975
You sure got a nice spread here.

44
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,271
Yeah, I sure got a lot of them.

45
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,648
My wife is Catholic, you know?

46
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,154
Can we have some more coffee?

47
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,080
No, I mean it.

48
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,207
You've got a nice place.

49
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,711
It's not every man that
can live off the land, you know?

50
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,881
Can do your own thing in your own time.

51
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,716
You should be proud.

52
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,373
Hey, man, what are you doing?

53
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,170
I got to talk to you, man.

54
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,428
Everything we ever dreamed of
is in that gas tank.

55
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,139
You got a stranger pouring
gasoline on it.

56
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,559
All he's got to do is look into it
and he can see--

57
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,895
He won't know what it is, man.

58
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,773
Don't worry, Billy.
Everything's all right.

59
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,192
All right, man. I don't know.

60
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,693
I do.

61
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,655
Everything's fine, Billy.

62
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,712
That's all taken care of.

63
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,215
I like that.

64
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:06,178
-How much further do we got to go?
-I don't know.

65
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,306
Not much further.

66
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,060
That's what you said this morning.

67
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,855
I sometimes say it all day.

68
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,733
Really? You say it all day?

69
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:22,653
We don't have much longer.
We'll be there soon.

70
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:26,406
We got to get to Mardi Gras, man.

71
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,909
Your little heart is set on that, huh?

72
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,036
We got a week.

73
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,956
That's a week away, man.

74
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:36,834
It's a long way to Mardi Gras, baby.

75
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:41,046
It won't take us a week
to get to New Orleans.

76
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,059
I think I'm going to crash.

77
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,645
I think you have crashed, man.

78
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:11,034
I keep seeing things
jumping all over the place.

79
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,954
-Really?
-Yeah, look.

80
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,082
-What is it?
-It's a moth.

81
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,542
A what?

82
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,919
Moth. Bug.

83
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,595
This is a weird place, man.

84
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,140
That smoke's getting to me.

85
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,519
But I notice you're not moving.

86
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,027
Where are you from, man?

87
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:48,822
Can I have a light?

88
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,866
Where are you from, man?

89
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,370
Hard to say.

90
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:56,914
Hard to say?

91
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,790
Where are you from, man?

92
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,753
It's hard to say because
it's a very long word, you know?

93
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,298
I just want to know
where you're from.

94
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,719
The city.

95
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,971
From a city?

96
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,392
Doesn't matter what city.
They're all alike.

97
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:19,269
That's why I'm out here now.

98
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,522
That's why you're out here now?

99
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,190
Why?

100
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,943
Because I'm a long way from the city...

101
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,779
...and that's where
I want to be right now.

102
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,243
They know you in this place?

103
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,413
This place we're coming to?

104
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,958
The place where we're at now?

105
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,253
This place.

106
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,386
You're right on top of them.

107
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,680
I'm right on top of them?

108
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:59,268
The people this place belongs to
are buried right under you.

109
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,690
You could be a trifle polite.

110
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,984
"A trifle polite"?

111
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,946
A small thing to ask.

112
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,749
You ever want to be somebody else?

113
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,463
I'd like to try Porky Pig.

114
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,805
I never wanted to be anybody else.

115
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,679
You can't hit me. I'm invisible!

116
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,397
Hey, Sarah. How's it going?

117
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:01,116
Rudolph, what are you eating?

118
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,287
Thanks for the stuff you brought.

119
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,747
How's it going?

120
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,168
We can't take any more strangers.
Just too many people dropping in.

121
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,880
I'm not talking about
you and your friends.

122
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:19,718
Last week, Susan dropped in
with 1 2 people from Easter City.

123
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,846
She wanted to take
1 0 pounds of rice with her.

124
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,932
Naturally, we had to say no.

125
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,061
So she gets uptight, breaks out
some hash and won't give us any.

126
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,813
They went outside
to start their bus...

127
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:33,732
...and couldn't get it started.

128
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:37,402
I bet you haven't had anybody around
like me to rap to.

129
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,989
You know I love you
and I want you to rap.

130
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,784
-Oh, God! I want you to rap.
-Cut that out.

131
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,578
I guess nobody else here
is interested...

132
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,289
...but I'd sure like
to meet your friend.

133
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,000
I bet you'd like to do more than that.

134
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,545
I think he's beautiful.

135
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,046
He's beautiful.

136
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,091
What's that weird thing on the hill?

137
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,469
It looks like a stage.
You got a light opera company?

138
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,429
That's the mime troupe stage.

139
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,974
They've gone down to the hot springs.

140
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,934
Mime troupe?

141
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,145
Hey, Lisa?

142
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,982
What does this mean?

143
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:18,318
"Starting brings misfortune.

144
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:22,030
Perseverance brings danger.

145
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:26,952
Not every demand for change
in the existing order should be heeded.

146
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,622
On the other hand,
repeated and well-founded complaints...

147
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:33,125
...should not fail to a hearing."

148
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,376
Well, when one--

149
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:37,087
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!

150
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:41,466
We've come to play for our dinner...

151
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,220
...or should I say,
stay for our dinner.

152
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,389
Or even...

153
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,892
...slay for our dinner.

154
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,396
Men at war.
How ghastly, ghastly!

155
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,107
We've come to drink your wine...

156
00:30:57,316 --> 00:31:01,403
...taste your food
and take pleasure in your women.

157
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:04,114
The water in that river
is about 80 degrees.

158
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,618
You put your hand in a foot away,
it's below freezing.

159
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:10,787
Oh, come on.
I've got to get dinner on.

160
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,581
Who said "out" to me?

161
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,292
I picked--
Unhand me! I played communes--

162
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,252
Out! Out!

163
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,755
Evil eye on this place.

164
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,673
A double whammy for you all.

165
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:27,095
Come, my dear.
We won't play here.

166
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,061
Get out.

167
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:35,896
I like you.

168
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,783
These people got here
late in the summer.

169
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,911
Too late to plant.
But the weather was beautiful...

170
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,373
...and it was easy living.
And then came that winter.

171
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,126
There were 40 or 50
living in a one-room place.

172
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:03,048
Nothing to eat, out by the side
of the road looking for dead horses.

173
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:05,092
Anything they could get ahold of.

174
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:08,929
There's 1 8 or 20 left.
And they're city kids. Look at them.

175
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,562
But they're getting this crop in.

176
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:20,941
They'll stay here till it's harvested.
That's the whole thing.

177
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,325
Do you get much rain here, man?

178
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:33,453
I guess we'll have to dance for that.

179
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,720
Look at this, man. A seashell.

180
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:57,686
There's nothing but sand.
They ain't going to make it.

181
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,355
They're going to make it.

182
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,152
They're going to make it.

183
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,541
We have planted our seeds.

184
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,337
We ask...

185
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:51,091
...that our efforts be worthy...

186
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:54,845
...to produce simple food...

187
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,764
...for our simple taste.

188
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,187
We ask that our efforts...

189
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:05,898
...be rewarded.

190
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:13,614
We thank You for the food
we eat from other hands...

191
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:21,955
...that we may share it
with our fellow man...

192
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,335
...and be even more generous...

193
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:29,671
...when it is from our own.

194
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,429
Thank You for a place...

195
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,516
...to make a stand.

196
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:50,901
Amen.

197
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,906
Let's eat.

198
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,455
Hark ye gentles! Hark ye all.

199
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:06,375
Time has come for curtain call.

200
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:13,382
{y:i}How do you wear your hair
{y:i}Does your hair hang low

201
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:16,802
{y:i}Do you tie it in a ribbon
{y:i}Do you tie it in a bow

202
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,890
{y:i}Do you wear it over your shoulder
{y:i}Like a Continental soldier....

203
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,879
Are you an Aquarius?

204
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,515
Pisces?

205
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,445
I guessed right.

206
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:23,744
Do you like our place here?

207
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,120
Who sent you?

208
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,986
I got to get out of here, man.

209
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,781
We got things we want to do, man.

210
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,492
I got to get out of here, man.

211
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:52,207
Could you take me and my friend
over across the canyon?

212
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,042
Yeah, anything.

213
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:57,421
It won't be out of
your way, honest.

214
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,047
It's all right.

215
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,550
It's all right.

216
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,180
We're not no traveling bureau.

217
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,640
Why don't they get their own ride?

218
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,143
We're eating their food.

219
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,024
All right, man.

220
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,660
-Get them together though, man.
-Right.

221
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:37,808
When you get to the right place,
with the right people...

222
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,726
...quarter this.

223
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,064
You know, this could be
the right place.

224
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,192
Your time's running out.

225
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:48,735
Hey, man!

226
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:52,614
If we're going, we're going.
Let's go!

227
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,458
I'm hip about time.

228
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,297
But I just got to go.

229
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:19,326
Parading without a permit?
Do you know who this is, man?

230
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:23,580
This is Captain America. I'm Billy.
We're headliners, baby.

231
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,335
We played every fair in this part of
the country. For top dollar!

232
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:59,491
Weirdo hicks, man.
A bunch of weirdo hicks.

233
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:04,413
Parading without a permit, man!

234
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:31,356
Oh, no!
What did I do now?

235
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,655
Oh, what am I going to do now?

236
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:43,827
Oh, my head!

237
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:49,958
All right, George.
What're you going to do now?

238
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,836
You promised these people, now.

239
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:57,382
You promised these people
and you promised these people....

240
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,387
Hey, would you mind?

241
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:04,473
You just woke my friend up.

242
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:11,563
I'm real sorry.
I didn't realize l....

243
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,900
I didn't realize.

244
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:22,199
My head.

245
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:27,204
If you don't shut your mouth,
you won't have a head!

246
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:49,518
I see you're up, Mr. Hansen.
You'll feel a lot better after this.

247
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:55,357
Thank you, Bob.

248
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:02,656
I guess I really
tied one on last night.

249
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,576
Must've had a hell of a good time.

250
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,495
I wish I could remember it.

251
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:15,919
Could you get me a cigarette?

252
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,215
You animals ain't smart enough
to play with fire.

253
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:23,719
They're good boys.
You can give them a cigarette.

254
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,515
Thanks, mister.

255
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,520
Got a match?

256
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:38,108
Thank you, Bob.

257
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:49,703
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.

258
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:55,083
There was no misunderstanding.
We're all in the same cage here.

259
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:01,089
You must be some important dude.
That treatment--

260
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:02,549
" Dude"?

261
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,470
What does he mean, "dude"?
Dude ranch?

262
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,644
" Dude" means a nice guy, you know?

263
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,188
" Dude" means a regular person.

264
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:20,526
You don't look like you're from
this part of the country.

265
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:24,738
You're lucky I'm here to see
you don't get into anything.

266
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,406
Well...

267
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:29,535
...they got this here...

268
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:33,247
...scissor-happy,
beautify-America thing here.

269
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:36,500
Trying to make everybody
look like Yul Brynner.

270
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:41,463
They used rusty razor blades
on the last two longhairs...

271
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:44,800
...they brought in.
I wasn't here to protect them.

272
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,260
See...

273
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:50,222
...l'm a lawyer.

274
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:52,933
Done a lot of work for the ACLU.

275
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,768
George Hansen.

276
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:01,149
You think you can help us
get out of here?

277
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:06,446
I imagine that I can
if you haven't killed anybody.

278
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:09,783
At least nobody white.

279
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:17,499
See there? $25.
Not too bad for no razor blades.

280
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:18,709
You know?

281
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:21,587
-Very groovy. Thank you.
-Very groovy.

282
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:24,798
See? I'll bet nobody ever
said that to you.

283
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:28,135
By the way, thanks
for the aspirin before.

284
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,012
I'm getting to....

285
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:33,974
I'm getting to think you're
a regular " regular" here.

286
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,476
I'm not going to tell your dad.

287
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:39,021
You just got to be more careful.

288
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:44,276
That'd be good if the powers that be
wouldn't hear about this.

289
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,405
The old man's not feeling good.
Know what I mean?

290
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:53,327
Well, now, George, we won't tell
your dad about that.

291
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,455
-Isn't that right?
-That's right.

292
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:02,878
What do you say we look at these super
machines we been hearing about?

293
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:04,838
Let's get it on.

294
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,383
Thanks a lot, Bob.
See you later.

295
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,517
I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

296
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:20,103
All right, Carl.

297
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,398
Thanks a million.
Say hello to the missus.

298
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:30,280
Here's to the first
of the day, fellas.

299
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:35,077
To old D.H. Lawrence.

300
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,049
Indians!

301
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:01,144
Thank you.

302
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:04,064
You know...

303
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:10,112
...l must've started off to Mardi Gras
six or seven times.

304
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:13,866
Never got further than the state line.

305
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:18,662
The governor of Louisiana
gave me this.

306
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,999
" Madame Tinkertoy's
House of Blue Lights.

307
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,460
Bourbon and Toulouse,
New Orleans, Louisiana."

308
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:30,465
Now this is supposed to be
the finest whorehouse in the South.

309
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:35,721
These ain't no pork chops.
These are U.S. prime.

310
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:37,472
Out of sight, man!

311
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:40,350
Oh, I'd like to get over there.

312
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:46,648
How long did you boys say
it would take you to get down there?

313
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,484
-Two or three days.
-Two or three days?

314
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,236
Is that right?

315
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:55,574
Boy, I sure wish
I was going with you.

316
00:51:57,743 --> 00:51:59,119
You got a helmet?

317
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:07,002
Oh, I've got a helmet!
I got a beauty!

318
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:42,741
Well, old buddy, I never thought
I'd ever see you again.

319
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:47,746
You know, I threw this thing away
one week ago.

320
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:52,709
My mother, of all people, retrieved it.
I can't understand.

321
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,965
She didn't want me to play football.
Always afraid I'd get hurt.

322
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:01,510
And here, 1 2 years later,
I find it on my pillow...

323
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:06,723
...with a note pinned next to it
saying, "Save this for your son."

324
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:15,524
Fire!

325
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:19,570
Do this instead.

326
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:25,075
No, thanks. I got some
store-bought here of my own.

327
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:28,203
No, man. This is grass.

328
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:31,707
You mean, marijuana?

329
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:39,464
Lord have mercy!
ls that what that is?

330
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,721
Let me see that.

331
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:57,191
Go ahead. Light it up.

332
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:59,693
Oh, no, no, no...

333
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:04,072
...l couldn't do that.
I've got enough problems...

334
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:08,202
...with the booze and all.
I can't afford to get hooked.

335
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:12,456
You won't get hooked.

336
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:17,211
Well, I know.
But it leads to harder stuff.

337
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:28,013
You say it's all right?

338
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:38,273
Well, all right then.
How do I do it?

339
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:40,150
Here.

340
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,758
That's got a real nice taste to it.

341
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:08,846
Though I don't suppose it'll
do me much good.

342
00:57:09,054 --> 00:57:10,681
I'm so used to the booze.

343
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:15,185
You've got to hold it
in your lungs longer.

344
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,575
What...

345
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:33,871
...was that, man?
What the hell was that?

346
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:39,209
I don't know, man.
I was watching this object...

347
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:41,295
...like the satellite we saw.

348
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:44,798
And it went right across the sky.
And then....

349
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:47,551
I mean, it just suddenly....

350
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,890
It just changed direction and went
whizzing off. It flashed and--

351
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:55,475
You're stoned out of your mind.

352
00:57:55,726 --> 00:58:00,397
Oh, yeah. I'm stoned, man.
But, like, I saw a satellite.

353
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:05,652
And it was going across the sky,
and it flashed three times at me...

354
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:08,197
...and zigzagged and whizzed off.

355
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:10,449
And I saw it.

356
00:58:12,326 --> 00:58:16,705
That was a UFO beaming back at you.

357
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:21,293
Me and Eric Heisman
was down in Mexico two weeks ago.

358
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:24,963
We seen 40 of them
flying in formation.

359
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:28,592
They've got bases
all over the world now.

360
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,678
They've been coming here
ever since 1 946...

361
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:36,308
...when scientists started
bouncing radar beams off the moon.

362
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:40,479
And they've been living
and working among us ever since.

363
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:43,315
The government knows all about them.

364
00:58:43,857 --> 00:58:45,776
What are you talking, man?

365
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:49,196
You just seen one of them,
didn't you?

366
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:53,825
I saw something, but I didn't
see it working here.

367
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:57,621
Well, they are people,
just like us...

368
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:00,332
...from within our own solar system.

369
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:04,086
Except that their society is
more highly evolved.

370
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:08,006
They don't have no wars.
They got no monetary system.

371
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:12,427
They don't have any leaders,
because each man is a leader.

372
00:59:12,678 --> 00:59:15,764
Because of their technology...

373
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:20,519
...they're able to feed, clothe, house
and transport themselves...

374
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:23,438
...equally and with no effort.

375
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:37,953
You know something?
You want to know what I think?

376
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:42,457
I think this is a crackpot idea.
That's what I think.

377
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,294
How about that?

378
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:48,463
Think it's a crackpot idea.

379
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:53,135
If they're so smart,
why don't they reveal themselves...

380
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:54,970
...and get it over with?

381
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,349
Why don't they reveal themselves
is because if they did...

382
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,643
...it'd cause a general panic.

383
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:04,521
Now, we still have leaders...

384
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:08,400
...upon whom we rely
to release this information.

385
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:13,530
These leaders have decided
to repress this information...

386
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,824
...because of the shock...

387
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:19,912
...that it would cause
to our antiquated systems.

388
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:25,000
Now, the result of this has been
that the Venusians...

389
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:29,379
...have contacted people
at all walks of life...

390
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:31,632
...all walks of life....

391
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:53,153
It would be a devastating blow to
our antiquated systems.

392
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:57,950
Now Venusians are meeting with people
in all walks of life...

393
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,369
...in an advisory capacity.

394
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:03,956
For once, man will have
a godlike control...

395
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:08,961
...over his own destiny.
He'll have a chance to transcend...

396
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:12,840
...and to evolve
with some equality for all.

397
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:22,724
How's your joint, George?

398
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:30,482
I believe it went out.

399
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:35,445
I got to talking so much,
I clean forgot about....

400
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,574
It went out.

401
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,877
Save it and we'll do it
tomorrow morning.

402
01:01:50,127 --> 01:01:53,172
It gives you a new way
of looking at the day.

403
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:58,385
Well, I sure could use that.

404
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:02,931
I sure could use a little of that.

405
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,694
What the hell is this?
Troublemakers?

406
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:07,074
You name it,
I'll throw rocks at it, Sheriff.

407
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:11,036
Y'all, check what just walked in.

408
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,831
I like the one in the red shirt
with suspenders.

409
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,291
White shirt for me.

410
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,294
I like something
with black pants on.

411
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:24,424
-What did you say?
-I said--

412
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:26,510
What?

413
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:33,475
I can't believe.
What are they doing here?

414
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:37,396
-Look at the teeth around his neck.
-Did they drive motorcycles?

415
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:39,690
They know we're talking about them.

416
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:42,943
Hot damn!

417
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:44,236
I'll tell you.

418
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:48,574
I'll order kidneys, because
I left mine out on the road somewhere.

419
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:53,996
-I like his hair all down his head.
-And I like his eyes.

420
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:56,790
You know that girl over there
in the corner?

421
01:05:58,542 --> 01:06:02,337
Don't look too close because
the sheriff's right over there.

422
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:03,881
You know what I mean?

423
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:07,176
-Check that joker with long hair.
-I checked him.

424
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:10,888
We might have to bring him
to the Hilton before it's over.

425
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:13,432
-I think she's cute.
-Isn't she though?

426
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:15,684
We'll put him in a woman's cell.

427
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:19,980
We ought to put them in a cage
and charge admission to see them.

428
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:24,818
Those are what are known as
country witticisms.

429
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:26,904
I can't believe they're here.

430
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:29,573
Let's ask them to take us for a ride.

431
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,116
Don't be foolish!

432
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:34,244
They'll think you--
He'll laugh in your face.

433
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:37,331
-Yeah, that'd be good.
-I doubt it.

434
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:39,666
-I'm going to ask them.
-Be my guest.

435
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:42,002
Not when I'm around.

436
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:43,962
I don't think you're going to.

437
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:45,506
Go ahead.

438
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:51,970
I thought at first
that bunch over there...

439
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:54,932
...their mothers were
frightened by gorillas...

440
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:57,226
...but now I think they were caught.

441
01:06:57,434 --> 01:06:59,478
I think one's Alley Oop...

442
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,188
...from the beads on him.

443
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:03,649
One of them darn sure is not Oola.

444
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:08,028
Look like a bunch of refugees
from a gorilla love-in.

445
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:11,823
-A gorilla couldn't love that.
-Nor could a mother.

446
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:16,370
I wish you could mate him up
with one of those black wenches.

447
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,872
Oh, now, I don't know about that.

448
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:22,000
And that's about as low as they come.

449
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:23,252
He's a biggie.

450
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:24,711
And they're green.

451
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,173
-No, they're not green, they're white.
-White?

452
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:31,260
You're colour-blind.
I just got to say that.

453
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,095
Sure like to get some food.

454
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:38,058
I thought jails were built for
humanity, and that won't quite qualify.

455
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:43,272
-Wonder where they got those wigs.
-They probably grew them.

456
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,233
-Nothing else would grow on them.
-You know...

457
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:49,319
...l'm not real hungry at the moment.

458
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:51,780
You know what I mean?

459
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:55,784
I saw two of them one time
just kissing away.

460
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,286
Two males. Think of it!

461
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:02,749
What should we do with them?

462
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:06,920
I don't know, but I don't think
they'll make the parish line.

463
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:13,468
Let's split.

464
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:14,887
Split?

465
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:22,477
Yes, sir.

466
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,397
It certainly has been nice.

467
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:34,823
They got fancy bikes.
That's some Yankee queers.

468
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:37,284
Check the flag on that bike.

469
01:08:37,993 --> 01:08:39,578
It sure is.

470
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:43,749
I still say they're not going to
make the parish line.

471
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:51,173
Hey, can I have a ride?

472
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,841
You want a ride?

473
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:56,053
You got a note from your moms?

474
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:58,138
Oh, our mothers won't mind.

475
01:08:58,388 --> 01:09:00,641
Please let us have a ride.

476
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:04,186
I don't mind giving you a ride.

477
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,982
{y:i}The man is at the window

478
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:15,155
{y:i}The man is at the window!

479
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:17,908
I'd love to take
you girls for a ride.

480
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:53,652
You know...

481
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:57,489
...this used to be
a hell of a good country.

482
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:01,869
I can't understand
what's gone wrong with it.

483
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:07,541
Everybody got chicken, that's what.

484
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:11,003
We can't even get into
a second-rate hotel.

485
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:14,089
I mean, a second-rate motel, you dig?

486
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:17,968
They think we'd cut their throat.
They're scared.

487
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:20,053
They're not scared of you.

488
01:10:20,304 --> 01:10:23,390
They're scared of
what you represent to them.

489
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:28,270
All we represent to them
is somebody who needs a haircut.

490
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,646
Oh, no.

491
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,107
What you represent to them...

492
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:33,567
...is freedom.

493
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:35,944
Freedom's what it's all about.

494
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:39,239
Oh yeah, that's right.
That's what it's all about.

495
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,742
But talking about it and being it...

496
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:44,077
...that's two different things.

497
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:46,747
It's real hard to be free...

498
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:50,459
...when you are bought and sold
in the marketplace.

499
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:57,341
Don't tell anybody that they're not
free, because they'll get busy...

500
01:10:57,549 --> 01:11:01,303
...killing and maiming
to prove to you that they are.

501
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:04,806
They're going to talk to you
and talk to you...

502
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:07,684
...about individual freedom.

503
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:12,564
But they see a free individual,
it's going to scare them.

504
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:15,901
Well, it don't make them
running scared.

505
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:20,489
It makes them dangerous.

506
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:31,959
Swamp.

507
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:40,926
Swamp.

508
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:50,519
Do you ever....

509
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:54,898
You ever talk to bullfrogs
in the middle of the night?

510
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,775
Not generally.

511
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:58,861
-You don't?
-No, man.

512
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:01,572
You know what I used to do?

513
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:04,616
What did you used to do?

514
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:06,994
One thing I didn't used to do...

515
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:11,373
...is talk to bullfrogs
in the middle of the night, foolish.

516
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:12,833
You're out of your mind!

517
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:14,918
That's right.

518
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:55,018
Oh, God.

519
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:02,526
What are we going to do
with his stuff, man?

520
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:07,322
Get it to his folks somehow.

521
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:14,830
There's not much here, man.

522
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:19,418
There's some money,
and there's his driver's license.

523
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:22,504
Here's his card, man.

524
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:26,091
He ain't going to be using that.

525
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:59,708
We'll go there for
just one drink, man.

526
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:24,733
No man, now really.
He would've wanted us to, man.

527
01:16:25,294 --> 01:16:30,090
" If God did not exist,
it would be necessary to invent Him."

528
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:34,803
That's a humdinger.

529
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:41,476
I'm getting a little smashed, man.

530
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:43,353
A little smashed.

531
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:03,165
Wow, it's hot in here, man.

532
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:10,255
Chicks, man.

533
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:17,137
Look at those chicks, man.

534
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,959
Goodbye, girls.

535
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:48,585
Later.

536
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:50,921
Hi! Howdy!

537
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:53,841
My name is Billy.

538
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,385
And this here is Captain America.

539
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:58,428
Excuse me one minute, ladies.

540
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,722
Do you mind if I take the tall one?

541
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:03,559
-No, that's all right.
-Oh, thank you.

542
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:13,861
Come on, you little Hereford.
Get yourself over here.

543
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:16,738
You old thing, you.

544
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:21,159
I'm really from New York.
This is all just a weird act.

545
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:23,871
You're a freak, aren't you?

546
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:27,207
My name is Mary.

547
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:35,966
You want a drink?

548
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:37,217
No, thanks.

549
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:39,386
What's this?

550
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:41,847
-Is this really your hair?
-What is this?

551
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:44,766
Is this really your hair?
Are you kidding me?

552
01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:49,021
-What are these things?
-What are these things, huh?

553
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:50,856
I'm kind of a freak myself.

554
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:54,776
I never really thought
of myself as a freak.

555
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:57,237
But I'd love to freak.

556
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:01,033
What's happening outside?

557
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:02,451
What?

558
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:06,413
You know, in the street.
Mardi Gras.

559
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:09,750
Well, you know,
it's crowded and all that.

560
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:18,717
Hey, you want a drink?

561
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:26,016
Here's to you.

562
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:27,684
Thank you.

563
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:35,192
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

564
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:36,860
What?

565
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:38,570
You paid for me.

566
01:19:40,822 --> 01:19:43,909
That was for my friend.

567
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:47,287
I don't....

568
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:49,957
I'll buy you a drink.

569
01:19:50,374 --> 01:19:52,084
I don't drink.

570
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:03,345
I've got an idea.

571
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:05,430
Let's go outside.

572
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:16,233
We'll all go to Mardi Gras.

573
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:19,166
What's that?

574
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:21,668
What's that?

575
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:26,048
Never mind.
Just shut up and take it.

576
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,925
Yeah, right.

577
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:37,100
What do you do with it?

578
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:40,437
Give it to me.

579
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:43,982
-Just shut up and take it.
-Put it on your tongue.

580
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:01,375
I believe in God...

581
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:05,671
...Father Almighty...

582
01:24:06,755 --> 01:24:08,799
...creator of heaven and earth.

583
01:24:12,302 --> 01:24:17,140
Going up for the last time,
the last time, the last time.

584
01:24:19,017 --> 01:24:23,397
--was crucified, died and was buried.
He descended into hell.

585
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:25,941
The third day,
He rose from the dead.

586
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:30,612
He ascended into heaven
and sits at the right hand of God...

587
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:32,239
...creator of heaven and earth.

588
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:36,368
I believe in God, Father Almighty,
creator of heaven and earth.

589
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:39,663
And in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord--

590
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:42,165
-Shut up.
-Conceived by the Holy Ghost...

591
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:45,752
...born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate...

592
01:24:45,961 --> 01:24:49,756
...was crucified, died and was buried.
He descended into hell.

593
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:52,009
The third day,
He rose from the dead.

594
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:56,722
He ascended into heaven
and sits at the right hand of God.

595
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:59,474
He shall come to judge
the living and the dead.

596
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:03,020
I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the holy Catholic Church...

597
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:06,023
...communion of saints,
forgiveness of sins...

598
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:10,360
...the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.

599
01:25:11,862 --> 01:25:15,115
How could you make me
hate you so much?

600
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:20,996
I hate you so much.

601
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:24,958
-I want you to be beautiful.
-I always wanted to be pretty.

602
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:28,545
Listen to me.
I want you to be beautiful.

603
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:31,632
No! You know me.

604
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:35,427
I know you.

605
01:25:35,636 --> 01:25:38,180
Baby. Okay. Okay.

606
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:40,265
Come back!

607
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:43,810
I know you.

608
01:25:46,104 --> 01:25:48,357
--full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

609
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:51,985
Blessed are thou amongst women....

610
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:53,237
Make me loveable.

611
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:57,324
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners....

612
01:25:57,533 --> 01:26:00,369
I know it.
I know you. I know you.

613
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:09,419
Look at them. We're all aglow.

614
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:14,049
Look at us. We're all aglow!
Look. Glow!

615
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:17,177
Where's your John?

616
01:26:17,427 --> 01:26:19,137
I don't know why I like you.

617
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:23,308
-I don't even know if I like you.
-I know I like you.

618
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:26,061
I know I like you.

619
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:32,234
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare!

620
01:26:32,442 --> 01:26:34,111
I can feel the outside.

621
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:36,947
I can feel the outside
but I can't...

622
01:26:37,155 --> 01:26:40,576
...l can't feel the inside.

623
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:44,663
Don't stop! Don't stop!
I'm dying!

624
01:26:44,913 --> 01:26:48,083
I'm going to die!
I'm going to die!

625
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,252
I'm dead.

626
01:26:50,711 --> 01:26:53,547
I'm dead.
Do you understand?

627
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:58,135
Mary loved....

628
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:06,602
Oh, dear God, please let it be!
Please help me conceive a child!

629
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:09,021
I'm right out here.

630
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:13,650
I'm right out here.
I'm right out here.

631
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:16,862
I'm right here, out of my head.

632
01:27:17,446 --> 01:27:18,947
I'm conceiving!

633
01:27:19,156 --> 01:27:23,744
Please, God,
let me out of here!

634
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:29,333
I want to get out of here.

635
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,755
Do you know what I mean?

636
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:38,133
You wanted me ugly, didn't you?
I know you, John.

637
01:27:38,342 --> 01:27:41,011
I hate you so much.

638
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:44,139
You never knew about me.

639
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:50,687
Why did you leave like that?
Everybody else, but not you.

640
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:53,774
And not me.

641
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:56,693
I loved you.

642
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:01,323
Oh, God, how I loved you.

643
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:08,872
And you're such a cruel mother
and I hate you so much.

644
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:09,057
We've done it. We've done it.

645
01:29:09,474 --> 01:29:11,560
We're rich, Wyatt.

646
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,688
Yeah, man.

647
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:22,863
Yeah, we did it, man!
We did it.

648
01:29:25,324 --> 01:29:27,451
We're rich, man.

649
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:30,954
We're retired in Florida now, mister.

650
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:35,334
You know, Billy...

651
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:37,753
...we blew it.

652
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:40,339
What?

653
01:29:40,797 --> 01:29:44,259
Well, that's what it's all about.
Like, you know.

654
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:47,804
You go for the big money,
and then you're free.

655
01:29:48,013 --> 01:29:49,723
You dig?

656
01:29:53,644 --> 01:29:55,312
We blew it.

657
01:30:02,402 --> 01:30:03,904
Good night, man.

658
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:08,820
Look at them ginks.

659
01:32:09,071 --> 01:32:12,366
Pull alongside.
We'll scare the hell out of them.

660
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:23,001
You want me
to blow your brains out?

661
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,883
Why don't you get a haircut?

662
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:35,138
What happened?

663
01:32:51,947 --> 01:32:53,866
Oh, my God!

664
01:32:54,074 --> 01:32:57,411
-I'm going for help!
-I got them. I'll get them!

665
01:32:57,661 --> 01:32:59,037
We better go back.

666
01:33:05,127 --> 01:33:07,004
I'm going to get them.

667
01:33:09,047 --> 01:33:10,966
