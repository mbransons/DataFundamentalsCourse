<i>Guys with easy money

<i>Dolls with hidden talent

00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,250
<i>Take off for Broadway

00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,794

<i>Doorway to glory

00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:08,239
<i>You'll never get your fill of it

17
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,367
<i>Glorious, glamorous wonderland</i>

<i>New York</i>

19
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:24,380
Oh, is Mr. Benton here yet,
the agent for the apartments?

20
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,465
Oh, yes. He's in there
waiting for you now.

21
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:29,302
Thank you.

22
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,304
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Page.

23
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,306
I do hope I haven't
kept you waiting too long.

24
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,225
Not in the least. I'm afraid I have
a little disappointment for you, though.

25
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,021
You won't be able to meet Mr. Denmark.
He flew to Europe this morning.

26
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,982
Oh, dear, I am disappointed.
Wasn't that awfully sudden?

27
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:47,778
Oh, very. You know how those income tax
people are when you skip a whole year.

28
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:54,035
And the result, of course, is that
a longer lease is now possible.

29
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,581
Open, if you don't mind.

30
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:02,460
Oh, oh, certainly. Certainly.

31
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:13,888
How long a lease? Not that it matters
if he's to insist on a thousand a month.

32
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,682
That's what I wanted to
see him about, personally.

33
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,935
Oh, he won't be needing
the place for years now.

34
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:22,396
I hear Mr. Whiskers really
blew his top this time.

35
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,857
You mean he can't come back
to this country?

36
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,902
It would be I understand
the very height of folly.

37
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:33,324
Oh, I see. Well, it throws
an entirely different light.

38
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,326
Where's that lease?

39
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,536
Well, I'm afraid
I haven't got it with me.

40
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,747
Oh, never mind.
You can mail it to me.

41
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,167
This is for two months,
the first and the last.

42
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,628
- That's the deal, isn't it?
- That's correct.

43
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,755
How soon would you like
to take possession?

44
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,508
Oh, anything wrong
with right now?

45
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,761
Nothing at all. It's a little unusual,
of course, but...

46
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,264
Thank you so much, Mr. Benton.
You've been awfully kind.

47
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,391
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Page.

48
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,269
It's a genuine pleasure to do business
with a woman of such decision.

49
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,688
- We in the real estate game...
- Bye now.

50
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,649
Oh, yes, of course. Well.

51
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,735
Oh, I almost forgot.
How long shall I make the lease for?

52
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,779
Oh, a year will be quite enough.
Thank you.

53
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,115
But don't you think
you oughta have it...

54
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,217
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Bingo.

55
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,303
<i>I'll be right over.</i>

56
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,561
- To the left.
- Thanks.

57
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,993
All right, put 'em on.
No men here yet.

58
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,329
You certainly got here in a hurry.
Did you take a taxi?

59
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,789
No, I didn't have
enough money for a taxi

60
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:08,002
I had the Chrysler people demonstrate
that new showboat for me again.

61
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,671
- The one with the gold trim?
- Was it gold?

62
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:13,382
I didn't want to put on my specs
with the driver there, you know.

63
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:16,302
The one they sent for me
had gold trim.

64
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,806
Brother!

65
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,808
Smooth, huh?

66
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:26,020
Creamy. Are we really in?

67
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,856
- Built in.
- I'll call Loco.

68
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,858
Loco who?

69
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,569
You know, that girl
I was telling you about from Jersey.

70
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,571
You didn't tell me
her name was "Loco."

71
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:40,034
It isn't. That's what the other models
call her. It means crazy, you know?

72
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,036
That's what I know.

73
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,038
<i>- Hello?
- Bingo!</i>

74
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,040
- Hold that for a minute.
- Just a minute, Loke.

75
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,460
I can't shack up with a dame I haven't
even met, and she's crazy too.

76
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,838
You don't have to. All I'm going to
ask her is to come up here.

77
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,049
If you don't like her,
that's the end of it.

78
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,968
- Is she class?
- Is she. Didn't I tell you?

79
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,846
She's been on the cover of
Harper's Bazaar three times already.

80
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,848
And she knows how to handle it?

81
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:06,977
- Well, let's see if she does. Loke?
<i>- Yes?</i>

82
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,397
- How much money you got?
<i>- I've</i> got a quarter.

83
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,860
That's wonderful. Stop in on your way
up here and pick up lunch for us.

84
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,862
<i>- How many?
- Three.</i>

85
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,490
<i>Okay. Just as soon
as I get something on.</i>

86
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:24,078
There's a fine contribution to a million
dollar proposition, one whole quarter.

87
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:29,625
Maybe, but she's awful
clever with a quarter.

88
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:34,171
I just don't know how I'll ever
be able to thank you enough.

89
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,590
I'm still so embarrassed.

90
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:40,302
You have no reason to be. Anybody can
forget their money. I've done it myself.

91
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:43,431
I know, but...
Oh, hi, honey.

92
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,891
- Come on in.
- Come in.

93
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,602
This is a gentleman I met
at the cold cuts counter.

94
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,771
- What did you say your name was?
- Tom Brookman.

95
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,107
B-R-O-O-K-M-A-N.
Brookman.

96
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,443
Well, this is my friend,
Miss Pola Debevoise.

97
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,112
- How do you do?
- Oh, and this is Miss Page, isn't it?

98
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,907
- Mrs. Page.
- How do you do? It was very funny.

99
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,076
I was ordering some pastrami
and potato salad,

100
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,537
and I heard Miss Dempsey explaining
she only had a quarter...

101
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,539
You can just set that down.
We'll take it from here.

102
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,916
Oh, wouldn't you like me
to put them in the kitchen?

103
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,752
No, I don't think you'd better.
The cook's not dressed.

104
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,630
- Oh, really?
- Thank you very much.

105
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:20,134
Some other day.
Give us a ring next week.

106
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,179
- I don't know your number.
- That's all right. It's in the book.

107
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,181
Thank you very much,
Mr. Brookman.

108
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,392
- But I don't know your first name.
- He was really very nice.

109
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,394
I thought he might
have lunch with us.

110
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:33,105
Look, the first rule of this proposition
is that gentleman callers

111
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:35,149
have got to wear a necktie.

112
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,486
I don't want to be snobbish,
but if we begin with characters like that,

113
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,156
we might just as well
throw in the towel right now

114
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,760
Thanks, Mick. Keep the change.

115
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:07,264
- How do, Mr. Brookman?
- Hiya, Pete.

116
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,897
The next thing to remember is
a gentleman you meet among cold cuts

117
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,233
is simply not as attractive
as one that you meet,

118
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,401
say in the mink department
at Bergdorf's.

119
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,403
But he was cute,
don't you think?

120
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:25,491
Sure he was, but then I never met one
of those gas pump jockeys that wasn't.

121
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,993
- Is that what he is?
- You bet your life.

122
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:32,540
I know those guys. I married one once.
Very, very cute fellow.

123
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,876
- I didn't know you were really married.
- Just got back from Reno.

124
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,504
Oh, then you must be loaded.

125
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:43,092
Mine was one of those divorces you don't
read about. The wife finished second.

126
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,636
But that's against the law, isn't it?

127
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,431
I was absolutely nuts about that guy,
and you know what he did to me?

128
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,600
First off, he gives me
a phony name.

129
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:54,144
Second, it turns out
he was already married yet.

130
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,397
Third, from the minute
the preacher said, "Amen,"

131
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,941
he never did
another tap of work.

132
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,945
The next thing I knew he'd stolen my
television set and given it to a carhop.

133
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,656
When I ask him how about that,
he hits me with a chicken.

134
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,784
- A live chicken?
- No, a baked chicken, stuffed.

135
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,287
He sounds incompatible to me.

136
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,709
Last I saw of him, I stepped out of
the car for a minute at a gas station.

137
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,711
I had to walk home.

138
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,755
Well, I'm surprised
you'd ever want to get married again.

139
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,134
Oh, but that's the point
about this whole setup.

140
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:27,261
Of course I want to
get married again.

141
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,929
Who doesn't?

142
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:31,849
It's the biggest thing
you can do in life.

143
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,438
The way most people go about it,
they use more brains

144
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,608
picking a horse in the third at Belmont
than they do picking a husband.

145
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,693
- Do they really?
- It's your head you've got to use,

146
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,154
- not your heart.
- Oh, I see.

147
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,948
Tell her your idea
about this apartment.

148
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,326
Well, to put it simply,
the idea is this.

149
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,870
If you had your choice
of everybody in the world,

150
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,040
which would you rather marry,
a rich guy or a poor one?

151
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,042
I think I'd rather marry a rich one.

152
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,961
All right. Where would you
be most likely to meet a rich one,

153
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:04,798
in a walk-up on Amsterdam Avenue
or in a joint like this?

154
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,800
Well...

155
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,802
I should say in a joint like this.

156
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,639
Okay, then, that's it.
We're all working steady,

157
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,266
so we throw everything
we make into the kitty,

158
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,602
and get a little organization
into this marriage caper.

159
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:20,439
Class address, class background,
class characters.

160
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,817
To be specific about it,
nothing under six figures a year.

161
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,278
I've never heard anything
so intelligent in my life.

162
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,906
If you want to catch a mouse,
you set a mousetrap.

163
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,824
So, all right,
we set a bear trap.

164
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,078
All we've got to do is one of us
has got to knock off a bear.

165
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,330
- You mean marry him?
- If you don't marry him,

166
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,458
you haven't caught him,
he's caught you.

167
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,337
All my life, ever since I was a little
girl, I've had the same dream,

168
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,465
to marry a zillionaire.

169
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,467
Do you know who I'd like to marry?

170
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,469
- Who?
- Rockefeller.

171
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,847
- Which one?
- I don't care.

172
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,725
I wouldn't mind marrying
a Vanderbilt.

173
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,977
Or a Mr. Cadillac.

174
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,271
No such person. I checked.

175
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,774
Is there a Mr. Texaco?

176
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:08,195
No. But how about one
of those rich maharajas?

177
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,197
How about three of them?

178
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,450
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had three
of them for dinner and they married us?

179
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,536
Think of all those
diamonds and rubies.

180
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,873
And all those crazy elephants.

181
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,710
This is really living it up, isn't it?

182
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:25,546
People that live any other way
are just crazy.

183
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,548
I wonder who's going to pay for it.

184
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,259
- Yeah, how about that?
- Well, I'll tell you.

185
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,469
I knew it couldn't last.

186
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:36,473
Relax, will you? And somebody
break open that other bottle.

187
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:45,315
Good afternoon. I'm Mr. Bennett
of the Bennett Music Company.

188
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,317
- Are you the lady...
- That's right. Come right in.

189
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,486
Thank you.

190
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,073
The reason I called you is,

191
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:56,994
what will you give me
for this piano, cash?

192
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,372
Well,

193
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:02,833
it's a very handsome instrument.

194
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:11,842
Really, Pola, I think she's the most
intelligent person I guess I ever met.

195
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,722
Well, it's not in first-class condition,
you understand,

196
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:21,393
but we might be interested
in paying you, say 2,500?

197
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:24,146
We'll take it.

198
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,695
Well, kids,
where will we eat tonight,

199
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,697
the Stork or 21?

200
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,178
Hello?

201
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,139
<i>Is this Trafalgar 7-5098?</i>

202
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,308
<i>- Yes?
- Who's this, Miss Page?</i>

203
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,770
<i>- Yes, who is this?
- This is Tom Brookman.</i>

204
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,897
- Oh.
- You remember me.

205
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,650
- Oh, sure, but...
- Well, I kept thinking about you,

206
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:13,487
but I didn't realize who you were till I
picked up an old magazine this morning.

207
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,032
<i>- What</i> do you mean?
- You were Miss Steinbach Beer last year.

208
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,660
Why, yes, I believe I was.

209
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:23,038
<i>And isn't that you jumping around in
a girdle in all those ads in magazines?</i>

210
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,708
I wouldn't exactly call it "jumping around."
I'm supposed to be dancing.

211
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:30,295
Reason I called, I was wondering if you
wouldn't have dinner with me some night.

212
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,549
Whatever night you say.
What about tonight?

213
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,677
- I'm afraid I can't tonight.
<i>- Tomorrow night?</i>

214
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,264
<i>- I'm sorry.
- What about Thursday night?</i>

215
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,935
Mr. Brookman, you're wasting your time
on this number. Don't call it again.

216
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,534
Hey, kid!

217
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,870
- Pola?
- Yes?

218
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,251
Do you think we'll ever be able
to get this job off the ground?

219
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,420
- What do you mean?
- Here we are nearly three months,

220
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,715
and we can't even get ourselves
engaged, much less married.

221
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,719
- I could have got engaged last week.
- To?

222
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,221
- That English fellow.
- What English fellow?

223
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,892
You know, that tall one that
borrowed five dollars from me.

224
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,520
That's what I mean. Here we are
set up strictly for the carriage train,

225
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,815
and what do we get, you hook a schnook
who takes you for a fin,

226
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,401
I get an invitation
to Hamburger Heaven for dinner,

227
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,946
and Loco shows up every evening with
a gentleman she's met in the drugstore,

228
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,408
with five more shower caps
and three quarts of aspirin tablets.

229
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,661
And where do you think
that's gonna get us?

230
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:48,498
I don't think it's us.
I think it's the men these days.

231
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:52,544
They're getting more and more nervous,
especially the loaded ones.

232
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,464
Meanwhile, where are
we gonna sit next week?

233
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,091
Well, we're both trying, you know.

234
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,636
It isn't always easy
to find out right away

235
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,096
how much they're worth
or if they're married or not.

236
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,891
They look at you like you're
prying into their private affairs.

237
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:09,770
Something's got to break soon,
or we're gonna be out on the sidewalk.

238
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,648
And all we need, you know,
is just one.

239
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,108
That's the beautiful thing
about a bear trap.

240
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,611
You don't have to catch
a whole herd of them,

241
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:21,031
all you need is
one nice, big, fat one.

242
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:27,037
Probably Miss Perth Amboy again
with another load of dollar-day Kleenex.

243
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,378
Thanks.

244
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,463
- Oh, hello, Schatze.
- Hello.

245
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,466
This is... I'm sorry.
What did you say your name was?

246
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,718
- Hanley. J.D. Hanley.
- Of course.

247
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,304
This is Schatze Page,
and this is Pola Debevoise.

248
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,306
- How do you do?
- How do you do, ladies?

249
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,559
I met Mr. Hanley
in the mink department at Bergdorf's.

250
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,229
- Really?
- Yes, the clerk was nice enough to...

251
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,231
You'll have to excuse
the state of this apartment.

252
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,233
We've just sent everything out
to be cleaned.

253
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,986
But if you don't mind
coming into the dining room.

254
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,113
Oh, of course not.

255
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,162
And with the maid off today,
we're roughing it, you might say.

256
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:12,207
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you very much, but I can't stay.

257
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,960
I just came along to help
Miss Dempsey with her bundle.

258
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,713
Mr. Hanley's from Dallas, Texas.

259
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:21,091
Oh, really?
In the oil business?

260
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,552
Oh, a little oil, but mostly stock.

261
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:26,847
- Stocks and bonds?
- No, none of that sort of thing for me.

262
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,516
My stock is
white-faced Hereford, polled.

263
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,518
- Come again?
- Cattle.

264
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,396
- You know, like cows.
- Oh, I see.

265
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,232
Are you sure you won't sit down
for just a little while?

266
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:41,486
Oh, I haven't time right now. But what
I was talking to Miss Dempsey about,

267
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,865
there's a little organization that
I'm a member of, the Oil Institute.

268
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,492
Kind of elder statesmen
of the business.

269
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:49,703
We're having a little informal
reception tonight.

270
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,372
If you young ladies would
honor us with your presence,

271
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,708
I'm sure you'd make us
all very happy, indeed.

272
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,877
Do you mean
nothing but oil men?

273
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,338
Well, not exactly.
Probably a few bankers too.

274
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,340
Well, bankers will be all right.

275
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,092
- Don't you think?
- Naturally.

276
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,636
I realize this is a little sudden
and unconventional,

277
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,348
but there will be dancing and
a few drinks and a few laughs perhaps.

278
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,393
- Sounds just creamy to me.
- I like laughs.

279
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,437
- Well, then it's a deal?
- I'd love it.

280
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,024
That's wonderful. I'll pick you up
around 8:30, if that's all right.

281
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,234
Will we meet some of
the other gentlemen too?

282
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:25,238
Oh, all of them. And don't worry,
they're not all old crooks like me.

283
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,699
- What on earth!
- Stop it!

284
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,868
You look just in the prime to me.

285
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:35,582
Thank you, ladies. You've already
made my trip to New York worthwhile.

286
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,709
Bye now.

287
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,724
I think this is it, kids.

288
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,353
A great big room full of nothing
but rich millionaires

289
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,647
and us.

290
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:08,782
This brings us down to 1947.

291
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,409
I think it's a very good idea.
Where should we go?

292
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,620
Well, there's a new place...

293
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,793
Good evening, madame.
Good evening, sir.

294
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,878
- Table for two.
- Certainly, sir.

295
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,172
This way, madame.

296
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,894
- Champagne?
- We might as well.

297
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,483
Oh, a table for two, Philip.

298
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,652
Certainly, madame.
Will you come this way?

299
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,196
- The best, you know.
- Certainly, sir.

300
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,367
The best we have, sir.

301
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:58,165
- A quart of champagne.
- What kind, sir?

302
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,208
- The best you've got.
- Very good, sir.

303
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,087
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Two, please.

304
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,381
This way, please.

305
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,306
- This way, my dear.
- I'm so sorry.

306
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,187
Oh, I am sorry.

307
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,865
Did you say
you were alone here?

308
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,910
Oh, there's quite a party
of us up from Texas.

309
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,954
- All men?
- Oh, some wives too.

310
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,833
You met some of them this evening.
The others went to a show.

311
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,419
You know how the women are
when they get to New York.

312
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,421
I know.

313
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,549
I think Ella has seen five shows
in the last three days.

314
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,552
- I see.
- Ella's my daughter.

315
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,721
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

316
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,849
Is Mrs. Merrill here with you?

317
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:02,062
There is no Mrs. Merrill,
and I live in New York.

318
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,731
Does that clear the situation
a bit for you?

319
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,734
Oh, yes, indeedy, it does.

320
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,736
Are you married?

321
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:15,033
Married? I sometimes think
I'm the most married man in the U.S.A.

322
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:18,787
Do you know how many females were
at my house when I left there tonight?

323
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,331
No. I can't say that I do.

324
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:25,919
Seven, my wife, her sister,
who's divorced.

325
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,964
And I don't blame the guy
for a second.

326
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:32,592
Their mother, who must be 110
if she's a day.

327
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:36,429
An aunt from
North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

328
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,808
And three more whose names
I didn't even catch.

329
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,602
To tell the truth, I...

330
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,105
I never really felt the loneliness
of being a widower

331
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:48,108
until the past few years.

332
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:51,945
At first, there were children,
you know, to keep me company.

333
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:57,284
But they're grown up now.
My son's married. Ella's engaged.

334
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:01,705
I must confess the house is beginning
to seem pretty big and empty.

335
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,707
I can imagine.

336
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,543
I suppose that's why I've done
so much travelling lately.

337
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:10,213
London, south of France,
Scotland and so on.

338
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,215
That's really no good, you know.

339
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,343
Oh, no, I know. No good at all.

340
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,804
Couple of years ago,
I chartered a boat.

341
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,473
Not large, but quite comfortable.

342
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:24,144
Took about six months,
just loafing around the world.

343
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:27,188
But it was no use.

344
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:31,693
I suppose there's really only
one cure for loneliness.

345
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:35,030
- Yes?
- Human companionship.

346
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:39,075
Oh, but you're so right.
You just don't know how right you are.

347
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,662
I'm not accustomed really to going out
publicly with a married man.

348
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,248
And if I'd had a chance
to ask you at the party,

349
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,584
I don't know that I would have
accompanied you here.

350
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,253
Well, this is all quite innocent, isn't it?

351
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:55,300
If it is, it's the first time I ever
ran into it under similar circumstances.

352
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:00,722
Of course, my first impulse was
to go directly to Arabia myself

353
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,058
and take a good look-see
at the situation.

354
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:06,019
I was certain those chaps from Socony
Standard of New Jersey...

355
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,021
would have somebody on the spot.

356
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,232
After all, there's quite
a tidy little sum involved,

357
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,194
two or three hundred million.

358
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:18,948
- I wasn't going to take any chances.
- Well, naturally.

359
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:23,244
Trouble is it looks like I've got a thing
for guys who work in gas stations.

360
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:26,039
I never met one yet
that didn't send me.

361
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,209
This one handled a pump
for Standard Oil.

362
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,711
You don't own that, do you?

363
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:35,548
Oh, no, no. Standard Oil
is one of the interests

364
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:38,635
of a man named,
I believe, Rockefeller.

365
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,637
Is he a friend of yours?

366
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,056
No, no, I'm afraid not.

367
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,227
Oh, well. But as I was saying...

368
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,604
When you live in
a lunatic asylum like that,

369
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,148
you've got to get out of town
every now and then.

370
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,818
- You know what I mean?
- Perfectly.

371
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:59,280
I've got that all fixed now.
I've got me a lodge up in Maine.

372
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,908
I love lodges.

373
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,123
- You do?
- Simply adore them.

374
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:11,334
You mean...

375
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,545
you'd like to see mine?

376
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:18,508
Oh, well, I was speaking
more figuratively than relatively.

377
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:23,972
Because if you would,
I'm going up there Friday afternoon.

378
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,391
Simply adore 'em!

379
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,652
If you wanna know
what kind of a guy I've got...

380
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,658
All I can say is
I'm a very happy woman.

381
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:47,287
Not only is Mr. Hanley a perfect doll,
but he's absolutely unaffiliated.

382
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,664
- You don't think he's a little old?
- Grow up, will you?

383
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,125
Men with that much dough
are never a little old.

384
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,211
Mine's loaded too,
but he's a real yawn.

385
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:58,047
- He doesn't look single to me either.
- He's not.

386
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,217
- What are you wasting time on him for?
- What else have I got?

387
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:04,053
Unless you'd like me to lose him
and join you and your friend.

388
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,848
You do, and I'll break your neck
in front of this restaurant.

389
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:10,143
- Besides, he's invited me to a party.
- Oh, yeah? When?

390
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,145
We're leaving Friday afternoon.

391
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,814
- Leaving for where?
- His lodge in Maine.

392
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,693
- You out of your mind?
- I don't think so. I like lodges.

393
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:21,654
You can't go.
It's a violation of the whole idea.

394
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:25,074
Why is it? I could meet somebody
else up there, couldn't I?

395
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,911
Who are you going to
meet in Maine, Eskimos?

396
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,371
Did you see this fellow I'm with?

397
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,373
- I saw him.
- What's he look like?

398
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:35,793
- Very nice for a one-eyed man.
- Is that all he's got?

399
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:38,004
What do you think
he's got that patch on for?

400
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,673
I didn't know it was a patch. I thought
somebody might have belted him.

401
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,469
Why can't you keep those cheaters on
long enough to see who you're with?

402
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,554
I'm not going to
take a chance like that.

403
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,681
You know what they say
about girls who wear glasses.

404
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,683
Maybe somebody shot him
in the eye.

405
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:54,062
He sounds just wonderful. I was
curious to know what he looked like.

406
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:56,189
- Who is he?
- I don't know that either.

407
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:59,609
But he hasn't mentioned anything
under a million dollars yet.

408
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:04,531
My guy's real class. Never mentions
his wealth, just refers to it.

409
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:07,700
All Mr. Brewster talks about
is what a horrible family he's got.

410
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,786
But I'll say this for him,
we haven't ordered anything yet

411
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,788
under five dollars a portion.

412
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:15,375
If there's anything leftover,
tell the waiter you want it for the dog.

413
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,628
We'd better be getting back
before they cool off.

414
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,966
Where's Maine, anyway?

415
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,765
I'll take that and that
and that and that.

416
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,767
And that and that.

417
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:17,478
And that and that
and that and that.

418
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,606
- And charge it.
- Certainly, Mrs. Hanley.

419
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,752
Next stop Arabia, sir.

420
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,404
- Is he kidding?
- Not at all.

421
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,908
It's an old custom of the East
to make the stranger feel welcome.

422
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,535
You can tell him from me
I think he's simply a doll,

423
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:18,247
and I couldn't be crazier
about these old Eastern customs.

424
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:46,526
Hello, Fashion House?
Is Mr. Antoine in for Mr. Brookman?

425
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,195
Thank you.

426
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,906
Mr. Antoine?

427
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,908
On the phone.

428
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,910
- Tony? Hiya, boy.
<i>- Yes?</i>

429
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,912
<i>- How are you?
- Fine, fine.</i>

430
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,790
How are you fixed for stuff for Florida,
beach stuff and all that?

431
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,710
- You mean ultra?
- I got an aunt I want to get stuff for.

432
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,546
- How old <i>is she?</i>
- About 25. A very young type aunt.

433
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,549
<i>- I'm sure I could accommodate you.
- Could I see it on them?</i>

434
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,844
- Today?
- That's right. That's the idea.

435
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,054
Tony, you know a model
named Schatze?

436
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,306
- Who?
- Schatze.

437
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,976
<i>- Oh, Mrs. Page.
- That's the one.</i>

438
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:27,442
- Oh, nice joint you got here, Tony.
- Thank you, sir.

439
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,236
- Please sit here.
- If you'll excuse me.

440
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:32,822
Your aunt,
is she blond or brunette?

441
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,782
It depends entirely
on the weather.

442
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,578
The way I'm going to handle it,
I'm not going to stall with Mr. Hanley.

443
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,663
What are you going to do,
mother him?

444
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:43,374
No, that's all right for kids,
but I don't think a mother

445
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,586
is exactly what Mr. Hanley
has in mind.

446
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:51,048
Our first we call
"Rainbow Over the Everglades."

447
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,264
It's a pastel plaid, silk organza
day dress with a voluminous skirt

448
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:01,934
for cocktail parties
and afternoon gatherings.

449
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:13,362
You know, of course,
that diamonds are a girl's best friend.

450
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:16,616
And this is our proof of it.

451
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,471
You're not really thinking of going
away with that chowderhead, are you?

452
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:40,598
Oh, for heaven's sake, no!

453
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:43,893
- You're on, Loke.
- Oh, goodness!

454
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:47,021
This one we call
"Looky, Looky, LookyP"

455
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:53,069
It begins as
a spectator's sports dress.

456
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:57,031
- Well, get you.
- Hi.

457
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,617
Which converts into
a one-piece play costume

458
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,829
of Jersey
and checked-matching wool.

459
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,636
Our next we call
"Good Afternoon, Sweetheart."

460
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,975
This is an afternoon tea dress, which
plunges in the back rather than the front.

461
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:28,396
Made of imported printed sheer,
with parasol to match.

462
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:44,829
<i>You like that, monsieur?</i>

463
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,706
<i>Comme ci, comme ça.</i>

464
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,959
That guy's really
the end of the line.

465
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,003
I still think he's kinda cute.

466
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:54,589
- Who is he?
- That garage man.

467
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:58,175
- What garage?
- That fella I got with the cold cuts.

468
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:03,389
"Trouble in the Afternoon." A beach
boy's shirt of pink and white gingham,

469
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,516
with a deep rose crushed cummerbund.

470
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,145
And a coolie hat of natural straw.

471
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:16,444
"Hard-Hearted Hannah"
is a Palm Beach stroller

472
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:19,530
consisting of
mustard crash pants

473
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:23,367
and a shirttail blouse
of grey and white silk.

474
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,874
Next we have
"Double Frozen Daiquiris."

475
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:33,044
A beach costume of sleek
blue pants of fine wool,

476
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,755
with a wrap around of Thai silk.

477
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,051
You will notice the Egyptian influence
in the bizarre raffia hat.

478
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:46,515
"South of the Border" is Mexican crepe
of black cotton twill,

479
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,395
a tamale-colored serape
and a peon straw hat.

480
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,613
Could I take another look
at that pink-and-blue job?

481
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:02,990
But of course, sir. Miss Schatze.

482
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,604
- Much obliged, Tony.
- Not at all, sir.

483
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,652
Did you see anything
I could put aside for you?

484
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,863
Nope. I don't see anything here
that I want. Thanks again, Tony.

485
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:45,658
All right, girls. Thank you.

486
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,663
- Mr. Antoine?
- Yes?

487
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,915
- I know that guy. He's a screw pot.
- A screw pot?

488
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:55,001
- He's making a chump out of you.
- Miss Schatze.

489
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:57,420
- Yes?
- Do I tell you how to put on a girdle?

490
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,422
You bet your sweet life you don't.

491
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:03,259
Then, would you be good enough
not to tell me how to run my business?

492
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:06,405
- Mr. Brewster?
- Yes.

493
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,491
I'll take these.

494
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:15,790
Aboard!

495
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,440
You're not the regular
driver, are you?

496
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:43,692
No, sir.
Pa's the regular driver.

497
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:48,197
But he went to a Republican rally last
night and didn't get up this morning.

498
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,658
It certainly is
a funny place for it.

499
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,160
Funny place for what?

500
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,371
A convention.

501
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:17,476
- What's this?
- The lodge, naturally.

502
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,687
This house?

503
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:35,077
It'll look better
when I get a fire going.

504
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,538
- But where are the others?
- Other what?

505
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,832
- Members.
- I'm sorry, Miss Dempsey.

506
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,711
I don't know what you're talking
about half the time. What members?

507
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:46,630
- You said it was a lodge, didn't you?
- I did and it is.

508
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:49,717
Then, where are the members.
Like the Elks Lodge.

509
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,804
Mother and I went to an Elks Lodge
convention in Philadelphia,

510
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:55,848
and there were thousands
of members there.

511
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,975
It was one of the happiest
times of our life.

512
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,394
Is that what you really
thought this was?

513
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,188
Well, naturally. What else?

514
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:04,356
- Where do you want these?
- Back in the car.

515
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,358
What's the matter?
Something wrong?

516
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,861
No, just going back
to New York, that's all.

517
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:12,031
Well, not today, you're not.
No more trains till tomorrow.

518
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:15,367
Oh, I may slit my throat.

519
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:17,369
- Would you like a fire?
- I was about to...

520
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:18,787
That's all right. I'll do it.

521
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:20,831
Never saw so much snow
in my life.

522
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:23,709
I'm sorry about all this.
If you'll just be patient,

523
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:27,129
I'll try to get you out of here
as soon as I possibly can.

524
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:31,050
I figured I might have to put on some
of those skis, but not in all this snow.

525
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:34,887
I'll tell you what. I have
some old Medford rum in the pantry.

526
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,225
I'll get a drink for you. And meanwhile,
maybe you'd like a little music.

527
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:42,436
Meanwhile, maybe I'd like
a little poison too.

528
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,111
You got radio
all the way up here?

529
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,489
Oh, sure.
Radio and houses, everything.

530
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:56,158
Here. Maybe you'd better
take the first one straight.

531
00:42:56,242 --> 00:43:01,664
Just listen to that music, all the way
from New York. Good ol' Harry James.

532
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,208
Is it really? How can you tell?

533
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:08,087
Oh, I can tell it's Harry James
because it is Harry James.

534
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,632
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you are listening
to the music of Ziggy Colombo,</i>

535
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:14,927
<i>- coming to you from the...
- Turn that liar off.</i>

536
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,764
Why don't you stop acting like
a spoiled brat and behave yourself?

537
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:21,433
I've never been mixed up
in a situation like this before.

538
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:24,561
As long as I'm in my right mind,
I never will again.

539
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:28,774
But it's not doing either of us any good
to stand here and jaw at each other.

540
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:31,777
I feel awful. All tingly.

541
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,239
Well, I wish I did.
Drink it. Drink it.

542
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:39,159
Is this rum?

543
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:41,453
Medford Rum.
It's over 100 years old.

544
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:45,791
Then I'm sick. I've got a fever.
Call a doctor immediately.

545
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,460
- What are you talking about?
- I've got a fever, I tell you.

546
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:51,297
Whenever rum smells like a carnation,
I've got a fever.

547
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,299
We've got to get
a doctor right away.

548
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,384
- There's no reason to get hysterical.
- Don't you hit me!

549
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:58,012
I'm not going to hit you.
I want to feel your forehead.

550
00:43:58,095 --> 00:44:00,931
- There's a thermometer outside the door.
- Get it! Get it!

551
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:03,809
Will you please call a doctor?
I know when I've got a fever.

552
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:05,811
You do feel a little warm.

553
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:08,147
Are you going to call
a doctor or not?

554
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,567
I can't call a doctor. Everybody knows
me here. Don't you understand?

555
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,947
What am I supposed to do, die because
you got a big name around here?

556
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:20,659
- It's a little large, but...
- Is there a hospital around here?

557
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:22,703
- Open your mouth.
- What's that?

558
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,414
- I want to take your temperature.
- Not with that flute.

559
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,750
It's not a flute,
it's a thermometer. Look.

560
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,252
That's not for people,
it's for blizzards.

561
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:33,088
Open your mouth, I tell you.

562
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:35,924
And don't you try to talk
until I take that out.

563
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:45,392
If it was my daughter,
you know what I'd do?

564
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:48,854
Well, she's not your daughter.
She's not my daughter either,

565
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:51,315
if that's what you're driving at.

566
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:55,319
- How much is it?
- One hundred and two.

567
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:59,656
- Is that bad?
- It's definitely a slight temperature.

568
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,034
Maybe you call it slight
in the city of New York,

569
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:04,036
but in Maine,
she oughta be in bed.

570
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,497
I'm gonna die. I know it.

571
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,791
I'm gonna die out here
in this jungle!

572
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:11,085
If you want, I'll call Ma.
She's a practical nurse.

573
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:13,420
- Oh, what good will that do?
- We can tell her the symptoms.

574
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:16,215
She'll give us the answers.

575
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:19,426
All right. But be very careful
what you tell her.

576
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,595
I'll tell her what you
tell me to tell her.

577
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,644
Hazel? Eben.

578
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:30,896
Ring Ma, will ya?

579
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,065
Brewster's Lodge.
Yeah, he's here with...

580
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,526
His skis.

581
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:38,070
If it's mumps, I'll die.

582
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:41,407
Ma? Say, what's it a sign of
when a girl is shivering and shaking

583
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,034
and has a temperature of 102?

584
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:48,747
- Her eyes watering?
- Like two faucets.

585
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:50,749
They're watering.

586
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,835
Look at her tongue.

587
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:56,338
It looks kind of red.

588
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:58,966
Tongue's blotchy.

589
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,385
Look behind her ears.

590
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:04,721
Have you been
scratching yourself?

591
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:08,183
Of course not.
Models aren't allowed to scratch.

592
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:10,436
Breaking out behind the ears.

593
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:25,284
I see. Okay, thanks, Ma.

594
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:28,829
- You got nothing to worry about.
- What is it?

595
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,415
- Measles.
- Measles!

596
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,417
And I've got nothing
to worry about.

597
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,502
"Get her to bed," Ma says.

598
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:39,465
Keep her quiet and the room dark
so you can avoid complications.

599
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:41,925
She'll be as good as new
in a week or two.

600
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:45,721
Oh!

601
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:03,655
- Keep it.
- Much obliged.

602
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:15,959
Yes, sir.

603
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:19,338
- Hi, Mike.
- Well, for goodness sakes.

604
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:21,673
How are you, Mr. Denmark?
I thought you were in Europe.

605
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:24,801
I was. Come back here.

606
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,723
You're a friend of mine, aren't you?

607
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,850
- You bet your life, sir.
- Yeah, well,

608
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:34,978
I'm in a little jam with the income
tax department, and I need your help.

609
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,189
Anything you want, sir.
I've had a little trouble

610
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,608
with those people myself
from time to time.

611
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,236
- Who's got my apartment now?
- Three young ladies, sir.

612
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,363
- Business women, I believe.
- Yeah, well,

613
00:47:44,446 --> 00:47:46,907
I gotta get in there for a few minutes.
Think you can arrange it?

614
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,660
You can get in there now, sir.
They're both out for the evening.

615
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:52,538
One of them's with a Texas fellow,
and the other's with the one-eyed man

616
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:56,625
- How about the other one?
- Oh, she's away at an Elks convention.

617
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,838
- You want me to wait here?
- Yeah, if you can.

618
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:04,716
If I get a buzz, I'll come back.

619
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,927
That's not them.
They never get in till 2:00 or 3:00.

620
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,304
- I'll be right back.
- Okay if I turn on the lights?

621
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:11,390
Sure.

622
00:49:02,232 --> 00:49:04,484
Pola must have left the lights on.

623
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:08,030
- What will you have to drink?
- Milk, if you don't mind.

624
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:12,159
Milk? Well, if we've got any.

625
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:15,704
Go to the kitchen, will you?
I'll be there in a minute.

626
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:18,600
Is that the best we've got?

627
00:50:18,684 --> 00:50:22,020
Apparently, but it's all I want.

628
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:26,191
Schatze, you've made my visit
a very pleasant one.

629
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:29,444
I'd like to do something
to show my appreciation.

630
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:31,446
Oh, don't be silly, J.D.

631
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:35,659
Tell me something. Is this furniture
really out to be cleaned,

632
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:38,453
or is there
some other explanation?

633
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:40,706
You don't have to
worry about that.

634
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:44,418
Did you sell it or hock it?

635
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:47,045
Well, we sold it.

636
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:49,798
Will they sell it back?

637
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:59,307
And now, dear Schatze,

638
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:01,727
I'm afraid
we must say good-bye.

639
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:05,397
Good-bye? But I thought
you were staying until next week.

640
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,235
I was, but something has happened
that I would never have dreamed of.

641
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,905
And I think the wisest thing I can do
is to get out of here at once.

642
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:16,575
What do you mean?

643
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:19,703
Do you remember the first time I came
into this apartment with Loco?

644
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,246
Yes.

645
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,332
I came in here a subtle and aging widower,

646
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:27,586
with a pattern of my life all laid out
for the rest of my days.

647
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:32,257
- Really?
- That isn't the way I went out of here.

648
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,509
You didn't?

649
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:37,012
Tell me, do you believe
in love at first sight?

650
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:41,099
Oh, absolutely, J.D.
No question in the world about it.

651
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,935
Well, I don't.
Not at my age, anyway.

652
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:47,856
Stop talking about your age. You'd
think you were as old as Methuselah.

653
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:51,359
Don't you know you're right
in the very prime of life?

654
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:53,862
How old are you?

655
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:56,198
Forty.

656
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:59,910
Oh, Schatze, Schatze.

657
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:03,413
That's probably the sweetest lie
you've ever told.

658
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:05,832
Twenty-five would be
a little more like it, wouldn't it?

659
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:09,127
But look here, J.D. You don't want
to go jumping to conclusions, do you?

660
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:13,590
Look, it's no use, darling.
I'm 56 years old.

661
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,967
Thirty years older than you.

662
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:18,011
By your standards, anyway,
an old man.

663
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:20,931
- Oh, no.
- We might support this difference

664
00:52:21,014 --> 00:52:24,768
for another
four to five years perhaps,

665
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,145
but what happens
when I'm truly old?

666
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:30,273
But listen, J.D.
I hate young men.

667
00:52:44,496 --> 00:52:48,375
- Thank you very much.
- That's all right.

668
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:51,503
- Have you got to go already?
- I'm afraid so.

669
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,922
- Well, nighty-night.
- Good night.

670
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:59,761
I've always liked older men.

671
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:01,888
Look at Roosevelt.
Look at Churchill.

672
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:04,224
Look at that old fellow
what's-his-name in African Queen.

673
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:06,309
Absolutely crazy about him.

674
00:53:06,393 --> 00:53:09,437
- So, you see, J.D...
- Pardon me.

675
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:13,149
- Hello. Come in.
- Hope I'm not intruding.

676
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,068
You're entitled to such
a hope, I believe.

677
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:18,947
Don't let her kid you, Pola.
I've got to be going, anyway.

678
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,450
- So early?
- Yes, I'm flying home tomorrow morning.

679
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,703
- Oh, no.
- I've got to.

680
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:28,081
Good-bye, my dear. It's been
a great pleasure knowing all you girls.

681
00:53:28,164 --> 00:53:30,166
Good-bye, J.D.
Come back, will you?

682
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,544
I will. Someday, perhaps.

683
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:35,171
Good-bye.

684
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,173
What time
does your plane leave?

685
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,884
9200.

686
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:43,013
Don't you believe
anything I say at all?

687
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:48,351
I believe that nothing could have been
more wonderful for me than marrying you.

688
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:51,396
And nothing worse for you.

689
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:55,400
- Will you call me before you go?
- That's too early for you.

690
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,694
Very well.

691
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:02,490
Good night, darling.

692
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:11,416
What's the matter?

693
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:14,336
I oughta punch you
right smack in the nose.

694
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:16,546
- What did I do?
- Nothing.

695
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,424
Nothing but break up a play
at the two-yard line, that's all.

696
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,927
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Schatze.
Really I am.

697
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,721
Little Miss Bubblehead
is terribly, terribly sorry, indeed.

698
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,806
I was just so anxious
to tell you the news.

699
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,393
- What news?
- We're going to be married.

700
00:54:30,477 --> 00:54:33,438
- You and who?
- Me and Stewart.

701
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:35,440
You mean Blinky?

702
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:37,943
Yes. And if he doesn't have to
fly to London this weekend,

703
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:40,904
he's going to take me down
to meet his mother this Saturday.

704
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:43,448
- Down where?
- Atlantic City.

705
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:47,494
Oh. What did you say
this guy did?

706
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:51,623
Oil, darling.
Simply barrels of it.

707
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:53,792
- Says he?
- But of course.

708
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:56,544
You ought to hear him
talk about it, really.

709
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:59,047
I think we oughta put
a check on that one.

710
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,299
Why? I don't know
what you mean.

711
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:04,135
Nobody's mother lives
in Atlantic City on Saturday.

712
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:10,642
<i>- Hello?
- Miss Page?</i>

713
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:12,894
That's right, it's still no.

714
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:35,083
Oh! Oh!

715
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:54,894
Oh!

716
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,896
Now who on earth
ever thought of this?

717
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,232
- Thought of what?
- Skiing on snow.

718
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,234
What else would you ski on?

719
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:03,862
Why, the natural way,
like in Florida, on water.

720
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:06,406
Ski on water? Why you.

721
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,450
Oh, no!

722
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:25,341
Mrs. Salem!

723
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,761
Here she is now.

724
00:56:27,844 --> 00:56:31,264
How are you feeling?

725
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:33,433
Never mind how I feel.
Where have you been?

726
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:35,477
- Sitting on the mountain.
- Who with?

727
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,479
Nobody.

728
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:40,023
- What's that?
- I'm going to give you a manicure.

729
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,234
- What was his name?
- Eben.

730
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:46,905
You gotta be careful. You don't want to
get mixed up with a fellow like that.

731
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:48,907
- Don't I?
- Never.

732
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,909
Who do you think I oughta
get mixed up with?

733
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:54,120
Well, I won't always
have measles, you know.

734
00:56:54,204 --> 00:56:56,790
Say, you are getting better.

735
00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:59,209
You just wait till
we get back to New York.

736
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:02,128
- I don't dig you sometimes.
- What do you mean?

737
00:57:02,212 --> 00:57:04,339
- Is your wife a spook?
- Of course not.

738
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:07,092
She's a very wonderful woman
and a true credit to her sex.

739
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:10,178
- Oh, brother!
- I mean it.

740
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,806
- Then, Why'd you flip like this?
- Pardon?

741
00:57:12,889 --> 00:57:14,808
What set you off that night?

742
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:16,935
Oh! Well, for one thing,

743
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:20,396
- you're a very beautiful young woman.
- I know.

744
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,941
And for another,
I was a little upset that evening.

745
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:25,610
My daughter had just
run away and got married.

746
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:27,862
Well, for goodness sakes,
what's wrong with that?

747
00:57:27,946 --> 00:57:31,116
What was wrong with that
was the fella's no good. He's a gigolo.

748
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:33,493
Oh, really? Maybe I know him.
What's his name?

749
00:57:33,576 --> 00:57:35,870
- His name's Martinez.
- I read about that.

750
00:57:35,954 --> 00:57:38,248
He's a dancer.
"Hoofer Weds Heiress."

751
00:57:38,331 --> 00:57:40,250
Well, she isn't one any more.

752
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,377
- What do you mean?
- I disinherited her.

753
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,379
Disinherited her?

754
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,464
Well, there's one thing
I'll say for poor people,

755
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:48,508
they don't go around
disinheriting their children.

756
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:51,469
Obviously. They've got nothing
to disinherit them with.

757
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,471
Say that again.

758
00:57:53,555 --> 00:57:57,517
Poor families don't have any money to
pass on from one generation to another.

759
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,644
It doesn't make any difference.

760
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:05,233
My mother, no matter how much money she
didn't have, she wouldn't disinherit me.

761
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:08,111
Do you mind if we just
don't talk for a while?

762
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:10,071
Not at all. I like not to talk.

763
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:00,246
This is what
I wanted you to see.

764
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,248
It's nice.

765
00:59:02,332 --> 00:59:05,543
It's all mine from the crest
of that second ridge to the north there,

766
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:08,504
all the way around
as far as the eye can see to the west

767
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:11,382
and back around that way
to just beyond old Baldy.

768
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:14,385
- All yours?
- Yep.

769
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:18,473
You mean all those trees
and mountains and everything?

770
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:20,475
That's it.

771
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,477
Well, for crying out loud.

772
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,479
Isn't it beautiful?

773
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:26,564
Isn't that what they call "timber"?

774
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:28,566
Best in the world.

775
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,486
Well, what do you know
about that?

776
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:34,530
I think it's the most beautiful sight
in the whole world.

777
00:59:34,614 --> 00:59:37,283
Well, I certainly
don't blame you.

778
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:40,787
Pure and as clean
and plenty of room.

779
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:44,999
Do you think
you could ever come to like it?

780
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:48,336
Well, I never thought
about it before,

781
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:50,588
but I imagine I could.

782
00:59:50,672 --> 00:59:54,467
You should see it at night, with the
moon and the stars over that mountain.

783
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,763
Look, show me again
how much is yours.

784
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:01,641
Well, from the crest of
that second ridge to the north there,

785
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:03,643
all the way around to the west.

786
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:26,165
It's all right this time.
One went to work,

787
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:29,460
one went to look at a bank and
the other one is still with the Elks.

788
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:31,713
If I remember correctly,
that's what you said the other night.

789
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:34,382
I know, but this time I'm positive.

790
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:18,468
[Phone Rings 1

791
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:46,704
Hello?

792
01:01:46,788 --> 01:01:49,207
Oh, hello.

793
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:51,751
- Hello.
- Just a moment.

794
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:54,003
- She's not back yet.
- She isn't?

795
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:56,881
- You wanna wait?
- No thanks. I'd better be going.

796
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:59,926
- I'll tell her you were here.
- Thank you.

797
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:01,969
- Bye now.
- Bye.

798
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:08,684
Sorry, darling. Just one of Schatze's
friends just popped in to say hello.

799
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:11,521
- I'll tell you what I want you to do.
<i>- Yes?</i>

800
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:14,690
It seems that I've got to nip down
to Washington this evening for dinner

801
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:17,276
with a certain party
whose name I'll tell you later.

802
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,696
But that means I'll probably
have to stay there overnight.

803
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:24,158
<i>So, I'm going to ask you to take
the plane down to Atlantic City alone,</i>

804
01:02:24,242 --> 01:02:27,703
<i>and I'll be over from Washington
in time to meet you at the airport.</i>

805
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:30,498
<i>- Is that all right?
- Of course it is, darling.</i>

806
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:33,251
Then, here's a schedule
I suggest

807
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:37,797
There's a flight from Atlantic City
from La Guardia Airport at 5:00 P.M.

808
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:19,464
Fasten your seat belts, please.

809
01:03:19,547 --> 01:03:21,466
May I take these, please?

810
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,885
Well, everything's okay.

811
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:12,183
Well, I'll be darned.

812
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,185
Pardon?

813
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:16,187
Haven't we met before?

814
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:19,482
For goodness sakes, you're that friend
of Schatze's. What happened to you?

815
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:21,484
- When?
- Yesterday.

816
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:24,195
I told Schatze you were coming back,
and she waited for you.

817
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,197
I got tied up.

818
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,324
- Your wife?
- Oh, I'm not married.

819
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:30,326
That's nice.

820
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:55,393
- Look.
- Yes?

821
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:57,520
Didn't you bring your glasses?

822
01:04:57,603 --> 01:05:00,147
What glasses?

823
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:02,149
Don't you wear glasses?

824
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:06,612
Oh, no. Whatever gives you that idea?

825
01:05:06,696 --> 01:05:09,532
You got the most peculiar
vision I ever saw.

826
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:13,160
- Why do you say that?
- You're reading that book upside down.

827
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:15,162
But I'm no such thing.

828
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:17,164
Not you, the book.

829
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:22,420
Oh.

830
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:24,422
Isn't it silly, though?

831
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:26,424
What is it, astigmatism?

832
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,884
- No, just blind as a bat.
- Me too.

833
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:30,928
Oh, really?

834
01:05:31,012 --> 01:05:33,514
Then, why aren't you
wearing glasses?

835
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,851
I am wearing glasses.

836
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:43,941
Well, there you are.

837
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:47,486
I used to be like that. For years,
I went around banging into fireplugs

838
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:51,741
and shaking hands with lampposts because
I didn't want to be called four eyes.

839
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:55,161
And then, something happened which
cured me of that sort of thing forever.

840
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:57,246
What was that?

841
01:05:57,330 --> 01:06:00,875
One evening, I said hello to three
different fellows I owed money to.

842
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:06,172
But it's different with girls,
don't you think?

843
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:08,174
How is it?

844
01:06:08,257 --> 01:06:12,511
Well, you know what they say
about girls who wear glasses.

845
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:14,722
What are you talking about?

846
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:17,642
Men aren't attentive
to girls who wear glasses.

847
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:19,644
Did you ever try it?

848
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,646
No.

849
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:24,815
- You brought them with you, didn't you?
- Yes.

850
01:06:24,899 --> 01:06:28,152
Then, why don't you put them on?
Find out for yourself.

851
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:29,654
With you?

852
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:31,238
Why not?

853
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:35,409
Well.

854
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:42,291
If you're worried about me, I'll tell
you right now before you put them on,

855
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:45,044
I already think
you're quite a strudel.

856
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:47,088
- Honestly?
- Absolutely.

857
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:50,508
I've thought so
from the first minute I saw you.

858
01:06:51,384 --> 01:06:55,471
Well, if you really think so.

859
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,185
Go ahead. Put them on.

860
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:08,234
- You're crazy.
- No?

861
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:10,903
- You look better with them on.
- I do?

862
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:14,156
Gives your face a certain mystery.

863
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,158
No kidding.

864
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:19,120
And distinction.
A certain kind of distinction.

865
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:21,789
Well, what do you know
about that?

866
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:24,583
You're already a very good-looking girl,
if you don't mind my saying so.

867
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:26,585
- No, not at all.
- And the glasses.

868
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:29,380
That particular type gives your face
a very interesting,

869
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:31,382
difference.

870
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,720
You don't think they make me
look like an old maid.

871
01:07:35,803 --> 01:07:40,474
I've never seen anybody in my whole life
who reminded me less of an old maid.

872
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,859
What's your name?

873
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:00,202
So what happened was this.

874
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:02,413
I sent this check to this fellow,
this tax expert.

875
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:06,625
Instead of paying the tax, he cashed the
check and put the money in his pocket.

876
01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:08,669
But why didn't you tell that
to the government?

877
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:10,671
Well, I did, but you know
how the government is.

878
01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:13,257
Couldn't be more sympathetic,
but they still wanted the dough.

879
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,926
Even after you told them
that fellow was a crook?

880
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:20,014
What did that mean? As far as they
were concerned, the only crook was me.

881
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,892
I had to have some proof. That's why
I had to get back and get this check.

882
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:25,227
Well, how do you like that?

883
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:28,105
When I found out he'd gone
to Kansas City, I jumped on a plane.

884
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:31,442
He's either going to kick in with the
money, or I'm going to break his neck.

885
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:33,486
Is that where he is, Kansas City?

886
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:36,405
So I understand.

887
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:38,949
Why are you going
to Atlantic City?

888
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:43,204
Who's going to Atlantic City?

889
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:46,582
Doesn't this plane
go to Atlantic City?

890
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:50,544
What are you talking about?
This is the Midland Sky Chief.

891
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:52,713
- Are you kidding?
- Of course not.

892
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:55,633
We should be in Kansas City
in about 20 minutes.

893
01:08:55,716 --> 01:08:57,718
Why?

894
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:00,971
Oh, nothing.

895
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,974
Just one of those things.

896
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:08,562
Go on. Tell me some more.

897
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,606
Tell me anything.

898
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:43,222
Does your family
live there with you?

899
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:44,515
Oh, no, they couldn't do that.

900
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:47,685
I see. You mean they have
a place of their own.

901
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:49,979
Oh, sure, over at Dexter Mills.

902
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:52,356
I saw a picture
in Harper's Bazaar once,

903
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,400
what they call
a mountain shack.

904
01:09:54,483 --> 01:09:56,443
It was creamy.

905
01:10:03,784 --> 01:10:06,120
Well, here we are.

906
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:09,874
- Here we are where?
- The shack. This is it.

907
01:10:09,957 --> 01:10:12,126
Well, what do you mean?
This is a shack.

908
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,128
Well, of course.
What did I tell you?

909
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,130
It's very comfortable inside.
Come on.

910
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:19,425
Just a minute.
Is this really on the level?

911
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:23,512
- Is what on the level?
- Well, is this really your home?

912
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:27,099
Well, it is when I'm on duty.
What did you expect?

913
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:29,560
Well, certainly not this.

914
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:32,563
I don't know what you mean, honey.
It's just a forestry lookout station.

915
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:34,732
But they're all pretty much alike.

916
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:37,610
But if you're so rich, why couldn't
you build yourself a bigger one?

917
01:10:37,693 --> 01:10:41,238
- Like in Harper's Bazaar.
- Rich? Who's rich?

918
01:10:43,032 --> 01:10:45,576
- Aren't you?
- Well, that's a good one.

919
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,579
Where on earth
did you get that idea?

920
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:51,749
But all these trees.
Didn't you say they were yours?

921
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:54,293
Well, mine to watch, sure.
That's part of my job.

922
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:56,921
I don't even own a bush.

923
01:10:57,004 --> 01:11:00,382
Oh. But I thought...

924
01:11:00,466 --> 01:11:02,760
Oh, darling, this is the worst.

925
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:05,554
What's the matter, sweetheart?
I don't get it.

926
01:11:05,638 --> 01:11:08,933
I'm so crazy about you.

927
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:12,811
Well, that's wonderful.
I'm crazy about you too.

928
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:16,357
But I... Oh, honey.

929
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,235
Oh, I see.

930
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,988
What you mean is you're not interested
in a man without trees.

931
01:11:23,072 --> 01:11:25,616
That's not it at all.

932
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,619
I'm crazy about you, but I...

933
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:31,372
Let's not talk about it.
Do you mind?

934
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,415
If only you'd told me.

935
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:35,918
I told you. I told you
the first day we went skiing.

936
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:38,796
I told you then
that's what I was, a ranger.

937
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:42,007
Is that what you meant?

938
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:44,635
What else could I have meant?

939
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:49,223
I'm sorry. I just thought
you meant you came from Texas.

940
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:13,956
What's the matter
with your dad this time?

941
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:16,000
He went to another
Republican rally.

942
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:18,002
Maybe he'd better
join the Democrats.

943
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:20,087
Not in Maine. Too lonely.

944
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,190
Can we rent a car in Portland?

945
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:42,359
I suppose so.

946
01:12:42,443 --> 01:12:45,029
You mean we're going to
drive back to New York?

947
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:47,990
It'll probably be pretty expensive,
but I think it's the safest way

948
01:12:48,073 --> 01:12:50,117
not to be seen by anybody.

949
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:03,130
When you got the measles,
I wouldn't have given ten cents

950
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:06,425
for my chances of getting
out of this jam without being caught.

951
01:13:06,508 --> 01:13:08,427
- You know what I did?
- What?

952
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:12,473
I got on long distance with a few
friends around Chicago and St. Louis.

953
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:16,060
I had them keep sending telegrams
to my wife, signed with my name.

954
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:19,313
All about this unexpected
business trip I was on.

955
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:21,356
It worked like a charm.

956
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,317
That sounds very intelligent.

957
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:33,535
I don't like to boast, but if I hadn't
had that little stroke of brilliance,

958
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:36,246
there could have been a lot
of very serious results in my home.

959
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,248
And business too.

960
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:40,417
What are you going to do
to show you're grateful?

961
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:43,087
- What do you mean?
- Whenever a person pulls a rock

962
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,089
and skins out of it,
they oughta do something nice

963
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:46,423
for the injured party,
don't you think?

964
01:13:46,507 --> 01:13:48,425
- For instance?
- Well, for one thing,

965
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:50,928
you ought to drop into Cartier's
tomorrow morning and get your wife

966
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:53,305
some sort of little bubble
for her wrist.

967
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:55,307
How about some nice flowers?

968
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:58,393
Is that all the grateful you are,
five dollars worth of geraniums?

969
01:13:58,477 --> 01:14:01,438
Look, if I gave Mrs. Brewster
a piece of jewelry not on her birthday,

970
01:14:01,522 --> 01:14:05,734
she'd have 25 private detectives
on my tail within 10 minutes.

971
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:09,238
Well, if you'll pardon my frankness,
I'd be ashamed to admit it.

972
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:13,283
- I'll send her a nice box of roses.
- She'll love that.

973
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,285
She's not used to
expensive gifts.

974
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:18,455
Anything more than flowers
would upset her terribly.

975
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:22,084
All right, then. How about doing
something nice for your daughter?

976
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,294
- What?
- Why don't you inherit her again?

977
01:14:24,378 --> 01:14:26,463
I'm sorry, that's quite
out of the question.

978
01:14:26,547 --> 01:14:28,715
But that wouldn't cost you
anything until you were dead.

979
01:14:28,799 --> 01:14:31,301
I'd rather not discuss it
if you don't mind.

980
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:34,138
What's the matter with you, anyway?
Everybody loves their children.

981
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:37,808
Even monkeys. It's a well-known law
of Mother Nature.

982
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:40,978
Mother Nature never
had to deal with a gigolo.

983
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:43,814
And what else pray
were you trying to be?

984
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:47,818
The differences between the two
should be quite obvious, even to you.

985
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:50,487
And would you be so kindly
as to specify how?

986
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:55,075
If you don't mind, I don't think
I care to debate the question with you.

987
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:59,746
Once you get one foot on the ground,
you're really quite a jerk, aren't you?

988
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:09,339
Where are we now?

989
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:11,341
We'll be crossing
the George Washington Bridge...

990
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:14,511
George Washington Bridge?
What are we doing way over there?

991
01:15:14,595 --> 01:15:18,182
On the customary routes,
I could be recognized a dozen times.

992
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:20,350
This side of the river
no one knows me.

993
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:24,980
It's just another example of the use
of intelligence in a situation like this.

994
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:00,557
If you've got intelligence,
you don't need luck.

995
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:04,645
If you've got that good old American
know-how, you don't need anything else.

996
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:08,232
Because the simple truth is
that when the chips are really down,

997
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:10,817
man is still the master
of his own fate.

998
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:14,279
The captain of his destiny.

999
01:16:14,363 --> 01:16:16,573
- What is it?
- Motorcycle cops.

1000
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:24,248
Are you sure
you're not on the lam?

1001
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:34,633
It's all right.
Just keep moving.

1002
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:36,927
I'm awfully sorry
if I'm going too fast.

1003
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,929
You're all right.
Just follow me.

1004
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:03,287
Good afternoon, sir.
This is George Washington Bridge Week.

1005
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:06,456
And the city of New York extends
its heartiest congratulations

1006
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,128
to the happy couple driving the 50
millionth car across our noble edifice.

1007
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:13,130
- Hold it. This way, lady.
- Another smile, lady.

1008
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:15,173
Hold it. Hold it.

1009
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:29,146
I'm sorry I can't give you
any more, Mrs. Page, but...

1010
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:31,398
you know what the market
is these days.

1011
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:34,401
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you again, Mrs. Page.

1012
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,655
[Phone Rings 1

1013
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:43,994
<i>- Hello?
- Miss Page?</i>

1014
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:47,914
Oh, it's you again.

1015
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:55,630
- Are you good for seconds?
- Oh, sure.

1016
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:58,008
- Let's order them now.
- Two more, Mac. Well-done.

1017
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:01,428
And slap a little chili on that one.

1018
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:03,722
- You know what the trouble with you is?
- Which one?

1019
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:07,017
Trouble with you is you're a hamburger
with onions dame and won't admit it.

1020
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,519
I wonder how long it took you
to work that one out.

1021
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:12,647
My guess is that I know you
better than you know yourself.

1022
01:18:12,731 --> 01:18:14,691
Ketchup.

1023
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:18,320
Coleslaw?

1024
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:20,322
If I can get it on here.

1025
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:23,617
I just don't believe that you're the
kind of girl you pretend to be at all.

1026
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,328
I'll say this for you, that's
quite a line you've got there.

1027
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:28,413
Here. Pickles?

1028
01:18:28,497 --> 01:18:30,499
Thanks.

1029
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:34,544
It's all an act. You know as well
as I do that money isn't everything.

1030
01:18:34,628 --> 01:18:36,546
Who told you it wasn't?

1031
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:38,548
Nobody had to.

1032
01:18:38,632 --> 01:18:41,176
Did you ever have any?

1033
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:43,178
A little, yes.

1034
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:45,680
Then, how do you know
it isn't everything?

1035
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:49,309
Do you seriously believe having money
automatically brings you happiness?

1036
01:18:49,393 --> 01:18:51,853
Well, no, but it doesn't
automatically depress me either.

1037
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:53,897
I don't believe you, Schatze.

1038
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,775
Look, Tommy, I'm in a jam here
Don't you understand?

1039
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:59,027
I'm in a very bad
financial situation.

1040
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:01,029
If those kids don't come back,

1041
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:03,240
I'm on the hook for a year's
rent for that apartment.

1042
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:05,242
So, what do you think
I should do now,

1043
01:19:05,325 --> 01:19:07,828
fall in love with a character
who doesn't even own a necktie?

1044
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:10,914
- Haven't they written to you?
- How can they? They're illiterate.

1045
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:13,583
- Listen, honey...
- It's no use, Tommy boy.

1046
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:17,421
Just as soon as I finish this horse
burger, I never want to see you again.

1047
01:19:21,716 --> 01:19:23,635
Hello?

1048
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:25,720
<i>How about taking a look
at Miss Liberty today?</i>

1049
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:27,722
Well.

1050
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:36,773
If you were solvent, it would be
an entirely different matter.

1051
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:40,277
But I had it with a grease monkey
like you, and that's all I want of that.

1052
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:44,739
Okay, Miss Cafe Society, take a look out
there and give me a rest for a moment.

1053
01:19:44,823 --> 01:19:47,784
And the truth of the matter,
I don't care what you say,

1054
01:19:47,868 --> 01:19:50,287
is that if you're not loaded,
you've already got two strikes on you.

1055
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:53,915
I already said okay. What else
do you want me to say about it?

1056
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:58,003
As soon as we get off this barge,
I never want to see you again.

1057
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:03,717
[Phone Rings 1

1058
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:08,680
<i>- Yes?
- Tonight?</i>

1059
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,265
No.

1060
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:16,730
I mean it I tell you.

1061
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:19,566
Just as soon as we get home,
I never want to see...

1062
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,370
I'm sorry we can't give you
any more, Mrs. Page.

1063
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:33,914
I already laughed at that one.

1064
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:36,082
Well, anyway, thanks again.

1065
01:20:46,176 --> 01:20:48,094
May I come in?

1066
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:52,933
May I change my mind?

1067
01:20:53,016 --> 01:20:54,559
Is this on the level?

1068
01:20:54,643 --> 01:20:56,603
From the bottom of my heart.

1069
01:20:57,103 --> 01:20:59,481
Then, hold it
for just one second.

1070
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:05,904
Fred? Fred? This is Mrs. Page.

1071
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:09,157
Grab that furniture man and tell him
to bring that stuff right back up here.

1072
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:11,159
Do you understand?

1073
01:21:12,327 --> 01:21:14,287
Don't even move.

1074
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:37,435
Well?

1075
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,440
Yes.

1076
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:04,546
Is something wrong, Mrs. Page?

1077
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:07,007
I don't know.
I just feel so lonely.

1078
01:22:07,132 --> 01:22:09,593
- Your friends?
- Yeah.

1079
01:22:09,676 --> 01:22:12,220
Not one of those two dingbats
to stand up with me.

1080
01:22:12,304 --> 01:22:14,514
Well, there's still a good hope
they may come yet.

1081
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:16,725
If they come now,
I'll throw them out on their necks.

1082
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:18,727
- But I thought...
- I wanted them yesterday.

1083
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,854
What time have I got
to laugh at them now?

1084
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:24,691
Well, for crying out loud, a party.

1085
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,693
Wait a minute.

1086
01:22:28,069 --> 01:22:31,990
- There's Loco!
- Well, hi!

1087
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:34,701
- What is it?
- Schatze's wedding. Didn't you know?

1088
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:37,579
- Who to?
- Dallas, Texas.

1089
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:43,793
- Pardon me, but my name is Ding Dong.
- How do you do?

1090
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:46,254
- Did you have much trouble?
- What do you mean, trouble?

1091
01:22:46,338 --> 01:22:48,465
He's absolutely insane
about me.

1092
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:51,092
- No kidding.
- Out of his mind.

1093
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:53,136
- Do you know how much he's worth?
- How much?

1094
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:55,138
- Thirty mil.
- He's not.

1095
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:57,140
Give or take a mil.

1096
01:22:57,223 --> 01:22:59,643
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

1097
01:22:59,726 --> 01:23:02,437
Oh, and he's a doll.
A perfect doll.

1098
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,232
- What a break.
- I'm not kidding. It's a dream marriage.

1099
01:23:06,316 --> 01:23:08,777
What about you?
Where have you been all this time?

1100
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:11,154
Oh, I went back to Maine.

1101
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:13,365
What do you mean,
you went back to Maine?

1102
01:23:13,448 --> 01:23:17,661
Well, to tell you the truth,
I got married up there.

1103
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:19,663
Not to that Shriner.

1104
01:23:19,746 --> 01:23:21,998
- Oh, no, he was already married.
- That's what I thought.

1105
01:23:22,082 --> 01:23:24,000
Who'd you marry?

1106
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:27,837
Well, he's not anybody
in particular.

1107
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:30,674
Just a fella I met up there.

1108
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:33,843
But I'm absolutely
crazy about him.

1109
01:23:33,927 --> 01:23:38,515
How do you like that?
Both of us at the same time.

1110
01:23:38,598 --> 01:23:40,517
What does he do?

1111
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,019
- He's a ranger.
- Cattle, you mean?

1112
01:23:43,103 --> 01:23:46,481
No, he's a forest ranger.

1113
01:23:46,564 --> 01:23:50,360
Well, that's not bad. If you get enough
trees, they're really worth something.

1114
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:53,530
- How'd you meet him?
- I don't mean he owns them,

1115
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:55,865
he just watches them.

1116
01:23:55,949 --> 01:23:58,743
You mean, just looks at them?

1117
01:23:58,827 --> 01:24:02,789
He's got a house on top of a mountain.
They keep a lookout for fires

1118
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:04,874
so all those trees
don't burn down.

1119
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:07,502
How can he make any dough
out of that?

1120
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:09,629
He doesn't, much.

1121
01:24:09,713 --> 01:24:11,715
You mean
he's a kind of fireman?

1122
01:24:11,798 --> 01:24:13,591
That's it.

1123
01:24:21,433 --> 01:24:23,560
- Thank you.
- Mr. Hanley?

1124
01:24:23,643 --> 01:24:26,938
- You have the license, I suppose.
- Yes, right here.

1125
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:34,612
Wouldn't you like to meet him?

1126
01:24:34,696 --> 01:24:36,614
Oh, sure. Is he here?

1127
01:24:36,698 --> 01:24:39,409
I'll get him.

1128
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:51,129
Hiya, Schatze.

1129
01:24:51,212 --> 01:24:53,590
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

1130
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:57,969
Congratulations, honey. We read about it
on the plane. I think it's just creamy.

1131
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,971
You know how much he's got?

1132
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:02,474
- How much?
- Fifty mil.

1133
01:25:02,557 --> 01:25:04,476
- Brother!
- Give or take a mil.

1134
01:25:04,559 --> 01:25:06,478
Have you been shopping yet?

1135
01:25:06,561 --> 01:25:10,064
When they open the doors,
I fall in.

1136
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:12,984
- What a break!
- Where have you been?

1137
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:15,445
- Kansas City.
- For what?

1138
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:17,447
That's where Freddie and I
got married.

1139
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:20,283
- You mean you married that crowbar?
- Well, yes.

1140
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,535
Honest to goodness, Pola,
you need a governess.

1141
01:25:22,619 --> 01:25:25,622
I could have pegged that guy as a phony
when I was eight years old.

1142
01:25:25,705 --> 01:25:28,374
Oh, not Stewart.
I married Freddie.

1143
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,460
Freddie? Who he?

1144
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:35,465
Well, it's a little mixed up. You see,
I got on his plane to Kansas City.

1145
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:37,509
I thought you were going
to Atlantic City.

1146
01:25:37,592 --> 01:25:40,386
I was, but the first stop
for this plane was Kansas City.

1147
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:42,806
Never mind. I don't want to
hear any more about it.

1148
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:45,683
Just tell me one thing...
is he holding or not?

1149
01:25:45,809 --> 01:25:47,727
Well, yes and no.

1150
01:25:47,811 --> 01:25:50,188
Oh, no, no, no. Not you too.

1151
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:53,608
I mean, he'd be holding
if he could get his hands on it.

1152
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:56,486
- Say that again.
- Well, he's on the lam.

1153
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:59,656
- A thief?
- No, no, he's not a thief.

1154
01:25:59,739 --> 01:26:02,283
As a matter of fact,
he owns this apartment.

1155
01:26:02,367 --> 01:26:04,661
But he gave this guy a check
for his income tax...

1156
01:26:04,744 --> 01:26:06,663
Then, what's he on the lam for?

1157
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:10,208
Then, he went up to break this
guy's neck, but his glasses fell off.

1158
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,460
- Whose glasses?
- Freddie's.

1159
01:26:12,544 --> 01:26:14,462
And the guy nearly
broke his neck.

1160
01:26:14,546 --> 01:26:17,006
You mean, he's blind too?

1161
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:19,175
Blinder than me.

1162
01:26:21,553 --> 01:26:25,348
Here he is.
This is Schatze, darling.

1163
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:27,350
Oh, congratulations, Mrs. Page.

1164
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:29,853
Thank you. Congratulations to you too.
She's okay.

1165
01:26:29,936 --> 01:26:32,522
- I think so.
- And this is Pola.

1166
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:35,233
- Glad to meet you.
- Holy Toledo!

1167
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:37,777
- Isn't he cute?
- Just a minute.

1168
01:26:40,655 --> 01:26:43,867
Two more pounds
and she could be arrested for bigamy.

1169
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:47,829
Pardon me, Mrs. Page. Mr. Hanley would
like to know if there's a maid of honor.

1170
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:50,665
- If he can find one.
- Can I be it?

1171
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:53,334
Matron, I believe, is about
the best you can hope for.

1172
01:26:53,418 --> 01:26:55,336
- Shall I tell him?
- Take him.

1173
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:57,881
- Come on, before Pola gets here.
- Bye.

1174
01:26:57,964 --> 01:26:59,883
Bye.

1175
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:04,429
It's just Schatze. Come on.

1176
01:27:05,555 --> 01:27:07,974
- Here he is.
- Hi, Mrs. Page.

1177
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:11,102
- Is that going to be permanent?
- No, it's just a brace.

1178
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:13,313
He takes it off at night.

1179
01:27:13,396 --> 01:27:15,565
Don't you worry.
I'm going to get even with him yet.

1180
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:17,859
I just have to lay
a little low for a while.

1181
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:20,445
We're going underground
right after the ceremony.

1182
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:23,448
- You don't mind?
- Love it

1183
01:27:23,531 --> 01:27:26,367
Well, congratulations
to you too.

1184
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:30,413
I think we'd better get started. Some
of the kids are beginning to foam over.

1185
01:27:34,918 --> 01:27:39,380
Okay, tell them to blow the whistle.

1186
01:27:44,761 --> 01:27:46,679
You're still sure?

1187
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:49,432
Of course.

1188
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:24,092
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here..."

1189
01:28:24,175 --> 01:28:27,136
- Please.
- What's the matter, dear?

1190
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:30,640
My ankle. Can you take me back?

1191
01:28:30,723 --> 01:28:32,934
Why, yes. Of course.

1192
01:28:42,694 --> 01:28:45,279
You're just too nice a guy
to get married to someone

1193
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:48,282
that doesn't love you all out.

1194
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:50,284
Was that what it was?

1195
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:54,580
What else?

1196
01:28:54,664 --> 01:28:56,582
I can think of
a number of reasons

1197
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:59,669
why you should never have
considered me in the first place.

1198
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:01,879
Have I hurt you very bad?

1199
01:29:03,214 --> 01:29:05,425
You have.

1200
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:07,677
But I'll recover.

1201
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,846
You sound as though
as you already have.

1202
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:15,018
No. No, that's just one of
the few advantages of age

1203
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:18,271
Disappointments become
a normal part of life.

1204
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,192
But what do you think
I should tell the guests?

1205
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:26,863
Oh, just tell them Mrs. Page
has blown her stack at last.

1206
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:29,198
No one will give you
an argument on it.

1207
01:29:29,282 --> 01:29:31,868
Wouldn't you like to talk it over
first with Loke and Pola?

1208
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:35,288
- Those bubbleheads.
- Why do you say that?

1209
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:38,207
Did you see what those
two goofballs turned up with?

1210
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:40,376
Yeah, I saw
Loke's forest ranger.

1211
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,378
A fireman for trees.

1212
01:29:42,462 --> 01:29:44,380
Seemed like a very nice boy.

1213
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:46,674
- Did you see what Pola brought back?
- No.

1214
01:29:46,758 --> 01:29:49,594
- A fugitive from justice.
- No.

1215
01:29:49,677 --> 01:29:51,637
And a blind one at that.

1216
01:29:55,183 --> 01:29:57,018
Young man?

1217
01:29:57,101 --> 01:30:00,646
As far as I could tell,
in back of that Halloween getup.

1218
01:30:03,316 --> 01:30:06,736
Well, they love them,
don't they?

1219
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:08,988
Drooling, all four of them.

1220
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:13,743
And who is your young man?

1221
01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:17,205
- What young man?
- The one you're in love with.

1222
01:30:17,288 --> 01:30:19,457
Who said I was in love
with a young man?

1223
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,334
I did.

1224
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:24,087
Well,

1225
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:27,757
it's a sin and a shame,
but I guess I've got to admit it.

1226
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,926
I am.

1227
01:30:30,009 --> 01:30:32,970
- Who is he?
- What does that matter?

1228
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:38,101
Well, I don't think it's unnatural
that I should have some curiosity.

1229
01:30:38,184 --> 01:30:41,479
He's nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

1230
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:44,607
A character straight
from Characterville.

1231
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:47,985
- Is that his name?
- Brookman.

1232
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:51,697
- Brookman what?
- Tom Brookman.

1233
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:53,950
You say he's non-holding?

1234
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:56,786
One more hamburger
would break him.

1235
01:30:56,869 --> 01:30:58,621
What does he do?

1236
01:30:58,746 --> 01:31:02,291
He won't say, but that's nothing to me.
I already know.

1237
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:05,086
- What?
- He's a gas pump jockey.

1238
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:08,214
How do you know?

1239
01:31:08,297 --> 01:31:10,842
How do I know how I know?

1240
01:31:10,925 --> 01:31:14,846
There's something about those guys
that I can spot every time I see them.

1241
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:17,765
I married one once, remember?

1242
01:31:17,849 --> 01:31:19,892
Does he really love you?

1243
01:31:19,976 --> 01:31:22,520
To hear him tell it, he does.

1244
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:25,356
Well, what's to stop you
from marrying him?

1245
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:29,861
Nothing now, but it's scarcely
what you'd call progress.

1246
01:31:31,154 --> 01:31:33,823
- He's here now, you know.
- Where?

1247
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:36,242
- Out there.
- How do you know?

1248
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:39,912
Well, there's a character out there
who looks like a gas pump jockey to me.

1249
01:31:39,996 --> 01:31:42,915
- Has he got on a tie?
- No, no tie.

1250
01:31:42,999 --> 01:31:47,420
And at a formal ceremony.
You see what I mean?

1251
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:52,425
Well, you can certainly
say that again.

1252
01:31:52,508 --> 01:31:55,595
And after I told him
I never wanted to see him again, ever.

1253
01:31:55,678 --> 01:31:59,682
Who does he think he is, anyway?
Crashing my wedding.

1254
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:03,019
Well, suppose I ask him?

1255
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:05,813
Now just a minute, J.D.

1256
01:32:16,741 --> 01:32:18,659
Hiya, Tom.

1257
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:22,705
Okay, I guess. Congratulations.

1258
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:25,875
- Congratulations to you.
- Don't be funny.

1259
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:27,919
- Still the character?
- Well, why not?

1260
01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:30,504
All she talks about is dough,
dough, dough. Nothing but dough.

1261
01:32:30,588 --> 01:32:34,383
So, if that's all she wants, you can
have her. I don't want any part of her.

1262
01:32:34,467 --> 01:32:38,387
That's the way she talks, of course,
but that's not the way she feels.

1263
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:41,724
I'll bet. What happened?

1264
01:32:41,807 --> 01:32:45,561
It was a delayed decision
in your favor.

1265
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:48,314
- Are you kidding?
- Not in the least.

1266
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:51,234
- Did you tell her about me?
- Of course not.

1267
01:32:51,317 --> 01:32:54,528
So far as she knows,
you're still hustling a gas pump.

1268
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:56,739
I don't believe this.

1269
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:59,325
- All right. Let's go ask her.
- Wait a minute.

1270
01:33:01,202 --> 01:33:04,247
Wait a minute, J.D.
You think I ought to tell her now?

1271
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,249
Are you crazy?

1272
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:09,669
She obviously likes gas pump jockeys
better than millionaires.

1273
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:12,672
What do you want to do,
disillusion the girl?

1274
01:33:13,673 --> 01:33:15,633
Mr. Brookman, darling.

1275
01:33:19,303 --> 01:33:21,222
- Well, you've got a crust.
- Just a minute.

1276
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:24,100
- A big wedding and you with no necktie.
- Listen to me.

1277
01:33:24,183 --> 01:33:26,978
Everybody else here dressed up in
striped pants and you show up like a...

1278
01:33:27,061 --> 01:33:31,565
- Listen, Schatze!
- I never want to see you again.

1279
01:33:33,526 --> 01:33:36,821
Hey, hey, hey, what about
a cheese dog burger this time?

1280
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:45,621
Following the ceremony, the party
adjourned to a fashionable greasy spoon,

1281
01:33:45,705 --> 01:33:48,666
where perfectly delicious
dog burgers were served.

1282
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:51,669
What happened with those zillionaires
everybody was talking about?

1283
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,671
Oh, what always happens
to rich zillionaires.

1284
01:33:53,754 --> 01:33:57,550
I've got nothing to worry about.
What did you tell me you were worth?

1285
01:33:57,633 --> 01:33:59,885
Oh, I should say
in the neighborhood of 14 dollars,

1286
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:02,263
- give or take a nickel.
- That's all cash too.

1287
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:04,307
How about you, Killer?
How are you fixed?

1288
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:06,976
To tell you the truth,
if I can get my hands on it...

1289
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:09,145
You're fixed but good.
I can tell.

1290
01:34:09,228 --> 01:34:11,647
Wait a minute. I want to hear
from Mr. Fill 'Er Up.

1291
01:34:11,731 --> 01:34:14,400
Just what you estimate
your fortune at?

1292
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:16,652
Oh, about 200 million,
I should imagine.

1293
01:34:16,736 --> 01:34:20,323
Oh, that's not enough.
Might that all be in cash?

1294
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:23,034
I could probably dig up
a couple million cash if I had to.

1295
01:34:23,117 --> 01:34:27,830
Oh, that's wonderful.
What might the rest be in, oil?

1296
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:30,833
Some oil.

1297
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:33,002
- Some airline stock.
- Good.

1298
01:34:33,085 --> 01:34:36,505
A little steel.
Some cattle down in Texas.

1299
01:34:36,589 --> 01:34:40,092
Couple of coal mines in Alabama.
Bit of real estate here and there.

1300
01:34:40,176 --> 01:34:43,346
Some automobile stocks.
The Brookman Building.

1301
01:34:43,429 --> 01:34:45,348
And, of course,
Brookman, Pennsylvania.

1302
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:50,353
A whole city he owns yet. Wouldn't
you know that would happen to me?

1303
01:34:50,436 --> 01:34:52,355
Give me the check, Mac.

1304
01:35:02,365 --> 01:35:04,950
Keep the change, Mac.

1305
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,961
Gentlemen,

1306
01:35:16,045 --> 01:35:18,172
to our wives.

1307
01:35:42,571 --> 01:35:43,572
English - US - SDH
