You surprise me again,

This is becoming
an ugly habit.

I don't have the time right now,

6

On the contrary,
you have lots of time.

7
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,378

8
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:18,890
2 hours and 47 minutes
precisely.

9
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:22,553

those wits of yours.

You'll find an envelope

When you undertake
the trip it suggests,

17
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:42,013
ask yourself
this question--

18
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:45,778
What is 21 out of 42?

19
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:48,848
We're behind.

20
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:51,151
We should abandon
the rest and go.

21
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:53,726
Relax, Targo.
There's not a cop for 20 blocks.

22
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:58,230
He's sending us to the home team dugout
at Yankee Stadium.

23
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:00,732
We supposed to find
something there?

24
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:02,665
What's 21 out of 42?

25
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,669
21 again.
Half of 42.

27
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:08,673

Blackjack.

31
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,177
It's a club.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,181
It's a wild goose chase
is what it is.

1002
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:01,141
He's under us now.
Come back around.

1003
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:02,906
Zeus, what's on your side?

1004
00:54:03,013 --> 00:54:04,913
Look like roaches
in the lights.

1005
00:54:07,017 --> 00:54:09,417
I'll be going
to Nova Scotia.

1006
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,283
You go with the trucks.

1007
00:54:11,388 --> 00:54:13,788
I have something
personal to finish.

1008
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,959
Let's go to work.

1009
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:33,308
That's right, run,
motherfuckers!

1010
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,310
The exterminators
are here!

1011
00:54:35,412 --> 00:54:36,777
Whoo!

1012
00:54:46,924 --> 00:54:48,323
What the fuck?

1013
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:50,416
[ Gunfire ]

1014
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:52,427
We got a chopper behind us!

1015
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:54,190
Got a gun on board?

1016
00:54:54,298 --> 00:54:55,526
What is this?

1017
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:02,267
Hold it still.
I can't see a thing.

1018
00:55:02,372 --> 00:55:03,737
[ Gunshots ]

1019
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,070
[ Gunfire ]

1020
00:55:06,176 --> 00:55:07,575
Oh, shit!

1021
00:55:07,678 --> 00:55:08,906
Oh, shit!

1022
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:11,344
What do you mean,
"Oh, shit" ?

1023
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:15,077
Hang on. Hang on.
We're going down.

1024
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:16,243
Cease fire!

1025
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:18,753
Hey, McClane,
what the fuck?

1026
00:55:20,824 --> 00:55:22,223
Hey, we got smoke!

1027
00:55:22,326 --> 00:55:25,727
We got fucking smoke
and shit flying on me!

1028
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:27,023
[ Horn Honks ]

1029
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,028
Truck! Truck!

1030
00:55:28,131 --> 00:55:29,029
Hold on.

1031
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:37,939
We got to get
out of here!

1032
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,770
They'll start
shooting any second.

1033
00:55:39,876 --> 00:55:40,774
Oh, shit!

1034
00:55:40,877 --> 00:55:42,276
I can't get it off!

1035
00:55:42,379 --> 00:55:44,973
Look out!
Here he comes!

1036
00:55:47,184 --> 00:55:48,583
Can't get out, McClane.

1037
00:55:48,685 --> 00:55:50,084
Get him out of here.

1038
00:55:50,187 --> 00:55:51,415
Where you going?

1039
00:55:51,521 --> 00:55:52,852
I'll get his attention.

1040
00:56:12,009 --> 00:56:13,704
Shit.

1041
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,607
This keeps getting
better and better.

1042
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:22,150
I had no idea

1043
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:24,686
Canada could be
this much fun.

1044
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:31,951
Just give me something
to shoot at.

1045
00:56:32,062 --> 00:56:33,461
Come on, hotshot.

1046
00:56:33,563 --> 00:56:35,861
Show me that smiling face.

1047
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,085
Say hello to your brother.

1048
00:57:01,224 --> 00:57:02,816
Get out of here!

1049
00:57:19,009 --> 00:57:21,307
Yippee-ki-yay,
motherfucker.

1050
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:26,848
Looks like you got
his attention.

1051
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,542
Yeah, looks like it.

1052
00:57:30,454 --> 00:57:32,854
Think we should call
a fire truck?

1053
00:57:32,956 --> 00:57:34,423
Fuck them.
Let him cook.

1054
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,718
Oh, shit!

1055
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:40,353
What?

1056
00:57:40,464 --> 00:57:41,829
What?

1057
00:57:41,932 --> 00:57:44,332
I left Holly
hanging on hold.

1058
00:57:44,434 --> 00:57:45,833
Aw, call her back.

1059
00:57:45,936 --> 00:57:47,335
I don't know.

1060
00:57:47,437 --> 00:57:49,462
She's going to be pissed.

1061
00:57:49,606 --> 00:57:51,198
She'll get over it.

1062
00:57:51,308 --> 00:57:54,038
I don't know, Zeus.

1063
00:57:54,144 --> 00:57:55,543
Like I said,

1064
00:57:55,645 --> 00:57:57,545
she's a very stubborn woman.

1065
00:57:57,647 --> 00:58:00,878
She'd have to be
to stay married to you.

1066
00:58:00,984 --> 00:58:02,884
Ha ha ha!
