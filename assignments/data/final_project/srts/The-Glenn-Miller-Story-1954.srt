00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,364
Hello, Mr Kranz.

3
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,618
- I'd like to redeem my...
- I know! The trombone.

4
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,078
I always keep her
hanging in the window

5
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,582
so when you walk by you can
see she is still there.

6
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,250
I keep my eyes on her.

7
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,670
Say, Mr Miller, where'd you
got the money this time?

8
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:14,175
- Working in a gas station.
- And now you've got another band job?

9
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:18,971
Yep. I'm with Minton at the Sunset
Hotel. Chummy's gonna pick me up.

10
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,642
Your friend Chummy, why
don't he hock something?

11
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,019
- He plays the piano.
- I see!

12
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,441
That's all we need! To schlep a piano
in and out every once in a while.

13
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,028
That string of pearls, how
much did you say that was?

14
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,530
I'd like to give my girl
a birthday present.

15
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,616
Isn't it wonderful to be young?

16
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:43,954
He just got his trombone out of hock
and he wants to buy a $100 necklace.

17
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,790
$100?

18
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,959
I'd like to give her this. Haven't
seen her for a few years.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,921
- You are engaged?
- No, not exactly.

20
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,384
We went around together when we were
in college. University of Colorado.

21
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,428
$100. That's a lot
of money, isn't it?

22
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,682
For a regular customer,
I make a special price.

23
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,012
- (CAR HORN)
- I guess that's Chummy.

24
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,897
A hundred dollars.

25
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,484
Here's for the horn.

26
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,780
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

27
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,745
- Where'd you get this one, Chummy?
- Made a deal on my Briscoe.

28
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,249
She's a beaut. 45 horsepower.
Only four years old.

29
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,171
- 45 horse...
- Come on, hop in. We gotta get goin'.

30
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,215
- Isn't this a darb, kid?
- Yeah, gee whiz!

31
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,427
- You bring my arrangement?
- You're sittin' on it.

32
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,347
But this is the Sunset Hotel,
potted palms and marble stairs.

33
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,267
- Minton's band plays sweet.
- I know that.

34
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:50,062
Don't try to slip in that
arrangement of yours tonight.

35
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,066
- We don't wanna lose this job.
- Stop worryin'. This is a classic.

36
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,528
I Dreamt I Dwelt In Marble
Halls, it's a classic!

37
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:02,951
When Minton hears this arrangement,
he'll give us a job for life. Let's go.

00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,837
Too bad you can't keep the
trombone and hock the arrangement.

41
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,223
- You know where there's Venice?
- Italy.

42
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,810
No! Venice here. By the
pier, with that big wheel.

43
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,271
- Oh, yeah.
- You boys go out there next Monday.

44
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,858
- This fellow Pollack, he has tryouts.
- Ben Pollack?

45
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,529
Ben Pollack. He gets
together a new band.

46
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,781
They go for a long, long trip.

47
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,909
- How do you know?
- A fellow told me this morning.

48
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,787
- You boys go out there.
- Sure. Thanks a lot.

49
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,247
Next Monday?

50
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,833
That gives you a week to
get your trombone out.

51
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,836
- You could work in a gas station.
- Not me.

52
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,004
I'm gonna work on arrangements.

53
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,133
For me, I'm glad for your
business, Mr Miller,

54
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,638
but why don't you give up this
arranging and stick with the trombone?

55
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,850
That's a good question.
I wish I knew the answer.

56
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,812
But I have one idea
up here in my head.

57
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,399
To me, music is more than
just one instrument.

58
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,277
It's a whole orchestra
playing together. See?

59
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:05,281
The only way I can express myself
is to work out an arrangement.

60
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,158
See? Thanks for the tip.

61
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,494

- Thanks, Ben.
- You're in. You're in.

65
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,598
- Who's next?
- I am.

66

I've done some arrangements...

67
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,561
I'm full up on arrangements.
I need more musicians.

68
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,315
I've been working on 'em all week.
They're in your style.

69
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,277
I appreciate that. Lay them on the
piano, I'll try 'em some other time.

70
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,401
Uh-huh.

- Swell.

OK, who's next?

73
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,789
I am. My name's Schwartz.
Wilbur Schwartz.

74

Clarinet, eh? Sit down at the first
chair and blow a little bit.

75
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:45,339
- What tune do you want me to play?
- Do you read at sight?

76
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,794
- Try me.
- Chummy, get him something to read.

77
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,403

Hey, Glenn! Come on back.
Mr Pollack wants to talk to you.

81
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:02,079
He says your arrangement
is a pip! Your arrangement!

82
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,086
I'm playing in the band and
working on arrangements.

83
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,838
I got a two-week advance.

84
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,965
You are a regular Rockefeller!

85
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,595
- I want to thank you for everything.
- Don't mention about it.

I'm only glad it
worked so good out.

About that string of pearls
for my girl's birthday.

88
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:25,314
You said something about a
special price for those.

89
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:30,235
For you it's $80. You pay
me 40 down and $5 a week.

90
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,654
- Good enough.
- Shall I mail it for you?

91
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,783
I better take 'em with me.
I'm not sure of her address.

92
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,203
We're booked into Denver.
She lives right near there.

93
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,414
Ten, 20, 30, 40. There's the 40.

94
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,794
- And here is for the trombone.
- All right.

95
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,380
- Thank you very much.
- Same to you, and good luck.

96

I hope you stay out of
pawnshops for a while.

- So do I! Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

98

- Glenn, come on!
- A Pierce-Arrow?

99
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,068
Yeah! I got it for the
old car and 100 bucks.

100
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,196
Much heavier. It'll hold the
road better on a long trip.

If the band folds up, we can

Well, now, honestly. After
two years and not a word.

The one you wrote a year
ago last Christmas?

Well, I haven't heard
from you either.

I don't even know where you are now.

I'm down here in Denver. I want
to see you. How about tonight?

Oh, I'm sorry. I have a date.

125

Glenn, come on, hurry it up.

128
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,196
I'll see you later, then. Gee,
there's a lot I want to tell you.

- I'll be out right after I finish work. Bye.

- Hi, Dad.
- Going out, Helen?

133
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,681
This is a new wrinkle, isn't it?
Ed keeping you waiting.

134

It isn't Ed tonight. It's a
man I haven't seen for years.

Not Ed? What's happened?

136
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,647
It must be serious for you
to break a date with Ed.

137
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,566
No, Mother. Glenn isn't my type.

138
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,904
I guess I'm just too practical
or unromantic or something.

139
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:07,286
I want a man like Ed who's got a
factory or a store or something solid.

140
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,747
I certainly don't want a wandering
nomad like Glenn Miller.

What's he do, this Glenn Miller?

142
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,754
I don't really know except he said
he was in Denver for overnight.

143
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,965
He's gonna pick me up after work.

144
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,720
He must be a hard worker.
It's nearly 9:00 now.

145
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,514
It is?

00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,809
Well.

Oh! There's really
no excuse for this!

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,655
The least he could've
done was phone.

150
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,366
- Unless he was in an accident.
- Call him.

151
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,493
How can I? I don't
know where he is.

00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,621
If I'm going hunting in the
morning, I've gotta get to bed.

153
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,333
Sam's picking me up
at the crack of dawn.

154
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,086
- Doesn't look as if he's coming tonight.
- It certainly doesn't!

155
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,380
Even if he did come,
I wouldn't see him.

156
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,716
Then we can all go to bed?

157
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:06,678
Well, so much for Mr Glenn Miller.

158
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,973
I'll never see him again.

159
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,823
(GLENN, CALLING SOFTLY) Helen?

160
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,826
Helen?

161
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,280
(WHISTLES)

162
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,041
Helen?

163
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,714
Helen!

164
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,425
(WHISTLES)

165
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,470
Helen! (WHISTLES)

166
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,140
- Oh, there you are.
- Glenn Miller, you go away.

167
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,231
I don't want to go away. I came
to see you. We have a date.

168
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:04,484
- Shh! You'll wake up the neighbourhood.
- How can I talk to you?

169
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,282
You keep quiet. I'll be right down.

170
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,346
Hello, Helen.

171
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,099
What's the matter with
you, coming at this hour?

172
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,103
I told you I'd come out after work.
I got here as quick as I could.

173
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:42,274
- Shh. Be quiet.
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?

174
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:46,069
Just as feisty as ever,
and just as pretty too.

175
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,615
I must be pretty! Wearing this
kimono and my hair up in curlers.

176
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,993
Is that what they are?
Come on, sit down.

177
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,621
- It's cold out here.
- Come on. It's a beautiful night.

178
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,998
Gee.

179
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:02,586
There. I bought you a
present for your birthday.

180
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,465
My birthday? That isn't
until next November.

181
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,760
This is for your last birthday.

182
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,432
Why, they're beautiful! But I
can't accept a present like this.

183
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,894
Why not? They're not real.
I wish they were.

184
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:23,273
I got 'em out in Los Angeles in
a pa... In a, uh... A, uh...

185
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,977
I'll get you some
real ones someday.

186
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,403
Honestly.

187
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,324
Two years and not a word and
then a present like this.

188
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:37,204
You know, with some people you don't
have to write. You just know.

189
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,499
- I knew you'd be here.
- Oh, you did?

190
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,877
Sure. I knew you'd
be just the same.

191
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,047
Just sitting around waiting for
you to show up, I suppose?

192
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,884
"How is my girl?" you said.
Well, you happen to be wrong!

193
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,012
I've been engaged to Ed
Healey for nearly a year.

194
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,557
Did it occur to you that I might
not care if I ever saw you again?

195
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,726
No, it never did.

196
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,770
Never.

197
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,023
- Never.
- Why can't I ever stay mad at you?

198
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,859
You had me worried
there for a minute.

199
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,237
Honestly!

200
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:15,075
If you were anybody else,
I would never speak to you again.

201
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:19,663
Look at me. Sitting here in
this kimono and my hair all...

202
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,583
- Those curlers.
- Terrible, isn't it?

203
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,671
Helen, now look, I've got an idea.

204
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,752
Come with me to Fort Morgan.
I'm gonna introduce you to my folks.

205
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,344
- Now?
- Right now.

206
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,972
People do sleep
between 3am and 6am.

207
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,474
They'll be crazy about you.

208
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,602
- And they'll give us breakfast.
- How do we get there?

209
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,188
- I'll get a taxi.
- A taxi to Fort Morgan?

210
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,566
- Sure.
- That's so extravagant.

211
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,277
- It isn't far.
- Maybe I can get the family car.

212
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,404
Wonderful. Wait a minute.

213
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,858
Let me try these on for size, hm?

214
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,075
There.

216
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,080
Uh-oh.

217
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,666
- Mr Burger, I...
- Take it easy, son.

218
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,837
I'm just going hunting,
for jackrabbits.

219
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,439
- Glenn!
- It's Glenn!

220
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,026
Hi, Herb. How are you?
Glad to see you. Hello, Irene.

221
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,112
- What a surprise! I had no idea.
- Hello, Mother.

222
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,239
Glad to see you. Mother, this is...

223
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,034
You don't need to tell me.
You're Helen!

224
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,661
We've been hearing
about you for years.

225
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,080
Why, yes. I'm very
happy to meet you.

226
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,250
- Daddy'll be down in a minute.
- Dean and Velna?

227
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,086
They're fine! I'll show you
a picture of the baby.

228
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,089
- Sure.
- She your girl, Glenn?

229
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,841
That's right, Herb.

230
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,135
Are you and Glenn
gonna get married?

231
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,513
Don't ask that! We just take
such things for granted.

232
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,682
- How are you, son?
- Fine.

233
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,894
- And you're Helen. Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

234
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,981
- You gonna get these kids some breakfast?
- I certainly am!

235
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,943
You might've let us know where
you are and what your plans are.

236
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,072
We have to ask Helen, eh?
I'll bet he tells you everything.

237
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,492
Oh, no, Mr Miller. I seem to
be the last person he tells.

238
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,286
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.

239
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,455
- You like hotcakes, Helen?
- Yes.

No, it's just as pretty as ever.

- I love that song.
- What, Little Brown Jug?

251
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,622
That's sort of a tin-eared tune.

252
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,208
Why, that's one of my favourites.

253
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,462
My dad used to sing it to me when I
was a little girl. I guess that's why.

254
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,041
- They sing it pretty well.
- Mm-hm.

255
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,678
When something's really
wonderful like that, I know it.

256
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,181
I get kind of a funny feeling
up the back of my neck.

257
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:29,102
That's how I can tell. Sort of
makes my hair stand on end.

258
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,438
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

259
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,023
Looks pretty normal from here.

260
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,318
It just feels that way!

261
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,647
- Remember that lake?
- Yes, I do.

262
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,995
- Where do you go from here?
- We're heading east.

263
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,457
Chicago, New York. We're booked
into the Club Fifty there.

264
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,417
- Ever been to New York?
- No.

265
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,919
Neither have I. I hear
it's quite a town.

266
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,999
You're certainly seeing
America, aren't you?

267
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,301
You think I'm kinda
rudderless, don't you?

Wandering over the
country with the band.

269
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,348
- Yes, I guess I do.
- But I'm not, though.

270
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,604
I know exactly where I'm going.
I know exactly what I want to do.

271
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,105
You do?

272
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,026
I'm not gonna be a sideman all
my life, a trombone player.

273
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,445
I'm gonna have a
band all of my own.

274
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,448
I'm gonna play my
own kind of music.

275
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,911
I... It's hard to
explain, but a band...

276
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:32,788
A band oughta have a sound all of
its own, oughta have a personality.

277
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,211
- Sort of like a person.
- Uh-huh.

278
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,755
How do you get this
different sound?

279
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,424
You see, the arrangements,

280
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,844
the way you score each one of
the individual instruments.

281
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,847
Some bands have that sound
already, like Pollack,

282
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,600
but it's not the right
sound, not for me.

283
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,645
- What is?
- I don't know.

284
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,397
I don't know.
I haven't found it yet.

285
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,984
But someday I'm gonna
find it and when I do...

286
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,563
You'll find it. I'm sure you will.

287
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,072

- Hey, Glenn!

There's Chummy. He found
it all right. Goodbye.

289
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,208
It's been wonderful seeing you.
Goodbye. I'm comin'!

290
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,333
You'll be hearing from me.
Wait and see.

291
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,927

- All right, all right.

- Where have you been, Mr Miller?
- Dr Schillinger!

453
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:29,032
- It must be over a year.
- Glad to see you. This is my wife.

454
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,119
- Very pleased to meet you.
- You remember Chummy.

455
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,415
I missed you but I can see you
had a very charming distraction.

456
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:39,293
Yeah, well, glad to
see you, Doctor.

457
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:43,005
- Who's Dr Schillinger? Were you sick?
- No, he's a musician.

458
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,592
He worked out a new method of
composition. I studied with him.

459
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:50,596
- Why did you stop?
- I got busy and it was expensive.

460
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,925
Want something else to eat?

461

- Maybe we'd better call it a day.
- No, I'm having a...

- The ironing.

this is a hotel.

- No.

- It's just terrible.
- Is that so?

waste our money like that.

Well, you know the music.

Glenn, I've been thinking. How much
does that Dr Schillinger charge?

499
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,977
He's pretty expensive.
I don't know exactly.

I haven't worked
with him for years.

Well, I've been working

I've been sort of disappointed.

You mean that?

508
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,556
If I started to study again, we'd
have to make all sorts of sacrifices.

509
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,885
I'd have to give up
those record dates.

Why don't I call Schillinger right now?

exactly $1 a month.

601
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,520
So in ten years we'll
have made $120.

602
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,270
It takes time for a
new band to catch on.

603
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,025
It sure does.

604
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,237
I don't know. One night we
pack 'em in and they love us.

605
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,531
The next six dates we die.

606
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,867
We don't seem to be getting
anywhere, and we don't deserve to!

607
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:24,247
I just haven't been able to
hit the right combination.

608
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:28,544
I just still haven't
got that sound.

609
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:32,381
Glenn, maybe if you stop playing.

610
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,967
- Touché!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

611
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:39,679
I know what you mean. Get a
baton and start leading. No.

612
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,516
Once you step out in front of the boys,
you can never be a sideman again.

613
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,643
I'll stick to my trombone.

614
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,937
I've got some good
news for a change.

615
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:52,191
I talked to Si Schribman. He runs
the State Ballroom in Boston.

616
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,444
He's booked you in for
the week of the 22nd.

617
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,447
That means six half-hour air
spots. That's what counts.

618
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:01,618
- It sure does!
- Imagine! A whole week in one town.

619
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,329
I could even get the washing
and the mending done.

620
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,540
- Let's all drink to Boston!
- I think we should.

621
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,743
Good ol' Boston.

622
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,636
Glenn, why don't you ever
use Moonlight Serenade?

623
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:23,097
Don't we have enough trouble
without resurrecting that?

624
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,933
- Well, I liked it.
- So did I.

625
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:29,263
That's two of us. Now, if
we can just find a third.

626
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,783
- How's she look?
- Could be worse. Don't know how.

627
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:44,535
You need a new axle
housing, an axle shaft,

628
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,580
ring gear and pinion,
differential gear case.

629
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,958
- How long'll it take?
- A few days once I get the parts.

630
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:55,254
- You don't have 'em here?
- Don't have many calls for ring gears.

631
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:59,258
Might have to go to Woodstock
soon as it stops snowing.

632
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,461
- It could be worse.
- Yeah.

633
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,722
There's Helen. Get a
hold of Schribman?

634
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,851
No, I couldn't get Boston.
The telephone lines are down.

635
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,854
Chummy, you and Helen
better try and make Boston.

636
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,399
Tell Schribman we'll be
there as soon as we can.

637
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,443
He's probably guessed
what happened.

638
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,114
- He wouldn't cancel on us.
- No, we'll get there all right.

639
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,409
We can't lose that week in Boston.
Go ahead. Bye, dear.

640
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,578
- Take care.
- Yeah.

641
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,386
- You Mr Miller?
- Yeah.

642
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:47,682
Man left a message. Your wife's sick.
They got her to the hospital.

643
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,386
- What hospital?
- Boston Memorial.

644
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,816
Mr Miller, she's a very sick girl.

645
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:00,570
We gave her a transfusion but we're
lucky this happened when it did.

646
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:04,782
A few months further along and we might've
lost the mother as well as the child.

647
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,951
I had no idea that she was...

648
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,120
- All right, Doctor.
- Thank you.

649
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,415
Just for a minute.

650
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,970
Helen.

651
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,522
The truck all right?

652
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,865
Five and a quarter, cash on the barrel
head. Take it or leave it, boys.

653
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,992
Better than the others.

654
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,328
I guess we'll have to take it.

655
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,290
Kinda leaves us in a spot. It's
$900 to pay the boys in the band.

656
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,417
With my car? How
much'll you give us?

657
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,545
- You're not gonna do it.
- I can sell my own car if I want to.

658
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,800
Four hundred. That makes nine and
a quarter for all three of 'em.

659
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:08,012
- This isn't your problem.
- Why isn't it? I wanna get paid off, too.

660
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,306
You got a deal. Just one condition.

661
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,476
I need the car long enough to
drive the boys to the station.

662
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,144
Yes, that can be arranged.

663
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,231
Fellas, pile in. I'll
drive you to the station.

664
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,526
Thank you, Chummy.

665
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,074
- Hi, dear. How do you feel?
- Fine.

666
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,618
- You look much better.
- Good.

667
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,788
The doctor said if I behave
myself, I'll be up in a few days.

668
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,665
Good.

669
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,709
I've made up my mind about
something, young lady.

670
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,712
If I ever go on the road again,

671
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:46,217
you're gonna stay in that nice
apartment of ours on East 57th Street.

672
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,386
You just listen to
me, Glenn Miller.

673
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,556
You enticed a little country
girl to run away and marry you

674
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,307
and now you're hooked with her.

675
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:57,311
And I'm not gonna let you go gallivanting
around the country without me.

676
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,648
You're hooked with a no-good
itinerant musician.

677
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:04,777
- I'm not complaining.
- I know. You never do.

678
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,656
But I know how you wanted kids.

679
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,951
I want to tell you something else
I've made up my mind about.

680
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:15,162
We're not gonna have just one
child. We're gonna have two!

681
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,290
We're gonna have a boy and a girl.

682
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,125
- Glenn, I can't.
- I know.

683
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,544
The doctor told me, but I mean it.

684
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:26,797
There'll be two kids meant for us.
Somewhere we're gonna find them.

685
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,763
I hope so.

686
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,102
Who sent these flowers?

687
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,438
- The boys in the band.
- Wasn't that nice?

688
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,641
They're sweet.

689
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,603
What's happened? Any dates?

690
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,282
No. No dates.

691
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,534
There's no band.

692
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,203
We had to sell the cars
and pay off the boys.

693
00:56:56,204 --> 00:57:00,207
Chummy had to sell his Phaeton.
Isn't that a shame?

694
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,082
Poor Chummy really loved that car.

695
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,258
Glenn, you had a good band.

696
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,637
It was getting better all the
time. It wasn't your fault.

697
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,014
It's my fault all right!

698
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,975
I'm broke, I'm in debt,
I don't even have a job.

699
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:23,022
I told you before, you've gotten mixed
up with a no-good itinerant musician.

700
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:26,898
- And I love him.
- And I love you.

701
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,657
It's almost worth it.

702
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:37,580
It's the first time you've told me
that since the day we were married.

703
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,087
Come in.

704
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:57,181
- Mrs Miller?
- Yes.

705
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,850
I thought so. I can come in?

706
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,053
Well, yes, of course.

707
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,857
I brought you some flowers.

708
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,153
Oh. Well, thank you very much.

709
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,159
- They're all right?
- They're lovely.

710
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,205
I'm a bachelor, I got no wife
to tell me these things.

711
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,166
- Well, they're very pretty.
- Yeah.

712
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,336
I heard all about the band
and how you were sick.

713
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,632
Such a shame. I can
sit down a minute?

714
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,134
Yes, please.

715
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,797
"Compliments of the
State Ballroom."

716
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:41,684
- Is this a joke?
- I shoulda said so right away.

717
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,270
No, that's me. Si Schribman.

718
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,106
Si Schribman! If I'd
known who you were...

719
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,818
I know. Don Haynes said you wanted
to give me a piece of your mind.

720
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,862
That's why I came here.

721
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,612
Maybe we can exchange
pieces of mind.

722
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,995
I'm not really such an ogre.
I didn't like cancelling you out.

723
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:04,874
But an old widow lady, 75,
she owns that ballroom.

724
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,251
If I don't have a band,
I don't pay the rent.

725
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,838
If I don't pay the rent,
that old lady don't eat.

726
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,133
It's a bad situation.

727
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:18,596
If she would only die, God forbid,
then I could run it like I like.

728
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:21,474
- It finished us. You know that.
- Yeah.

729
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,268
- We had to break up the band.
- I know.

730
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,729
I heard the band. It was good.

731
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,648
Not great, mind you,
but good, very good.

732
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:35,029
We were just getting started. Well,
now I don't know what we'll do.

733
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:40,282
Just don't you worry, young lady. Get
well, and don't worry about the band.

734
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,828
That's easy to say.

735
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,790
I believe in Glenn and I believe
what he's trying to do,

736
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,993
so naturally I worry.

737
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:52,046
I tell you, you send him
over, he should see me.

738
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,799
With my own money that
don't go to the widow,

739
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,469
- I sometimes invest in bands.
- Do you mean that?

740
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:02,015
Would I make myself so
much trouble if I didn't?

741
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,893
But there's a problem.
I know Glenn.

742
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,896
He's down right now and
he won't accept help.

743
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:11,899
I don't think he'd risk
somebody else's money.

744
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,735
I never even met your husband
and I like him already.

745
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,780
You just leave it to me.
I'll cook up something.

746
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,157
Thank you very much for coming.

747
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,451
And I'm sorry I was so ungracious.

748
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:27,456
Who was ungracious? We got along
fine exchanging pieces of mind.

749
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,830
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

750
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,425
I know you don't want
a band but I'm stuck.

751
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:42,596
But this Charley Firman sneaks a
band right out from under my nose.

752
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:47,101
- I don't have any men. No money.
- I'll give you the money. Here.

753
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:51,188
Five hundred. Six hundred.
A thousand.

754
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,358
There. You got the money.
Now, go get the men.

755
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:59,738
I've tried all sorts of combinations.
I never found out what I was looking for.

756
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:04,201
If I start again, I've got to have an
entirely different kind of a band.

757
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,204
Different tunes. I wanna
try something radical.

758
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,666
Fine. Go get radical,
but just get going!

759
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,373
I gotta have something in here making
a noise the kids can dance to.

760
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,923
OK.

761
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:28,517
- Let's have the five saxes right in there.
- Five saxes?

762
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,103
And the trombones over there.

763
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,814
And the four trumpets
right behind them.

764
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,066
Four trombones and four trumpets!

765
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,819
When they play, what's
gonna hold the roof on?

766
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,071
Five saxes and a trumpet lead.

767
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:44,116
Maybe it's good and maybe
it ain't, but it's radical.

768
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,576
Let's try this.

769
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:49,371
Remember this is a ballad, so take
it nice and easy, don't bruise it.

770
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:53,500
Joe, you stand up so I can get a balance
between you and the saxophones.

771
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,252
All right, here we go.

772

What's the matter?

776
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,131
- He cut his lip.
- Let's see.

777
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,718
Oh, no. You really split it open.
You better have it looked at.

- I'm sorry, Glenn.
- Go on, Joe. Take care of it.

Oh, no.

All right, take five, boys.

781
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,322
- Is it bad?
- He'll be out for weeks.

782
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,825
- You get more tough breaks...
- Just when you got a good sound.

783
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,912
It isn't what I want but if
we could've worked on it...

784
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:58,042
- You can't find another trumpet blower?
- Not with Joe's range.

785
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,711
All the arrangements
have a trumpet lead?

786
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,672
He had to hurt his lip
the day before you open.

787
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,175
What are we gonna do?
Postpone the opening?

788
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,845
- Poor old widow lady.
- We're not gonna postpone anything.

789
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:14,058
We'll open tomorrow if I have to stay up
all night and rewrite the arrangement.

790
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:17,644
- You can't. It's impossible.
- Wait a minute!

791
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,022
Just a minute. I have an idea.

792
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:24,485
Willie Schwartz could play those
parts on clarinet. Why not?

793
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,612
You see? Clarinet lead. Why not?

794
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,698
Get me lots of manuscript paper.
Can I use your office?

795
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,450
Sure.

796
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:35,412
Clarinet lead. Why not? And, Don,
call Helen, tell her not to worry.

797
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,415
Tell her I'll be here all night.
Clarinet lead.

798
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,496
And I can harmonise it real
tight, all in the same octave.

You rested up ready
for the big night?

822
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,203
We've had a wonderful
time with little Stevie.

823
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,372
- Quite a boy. Big for his age.
- Isn't he?

824
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,876
I can't tell you how much
it's meant to us to have him.

- Is everything all set?
- Yes, dear.

- Did you get Helen out of the house?
- Oh, yes.

827
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:09,676
- Where'd she go?
- I suppose she's shopping.

wedding anniversary every day!

- Oh, no.

- Is everything all set back here?
- Oh, yes.

831

I think Helen'll get a
big kick out of this.

She certainly will, Glenn.

Quite a place you got here.

It's beautiful, Glenn.

- Yes, it's paid for.

Don't suppose it pays much.

Then there's the records. And he's
playing at the Hotel Pennsylvania.

How much do they pay for playing
on one of those records?

- We get three cents a record.
- Three cents?

841
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,871
Have to sell a heap of records
to make it worthwhile.

can go on up there.

- Six weeks today.
- Old lady.

Glad to see ya.

That's good.

Come on, don't stand around.
Come on! Dance it up!

905

Come on, let's try something.

906
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:20,297
- That's pretty good. Let's try that again.
- All right.

907
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,135
I think I better go
back to the trombone.

908
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,348
You sit down there.

called me that night.

So am I. All right, let's
have something to eat.

913

Come on. Come on, dear.

914
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:48,176
- We're cutting a record of that.
- A record?

915
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,886
- Three cents?
- Right.

916

That's my boy!

917
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,517
You oughta use that
number in your picture.

918
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,894
Picture?

919
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:00,897
Glenn and the boys are gonna
do a movie in the fall.

920
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,441
- Are you gonna be a movie star?
- Yes, Mother.

921
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:08,193
I'm gonna play Tarzan and swing
from the trees playing my trombone.

922
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,615
I'd like to propose a toast.

923

To Glenn and Helen, who serve
the best food in town.

924
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:17,955
Besides, the price is right. We can
remember when it wasn't like this.

925
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:22,377
May you be as happy together
always as you are tonight.

926
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,175
Thank you, Chummy.
That was a very nice speech.

927
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,761
It oughta be,
I worked on it all day!

- You did?

I thought your special number was gonna
be Helen's favourite, Little Brown Jug.

930
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,972
He'd never do that. He hates it.

up sooner or later.

- I thought you'd like lunch.

I brought the mail.

Chummy, we still have a little time.
Why don't you go over At Last?

948
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,616
Let's go up to the control booth.

- Anything wrong?
- No, no.

Come on, sit down, honey.

951
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,877
Helen, I wanted to
talk to you about...

952
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:36,964
With this picture deal and the
record sales and everything,

953
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,592
- we're pretty well fixed.
- Yes.

954
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:43,512
And, no matter what
happens, you and the kids,

955
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:46,974
- you're in good shape.
- Yes, I know.

956
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,310
Can you come to Men's
Wardrobe at two?

957
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,562
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

958
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,266
So, I thought that...

959
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,902
What I'm trying to get at...

960
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,029
I've been thinking... Yeah?

961
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:03,032
On Tuxedo Junction, we'll
have a wax right after lunch.

962
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,361
Fine. Thanks very much.

- So...
- Open the letter from the War Department.

964
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:14,210
- I'm sure it's your commission.
- How do you know?

965
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:18,422
I've known it for months. I knew
it was only a question of time.

966
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:23,302
I just put in for it two weeks ago. I guess
you found out about it before I did.

967
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,555
Go on, open it. I want to
know what to call you.

How soon will you be
leaving, Captain Miller?

973
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:50,037
I don't know. It usually
takes about a month.

974
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,623
Don wants to go with me,
so do some of the boys.

975
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,793
- Are you gonna have your own band?
- I hope so.

976
01:26:55,794 --> 01:27:00,256
You know, all the kids that liked
our music are in the service.

977

- That's the reason I...
- I understand.

978
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,678
I think you'll look very
handsome in uniform.

01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:10,015
What do you think about it?
Are you upset?

980
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:13,227
Of course I'm upset.
I don't want you to go

981
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:17,433

more upset if you didn't.

- Do we have to play this kind of music?

984
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,507
We've marched to this music
for a hundred years.

01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:47,588
- That's what I mean.
- We're not gonna change now, Captain.

- Sorry, Colonel.
- And walking through a reviewing column!

- I had to get to the band, sir.
- Then playing blues!

993
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:41,769
You made a laughing stock of this entire
unit, and in front of General Arnold!

994

- I had no such intentions.
- What was your intention?

Blasting out right in
the General's face!

- The men's condition is my responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:57,534
I must warn you that your conduct
calls for disciplinary action.

Keep up the good work.

- May I make a suggestion, sir?
- Certainly.

1011

I'd like to suggest that I be given
the authority to form my own band.

with you, Miller.

Don't you see what Si's getting at?

If the band goes on, even if Glenn's
not with it, that's the proof.
