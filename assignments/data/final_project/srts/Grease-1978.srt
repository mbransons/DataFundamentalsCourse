1
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,420
# Love

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,000
# Is a many splendoured thing

4
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,670
I'm going back to Australia,
I won't see you again.

5
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,790
Don't talk that way, Sandy.

6
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,590
But it's true.

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,720
I've had the best summer of my life.
Now I have to go away. It isn't fair.

8
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,610
- Danny, don't spoil it.
- Sandy, it's only making it better.

9
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,950
Danny, is this the end?

10
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,740
Of course not.

11
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,840
It's only the beginning.

12
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,420
This is the main brain,
Vince Fontaine,

13
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,120
beginning your day the only way.
Music, music.

14
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,760
Get out of bed, first day of school.

15
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,140
Don't be a slob, don't get a job,
go back to class, you can pass.

16
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,100
To start the day off nice and fine,
here's a new old favourite of mine.

17
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,850
# I solve my problems
and I see the light

18
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,140
# We got a lovin' thing

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,650
# We got to feed it right

20
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,030
# There ain't no danger
we can go too far

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,200
# We start believin' now

22
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,410
# That we can be who we are

23
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,580
# Grease is the word

24
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,380
# They think our love
is just a growin' pain

25
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,590
# Why don't they understand?

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,390
# It's just a cryin' shame

27
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,140
# Their lips are lying,
only real is real

28
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,560
# We stop the fight right now

29
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,650
# We got to be what we feel

30
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,400
# Grease is the word

31
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,150
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,450
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

33
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,830
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,660
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,010
# We take the pressure
and we throw away

36
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,100
# Conventionality

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,970
# Belongs to yesterday

38
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,810
# There is a chance
that we can make it so far

39
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,180
# We start believin' now

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,480
# That we can be who we are

41
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,940
# Grease is the word

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,860
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,000
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

44
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,160
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

45
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,430
# Now grease is the way
we are feelin'

46
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,750
# This is a life of illusion

47
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,600
# Wrapped up in troubles

48
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,180
# Laced in confusion

49
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,680
# What are we doing here?

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,640
# We take the pressure
and we throw away

51
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,850
# Conventionality

52
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,450
# Belongs to yesterday

53
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,610
# There is a chance
that we can make it so far

54
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,700
# We start believin' now

55
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,790
# That we can be who we are

56
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,530
# Grease is the word

57
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,590
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

58
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,920
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

59
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,390
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,940
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

61
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,910
# Grease is the word,
is the word that you've heard

62
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,620
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

63
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,100
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

64
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,840
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,020
# Grease is the word,
is the word, is the word

66
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,250
- You don't eat this, you bury it.
- That's a home-made lunch.

67
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,870
Your old lady drag her carcass
out of bed for you?

68
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,130
- She does it first day of school.
- Big deal.

69
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,050
- Kenickie. Over here.
- Where you at?

70
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,850
We're right here.

71
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,650
- Where were you all summer?
- Are you my mother?

72
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,190
- Just askin'.
- Working. More than you can say.

73
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,740
- Working?
- Yes, lugging boxes at Bargain City.

74
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,240
- Nice job.
- Eat me.

75
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,330
I'm saving up to get me some wheels.

76
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,200
- Wanna hear what I did?
- No.

77
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,540
Hey, there's Danny.

78
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,420
Danny! Danny!

79
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,350
You seen any new broads there?

80
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,020
Nah, same old chicks,
everybody's made them.

81
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,230
So what'd you do all summer?

82
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,030
I was hanging around at the beach.
You know.

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,080
It's tough with all those chicks
hanging around you.

84
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,250
The only thing
that hangs around you are the flies.

85
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,410
How was the action
at the beach, man?

86
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,040
Whew. It was flipping.

87
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,920
Yeah? Crazy?

88
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,430
I did meet this one chick.
She was sorta cool.

89
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
You mean she puts out?

90
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,020
Come on, Sonny,
is that all you think about?

91
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,850
- Freakin' A.
- (bell)

92
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,110
Hey, guys, wait up.

93
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,020
- Do I look OK, Frenchy?
- Sure, you look good.

94
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,490
- I'm really nervous.
- You look terrific.

95
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,530
- So, this is Rydell?
- Yep. You'll love it.

96
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,500
I loved the last school I was at.
I wish I was there right now.

97
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,120
Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak.

98
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,580
Why? You got psoriasis?

99
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,380
(car backfires)

100
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,740
Well, here we are again.

101
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,780
- But this time we're seniors.
- We're gonna rule the school.

102
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,790
(all laugh)

103
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,740
Jan, that is so adolescent.

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,410
- We are adolescent.
- We don't have to flaunt it.

105
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,090
OK, girls.

106
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,960
Let's go get 'em.

107
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,180
Blanche, do you have
the new schedules?

108
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,020
Yes, Miss McGee,
I just had my hands on them.

109
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,020
Oh, good, they'll be
nice and smudged.

110
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,900
Here we are. If it had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

111
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,620
These are the schedules
we couldn't find last semester.

112
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,200
Next year,
you might find this semester's.

113
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,080
- I've got Kenickie again.
- He's been here longer than I have.

114
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,470
First day of school and already
my castor oil is missing.

115
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,010
How many days
till Christmas vacation?

116
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,260
86.

117
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,360
- 86?
- And counting.

118
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,560
- Can I help you?
- Yes, it's my first day.

119
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,280
- I'm not sure where I should be.
- Welcome to Rydell.

120
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,200
You'll have to fill out
these forms, but...

121
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,000
Excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.

122
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,170
- Do you have a pencil, please?
- Yes, dear. There you are.

123
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,550
(bell)

124
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,440
Jeez. Every teacher I got this year
has flunked me at least once.

125
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,020
You'll spend your time
in McGee's office.

126
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,320
- She'll wish she'd never seen me.
- Yeah? And what are you gonna do?

127
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,360
I just ain't gonna take her crap.
I don't take no crap from nobody.

128
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,790
- Sonny?
- Oh, hello, ma'am.

129
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,000
- Shouldn't you be in home room?
- I was going for a walk.

130
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,290
- You were dawdling.
- Yes, ma'am.

131
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,960
That is no way to start
a new semester, Mr LaTierri.

132
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,500
(mutters in Italian)

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,180
Perhaps a session of banging erasers
after school would put you on track.

134
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,770
Yes, ma'am.

135
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,730
- Do you plan to stand there all day?
- No, ma'am. I mean, yes.

136
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,770
- Well, which is it?
- No, ma'am.

137
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,140
- Good. Then move.
- Yes, ma'am.

138
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,580
I'm glad you didn't take
any of her crap, Sonny.

139
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,530
You would have told her off, huh?

140
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,750
Mr LaTierri.
Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am...

141
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,870
Hey, Eugene.

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,990
How you doin'?

143
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,370
- Shake, buddy.
- (buzzing)

144
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,590
What's wrong?
You're wearing glasses.

145
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
- I got an astigmatism.
- Too bad.

146
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,100
(students) # As I go travelling down
life's highway

147
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,270
# Whatever course my fortunes
may foretell...

148
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,850
(chimes)

149
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,690
Good morning, boys and girls.
Welcome to what we're sure will be

150
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,950
our greatest year at Rydell.

151
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,500
Saturday night will be
our first pep rally and bonfire.

152
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,200
I want to see all of you students
out there,

153
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,090
with plenty of support for Coach
Calhoun and the Rydell Rangers.

154
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,380
If you can't be an athlete,
be an athletic supporter.

155
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,340
And now for the really good news.

156
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,470
One of the most exciting things

157
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,310
to ever happen at Rydell High.

158
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,230
National Bandstand television show

159
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,830
has selected Rydell as
a representative American high school

160
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,570
and will do a live broadcast
from our very own gym.

161
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,330
(cheering)

162
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,290
It is our chance
to show the entire nation

163
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,090
what fine, bright, clean-cut,

164
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,340
wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.

165
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,630
(screams)

166
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,900
# Ba, ba, bamba

167
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,980
# Ba, ba, bamba

168
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,900
# La, la, la, la, la bamba

169
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,490
Did you guys get a look
at Zuko this mornin'?

170
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,740
Lookin' pretty good this year,
huh, Rizz?

171
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,120
- That's ancient history.
- History sometimes repeats itself.

172
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,710
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi, Frenchy.

173
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,880
Go sit down.
This here is Sandy Olsen.

174
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,970
And that's Jan and Marty,
and this is Rizzo.

175
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,930
She just moved here
from Sydney, Australia.

176
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,090
- How are things down under?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

177
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,980
Marty, are those new glasses?

178
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,110
Yeah, just for school.
Do they make me look smarter?

179
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,400
Nah, you can still see your face.

180
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,030
- How d'you like school, Sandy?
- It's different.

181
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,660
- Hi, kids.
- (all groan)

182
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,540
Patty Simcox,
the bad seed of Rydell. Hi.

183
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,040
- I love the first day of school.
- The biggest thrill of my life.

184
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,880
- You won't guess what's happened.
- Probably not.

185
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,170
The nominees for Student Council
are out.

186
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,590
- Guess who's up for Vice President?
- Who?

187
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,470
Me. Isn't that the most?

188
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,590
- To say the least.
- The very least.

189
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,690
I hope I don't make a poor showing.

190
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,690
We wish you the best of luck,
don't we, girls?

191
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,560
I've got my fingers crossed.

192
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,570
Oh, you must think I'm a clod
for not introducing myself.

193
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,070
Hi, I'm Patty Simcox.

194
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,370
Welcome to Rydell. (squeals)

195
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,170
Will you be at cheerleader tryouts?
We'll be lifelong friends.

196
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,840
You guys, how do you like Sandy?

197
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,550
Do you think we can
let her in the Pink Ladies?

198
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,220
- She looks too pure to be pink.
- Ohh, double do-do!

199
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,470
What's up, doc?

200
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,310
One of my diamonds
just fell in the macaroni.

201
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,270
Kenickie, want a piece of salami?

202
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,030
Are you kidding?
If I eat that, I'll smell like you.

203
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,780
What a stink!

204
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,490
Hey, guys, look.

205
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
dingleberries on parade.

206
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,300
Look! You really put
your foot into it this time.

207
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,000
Try hopscotch, you hot dog.

208
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,970
What a gavone! Gumdrops, man.

209
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,640
Any of you guys see
that new chick in registration?

210
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,850
Sure beats
the foam domes round here.

211
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,610
Jugs bigger than Annette's?

212
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,030
Nobody's jugs
are bigger than Annette's.

213
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,000
Hey, guys. Hey!

214
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,920
Hi, girls.

215
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,210
You're a sick man, Putz.

216
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,680
Hey, I wanna hear about
what Danny did at the beach.

217
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,850
- It was nothing.
- Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right?

218
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,070
- You got in her drawers, right?
- Come on, tell us.

219
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,650
What did you do this summer?

220
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,060
I spent most of it at the beach.
I met a boy there.

221
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,900
You hauled your cookies
to the beach for a guy?

222
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,410
- He was sorta special.
- There ain't no such thing.

223
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,210
It was really romantic.

224
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,660
Everything about it.

225
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,710
You don't want to hear
the horny details.

226
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,470
Alright, I'll tell you.

227
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,630
# Summer lovin', had me a blast

228
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,550
# Summer lovin', happened so fast

229
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,060
# I met a girl, crazy for me

230
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,480
# Met a boy, cute as can be

231
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,650
# Summer days, drifting away

232
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,020
# To uh, oh, those summer nights

233
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,200
# Wella, wella, wella, huh

234
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,910
# Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?

235
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,710
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Like does he have a car?

236
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,420
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
- # Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do

237
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,470
# She swam by me, she got a cramp

238
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,010
# He ran by me, got my suit damp

239
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,180
# I saved her life,
she nearly drowned

240
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,650
# He showed off, splashing around

241
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,150
# Summer sun, something's begun

242
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,860
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

243
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,650
# Wella, wella, wella, huh

244
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,790
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Was it love at first sight?

245
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,670
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Did she put up a fight?

246
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,460
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
# Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum

247
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,840
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
# Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum

248
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,310
# Took her bowling in the arcade

249
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,270
# We went strolling, drank lemonade

250
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,770
# We made out, under the dock

251
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,320
# We stayed out till ten o'clock

252
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,620
# Summer fling, don't mean a thing

253
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,250
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

254
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,620
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # But you don't gotta brag

255
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,630
# Tell me more, tell me more

256
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,580
# Cos he sounds like a drag

257
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,170
# Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop

258
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,890
# Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, yeah!

259
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,940
# He got friendly, holding my hand

260
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,190
# She got friendly, down in sand

261
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,860
# He was sweet, just turned 1 8

262
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,160
# Well, she was good,
you know what I mean

263
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,910
# Summer heat, boy and girl meet

264
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,960
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

265
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,750
# Whoa, whoa, whoa

266
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,550
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # How much dough did he spend?

267
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,840
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Could she get me a friend?

268
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,140
# It turned colder,
that's where it ends

269
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,350
# So I told her we'd still be friends

270
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,410
# Then we made our true love vow

271
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:30,710
# Wonder what she's doing now

272
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,710
# Summer dreams

273
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,090
# Ripped at the seams

274
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,220
# But

275
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,140
# Oh

276
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,310
# Those summer

277
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,900
# Nights

278
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,740
# Tell me more, tell me more

279
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,090
He sounds real nice.

280
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,640
True love and he didn't lay
a hand on you? Sounds like a creep.

281
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,140
He wasn't. He was a gentleman.

282
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,890
What was his name?

283
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,850
Danny. Danny Zuko.

284
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,390
(all giggle)

285
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,440
Well, I think he sounds peachy keen.

286
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,900
Maybe, if you believe in miracles,

287
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,740
Prince Charming will show up again
someday.

288
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,700
Somewhere unexpected.

289
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,500
See you later. Come on, girls.

290
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,050
- Do you really think so, Frenchy?
- Sure.

291
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,680
Erm, ... Sandy, I think
we oughta get to class.

292
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,040
(all) Do the splits, give a yell

293
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,070
Show a little spirit for old Rydell

294
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,370
Way to go, red and white

295
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,960
Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight!

296
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,260
(fanfare)

297
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,880
And now...

298
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,810
Quiet, please.

299
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,810
Quiet, everyone. Now, boys and girls,
the man of the hour.

300
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,770
The coach we're all depending on

301
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,440
to pull Rydell out of
a seven-season slump,

302
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,370
our very own Coach Calhoun.

303
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,330
(cheering)

304
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,760
- Who's the best?
- (all) Rydell!

305
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,470
Give 'em hell, Rydell!

306
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,270
I just wanna tell you students
that we have a banner year coming up.

307
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,520
Because my boys are primed,
really primed,

308
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,530
because I primed 'em.

309
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Not only primed, they're honed.
Honed to a sharp razor-edge.

310
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,780
We're not just going out there
to win.

311
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,960
We're going out there for glory.
And when we get out there,

312
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,630
we're gonna yank 'em and tear 'em

313
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,550
and rip 'em.

314
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,340
We'll take 'em and roll 'em around
and rip 'em up to pieces!

315
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,680
Then we're gonna slaughter 'em.

316
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
And after the slaughter is over,

317
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,270
we're gonna come back here
and ring that victory bell.

318
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,740
Like we always wanted to.

319
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,680
Watch this.

320
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,770
Nyik-nyak, nyik-nyak
Brrr, nyik-nyak

321
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,770
Do a split, give a yell
Shake a tit for old Rydell!

322
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,620
Guys.

323
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,200
Be cool, huh?

324
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,080
Hey, watch out, pinhead!

325
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,750
Well, what do you think?

326
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,840
What a hunk of junk.

327
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,640
Wait till I give it a paint job,
soup up the engine.

328
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,020
She'll run like a champ.
I'm racing her at Thunder Road.

329
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,060
- Thunder Road?
- Yeah. Wanna make something of it?

330
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,610
I wanna see you
make something of this heap.

331
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,780
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

332
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,580
What are Scorpions doing here?
It ain't their turf.

333
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,700
- Think they wanna rumble?
- If they do, we'll be ready.

334
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,550
Alright, gang. Let's go get 'em!

335
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,180
- Hey, chicken.
- Whoo-hoo!

336
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,060
What you doing?

337
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,820
- Thanks, Frenchy.
- That's alright.

338
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,080
- You were great out there.
- I messed up, I was so nervous.

339
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,910
- Your split was divoon.
- Hi, Sandy.

340
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,960
- Hi, Rizz. Hi, girls.
- We got a surprise for you.

341
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,460
- What is it?
- You'll see.

342
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,700
Right, Rizz?

343
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,420
Let me comb your hair down.

344
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,510
Where are we going?

345
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,380
Want a little lipstick?

346
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,760
If you fix up this car,
it could be make-out city.

347
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,260
A chick is gonna have to put out
before she even gets in.

348
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,770
You'd better believe it.

349
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,900
Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you.

350
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,770
Oh, yeah?

351
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,240
Yeah.

352
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,150
- Sandy!
- Danny?

353
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,990
What are you doing here?
I thought you were back in Australia.

354
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,700
We had a change of plan.

355
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,530
I can't...

356
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,430
That's cool, baby. You know how it
is. Rockin' and rollin' and whatnot.

357
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,180
- Danny?
- That's my name, don't wear it out.

358
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,560
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

359
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,760
What's the matter with you?

360
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,270
What happened to the Danny Zuko
I met at the beach?

361
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,730
Well, I do not know.
Maybe there's two of us, right?

362
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,450
Why don't you take out
a missing-persons ad or...

363
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,870
...try the Yellow Pages?
I don't know.

364
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,840
You're a fake and a phoney.
I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

365
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
(all) Ooohhh...

366
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,130
I wonder if she carries
silver bullets!

367
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,050
So she laid her eyes on you,
huh, Zuko?

368
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,350
I bet that's not all
she's laid on him.

369
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,100
- Hey, Zuke! I got a car, remember?
- Come on, Danny.

370
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,740
- Who's got beer money?
- I swiped my brother's ID.

371
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,460
He was so nice to me this summer.

372
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,620
Listen, Sandy, men are rats.

373
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,670
Listen to me.
They're fleas on rats.

374
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,710
Worse than that,
they're amoebas on fleas on rats.

375
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,510
I mean, they're too low
for even the dogs to bite.

376
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,100
The only man a girl can depend on
is her daddy.

377
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,480
You know what you need?
A night out with the girls.

378
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,160
We're having a sleep-over
at my house tonight. Wanna come?

379
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,290
Good. You'll love it. Come on.

380
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,710
Hey, look at Jan.

381
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,750
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Get the new Ipana

382
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,970
# With the brand-new flavour
It's dandy for your teeth

383
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,340
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a,
New Ipana toothpaste

384
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,600
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Knocks out decay germs fast

385
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,890
# Fast, fast, you sure are right

386
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,400
Turn it off.

387
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,140
- Hand me a ciggie butt.
- Yeah, me, too.

388
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,360
- Want one, Sandy?
- I don't smoke.

389
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,190
- You don't?
- Go ahead, try it. It won't kill ya.

390
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,800
Oh, I forgot to say, you shouldn't
inhale unless you're used to it.

391
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,170
Sandy, let me teach you how to
French inhale. It's really cool.

392
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,340
God. That is
the ugliest-Iooking thing I ever saw.

393
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,480
The guys really go for it.
It's how I got my nickname.

394
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,320
Sure it is.

395
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,770
OK, how about a little Sneaky Pete
to get the party goin'?

396
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,120
Italian Swiss Colony?
Wow, it's imported.

397
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,450
I brought Twinkies.
Anybody want one?

398
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,500
Twinkies and wine?
That's real class, Jan.

399
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,710
It says right here
it is a dessert wine.

400
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,420
Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine.

401
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,170
- Oh, that's OK.
- I bet you never had a drink before.

402
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,430
I had champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

403
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,970
Ring-a-ding-ding!

404
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,260
What's wrong? We don't got cooties.

405
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,030
Hey, Sandy. Would you like me
to pierce your ears for ya?

406
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,490
- (jeering)
- Shut up!

407
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,330
Isn't it awfully dangerous?

408
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,500
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to be a beautician.

409
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,330
- What's the matter? You afraid?
- No, I'm not.

410
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,300
- Here, Frenchy, use my virgin pin.
- It's good for somethin'.

411
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,590
- It's not a good idea.
- It's OK.

412
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,300
My father won't like it. (screams)

413
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,850
Sandy, let's go into the bathroom.

414
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,900
My mother'll kill me
if I get blood on the carpet.

415
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,400
- It only bleeds for a second.
- I don't feel very well.

416
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,520
Don't worry. If she screws up,

417
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,690
she can fix your hair
so your ears don't show.

418
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,170
Sandy, Sandy, beauty is pain.

419
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,790
(screams)

420
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,330
Could you get some ice
to numb her ears?

421
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,460
Let the cold water run
and stick her ear under the faucet.

422
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,970
Personally,
I'm getting rather chilly.

423
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,980
- Hey, what's that?
- From Bobby in Korea.

424
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,310
- Are you going with a Korean?
- Dummy, he's a marine.

425
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,820
A marine? Whooo!

426
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,440
Wanna see a picture?

427
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,870
God. You're turning into
a one-woman USO.

428
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,870
Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick.

429
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,210
I just did one ear.
She saw the blood and... bleurgh!

430
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,290
You won't get your hands on my ears.

431
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:12,090
Yeah? You'll be sorry. I have been
accepted to La Cafury Beauty School.

432
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,300
You're dropping out of Rydell?

433
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:19,230
I don't see it as dropping out. I see
it as a very strategic career move.

434
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,940
- Why's it torn in half?
- His old girlfriend was in it.

435
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,450
Er, ... Sandy,
here's your toothbrush.

436
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,870
Thanks, Frenchy.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.

437
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,790
It's OK.

438
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,930
Miss Goody Two-Shoes
makes me wanna barf.

439
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,430
# Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee

440
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,260
# Lousy with virginity

441
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,010
# Won't go to bed
Till I'm legally wed

442
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,150
# I can't, I'm Sandra Dee

443
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,570
Watch it.

444
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,860
# Hey, I'm Doris Day

445
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,820
# I was not brought up that way

446
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,210
# Won't come across
Even Rock Hudson lost

447
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,380
# His heart to Doris Day

448
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,080
- # I don't drink
- No!

449
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,710
- # Or swear
- Oh!

450
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,670
- # I don't rat my hair
- Yeurgh!

451
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,810
# I get ill from one cigarette
(coughs)

452
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,100
# Keep your filthy paws
Off my silky drawers

453
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,900
# Would you pull that crap
with Annette?

454
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,360
# As for you, Troy Donahue

455
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,570
# I know what you wanna do

456
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,790
# You've got your crust
I'm no object of lust

457
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,200
# I'm just plain Sandra Dee

458
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,590
# Elvis! Elvis!

459
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,760
# Let me be

460
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,670
# Keep that pelvis far from me

461
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,550
# Just keep your cool
Now you're starting to drool

462
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,720
# Hey, fongool

463
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,390
# I'm Sandra Dee

464
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,080
Making fun of me, Rizz?

465
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,780
Some people are so touchy.

466
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,890
- # Later on they start to scratch...
- Shut up, you vultures.

467
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,680
I changed my mind. Let's go.

468
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,100
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

469
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,850
(squealing)

470
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,280
- They can't come. My folks'll flip.
- Putzie, you call her.

471
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,610
Oh, Sandy.
Wherefore art thou, Sandy?

472
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,320
Shut up! Sit down.

473
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,120
You goody-goodies are too much.

474
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,410
I'm gonna get my kicks while
I'm still young enough to get 'em.

475
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,870
Is she gonna
shinny down the drainpipe?

476
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,050
Hey, look. There's Rizzo.

477
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,580
You're doing that without a net.

478
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,600
Swell bunch, rushing to help a lady.

479
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,440
- Lady? I don't see a lady.
- Shut up. Shut up!

480
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,740
- What's up, Kenick?
- One guess.

481
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,610
- You got a lot to offer a girl.
- Yeah, you know it.

482
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,740
- What say you, Zuke?
- You're lookin' good, Rizz.

483
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,620
- Eat your heart out.
- Sloppy seconds ain't my style.

484
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,880
You going to flog your log?

485
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,590
It's better than hanging around
with you dorks.

486
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,890
Your chariot, my lady.

487
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,860
I don't know what I saw
in Danny Zuko.

488
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,570
Don't sweat it, honey.
Have one of mine.

489
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,540
- There's so many of them.
- I know.

490
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,800
- How do you keep up with them?
- I'm a terrific pen pal.

491
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,140
Hopelessly devoted to every one.

492
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,320
What are you doing?

493
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,360
OK. What do you think this is?
A gangbang?

494
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,360
- You wish.
- (all laugh)

495
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,650
Hit the pavement.

496
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,200
You gotta be kidding.

497
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,400
- I said now.
- Alright.

498
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,280
Remember us in your will.

499
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,920
When a guy picks a chick
over his buddies, something's wrong.

500
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,270
Come on, guys,
let's go for a slice of pizza.

501
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,640
Can I have some of that?

502
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,850
Sure.

503
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,140
- Thanks.
- Wait.

504
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,410
(door closes)

505
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:28,100
# Guess mine is not
the first heart broken

506
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:34,140
# My eyes are not the first
to cry

507
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,520
# I'm not the first to know

508
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,530
# There's just no getting over you

509
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,170
# You know,
I'm just a fool who's willing

510
00:33:55,050 --> 00:34:00,210
# To sit around and wait for you

511
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,180
# But, baby, can't you see?

512
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,600
# There's nothing else for me to do

513
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:16,480
# I'm hopelessly devoted to you

514
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,910
# But now there's nowhere to hide

515
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,240
# Since you pushed my love aside

516
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,790
# I'm out of my head

517
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,680
# Hopelessly devoted to you

518
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:43,590
# Hopelessly devoted to you

519
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:53,070
# Hopelessly devoted to you

520
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,160
# My head is saying

521
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,340
# Fool, forget him

522
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,500
# My heart is saying

523
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,050
# Don't let go

524
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,550
# Hold on to the end

525
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,010
# And that's what I intend to do

526
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:25,520
# I'm hopelessly devoted to you

527
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,320
# But now there's nowhere to hide

528
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,660
# Since you pushed my love aside

529
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,490
# I'm out of my head

530
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:45,140
# Hopelessly devoted to you

531
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:51,800
# Hopelessly devoted to you

532
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:02,450
# Hopelessly devoted to you

533
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,500
(radio) Is acne ruining your life?

534
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,160
Do you close your eyes when you
look in the mirror? Fear no more.

535
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,550
Face up to Face-Off, for deep
penetration into infected pores.

536
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,720
Help dry up unsightly pimples
and blemishes...

537
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,890
(grunts)

538
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:43,740
- Rizz. Rizz.
- Could you call me by my first name?

539
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,750
Oh, erm...

540
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,990
Betty.

541
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,750
Betty. Betty.

542
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,220
- Have you got something?
- Are you kidding?

543
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,900
My 25-cent insurance policy.

544
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,850
Big spender.

545
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,690
- What?
- It broke.

546
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,990
How could it break?

547
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,910
I bought it
when I was in seventh grade.

548
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,130
Ohhh...

549
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,850
What the hell?

550
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,940
(crash)

551
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,030
- What the hell are you doin'?
- It's a no-parking zone, creep.

552
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,250
The whole place is a no-parking zone,
crater-face.

553
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,420
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

554
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,630
(crash)

555
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,750
You're gonna pay for that.

556
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,010
I'll give you 75 cents for
the whole car, including your chick.

557
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,520
We just have to bang out the dent.

558
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,440
The problem's not in the dent,
it's this rubber-band engine.

559
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,280
- The problem's your mouth.
- Where you gonna get a carburettor?

560
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,790
- Ever heard of borrowing?
- Kenickie, you got any Scotch tape?

561
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,710
Hey, big stuff.
What do you drive, huh?

562
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,000
- I drive.
- Yeah? How about you?

563
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,760
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

564
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,710
What about Doody?

565
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,470
- Well, I...
- That's what I thought.

566
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,470
C'mon, guys. This car could be
a major piece of machinery. Look.

567
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,150
This car could be systematic.

568
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,480
Hydromatic.

569
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,780
Ultramatic.

570
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,490
It could be Greased Lightning.

571
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,460
# You get some overhead lifters
and four-barrel quads, oh, yeah

572
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,880
# Keep talking, whoa, keep talking

573
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,040
# With fuel-injection cut-off
and chrome-plated rods, oh, yeah

574
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,750
# We'll get her ready
We'll get her ready

575
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,890
# With a four-speed on the floor
They'll be waiting at the door

576
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,640
# You know that ain't no shit
We'll be getting lots of tit

577
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,600
- # In Greased Lightning
- # Go, go, go

578
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,060
# Go-go-go-go

579
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,440

# Go, go, go, go-go-go-go

586
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:49,180
# With purple French taillights
and 30-inch fins, oh, yeah

587
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,680
# A palomino dashboard
and dual-muffler twins, oh, yeah

588
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,850

I can get off my rocks

589
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,930

She's a real pussy wagon

590

603
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,460
Come on, guys. Let's get to work.

604
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,840
(yelling)

605
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,150
Those Scorpions,
they're asking for it.

606
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,820
Danny, what's up?
You still thinking about that chick?

607
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,040
- You nuts?
- No, I was just thinking.

608
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,740
- Don't think so much.
- That's cool.

609
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,120
Hey, guys.

610
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,040
- Kenickie, Zuko.
- How's it hangin'?

611
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,170
OK, the meeting is in session.

612
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,180
Know what I heard? Last year the fuzz
had Thunder Road staked out.

613
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,610
- Everyone got hauled to the clink.
- No one'll catch Greased Lightning.

614
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

615
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,410
- Somebody snaking you, Danny?
- Bite the weenie, Rizz.

616
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,450
With relish.

617
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,790
- I don't know about these chicks.
- They're only good for one thing.

618
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:23,550
What do you do with 'em
the other 23 hours 45 minutes a day?

619
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,130
Does it only take 1 5 minutes?

620
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,230
Want some new music?

621
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,030
- Yeah.
- I'll need some money.

622
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,900
Thanks.

623
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,030
(wolf whistles)

624
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,950
I'll be right back.

625
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,250
Hi, Danny!

626
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,930
- I can't talk.
- What are you doing later?

627
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,630
- I can't talk, alright?
- Call me.

628
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,560
- Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi.

629
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,940
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

630
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,540
That's good.

631
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,160
Sandy, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

632
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:24,290
- What about?
- About the night at the bonfire.

633
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,790
The way I acted, that was terrible.

634
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,130
It wasn't me, you gotta know that.

635
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,830
It was me, of course,
but it wasn't me.

636
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,220
You see, Sandy,
I got this image, right? And...

637
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,770
That's why I'm so glad
that Tom's such a simple person.

638
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,690
Simple's right.
Too bad his brains are in his biceps.

639
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,410
Jealous, are you?

640
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,990
Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy,
don't make me laugh.

641
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,330
What have you ever done?

642
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,790
Come on! I can run circles
around those jerks.

643
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,090
I'll believe that when I see it.

644
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,450
Let's start with the first rule. Cut
it down to two packs a day. There.

645
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,710
What sort of athletics
are you interested in?

646
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,930
You like the rings?

647
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,270
Yeah, I installed a set
just a couple of weeks ago.

648
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:54,310
The first thing we have to do
is you have to change.

649
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,570
That's why I'm here, to change.

650
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,030
- No, I mean your clothes.
- Oh.

651
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,790
Alright. Let's knock it off.

652
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,620
Fellas, I wanna introduce a new man.
Danny. Let's give him a tryout.

653
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:20,890
- Better watch it.
- Come on. A little fire, here we go.

654
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,530
You have to dribble.

655
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,160
- Here you go, Coach.
- Thanks, son.

656
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,660
Dribble the ball,
put it in the basket.

657
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:47,790
- Think you can do that?
- Can I do that!

658
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,960
- OK.
- Danny, over here. Danny!

659
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,640
Let's go.

660
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,970
That's it. Go, go, go.

661
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,390
Get him, Danny.

662
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,610
- (whistle)
- What'd I do?

663
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,490
- Is he kidding?
- Boy, oh, boy.

664
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:16,450
I want you to meet
your wrestling partner. Danny, Andy.

665
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,040
Are you crazy?

666
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,370
Come on, come on.
Let's start. Get in first position.

667
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,750
Danny, you get down.

668
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,260
OK, Andy, get down. Ready?

669
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,640
(whistle)

670
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,350
Hold it, hold it.

671
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,100
Danny, you gotta try. Come on.

672
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,310
Alright, Andy, let's change
positions. You get down. Come on.

673
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,330
Alright. Ready?

674
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,170
(whistle)

675
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,120
- Give?
- Yeah, give.

676
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,580
Good.

677
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,720
He's a hitter.

678
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,350
You'll like baseball. It's not
that much of a contact sport.

679
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,940
Get in there and let's see
what you can do.

680
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,020
Throw the ball. Let's play.

681
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,310
Let's pitch this guy out.

682
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,200
- He can't hit.
- This boy can't even bat.

683
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,330
- Strike.
- I told you. He doesn't even swing.

684
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,160
What kind of ball player are you?
Put it in here.

685
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,500
Strike.

686
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,550
Come on. A little fire in there.
Let's see you hit it.

687
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,550
Foul ball.

688
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,560
- Easy, easy.
- Now! Come on.

689
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,850
Put the bat down. Put the bat down.

690
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,070
There's a lot of other sports
that don't have any contact.

691
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,910
- Yeah, like what?
- Like track.

692
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,540
- What do you mean, running?
- Just like running?

693
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,870
I mean something
that needs endurance.

694
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,800
Something that needs stamina.
Like, long-distance running.

695
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,170
Cross-country running.

696
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,760
- That could be cool.
- Good.

697
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,960
Danny.

698
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,170
Danny, are you alright?

699
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:56,140
Danny, talk to me.

700
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,720
The least you can do is talk to me
after the way you treated me.

701
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,650
The way I... ?
Sandy, I told you I was sorry.

702
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,520
Got you talking.

703
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,700
- You sure you're OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

704
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,290
- So, still dating that jockstrap?
- Well...

705
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:19,500
- Is he taking you to the dance?
- Well, that all depends.

706
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,170
- On what?
- On you.

707
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,260
- On me?
- Yeah.

708
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,090
He can stag it.

709
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,560
Come on.

710
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,180
(horn)

711
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,230
(music plays in background)

712
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,660
- Sandy, let's go someplace else.
- Why?

713
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,830
We can't be alone here, that's why.

714
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,540
Danny.

715
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,840
OK.

716
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,770
You nearly pulled my arm out.

717
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,980
I didn't want to miss this table.
It's the best one.

718
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:14,150
- What are you doing?
- I just want privacy.

719
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,700
- What'll it be, kids?
- Cherry soda, please.

720
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,780
- Danny?
- I'm not very hungry.

721
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,290
Give me a double polar burger with
everything and a soda with ice cream.

722
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,460
Sounds good. I'll have the same.

723
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,750
The same? You can eat a lot.

724
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,250
- You're funny.
- No, you are.

725
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,630
- How ya doing, Zuke? Nice!
- Hiya, Rizzo. How are you?

726
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,920
Peachy keen, jelly bean.

727
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,600
You got any quarters?
We could split an Eskimo Pie.

728
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:45,980
- My Dutch treat days are over.
- You plan on staying home a lot.

729
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,730
Greetings, pals and gals.
Anybody got 23 cents?

730
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,320
Wanna chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight?

731
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:56,700
I don't know where my money goes.
A dime here, 1 5 cents there.

732
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,950
In a couple of months
Frenchy can take us all out.

733
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,830
A working girl with income.

734
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,050
Y'know, they don't pay
that much to start with.

735
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:09,220
It's more than we make. Ante up,
I don't get my allowance till Friday.

736
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,840
- You get an allowance?
- When I'm a good boy.

737
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,550
Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight
with four spoons.

738
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,560
- And an Eskimo Pie with a knife.
- Hi, gang.

739
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,640
Here you are. Grab it and growl.

740
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,070
I got so many hickeys
I look like a leper.

741
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,250
Cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie
is like a Hallmark card.

742
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,610
You care enough
to send the very best.

743
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,540
- You pig.
- I love it when you talk dirty.

744
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,880
My parents want to invite you
to tea on Sunday. Will you come?

745
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,260
- I don't like tea.
- You don't have to drink tea.

746
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,180
Well, I don't like parents.

747
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,980
- Want some?
- Erm, uh-uh.

748
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,070
You sure are a cheap date.

749
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,230
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I understand.

750
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:05,870
- I always found you understanding.
- I am.

751
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,910
I also think
there's more to you than just fat.

752
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,750
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

753
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,920
- Got a date for the dance-off?
- No.

754
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,250
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

755
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:21,090
I'll be a senior forever if
I don't study for that algebra test.

756
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,090
You're in luck.
You got an armed escort home.

757
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:28,390
It's not the arms I'm worried about,
Sonny. It's the hands.

758
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,520
She loves me.

759
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,860
- You coming, French?
- I don't think so.

760
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,070
- I think I'll hang out a bit longer.
- Alright.

761
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:43,080
I have been dieting all day long. My
mom's apple pie's better than this.

762
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:45,450
- Do you want a piece?
- Yeah, sure.

763
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,870
- Putzie.
- Yeah?

764
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,630
1 5 minutes!

765
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,380
I'm worried about this dance-off. Do
they dance differently to back home?

766
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:59,130
Don't worry.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.

767
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,100
Let's get out of here, Sandy.

768
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,770
See you later.

769
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,680
- Bye, Frenchy.
- See ya, Sandy.

770
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,530
Great. I'm stuck with the check.
Give me money.

771
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:18,440
OK, what's with you tonight?
You got the personality of a wet mop.

772
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:22,660
- Don't start with me.
- Fine. How about I finish with ya?

773
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,460
Finish this!

774
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,050
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

775
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,800
Sorry, French.

776
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,230
(distant) Hey, Rizzo.
I want to talk to you!

777
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,230
No use crying over spilt milk shake.

778
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,110
Oh, I'll be OK.

779
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,870
You know it's near closing time?

780
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,070
Do you mind if I stay a bit longer?

781
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:55,200
No, suit yourself.

782
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,790
- Wow.
- What?

783
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,290
I hate to tell you, but your
hair looks like an Easter egg.

784
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, yeah.

785
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,470
Well, I had a little trouble
in tinting class.

786
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,880
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.

787
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,350
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it'd be.

788
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,060
Nothing ever is.

789
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:26,530
Vi? Erm, ... I dropped out.
What do you think of waitressing?

790
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,620
You're too young to know.

791
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,170
Maybe I could be
a telephone operator.

792
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:37,170
No, I don't think I'd like to wear
those little things over my ears.

793
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:43,010
God, if only I could have a guardian
angel to tell me what to do.

794
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,760
Like Debbie Reynolds had in Tammy.
What do you think?

795
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,530
If you find him,
give him my phone number.

796
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,500
# Your story's sad to tell

797
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,080
# A teenage ne'er-do-well

798
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:20,760
# Most mixed-up non-delinquent
on the block

799
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,600
# Your future's so unclear now

800
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,980
# What's left of your career now?

801
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:39,330
# Can't even get a trade-in
on your smock

802
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,840
# Beauty school dropout

803
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,140
# No graduation day for you

804
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,320
# Beauty school dropout

805
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,820
# Missed your midterms
and flunked shampoo

806
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:11,040
# Well, at least
you could have taken time

807
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,280
# To wash and clean your clothes up

808
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,820
# After spending all that dough

809
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,000
# To have the doctor fix your nose up

810
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,090
# Baby, get movin'

811
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,670
# Why keep your feeble hopes alive?

812
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,810
- # What are you provin'?
- # What are you provin'?

813
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,350
# You've got the dream
but not the drive

814
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,480
# If you go for your diploma

815
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:39,530
# You could join a steno-pool

816
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,690
# Turn in your teasing-comb

817
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,820
# And go back to high school

818
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,500
# Beauty school dropout

819
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,960
# Hangin' around the corner store

820
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,920
# Beauty school dropout

821
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,050
# It's about time you knew the score

822
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,890
# Well, they couldn't
teach you anything

823
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,090
# You think you're such a looker

824
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,680
# But no customer would go to you

825
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,440
# Unless she was a hooker

826
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,530
- # Baby, don't sweat it
- # Don't sweat it

827
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,920
# You're not cut out to hold a job

828
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,160
- # Better forget it
- # Forget it

829
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,380
# Who wants their hair done
by a slob?

830
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:36,040
# Now your bangs are curled,
your lashes twirled

831
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,850
# But still the world is cruel

832
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,130
# Wipe off that angel face

833
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:43,590
# And go back to high school

834
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,020
# Baby, don't blow it

835
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,700
# Don't put my good advice to shame

836
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,860
# Baby, you know it

837
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,450
# Even Dear Abby would say the same

838
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,910
# Now, I've called the shot,
get off the pot

839
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,590
# I've really got to fly

840
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:13,550
# Gotta be going to that malt shop

841
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:20,140
# In the sky

842
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,490
# Beauty school dropout

843
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,150
# Go back to high school

844
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:33,830
# Beauty school dropout

845
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,580
# Go back to high school

846
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:40,170
# Beauty school dropout

847
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,340
# Go back to high school

848
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,570
- Lower your head, Kenickie.
- What are you doing?

849
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,070
- Give him a break.
- Oh, I will!

850
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,770
No, we'll work on the brakes later.

851
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:06,570
Move over, slick.

852
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,660
Fruitcake, you got it on backwards.

853
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,460
- What car did you swipe it from?
- Your mother's.

854
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,470
Rizz.

855
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,270
Can you believe it?
Nationwide television!

856
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,860
- How you doing?
- Still gonna go to the dance?

857
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:41,160
Man, I'm gonna have
the hottest date there.

858
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,790
Biggest thing to happen to Rydell
and we don't have dates.

859
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,920
- Maybe Rudi from the Capri Lounge?
- Get serious.

860
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,670
- It's a suggestion.
- I already called him.

861
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,100
Relax. I think our luck is changing.

862
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,070
Do you know what you're doing?

863
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,350
What we're doing. Come on.

864
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,980
Hey, Marty. Lookin' good.

865
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:48,440
Would you just excuse me one second?

866
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,240
Feelin' good, too, huh?

867
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,950
Sonny. There he is. Vince Fontaine.

868
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,240
I seen better heads on a mug of beer.

869
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:03,250
- Grow up. He's the living end.
- Yeah, if you like older guys.

870
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,190
Danny, this is so exciting.

871
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,990
You gotta make friends
with the cameraman.

872
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,270
- You know him?
- His name's Ted.

873
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,120
Doody, how do I look?

874
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,910
Like a beautiful blonde pineapple.

875
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,870
You're late, fellas. Where you been?

876
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,420
- The gym never looked so good.
- You bring the provisions?

877
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,790
Alright, kids. I want a big circle.

878
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Come on, boys and girls,
we are going on the air very shortly.

879
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:53,320
But first, some warm-up numbers
with Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

880
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:06,250
# Oh, baby, rock'n'roll
is here to stay, it will never die

881
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:11,250
# It was meant to be that way,
though I don't know why

882
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:16,380
# I don't care what people say
Rock'n'roll is here to stay

883
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:21,060
# We don't care what people say
Rock'n'roll is here to stay

884
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,230
# Everybody rock, everybody rock

885
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,730
# Everybody rock, everybody rock

886
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:32,440
# Come on

887
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,400
# Everybody rock

888
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:39,410
# If you don't like rock'n'roll,
think what you'd be missin'

889
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,200
# If you like to bop and stroll,
come on down and listen

890
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,710
# Let's all start to have a ball

891
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,130
# Everybody rock'n'roll

892
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:00,680
- What are their names?
- Fred and Ginger.

893
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,610
Fred and Ginger.

894
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:30,720
- I hope I don't get camera fright.
- Don't worry, we'll be cool.

895
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:32,720
- Yeah?
- Don't worry?

896
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,680
Good. Come on, let's go.

897
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,060
# What's that playing on the radio?

898
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,030
# Why do I start swaying to and fro?

899
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,860
# I have never heard
that song before

900
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,530
# But if I don't hear it any more...

901
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:54,830
Why not let me lead for a change?

902
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,000
I can't help it. I'm used to leadin'.

903
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,670
OK.

904
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:04,430
Doody, can't you
turn me around or something?

905
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,010
Don't talk, Frenchy.
I'm trying to count.

906
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,940
# A melody

907
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,720
# That's never the same

908
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:14,650
# A melody
that's calling your name...

909
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,780
Have you thought
of singing professionally?

910
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:19,950
# (off key) Come back to me-e-e

911
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,650
- # Please...
- Hey, Zuko! Zuke!

912
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:25,360
I want you
to meet Cha Cha di Gregorio.

913
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,790
- How you doing, baby?
- Fine.

914
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,000
Who is she?

915
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:33,340
They call me Cha Cha, cos I'm
the best dancer at St Bernadette's.

916
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:36,630
With the worst reputation.

917
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,750
Let's go, Sandy.

918
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:42,890
- Who's that girl?
- Just a girl I know, that's all.

919
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,740
Hi.

920
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,530
I'm Vince Fontaine.

921
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:57,700
Do your folks know
I come into your room every night?

922
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,990
Over KZAZ, that is.

923
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,200
I'm judging the dance contest.

924
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,050
I don't think I'm entered.

925
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:10,130
A knockout like you?
What's your name?

926
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,590
- Marty.
- Marty what?

927
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,140
Maraschino. You know, like in cherry.

928
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,550
- What are you doing?
- Washing my hands.

929
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,960
# You don't remember me

930
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,550
# But I remember you

931
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,470
# It was not so long ago

932
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,600
# You broke my heart in two

933
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:57,400
# Tears on my pillow

934
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,940
# Pain in my heart

935
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:03,400
# Caused by you,
you, you, you, you...

936
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:05,490
How do you know her?

937
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:09,030
Erm, she's an old friend
of the family, that's all.

938
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,360
# Love is not a toy

939
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,210
# When you find the one you love...

940
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,120
- Aren't you glad to be back?
- Oh, yeah.

941
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,930
Besides, blondes do have more fun.

942
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:24,590
# If we could start anew

943
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,760
# I wouldn't hesitate...

944
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,190
When I hear music,
I can't make my feet behave.

945
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,100
- Thinks she's Tinker Bell.
- Hush, Sonny.

946
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:38,150
# Pain in my heart

947
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,240
# Caused by you

948
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,030
# You-ou-ou-ou

949
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,740
Sshh.

950
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,120
The Rydell fight song!

951
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,200
When you are finished...

952
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:21,860
You will be happy to know that
I am not judging the dance contest.

953
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:29,660
I think we all owe
a round of applause

954
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,420
to Patty Simcox and Eugene Felznik
and committee

955
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,880
for their beautiful decorations.

956
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,140
Let's hear it for the toilet paper.

957
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:47,060
In a few moments, the entire nation
will be watching Rydell High,

958
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,440
God help us, and I want you all
to be on your best behaviour.

959
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,570
No heinie-biting.

960
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,990
And now, here he is,

961
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,950
the Prince of the Platters,

962
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:01,540
Mr Vince Fontaine.

963
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,850
Mr Vince Fontaine?

964
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,230
(drum rolls)

965
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,590
Hey, it's great being here
at Rydell High.

966
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,760
What's your name, sweetheart?

967
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,180
And now, for the rules.

968
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:55,100
Game rule one.
All couples must be boy-girl.

969
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,360
Too bad, Eugene.

970
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:02,070
Alright, alright. Come on.

971
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,070
Game rule two.
During the dance contest,

972
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:10,630
if you're tapped on the shoulder,
leave the floor, or else. I mean it.

973
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:13,790
And rule three,
anyone doing tasteless

974
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,260
or vulgar movements
will be disqualified.

975
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,300
That leaves us out.

976
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,520
Keep it clean, please. Keep it clean.

977
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:27,940
20 seconds.

978
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:31,520
Thank you, fans and friends.
Now a few words to the wise.

979
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,310
You are my best pals.

980
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:37,360
To look your best for the contest,
just have a ball, that's all.

981
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,740
Forget the camera, keep on the beat,

982
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:43,320
give the folks at home a treat.
Keep dancin', that's showbiz.

983
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:46,210
If I tap you, step aside.
Let the others ride.

984
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,160
Ten seconds. Nine, eight,

985
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,880
seven, six, five, four,

986
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:56,380
three, two, one. On the air.

987
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:00,760
Welcome to National Bandstand,
live from Rydell High School.

988
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,680
This is what you're waiting for,
the dance-off.

989
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:07,230
Away we go with
Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

990
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:11,520
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

991
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,700
# Cryin' all the time

992
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,910
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

993
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,740
# Cryin' all the time

994
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,880
# You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

995
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,960
Look. There's the camera!

996
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,810
That's Putzie and Jan.

997
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:52,160
# Said you was high class,
that was just a lie

998
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:57,530
# Call yourself high class,
that was just a lie

999
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,950
# Well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit...

1000
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:03,720
Oh, there's Danny and Sandy.

1001
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,890
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

1002
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,470
# Cryin' all the time

1003
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,060
# Cryin' all the time

1004
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:16,890
# You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

1005
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,320
(song ends)

1006
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:26,120
Now the event you've all been
waiting for, the national dance-off.

1007
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:29,200
Some guy and gal will get
some fantabulous prizes.

1008
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:32,830
Don't feel bad if I tap you out.
It don't matter if you win or lose,

1009
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,720
it's what you do
with your dancin' shoes.

1010
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,330
Does everybody here know Marty?

1011
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:43,970
OK, cats, throw your mittens
round your kittens. Away we go!

1012
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,470
That wasn't supposed to happen!

1013
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:53,100
Let's go, let's hand-jive!

1014
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:57,490
# Before I was born late one night

1015
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,910
# My papa said everything's alright

1016
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,040
# The doctor made my ma lay down...

1017
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,540
Guy with the girl in red,
throw 'em out.

1018
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,800
# Cos the bebop stork
was about to arrive

1019
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,050
# Mama gave birth to the hand-jive

1020
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,590
# I could barely walk
when I milked a cow

1021
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,560
# When I was three I pushed a plough

1022
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:25,320
# While choppin' wood
I'd move my legs

1023
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,490
# And I started dancin'
while I gathered eggs

1024
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:32,410
# Townsfolk clapped, I was only five

1025
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:35,110
# I'd outdance 'em all,
I was born to hand-jive

1026
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,960
Yes, split 'em, buddy.

1027
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,710
Go, go, go, go.

1028
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,800
Shake it. Shake it.

1029
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,830
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1030
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,430
Attagirl!

1031
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1032
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:55,770
Everybody!
# Born to hand-jive, baby

1033
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:59,930
# Born to hand-jive, baby

1034
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,480
Here we go.

1035
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,400
Hey, break it up! What is that?

1036
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1037
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:16,950
C'mon now, shake it!

1038
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,460
Yeah.

1039
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:20,920
Twist it!

1040
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,390
Alright, get it!

1041
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,840
# How low can you go?

1042
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,720
# How low can you go?

1043
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,430
# How low can you go?

1044
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,020
There you go!

1045
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,140
C'mon now, hand-jive!

1046
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:09,710
That's the stuff!

1047
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:14,390
Do it, baby!

1048
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,100
Do it!

1049
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,570
That's the hand-jive grand-jive!

1050
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,770
Yeah, let's bring it up now!

1051
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:55,310
Bring it on up!

1052
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,400
Higher!

1053
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:01,110
Higher.

1054
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,740
Higher and higher!

1055
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,500
# Now can you hand-jive, baby?

1056
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:12,000
# Oh, can you hand-jive, baby?

1057
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,340
# Oh, yeah

1058
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,710
# Born to hand-jive, oh, yeah!

1059
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:22,680
Oh, yeah!

1060
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,970
Here they are, the new champs.

1061
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,260
Come on up here.

1062
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:33,400
- Can I have your names, please?
- Cha Cha di Gregorio and Danny Zuko.

1063
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,820
- We'll do it now.
- Where's Marty?

1064
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:40,410
- Don't worry, she's in good hands.
- Whose?

1065
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:46,040
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.

1066
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,880
- # Blue moon
- # Blue, blue, blue, blue moon

1067
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:55,840
# You saw me standing alone

1068
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:02,940
# Without a dream in my heart

1069
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:09,190
# Without a love of my own...

1070
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:13,480
Ready? One, one, two, three, go.

1071
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,860
# Blue moon...

1072
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,790
Who's that on the right?

1073
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,300
We have pictures
of you so-called mooners.

1074
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:30,890
Just because it's not your faces
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

1075
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:35,060
At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington,

1076
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:40,390
where the FBI has experts
in this type of identification.

1077
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:45,270
If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.

1078
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,850
C'mon, Doody. Watch your hands.
Move it out.

1079
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,350
I feel like a meatball in here.

1080
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,600
Let's go find the chicks.

1081
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,150
Marty. Marty.

1082
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:26,490
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.

1083
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:29,910
- I'm not hungry.
- Hey. What's happening?

1084
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:33,250
There's nobody here.

1085
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:40,140
Come on, Sandy.
I told you on the phone I was sorry.

1086
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,470
- I know you did.
- You believe me, don't you?

1087
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,800
Yes, but I still think
you and Cha Cha went together.

1088
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,770
We did not go together.
We just went together.

1089
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,900
- It's the same thing.
- No. No.

1090
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,100
- (screams)
- Ohh!

1091
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,890
Sandy, I'm sorry.

1092
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,020
Sandy...

1093
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,570
Would you wear my ring?

1094
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,160
Danny. I don't know what to say.

1095
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,370
- Say, yes.
- Yes.

1096
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:49,420
Danny, this means so much to me.
Cos I know now that you respect me.

1097
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:58,680
Hey, Rizz?

1098
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:00,230
Watch it.

1099
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,230
- What's with you tonight?
- I feel like a defective typewriter.

1100
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,940
- I skipped a period.
- You think you're PG?

1101
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,530
I don't know. Big deal.

1102
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:12,530
- Was it Kenickie?
- Nah, you don't know the guy.

1103
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,460
Rizz, look, it's OK.

1104
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:18,500
I caught Vince Fontaine putting
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.

1105
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:19,630
Hey.

1106
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,630
- Marty, you won't tell no one?
- Sure, I'll take it to the grave.

1107
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:32,140
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.

1108
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,470
Hey, Marty, what's up?

1109
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:39,440
Rizzo's pregnant.

1110
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,160
Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

1111
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:00,300
Rizzo's knocked up.

1112
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,560
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

1113
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:09,890
You do?
Boy, good news really travels fast.

1114
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:12,820
Why didn't ya tell me about it?

1115
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:15,110
What's it to ya?

1116
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,360
- I might be able to do something.
- You did enough.

1117
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,250
I don't run away from my mistakes.

1118
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:27,450
Don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.

1119
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,920
Thanks a lot, kid.

1120
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:37,630
Any time.

1121
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:45,770
- (sneezes)
- Are you getting a cold?

1122
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,560
No. It's probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.

1123
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,290
- Danny!
- Sandy! Oh, Sandy...

1124
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,460
Danny, what are you doing?

1125
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,750
Don't worry, nobody's watchin'.

1126
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:13,300
- Get off me.
- Sandy, what's the matter with you?

1127
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:17,050
I thought I meant something to you.

1128
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:22,400
Think I'm gonna stay with you in this
sin-wagon? Take this piece of tin!

1129
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,850
Sandy, you can't walk out
of a drive-in!

1130
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,540
# Stranded at the drive-in

1131
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,130
# Branded a fool

1132
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:46,470
# What will they say

1133
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,640
# Monday at school?

1134
01:23:58,190 --> 01:24:00,230
# Sandy

1135
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,440
# Can't you see

1136
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:05,280
# I'm in misery?

1137
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,790
# We made a start

1138
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,070
# Now we're apart

1139
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:14,410
# There's nothing left for me

1140
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:17,750
# Love has flown

1141
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,760
# All alone

1142
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:24,020
# I sit and wonder why-aye-aye

1143
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:27,560
# Why you left me

1144
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:30,390
# Oh, Sandy

1145
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,230
# Oh, Sandy

1146
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,440
# Maybe

1147
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:38,320
# Someday

1148
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:41,570
# When high school is done

1149
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,530
# Somehow, some way

1150
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:50,580
# Our two worlds will be one

1151
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,760
# In heaven

1152
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,930
# Forever

1153
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:59,470
# And ever we will be

1154
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,850
# Please, say you'll stay

1155
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:07,180
# Oh, Sandy

1156
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:13,140
Sandy, my darling,

1157
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,320
you hurt me real bad.

1158
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:18,450
You know it's true.

1159
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:22,210
But, baby, you gotta believe me
when I say...

1160
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,040
...I'm helpless without you.

1161
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,000
# Love has flown

1162
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,960
# All alone

1163
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:35,140
# I sit, I wonder why-aye-aye

1164
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:39,100
# Why you left me

1165
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:42,440
# Oh, Sandy

1166
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:46,610
# Sandy

1167
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:51,190
# Sandy

1168
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:59,330
# Why-aye-aye-aye?

1169
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:02,880
Oh, Sandy!

1170
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,560
Head it out. Come on, guys.

1171
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:18,810
Well, the crate shaped up.

1172
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:22,280
- It's as hot as the parts on it.
- We didn't steal all of it.

1173
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:26,030
- Some of it was donated.
- Just wait till Thunder Road.

1174
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,740
Right. You could still
change your mind.

1175
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:32,540
- The flag is in three hours.
- And Greased Lightning strikes.

1176
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:35,500
- You coming?
- My boys won't let me down,

1177
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,500
and I won't let them down.

1178
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:42,290
I wanna talk to you.

1179
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,970
Those guys at Thunder Road
don't fool around, you know.

1180
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,020
You want me to punk out?

1181
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,400
No, I'm not saying punking out,
I'm just...

1182
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,740
You know what I mean.

1183
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,280
Hey, Danny, erm...

1184
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:03,570
We been friends a long time, right?

1185
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,870
Yeah.

1186
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,750
You remember the drive-in
the other night?

1187
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,380
The movie with the duel,
the guy's best friend went with him

1188
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:15,630
as his lieutenant, his second?

1189
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,590
Yeah. So?

1190
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:24,260
Well, I thought that... you could
maybe be my second at Thunder Road.

1191
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,770
What, you want me
to drive with you or what?

1192
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:41,950
Listen, I'll pick you up at three,
alright?

1193
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,540
Open up the door.
What are you sitting around for?

1194
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:49,680
Take the can off
the front of the car, you putz.

1195
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:58,850
Hello, Rizz.
Are you going to Thunder Road?

1196
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,310
Not a chance.

1197
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,600
I have to go.
I have to talk to Danny.

1198
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:06,070
Without wheels and a motor,
he won't know you're alive.

1199
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,900
We haven't been friends,
but if there's anything I can do...

1200
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:14,080
I can take care of myself.
And anybody else who comes along.

1201
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,370
You think I don't know
what people are saying about me?

1202
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,160
Hey.

1203
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,090
Thanks.

1204
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:38,280
That's the one
I was telling you about.

1205
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,480
# There are worse things I could do

1206
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:47,870
# Than go with a boy or two

1207
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,320
# Even though the neighbourhood

1208
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,630
# Thinks I'm trashy and no good

1209
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:58,510
# I suppose it could be true

1210
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:02,880
# But there are worse things
I could do

1211
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:08,520
# I could flirt with all the guys

1212
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:15,810
# Smile at them and bat my eyes

1213
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:21,990
# Press against them when we dance

1214
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:25,540
# Make them think they stand a chance

1215
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:28,950
# Then refuse to see it through

1216
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:32,710
# That's a thing I'd never do

1217
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:38,550
# I could stay home every night

1218
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:44,390
# Wait around for Mr Right

1219
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:50,570
# Take cold showers every day

1220
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,570
# And throw my life away

1221
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,330
# On a dream that won't come true

1222
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:04,620
# I could hurt someone like me

1223
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:12,550
# Out of spite or jealousy

1224
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:17,550
# I don't steal and I don't lie

1225
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:21,020
# But I can feel and I can cry

1226
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:25,280
# A fact I'll bet you never knew

1227
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:33,410
# But to cry in front of you

1228
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,420
# That's the worst thing

1229
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:42,590
# I could do

1230
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,640
- You guys think you got a winner?
- That's right.

1231
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:33,860
Takes more than a coat of paint
on Thunder Road.

1232
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:37,100
- Oh, yeah?
- Not thinking of changing your mind?

1233
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:40,070
- No way.
- Good. Cos we're racing for pinks.

1234
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,700
Pinks?

1235
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,400
Pinks, punk.
Pink slips. Ownership papers.

1236
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:51,000
Stop. Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

1237
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:54,550
Hey, get the dude, man.

1238
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:05,560
- What did she give him?
- A lock of hair. From her chest.

1239
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,890
Poor Kenickie.

1240
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:16,570
See a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

1241
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,530
Gimme that.

1242
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,950
If it were in any better condition,
it would fly.

1243
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:28,250
- She's gonna.
- I brought you this for good luck.

1244
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:29,710
Gee, thanks.

1245
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,550
- I'm sorry.
- I'll get it.

1246
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:39,180
You putz!

1247
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:42,150
Put this under his head.

1248
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:46,820
- Zuko, he's out cold.
- What are we gonna do?

1249
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:50,030
Kenickie. Talk to me, buddy.

1250
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:52,200
You OK?

1251
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,450
Yeah. I'm OK.

1252
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:57,330
I'm fine. (groans)

1253
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:00,870
- You can't drive.
- No, really, I'm alright.

1254
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,160
I'm just seeing two of you, man.

1255
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:08,380
- Hey, you want me to drive for you?
- Huh?

1256
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:11,010
Yeah. Yeah.

1257
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:13,350
Alright. Help him up.

1258
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:16,600
Marty, give me a hand.

1259
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:25,110
(car engines start)

1260
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:33,120
Hey.

1261
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,460
The rules are, there ain't no rules.

1262
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:38,460
To the second bridge and back.
First one back wins.

1263
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:41,960
Haul ass, kid.

1264
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,860
You ain't gonna see me
for dust, Zuko.

1265
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:38,030
Come on, baby.

1266
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:30,210
# For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1267
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:34,550
# For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny

1268
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:39,050
# Look at me

1269
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:42,180
# There has to be

1270
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:44,680
# Something more

1271
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:47,600
# Than what they see

1272
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:50,850
# Wholesome and pure

1273
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:54,520
# Oh, so scared and unsure

1274
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:59,400
# A poor man's Sandra Dee

1275
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:00,870
Danny won.

1276
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,450
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

1277
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:08,120
What's the matter? Aren't you happy?

1278
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:12,300
Not really. But I think I know a way
I could be. Could you help me?

1279
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:15,050
- Of course.
- Can I come to your place?

1280
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:16,810
Sure. Come on.

1281
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:26,400
# Sandy, you must start anew

1282
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:31,530
# Don't you know what you must do?

1283
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,900
# Hold your head high

1284
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:38,420
- # Take a deep breath and sigh...
- Come on, Sandy.

1285
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:40,540
# Goodbye

1286
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:46,840
# To Sandra Dee

1287
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,360
Attention, seniors.

1288
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:07,610
Before the merriment
of commencement commences,

1289
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:10,950
I hope your years with us here
at Rydell High

1290
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,170
have prepared you
for the challenges you face.

1291
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:18,920
Who knows, among you, there may be
a future Eleanor Roosevelt,

1292
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:21,460
or a Rosemary Clooney.

1293
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:23,920
And among you young men,
there may be

1294
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:27,390
a Joe DiMaggio,
a President Eisenhower

1295
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,390
or even a Vice President Nixon.

1296
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:35,560
But always you will have
the glorious memories of Rydell High.

1297
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:38,610
Rydell forever. Bon voyage.

1298
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,820
(chimes)

1299
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,740
Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering.

1300
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:54,580
(cheering)

1301
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,630
- How many?
- One.

1302
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,390
(bell rings)

1303
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:38,850
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

1304
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:40,520
How did I flunk phys ed?

1305
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,220
Did I take phys ed?

1306
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,310
Step right up here!
It's for a wonderful cause.

1307
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:51,990
The Teachers' Retirement Fund.
Give 'em a pie in the puss.

1308
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,360
Coach, how could you flunk
the T-Birds?

1309
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:58,450
Don't worry. You'll get diplomas.
Just come back to summer school.

1310
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:01,040
- Summer school?
- Look out!

1311
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:06,720
If you'd come to class,
you wouldn't have missed me.

1312
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,250
Wise guy, huh? Take that, Coach!

1313
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:13,550
Why, you couldn't pitch one inning.

1314
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,720
- What's your name? I want you.
- Eugene.

1315
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:23,570
- You're a great pitcher.
- Thank you.

1316
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:36,130
Rizzo! Rizzo!

1317
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:38,660
Get off of that. You got a condition.

1318
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:42,630
Forget it. It was a false alarm.
I'm not pregnant.

1319
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,390
Whoo-hooo!

1320
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,090
I'Il, erm,
make an honest woman of you.

1321
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:53,930
Listen, fella, if this is a line,
I ain't biting.

1322
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:56,560
That's a bona fide offer.

1323
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:59,360
Well, it ain't moonlight and roses,
but...

1324
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:11,040
- Hey, there's Zuko.
- You gotta be kidding, man!

1325
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:17,120
- What is this? Halloween?
- Where did you swipe the sweater?

1326
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:21,050
While you tools were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.

1327
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:23,890
I can't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock?

1328
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:27,220
- That's right, I did.
- What you doing? Deserting us?

1329
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,230
You guys can't follow a leader
all your lives.

1330
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:34,610
Come on, you know you mean
a lot to me, but Sandy does, too.

1331
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:37,110
I'm gonna do anything I can
to get her.

1332
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,570
(wolf whistles)

1333
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:50,670
Sandy?

1334
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:54,040
Tell me about it, stud.

1335
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:04,150
# I got chills

1336
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:06,230
# They're multiplyin'

1337
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:11,030
# And I'm losing control

1338
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,200
# Cos the power

1339
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:15,320
# You're supplyin'

1340
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:17,860
# It's electrifyin'

1341
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:26,460
# You better shape up

1342
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:29,250
# Cos I need a man

1343
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,710
# And my heart is set on you

1344
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,840
# You better shape up

1345
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,770
# You better understand

1346
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,470
# To my heart I must be true

1347
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:45,110
# Nothin' left,
nothin' left for me to do

1348
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,860
- # You're the one that I want
- # You are the one I want

1349

# Oh, yes indeed

1356
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:11,930
# If you're filled with affection

1357

# You're too shy to convey

1358
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:20,990
# Meditate in my direction

1359
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:24,110
- # Feel your way
- Wow!

1360
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:27,660
# I better shape up

1361
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:31,210
