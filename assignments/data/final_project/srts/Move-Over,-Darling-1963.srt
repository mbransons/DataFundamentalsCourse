1
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,241
Order. Quiet!

2
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,213
Order. Order.
There's too much noise in here.

3
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,807
What? Never mind who's making the noise.

4
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,876
I want it quiet in here.

5
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,116
<i>And you down there</i>—
<i>stop that whispering!</i>

6
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,852
This is a court of law,
not a public library.

7
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,224
Oh, sorry, Your Honor.

8
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,786
Uh, are the parties present
in the matter...

9
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,855
of Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden?

10
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,032
<i>Mr. Nicholas Arden?</i>

11
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,098
- Present.
- I don't want to bother with this.

12
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,644
It looks too complicated.
Let it wait.

13
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,975
Wasn't I supposed to marry
some people?

14
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,709
- Where are they? Wasn't that for today?
- If Your Honor please—

15
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,047
Just be still.

16
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,179
Aren't you the party that was doing
all that whispering down there?

17
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,519
- Well—
- Just be quiet.

18
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,617
What do you mean, "the same fellow"?
This is a petition.

19
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,185
- Well, his wife is the one that—
- Oh, really?

20
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,254
Where does it say that?

21
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,662
Well, what do you know about that?

22
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,103
- Are you, uh, Nicholas Arden?
- Yes, Your Honor.

23
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,370
- I am, Your Honor.
- Aren't you represented by counsel?

24
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,776
I'm a member of the bar, Your Honor.
I'm presenting my own case.

25
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,337
Oh, trying to save yourself
a buck or two, huh?

26
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,249
Here. "Airplane crash
in Pacific Ocean."

27
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,119
Uh, yes, sir. My wife was aboard the plane
that was forced down in the storm.

28
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,123
It's been five years, Your Honor.

29
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,455
This is a petition
to have her declared legally dead.

30
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,155
Is that what it says in here?

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,358
- Sorry, sir.
- Not at all. It was very nice of you to tell me.

32
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,095
Now let's see what <i>I</i> can find.

33
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,070
"Ellen Wagstaff Arden.

34
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,538
Two infant children."

35
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,236
Oh, how tragic.

36
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,507
That's sad. Very sad.

37
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,947
Two little babies, and you let her
fly off to a watery grave?

38
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,008
Well, we both flew off, Your Honor.

39
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,077
Uh, I had business in Australia.

40
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:19,454
She'd had so much trouble with the children—
the teething and all— that I took her with me.

41
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,459
Yes, it says so here.

42
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,361
Let's see.
"En route from refueling stop...

43
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,797
forced down in rough seas."

44
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,030
Let's see here. "Life raft."

45
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,503
Young woman...

46
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,067
<i>would you stop jangling those cowbells?</i>

47
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,170
You mean these, Your Honor?

48
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:45,149
If I hear one more jingle jangle,
I'll really get after you.

49
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,085
<i>There's such a thing</i>
<i>as contempt of court, you know.</i>

50
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,214
- Weren't you in the same life raft?
- Well, no, sir.

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,816
The women took the first rafts.
The men took what were left.

52
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,884
We were all separated
during a storm.

53
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,692
- It's all right here in the brief.
- Keep your hands out.

54
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,368
Is something wrong, Your Honor?

55
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,600
Yes, there's plenty wrong.
My arthritis is killing me.

56
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,905
And your jabbering isn't helping me
get out of here any faster.

57
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,741
- Now, just stick to the facts.
- They're in my brief.

58
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,077
Then stop interrupting
and let me read them!

59
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,709
Is there any proof of loss?

60
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,946
Uh, page seven, I believe.

61
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,682
I see.

62
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,725
Oh, that's page four, Your Honor.

63
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,285
I know it's page four.
It says "page four" right here.

64
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,766
Oh, yes. Here it is. It's page seven!

65
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,138
Any depositions?

66
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,265
Uh, they begin here on page—

67
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,602
Where'd you study law anyway?

68
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,443
- Harvard, sir.
- Yeah? Might have known.

69
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,449
A Yale man myself.

70
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,111
Well, let's see. "Husband"—

71
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,918
Your Honor will see that there is, uh,
no opposition to this petition.

72
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,981
And all survivors agreed that, uh—

73
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,028
- "Said Ellen Wagstaff Arden
had been swept overboard—
- Swept overboard...

74
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,030
"Before aid could reach her.

75
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,032
- Deposition appended."
- Quiet!

76
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,591
- Well, I'd like to explain, sir.
- There's nothing to explain.

77
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,899
Testimony is here. Sworn affidavits.

78
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,962
No evidence to the contrary.

79
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,974
The law is clear.

80
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,910
I hereby pronounce
Ellen Wagstaff Arden legally dead.

81
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,106
Wasn't I supposed to marry somebody?

82
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,149
Yes, Your Honor.

83
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,150
- Us.
- What? Already?

84
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,715
Well, it's been five years, Your Honor.

85
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,091
Five seconds in the eyes of the law.

86
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,029
Your wife wasn't dead
until I said she was dead.

87
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,862
Sure you don't want more time
to think about it?

88
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,370
- Oh, I'm sure he doesn't.
- I didn't ask you, young lady.

89
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,770
Your interruptions have been
prolonging this case...

90
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,003
and causing me extreme mental
and physical discomfort.

91
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,173
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I know how painful arthritis can be.

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,240
Oh, you do?
Do you know the kind I've got?

93
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,445
Where your bones begin to crumble
like old peanut brittle?

94
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,513
Has Your Honor
ever considered psychotherapy?

95
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,184
Are you one of those couch nuts?

96
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,161
Well, if you mean psychoanalysis...

97
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,460
surely Your Honor doesn't discount
the contributions Freud has made...

98
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,728
to the relief of human suffering.

99
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,930
Freud's dead,
probably from arthritis.

100
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,463
Now, just be quiet, if that's possible.

101
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,533
Well, are you gonna
answer the question...

102
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,841
or is she going to talk for you
the rest of your life?

103
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,478
- I've forgotten the question, Your Honor.
- Darling, he asked you—

104
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,713
Uh-uh-uh!

105
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,982
I asked if you wanted
to marry this woman.

106
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,388
Why, certainly, Your Honor.

107
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,485
Harvard man.

108
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,864
Can we have some pictures, Captain?
This is front-page news.

109
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,667
- Five years on a desert island.
- Mrs. Arden! Mrs. Arden!

110
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,731
- Where you going?
- I've got to call my family.
Where's the nearest phone?

111
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,801
- Oh, the booth's over there, Mrs. Arden.
- Thank you.

112
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,905
- Oh! Does anybody have a nickel?
- Phone calls are a dime now.

113
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,314
- A dime? Why?
- Stamps are a nickel.

114
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,716
- Oh.
- Would you like for me to make the call?

115
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,278
- Break the news to them for you?
- Oh. Uh—

116
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,847
Five years.
It may be a bit of a shock to them.

117
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,656
Thank you very much, Captain,
but if you don't mind, I'd like to.

118
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,969
This is the greatest Navy rescue since we
fished Gordon Cooper out of the drink.

119
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,272
- You have dialed an incorrect number.
- Oh, Operator, are you sure—

120
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,011
Please be sure that you are calling
the right number and are dialing correctly.

121
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,417
- I know it's right, Operator.
- This is a recording.

122
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,285
- I-It's my home.
- You have dialed an incorrect number.

123
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,291
Crestview 5-4699 in—

124
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,850
Be sure you are calling the right number
and are dialing correctly.

125
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,091
- But it is the right number. It's always been our—
- This is a recording.

126
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,394
You have dialed an incorrect—

127
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:06,242
- Operator.
- Operator, I'm dialing Crestview 5-4699...

128
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,304
and a recording said that
I have dialed an incorrect number.

129
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,045
I know it's the correct number because for the
past eight years we have had the same number.

130
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,451
Crestview 5-4699...

131
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,183
is now 275-4699.

132
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,249
275-46— Oh! Whatever it is,
would you please get it for me?

133
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:26,287
- Thank you.
- You may dial 275-4699 direct.

134
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,198
- 275—
- 4699.

135
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:33,261
- Thank you.
- The area code is 213.

136
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,671
- What's the area code?
- 213.

137
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,675
213.

138
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,678
- You may dial 275-4699—
- Wait.

139
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,237
By first dialing 213.

140
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,753
213-275-4699.

141
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,913
213-475—

142
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:55,325
- No. 213-275-4699.
- Oh!

143
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:59,228
- Oh!
- Would you care to make a note of that?

144
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,789
Operator, would you just
wait a minute, please?

145
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,801
Does anyone have a pencil?

146
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,202
We can drive you home a lot faster
than you can get that call through, ma'am.

147
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,332
- Would you? Thank you.
- The navy's pleasure.

148
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,571
- Oh, but first we'd like to get some pictures.
- Pictures?

149
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,944
For the newspapers. Mrs. Arden,
you're a real public interest story.

150
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:20,076
Oh, no. Please don't.
No, I'd like to see my children first.

151
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,519
- Uh, y-you do understand that.
- Well, of course.

152
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,320
It'll be enough of an adjustment they'll
have to make without the worid looking on.

153
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,987
You take all the time you need,
Mrs. Arden.

154
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,326
- After all, this is the silent service.
- Thank you.

155
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,663
<i>- We have a car waiting for you,</i>
<i>Mrs. Arden, right this way.</i>
- Oh, good. Excuse me.

156
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,206
Oh, Dr. Schlick was so right.

157
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,609
I'm really ready for a ripe,
mature relationship now.

158
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,671
Is that why you married me?

159
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,412
- Just a prescription from your analyst?
- Don't be silly, darling.

160
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,977
I can hardly wait to get to Monterey.

161
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,023
Uh, you'll have to.

162
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,787
The State Highway Commission frowns
on commencing a honeymoon in a vehicle.

163
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,852
- Hmm?
- It's a moving violation.

164
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,001
Thank you very much.

165
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,115
Thank the whole United States Navy!

166
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,831
<i>- It's your turn.</i>
<i>- I can beat you!</i>

167
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,874
<i>- No, you can't!</i>
- Yes, I can!

168
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,910
- You missed! You missed!
- I did not.

169
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,969
<i>You did too.</i>
<i>You stepped right on the crack.</i>

170
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,413
I did not. Anyway, you made me.

171
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,713
<i>You have to start over again.</i>

172
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:04,119
<i>You splashed water in my eyes.</i>
<i>No fair!</i>

173
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,802
Stop splashing.

174
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,861
<i>That's no fair.</i>

175
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,887
- Hello.
- Hello.

176
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,691
- Hi.
- Shh.

177
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,818
I'm walking a tightrope.

178
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,692
Oh, well, I see you are,
and you're doing very nicely.

179
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,857
Who are you?

180
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,631
I don't think you remember me,
but I remember you.

181
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,570
Are you a lady or a man?

182
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,478
- I used to be a lady.
<i>- Are you a sailor?</i>

183
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,480
Well, not really, no.

184
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,608
Some sailors helped Daddy
look for our mother once.

185
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,675
She drowned, in the ocean.

186
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,483
- Did she?
<i>- Long time ago.</i>

187
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,719
We're the only one in our whole school
who has a "drownded" mother.

188
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,732
Would you like to have her back?

189
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,994
Can't have her back. She's "drownded."

190
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,096
Like this— glug, glug, glug.

191
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,348
Um, tell me something.
Do you miss her?

192
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,717
Every Easter, Daddy takes us
to put flowers on her grave.

193
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,722
Her grave?

194
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,782
Don't be sad. She's not in the grave.

195
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,352
She's at the bottom of the ocean—
the deepest part.

196
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,660
Oh, I know.

197
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,724
Tell me about your school,
what you do and everything.

198
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,260
We're not supposed
to talk to strangers.

199
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,365
L— I'm not really a stranger.
I know your daddy.

200
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,774
- Our grandma too?
- Yes.

201
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,372
- She's inside.
- Well, first I wanted to see you.

202
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:14,078
- What for?
- Because I heard that you were both so pretty.

203
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,880
And you are so pretty.

204
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,958
Are you gonna cry?

205
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,660
She was crying, that lady.

206
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,400
- She was not.
- She was so.

207
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,374
<i>Aw, she's just goofy.</i>

208
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,773
<i> You'll find a chicken</i>
<i>in the freezer, Maria...</i>

209
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,911
and-and that is what
we are going to have for dinner.

210
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,922
- Freezer?
- In the freezer.

211
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,083
<i>- żFrío?</i>
- A chicken for dinner.

212
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,127
żSabe?

213
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,961
Listen carefully, Mari—

214
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:01,619
We're going to have chicken,
you know?

215
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:03,631
- Chicken.
- "Cheeken."

216
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:07,191
<i>- ˇAh, sí, sí, seńora!</i>

217
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:10,261
<i>- Pollo. Bueno.</i>
- Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

218
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,701
And there will be a man.

219
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:15,709
<i>- Un hombre.</i>
<i>- żHombre?</i>

220
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:17,745
- Come here<i>. Aquí.</i>
<i>- żAquí?</i>

221
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:20,213
To wash the windows.

222
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:22,546
<i>żSabe</i> "wash windows"?

223
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:25,610
- "Weendows"?
<i>- Sí.</i> "Weendows."

224
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,988
Wash the "weendows."

225
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,458
Oh. Here he is now.
I'll tell him myself.

226
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:36,656
I want him to start in the den.
And, Maria, you go get the <i>pollo.</i>

227
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:45,638
If you'll just follow me, I'll show you
where I want you to start.

228
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,107
<i>Grace.</i>

229
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:50,974
Now, don't get scared.

230
00:15:52,214 --> 00:15:54,148
Grace!

231
00:15:55,217 --> 00:15:57,151
Grace, darling?

232
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,551
Grace, darling, are you all right?

233
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:03,182
I'm sorry. For a minute
I imagined my daughter-in—

234
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:05,192
Yeah.

235
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,923
Oh, Grace! No!
Grace, don't do— Oh, Grace.

236
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:12,398
Grace. Oh, dear.

237
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:23,603
Grace? Grace!

238
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,614
Oh.

239
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:33,252
Oh! Oh!

240
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:36,018
Oh, Grace. Oh, Grace, I'm sorry.

241
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,025
Oh, Grace!

242
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:41,756
Oh, good heavens. It's true.

243
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,663
- Oh. Oh.
- Ellen, you're alive.

244
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:48,066
Yes, darling, I am. I am.

245
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:50,468
Oh, come on. Let me help you up.

246
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:54,532
Oh, I tried to call you
to break it to you gently...

247
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:56,975
but I-I couldn't get through.

248
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,979
Oh, I'm sorry.

249
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:01,709
Oh, I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

250
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:04,775
- Pinch me.
- Oh. Maybe I'd better get you a sip of brandy.

251
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:06,980
Make it a fifth.

252
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:09,182
- Ellen!
- What?

253
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,589
Where have you been?

254
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,652
On an island in the Pacific
and then on a submarine.

255
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,460
- Submarine?
- I'll tell you about it later.

256
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:21,161
But first, tell me, how's Nicky?

257
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:25,596
Nicky.

258
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:28,507
Grace? What is it?
He's all right, isn't he?

259
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:30,568
- Nicky's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

260
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:33,443
- Nicky's just fine.
- Oh.

261
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,710
Well, then what are you crying about?

262
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:41,449
Well, it's gonna be such a shock to him
to find out you're back.

263
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:45,186
Oh, I know it is, and we've got to
figure out a way to tell him.

264
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,252
- Yes.
- What am I gonna do?
Maybe I should call the office.

265
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,321
- Oh.
- I want to call him right now.

266
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:53,391
Uh, no! No, don't.

267
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:56,403
- Don't call him?
- Well, he's not there.

268
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,496
- Oh, are you sure?
- I'm sure.

269
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:02,407
- Oh. Where is he?
- Uh, have you seen the children?

270
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:04,741
Oh, yes, when I came in.

271
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,509
Oh, Grace.

272
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:10,073
Oh, they're so beautiful.

273
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:12,177
Did they recognize you?

274
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:16,520
Of course not, and I didn't know
how to tell them without Nicky.

275
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:21,392
- Where is he?
- Uh, perhaps first you'd better take a bath.

276
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:23,693
- I don't want a bath!
- Well, take one anyway.

277
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:27,257
- Grace, what's the matter with you?
- Matter?

278
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:30,793
- Are you hiding something from me?
- Hiding? Oh!

279
00:18:30,872 --> 00:18:34,205
Me? Don't be silly.

280
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:37,643
Uh, maybe I'd better
get <i>you</i> that drink.

281
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:40,806
You know perfectly well
I don't drink.

282
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:44,613
- You will.
- Grace!

283
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:48,984
What are you trying to tell me?

284
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,991
Let me do that.

285
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,050
Now, what happened?

286
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:55,062
Um, Ellen...

287
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:58,122
Nick's married.

288
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:04,966
I'm sorry, dear.

289
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,974
I'm so sorry.

290
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:24,081
<i>Ellen, you know...</i>

291
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,560
Nick loves you more
than anything in the worid.

292
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:30,928
And nobody dreamed that you—

293
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:43,076
Five years is a long time, darling.

294
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,581
Can't expect a healthy man
to wait forever.

295
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,381
Just how long did he wait?

296
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:56,049
Until this morning.

297
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:58,354
<i>This</i> this morning?

298
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,417
Yes, about—

299
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:03,826
Ellen, you're not too late.

300
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,595
- Come on.
- Grace, what are you doing?

301
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:09,466
Calling the airline,
get you out on the next flight.

302
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:13,338
- What flight? Where?
- You'll be at the hotel before they arrive.

303
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:17,401
- I can't do that, Grace!
- Why can't you? You're his wife.

304
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,777
- So is she.
- She's his bride.

305
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,873
- What's the difference?
- A honeymoon.

306
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,249
And you're not
gonna let them have one.

307
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,914
But first we gotta find you
something to wear...

308
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:30,856
then I'll call
for the next flight to Monterey.

309
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,860
- Monterey?
- Yeah.

310
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:36,091
- You mean he's taking her to our hotel?
- Yes.

311
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:38,894
Doesn't that make you fighting mad?

312
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:48,108
Oh, no.

313
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,077
I think that's terribly sweet.

314
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:57,118
Oh, brother. You have been away.

315
00:20:57,185 --> 00:21:00,177
Oh, we had such
a lovely honeymoon there.

316
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:01,882
Come on!

317
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,323
Oh, I'm sorry.

318
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,061
Keep the change.

319
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:44,963
- Uh, yes, ma'am?
- Pardon me. Has Mr. Nicholas Arden arrived yet?

320
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,627
- Oh, we're expecting him shortly.
- Oh.

321
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:50,330
- Would you like to leave a message?
- Oh, no, thank you.

322
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,896
I'd rather surp— I'll just wait.

323
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,339
No, please. Leave the makeup kit
straight up, quickly.

324
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:42,651
I believe you have
a reservation for me—Arden.

325
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:44,851
Oh, yes. Mr. Nicholas Arden.

326
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:46,860
And Mrs. Arden.

327
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:50,056
Mr. And Mrs. Arden,
how very nice to have you with us.

328
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:52,361
- Thank you, sir.
- Suite "A," I believe.

329
00:22:52,434 --> 00:22:57,371
<i>- Yes, Mr. Codd.</i>
- "A"? Don't you have something else?

330
00:22:57,439 --> 00:23:01,671
- Well, it's our very best.
After all, the honeymoon—
- I know, but I can't.

331
00:23:01,743 --> 00:23:04,473
I mean, I'd rather not.
You must have something else.

332
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:08,209
"C." It's not quite as large,
and it hasn't been redecorated as late—

333
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,217
I'll take it.

334
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:14,449
Boy.
Suite "C" for Mr. And Mrs. Arden.

335
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:16,456
Thank you.

336
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:18,515
<i>Oh, uh, Mr. Arden.</i>

337
00:23:20,228 --> 00:23:25,222
I, uh—Well, it's not that I have
anything against Suite "A."

338
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,461
I've been there before. You know.

339
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:23,216
- That'll be all. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

340
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,321
<i>Uh, would there be anything else, sir?</i>

341
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,800
<i>Uh, no. No, thank you. That's all.</i>

342
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,803
- Uh—
- Thank you, sir.

343
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:39,135
- Thank you, sir!
- Good evening, Mr. Arden.

344
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:41,368
Shall I serve this on the terrace?

345
00:24:41,443 --> 00:24:44,640
Hey. What's that?

346
00:24:44,712 --> 00:24:48,204
- Who ordered the champagne?
- There's a message, sir.

347
00:24:57,492 --> 00:25:00,825
- Where is she?
<i>- She's down in the cocktail terrace, sir.</i>

348
00:25:09,103 --> 00:25:11,901
Oh, darling. Champagne!

349
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:13,907
How sweet.

350
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:15,966
I- I thought you might like some.

351
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:19,036
As if we really needed it.

352
00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:21,741
Will there be anything else, sir?

353
00:25:21,816 --> 00:25:25,650
- Uh— Darling, I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

354
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,188
- I have to get some change.
- Oh, darling.

355
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:30,816
We can take care of that later.

356
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:34,123
Oh, of course.
Uh, enjoy the champagne. Good evening.

357
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:40,358
His...

358
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:42,426
and hers.

359
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:44,438
To us.

360
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:50,836
Darling, I'm the one who's supposed
to be nervous. I'm the bride.

361
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:53,312
Well, that's what makes me nervous.
I- I mean—

362
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:56,111
Sweetheart, l— I need some cigarettes.
I better go get some.

363
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:58,414
- I've got some cigarettes in the bedroom.
- Filter tips?

364
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:00,477
- Yes.
- Can't stand filter tips.

365
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:02,546
Oh, I'll snip them off for you.

366
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,616
Uh, honey, i-it's—
Well, I need a shave.

367
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:08,355
Oh, such a compulsive
flight from reality.

368
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:11,193
- You don't need a shave.
- I do.

369
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:13,530
Y— It relaxes me.

370
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:16,229
All right then.
You shave here, and I'll watch.

371
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:18,795
Like Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

372
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:21,808
It's not the shave, Albert—
I mean, it's the massage.

373
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:24,640
It's what they do to your face
with their fingers.

374
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:28,546
Well, I have fingers too.

375
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:35,586
But not hot towels!
I'll be right back.

376
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:38,820
From the barber stairs—
Down shop— Stairs!

377
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:57,707
- Oh, my dear. Don't push me.
- I'm sorry.

378
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,770
Don't push me.

379
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:09,289
<i>Ellen?</i>

380
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:23,003
Ellen?

381
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,310
Oh, Ellen, it is! Yes.

382
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:35,115
Oh, darling.

383
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:39,686
That's all I wanted to know.

384
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:41,688
Oh!

385
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:55,162
- Oh, Ellen. I couldn't believe—
- Hold me, darling.

386
00:27:56,437 --> 00:27:58,803
Good Lord, Ellen. What happened?

387
00:27:58,873 --> 00:28:01,103
We searched for you.
We looked for you.

388
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:04,110
- How did you—What—
- Nicky.

389
00:28:04,178 --> 00:28:08,740
I can't tell you about five years
in two seconds, darling.

390
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:19,483
Besides,
you have much more to tell me.

391
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,996
Oh, you know about Bianca.

392
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:25,862
- Oh, Nicky, how could you?
- How could I?

393
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:28,868
- The minute my back was turned.
- The minute? Well—

394
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:31,598
I thought you loved me.
All those years—

395
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:33,664
You know I love you.

396
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:37,100
Oh, Nicky.

397
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:39,669
We have such problems, don't you?

398
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:43,440
- Problems?
- Yes.

399
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:45,486
What about..."Binaca"?

400
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,818
- Bianca.
- Bianca.

401
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,552
It's all right, sweetheart.
I'll take care of everything.

402
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:55,519
How, darling?

403
00:28:55,596 --> 00:28:57,655
Well, simple. I'll just tell her.

404
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:02,868
- When?
- Well—

405
00:29:02,937 --> 00:29:05,633
Well, first,
before we do anything else...

406
00:29:05,707 --> 00:29:07,698
we better get you a room.

407
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:35,594
- Yes, Mr. Arden?
- I'd like a room, please.

408
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,695
Yes, of course—

409
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:40,263
- Another room?
- Yes.

410
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:43,967
Darling, do you think that maybe—

411
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,036
Is Suite "A" available?

412
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:48,048
Suite "A"?

413
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,711
- Suite "A"?
- Yes.

414
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:57,917
I believe Suite "A" is unoccupied,
isn't it?

415
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,358
Suite "A."

416
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:02,589
Boy.

417
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,401
Thank you.

418
00:30:09,604 --> 00:30:11,970
I'd like to know
what he thinks he's doing.

419
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,202
- I'd like to know how he does it.
- Y—

420
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:22,807
Barbershop?
Mr. Nicholas Arden, please.

421
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:25,375
Oh?

422
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:27,944
Well, how long has he been gone?

423
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:32,192
Well, he must have been there.

424
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,251
Are you sure?

425
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,464
Thank you.

426
00:30:52,346 --> 00:30:54,280
Operator?

427
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,044
- Hello.
- Operator, would you page Mr. Arden, please?

428
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,198
Mr. Nicholas Arden.

429
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:03,197
Thank you, Mr. Arden.

430
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:14,601
Oh! Oh, my darling!

431
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:57,950
- Nicky. Now, don't, Nicky.
- Darling.

432
00:31:58,022 --> 00:32:01,014
Now, please don't take advantage of me
just because I'm a woman.

433
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:04,323
- Oh, you're my wife.
- One of them.

434
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:08,126
Yeah. I really have to
do something about that.

435
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:10,690
- Yes.
- I really do.

436
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:12,929
- When?
- Hmm?

437
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:15,301
When?

438
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:18,205
Well, it-it— it won't be easy.

439
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:21,369
Uh, it's going to take
a great deal of diplomacy...

440
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:24,175
tact, finesse.

441
00:32:24,248 --> 00:32:26,512
She's a very emotional girl.

442
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:28,518
When?

443
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:31,180
Well, I need a little time, Ellen.

444
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:33,746
After all, she married me
in good faith.

445
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:37,385
She expects the marriage to last longer
than six hours, you know.

446
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:39,395
Nicky?

447
00:32:40,464 --> 00:32:42,455
I want to ask you something.

448
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:45,959
Are you in love with her?

449
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:48,368
I love you, and you know it.

450
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:51,101
- But you must have told her you love her.
- Huh?

451
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:53,666
Didn't you, when you proposed?

452
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:56,235
Oh. Oh, well.

453
00:32:56,313 --> 00:33:00,306
- Of course you did!
- Well, I suppose, but I never stopped loving you.

454
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:02,579
You stopped long enough
to get married!

455
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,644
You have to see
the whole picture, darling.

456
00:33:04,722 --> 00:33:07,953
- I saw the whole picture, and she's very pretty.
- All right. She's pretty!

457
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:11,017
Well, if you had really loved me,
you'd have married an ugly girl.

458
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:14,087
For crying out loud, Ellen,
how did I know you were still alive?

459
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:18,067
I couldn't take a chance on getting stuck
with an ugly girl the rest of my life.

460
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:24,367
Yes?

461
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:27,239
Oh. Yes. It's for you.

462
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:33,216
Hello.

463
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:37,015
Mr. Arden, you are being paged
all over this hotel.

464
00:33:37,087 --> 00:33:39,578
I believe Mrs. Arden
is trying to locate you.

465
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:43,184
- O-Oh. Thank you.
- Shall I put the call through there?

466
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,423
No, no! Don't put it through here.
No. I-I'll call her.

467
00:33:46,497 --> 00:33:48,522
Please see that you do.

468
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,362
Yes, thank you.

469
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:58,475
Front desk. Mr. Codd.

470
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:01,943
Haven't you got a detective or someone
who can find my husband, Mr. Codd?

471
00:34:02,012 --> 00:34:03,946
Or must I call the police?

472
00:34:04,014 --> 00:34:06,005
No. No, no. No, no, no, no.

473
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:09,109
No, I'm sure he's here in the hotel somewhere.
Believe me, we'll locate him.

474
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:12,622
Well, would you please hurry?
I'm terribly concerned!

475
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,955
I assure you, madam,
I am just as concerned as you are.

476
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:25,126
Nicholas!

477
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:28,228
It's the maid. Do you want me
to turn down the bed?

478
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:31,172
Get out. Get out! Get out! Get out!

479
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:34,234
Sweetheart, you don't understand.

480
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:37,610
A man can't just bust in
on the woman he's just married...

481
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:40,411
and tell her that his dead wife
has come back.

482
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:44,818
He certainly can, if he loves
his dead wife who's come back.

483
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,823
<i>If</i> he loves her?

484
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:51,653
Now, that hurts, Ellen.
That really hurts.

485
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:57,567
Y- You wouldn't say that...

486
00:34:57,635 --> 00:35:01,696
if-if you'd seen the memorial service
we had for you.

487
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:03,706
Memorial service?

488
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:07,433
There were over 200 people there.

489
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:14,311
It was the most beautiful service
that I've ever attended.

490
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:16,319
Really?

491
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:21,324
I—I-I sent a blanket of carnations...

492
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:23,519
that covered the whole altar.

493
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:27,463
Oh, Nicky.

494
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,963
What—What color?

495
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:34,266
Your color— pink.

496
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,800
Pink.

497
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,571
After the choir sang...

498
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:43,442
a hush fell over
the— the whole church...

499
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:46,813
as Dr. Slocum came forward
to deliver the eulogy.

500
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:51,044
What did he say?

501
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:53,214
Oh, what every one of us knew.

502
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,124
That you were an ángel on Earth...

503
00:35:57,194 --> 00:36:01,028
a wonderful mother, a devoted wife...

504
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:05,694
credit to the community...

505
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,760
and a darn good sport.

506
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,864
Oh, Nicky. Really?

507
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:12,875
Me?

508
00:36:12,943 --> 00:36:15,935
There wasn't a dry eye
in the congregation.

509
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:18,413
Oh. Gosh, I wish I'd been there.

510
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:23,450
If you had been there,
there wouldn't have been a service.

511
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:28,356
Oh! That's right.

512
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:30,825
Oh.

513
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:34,697
Uh, Nick.

514
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:39,792
Um, what about the, um...

515
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,963
insurance?

516
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:45,531
- What about it?
- It was $100,000, wasn't it?

517
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:47,668
No, 50. I'm a hundred.

518
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:50,976
Oh. Did you collect it?

519
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:52,982
Not yet.

520
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,451
You weren't legally dead
until this morning.

521
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,852
And you didn't claim it right away.

522
00:36:58,922 --> 00:37:01,550
Well, I never even thought about it.

523
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,856
Oh, Nicky. You do love me!

524
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:09,930
Oh, sweet—

525
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:18,063
- May I see you for a moment?
- Well, what is it?

526
00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:20,633
Mr. Arden, as a resident manager
of this hotel...

527
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:24,203
I find it my duty to inform you
that when a man takes a room here...

528
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:26,806
we expect him to go to that room
with his own wife.

529
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:29,682
<i>We do not expect that wife</i>
<i>to be paging him constantly...</i>

530
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:32,244
when he is next door
dallying with another woman.

531
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:35,849
<i>Dallying? Oh, he's not dallying.</i>

532
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:38,258
- Please, madam, do not interfere—
- Mr. Codd.

533
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:41,195
- We will not be made a party to intrigue.
- Oh, now wait a minute!

534
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:45,201
This establishment's maintained
a reputation for respectability for 25 years.

535
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,601
We do not intend
to lose it in one night.

536
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:51,368
<i>Well, you could lose more than your reputation</i>
<i>with that kind ofloose talk.</i>

537
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:53,376
Loose? My dear sir...

538
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:55,935
as a hotel manager
of many years experience...

539
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:58,777
I can sniff hanky-panky
in an air-conditioned building.

540
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:01,181
Hanky-panky? You get out of here.

541
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:04,243
I am leaving. I am leaving.
There's only one thing we ask.

542
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:07,381
That you restrict yourself
to one suite, one wife.

543
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,790
- That's the American way.
- Right.

544
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,387
- Ellen!
- I absolutely agree.

545
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:16,058
Oh? Fine.

546
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,124
Then you'll leave?

547
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:21,228
Leave? Why should I leave?
I'm Mrs. Arden.

548
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:23,239
- You are?
- Yes.

549
00:38:24,508 --> 00:38:26,601
Tell him, darling.

550
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:34,516
And you allowed your husband to register
in this hotel with another woman?

551
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:37,019
- Why do you think I'm here?
- Oh, Ellen. Stop it!

552
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:40,579
Unless I'm very much mistaken,
you registered the first one as Mrs. Arden...

553
00:38:40,657 --> 00:38:42,887
this one as Miss Wagstaff.

554
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,622
- He didn't think you'd notice.
- He—

555
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:50,656
I don't know what you two—
or you three— think you're doing...

556
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:54,397
but I insist that one of your women
leave this hotel at once!

557
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:57,031
Right. I absolutely agree.

558
00:38:57,107 --> 00:38:59,234
Ellen! Look, I'll explain.

559
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,573
It's really a very simple situation.

560
00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:04,136
You see, my wife— my bride—
She's my wife.

561
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:07,206
What my husband is trying to tell you
is that he has two wives.

562
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:09,775
- Yes!
- I don't care if he has 10 wives.

563
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:12,845
As long as he's in this hotel,
he will have only one wife—

564
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:15,915
the one that he registered here
as his wife— his first wife.

565
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:17,927
- His second wife?
- You're confused.

566
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,929
- Yes!
- I can explain it.

567
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:22,761
You do that, darling.
First him, and then to her.

568
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,994
- See you later, sweetheart.
- I'll be right back.

569
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:27,559
Not while I'm manager here.

570
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:39,005
I'll have to go down for the key.

571
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:46,820
- Mrs. Arden.
- Yes?

572
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,824
I found your husband.

573
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:52,259
It's certainly high time.
I'm awfully sorry I had to bother you.

574
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,264
Thank you very much. It was very—

575
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:58,631
Where have you been? I've never
been so humiliated in my whole life!

576
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:02,968
Oh, now, Bianca. I was down in the lobby,
and I ran into someone.

577
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,974
An old buddy.

578
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:08,705
I don't care who you ran into! Leaving me
here all alone for some old army buddy!

579
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:10,770
Navy. It was a navy buddy.

580
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:12,838
Oh, Nicholas!
You've been gone for hours.

581
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,907
It wasn't hours. Only a few minutes.

582
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:17,476
You just don't love me anymore.
I've been so miserable!

583
00:40:17,554 --> 00:40:20,546
- Now, please, Bianca, don't be so upset.
- How do you expect me to feel?

584
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:24,651
You're just like all the others. Every husband
I ever had— only thinking of themselves.

585
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:28,323
I was thinking of you.
The problem never left my mind.

586
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:32,300
"Problem"? Problem!
Now all I am to you is a problem!

587
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:35,600
Well, if that's all I am to you,
you can just go jump in the lake!

588
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:37,833
- Put that down, Bianca!
- Don't you bully me!

589
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:40,308
Making me call
all over the hotel for you!

590
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:42,868
You're selfish! That's what you are!
You're selfish, selfish, selfish!

591
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:46,677
- Lower your voice, Bianca.
- I don't care if the whole hotel hears me!
I hate you!

592
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,014
Hold it!

593
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:52,954
Oh, the poor thing. He told her.

594
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:55,184
Hold it!

595
00:40:55,259 --> 00:40:57,193
<i>I hate you.</i>

596
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:07,136
- Bianca, please.
- I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

597
00:41:08,472 --> 00:41:10,963
- Where are you going?
- Outside. Have a drink.

598
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,942
Nicholas, please don't leave me.

599
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:17,941
Don't you care about me anymore?

600
00:41:19,316 --> 00:41:22,911
Nicholas. Look at me.

601
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:29,150
How can you ignore me?

602
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:32,354
I'm not ignoring you.

603
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,920
I'd like to talk to you, but sensibly.

604
00:41:34,998 --> 00:41:37,831
Then you do still love me!

605
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:41,735
Oh, Nicholas, why do you always
make me feel so insecure?

606
00:41:41,805 --> 00:41:44,501
<i>Stop squirming, darling.</i>

607
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:47,407
<i>- I'm not squirming.</i>
<i>- Oh, poor baby's trembling.</i>

608
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:50,640
<i>I'm not</i>— <i>I'm not trembling.</i>
<i>Now, please, Bianca, don't do that.</i>

609
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:53,080
Oh, I can't help it.
You're so male. Hmm.

610
00:41:55,786 --> 00:41:59,847
<i>- No, please, Bianca, don't do that.</i>
<i>- I can't help it.</i>

611
00:41:59,923 --> 00:42:01,914
What was that?

612
00:42:01,992 --> 00:42:04,256
- Just noisy neighbors.
- Noisy?

613
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,762
Or nosy? Let's go inside.

614
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:11,562
- Good idea.
- To the bedroom.

615
00:42:11,635 --> 00:42:13,398
Don't you da—

616
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,404
What nerve.

617
00:42:15,472 --> 00:42:18,236
I think they're having a party over there.

618
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:20,799
Bianca. Bianca,
I have something to tell you.

619
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:24,335
- I just don't know where to begin.
- Why not begin in there?

620
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:26,405
Well, it won't be easy.

621
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:29,418
Oh, it will be
if you don't worry about it.

622
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:32,250
Bianca, my dear, life—

623
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:34,722
Life is very strange. Yes.

624
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:39,626
Uh, things that we don't expect
to happen sometimes happen when
we least expect them to happen.

625
00:42:39,696 --> 00:42:41,664
You know what I mean?

626
00:42:41,732 --> 00:42:43,825
<i>You don't know what I mean.</i>

627
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,529
Bianca, uh, marriage—
marriage is a very sacred state.

628
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:49,538
Oh, yes, darling.

629
00:42:49,606 --> 00:42:52,404
Yes, and a-a man's wife
means more to him...

630
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:55,445
than— than anything
in the worid means to him.

631
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:57,912
- Oh!
- Tell her.

632
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:00,347
- Trying.
- What?

633
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:03,011
I'm trying to say that— that a man—

634
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:05,213
When a man has one wife...

635
00:43:05,288 --> 00:43:08,018
a man should be faithful
to that one wife.

636
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:11,583
Oh, darling, I'll always trust you.

637
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:13,595
Let's go inside.

638
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:19,859
- Oh! Oh!
- What in heaven's name is going on over there?

639
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:26,531
- I'll go quiet them down.
- Oh, no, you don't.

640
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,738
You're not leaving me again,
not tonight.

641
00:43:37,788 --> 00:43:42,088
Now, you just get comfy, darling.

642
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,754
I'm comfy. It's just that
I wanted some champagne.

643
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:49,663
I'll get it, while you slip
into your pajamas.

644
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:06,138
- Good Lord, Ellen! Go away!
- What is going on?

645
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:08,776
- What is going on in there?
- I'm trying to tell her.

646
00:44:08,852 --> 00:44:11,013
- Oh, is that what you're doing?
- Yes!

647
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:13,146
<i>- Nicholas!</i>
- You—

648
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,020
- Bianca, l—
- You put your coat on again.

649
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:20,062
I had to answer the door.

650
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,257
Oh. Who was it?

651
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:24,266
- The maid.
- Again?

652
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:27,132
Oh, I'll turn the bed down myself...

653
00:44:27,204 --> 00:44:29,195
in a minute.

654
00:44:33,944 --> 00:44:38,244
- What a persistent woman!
- Yeah. I'll get it.

655
00:44:46,723 --> 00:44:49,715
Don't you— Don't you ever
slam that door in my face again.

656
00:44:49,793 --> 00:44:51,954
Lipstick! You kissed her!

657
00:44:52,028 --> 00:44:55,930
- She kissed me.
- Then why did you start to undress?

658
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:57,990
Ellen, things are tough enough as it is.

659
00:44:58,068 --> 00:45:00,559
Just give me time to soften her up.
Five minutes?

660
00:45:00,637 --> 00:45:02,571
Four.

661
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,821
Don't you think we should
order some dinner?

662
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,460
Oh, I'm not hungry... yet.

663
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:25,199
- Bianca, we have got to talk.
- In bed.

664
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:30,770
No!

665
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:34,305
All right. All right! Now let's talk.

666
00:45:34,384 --> 00:45:38,878
- With your clothes on?
- I can do it better with my clothes on, believe me.

667
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,923
Come on, darling. Take off your shirt.

668
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:47,986
- No, don't, Bianca. Don't. Don't, Bianca.
- Oh, darling. Come on.

669
00:45:48,064 --> 00:45:51,329
<i>No, Bianca. Bianca!</i>

670
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:53,335
- Now, don't.
- Oh, baby.

671
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:55,894
Now that's—
That tickles. Oh, don't!

672
00:46:02,078 --> 00:46:05,013
<i>Don't, Bianca. Don't, Bianca. Oh, now</i>—

673
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:08,881
Oh, don't!

674
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:13,455
Oh!

675
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,864
No. Don't! Bianca! No.

676
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,111
Bianca. Now—

677
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,876
Bianca, when I asked you to marry me...

678
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:42,509
conditions existed
of which I was not aware.

679
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:44,849
Therefore, well—

680
00:46:44,921 --> 00:46:47,913
Something very unusual
has happened to me. Well, to you.

681
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:50,551
To all of us!

682
00:46:50,627 --> 00:46:53,619
Oh, this hotel is impossible.
Not her again.

683
00:46:53,696 --> 00:46:57,393
It must be. It is!

684
00:46:57,467 --> 00:47:00,459
Nicholas! You come back here!

685
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:16,143
- What happened?
- I'm going to see the manager.

686
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:18,619
Nicholas?

687
00:47:21,557 --> 00:47:25,152
The next plane to Los Ángeles
is at 7:30.

688
00:47:25,228 --> 00:47:29,028
- You think I can make that?
- There are taxis just outside, Mrs. Arden.

689
00:47:29,098 --> 00:47:31,760
It's Miss Wagstaff.

690
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:34,029
<i>Uh, Ellen.</i>

691
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:38,005
- Ellen!
- The name is Seymour.

692
00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:40,201
Ellen, be reasonable.

693
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:42,437
You're being very unrealistic.

694
00:47:42,512 --> 00:47:44,503
Where do you think you're going?

695
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,048
Home to my children, where I belong.

696
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:49,607
Ellen, wo—would you
just wait a minute?

697
00:47:49,686 --> 00:47:51,847
To the airport, driver. Please hurry.

698
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:55,288
Ellen, darling, just give me
a little bit of time.

699
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,259
How much time do you need
to say, "My wife is alive"?

700
00:47:58,328 --> 00:48:00,956
Four little words!
Go practice them!

701
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,964
Driver, hurry.

702
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,731
"My wife is alive."

703
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:17,909
"My wife is alive. My wife is alive."

704
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:20,973
So's mine, buddy.
That's why I drink.

705
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:46,108
- Hello?
- Uh— Bianca?

706
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:49,702
Nicholas! Where are you?
What happened? Where did you go?

707
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:52,942
Sweetheart, I, uh—

708
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:55,007
Well, an important case came up...

709
00:48:55,084 --> 00:48:57,575
and I have to rush back
to Los Ángeles.

710
00:48:57,653 --> 00:49:02,590
Los Ángeles?
Oh, Nicky, you can't leave me now!

711
00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:05,422
Not tonight.
Please, darling. I need you.

712
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:08,658
I'm so alone and so confused.
Please come back.

713
00:49:08,731 --> 00:49:12,462
If you leave me now,
I'll just go completely to pieces!

714
00:49:18,408 --> 00:49:20,399
Your husband should be
old enough to know...

715
00:49:20,476 --> 00:49:24,071
how dangerous jumping
frisky young fillies can be.

716
00:49:31,854 --> 00:49:33,788
Oh, Doctor.

717
00:49:33,856 --> 00:49:36,586
Me? I'm not a doctor.
I'm an ambulance driver.

718
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:38,650
You're a doctor now.

719
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,438
Nicholas!

720
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:57,968
- Oh, Nicholas! What have you done to me?
- To you?

721
00:49:58,047 --> 00:50:00,845
Of all times to hurt your back.

722
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:06,019
Children, what are you doing up there?

723
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:08,182
<i>Nothing, Grandma!</i>

724
00:50:08,257 --> 00:50:10,350
Well, stop it this instant.

725
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:13,224
And get undressed and get into bed.

726
00:50:15,331 --> 00:50:17,322
You'd better get some sleep yourself.

727
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,732
You're wearing a trench in that carpet.

728
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:21,827
Oh, I could strangle him!

729
00:50:21,904 --> 00:50:24,395
Why not Bianca?
That would solve the situation.

730
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:27,739
It's not her fault. Nick is to blame!

731
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:30,643
I never want to speak to him again.
Never.

732
00:50:30,713 --> 00:50:33,341
- You oughta say a few words to him.
- Yeah.

733
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,407
While you're strangling him?

734
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:38,454
- Oh, Grace. This is not funny.
- I know, dear.

735
00:50:38,521 --> 00:50:40,512
He hasn't even called.

736
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:44,583
Well, he will. He'll do the right thing
at the right time.

737
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,152
The right time was three hours ago
in Monterey.

738
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:52,861
- Why didn't you tell her?
- Because it's not my place. It's his place.

739
00:50:52,935 --> 00:50:56,098
- And if he really loves me, he'll tell her.
- Don't be impatient.

740
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:58,572
Impatient? He's had hours!

741
00:50:59,942 --> 00:51:03,105
You had just as long
to tell the children who you are.

742
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:05,943
Oh, Grace, how can you
compare the two things?

743
00:51:06,015 --> 00:51:07,949
It's different with children.

744
00:51:08,017 --> 00:51:10,508
Why, think of the shock
it might have on them.

745
00:51:10,586 --> 00:51:13,384
Think of the shock it's had on my child.

746
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:16,448
Child? Ugh! Nick is not a child.

747
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:19,086
No. He's not that smart.

748
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:21,187
- Hmm.
- He's only a man.

749
00:51:21,264 --> 00:51:24,756
<i>- Grandma, we're ready!</i>
- Okay, giris.

750
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:26,768
Uh—

751
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:31,601
Why don't you go up and tuck them in?

752
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:49,024
Oh, Grace, I'm scared.

753
00:51:49,091 --> 00:51:52,322
For heaven's sakes, Ellen.
They're your own children.

754
00:51:52,395 --> 00:51:56,559
Yes, but they don't know that.
What can I say to them?

755
00:51:56,632 --> 00:51:59,999
Be natural. What did you used to do
when you put them to bed?

756
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:02,902
Read, sing,
tell them a bedtime story?

757
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:05,133
Do you remember any of them?

758
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:08,371
- Some of them.
- Maybe they will too.

759
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:16,147
<i>- Grandma!</i>
<i>- Grandma, we're ready!</i>

760
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:18,210
<i>- She did not!</i>
<i>- She did too!</i>

761
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:20,755
<i>- She did not!</i>
- She did too!

762
00:52:20,823 --> 00:52:23,485
Who did too... not?

763
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,550
Where's Grandma?

764
00:52:25,628 --> 00:52:27,596
Grandma's busy downstairs.

765
00:52:27,663 --> 00:52:30,063
She's supposed to tuck us in.

766
00:52:30,132 --> 00:52:32,100
I can do that.

767
00:52:32,168 --> 00:52:34,136
Really, I can.

768
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:38,765
I've tucked in lots of little giris in bed,
a long time ago.

769
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:41,401
I read them bedtime stories...

770
00:52:41,477 --> 00:52:43,468
sang 'em lullabies.

771
00:52:45,314 --> 00:52:47,282
And I kissed them good night.

772
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,341
Were they your little giris?

773
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:51,648
Yes.

774
00:52:53,189 --> 00:52:56,022
You gonna cry again?

775
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,993
Don't cry.
It's not hard to tuck us in.

776
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:03,031
All right.

777
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:06,500
Snuggle down,
and I'll tell you a story.

778
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:09,129
I want Grandma to.

779
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:12,606
- I know lots of stories.
- Which ones?

780
00:53:12,675 --> 00:53:14,836
Well, I know
"Little Red Riding Hood"...

781
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,378
and I know "Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs."

782
00:53:17,446 --> 00:53:19,676
Ah, that's just kid stuff.

783
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:22,718
Here.
Read <i>The Enchanted Bicycle.</i>

784
00:53:22,785 --> 00:53:26,318
I hate that. Bianca gave it to us.

785
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:28,943
Oh.

786
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:31,251
Well, let's see now.

787
00:53:32,725 --> 00:53:36,092
- I know a song.
- What kind of song?

788
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:39,221
A go-to-sleep song.
Let's see if you remember it.

789
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:42,790
No.
Read <i>The Enchanted Bicycle.</i>

790
00:53:42,868 --> 00:53:46,133
I wanna hear the song.
But first I have to go to the bathroom.

791
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:48,469
All right. Hurry up. Real fast.

792
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,941
She always has to go
to the bathroom.

793
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:54,479
Is that the phone?

794
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:57,208
Grandma'll get it.

795
00:53:59,618 --> 00:54:02,212
What's that?

796
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:05,086
This? It's a locket.

797
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:07,148
What's inside?

798
00:54:09,328 --> 00:54:12,491
Pictures of people I love most
in the whole worid.

799
00:54:12,564 --> 00:54:15,533
- Who?
- You want to see?

800
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:18,263
<i>Okay, I'm ready.</i>

801
00:54:18,337 --> 00:54:20,271
Okay.

802
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:22,273
Oh, dear.

803
00:54:25,344 --> 00:54:28,939
- Would you like to see the locket?
- Aren't you gonna sing?

804
00:54:29,014 --> 00:54:31,312
Oh. Yes.

805
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:35,839
Darling,
do you remember that song?

806
00:55:35,914 --> 00:55:39,475
<i>- I heard it someplace.</i>
- Where?

807
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:42,850
On the radio, I think.
I don't like it.

808
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:49,060
Are you gonna stay here?

809
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:51,358
Would you like me to?

810
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,660
Where would you sleep?

811
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:57,294
Well, in the guest room.

812
00:55:57,369 --> 00:55:59,496
Bianca's gonna sleep there.

813
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:04,702
No, she's gonna sleep in Daddy's room
because she's our new mother.

814
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:07,610
I don't want her to.

815
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,613
Don't you want a mother?

816
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:12,013
- No. Just Daddy.
- Yeah.

817
00:56:19,558 --> 00:56:21,549
Good night.

818
00:56:32,037 --> 00:56:33,971
Good night.

819
00:56:38,577 --> 00:56:41,978
Moo! Moo!

820
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:48,214
- Ah! <i>Leche.</i>
<i>- Leche.</i>

821
00:56:48,287 --> 00:56:51,654
<i>- Sí, seńora.</i>
- Grace. Grace.

822
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:54,521
You'd better start studying Spanish,
or learn to play charades.

823
00:56:54,593 --> 00:56:58,188
- Who was that on the phone?
- Oh. Yeah, sit down, Ellen.

824
00:56:58,263 --> 00:57:00,561
It was Nick.
He's not coming home.

825
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:03,692
- He is coming home.
- Well— Oh, then he told her.

826
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:06,863
- Grace, he told her.
- Actually, it was Bianca who called.

827
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:09,806
- Bianca?
- Now, don't get excited, honey.

828
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:12,708
Nick's had a little accident.
N- Nothing serious.

829
00:57:12,778 --> 00:57:15,440
- He hurt his back.
- His back?

830
00:57:16,782 --> 00:57:19,444
He could've slipped or something.

831
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:21,713
Well, he could have.

832
00:57:21,787 --> 00:57:23,846
And they'll be here
first thing tomorrow morning.

833
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:27,181
- You mean he's gonna bring that woman here?
- Shh!

834
00:57:27,259 --> 00:57:29,727
- In my house?
- Simmer down, Ellen.

835
00:57:29,795 --> 00:57:32,662
- You'll upset the children
and make a worse mess of things.
- Oh!

836
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:34,858
There must be some way
to handle this.

837
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:37,333
What do you want me to do,
hide in the attic?

838
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:40,496
Don't be silly.
There's a very simple solution.

839
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:43,837
- What?
- You can go to a hotel for a couple of days.

840
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:46,241
- I will not be thrown out of my own house!
- Shh!

841
00:57:46,311 --> 00:57:48,506
This is as much my house
as it is his.

842
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,605
- How can we explain your being here?
- Leche!

843
00:57:53,352 --> 00:57:57,652
<i>- Gracias.</i>
<i>- Por nada. Por nada. Por nada. Y por nada.</i>

844
00:57:57,723 --> 00:58:00,214
Why don't you let her go
and make me the cook?

845
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:03,819
Oh, I can think of some lovely dishes
to make for them.

846
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:06,922
No, dear. We'd better think
of something else.

847
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:25,611
Jenny! Jenny!

848
00:58:25,684 --> 00:58:28,118
You forgot your sweater!

849
00:58:28,187 --> 00:58:30,155
Oh, dear.

850
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,794
Ellen!

851
00:58:41,066 --> 00:58:43,000
Ellen?

852
00:58:44,236 --> 00:58:46,534
Ellen! They're here.

853
00:59:06,558 --> 00:59:10,153
For heaven's sakes, Nicky!
You look terrible.

854
00:59:10,229 --> 00:59:13,096
I feel terrible.

855
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:15,895
Well, don't you worry, Son.
We'll take care of you.

856
00:59:15,968 --> 00:59:17,902
Oh, I'll take care of him.

857
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:22,430
<i>No. I will be the one to take care.</i>

858
00:59:22,507 --> 00:59:25,442
- Who's that?
- Uh, that's Miss Svensson.

859
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,637
- Uh, she's Swedish.
- Svensson?

860
00:59:27,713 --> 00:59:30,648
Uh, the nurse I engaged for you.

861
00:59:30,716 --> 00:59:33,617
<i>Ja.</i> My name is Greta Svensson.

862
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:37,587
Is Swedish name. You call me Greta.

863
00:59:37,656 --> 00:59:40,022
Well, Nicholas doesn't need
a nurse, Mother Arden.

864
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:43,186
- I'm gonna call Dr. Schlick for him.
- The psychiatrist?

865
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:46,129
Oh, yes. I'm sure his trouble
is psychogenic.

866
00:59:46,198 --> 00:59:48,223
He has a deep-seated anxiety neurosis.

867
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,234
Deep-seated?

868
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:52,532
In his back?

869
00:59:52,604 --> 00:59:54,936
Well, you see, l—
I just had an accident.

870
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,101
I was running down some—well,
up some stairs— and I tripped and fell.

871
00:59:58,176 --> 01:00:00,644
- I had all my clothes on at the time!
- Uh, Nicholas, dear—

872
01:00:00,712 --> 01:00:03,374
It was early last night—very early—
just before dinner even.

873
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,939
Darling, you don't have to explain
anything to Miss Svensson.

874
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:08,748
- Oh, but I do. She's here to help me, isn't she?
- Oh, yes.

875
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,948
Ooh, <i>ja.</i>
And give good Swedish massage.

876
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:15,858
Don't worry, lady.
I fix his aching back. Uh, come.

877
01:00:15,927 --> 01:00:19,488
Uh, well, thank you. But first, would you
go out and bring our luggage in?

878
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:22,055
- Me?
- Well, of course you.

879
01:00:22,134 --> 01:00:24,102
Come, Nicholas.

880
01:00:25,437 --> 01:00:28,099
Darling, I've never seen
the bedrooms in this house.

881
01:00:28,173 --> 01:00:31,438
- How many have we?
- Not nearly enough.

882
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,640
Oh! I'll be right up, dear,
as soon as I call Dr. Schlick.

883
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:43,686
Just wait'll I get my hands on him.

884
01:00:43,755 --> 01:00:45,882
Now, now, Ellen. Temper, temper.

885
01:00:45,957 --> 01:00:48,687
Everything's working out just fine.

886
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,252
Fine? How dare she come in here
and order me around!

887
01:00:52,331 --> 01:00:56,097
I'll have a little talk
with her about your duties.

888
01:00:56,168 --> 01:00:58,830
And I'll have a talk with him about his.

889
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:03,102
Well, uh, when Dr. Schlick is free,
would you have him call me...

890
01:01:03,175 --> 01:01:07,839
at... 235-4505, please?

891
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,471
Thank you.

892
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:15,350
Mother Arden!
I thought the nurse was doing that.

893
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:20,119
She helped. But, uh, she's going
to give Nick his massage.

894
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:23,727
Oh, here, Ellen. Here.

895
01:01:23,795 --> 01:01:25,922
- Let's talk—
- You just keep away from me.

896
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:28,625
You had all night to tell her.
All night!

897
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,100
I've tried to tell her, believe me. L—

898
01:01:31,169 --> 01:01:34,104
- Here, would you get me out of this straitjacket?
- Let her get you out.

899
01:01:34,172 --> 01:01:37,232
- She got you into it.
- Nobody got me into anything.

900
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:41,040
Nothin' happened. Why do you think
I went to all this trouble?

901
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:43,206
- Faking a bad back!
- Faking?

902
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:46,182
I don't believe you.

903
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:48,776
Here. Does it look like
I've got a sprained back?

904
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:54,625
Nicholas!

905
01:01:56,862 --> 01:01:58,796
It works.

906
01:01:58,864 --> 01:02:01,298
- What works?
- Greta's massage.

907
01:02:01,366 --> 01:02:03,698
- So soon?
- Yeah, how about that?

908
01:02:03,769 --> 01:02:06,966
Oh, <i>ja.</i> Special Swedish massage.

909
01:02:07,038 --> 01:02:09,233
- Isn't she marvelous?
- Marvelous?

910
01:02:09,307 --> 01:02:11,241
It— It's almost a miracle.

911
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:13,869
Was no miracle.
Was just the touch in fingers.

912
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:17,815
Oh, I give you massage too.

913
01:02:17,883 --> 01:02:19,874
Very good after long drive.

914
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:22,442
- Well, I don't know. I really don't usually—
- Oh, <i>ja, ja.</i>

915
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:26,457
- I fix you just like husband.
- What?

916
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:28,891
Uh, Miss Svensson, uh—

917
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,895
- I don't think that you—
- Oh, <i>ja, ja,</i> it be fine.

918
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:34,761
Give you chance
to talk with your son.

919
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,267
- Oh, yes, see that he rests, Mother Arden.
- Come. Come.

920
01:02:37,335 --> 01:02:40,930
You must take off your clothes. Mmm.

921
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:44,169
What's going on around here?
Where'd she ever get such an idea?

922
01:02:44,242 --> 01:02:46,176
A nurse. And Swedish.

923
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:48,576
Necessity is the mother of invention...

924
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:50,615
and I was the mother who invented it.

925
01:02:50,682 --> 01:02:52,650
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just a little.

926
01:02:52,717 --> 01:02:57,484
I can't quite seem to adjust to two
daughters-in-law for only one son.

927
01:02:57,556 --> 01:03:00,821
Well, as long as you had only one,
why did it have to be me?

928
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:04,089
<i>Ja.</i> Lie down here on the bed, miss.

929
01:03:04,162 --> 01:03:06,096
It's missus.

930
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:11,432
Your husband's mother tell me
you been Mr. Arden's second wife.

931
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:13,869
Mm-hmm. He was a widower.

932
01:03:13,939 --> 01:03:15,463
<i>- Ja.</i>
- That's nice.

933
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,203
His poor wife lost
in the airplane accident.

934
01:03:19,277 --> 01:03:22,906
- My mother-in-law likes to chat.
<i>- Ja.</i>

935
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:25,415
I was thinking before—

936
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:29,853
What if Mr. Arden's
first wife didn't was dead?

937
01:03:29,921 --> 01:03:32,389
What an idea!

938
01:03:32,457 --> 01:03:36,018
When I was a little girl in Sweden,
I went once to the movies.

939
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:39,120
Poor Cary Grant thought
his first wife was dead...

940
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:42,132
so he married another lady.

941
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,863
But Irene Dunne,
who was the first wife...

942
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:48,667
she come back.

943
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,402
Movies. When do movies
ever reflect real life?

944
01:03:51,476 --> 01:03:54,934
<i>Ja.</i> But suppose
Mr. Arden's first wife...

945
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:58,540
was to come back
like Irene Dunne done— did.

946
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,551
- What would happen?
- Nothing would happen.

947
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:03,884
She'd still be legally dead
in the eyes of the law, and as long as she—

948
01:04:03,955 --> 01:04:06,287
Ow! Not— Not so hard!

949
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:10,055
But if she was dead by law
and alive by everything else, then what?

950
01:04:10,128 --> 01:04:12,289
I couldn't care less.
Mr. Arden's mine now.

951
01:04:12,364 --> 01:04:14,696
She'd just have to go back
to where she came from.

952
01:04:14,766 --> 01:04:16,063
- Ooh!
- Ow!

953
01:04:16,134 --> 01:04:18,864
- She would? She would?
- Ow! Ow!

954
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:20,928
It's just what you need!

955
01:04:21,006 --> 01:04:22,940
- It's good for you!
- Stop it!

956
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:26,603
All right, Mom. I'll tell her.

957
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:28,839
About time.

958
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:34,181
- First, I'd better have a cup of coffee.
- Oh, Nick.

959
01:04:34,252 --> 01:04:36,846
<i>Ow! Don't do that. Ouch!</i>

960
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:40,119
<i>Stop that! Nicholas. Help me!</i>

961
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,853
<i>Is good special Swedish massage!</i>

962
01:04:42,928 --> 01:04:46,329
I walk up and down your back!

963
01:04:46,398 --> 01:04:48,696
<i>On my back?</i>

964
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,928
With your shoes on?

965
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:53,994
- Is— Is wonderful for the spine!
- Ow!

966
01:04:54,072 --> 01:04:56,905
- Nicholas!
<i>- Good for you.</i>

967
01:04:56,975 --> 01:04:58,943
<i>- Nicholas!</i>
- What's going on? Get off of there.

968
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:00,409
Mom, help her.

969
01:05:00,478 --> 01:05:02,412
- Let go of me!
- There must be some mistake.

970
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,505
- Just behave.
- I want her thrown out of here!

971
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,244
Quiet. Quiet.

972
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:08,013
Quiet!

973
01:05:08,086 --> 01:05:10,577
- Don't tell me to be quiet!
- You shut up and sit down!

974
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,283
- I want that woman thrown out. She's a fake.
- You shut up too!

975
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:15,383
- Did you call me a fake?
- Get back over there!

976
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,291
I don't want that woman here!

977
01:05:17,362 --> 01:05:20,991
For your information, Bianca,
this woman is not "that woman."

978
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:23,694
It's time we had an understanding.
Damn it, I can't fire her.

979
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:25,702
- Why can't you?
- Because—

980
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:28,568
Because—

981
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,631
Because there's someone at the door!

982
01:05:40,518 --> 01:05:42,986
- Morning. Your name Arden?
- Oh, yes, it is, but—

983
01:05:43,054 --> 01:05:45,852
Prokey's my name. Clyde Prokey.
I'm with American Accident and Life.

984
01:05:45,924 --> 01:05:49,257
Hey, hey. This is quite a nice little place
you got here, Arden.

985
01:05:49,327 --> 01:05:51,386
I don't have time to talk
about insurance this morning.

986
01:05:51,463 --> 01:05:54,591
I'm not selling insurance, Mr. Arden.
I'm with the Claims Division.

987
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:57,226
My card. Clyde Prokey, adjuster.

988
01:05:57,302 --> 01:05:59,236
Got a little matter here
requires a signature.

989
01:05:59,304 --> 01:06:02,102
- All my policies are with the Eastern Life—
- Not your signature, Mr. Arden.

990
01:06:02,173 --> 01:06:04,232
This is for Mrs. Arden. She here?

991
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:06,607
Well, which Mrs. Arden?

992
01:06:06,678 --> 01:06:11,081
- How many you got?
- Well, uh, my mother. And there's my—

993
01:06:11,149 --> 01:06:14,516
No. I mean your wife. The one
who was on that island for five years.

994
01:06:14,586 --> 01:06:17,248
- How do you know about that?
- Well, that's my job to know, Arden.

995
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:20,553
Everything. Every little thing.

996
01:06:21,993 --> 01:06:24,962
But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with Clyde Prokey.

997
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,522
I'm a married man myself.
Now where is the little lady?

998
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:32,229
Uh, well, Mr. Prokey, I don't think
we should disturb her just now.

999
01:06:32,303 --> 01:06:35,363
- Things have been
a little complicated around here.
- Yeah. How about that!

1000
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,102
Uh, now,
what are these papers about?

1001
01:06:38,176 --> 01:06:40,508
I gotta say, Arden,
I take my hat off to you.

1002
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:42,842
I don't think I'd be
taking it as calm as you.

1003
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:45,405
Believe me, I haven't had a calm moment.
Let's see the papers.

1004
01:06:45,483 --> 01:06:47,951
What's to see? Just an affidavit
for the missus to sign.

1005
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:51,113
What kind of affidavit? She won't sign
anything unless I've seen it first.

1006
01:06:51,189 --> 01:06:53,589
You lawyers. Okay, here.

1007
01:06:53,658 --> 01:06:56,388
Affidavit that Stephen Burkett
is indeed alive...

1008
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:58,588
so his family will return
the insurance money.

1009
01:06:58,663 --> 01:07:00,597
Routine, Mr. Arden. Just routine.

1010
01:07:00,665 --> 01:07:03,634
Uh, who is this Stephen Burkett?

1011
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:06,227
The guy they rescued
off the island with your wife.

1012
01:07:10,475 --> 01:07:13,740
Aw, gee, fella. Sorry.
L— l— I thought you knew.

1013
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:17,338
Oh, of course I know.
Knew. Burkett.

1014
01:07:17,415 --> 01:07:19,349
Steve. Yes.

1015
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:21,408
<i>Yeah, he seems like a nice guy.</i>

1016
01:07:21,486 --> 01:07:24,080
Straight shooter. Called us about
his insurance the day he got back.

1017
01:07:24,155 --> 01:07:27,647
- He did, huh?
- Yeah.

1018
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:31,059
I, uh, buzzed over to see him yesterday
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

1019
01:07:31,129 --> 01:07:33,495
Looks none the worse for wear.

1020
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:38,332
Must've been a rugged experience,
the two of them alone there on that island.

1021
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:41,031
- I guess he told you all about it?
- Well, not all.

1022
01:07:41,106 --> 01:07:43,097
After all, he is a gentleman.

1023
01:07:44,609 --> 01:07:47,077
I mean, uh, h-he thinks
the worid of your missus.

1024
01:07:47,145 --> 01:07:49,409
Says she's a warm, wonderful woman.

1025
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:52,041
- And a darn good sport.
- That figures.

1026
01:07:52,117 --> 01:07:54,210
I mean,
it takes two intelligent people...

1027
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:58,278
to turn a Pacific island into,
uh, the Garden of Eden, right?

1028
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:00,290
Right.

1029
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:04,021
Uh, Mr. Prokey, I'll keep your affidavits.
I'll send them to you in the mail.

1030
01:08:04,095 --> 01:08:06,586
No, no, they've got to be signed
in my presence.

1031
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:09,792
- Adam said she'd be most cooperative.
- Adam? Who's Adam?

1032
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:12,610
- Burkett.
- It says Stephen Burkett.

1033
01:08:12,744 --> 01:08:15,542
Didn't she tell you about
that little gag they had going?

1034
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:18,013
She called him Adam.

1035
01:08:18,082 --> 01:08:20,676
And he called her—

1036
01:08:28,092 --> 01:08:30,060
Mr. Prokey, do you mind leaving?

1037
01:08:30,128 --> 01:08:33,154
- Yeah, but I've got to get the affidavit signed.
- Go ahead. Out! Just get out!

1038
01:08:33,231 --> 01:08:36,223
<i>What about the affidavit? I gotta get that signed.</i>

1039
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,901
- You ran away.
- Oh, yeah?

1040
01:08:44,976 --> 01:08:46,910
You're gonna stay right here
and listen.

1041
01:08:46,978 --> 01:08:49,708
- I am not!
- Well, that's a fine attitude for you to take.

1042
01:08:49,781 --> 01:08:51,840
- Oh! I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh?

1043
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:53,907
I wanna hear about you and Adam!

1044
01:09:02,493 --> 01:09:04,620
L— I meant to tell you about that.

1045
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:07,459
Oh, you meant to tell me about it?

1046
01:09:07,532 --> 01:09:10,695
It was such a casual thing
that it just slipped your mind?

1047
01:09:10,768 --> 01:09:15,034
Well, I never had a chance.
Besides, it was... perfectly harmless.

1048
01:09:15,106 --> 01:09:17,574
Harmless?
You call "Adam and Eve" harmless?

1049
01:09:17,642 --> 01:09:20,805
He broke his leg in the crash,
and he was laid up for six months.

1050
01:09:20,878 --> 01:09:24,177
Oh. What happened to
the other four and a half years?

1051
01:09:27,452 --> 01:09:29,386
Don't you trust your own wife?

1052
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:33,413
Oh, no. Don't try to change the subject.
I want to know the truth about Adam.

1053
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:37,719
That's a joke!

1054
01:09:37,795 --> 01:09:40,889
Oh, sweet, gentle little Adam.

1055
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,560
All he was interested in
is trees and flowers and fish.

1056
01:09:47,638 --> 01:09:49,572
You know the type.

1057
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,507
Oh, yes, I know the type.
Only I don't believe it.

1058
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:00,941
Nick, where are you going?

1059
01:10:01,018 --> 01:10:05,512
- I am going out!
- Nicky, you've got to stay here
and face this situation.

1060
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:08,286
Oh, I'll face it,
when I get all the facts.

1061
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:21,728
For heaven's sakes, Ellen, what did you
do to build such a fire under Nick?

1062
01:10:21,806 --> 01:10:23,865
Oh, Grace—

1063
01:10:29,147 --> 01:10:31,638
There was a man on that island with me.

1064
01:10:31,716 --> 01:10:35,152
How marvelous!
No wonder you look so well.

1065
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:39,622
But you silly girl,
why did you tell Nick?

1066
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:42,022
I didn't tell him.

1067
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:44,027
He just found out.

1068
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:46,586
Oh. Well, tell me then.

1069
01:10:46,664 --> 01:10:49,724
- I want to know everything.
- There's nothing to tell.

1070
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,496
- Nothing?
- Oh, it's not important, Grace.

1071
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:55,869
Well, it's important enough
to make Nick insanely jealous.

1072
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,965
I know.
And he hasn't even seen him.

1073
01:10:58,042 --> 01:11:00,806
- Well, maybe he should.
- Oh, no!

1074
01:11:02,013 --> 01:11:04,573
I mean, uh—
Uh, l— I don't think so.

1075
01:11:04,649 --> 01:11:06,879
- Uh—
<i>- I see.</i>

1076
01:11:06,951 --> 01:11:11,513
Mm-hmm. Yes, I do see.

1077
01:11:11,589 --> 01:11:16,083
Grace, will you please stop imagining things?
You're worse than your son.

1078
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,424
Maybe, uh...

1079
01:11:18,496 --> 01:11:22,489
you'd better go
and do some... shopping.

1080
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:26,230
Shopping? Who can think
about clothes at a time like this?

1081
01:11:26,304 --> 01:11:28,397
I wasn't thinking of clothes, dear.

1082
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,574
I had something else in mind.

1083
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:38,805
A man?

1084
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:42,944
Oh, Grace! Oh!

1085
01:11:44,422 --> 01:11:46,583
I can't do that.

1086
01:11:46,657 --> 01:11:49,922
You want to be a Swedish nurse
for the rest of your life?

1087
01:12:10,114 --> 01:12:13,242
- May I help you?
- Oh, uh, no, thank you.

1088
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:24,056
Excuse me. Do you know
a Mr. Stephen Burkett?

1089
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:27,586
Why, yes, sir.
That's him, on the trampoline.

1090
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:29,633
Thank you.

1091
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,969
- Young man.
- Oh, yes. May I help you?

1092
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:41,971
- Oh, yes, I think so.
- Oh.

1093
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:44,371
- What type are you looking for?
- You're just perfect.

1094
01:13:44,442 --> 01:13:46,603
- I beg your pardon?
- Uh, the shoe.

1095
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:50,477
It's just perfect. Do— Do you have it
in a seven and a half"A"?

1096
01:13:50,548 --> 01:13:53,847
- Oh, yes, yes. This shoe comes in all sizes.
- Good.

1097
01:13:53,918 --> 01:13:55,852
- If you'll just have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

1098
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,411
- Why, I'll go and get it for you.
- Thank you.

1099
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,768
This model is exclusive with us.

1100
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:22,074
It's your Bengal crocodile.

1101
01:14:22,146 --> 01:14:24,740
This is your true,
or saltwater, crocodile...

1102
01:14:24,815 --> 01:14:27,340
which is also found in South China...

1103
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:31,081
Northern Australia and the Fiji Islands.

1104
01:14:32,923 --> 01:14:35,221
Uh, and then there's
your tropical crocodile...

1105
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:38,352
which is found in Rhodesia
and parts of North America.

1106
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:41,762
But they really make
quite inferior footwear.

1107
01:14:41,832 --> 01:14:45,097
Are you free for lunch?

1108
01:14:45,169 --> 01:14:48,263
That is, inferior footwear
is made from them.

1109
01:14:48,339 --> 01:14:51,502
The crocodiles themselves
have no talent for making footwear.

1110
01:14:53,577 --> 01:14:56,045
- I said, would you have lunch with me?
- I bring my lunch.

1111
01:14:56,113 --> 01:14:58,172
- I'd be very grateful.
- Braunschweiger sandwiches.

1112
01:14:58,249 --> 01:15:00,217
- You could be my guest.
- I'm married.

1113
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:02,377
So am I.

1114
01:15:09,059 --> 01:15:11,527
- Oh, I don't think you understand.
- I understand, baby.

1115
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:14,223
- You want the shoes too?
- Oh, no, no. Just lunch.

1116
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:17,529
- Sure.
- I'll explain everything later.

1117
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,774
- Oh. Oh, Mr. Arden—
- Not now.

1118
01:17:38,842 --> 01:17:40,867
But there's somebody waiting for you.

1119
01:17:44,882 --> 01:17:46,850
Nicky, darling.

1120
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:49,044
I've brought someone for you to meet.

1121
01:17:50,654 --> 01:17:52,884
This is Adam.

1122
01:17:54,825 --> 01:17:58,591
Well, well. So this is Mr. Burkett.

1123
01:17:58,662 --> 01:18:01,130
Pleased to meet ya, Nick.

1124
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:04,361
Yeah, and I to meet you, Adam.

1125
01:18:04,435 --> 01:18:07,029
- Well, that— that's a little joke, you know.
- Yes, isn't it?

1126
01:18:09,106 --> 01:18:11,768
Well, why don't we all sit down, huh?

1127
01:18:14,678 --> 01:18:16,612
Well, I, uh—

1128
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,807
L— I really haven't much time.

1129
01:18:18,882 --> 01:18:22,181
I, uh— I'm making a report
to the Geographic Society...

1130
01:18:22,252 --> 01:18:25,449
on the flora and fauna
we found on the island.

1131
01:18:25,522 --> 01:18:29,424
I was really very excited
about the island vegetation.

1132
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:32,956
I'm afraid I spent
so much time on research...

1133
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:35,521
I was not very good company
for your wife.

1134
01:18:35,599 --> 01:18:39,968
- Well, I'm sure she understood.
- Of course.

1135
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:43,871
Uh, Eve said you had some
questions to ask me, Nick.

1136
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:47,240
Well, uh, let me see, uh—

1137
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:51,013
What kind of an island was it?

1138
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,049
Kind?

1139
01:18:54,218 --> 01:18:57,881
Uh, uh, well, I'd say it was a—

1140
01:18:57,955 --> 01:18:59,889
an ordinary island.

1141
01:18:59,957 --> 01:19:02,425
- Wouldn't you say?
- Oh, y— Oh, yes.

1142
01:19:02,493 --> 01:19:05,087
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Small?

1143
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:08,154
<i>Well, not small. Not large.</i>

1144
01:19:08,232 --> 01:19:11,395
- Medium.
- Medium. Medium.

1145
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:15,171
Uh, jungle?

1146
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:18,970
<i>- Jungle?</i>
- Well, y-you know, trees, vines.

1147
01:19:19,043 --> 01:19:21,273
Oh, trees!

1148
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:23,370
Oh, golly, yeah, trees.

1149
01:19:24,915 --> 01:19:27,645
- Uh, no vines?
- Oh, uh—

1150
01:19:27,718 --> 01:19:31,950
V- Vines, yeah. Around the trees.

1151
01:19:33,991 --> 01:19:35,925
Uh, water?

1152
01:19:35,993 --> 01:19:39,156
Oh, yeah, water.
Uh, around the island.

1153
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:42,399
Where'd you live?

1154
01:19:42,466 --> 01:19:44,934
The trees.
We lived— lived in trees.

1155
01:19:45,002 --> 01:19:47,232
- Oh.
- Separate trees.

1156
01:19:47,304 --> 01:19:50,603
Oh. Even during the rainy season?

1157
01:19:52,643 --> 01:19:56,909
- Oh, when it rained, we moved into caves.
- Oh.

1158
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,175
Separate caves.

1159
01:19:59,249 --> 01:20:03,185
Well, uh, I guess Adam
had better be running along.

1160
01:20:03,253 --> 01:20:05,881
- Oh, must you?
- Well, I don't know. L—

1161
01:20:05,956 --> 01:20:09,824
Well, you know the Geographic Society
insists on punctuality, Adam.

1162
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:12,384
And if Adam is anything, he's punctual.

1163
01:20:12,463 --> 01:20:15,762
A sterling quality.
Well, it's been nice meeting you, Adam.

1164
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:19,234
- Hey, uh, we should get together sometime, huh?
- Yeah. That's a good idea.

1165
01:20:19,303 --> 01:20:21,294
Maybe we should make a night of it.

1166
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:24,306
- Have some chow mein, go bowling or something.
- Yeah, sure.

1167
01:20:24,374 --> 01:20:27,002
- Thursday?
- Well, uh, Thursday—

1168
01:20:27,077 --> 01:20:29,068
- Oh, it's good to see you again, Adam.
- Bye.

1169
01:20:29,146 --> 01:20:31,444
<i>- Good-bye, Adam.</i>
- Good-bye.

1170
01:20:31,515 --> 01:20:33,483
- Real nice chap.
- Thank you.

1171
01:20:35,385 --> 01:20:37,319
There now.

1172
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:41,190
- Satisfied?
- Completely.

1173
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:43,818
Are you ashamed
of all those nasty suspicions?

1174
01:20:43,894 --> 01:20:46,829
- I blush at the thought.
- Oh, Nicky.

1175
01:20:46,897 --> 01:20:51,300
Imagine thinking
that sweet little man and I were—

1176
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:55,134
Really!

1177
01:21:01,378 --> 01:21:03,312
Oh, sweetheart. Look—

1178
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:07,544
Now that you're here,
why don't we go for a drive...

1179
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:09,609
and maybe stop for
something to drink, huh?

1180
01:21:09,686 --> 01:21:12,246
Oh, I'd love it.
Um, will you let me drive?

1181
01:21:12,322 --> 01:21:14,256
- Oh, sure.
- I need the practice.

1182
01:21:14,324 --> 01:21:17,521
Mm-hmm. Shall we go together
or in separate cars, hmm?

1183
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:28,685
Whew. I didn't do too badly, did I?

1184
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:30,957
Oh, no. Except when
you made that left-hand turn...

1185
01:21:31,031 --> 01:21:33,226
you signaled
with your windshield wipers.

1186
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,996
It's all those buttons, Nicky.
They confuse me.

1187
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:38,003
It's like learning all over again.

1188
01:21:38,071 --> 01:21:41,598
Well, that's civilization for you, Eve.

1189
01:21:50,383 --> 01:21:52,442
- Two, please.
- Right this way, please.

1190
01:21:58,091 --> 01:22:00,525
Oh, uh, why don't you sit there?
I'll sit here.

1191
01:22:00,594 --> 01:22:02,994
- Oh. Why?
- Uh, keep the sun out of your eyes.

1192
01:22:03,063 --> 01:22:05,088
I don't mind the sun.

1193
01:22:07,067 --> 01:22:10,230
Uh, what would you like, dear?

1194
01:22:10,303 --> 01:22:12,703
- Scotch? Martini?
- You know what I'd love?

1195
01:22:12,773 --> 01:22:15,207
Something I've been dreaming
about for five years—

1196
01:22:15,275 --> 01:22:17,766
a big, fat double-dipped
chocolate soda.

1197
01:22:19,646 --> 01:22:22,513
- And you, sir?
- Scotch, please.

1198
01:22:22,582 --> 01:22:24,880
- A big, fat double?
- On the rocks.

1199
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:31,781
- You sure you wouldn't rather sit over here?
- I'm fine.

1200
01:22:31,858 --> 01:22:34,292
- Really, I love the sun.
- You're squinting.

1201
01:22:34,361 --> 01:22:36,921
I'm smiling.

1202
01:22:39,065 --> 01:22:41,056
On the back. Get it on the back.

1203
01:22:41,134 --> 01:22:43,864
A very attractive group of people here,
don't you think?

1204
01:22:43,937 --> 01:22:47,065
Oh, Nicky. You're funny.

1205
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:49,199
Me?

1206
01:22:49,276 --> 01:22:51,870
You're trying so hard
to make conversation with me.

1207
01:22:51,945 --> 01:22:56,473
- Oh, well—
- Of course, we have been apart a long time.

1208
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:59,485
Oh, Nicky.
I know it hasn't been easy for you.

1209
01:22:59,553 --> 01:23:03,546
- I mean, with Jenny and Didi.
- Oh, well, they're great kids.

1210
01:23:03,623 --> 01:23:07,024
Oh, they are. They're marvelous.

1211
01:23:07,093 --> 01:23:10,460
And you've just done the most
wonderful job of raising them.

1212
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:14,364
Oh, kids aren't hard to bring up.

1213
01:23:14,434 --> 01:23:17,164
You just pretend they're someone else's.

1214
01:23:17,237 --> 01:23:20,229
But they're not someone else's.
They're ours.

1215
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:25,867
Oh, and I can't seem to find
a way to tell them who I am.

1216
01:23:27,914 --> 01:23:30,246
Well, we'll work it out.

1217
01:23:36,256 --> 01:23:38,190
Nick, there's—

1218
01:23:39,459 --> 01:23:42,428
there's something that I'd—
I'd like to tell you.

1219
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:44,656
Well?

1220
01:23:44,731 --> 01:23:49,532
Oh, I'm such a dope. And I meant well,
Nick, but I'm such a dope.

1221
01:23:49,603 --> 01:23:52,697
About what?

1222
01:23:52,772 --> 01:23:56,003
That man that I brought to your office
was not Stephen Burkett.

1223
01:23:56,076 --> 01:23:59,978
- Really?
- No. He was a shoe clerk.

1224
01:24:00,046 --> 01:24:02,378
And I paid him to say those things.

1225
01:24:05,252 --> 01:24:08,688
Oh, Nick, I thought if you met
the real Stephen Burkett...

1226
01:24:08,755 --> 01:24:10,916
that you just— that you just might—

1227
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:13,755
I might what?

1228
01:24:13,827 --> 01:24:17,058
Well, I thought that you might think
what I thought you were thinking...

1229
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:19,121
you know,
when you thought that— that—

1230
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,534
Well, he is kind of attractive.

1231
01:24:22,602 --> 01:24:25,469
Burkett?

1232
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:28,473
Oh, not to me. Not to me at all.

1233
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,771
But— But some people
might think so.

1234
01:24:30,844 --> 01:24:33,404
And l— I was just so afraid—
so afraid that you might—

1235
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,448
that you might be upset.

1236
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:47,785
E- Ellen, let's get out of here.

1237
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:49,556
- Oh, Nick, you are upset.
- I'm not.

1238
01:24:49,629 --> 01:24:51,221
- Please don't be.
- I'm not.

1239
01:24:51,298 --> 01:24:53,562
- You hate me. I know you do.
- I don't.

1240
01:24:53,633 --> 01:24:55,999
It's just I know where
they serve a better soda.

1241
01:24:56,069 --> 01:24:59,129
- Where?
- Oh, Ellen, come on.

1242
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:03,605
<i>Sir! Sir!</i>

1243
01:25:03,677 --> 01:25:07,169
- Your doubles.
- You go ahead, Ellen. I'll catch up.

1244
01:25:08,181 --> 01:25:10,615
Here.

1245
01:25:10,684 --> 01:25:12,811
<i>Eve!</i>

1246
01:25:15,255 --> 01:25:17,155
<i>Eve.</i>

1247
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:21,260
Baby! What are you doing here?

1248
01:25:21,328 --> 01:25:23,592
Me? What are you doing here?

1249
01:25:23,663 --> 01:25:26,154
Oh, just trying to unwind a little.

1250
01:25:28,802 --> 01:25:30,736
So that's why you brought me here!

1251
01:25:30,804 --> 01:25:32,738
Oh, Ellen,
it only appears that way—

1252
01:25:32,806 --> 01:25:35,639
- What a miserable, dirty rotten trick!
- Oh, honey, this can't be Nicky.

1253
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:38,371
- Why can't it be?
- You just wanted to humiliate me, that's all.

1254
01:25:38,445 --> 01:25:41,073
- I'm Steve Burkett, old buddy.
- He knows perfectly well who you are.

1255
01:25:41,147 --> 01:25:43,672
- And he's a suspicious, narrow-minded, jealous—
- Let's go, honey.

1256
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,082
- I'll explain in the car. You see—
- Explain what?

1257
01:25:46,152 --> 01:25:49,713
- How you deliberately made
a fool of me all afternoon?
- Ellen!

1258
01:25:53,727 --> 01:25:56,992
Man, she sure looks great in clothes.

1259
01:25:57,063 --> 01:25:59,554
I've got a few questions
for you, old buddy.

1260
01:25:59,632 --> 01:26:03,363
Uh-uh. I just sold exclusive rights
to my story to <i>Life</i> magazine...

1261
01:26:03,436 --> 01:26:05,404
old buddy.

1262
01:26:11,644 --> 01:26:14,272
Ellen. Ellen, wait! Ellen!

1263
01:26:16,783 --> 01:26:19,308
Hey, cab. Follow that car!

1264
01:26:54,988 --> 01:26:58,253
Oh, women! I'll never figure
them out if I live to be—

1265
01:26:58,324 --> 01:27:00,258
if I live!

1266
01:27:00,326 --> 01:27:03,261
- Talk up, mister. Don't mumble.
- Just keep your eye on the road.

1267
01:27:03,329 --> 01:27:05,354
- And catch that car, that's all.
- Catch that car.

1268
01:27:24,851 --> 01:27:27,115
Catch that nut before she kills herself.

1269
01:27:27,187 --> 01:27:29,849
- We could all go, mister.
- I'll double anything on the meter.

1270
01:27:29,923 --> 01:27:31,857
I can't spend it up there.

1271
01:28:27,046 --> 01:28:29,879
Oh. Oh, no. Shut the door.

1272
01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:53,105
Get me out of here!

1273
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:56,472
Oh!

1274
01:29:15,161 --> 01:29:17,823
Oh, my hair!

1275
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,334
Oh, help!

1276
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:38,179
Oh, help!

1277
01:29:53,433 --> 01:29:55,025
Ellen!

1278
01:30:12,952 --> 01:30:15,819
I can't help myself, Dr. Schlick.

1279
01:30:15,888 --> 01:30:18,584
That's how I feel about my marriage.

1280
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:22,594
Very well. I will have
a little chat with your Nicholas.

1281
01:30:22,662 --> 01:30:27,929
- If he arrives ever.
- Oh, you are such a comfort, Doctor.

1282
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:30,333
You know, I truly believe...

1283
01:30:30,403 --> 01:30:33,201
the most vital relationship
a woman can establish...

1284
01:30:33,273 --> 01:30:36,902
is not between man and wife.

1285
01:30:36,976 --> 01:30:41,174
It's the relationship between
a woman and her analyst.

1286
01:30:41,247 --> 01:30:44,341
Don't you agree, Dr. Schlick?

1287
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:46,851
Call me Herman.

1288
01:31:02,502 --> 01:31:04,470
Will you wait a minute, please?

1289
01:31:14,213 --> 01:31:16,204
Ellen. Wait!

1290
01:31:19,185 --> 01:31:21,119
Ellen, wait.

1291
01:31:21,187 --> 01:31:24,520
- We can settle this thing right here and now.
- Ooh!

1292
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:28,219
Ow! Oh, Ellen, stop—
Ellen, come here. Listen to me.

1293
01:31:28,294 --> 01:31:31,092
- I said let go of me!
- Nicholas!

1294
01:31:31,164 --> 01:31:34,361
- See what I mean, Herman?
- You didn't say he was violent.

1295
01:31:34,434 --> 01:31:36,994
- Nicholas.
- What on earth is all this yelling about?

1296
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:39,004
Nicholas, let that woman go!

1297
01:31:39,072 --> 01:31:41,506
- Not until she answers my question!
- I won't answer anything.

1298
01:31:41,574 --> 01:31:45,010
- You big bully!
- I want to know what happened on that island.

1299
01:31:45,078 --> 01:31:48,570
You don't have to know anything. You should learn
to trust your wife, with no questions asked!

1300
01:31:48,648 --> 01:31:52,243
- He doesn't trust you?
- Not her. Her. She's my wife!

1301
01:31:52,318 --> 01:31:54,286
- Oh.
- There! I said it. Are you satisfied?

1302
01:31:54,354 --> 01:31:57,016
- You're my wife!
- I was your wife!

1303
01:31:57,090 --> 01:32:01,117
- Oh, you poor dear boy.
- Oh, Mom, will you tell her Ellen's my wife?

1304
01:32:01,194 --> 01:32:04,493
- Who is this Ellen?
- She's my wife, stupid!

1305
01:32:04,564 --> 01:32:06,498
His first wife. She's dead!

1306
01:32:06,566 --> 01:32:09,592
- And that woman—
- That's the nurse I told you about.

1307
01:32:09,669 --> 01:32:12,137
A nurse from the Busy Bee Car Wash?

1308
01:32:12,205 --> 01:32:14,673
She is not a nurse!
These are her clothes.

1309
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:19,075
She is Ellen Wagstaff Arden, my wife, stupid!

1310
01:32:20,346 --> 01:32:22,314
- Yes?
- You Nicholas Arden?

1311
01:32:22,382 --> 01:32:25,078
- Yes. What do you want?
- We have a warrant for your arrest.

1312
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:27,517
Arrest? What for?

1313
01:32:27,587 --> 01:32:29,851
- Bigamy.
- Bigamy?

1314
01:32:29,922 --> 01:32:31,856
There, now do you believe me?

1315
01:32:31,924 --> 01:32:34,654
But he's not a bigamist.
Who made such a ridiculous charge?

1316
01:32:34,727 --> 01:32:37,423
- Yeah.
- A Mrs. Grace Arden.

1317
01:32:37,497 --> 01:32:40,193
- My... mother?
- That's right.

1318
01:32:40,266 --> 01:32:44,896
If you can't settle this mess,
maybe the courts can.

1319
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:49,367
Quiet. Quiet!
Can't we have a little order in here?

1320
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:51,637
Order. Order in the court.

1321
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:54,908
I don't know why this has to be
the loudest court in the state.

1322
01:32:54,981 --> 01:32:57,449
Well, where's the district attorney?
Isn't this his case?

1323
01:32:57,517 --> 01:32:59,508
Yes, Your Honor.

1324
01:32:59,585 --> 01:33:02,782
I know he's the district attorney.
I know that.

1325
01:33:02,855 --> 01:33:05,585
Now, uh, what is all this?

1326
01:33:05,658 --> 01:33:09,458
Your Honor, in an effort to expedite matters
in this somewhat unusual hearing...

1327
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:13,090
we pray decisions on a number
of legal actions filed concurrently...

1328
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:15,999
all of which are components
of one basic familial disturbance.

1329
01:33:16,068 --> 01:33:19,868
Sounds like something the court of appeals
is going to reverse me on already.

1330
01:33:19,939 --> 01:33:23,204
If the bailiff will call the principals...

1331
01:33:23,276 --> 01:33:25,870
I will try to provide the court
with the various issues involved.

1332
01:33:25,945 --> 01:33:27,810
Nicholas Arden.

1333
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,281
<i> Mr. Nicholas Arden,</i>
<i>a respected member of the local bar...</i>

1334
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:33,409
<i>is charged primarily with bigamy...</i>

1335
01:33:33,486 --> 01:33:36,944
but is also a party
to one or two other actions.

1336
01:33:37,023 --> 01:33:39,719
- Haven't I seen you here before?
- Well, yes, sir.

1337
01:33:39,792 --> 01:33:41,726
- Mrs. Grace Arden.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1338
01:33:41,794 --> 01:33:45,059
It is Mrs. Grace Arden who brought
the charge of bigamy against Mr. Arden.

1339
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:47,326
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself, ma'am—

1340
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,493
a woman your age marrying this man.

1341
01:33:49,569 --> 01:33:53,061
Marrying him?
I happen to be his mother.

1342
01:33:53,139 --> 01:33:56,336
You mean, your own mother
charged you with bigamy?

1343
01:33:56,409 --> 01:33:59,572
I certainly did!

1344
01:33:59,645 --> 01:34:02,045
I hope you remember this
on Mother's Day.

1345
01:34:02,114 --> 01:34:04,412
<i>Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden.</i>

1346
01:34:04,484 --> 01:34:08,352
Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden
is one of the wives of the defendant...

1347
01:34:08,421 --> 01:34:10,753
and is asking for an annulment
of that marriage.

1348
01:34:10,823 --> 01:34:13,621
- You look familiar, young lady.
- I hope so, Your Honor.

1349
01:34:13,693 --> 01:34:16,890
- You married me.
- No, I married a little, short, fat—

1350
01:34:16,963 --> 01:34:19,158
Oh, you—you mean to him.

1351
01:34:19,232 --> 01:34:21,200
Oh, yes. I remember you now.

1352
01:34:21,267 --> 01:34:23,701
You're that do-it-yourself
head-shrinker.

1353
01:34:23,769 --> 01:34:27,261
<i>Please, Your Honor! Please!</i>
<i>May I object to that remark?</i>

1354
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:31,208
- Who are you?
- I happen to be Dr. Herman Schlick.

1355
01:34:31,277 --> 01:34:34,906
He's my analyst and my dearest friend.

1356
01:34:34,981 --> 01:34:37,916
And he's here to testify to my
emotional need for an annulment.

1357
01:34:37,984 --> 01:34:41,385
Yes, this man is completely unstable,
with definite schizoid tendencies—

1358
01:34:41,454 --> 01:34:44,946
Quiet. Nobody asked you
to testify, Doctor.

1359
01:34:45,024 --> 01:34:47,322
Just take your seat.

1360
01:34:47,393 --> 01:34:51,159
- Can he do that?
- It's all right, dear. Really!

1361
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:54,825
- Did you say she wanted an annulment?
- I most certainly do.

1362
01:34:54,901 --> 01:34:59,935
Now even my marriages
are being reversed on me.

1363
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,037
- What was wrong with it?
- Well, as usual in such cases—

1364
01:35:02,104 --> 01:35:04,504
- Un-kissed, you mean?
- Un-anything.

1365
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:07,406
Harvard man.

1366
01:35:08,777 --> 01:35:11,610
<i>Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden.</i>

1367
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,945
<i> Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden,</i>
<i>who on the motion of Mr. Arden...</i>

1368
01:35:15,017 --> 01:35:18,612
<i>was declared legally dead, now petitions</i>
<i>the court to reverse that order.</i>

1369
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:23,090
Now, what bumbling idiot ever declared this
perfectly healthy-looking young woman dead?

1370
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:25,126
- Well, you did, Your Honor.
- Oh.

1371
01:35:25,194 --> 01:35:27,162
Uh, strike my last remark
from the record.

1372
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:29,959
When Mrs. Arden is declared
legally alive again...

1373
01:35:30,032 --> 01:35:32,899
she asks a divorce from Mr. Arden.

1374
01:35:32,968 --> 01:35:35,630
Well, if that's on my account,
you can save yourself the trouble.

1375
01:35:35,704 --> 01:35:38,730
It's no trouble. He's all yours.

1376
01:35:38,807 --> 01:35:42,573
I couldn't possibly
be less interested in the man.

1377
01:35:42,645 --> 01:35:45,113
Well, you seem to be back
in public domain, counselor.

1378
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,775
In the event Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden's
petition for annulment is denied...

1379
01:35:48,851 --> 01:35:51,046
she also asks a divorce from Mr. Arden.

1380
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,111
- On what grounds?
- Mental cruelty.

1381
01:35:53,188 --> 01:35:56,351
- Extreme mental cruelty.
- Oh, nonsense—

1382
01:35:56,425 --> 01:35:58,416
- Quiet.
- At the same time, Your Honor...

1383
01:35:58,494 --> 01:36:00,928
Mr. Arden is bringing countersuits
for divorce against...

1384
01:36:00,996 --> 01:36:03,794
Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden
and Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden.

1385
01:36:03,866 --> 01:36:06,494
Against me?

1386
01:36:06,569 --> 01:36:09,060
How could you?

1387
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:11,629
- You're doing it to me.
- That's entirely different.

1388
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:15,199
Your Honor, against Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden...

1389
01:36:15,277 --> 01:36:19,771
Mr. Arden names as corespondent,
Mr. Stephen Burkett.

1390
01:36:19,848 --> 01:36:23,978
Oh, Nicholas Arden, don't you ever
speak to me again as long as you live!

1391
01:36:24,053 --> 01:36:26,817
<i>Come back here, young woman.</i>
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1392
01:36:26,889 --> 01:36:30,222
I will not stay here
and be humiliated by this— this—

1393
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:33,284
You are going to stay here.
And don't argue with me.

1394
01:36:33,362 --> 01:36:35,091
I'll fine you $25 for contempt.

1395
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,632
How can you fine a corpse?
I'm still legally dead.

1396
01:36:40,703 --> 01:36:42,671
Then I'll declare you legally alive.

1397
01:36:42,738 --> 01:36:45,832
If you do that before the annulment,
Your Honor, I'll be guilty of bigamy.

1398
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:51,104
I should've played golf today,
arthritis and all.

1399
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,444
I'm also asking
for a restraining order...

1400
01:36:53,515 --> 01:36:57,212
against the publication of Mr. Burkett's
story in a national magazine...

1401
01:36:57,286 --> 01:37:00,278
on the grounds that it may
hold me up to public ridicule.

1402
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:02,881
Oh, really? What is the story?

1403
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:05,483
- Well, I don't know it, Your Honor.
- You don't know it?

1404
01:37:05,561 --> 01:37:08,530
Well, no, sir. That's why I asked
for a subpoena for Mr. Burkett...

1405
01:37:08,597 --> 01:37:10,531
so he can tell his story in court.

1406
01:37:10,599 --> 01:37:12,692
- Stephen Burkett!
- That isn't necessary!

1407
01:37:14,269 --> 01:37:16,829
Would you like to change places
with me, madam?

1408
01:37:16,905 --> 01:37:19,339
Your Honor, do we have to discuss it here?
It isn't "revelant."

1409
01:37:19,408 --> 01:37:21,376
- Relevant.
- R-Relevant.

1410
01:37:21,443 --> 01:37:23,843
It so happens I consider it
entirely "revelant"...

1411
01:37:23,912 --> 01:37:26,540
<i>and I consider you</i>
<i>entirely out of order.</i>

1412
01:37:26,615 --> 01:37:30,142
- Now don't tax my patience.
- Good morning, Your Honor.

1413
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,653
What's your story, Tarzan?

1414
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:35,713
Well, sir, Ellen and I were both
survivors of that plane crash.

1415
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:38,351
- Now, I'm a very strong swimmer—
- Never mind about your strength.

1416
01:37:38,427 --> 01:37:41,191
- Just get to the point.
- I'll do the questioning here, counselor.

1417
01:37:41,263 --> 01:37:43,561
Go on. After the crash,
what happened?

1418
01:37:43,632 --> 01:37:46,226
- Well, sir, when—
- Nothing happened.

1419
01:37:46,301 --> 01:37:49,634
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Can he do that?

1420
01:37:49,705 --> 01:37:51,696
He can do whatever he wants.
He's the judge.

1421
01:37:51,774 --> 01:37:53,833
That's right. Well?

1422
01:37:53,909 --> 01:37:56,935
Well, sir, I fished Ellen out of the water,
got her to that island...

1423
01:37:57,012 --> 01:37:59,344
where we stayed
until we were, uh, rescued.

1424
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,384
- Oh? How long was that?
- Five years.

1425
01:38:03,852 --> 01:38:06,582
You two were on that island
together for five years?

1426
01:38:06,655 --> 01:38:08,987
And three days.

1427
01:38:09,058 --> 01:38:12,824
- Were they alone?
- Oh, just the two of us,
Your Honor—Adam and Eve.

1428
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:15,887
- Is that in the brief?
- It is not.

1429
01:38:16,965 --> 01:38:18,899
Oh, that should be in the brief.

1430
01:38:18,967 --> 01:38:21,401
- That's the most interesting part of the case.
<i>- Your Honor.</i>

1431
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:25,099
May I please have your permission
to get out of here before I explode?

1432
01:38:25,174 --> 01:38:27,506
I'd like to go home myself.

1433
01:38:27,576 --> 01:38:29,567
I'd like to tell my wife about this.

1434
01:38:29,645 --> 01:38:31,772
She thinks all my cases are dull.

1435
01:38:31,847 --> 01:38:33,781
This one's a doozy.

1436
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:40,547
Now then, counselor,
we'll take first things first.

1437
01:38:40,622 --> 01:38:43,090
Uh, what is the first thing?

1438
01:38:43,158 --> 01:38:45,456
The charge of bigamy, Your Honor.

1439
01:38:45,527 --> 01:38:47,552
I have a precedent to cite.
The case of—

1440
01:38:47,629 --> 01:38:51,190
Never mind. I'm not interested in precedents.
My decisions are obvious.

1441
01:38:51,266 --> 01:38:53,666
When you married
the second Mrs. Arden...

1442
01:38:53,736 --> 01:38:56,569
the first Mrs. Arden
had been declared legally dead.

1443
01:38:56,638 --> 01:39:00,130
So I hereby dismiss the charge of bigamy.

1444
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:04,475
Now, as for the second matter,
the "kissless" bride—

1445
01:39:04,546 --> 01:39:06,912
I hereby annul that marriage.

1446
01:39:06,982 --> 01:39:08,973
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now may I leave?

1447
01:39:09,051 --> 01:39:12,509
As far as I'm concerned, you may all leave.
And the sooner the better.

1448
01:39:12,588 --> 01:39:14,556
But, Judge, I'm still legally dead!

1449
01:39:14,623 --> 01:39:19,287
Oh, yes. I hereby declare
Ellen Wagstaff Arden legally alive.

1450
01:39:19,361 --> 01:39:21,295
Does that mean
she's married to him again?

1451
01:39:21,363 --> 01:39:23,297
You're darn right she's
married to me again— Still!

1452
01:39:23,365 --> 01:39:26,266
- I didn't ask you. I asked the judge.
- Leave me out of this.

1453
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:29,463
- Case dismissed.
- Now wait, Your Honor. You can't do that.

1454
01:39:29,538 --> 01:39:32,564
- He can do whatever he wants. He's the judge.
- That's right.

1455
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:35,269
- But you haven't heard the whole story.
- I don't have to hear it.

1456
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:37,972
I'll take your petition for divorce
under advisement and let you know later.

1457
01:39:38,046 --> 01:39:41,015
How much later? I'd like to know
when Ellen's free to marry me.

1458
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:44,075
- You hear that? Something
did happen on that island!

1459
01:39:44,153 --> 01:39:46,348
- Nothing happened!
- Ellen, tell them what—

1460
01:39:46,421 --> 01:39:48,821
- You keep quiet!
<i>- Here! Here!</i>

1461
01:39:48,891 --> 01:39:51,655
<i> And you stop banging</i>
<i>that silly little hammer!</i>

1462
01:39:51,727 --> 01:39:53,786
What are you beefing about,
anyway, old buddy?

1463
01:39:53,862 --> 01:39:57,389
You and Ellen were married for only three years,
while she and I were together for five.

1464
01:39:57,466 --> 01:40:00,162
- So I'm claiming her on the basis of seniority.
- Ooh!

1465
01:40:00,235 --> 01:40:02,260
Well, you can have her.

1466
01:40:02,337 --> 01:40:04,271
- Nicky!
- Baby.

1467
01:40:04,339 --> 01:40:06,273
See what you've done!

1468
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:09,538
Look, let's you and me cut out
to my hotel and talk it over, huh?

1469
01:40:09,611 --> 01:40:13,604
For five years you've been a big fat pain
in the neck, chasing me around that island...

1470
01:40:13,682 --> 01:40:17,015
and I told you I never wanna look
at that wolfish face of yours again!

1471
01:40:17,085 --> 01:40:19,986
You're a smug, egotistical,
strutting peacock!

1472
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:22,182
Well, then, uh, how about lunch?

1473
01:40:33,869 --> 01:40:38,203
For five years you went through
this kind of treatment?

1474
01:40:38,273 --> 01:40:40,400
My goodness.

1475
01:41:03,398 --> 01:41:05,491
- Where have you been?
- Where's Nicky?

1476
01:41:05,567 --> 01:41:07,558
I expected you back hours ago.

1477
01:41:07,636 --> 01:41:11,003
- Didn't he come home with you?
- After the way he stormed out of that courtroom?

1478
01:41:11,073 --> 01:41:13,064
I took a cab.

1479
01:41:14,676 --> 01:41:17,270
I've just made such a mess of everything.

1480
01:41:18,547 --> 01:41:20,481
And what about the children?

1481
01:41:20,549 --> 01:41:23,040
Well, they had to live without a mother
for a long time.

1482
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:25,450
I suppose they can do without
a father around the house.

1483
01:41:27,556 --> 01:41:30,719
Oh, Grace. How will I ever
explain to them?

1484
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:35,627
You just march yourself out there
and tell your children who you are.

1485
01:41:35,697 --> 01:41:38,063
Go on.

1486
01:42:11,366 --> 01:42:13,664
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1487
01:42:20,409 --> 01:42:22,775
Hi, Mommy.

1488
01:42:32,821 --> 01:42:37,315
<i>Well, isn't it about time somebody</i>
<i>started kissing somebody around here?</i>

1489
01:42:39,127 --> 01:42:41,118
Oh, Nicky!

1490
01:42:50,072 --> 01:42:52,563
- Hey!
- It's my turn.
