1
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,042
- Jacob was a good farmer.
- But not the man to buy your horse.

2
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:45,259
Hochleitner, wasn't it your father sold
him a horse with the ruptured testicle?

3
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:51,260
- "A bee sting made him limp that way."
- That horse had one good ball.

4
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:53,386
That's all it takes.

5
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,008
Rachel...

6
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:34,388
I'm sorry about Jacob.
I know he'll walk with God.

7
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:37,316
Thank you, Daniel.

8
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:47,743
- Daniel.
- Good morning.

9
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:52,661
So, first time to the big city?

10
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:56,298
You'll see so many things.

11
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,837
Close your eyes.

12
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:05,227
Open.

13
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,851
Samuel, careful!

14
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:16,611
You come back soon.

15
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,036
Samuel!

16
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,702
Samuel...

17
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,251
You be careful out among the English.

18
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:08,209
Mama, look!

19
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:03,177
Oh, he's a cute little Amish boy.

20
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:09,023
We have tickets to Baltimore.
Where is that train?

21
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:12,403
It's delayed three hours. You'll hear it
announced when it's time to board.

22
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:18,654
Just take a seat over there.
I have to wait on these people.

23
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,253
Mama, look. What's that thing?

24
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:49,655
Don't go far, Samuel.

25
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,575
Mama...
Where's the bathroom?

26
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:17,871
It's over there.

27
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,536
Hey, man.

28
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:22,255
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Washing my hands, man.

29
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:26,636
- Let's get out of here.
- Hold tight.

30
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,863
I already did that.

31
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:49,613
Let's check it again.

32
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:34,934
Move these people back.

33
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:38,237
Get Schaeffer down here, now.

34
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:43,026
Who found the body?
How you doing? You found the body?

35
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:45,995
- I just reported it. It was the kid.
- What kid?

36
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,666
How do I know what kid?
The kid in the funny black threads.

37
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,628
How's he doing?

38
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:04,180
I'm a police officer.
I have to talk to the boy.

39
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,681
What's your name?

40
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,808
Samuel.

41
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:14,021
- Samuel Lapp.
- And he's your son?

42
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:19,569
We were on our way to Baltimore.
Soon our train is leaving.

43
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:21,989
We'll get you on another train.

44
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:25,369
Sam, the man who was killed tonight -

45
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:29,828
- was a policeman.
It's my job to find out what happened.

46
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:35,332
I want you to tell me
everything you saw in the bathroom.

47
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:43,339
There were two.
I only saw one.

48
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:49,345
- Does anybody know about this?
- No, nobody's talked to him.

49
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:53,065
What did he look like,
the man that you saw?

50
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:58,153
- He was like him.
- A black man?

51
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:03,823
- He had black skin?
- Yes, but not stumpig.

52
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,198
What's stumpig?

53
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:12,538
On a farm, when a pig is born small
like that, he's stumpig. A runt.

54
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,715
So he wasn't a runt.

55
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,969
- He was a big guy, like me?
- Big guy.

56
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:44,995
- Where are you taking us?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

57
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:51,590
We're looking for a suspect. I want
the little boy to take a look at him.

58
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,124
You have no right to keep us here.

59
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:59,044
Yes, I do. Your son's a material witness
to a homicide.

60
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:02,599
You don't understand.
We want nothing to do with your laws.

61
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:09,145
Doesn't surprise me.
A lot of people I meet are like that.

62
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:21,360
- What did he say?
- He asked who you are. Your name.

63
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:25,116
I told him we didn't need to know
anything about you.

64
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:30,254
Book.
John Book.

65
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,870
Where are you going?

66
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:21,854
- Looking good, T-Bone.
- What the fuck..?

67
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:34,617
Is this the man, Sam? Is this him?
You're sure?

68
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:41,239
- Back off!
- We want no further part of this.

69
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:42,834
Okay. Get back in the car.

70
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:51,716
Hey, honest mistake, all right?

71
00:20:57,225 --> 00:21:00,725
What are we gonna do with them?
A hotel?

72
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:08,069
No, they won't be there in the morning.
We'll have to get them in Baltimore.

73
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:10,113
I got it.

74
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,534
This is my sister, Elaine.
This is Mrs Lapp and Samuel.

75
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:21,037
- Where do they go, the blue room?
- Sure, the blue room.

76
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:25,297
- Can I help you with something?
- No.

77
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:30,172
Right back there, Sam.

78
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:33,802
- How could you do this to me tonight?
- It's important.

79
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:38,974
Just keep going straight through.
There's a folding cot for your son.

80
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:47,320
- I told you I had company!
- Are Jason and Billy asleep?

81
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,608
- And you got a man in the house?
- That's none of your business.

82
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:57,406
Anyway, they like Fred.
Who are these orphans, anyway?

83
00:21:57,624 --> 00:21:59,663
They're Amish.

84
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:13,922
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.

85
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:16,680
- John says you're Amish.
- Yes.

86
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,641
Oh...

87
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:36,745
- Do we have to stay here?
- No, we don't. Just for the night.

88
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:40,458
Say your prayers.

89
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,420
- Hey, Captain.
- Hey, Bob.

90
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:58,512
- When can we leave the city?
- I'll try to get this over with quickly.

91
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:01,982
But Samuel will have to come back
and testify. I'm sorry.

92
00:23:02,193 --> 00:23:08,066
No, you're not. You're glad.
Because now you have a witness.

93
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:12,661
I just don't like my son spending time
with a man who carries a gun -

94
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:14,746
- and goes around whacking people.

95
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:16,286
"Whacking"?

96
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,337
Come here, kiddo.

97
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,879
Big guy...

98
00:23:27,096 --> 00:23:30,133
You can see them,
but they can't see you.

99
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:35,094
I want the hats and sunglasses off.
Straighten up.

100
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:40,692
Tell me if any of these men
are the man you saw in the bathroom.

101
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:45,445
Take your time.
Look real carefully.

102
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:57,461
Make sure.
Are you sure?

103
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:00,960
Okay.

104
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:05,302
- Three dogs to stay.
- Thank you.

105
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:17,515
- These we call Wurst.
- Good, good.

106
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:53,427
Your sister said
you don't have a family.

107
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,225
No, I don't.

108
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:02,650
She thinks you should have
children of your own, -

109
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:06,530
- instead of trying
to be a father to hers.

110
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:10,410
Except she thinks you're afraid
of the responsibility.

111
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:18,210
- That's interesting. Anything else?
- Yeah...

112
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:24,462
She says she thinks you like policing
because you think you're always right.

113
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,635
And that you're the only one
who can do anything.

114
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:34,056
And that, when you drink a lot of beer,
you say things like:

115
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:41,356
"None of the other police know a crook
from a bag of... elbows."

116
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:46,778
I believe that's what she said.

117
00:25:49,374 --> 00:25:51,413
Good appetite.

118
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:10,601
Captain, Sgt. Carter for you
on line 23.

119
00:26:13,524 --> 00:26:16,609
Hey, how are you doing?

120
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,621
- I don't know.
- Little boy... He's shy.

121
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:12,584
Hey, knock it off!

122
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,170
I'll get it.

123
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:15,758
- Hi, Kathy.
- Dad!

124
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:19,683
- Hello, Marilyn.
- Hi, John.

125
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:28,984
It's McFee, Paul. He's one of them.
Positive ID from the Amish kid.

126
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:35,902
- McFee? Lieutenant, Narcotics?
- Right.

127
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:40,281
I hope you don't have any doubt
about that.

128
00:29:40,498 --> 00:29:46,501
It fits. Four years ago, Narcotics runs
a raid in which, among other things, -

129
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:50,164
- 550 gallons of this P2P stuff
is confiscated.

130
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:53,084
They put it in Police Storage.

131
00:29:53,303 --> 00:29:56,304
Philadelphia supplies
all the major cities with speed.

132
00:29:56,515 --> 00:30:02,186
They need this P2P stuff to make it.
They pay up to $5,000 a pint for it.

133
00:30:02,396 --> 00:30:05,232
I call Police Storage...

134
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:08,811
No record of ten 55-gallon drums
of P2P.

135
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:11,947
That's $22 million.

136
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:15,950
Guess who ran the raid four years ago.

137
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:20,373
McFee...
Have you talked to him about it?

138
00:30:20,582 --> 00:30:23,370
No. Vacation. Florida.

139
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:28,913
- What do you need to clean this up?
- People from outside the department.

140
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:32,752
Put some guys on McFee.
Watch him, wait him out.

141
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:36,138
FBl, or maybe someone from Treasury.
I'll take care of that.

142
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,143
I want maximum security on this.
The boy's gonna have to be moved.

143
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,977
- Who else knows about this?
- Just you and I.

144
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:46,127
Get back! Police!
Back in the elevator!

145
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:53,047
- That's our car!
- Get in the elevator, you idiot!

146
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:03,854
I know you, asshole!

147
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,559
John says you have to leave now.
He says it's urgent. Dress quickly.

148
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:45,899
John?

149
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:51,903
Put my car in the garage
and close the door.

150
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,830
- I don't understand any of this.
- You don't know anything, okay?

151
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:01,372
I borrowed your car. I didn't say why.

152
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:05,374
You never heard of that woman
and her boy.

153
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:11,015
- John, please tell me why.
- Just do it.

154
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:16,849
- You said we'd be safe in Philadelphia.
- Well, I was wrong.

155
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:26,941
Did you deliver the kid's interview
to Schaeffer?

156
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:31,488
- No.
- I want all the paperwork to disappear.

157
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:35,833
- Tonight, you understand?
- Do you know what you're asking?

158
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:41,002
Just do it. I'm gonna disappear
for a couple of days.

159
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:46,008
- John, what is happening?
- I'll call you when I can.

160
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:51,892
And, partner, watch your back.
Schaeffer's in this thing too.

161
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:17,242
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Working late, man.

162
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,592
That's it.

163
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:51,247
Hey, Fergie...
I told you I hit him.

164
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:56,119
He's in trouble. I want to help him.
We just need to know where he is.

165
00:34:56,337 --> 00:35:01,249
- What kind of trouble?
- A police matter. Don't worry about it.

166
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:07,721
You're saying he's involved
in something illegal?

167
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:10,686
Anybody who knows John
knows that's a goddamn lie.

168
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:16,400
Of course it is. But as long as there's
any doubt, it's better he clear his name.

169
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,647
It's better you should get off my porch.

170
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:25,902
I don't want to have to take you in.
He left with the Amish woman, right?

171
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:35,706
- She say where he is?
- She doesn't know. What about Carter?

172
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:39,374
Tight... but I'm working on him.

173
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:06,788
Samuel!

174
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,379
You should rest.
I'll make us some coffee.

175
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,805
No, I can't stay.

176
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:43,322
- Will you be taking Samuel to trial?
- There isn't gonna be any trial.

177
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:52,252
Rachel, what happened?
Who was that man?

178
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:32,914
- Why didn't you go to a hospital?
- No doctor.

179
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:36,168
They have to report gunshot wounds.

180
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:41,047
If they make a report, they find me.
And if they find me, they find the boy.

181
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,487
- Is the English dead?
- No.

182
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:38,986
He's upstairs.

183
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,049
I feel burning.

184
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:11,352
The bullet entered there
and came out there.

185
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,952
There's danger of infection.
He's lost a great deal of blood.

186
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:23,204
I am not a doctor. This man
should be treated in a hospital.

187
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:29,041
- There is nothing I can do for him.
- No! No, he must stay here.

188
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,259
What if he dies? The sheriff will come.
They'll say we broke the laws.

189
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:40,466
Then we must pray that he doesn't die.
If he does, no one must know.

190
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:43,770
But this is a man's life.
We hold it in our hands.

191
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,481
God help me, I know that, Eli.

192
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:52,071
But if he is found, the people who
did this to him will come get Samuel.

193
00:39:56,954 --> 00:40:03,871
Then make a poultice, three parts milk,
two parts linseed oil, for the infection.

194
00:40:04,086 --> 00:40:09,246
I will send Mary by with some teas
I will brew myself.

195
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,795
Thank you.

196
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:30,904
- I'll have to speak with the elders.
- As you see fit.

197
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:56,998
You prick...

198
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,789
Don't do it.

199
00:42:01,004 --> 00:42:03,756
I'll fucking kill you.

200
00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:06,005
You asshole...

201
00:42:24,946 --> 00:42:26,820
John.

202
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:31,988
John.

203
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:20,085
Are you saying there's no way
we can locate this woman?

204
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,583
We're talking about
20th-century law enforcement.

205
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:30,089
There's your problem. Your Amishman
doesn't live or think in the 20th century.

206
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:33,678
If the Amish have taken your man in,
he won't be easy to find.

207
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:37,763
The problem is, about every third
Amishman around here is named Lapp.

208
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:43,773
And we've got 14,000 Amishmen
just in this county...

209
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:48,201
That's very interesting, Sergeant,
but this is a very important matter.

210
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:51,780
It involves the murder
of a police officer.

211
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:58,618
- There must be some sort of directory.
- Sure. Tax rolls, voter registration...

212
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:01,757
But I don't have the manpower
to send a deputy -

213
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:04,922
- to every Lapp farm in the county.

214
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:10,643
- Maybe you could use the telephone.
- Yeah, maybe I could...

215
00:44:10,852 --> 00:44:13,688
But since the Amish don't have phones,
I wouldn't know who to call.

216
00:44:15,983 --> 00:44:19,731
Thank you, Sergeant.
It's been an education.

217
00:44:40,968 --> 00:44:44,669
- Who are they?
- The leadership of our district.

218
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:47,806
They decided to come see you
for themselves.

219
00:44:48,016 --> 00:44:52,928
Except Stoltzfus. He came the first day.
I think he saved your life.

220
00:44:53,147 --> 00:44:56,065
No, that was not I.

221
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,022
- Who else knows I'm here?
- No one.

222
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,484
- How long have I been here?
- Two days.

223
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,119
Rest, Mr Book. That's the ticket.

224
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:15,462
And drink my tea.
Lots of my tea.

225
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:30,514
- Tell him his tea stinks.
- You can tell him when you're able.

226
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:42,826
We're happy you'll live. We didn't know
what we'd do with you if you died.

227
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:58,758
It's not our place
to ask how he came to us.

228
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:41,841
Don't move!

229
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,723
What are you doing?

230
00:46:51,192 --> 00:46:54,525
Come here, Samuel.
Sit down.

231
00:46:57,698 --> 00:47:02,277
This is a loaded gun.
This is very, very dangerous.

232
00:47:02,495 --> 00:47:06,540
Never, ever, touch a loaded gun.

233
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:12,332
Now I'm taking the bullets out.
Now it's safe. Okay?

234
00:47:13,173 --> 00:47:17,966
- Okay, Mr Book.
- Look, you can call me John.

235
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:22,557
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

236
00:47:23,517 --> 00:47:27,930
It's all right for you to look at it
now. It's unloaded. It's safe.

237
00:47:28,147 --> 00:47:34,685
You wanna handle it, you can handle it,
while I'm here. But that's not right.

238
00:47:46,251 --> 00:47:48,920
Samuel, wait for me downstairs.

239
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:59,924
John Book, while you are in this house,
I insist that you respect our ways.

240
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:06,060
Here, take it. Put it somewhere
where he won't find it.

241
00:48:20,371 --> 00:48:25,033
This gun of the hand
is for the taking of human life.

242
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:30,163
We believe it is wrong to take life.

243
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:33,299
That is only for God.

244
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:41,132
Many times the wars have come,
and people have said to us:

245
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:44,803
"You must fight, you must kill."

246
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:48,356
"It is the only way
to preserve the good."

247
00:48:49,903 --> 00:48:51,942
But Samuel...

248
00:48:53,281 --> 00:48:57,148
There is never only one way.
Remember that.

249
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:02,905
Would you kill another man?

250
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:06,079
I would only kill a bad man.

251
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:10,090
Only the bad man, I see.

252
00:49:10,299 --> 00:49:14,000
And you know these bad men by sight?

253
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:19,808
You are able to look into their hearts
and see this badness?

254
00:49:20,018 --> 00:49:25,393
I can see what they do.
I have seen it.

255
00:49:25,608 --> 00:49:31,194
And having seen, you become
one of them. Don't you understand?

256
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:34,652
What you take into your hands...

257
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:39,289
...you take into your heart.

258
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:47,041
"Wherefore come out from
among them, and be ye separate, -

259
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:49,545
- saith the Lord."

260
00:49:52,095 --> 00:49:55,429
"And touch not the unclean thing."

261
00:49:57,934 --> 00:50:02,679
- Go and finish your chores now.
- Yes, Grandfather.

262
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:19,953
- Enjoying your reading?
- Yeah, I'm learning a lot about manure.

263
00:50:21,126 --> 00:50:23,332
Very interesting.

264
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:29,879
What's that?

265
00:50:31,053 --> 00:50:34,802
Your clothes were stained with blood.
You can wear these.

266
00:50:37,893 --> 00:50:41,512
- They're your husband's?
- Yes.

267
00:50:41,731 --> 00:50:44,519
It's good that someone
can have the use of them.

268
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:48,946
Besides, in your clothes
you'd stand out to strangers.

269
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:57,112
I should tell you that
this kind of coat doesn't have buttons.

270
00:50:57,957 --> 00:51:02,002
- See? Hooks and eyes.
- Something wrong with buttons?

271
00:51:02,211 --> 00:51:07,633
Buttons are Hochmut.
Proud, vain. It's not plain.

272
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:11,799
Got anything against zippers?

273
00:51:13,182 --> 00:51:17,180
- Are you making fun of me?
- No.

274
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:26,153
Like the tourists...
staring all the time.

275
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:32,360
Sometimes they come into the yard.
It's very rude.

276
00:51:34,413 --> 00:51:38,458
- They seem to think we're quaint.
- I can't imagine why they'd think that.

277
00:51:40,503 --> 00:51:42,579
Is there a phone somewhere near?

278
00:51:45,717 --> 00:51:49,252
The Gunthers across the valley.
They're Mennonites.

279
00:51:49,471 --> 00:51:53,801
- They have cars, refrigerators...
- I mean a pay phone, a public phone.

280
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,599
The store at Strasburg, but you won't
be going to Strasburg for a while.

281
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,142
I'm going this morning.

282
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,694
- But Stoltzfus said...
- Yeah, I know what he said.

283
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:15,539
You can go with Eli.
He's taking Samuel to school.

284
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,460
- But you'd better hurry.
- Rachel...

285
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:24,466
Nothing.

286
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,028
What?

287
00:52:53,123 --> 00:52:58,035
- Hurry up, John Book.
- You'd better get going.

288
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:02,289
Hurry up, John Book.

289
00:53:03,843 --> 00:53:07,176
My gun. I need my gun.

290
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:24,781
Thanks.

291
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:30,284
The bullets?
It's not much good without them.

292
00:53:31,498 --> 00:53:33,158
Of course.

293
00:53:44,094 --> 00:53:45,754
Thank you.

294
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,394
How do I look?
I mean, do I look Amish?

295
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,479
- You look plain.
- Okay.

296
00:54:56,923 --> 00:55:00,458
- Carter.
- Partner, are you okay?

297
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:02,469
Yeah. You?

298
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:08,552
- I'm coming in. How hot am I?
- Too hot. Don't do it.

299
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:13,976
- Don't come in. They're looking for you.
- And the kid. I have to make a move.

300
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:20,312
John, don't do it. You couldn't get
within a mile of Schaeffer right now.

301
00:55:20,531 --> 00:55:23,901
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

302
00:55:25,453 --> 00:55:27,696
What are we gonna do? FBl?

303
00:55:28,665 --> 00:55:34,336
- Maybe.
- What about an investigative reporter?

304
00:55:34,547 --> 00:55:37,299
No, they'd want to talk to the kid.

305
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:41,671
Listen, I'll make a couple of calls,
let you know when you can come in.

306
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:46,431
- I've got to go. Take care of yourself.
- Yeah, you too.

307
00:56:19,094 --> 00:56:20,423
Here...

308
00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:25,715
Don't put them in the peaches.

309
00:56:29,648 --> 00:56:32,353
See this stream?
It goes to the wheel -

310
00:56:32,568 --> 00:56:36,815
- and it makes the wheel turn around.
Then it goes...

311
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:44,409
It makes this wire
pump the pump over there, -

312
00:56:44,622 --> 00:56:50,495
- into the well, and the well's water
goes into the house.

313
00:56:54,591 --> 00:56:59,052
This place really echoes.
Hello!

314
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:02,677
- What's up there?
- Corn.

315
00:57:04,435 --> 00:57:07,140
Would you like to hold my kitten?

316
00:57:07,355 --> 00:57:10,440
I'll show you how to do a back rub.

317
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:17,104
You hold them like that, push their
head back, and you rub their neck.

318
00:57:24,623 --> 00:57:27,909
Book?
Is that you, Book?

319
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,621
What are you doing there?

320
00:57:39,682 --> 00:57:42,173
I'm just trying to get the car started.

321
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:46,521
If you are well enough to do that,
you can do work for me.

322
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,518
Yeah. What can I do?

323
00:57:50,526 --> 00:57:55,438
Milking, maybe...
Cows, you know. Cows.

324
00:57:56,324 --> 00:57:58,650
Yeah, I've seen pictures.

325
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:01,574
Good. You start tomorrow.

326
00:58:22,644 --> 00:58:25,681
It's 4:30, time for milking.

327
00:58:51,008 --> 00:58:56,251
Milking stool, milking hat.
There's the milk.

328
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:08,901
Firm grip.
Pinch the top off and squeeze.

329
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:15,367
- Didn't you hear me? Squeeze.
- I am squeezing.

330
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:20,198
You never had your hands
on a teat before.

331
00:59:20,414 --> 00:59:22,123
Not one this big.

332
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:35,381
Hey, I got it!
I got it!

333
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,642
I think.

334
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:54,275
Samuel, help him.

335
01:00:12,638 --> 01:00:17,514
- No, no, no...
- Eat. What's wrong with your appetite?

336
01:00:17,727 --> 01:00:23,267
- I'm not used to eating at this time.
- You're not used to hard work.

337
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,978
Rachel.

338
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:29,899
Samuel...

339
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:35,996
"Honey, that is great coffee."

340
01:00:37,832 --> 01:00:43,289
It's... a joke.
It's a commercial.

341
01:00:45,131 --> 01:00:46,792
On television.

342
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:06,189
- Book, is it?
- Yeah.

343
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,148
- You are the Yankee they talk about.
- I thought I was the English.

344
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:16,410
English, Yankee, it is the same.
My name is Daniel.

345
01:01:16,624 --> 01:01:19,495
- Daniel Hochleitner.
- How do you do?

346
01:01:23,757 --> 01:01:28,085
You look plain, Book.
Very plain.

347
01:01:30,513 --> 01:01:32,506
I came to see Rachel.

348
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:57,891
Eli said I could use his tools
and try to fix that bird house.

349
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:08,239
- I brought you some lemonade.
- Oh, great.

350
01:03:19,214 --> 01:03:20,543
Thanks.

351
01:03:27,557 --> 01:03:31,340
- What happened to Hochleitner?
- He went home.

352
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:35,016
He's a friend of the family.
He's like a son to Eli.

353
01:03:39,235 --> 01:03:45,737
- You know carpentry.
- Yeah, a bit.

354
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:48,656
Can you do anything else?

355
01:03:51,374 --> 01:03:54,043
Whacking.
I'm hell at whacking.

356
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,122
Whacking is not much use on a farm.

357
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:07,795
Tomorrow
I'll let out those trousers for you.

358
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:11,136
Good.

359
01:04:18,778 --> 01:04:24,069
- I told Eli you're a carpenter.
- Hold this up closer, will you?

360
01:04:26,787 --> 01:04:31,745
He said you could come
to Zook's barn-raising.

361
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,165
If I'm still here.

362
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,505
Great.

363
01:04:46,308 --> 01:04:50,140
...presenting golden oldies.
We've gotsome great ones coming up.

364
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:53,390
Here's one that takes me back.

365
01:04:58,237 --> 01:05:01,737
This is great. This is the best.

366
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:05,568
Don't know much...

367
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:13,621
don't know much
about the French I took...

368
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:49,660
...could be with you
what a wonderful world...

369
01:05:55,966 --> 01:05:58,540
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

370
01:06:03,266 --> 01:06:06,800
I can win your love for me

371
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:12,227
don't know much about history
don't know much...

372
01:06:23,537 --> 01:06:28,698
...that l love you
and I know that if you love me too

373
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:33,166
what a wonderful world this would be.

374
01:06:52,944 --> 01:06:54,486
Rachel!

375
01:07:28,649 --> 01:07:33,312
Rachel, what is it with you?
Is this the Ordnung?

376
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:37,148
I've obeyed the rules of the Ordnung.

377
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:42,408
You bring this man to our house,
with his gun of the hand.

378
01:07:42,622 --> 01:07:47,498
You bring fear to this house. Fear
of English with guns coming after him.

379
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:52,919
- I've committed no sin.
- Maybe... Maybe not yet.

380
01:07:53,134 --> 01:07:58,591
But Rachel, it does not look...
You know there has been talk.

381
01:07:58,807 --> 01:08:02,259
Talk about going to the Bishop
and having you shunned.

382
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:06,262
- That is idle talk.
- Oh, do not take it lightly.

383
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:12,646
They can do it.
They can do it just like that.

384
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:18,116
You know what it means, shunning?

385
01:08:19,621 --> 01:08:26,039
I cannot sit at table with you.
I cannot take a thing from your hand.

386
01:08:26,253 --> 01:08:29,539
I cannot go to worship with you.

387
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:37,219
- Oh child, do not go so far.
- I am not a child.

388
01:08:37,432 --> 01:08:41,346
- But you are acting like one.
- I will be the judge of that.

389
01:08:41,561 --> 01:08:47,481
They will be the judge of that,
and so will I, if you shame me.

390
01:08:48,944 --> 01:08:50,486
You shame yourself.

391
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:06,499
Why don't you tell me where he is?
You know, don't you?

392
01:09:10,593 --> 01:09:13,083
I just want to talk to him.

393
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:16,551
I want to talk some sense into him.

394
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:21,054
You know, we go way back.

395
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,762
John and I were a team once.

396
01:09:25,024 --> 01:09:27,183
Like you two are now.

397
01:09:29,613 --> 01:09:31,522
I trained him.

398
01:09:33,242 --> 01:09:36,409
He is a fine policeman.

399
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:43,835
I know he's with the Amish.

400
01:09:46,547 --> 01:09:49,881
God, I'd give anything to see him now.

401
01:09:52,554 --> 01:09:56,054
Can you see John at a prayer meeting?

402
01:10:05,944 --> 01:10:08,352
We're like the Amish.

403
01:10:09,448 --> 01:10:14,109
We're a cult too.
Well... a club.

404
01:10:15,203 --> 01:10:20,993
With our own rules.
John has broken those rules.

405
01:10:23,546 --> 01:10:26,251
As you're breaking them now.

406
01:11:01,962 --> 01:11:07,040
- I hear you're a carpenter.
- Well, it's been a while.

407
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:10,463
No matter.
We can always use a good one.

408
01:11:11,306 --> 01:11:14,722
Hurry up! We have a barn to raise,
and a day to do it!

409
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:25,111
Good luck.

410
01:11:26,363 --> 01:11:29,982
Your hole is better now?

411
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:33,072
Yeah, it's pretty much healed.

412
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:36,823
Good. Then you can go home.

413
01:16:56,511 --> 01:17:01,007
Everyone has an idea about you
and the Englishman, Book.

414
01:17:01,224 --> 01:17:04,225
All of them charitable, I'm sure.

415
01:17:04,436 --> 01:17:06,725
Hardly any of them.

416
01:17:25,084 --> 01:17:27,539
John... Amos.

417
01:17:31,048 --> 01:17:35,509
This is Lydia and Amos.
John Book.

418
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:38,555
It's their barn that you built today.

419
01:17:38,764 --> 01:17:42,928
- We just got married.
- That's great.

420
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:31,445
Rachel...

421
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:55,141
Rachel...

422
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:03,396
If we'd made love last night,
I'd have to stay.

423
01:21:06,697 --> 01:21:09,270
Or you'd have to leave.

424
01:21:27,303 --> 01:21:31,253
Get off the bus, everybody.
Welcome to Amish country.

425
01:21:31,474 --> 01:21:35,519
This is the most famous
Amish grocery store in the area.

426
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:41,187
Stay close together, 'cause we're
only gonna be here another 15 minutes.

427
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:46,822
Be careful photographing the Amish,
they don't like it. You can sneak a few.

428
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:50,733
- All right? Stay together.
- Young man!

429
01:21:50,953 --> 01:21:56,540
We're just here for the day. Can I take
your picture? Stand still, fix your hat...

430
01:21:56,751 --> 01:22:01,212
Lady, you take my picture, I'll rip your
brassiere off and strangle you with it.

431
01:22:02,549 --> 01:22:04,043
You got that?

432
01:22:06,845 --> 01:22:09,929
Did you hear
what that Amish just said to me?

433
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:14,511
- Homicide.
- Elton Carter.

434
01:22:14,728 --> 01:22:17,516
- Who's calling?
- A friend.

435
01:22:20,026 --> 01:22:23,110
Salazar, Public Relations.
Can I help you?

436
01:22:23,321 --> 01:22:27,189
I'm trying to reach Sgt. Elton Carter.

437
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:32,617
- Are you a member of the family?
- What? No, I'm a friend.

438
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:37,375
Then I regret to inform you
Sgt. Carter is dead.

439
01:22:37,587 --> 01:22:42,165
He died last night, killed in the line
of duty. Should you require...

440
01:23:06,576 --> 01:23:09,198
Hello..? Yes.

441
01:23:10,289 --> 01:23:11,617
Paul!

442
01:23:14,209 --> 01:23:19,666
- Paul, it's John Book.
- I'll take it in the study.

443
01:23:24,345 --> 01:23:25,674
How are you, John?

444
01:23:34,356 --> 01:23:36,349
Hello, John.

445
01:23:39,612 --> 01:23:44,024
Calling me at home.
I can't trace the call. That's very smart.

446
01:23:44,241 --> 01:23:47,242
- Lost the meaning, didn't you, Paul?
- What?

447
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:51,321
Isn't that what you used to say
about dirty cops?

448
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:56,583
Somewhere along the way
they lost the meaning.

449
01:23:56,797 --> 01:24:01,792
- We know where you are. We're...
- You got it wrong. I'm coming for you.

450
01:24:02,011 --> 01:24:06,424
I like your style, John.
I've always liked your style.

451
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:10,888
I'm gonna do to you whatever you did
to Zenovich and Carter.

452
01:24:11,104 --> 01:24:14,520
I'm gonna fucking do that to you,
you asshole!

453
01:24:30,542 --> 01:24:35,251
- You're blocking the fucking road!
- I can't back this up.

454
01:24:35,464 --> 01:24:38,299
- Just give it a shot.
- Look...

455
01:24:38,509 --> 01:24:41,130
It takes a half hour...

456
01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:51,266
It happens sometimes.
Do nothing.

457
01:24:53,608 --> 01:24:56,977
- Come on.
- Come on, Goldilocks.

458
01:24:58,113 --> 01:25:02,692
- Don't you speak English?
- You don't hear very good, do you?

459
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:12,997
- On the chin! On the chin!
- You look better, buddy.

460
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:19,131
Come on down.
Are you a man or what?

461
01:25:19,344 --> 01:25:23,045
That's right, no fighting.
They won't fight for our country, either.

462
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:27,215
- It's not our way.
- But it's my way.

463
01:25:27,436 --> 01:25:29,892
Book, no!

464
01:25:32,817 --> 01:25:37,111
- Check this out.
- Here comes another one.

465
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:45,113
- It's all right, Book.
- He's gonna hit you with his Bible.

466
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:52,452
You're making a mistake.

467
01:26:30,879 --> 01:26:35,957
- Never seen anything like it in my life.
- He's from Ohio. My cousin.

468
01:26:36,177 --> 01:26:39,629
Them Ohio Amish must be different.

469
01:26:39,848 --> 01:26:43,893
Here, they don't have fight in them.

470
01:26:44,102 --> 01:26:48,599
Good day to you, Mr Lapp.
This ain't good for the tourist trade!

471
01:26:48,816 --> 01:26:51,650
Tell that to your Ohio friends!

472
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:57,150
A kid broke his nose.
He was with old Eli Lapp.

473
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:14,378
- Where did you get that?
- Book gave it to me.

474
01:27:16,471 --> 01:27:19,756
He said it was a special present.

475
01:27:38,327 --> 01:27:41,447
Samuel, time for bed.

476
01:27:44,542 --> 01:27:48,706
Samuel...
You can take the toy with you.

477
01:28:11,613 --> 01:28:14,567
He's leaving, isn't he?

478
01:28:14,783 --> 01:28:20,027
Tomorrow morning.
He'll need his city clothes.

479
01:28:20,248 --> 01:28:23,782
Why? What's he going back to?
Nothing.

480
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:29,340
He's going back to his world,
where he belongs.

481
01:28:29,549 --> 01:28:34,591
He knows it...
and you know it too.

482
01:32:51,248 --> 01:32:53,205
It's all right, we're police officers.

483
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:56,204
Check the rest of the house.

484
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:59,706
It's all right, we're police officers.

485
01:32:59,924 --> 01:33:02,213
Philadelphia Police.

486
01:33:02,427 --> 01:33:07,634
It's all right, Mrs Lapp. Just sit down.
It's going to be all right.

487
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:13,638
We're not going to harm your boy.
It's Book we want.

488
01:33:13,855 --> 01:33:15,812
Now where is he?

489
01:33:27,871 --> 01:33:29,329
Book!

490
01:33:34,044 --> 01:33:35,537
Fergie, come on!
Come on!

491
01:33:51,187 --> 01:33:53,939
What is it?
What are they doing?

492
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:12,116
I want you to go to Hochleitner's farm
as fast as you can.

493
01:34:12,335 --> 01:34:14,873
- And stay there.
- Will they kill you?

494
01:34:15,088 --> 01:34:18,172
- I'll be all right.
- But you don't have your gun.

495
01:34:19,676 --> 01:34:22,001
Run, Samuel. Run!

496
01:34:43,618 --> 01:34:45,113
Shit...

497
01:35:04,808 --> 01:35:06,137
Come on!

498
01:35:12,357 --> 01:35:14,813
Come on! Come on!

499
01:39:25,088 --> 01:39:26,713
Fergie!

500
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:35,218
Fuck!

501
01:39:42,774 --> 01:39:44,317
McFee!

502
01:39:55,955 --> 01:39:58,742
McFee! Fergie!

503
01:40:17,145 --> 01:40:19,552
- What's wrong?
- I can't figure it out.

504
01:40:19,772 --> 01:40:23,224
- Where's Fergie?
- I don't know. You better come on up.

505
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:52,716
Come on.
We're going outside. Come on.

506
01:41:06,156 --> 01:41:07,484
Come on!

507
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:00,503
Schaeffer!

508
01:42:30,037 --> 01:42:33,157
Stop the boy ringing that bell.

509
01:42:33,374 --> 01:42:36,744
I want you to stop the boy
ringing that bell. Stop him now!

510
01:42:46,973 --> 01:42:50,389
- Let her go, Paul!
- Put the gun down!

511
01:42:50,602 --> 01:42:54,386
- I'll fucking blow you away!
- I will blow her head off.

512
01:42:55,106 --> 01:42:58,605
- The fucking gun is down!
- You really fucked up!

513
01:42:58,818 --> 01:43:01,819
Let her go, the gun's down!

514
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:05,150
- Put that gun down!
- The gun's down.

515
01:43:05,367 --> 01:43:08,571
It's down, it's down. Don't hurt her.

516
01:43:43,158 --> 01:43:49,446
It's all right, Rachel.
Rachel, just move... Go!

517
01:43:58,674 --> 01:44:03,384
It's all right, I'm a police officer.
The man's wanted for murder.

518
01:44:04,681 --> 01:44:08,631
- Now stand back.
- What are you gonna do? Kill me?

519
01:44:08,852 --> 01:44:12,637
Are you gonna shoot him?
Are you gonna shoot him?

520
01:44:12,857 --> 01:44:16,475
Is that what you're gonna do, Paul?
Him? The woman? Me?

521
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:27,908
It's over! Enough!
Enough!

522
01:44:30,167 --> 01:44:31,542
Enough.

523
01:46:21,328 --> 01:46:23,286
Goodbye, John Book.

524
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:28,919
Goodbye, Samuel.

525
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,085
You be careful
out among them English.
