00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:13,350
Ha ha ha!

331
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:18,135
Come on, tuck.

332
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:20,533
I don't believe
I live here.

333
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:23,429
My car's out back.
I'll drive you home.

334
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,297
And if you're
a good boy,

335
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:29,654
I'll help get your car back
in the morning.

336
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:32,550
Never turn down
an offer like that

337
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,938
from a beautiful woman,
right, hoyt?

338
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,856
Never.

339
00:16:36,856 --> 00:16:38,774
Say good night,
tuck.

340
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:40,222
Good night.

341
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:43,109
Tell boots
if I get a chance

342
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,257
I'll stop by
and see him.

343
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:47,415
Thank you
for your help.

344
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:50,187
Does he still
take his ball home

345
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:53,543
when he doesn't
get his way?

346
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:57,140
Look, it was nice of you
to get US out of that bar--

347
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,556
we owe you for that--

348
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:02,903
but I don't have to listen
to you knock my fiance

349
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:05,541
and my mind for the way
I think about things.

350
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:09,492
US simpletons must have
bored you to death tonight.

351
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:11,909
Hey, Maggie...

352
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:15,860
Did you know when you get
all hot and bothered,

353
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,277
your chest just
turns bright red?

354
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,016
"...and bending down
beside the glowing bars,

355
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:45,821
"murmur, a little sadly,
how love fled,

356
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,218
"paced upon the mountains
overhead

357
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:54,107
and hid his face
amid a crowd of stars."

358
00:17:56,504 --> 00:17:58,422
Miss Reed...

359
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,582
Since you insist
upon polluting

360
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,989
the rarified atmosphere
of my classroom

361
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,898
with that noxious weed,

362
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:10,775
I insist that you
hand me that pack

363
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:14,131
so I may do the same.

364
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:15,589
[Laughter]

365
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,457
As miss Reed
is no doubt aware,

366
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:21,334
all is not passion
and sea mist

367
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,741
and leering god
with the Irish.

368
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:25,189
William Butler yeats--

369
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,577
a Mick jerk.

370
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:29,016
[Laughter]

371
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,382
Mr. Foley...

372
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,310
Yes, sir?

373
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,657
Is there something
about Mr. Yeats' poem

374
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,095
that you appreciated

375
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:43,421
and would like to share
with the rest of the class?

376
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:49,175
No, sir, Mr. Flournoy,
nothing in particular.

377
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,613
No. No, sir.

378
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:52,062
Hmm.

379
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:54,708
Mr. Claibourne? Boots?

380
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:57,097
How about you?

381
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,453
There's a lot of charm

382
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:02,381
in the sentimental
description.

383
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,308
It's romantic
melodrama, really.

384
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,217
If you cut
through that,

385
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:08,135
you get to
something else,

386
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,533
something deeper,
less romantic.

387
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:14,388
Truth is, no one wants
to be alone without love,

388
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,776
whether you're old
or young.

389
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:22,070
What do you think,
Mr. Flournoy?

390
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,335
♪ Come on, baby,
let the good times roll ♪

391
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:30,692
♪ come on, baby,

392
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:33,108
♪ come on, baby,

393
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:35,976
You could do
a damn sight better

394
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,894
than that
beautiful boots.

395
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,822
Aiken, don't start
this again.

396
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:41,749
He is
rather gorgeous.

397
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,097
I've thought about
how good he'd be in bed.

398
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:46,056
Aiken!

399
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:49,412
Let's get some fries
and a shake.

400
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,349
Looks like Delia's
going after tuck.

401
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,737
If jenks knew...

402
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:55,656
If jenks knew, nothing.

403
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:57,574
The guy is
a cheerleader.

404
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,981
What does that tell you
about his mind?

405
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,868
Jenks and Delia,
they're everybody's ideal--

406
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:04,776
Randolph's
Romeo and Juliet.

407
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:07,308
If that's true, then
Romeo probably has the IQ

408
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:09,705
of an argyle sock.

409
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:11,978
And Juliet
could pull a train

410
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,980
longer than the population
of fort benning

411
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,982
and come back
begging for more.

412
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:18,941
Oh!

413
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:20,389
I know.

414
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,902
The pot calling
the kettle black, right?

415
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,798
Difference is,
I'm honest.

416
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:26,863
I don't tease.

417
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:28,781
Anyway,
I've often thought

418
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:30,593
that tuck was
interesting.

419
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,981
I wonder
if a real woman

420
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:35,878
would scare
the pants off him.

421
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:39,110
Hi, Maggie!

422
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,539
Hey.

423
00:20:44,135 --> 00:20:45,574
Want a gum ball?

424
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:52,297

00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:53,735

426
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,174
greenwich village.

427
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:59,029
My sister says it's
the most exciting place.

428
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:00,458
Think about it.

429
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:04,294
I got to go.

430
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,670

00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:15,707
You be careful.

435
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,584
Careful? Of what?

Hoyt Cunningham.

What did he have to say

Jenks, don't you think
it would be nice

506
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,295
if you treated me the same way
in front of your friends

507
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:03,172
as you did
when we were alone?

508
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:06,548
I suppose that would be
a pretty good idea.

509
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,977
Boots, please!

510
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:10,374
What the hell's
wrong with you?

511
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,302
Take a lock,
mister!

512
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,750
Oops!

513
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,495
Well, I'll just be
right back.

514
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:23,350
I love you, Dee.

515
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:25,738
I love you,
jenks.

516
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:35,578
Hey!

517
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:37,976
What the hell's
wrong with you?

518
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,894
Come on,
let's go party!

519
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:42,790
Brothers
in the bond, boots!

520
00:25:43,145 --> 00:25:44,583
Hi, Maggie, darling.

521
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,022
Hey, mama kidd.

522
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:47,470
Hi, Delia.

523
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:53,704
You two have a fight
or something?

524
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:56,101
Oh, he just thinks
he's god's gift.

525
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:58,518
You'd think
his precious groveland

526
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:00,906
was a holy kingdom
or something.

527
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:02,345
Honey, it is.

528
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:05,222
Jenks went home with
boots over Christmas.

529
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:09,557
He said it was straight
out of <i>gone with the wind.</i>

530
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,465
Racehorses
and everything.

531
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,383
♪ Oh, doo-dah, doo-dah ♪

532
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,822
Maggie deloach...

533
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:17,229
Sometimes I think
you are really crazy.

534
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:18,917
I'd give my heart and soul
to get married

535
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:21,305
and live
in a place like that.

536
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:22,744
You just act
like it's nothing.

537
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:26,100
In the first place,
I haven't seen his Tara,

538
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,558
so I don't know
what it looks like.

539
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:31,500
Second, I haven't
mentioned marriage.

540
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:33,418
Third,
if we got married,

541
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:37,494
we wouldn't live with his
mama and the infamous judge.

542
00:26:37,503 --> 00:26:39,421
Honey, they're
going to die.

543
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:41,464
I mean,
sooner or later.

544
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:44,821
Then you will be
the mistress of groveland.

545
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,758
All those servants.

546
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:49,146
Boots'
beautiful children.

547
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:52,982
Sure seems like a fairy tale
come true to me.

548
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:55,869
Is that really
what you think, Dee?

549
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:57,317
Yes, ma'am.

550
00:26:57,307 --> 00:27:00,185
I mean, it's
just right out there,

551
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,062
and if you
closed your eyes

552
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:04,989
and just reached out,

553
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:06,917
you could get it,

554
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:10,744
just like that gold ring
on the merry-go-round.

555
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:13,141
I mean,
can you really imagine

556
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:15,069
wanting anything else?

557
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:19,864
Now you think
about that, Maggie.

558
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:25,158
You're an Alpha chi delta,
boots says.

559
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:27,067
Oh, that's nice.

560
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:29,464
So many
of our delta girls

561
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:30,903
affiliate
with that sorority.

562
00:27:30,903 --> 00:27:33,780
You're housed in such
a lovely old mansion.

563
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:36,197
But nothing to compare
with groveland.

564
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,064
You and the judge have
the most beautiful home.

565
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:42,900
This is nothing but
a big old pink elephant.

566
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,838
Come on, coralee.

567
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:47,705
Groveland is the best
plantation in the delta,

568
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:50,103
a regular shangri-la,
right, judge?

569
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:52,500
Shangri-la, huh?
Don't you wish.

570
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,438
Whatever's
going to happen

571
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:56,346
to this
shangri-la

572
00:27:56,346 --> 00:27:58,264
after I'm gone,
Maggie,

573
00:27:58,264 --> 00:28:00,182
is anybody's
guess.

574
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:02,589
Courtney, what are
you talking about?

575
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:04,517
This
is boots' place.

576
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:07,385
With the proper help,
he'll rule the roost.

577
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,303
Isn't that right,
judge?

578
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:12,659
Hell, yeah.
I guess so, honey.

579
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:15,182
Maggie, think you
can keep this slug

580
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,068
from pissing it away
after I'm gone?

581
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:19,977
Ha ha ha ha!

582
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:21,895
Hey, judge.
Guess who's back?

583
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,343
Who?

584
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:24,782
Hoyt Cunningham.

585
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:27,189
Can you believe it?

586
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,536
He ran into Maggie
the other night.

587
00:28:31,015 --> 00:28:33,068
How is old hoyt?

588
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:35,465
What's he up to,
Maggie?

589
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,144
I'm not sure.

590
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,541
I ran into him in the--

591
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,469
place where
he was working.

592
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,397
He's a photographer for
one of the wire services.

593
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,785
Boots told me
all about him.

594
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:49,141
As I recall, you did
most of the telling.

595
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:51,558
What exactly
did hoyt say?

596
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:54,426
I guess we did talk
for a time.

597
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:56,823
I found him
fascinating, really.

598
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:59,221
Did you know
that he believes

599
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,117
the negroes are planning
to enroll at Randolph,

600
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,026
trying to integrate?

601
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:05,579
I wouldn't worry
my pretty little head

602
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,018
about that, darling.

603
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:08,936
He's still
talking about

604
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,333
the next
great revolution?

605
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:14,115
Another civil war
fought on the delta?

606
00:29:14,105 --> 00:29:16,023
Is he still
talking crap?

607
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,462
Courtney claibourne...

608
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:19,389
Revolution,
my busted butt.

609
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:22,621
Courtney, I won't have you
talk like that.

610
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:25,508
Don't talk like that
in front of Cleveland.

611
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:28,136
I don't give a damn.
Hey, Cleveland?

612
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:29,095
Yes, sir.

613
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,023
You hear talk
about riots

614
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:32,950
among the hands?

615
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:34,379
No, sir.

616
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:36,297
You thinking
about revolting?

617
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:38,215
Oh, no, sir.

618
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:40,613
That boy
better not come here

619
00:29:40,623 --> 00:29:42,061
spreading
those lies.

620
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:43,509
'Cause ain't nobody

621
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:46,377
treats his niggers
better than I do.

622
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:47,815
Right, Cleveland?

623
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,254
Yes, sir.

624
00:29:59,468 --> 00:30:03,179
You turned on me and
made me look like a fool.

625
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,138
Oh, Maggie--

626
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:06,056
all that stuff
about hoyt Cunningham.

627
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,495
You led me
right into that.

628
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:08,933
Did the trick, too.

629
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:11,830
Got the old man
off my young ass.

630
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,697
I didn't say that
to help you.

631
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:16,615
Why'd you say it then?

632
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:19,013
You're no nigger lover,
are you?

633
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:21,430
You don't have any idea
who I am really.

634
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:25,256
What am I going
to do with you?

635
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:06,150
You're back early.

636
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,017
Thought y'all were
going to Birmingham

637
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:10,935
for dinner
and a show.

638
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,813
Dinner and a show,
my foot.

639
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:17,543
What happened?

640
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:21,379
We never even went anywhere
near Birmingham.

641
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:24,746
Instead, we went
to this cruddy hole,

642
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:27,623
an apartment one of his
fraternity brothers has.

643
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:30,979
Said there was going to be
this party there.

644
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,917
Nobody showed up but me

645
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:35,305
and Mr. Fastest-hands-
in-Alabama.

646
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:38,661
He said he had
something important to ask me

647
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,558
and he wanted
to be alone.

648
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:43,946
What did he
want to ask?

649
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,384
Jesus, Maggie!

650
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:48,261
He asked me
to go all the way.

651
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,189
What did you say?

What are you doing here
at this hour?

1149
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:39,429
I needed some quiet.

1150
01:03:39,544 --> 01:03:40,982
You ok?

1151
01:03:40,992 --> 01:03:44,838
Let's just say
that I had a long night.

1152
01:03:46,506 --> 01:03:47,945
I'm fine.

1153
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:49,499
There you are.

1154
01:03:49,499 --> 01:03:50,937
Morning, tuck.

1155
01:03:50,937 --> 01:03:53,335
I came for you
this morning,

1156
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:55,253
but you weren't there.

1157
01:03:55,262 --> 01:03:56,701
I was here.

1158
01:03:56,701 --> 01:03:58,149
Oh, right.
Of course.

1159
01:04:07,864 --> 01:04:09,782
Aren't you going
to read it?

1160
01:04:10,271 --> 01:04:10,751
Maggie,
not only do I have

1161
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,189
my own editorial
to write,

1162
01:04:12,669 --> 01:04:16,630
I've got about 10 pounds
of galleys to proof.

1163
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,538
I'm sure yours is good.

1164
01:04:18,538 --> 01:04:21,415
I wouldn't dare rewrite you.
I know better.

1165
01:04:21,415 --> 01:04:22,374
I think you better
read it, tuck.

1166
01:04:32,348 --> 01:04:35,705
Y'all want some nestle's
and a glazed doughnut?

1167
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,144
No, thanks.

1168
01:04:38,592 --> 01:04:40,030
Suit yourself.

1169
01:04:54,905 --> 01:04:56,823
I can't run it.

1170
01:04:56,823 --> 01:04:58,262
Why not?

1171
01:04:58,271 --> 01:04:59,710
You know why not.

1172
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,158
The board of directors
will lose their minds.

1173
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:04,505
This isn't the newspaper
speaking out. It's me.

1174
01:05:04,745 --> 01:05:06,183
Maggie, I got
my young ass in a ringer

1175
01:05:06,183 --> 01:05:08,101
over that simple piece
that you wrote

1176
01:05:08,111 --> 01:05:09,550
about autherine Lucy!

1177
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,395
This will drive every Dean,
regent, plus the president

1178
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:14,824
straight up
the goddamn wall!

1179
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:16,742
Are you going
to run it or not?

1180
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:22,995
Well, we're going to get
booted out of here,

1181
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:25,863
right off <i>the senator
staff, maybe the school.</i>

1182
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:30,198
Y'all sure
you don't want anything?

1183
01:05:30,188 --> 01:05:31,972
Jean!

1184
01:05:31,982 --> 01:05:33,430
What?

1185
01:05:44,104 --> 01:05:46,022
Maggie, you've thought
about the consequences,

1186
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:47,470
I take it?

1187
01:05:49,868 --> 01:05:52,265
The chi delts,
your parents, boots,

1188
01:05:52,745 --> 01:05:54,663
your degree.

1189
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,998
I want to run
this column.

1190
01:06:01,865 --> 01:06:03,783
Well,
I'll tell you what.

1191
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:06,181
I'll take this before
the board of publications

1192
01:06:06,191 --> 01:06:07,629
on Monday night.

1193
01:06:07,629 --> 01:06:10,516
That's the best
I can do.

1194
01:06:10,506 --> 01:06:11,945
Dean Howard's
on the board, right?

1195
01:06:11,945 --> 01:06:12,904
Yes, he is.

1196
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:15,177
Will you stand up
for me, tuck?

1197
01:06:17,709 --> 01:06:19,627
Honest?

1198
01:06:21,305 --> 01:06:23,223
I don't know.

1199
01:06:24,537 --> 01:06:26,935
I just don't know.

1200
01:06:36,055 --> 01:06:37,494
Maggie.

1201
01:06:38,942 --> 01:06:41,829
This here
is really good.

1202
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:44,936
I wish
I'd written it.

1203
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:48,187
Thanks.

1204
01:07:05,335 --> 01:07:07,732
Hey, sister said
you've been trying

1205
01:07:07,742 --> 01:07:09,190
to reach me
all morning.

1206
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:11,578
Are you ok?

1207
01:07:11,578 --> 01:07:15,174
<i>Comme ci, comme ca.</i>

1208
01:07:15,184 --> 01:07:17,476
Well, what's going on?

1209
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:23,230
I'm pregnant.

1210
01:07:26,223 --> 01:07:29,109
I thought you said
you were using something.

1211
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,538
I was.

1212
01:07:30,538 --> 01:07:31,497
Well, what happened?

1213
01:07:31,497 --> 01:07:34,509
Maggie, diaphragms
don't always work.

1214
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:36,906
Sometimes
they just don't work.

1215
01:07:36,906 --> 01:07:38,345
Sad but true.

1216
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:41,701
You pays your money, and
you takes your chances.

1217
01:07:41,711 --> 01:07:44,118
What are you
going to do?

1218
01:07:44,109 --> 01:07:46,986
That's why
I wanted to see you.

1219
01:07:48,424 --> 01:07:51,781
I'm leaving Randolph.

1220
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:53,718
I wanted
to say good-bye.

1221
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:57,545
I'm going to miss you
very much, Maggie.

1222
01:07:57,545 --> 01:07:59,463
No. You can't leave.

1223
01:07:59,463 --> 01:08:00,422
You don't have
to leave.

1224
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:03,798
Listen. I'm going
to New York.

1225
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,624
My sister's got this cute
apartment and a terrific job

1226
01:08:07,624 --> 01:08:10,501
with an interior
design firm in the city.

1227
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:12,918
She thinks she can
get me a job with her.

1228
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:14,827
But without a husband,

1229
01:08:14,827 --> 01:08:16,745
without a father
for the baby?

1230
01:08:16,745 --> 01:08:18,663
I never wanted
to be married, Maggie.

1231
01:08:18,663 --> 01:08:23,947
Maybe what I'm looking
for really is a man,

1232
01:08:23,947 --> 01:08:25,865
but not any I met
up till now.

1233
01:08:25,865 --> 01:08:26,824
And I don't think
it's a man anyway,

1234
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:31,620
more like something
I'll do myself.

1235
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:33,557
Something sort of great!

1236
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:35,945
You know me, Maggie.

1237
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:36,904
I've always
wanted to think

1238
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,781
I'll be a great woman
someday.

1239
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:42,677
I'll write you
when I get settled.

1240
01:08:43,147 --> 01:08:43,627
Ok?

1241
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:50,829
Can you believe it,
Maggie?

1242
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:54,195
I'm going to be living
in greenwich village.

1243
01:08:57,063 --> 01:08:58,981
Come on.

1244
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:00,918
Help me get packed.

1245
01:09:19,735 --> 01:09:21,413
"X" marks the spot.

1246
01:09:21,902 --> 01:09:24,549
Life starts here.

1247
01:09:26,937 --> 01:09:28,855
Now.

1248
01:09:34,302 --> 01:09:36,355
Good afternoon.

1249
01:09:36,345 --> 01:09:38,263
Come in. Come in.

1250
01:09:38,618 --> 01:09:40,536
Won't you please
be seated?

1251
01:09:42,464 --> 01:09:44,382
Now,
on Monday evening past

1252
01:09:44,382 --> 01:09:47,748
the publication board met,
but you already knew that.

1253
01:09:47,739 --> 01:09:50,616
I knew they met,
yes, Dean Howard.

1254
01:09:50,616 --> 01:09:53,493
I might add
that your editor-in-chief

1255
01:09:53,502 --> 01:09:55,910
placed your opus
before the board

1256
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,339
with considerable passion.

1257
01:09:57,339 --> 01:10:01,654
He said yours was a sane
and eloquent voice on campus

1258
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,582
that deserved to be heard,

1259
01:10:03,582 --> 01:10:05,634
and rightly so.

1260
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:09,461
Fine sentiments,
miss deloach.

1261
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,149
Of course
there have been,

1262
01:10:11,149 --> 01:10:13,556
shall we say,
racial inequities.

1263
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:16,903
I applaud
your sensitivity.

1264
01:10:17,383 --> 01:10:18,821
Thank you.

1265
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:21,238
But here at Randolph
we depend

1266
01:10:21,228 --> 01:10:24,585
on the generous wisdom
of our board of regents

1267
01:10:24,585 --> 01:10:27,942
and on the gracious pocketbooks
of our dedicated alumni.

1268
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:31,317
Shall we get to
the point, Dean Howard?

1269
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,830
The point is...

1270
01:10:33,821 --> 01:10:35,259
That because of the volatile
political atmosphere

1271
01:10:35,259 --> 01:10:36,698
in Alabama today,

1272
01:10:36,698 --> 01:10:40,054
we cannot allow you
to publish this column.

1273
01:10:40,064 --> 01:10:43,430
Would you mind
elaborating

1274
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,099
just a little, sir?

1275
01:10:45,578 --> 01:10:47,976
I'm not quite sure
what you're getting at.

1276
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:51,237
We're dealing with
a very sensitive issue here,

1277
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:53,145
things that go beyond

1278
01:10:53,145 --> 01:10:55,063
your awareness
and understanding.

1279
01:10:55,063 --> 01:10:57,940
You'll just have to trust US
as educators

1280
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,878
to know what's right.

1281
01:10:59,868 --> 01:11:02,131
But can you be more
specific, Dean Howard?

1282
01:11:02,141 --> 01:11:07,310
I could be, but
I choose not to be.

1283
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:09,957
And if we choose
not to trust you

1284
01:11:10,427 --> 01:11:12,825
and publish it
anyway?

1285
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,858
Now you listen to me,
young lady.

1286
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,776
I don't want to burst
your little bubble.

1287
01:11:17,256 --> 01:11:19,653
I don't even want to be
the one to call your daddy

1288
01:11:19,663 --> 01:11:20,622
and tell him
I'm sending you home.

1289
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:22,425
But you know what?

1290
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,343
I won't just
make you resign,

1291
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:27,815
I'll expel your behind so fast,
your head will swim!

1292
01:11:27,815 --> 01:11:29,253
You, too, son!

1293
01:11:34,672 --> 01:11:36,590
Well...

1294
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:39,477
I'm sure that in time,
miss deloach,

1295
01:11:39,467 --> 01:11:40,905
you'll not only see

1296
01:11:40,905 --> 01:11:43,303
what's at stake
for you personally,

1297
01:11:43,543 --> 01:11:47,868
but you'll see the wisdom
of our position as well.

1298
01:11:49,307 --> 01:11:50,860
Am I clear?

1299
01:11:53,258 --> 01:11:56,135
I regret this unpleasantness
had to happen.

1300
01:11:56,615 --> 01:11:59,012
And I apologize for
my choice of language

1301
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:01,429
and for being so brief.

1302
01:12:01,419 --> 01:12:05,495
The junior chamber of commerce
is expecting me for lunch.

1303
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:07,893
If you'll excuse me, then.

1304
01:12:18,107 --> 01:12:20,025
You can take Rhett Butler.

1305
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:22,422
I'm going to marry
Ashley wilkes

1306
01:12:22,432 --> 01:12:25,309
as soon as
Olivia de havilland dies.

1307
01:12:25,309 --> 01:12:28,196
Frankly, m.A.,
I don't give a damn.

1308
01:12:28,186 --> 01:12:31,063
I don't know nothing
about birthing no babies!

1309
01:12:31,063 --> 01:12:32,022
I don't know what
to do with my hair.

1310
01:12:32,032 --> 01:12:34,430
I see curls,
lots of curls.

1311
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,878
Good god,
where have you been?

1312
01:12:35,868 --> 01:12:37,786
Working.
The newspaper.

1313
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,704
Are you crazy?

1314
01:12:39,704 --> 01:12:41,143
The ball starts
in 2 hours,

1315
01:12:41,143 --> 01:12:42,581
and you're still
working?

1316
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:45,717
Dee,
I'm not going.

1317
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,585
Did you and boots
have a fight again?

1318
01:12:48,585 --> 01:12:50,503
It's not about that.

1319
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:53,140
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course you're going.

1320
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:55,797
Maggie, this is the biggest,
most important night

1321
01:12:55,787 --> 01:12:57,705
of my life.

1322
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:59,624
You've got to go.

1323
01:12:59,624 --> 01:13:01,062
I want you
to read something.

1324
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:02,510
Later.
I'll read it later.

1325
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:05,397
Now, Dee, please.

1326
01:13:07,305 --> 01:13:10,662
Well, all right.
Go on! Get in the tub!

1327
01:13:13,549 --> 01:13:14,997
Read it, ok?

1328
01:13:14,987 --> 01:13:16,426
I'm reading.
I'm reading.

1329
01:13:22,775 --> 01:13:25,307
Come on, girls!
Let's get beautiful.

1330
01:13:25,307 --> 01:13:26,745
Keefi, save me.

1331
01:13:26,745 --> 01:13:29,622
I know. Curls.
Lots and lots of curls.

1332
01:13:53,819 --> 01:13:55,258
Hi.

1333
01:13:55,258 --> 01:13:57,176
Hi. Hi.

1334
01:13:57,176 --> 01:14:00,053
There are traditions,
and there are traditions,

1335
01:14:00,062 --> 01:14:03,908
but the coronation
of the honeysuckle queen

1336
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:09,173
here at Randolph
is a tradition of renewal.

1337
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:12,070
Rebirth, you might say,
of a history

1338
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,458
and heritage
we Cherish.

1339
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,376
Like the song says,

1340
01:14:16,376 --> 01:14:19,253
"old times here
are not forgotten.

1341
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:21,190
"Look away,

1342
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:22,619
"look away,

1343
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:25,496
look away, dixieland."

1344
01:14:28,862 --> 01:14:31,749
All the fraternities
have voted.

1345
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:33,178
Your honeysuckle queen--

1346
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:36,535
your honeysuckle queen
for 1957

1347
01:14:36,535 --> 01:14:38,693
is miss Delia June curry!

1348
01:14:47,343 --> 01:14:49,261
Yay, Delia!

1349
01:14:58,621 --> 01:15:00,549
Thank you,

1350
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:05,814
especially to my sisters
at Alpha chi delta.

1351
01:15:05,824 --> 01:15:08,701
When I was hurting,
you were there for me.

1352
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:13,496
You know,
when you mix 100 years

1353
01:15:13,496 --> 01:15:15,414
of tradition,

1354
01:15:15,424 --> 01:15:19,749
gentility, and
good old southern honor...

1355
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:24,055
With friendship,

1356
01:15:24,055 --> 01:15:26,453
you get a way of life
you know in your heart

1357
01:15:26,462 --> 01:15:30,308
you could never
turn your back on,

1358
01:15:30,299 --> 01:15:35,094
because if you betray
that which you say you love,

1359
01:15:35,103 --> 01:15:37,501
you only betray yourself.

I'm sorry.

1384
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,636
Then why don't we have
a talk right now?

1385
01:17:32,826 --> 01:17:37,141
It seems to me like she's taking
a stand for integration.

1386
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,069
Let me see that thing.

1387
01:17:39,069 --> 01:17:41,956
How could you do
something like this?

1388
01:17:41,946 --> 01:17:44,823
This isn't some
kind of joke, is it?

1389
01:17:44,823 --> 01:17:48,180
What am I supposed
to tell these people?

They're our friends.

1391
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:52,505
I knew you would be
hurt by this.

1392
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,423
Don't you see?
I had no choice.

1393
01:17:54,423 --> 01:17:55,382
I needed--

1394
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,269

01:24:10,108 --> 01:24:11,892
May I submit to you

1462
01:24:11,902 --> 01:24:14,309
that when I was
inaugurated governor,

1463
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,217
I took an oath

1464
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:20,197
to uphold and perpetuate
the laws of this great state,

1465
01:24:20,543 --> 01:24:23,909
and I also intend
to fulfill that oath

1466
01:24:23,899 --> 01:24:26,776
to keep this state free
and sovereign.

1467
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:30,517
Yeah!

1468
01:24:30,507 --> 01:24:31,946
Governor!

1469
01:24:31,946 --> 01:24:35,302
Who's running
this state anyway?

1470
01:24:44,912 --> 01:24:46,350
Please, please.

1471
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:48,758
People, go home!

1472
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:52,469
Please! Go home!

1473
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,060
Let's go!

1474
01:25:09,022 --> 01:25:10,950
You can't do this!

1475
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:13,817
It's not right!

1476
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:17,174
It's not!

1477
01:25:17,663 --> 01:25:20,550
You want
to go say good-bye?

1478
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,979
Yeah.

1479
01:25:21,979 --> 01:25:23,897
Ok. I'll wait here.

1480
01:25:29,181 --> 01:25:30,629
Maggie.

1481
01:25:35,895 --> 01:25:37,813
I heard
you were leaving.

1482
01:25:37,822 --> 01:25:40,709
I refused to apologize
to Dean Howard,

1483
01:25:40,699 --> 01:25:42,617
so I have no choice.

1484
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:44,056
I'm sorry
to hear that.

1485
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:47,413
Say good-bye
to boots for me.

1486
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:49,350
I will.

1487
01:25:51,258 --> 01:25:53,656
Take good care of him.

1488
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:56,054
I promise.

1489
01:25:58,461 --> 01:26:01,827
Take care
of yourself, Dee.

1490
01:26:01,817 --> 01:26:04,695
I'll never
forget you, Maggie.

1491
01:26:07,102 --> 01:26:09,029
I swear
I never will.

1492
01:26:13,815 --> 01:26:15,254
Bye.

1493
01:26:33,389 --> 01:26:34,837
Well...

1494
01:26:43,469 --> 01:26:46,346
Well, I'll be
seeing you.

1495
01:26:47,784 --> 01:26:49,223
Hoyt.

1496
01:27:04,462 --> 01:27:07,349
You pull out
all the stops, Maggie.

1497
01:27:08,778 --> 01:27:10,696
