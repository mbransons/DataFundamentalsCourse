1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,838
The Canadian Northwest.

3
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,962
Here the first traders
from the Old World

4
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,324
intermarried with the lndians
of the plains and forests

5
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:10,004
to found a new race:
the Metis of Canada.

6
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:14,442
Here, for two centuries these
half-breed hunters and trappers

7
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:18,641
multiplied and prospered
a law unto themselves.

8
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,200
Then surveyors and homebuilders
pushed westward

9
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,357
bringing laws of land
and property

10
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,723
which threatened to end forever

11
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,641
the free ways of the wild trails.

12
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:36,162
ln 1885, resentful and confused,
the half-breeds,

13
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:40,639
under the leadership of Louis Riel,
revolted against the advance

14
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,041
of unwelcome law.

15
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:46,080
ln that hour, a handful
of hard riding men

16
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,637
in scarlet coats,
the Northwest Mounted Police,

17
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,883
stood between Canada's destiny

18
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:56,366
and the rebellion that was being
kindled across the American border

19
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,206
in a little Montana school house.

20
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:02,041
Three cheers for
the red, white and blue.

21
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:06,042
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

22
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:10,276
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

23
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:14,555
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.

24
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:18,641
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

25
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:23,042
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

26
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:27,121
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

27
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:31,321
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.

28
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:35,321
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

29
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:39,605
Susie, you didn't sing
the last words.

30
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:41,884
l got scared, Mr. Riel.

31
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:45,198
He kind of looks like the big
bad robber in the picture books.

32
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,516
l'm going to let you all
go home early today children.

33
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:52,282
- School dismissed!
- Bye, Mr. Riel!

34
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:54,125
Susie! Come here.

35
00:03:56,647 --> 00:04:00,879
There's nothing to frighten you.
These are old friends from Canada.

36
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,277
Get the kid out!
Time is short.

37
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:08,715
-Run along. Don't imagine things.
-Alright. l'll sing good tomorrow.

38
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,603
You're not gonna be here tomorrow.

39
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:20,560
l got your message, Duroc.
Returning to Canada is death.

40
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,963
For some maybe, not for us.

41
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:25,801
15 years of exile
haven't changed you Corbeau.

42
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,078
Or you... l hope.

43
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:36,760
Canada change plenty. No more
she belong to the half-breed.

44
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:40,723
The law come on the old trails,
white people steal the land,

45
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,357
the surveyor tell us
where we got to live.

46
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:47,235
We send plenty letter to government.
She is too busy to listen.

47
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,718
Government take care of lndians,
take care of white settler.

48
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,396
Ain't nobody take care
of the half-breed people.

49
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,967
No half-breed gonna take
care of himself.

50
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:02,805
She's gonna fight by Jove.
You gotta come back, and lead us.

51
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,483
-Against the Queen's soldiers?
-Yes.

52
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:08,002
-We tried that once.
-This time it will be different.

53
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,686
The lndians are in grand council.

54
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,680
More Black Feet and Cree
than anybody ever saw before.

55
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:15,084
They'll join us if l say so,
and fight.

56
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:18,160
l got Cree blood,
same as Big Bear.

57
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,400
-The lndian government...
-What? You and me,

58
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:25,879
and Duroc, we will be the government.
With the lndians,

59
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,158
we'll wipe the whites out
of Western Canada.

60
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,956
We'll set up a new government.
Batoche gonna be our capital.

61
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:36,718
Half-breeds coming there by hundreds
from the river and woods,...

62
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:40,477
-They still believe in me...
-Yeah.

63
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,079
You know what happens
if we fail again?

64
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:50,116
We don't fail!

65
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:54,483
Corbeau's got something.
You've never seen a gun like that.

66
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:57,201
She squirt lead like a hurricane.

67
00:05:57,927 --> 00:06:00,441
Trust Corbeau to know
the newest way of killing.

68
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:03,798
-My gun shoots 1000 slugs a minute.
-lmpossible.

69
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,646
A Gatling gun stole near
the border.

70
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,440
-Blood.
-Put on the dunce cap.

71
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:12,326
-l go fight alone. Come on!
-No!

72
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,198
l will never let you lead my people.

73
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,676
You can be the saint
that leads them Louis.

74
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,840
All l want is the whiskey business.
And l'll get it.

75
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,965
Or you'll get no help
from the lndians.

76
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:23,606
l don't want no help
from a whiskey trader.

77
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,718
-You...!
-Corbeau!

78
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,165
Louis, if he don't get
the Cree and Black Feet

79
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:37,200
to fight those redcoats with us,
we go smash.

80
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,403
And the half-breeds,
they don't fight without Louis.

81
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:42,560
So maybe you don't like each other

82
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,684
but you need each other very much.

83
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,516
Blood will run like water.

84
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:57,157
Blood? You won't notice it much.
The mounted police wear red coats.

85
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,637
Looks like bargain day
in Batoche.

86
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:28,756
Trouble... Keep your eyes open
and holster closed.

87
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:36,916
Left turn!
Present arms!

88
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:41,000
Present the arms!

89
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:46,125
Soldier, what for
you don't do what l say?

90
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:47,796
l go home.

91
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:51,477
Duroc, he's a go home.

92
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,080
Hey! Why you go home?

93
00:07:55,407 --> 00:08:00,197
''Shoulder arm, hold arm,
right, left, right about,...''

94
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:04,640
He change his mind too much.
l go home.

95
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,718
Go home? Get back.

96
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:11,085
All you men obey the order.

97
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,440
-Come here!
-Red coats!

98
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:19,757
Johnny Pelang, dismiss the men.
Get the paper.

99
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,437
-Good boy.
-Shoulder the arms!

100
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:28,645
Redcoats coming, we dismiss now.
Go away, but don't leave.

101
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:45,243
You suppose the inspector's right
and Riel is back?

102
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:46,965
The inspector's always right.

103
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,639
-The fort's 20 miles away.
-Dry up.

104
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:01,924
-Where did they get those revolvers?
-Santa Claus.

105
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,916
The police.
Cover up quick.

106
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:13,160
Hello, Freddie Monts.

107
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,559
Pretty heavy lunch box
you got there.

108
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,601
She's just a little present
for my wife.

109
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,924
Be careful she's not your widow.

110
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,200
-Brave man to give his wife bullets.
-Stow that.

111
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:36,125
There are men here all the way
from the Parsnip. They mean business.

112
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,723
Fort Carlton tonight,
same place.

113
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:10,796
Ronnie.

114
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,996
l told you to forget that klootch.
She's poison.

115
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:19,084
-But Jim l...
-Never trust a blue eyed squaw.

116
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:35,399
There's the old wolf himself.

117
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,799
Go to hospital and call on
your sister. Stay there until l come.

118
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:40,924
-Don't come on a stretcher.
-Sharp now.

119
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:53,884
-Hello, Jim.
-Hello, Dan. Quite a crowd.

120
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,997
Sure. Plenty friends of mine.

121
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:06,200
-ls Louis Riel here yet?
-He is the best friend we got.

122
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,923
Better advise him to go slow.

123
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:13,236
For 15 years we go slow.
Now we go quick.

124
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:16,045
We give you 24 hours.

125
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,962
On this paper we write what we want.

126
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,635
lf your government say no,
we make new government.

127
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,240
You're making a mistake.

128
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:32,041
-The law is in the Northwest now.
-So is this fellow.

129
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:37,122
You can't fight the whole
British empire?

130
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:43,480
50 mounted police, only 50.
ln all Canada, only 500.

131
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,043
We got many thousand half-breed.

132
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:49,441
Big Bear and Crow foot
got 10,000 warrior.

133
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,638
The lndians won't follow Riel.

134
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,998
Maybe they follow Jacques Corbeau.

135
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:59,964
lf you bring back that killer
you'll deserve what you get.

136
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,880
You're a great old wolf, Duroc.

137
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,239
l'd hate to see you
hang with that coyote.

138
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:07,524
-24 hour Jim, we want answer.
-You'll get it,

139
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:09,445
if the wires to Ottawa stay up.

140
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:14,205
The wires, she'll stay up.
Just 24 hours.

141
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:18,682
Don't get them tangled
around your neck.

142
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:22,677
-You think Corbeau no come, eh?
-He will if he smells blood.

143
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:24,684
Maybe he smell blood
pretty quick.

144
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:27,401
Your blood!

145
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:29,836
Pull him down!
We're gonna fight!

146
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:32,925
lf we want Corbeau,
we'll be getting Corbeau.

147
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:38,320
The redcoat be skinned
pretty easy.

148
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:41,042
lf we want Riel,
we'll get Riel!

149
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,720
-Didn't Jim ask you to stay here?
-Yes but...

150
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:48,361
Take your hand off that bridle!

151
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:54,680
Stand clear.
Let go of that bridle!

152
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:07,125
Shorty! lt's a boy!
A boy Shorty!

153
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,959
Don't you want to see your son?

154
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,357
A boy! Hang loose!

155
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:13,876
Out of the way!
My son he ask for see me.

156
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:16,083
Good for him!

157
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,877
Tod McDuff!
l just have baby!

158
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,076
Remarkable.

159
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:29,402
-Hello, Tod.
-Hey, Jim.

160
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:31,955
Thanks for keeping Shorty covered,
but l'm glad you didn't shoot.

161
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:35,836
l was of a mind too
but l was afraid l'd drop a stitch.

162
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:43,402
She not very big.
How you make sure that's boy?

163
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:49,681
Black Chief.
That's chief.

164
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,800
Look, Jim.
l just got baby boy!

165
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:54,926
That's a fine papoose.

166
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,957
l've got to tell my wife
about this.

167
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,241
-Hello, April.
-Hi.

168
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,524
l'll have to get Shorty's baby
a rattle for that timing.

169
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,722
The baby arrived hours ago.

170
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,282
-Then you get the rattle.
-You rattle me enough as it is.

171
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:16,245
Hold still Niska.
Roll up my sleeve Ekawe.

172
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:17,356
l will.

173
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,001
How can you deliver a baby,
set a broken leg and look

174
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,123
lovelier than a Christmas
calendar all at once?

175
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:26,637
You're quite a picture yourself,
you'd look good in a golf frame.

176
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:30,403
-Better in the same frame.
-Let's make it a family album.

177
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:32,717
Let's water the horses. We must
get Duroc's message on the wire.

178
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:33,836
Right.

179
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,721
When you look at Ronnie even
his hair stands to attention.

180
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,565
There's a contrary streak
in the Logan breed.

181
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:43,804
-We just know our own minds.
-You don't know your own heart?

182
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:47,366
-l don't intent to listen to it.
-You will.

183
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:53,157
You're leg will be just as straight
as sergeant Bret's back.

184
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:54,920
-Tell you what our plans are...
-Jim!

185
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,079
l've been transferred to
Nova Scotia.

186
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,515
Nova Scotia?

187
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,641
What's that's where
codfish grow, isn't it?

188
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,957
Orders are orders
in my branch of the service too.

189
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:12,597
Niska! You mustn't eat that.
Your tummy will turn to stone.

190
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,206
Like your heart.

191
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:20,121
-l just don't understand.
-You'll never understand Jim.

192
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:23,804
Until something
beats you to your knees.

193
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:27,238
Don't get yourself
all over plastered.

194
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,325
-You love me.
-You see?

195
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:31,324
You don't ask.
You just make statements.

196
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,398
Well, do you love me?

197
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,116
l might but l don't want to.

198
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,800
Help me, will you?

199
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,642
You're fine and right for yourself
and for the service but

200
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,963
-anyway, l'm leaving.
-Running away?

201
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:52,558
-l'm no heroine.
-All Anglican nurses are heroines.

202
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,526
l don't want to be bravely
smiling goodbye to my husband

203
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:58,167
every time he puts down
a rebellion or

204
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:02,200
goes on patrol to the North Pole.
l just wouldn't let him.

205
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:04,675
When do you leave?

206
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,597
-Next month.
-We'll see.

207
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:12,844
Anything in the regulations about
you always getting your woman?

208
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:14,759
No, but there should be.

209
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,876
l gave the horses some water.

210
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:26,762
Have some yourself.
l'll be there in a minute.

211
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:31,556
l wish you'd think what it
means to us if you leave.

212
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:34,123
l'll have plenty of time
to think in Nova Scotia.

213
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:37,117
Sure. What's time to a codfish?

214
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:42,276
But l'll track you.
To Nova Scotia, Afghanistan...

215
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:45,956
or anywhere, because l still
think we belong in the same frame.

216
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:55,120
Niska, do you think l'm a fool?

217
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:58,996
So do l.

218
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:02,636
You'll make somebody
a good wife someday.

219
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,402
ln the meantime we'll need you
as a Mounted Police scout.

220
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,083
Duroc is my very good friend.

221
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:11,882
Nearly every night for 30 years
we've played pinnacle together.

222
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:13,760
You can't be on both sides.

223
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:17,757
McDuff, you don't scout
for the Redcoats?

224
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:23,960
-You don't turn against me.
-My father was a Highlander.

225
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,798
They helped knit the Empire together
and l'll have no hand in

226
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,685
unraveling it.

227
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,119
The inspector will swear you in
at Fort Carlton in the morning Tod.

228
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,045
24 hours Jim.

229
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:43,364
You and me,
like brothers Tod.

230
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:48,437
Aye, that we are.
But l cannot fight against the Queen.

231
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,485
Flesh of the snake.
Blood of the skunk!

232
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:10,844
You don't fight with us,
maybe you don't fight with nobody.

233
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:14,115
lt would twist my soul
to fight against you Dan.

234
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,522
But l cannot fight
against the Queen.

235
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:50,276
-Jerry.
-Yes?

236
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,442
Cover up for me after mess.
l've gotta get out.

237
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:57,125
Next time tell that klootch
to bring a friend.

238
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:01,166
Ottawa can't possibly act
on these demands in 24 hours.

239
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,282
B0 atoche will boil over
and scald half of Canada.

240
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,116
Rotten business.

241
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,843
lf the lndians rise they'll be
blood from here to Baffin Bay.

242
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,964
Come on!
Gates closing for the night!

243
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,079
Everybody out.
Civilians outside the stockade!

244
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:21,564
Get going, Uncle Blue Owl.

245
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:26,124
-Come on. Come on.
-Hurry it up there.

246
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,279
Hurry it up.

247
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,925
-Where can l find the head man?
-Headquarters over there.

248
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,443
Keep moving. Everyone out.

249
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,036
Hey you!

250
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:54,200
Who's that? Gabriel?

251
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,003
No civilians allowed in
the stockade after retreat, mister.

252
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:00,806
-You'll have to come back tomorrow.
-Thanks.

253
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:05,835
Hold him for me, will you soldier?
He's part bull and don't like red.

254
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,279
A man from Texas, sir.

255
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,802
My name's Dusty Rivers sir,
Texas Rangers.

256
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:26,285
l landed up here following
a man we're after for murder.

257
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,523
Orderly, tell sergeant Bret
l want him.

258
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:29,796
Yes, sir.

259
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:31,761
Ranger's commission.

260
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:36,483
Commissioner's deputy,
United States Marshal

261
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:40,280
and here's my O. K.
from your Regina office.

262
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:46,921
-l've heard of your organization.
-Thanks. We heard of yours too.

263
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,756
Thank you.

264
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:51,765
You come at rather a difficult time.

265
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:55,837
Sergeant Bret, this is Mr. Rivers
of the Texas Rangers.

266
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:56,996
Howdy.

267
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:58,960
Texas did you say?

268
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:01,118
-Texas, is a United State.
-Yes, sir.

269
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:04,484
The Rangers are a organization
rather like our own

270
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:06,686
in some respects.

271
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:11,116
Yes, sir.

272
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:12,886
He's here on a police errand.

273
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:16,039
See that he's fed, billeted,
and offered a bath.

274
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:18,684
Then help him fill out
the proper forms.

275
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:20,636
Very good, sir.

276
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,325
That's mighty hospitable of you
but l want to get started...

277
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:25,516
This way please.

278
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,720
They say Riel
is gonna try it again.

279
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:33,956
Look out, l'm not Riel.

280
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:36,647
l tried a lot of times
l never got anywhere.

281
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,239
-Low bridge there Slim.
-Place wasn't built for a giraffe.

282
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:51,596
Gentlemen!

283
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,682
This is Mr. Rivers of
the Texas constabulary.

284
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,083
-Rangers.
-Hello, constable!

285
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:01,045
Another criminal has leaked out
of the US and he's after him.

286
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,763
You can sleep in that
collapsible mantrap, sheriff.

287
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,040
Attention, to roll call.

288
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,595
-Constable Ackroyd.
-Here.

289
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:12,080
-Adams.
-Cameron.

290
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,959
-Douglass.
-Fyffe.

291
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:15,760
-Herrick.
-Judson.

292
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,286
-Kent.
-Kennedy.

293
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:19,921
-On patrol.
-Harder than rock but for your head.

294
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,560
-Lane.
-Logan.

295
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:24,596
Logan?

296
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:27,321
He was slightly overheated
and went out to get some air.

297
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:37,276
Ronnie!

298
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:44,396
-Why you be so late?
-l was put on potato patrol.

299
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:48,118
lf this potato is other woman...

300
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,080
l eat your heart out.

301
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,760
l was pealing one million potatoes

302
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:55,963
just because l talked
to you in Batoche.

303
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,996
Then maybe l don't eat your heart.

304
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:02,404
l just keep him here,
inside my heart.

305
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,841
Suits me molasses.

306
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:08,924
-Here. Want this for a padlock?
-Ronnie!

307
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:15,841
This lock both our hearts together.

308
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:19,246
Put it on for me please.

309
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:25,516
What's that?

310
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:37,556
Get!

311
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,883
lf that wicked sentry finds you

312
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:56,998
your cute little pelt
will be nailed to the barn door.

313
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,999
Ronnie, maybe police
no let me come Fort no more.

314
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:07,000
-Why?
-My father, he come back.

315
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:09,361
Who's your father?

316
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:12,246
He's very bad medicine.

317
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,517
l remember long ago
he cooked bear meat on stick

318
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:18,599
give me piece in my hand.

319
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,046
Well l'll tell you
what we'll do.

320
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:25,643
l won't bite him
if he doesn't bite me.

321
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:29,796
Please,

322
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:32,963
you don't let my father
bust us up!

323
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:39,882
Listen you little wild cat.
You're the only real thing for me.

324
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:45,276
Nobody, nothing could ever
make me let you go.

325
00:24:46,487 --> 00:24:50,685
l love you so terrible bad
l feel good.

326
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:55,805
l'll be pealing potatoes
the rest of my life for this.

327
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:59,116
-Douglass, a hand will you?
-Of course.

328
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,676
Mother and child,
both doing nicely.

329
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,439
What do you ride in Texas?
Elephants?

330
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:06,675
They come in handy if you
break a wheel on your wagon.

331
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:08,965
An uncle of mine visited Texas once.

332
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:11,083
Sir William Wade,
perhaps you've met him.

333
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,117
We hung a fellow
named Bill Wade.

334
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,086
That probably was not Sir William.

335
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:17,236
No!

336
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:20,284
Advise me what time Logan get in.

337
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:22,557
Good night Sheriff.
Revelly is at six o'clock.

338
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:26,399
-Re- what?
-Oh Revelly.

339
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:29,765
You fellows are pretty fancy!

340
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:32,886
Having ltalian food for breakfast.

341
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,517
Doesn't your organization
rise by bugle call?

342
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:40,719
Sure! We blow Rev...
Oh! You mean Revelry.

343
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:44,401
lt's been waking him up every
morning and he can't pronounce it.

344
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:47,724
Any more than you can eat it.
We'll get your man for you.

345
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:50,801
l was counting on being
home by the 4th of July.

346
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:56,326
-Your birthday?
-No, my Uncle Sam's.

347
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:57,926
lt's an American holiday.

348
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,840
Yeah. The States sort of set up
housekeeping for themselves.

349
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:03,760
After being hatched
and protected for 150 years.

350
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:07,039
-Don't mind him. He reads a lot.
-We stuck to our mother, that's all.

351
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:09,284
lt's a wise child that
knows its own mother.

352
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:13,360
A wiser one that appreciates her.
Good night Sheriff.

353
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:16,436
Good night.

354
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:21,406
But l still want to be home
by the 4th of July.

355
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,798
Have your saddles ready for
marching orders in the morning.

356
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:25,361
There may be action.

357
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,922
-Lights out. Good night.
-Good night.

358
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,799
Action tomorrow. You hear that?

359
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,356
Look, he's a Redcoat at heart.

360
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:35,324
ls that the Rangers full dress?

361
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:37,405
Undress.

362
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,876
Very good!

363
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:42,204
Why do you carry two guns?

364
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,603
One don't shoot far enough.

365
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:49,356
-l'd like to visit Texas some day.
-You can.

366
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:52,680
Canadians get over to our
country too once in a while.

367
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:55,759
l'm after one of 'em now.

368
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:59,758
-Good night.
-Good night.

369
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:01,396
Good night.

370
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:11,486
That second red river cart
looks like it had the mumps.

371
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:32,925
Wait. l'll talk to them.

372
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:37,764
-Good afternoon.
-How do you do?

373
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,561
What's in the carts?

374
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:45,636
-Take a look. lf you want.
-No, you have no warrant.

375
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,044
These aren't ordinary times, mister.

376
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:55,997
Rare wheels for a red river cart.

377
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:59,604
Open it up! Come along!
Pull the hide off.

378
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:05,159
Holy cat! Look at this!

379
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:18,039
Why did you do that?
We could have taken them prisoner.

380
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,797
There was no need to shed blood.

381
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:23,317
You're splattered with it too, Louis.

382
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,438
You can't back out now.

383
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,637
Get going!
Advance!

384
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:35,440
Get up there! Come on!

385
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,599
-Well?
-No word yet sir.

386
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:56,403
Fur!
Buy from me please.

387
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,277
-You buy these white ermines?
-No!

388
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:01,841
Buy from me please.

389
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:05,443
Furs. You buy these
pretty white ermines?

390
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,885
What l got here is
very fine, very young.

391
00:29:10,607 --> 00:29:12,837
What you got is the oldest
thing there is,

392
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:15,919
only the original sale
was for an apple not a fur.

393
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:18,558
l no sell this for apple.

394
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:24,117
Stranger! l wouldn't buy
any furs from that Beelzebub!

395
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:26,523
-She steals them!
-You tell lie!

396
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:30,000
Somagun Scotch lndian!

397
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:33,725
-l think l kill you.
-Heathen.

398
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:36,361
l'll take you across my knee
and tan your hide.

399
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:38,802
-l kill you!
-Oh you would!

400
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:46,322
Let go my hair! Let go!

401
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:47,995
l'll get you for this!

402
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:57,324
-l'll skin you for this!
-You're gonna get it!

403
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:58,716
Let me go!

404
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,756
Take her hands off her
or l'll beat your teeth out!

405
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:06,116
Logan!

406
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:12,004
Tod, report to the OC.
He'll swear you in.

407
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:14,766
Aye Him. Daughter of Beelzabub,
l know how to handle a woman.

408
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:18,641
l told you to keep away
from this fort.

409
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:23,161
Pretty soon
you'll no be boss no more.

410
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,436
Get out of here!

411
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:27,758
Wait a minute!
Where did you get that ring?

412
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,115
What you care?

413
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:36,486
Logan, l want to talk to you.

414
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,004
l warned you about that klootch.

415
00:30:43,247 --> 00:30:46,922
-My personal business is my own.
-She's a thieving little...

416
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:48,685
l ought to wipe your jaw for that.

417
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:50,276
Don't be a fool.

418
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:54,997
-lt's because she's part lndian.
-No! Because she's all bad.

419
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,317
You'd lose your eyebrows
if l married her, wouldn't you?

420
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,404
-Why?
-Why not?

421
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,243
-l don't see why all this...
-Do you know who she is?

422
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:07,680
-l know who she's going to be.
-She's Jacques Corbeau's daughter.

423
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:09,963
Look out!

424
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:16,956
lt's April!

425
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:21,675
What happened?

426
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,521
Call the hospital orderlies.

427
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,000
Get the doctor!
Put that man out there.

428
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:27,118
Take this one first.
He's dead.

429
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:30,120
-Corporal take charge of the body.
-Dr. Roberts. This way sir!

430
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,602
-There's two of them in there.
-Gently, he's badly hurt.

431
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:35,000
-Who is it?
-l don't know!

432
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,324
Corporal!
Clear these people.

433
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:47,518
-Come on!
-Let Miss Logan through!

434
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:49,120
How'd it happen?

435
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:52,646
Constable Fenton.

436
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:54,999
-Where did you find him?
-On the Red Berry trail.

437
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,566
l was on my way to a case.

438
00:31:56,807 --> 00:32:01,517
How long were they lying
there before you found them?

439
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:04,402
-lt happened just before l got there.
-Did you hear firing?

440
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:09,124
-Did you see any tracks?
-Some red river cart tracks.

441
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,760
l couldn't tell how many horses.

442
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:14,157
-What Fenton able to say anything?
-He said something about a gun but...

443
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:16,005
Constable Fenton, what happened?

444
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,399
Wagon train, sir...

445
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:22,796
Carrying a...

446
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:24,836
Gatling gun.

447
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:28,998
-A Gatling gun?
-Somebody running guns to Duroc.

448
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:32,126
-Did you recognize the men?
-No, sir.

449
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:37,286
But funny foreign looking saddle.

450
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:39,406
Fenton,

451
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:42,078
can you describe the saddle?

452
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,877
Did it have a big silver horn?

453
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:47,236
Biggest

454
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,125
l ever saw.

455
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,726
What the boy saw was
a Mexican charro saddle.

456
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:57,046
Probably ridden by the man
l'm after, Jacques Corbeau.

457
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:58,876
Corbeau?

458
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:01,765
Have the bugle sound
boots and saddles.

459
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:03,764
-Patrol of 20 men.
-Yes, sir.

460
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:07,521
Good job Miss Logan.
Better stay at the fort.

461
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:08,922
Batoche is not safe.

462
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,237
Thank you but l have several
patients in my hospital.

463
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,046
l wish l was one of them...

464
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,119
-Boots and saddles!
-Come on!

465
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:38,555
No member of the force shall discuss
the situation with any civilian,

466
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,245
except in being in the
regular line of duty.

467
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:42,796
Alright. Bedrolls and kit bags
on the wagons at once!

468
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,560
Don't let the grass grow under you.
Come on!

469
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:48,999
On the double.
Get 'em out there.

470
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:53,405
Pick 'em up. They won't bite.

471
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,444
Be sure you put that
on the horse Logan.

472
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:58,880
-One keg of horseshoes.
-Right.

473
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:01,237
Don't forget the nails this time.
You can't sew them on.

474
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:02,766
-Right.
-And an extra wagon pole.

475
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:04,798
-That breaks you'll pull it yourself.
-Right.

476
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:06,839
One coil of rope.

477
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:21,077
You boys can sure slap
a saddle on pronto.

478
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,437
Come on!
On the double!

479
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,318
Fresh team for you Miss.
lnspector's orders.

480
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,126
-Thanks. l can hitch them.
-lf you say so ma'am.

481
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:42,356
Fall in!

482
00:34:49,327 --> 00:34:52,125
-l'll hook 'em up for you Miss.
-Thank you.

483
00:34:57,447 --> 00:34:59,278
Back up here you lucky horse.

484
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:02,200
lt belongs to the Mounted Police.

485
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:08,719
-They're pretty good, aren't they?
-They're the best.

486
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:15,002
-My name's Dusty Rivers.
-lsn't that a contradiction?

487
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:19,959
l expect you've never
been to Texas, Miss...

488
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:22,005
-Miss...?
-April Logan.

489
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:27,120
-April? You're not fooling?
-No.

490
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:28,606
Here's your horse, sergeant.

491
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,763
Head 'em out.

492
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:34,806
Group mount!

493
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:43,563
Reform ranks!

494
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:49,276
Eyes right!

495
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:54,322
Eyes front!

496
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,436
At ease!

497
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:58,400
Make much of your horses!

498
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:02,844
April, l'd rather you didn't
go back to the town.

499
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:04,998
Sergeant, what part of
the parade do l ride in?

500
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,680
l'm sorry,
you're not going with us.

501
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:09,957
-April, with Riel on the warpath.
-l'm sorry too,

502
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:13,238
-but l am going with you.
-Corbeau is wanted for murder here.

503
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,040
He belongs
to the Mounted Police now.

504
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,037
He belongs to whoever
catches him first.

505
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:21,679
Hi, sis'!
Let your brother kiss you goodbye.

506
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:23,121
ln the line Logan.

507
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:28,321
l'll be glad to tend to any
unfinished chores for you.

508
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,637
There are some things about
you that l don't like.

509
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:33,321
-You're not exactly perfection.
-This isn't Texas...

510
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:37,645
Jim! l think l'm capable of deciding
who l'll kiss goodbye.

511
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:40,086
l'm not sure that you are.

512
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:48,800
-You ought to obey him.
-Do you?

513
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:53,723
-Not always.
-Your judgment's good enough for me.

514
00:36:57,167 --> 00:37:00,239
-Patrol all present, sergeant.
-Very good.

515
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:07,159
-Patrol ready to march, sir.
-Pick up the trail at the scene.

516
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:09,125
lt'll probably take you
to Big Bear's camp.

517
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:11,602
-Yes sir. March them off.
-Very good sir.

518
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:13,486
March!
March!

519
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:16,599
Sections right!
Right!

520
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,245
Wire from Headquarters, sir.

521
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,035
Sergeant Bret!

522
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:25,476
Patrol halt!

523
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:32,000
-Dismiss you men, sergeant.
-Beg your pardon, sir?

524
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,198
-Dismiss your men.
-Very good, sir.

525
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:39,244
-Sergeant Field, take over!
-What the..

526
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:40,476
Dismiss the patrol.

527
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:43,560
Sections left about!

528
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:46,958
-What's up?
-We're staying here.

529
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:49,807
Not me, amigo.
l'm gonna get Corbeau.

530
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:53,001
lf you ride through that gate
l'll place you under arrest.

531
00:37:54,207 --> 00:37:56,243
-You can try.
-Sergeant!

532
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:59,884
lnspector's complements: Will you,
Mr. Rivers and McDuff report at once.

533
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,286
Change of orders from Regina.

534
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:12,041
No patrols to leave until we're
reinforced by Colonel lrvine.

535
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:16,400
lt'll take a week. By then Corbeau
will have Big Bear on the warpath.

536
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,516
And the Black feet.

537
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:19,165
-Couldn't you wire Regina?
-No!

538
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:22,439
The wires were cut two minutes
after this came through.

539
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:25,437
Does the order prohibit
sending out a single scout?

540
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:28,356
No.

541
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,405
l'd like your permission to proceed
to Big Bear's camp alone

542
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:36,317
-and try to keep him loyal.
-No! Only a loon would do it.

543
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:40,877
lt's a ticklish job,
but permission is granted.

544
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:42,681
l'll leave at once, sir.

545
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:44,326
l'll leave at the same time.

546
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:52,440
l'd be grateful if you'd
bind and gag this Texan.

547
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:56,323
-l'm not going where he is.
-Where do you want to go?

548
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:59,077
l figured to pick up Corbeau
in Batoche.

549
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,959
-Why do you think he's there?
-That's Riel's capital, isn't it?

550
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,317
You can't make an arrest in Canada.

551
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:10,242
lf l got to have a nurse...
give me the Scotchman.

552
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:13,276
McDuff, you'll
accompany Mr. Rivers.

553
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:17,841
And gentlemen
l hope you keep your scalps.

554
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:23,477
A nurse, at my time of life...

555
00:39:25,247 --> 00:39:26,646
-Good hunting.
-Thanks.

556
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,198
-Sure you make that fast.
-Alright miss.

557
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:33,926
Climb aboard McDuff.

558
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,205
-Where are you going?
-Batoche.

559
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:42,675
-l wish it was 1000 miles.
-Seat's too hard for 20 miles.

560
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:46,079
Lady, to me it's just
like sitting on a cloud.

561
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:48,356
Get!

562
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:57,881
-Are you riding with us Jim?
-No. The other way.

563
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:00,121
l'll send you a postcard.

564
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:41,005
Canada is a lot different
from what l expected.

565
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:42,116
The scenery?

566
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:46,360
-No, the people.
-Haven't had much time to tell.

567
00:40:47,007 --> 00:40:49,043
Sometimes it strikes you
at first sight...

568
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:51,926
l mean...

569
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:56,361
You can usually figure a man
by the way he handles his horse

570
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:58,166
but women are different.

571
00:40:58,407 --> 00:41:00,967
What did you expect
Canadian women to be like?

572
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:06,078
Like the scenery: good to look
at but kind of frostbitten.

573
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,599
But you're not.

574
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:12,961
l've always understood Americans

575
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:15,920
were too busy building,
and selling and shooting each other

576
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:17,998
to waste time saying
nice things to women.

577
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:22,763
-We get around to it now and then.
-Must be appreciated by your wife.

578
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,478
-Who's wife?
-Aren't you married?

579
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:29,276
l've always held that
a bachelor is a fellow who

580
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,198
never makes
the same mistake once.

581
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:33,236
You believe that?

582
00:41:33,687 --> 00:41:36,440
l did... until mighty recent.

583
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:46,644
Do you think a plant from up here
would do alright in Texas?

584
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:49,126
l don't know Texas.

585
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:53,524
Even the moonlight's warm and soft
along the Pecos River.

586
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:58,235
Do you have fast horses
in Texas Mr. Rivers?

587
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:00,366
The fastest in the world.

588
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:03,203
Betting they cannot
keep up with the men?

589
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:10,036
Look!

590
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:21,526
-What happened, Mrs. Burns?
-Don't go into Batoche.

591
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:24,002
-They've looted the Trading Post.
-And driven us from our homes.

592
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,846
-How could Duroc permit it?
-He tried to keep order but...

593
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:28,446
when Corbeau got there...

594
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:29,876
-Corbeau?
-Yes.

595
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,796
Excuse me, lady.

596
00:42:37,047 --> 00:42:40,084
Enough!
Just one thing more.

597
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,997
Riel can tell you how this
new government sets up.

598
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:46,358
But l'll tell you how
it's going to win.

599
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:49,435
10,000 lndians turn loose
on Saskatchewan.

600
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:53,276
They'll be nobody left to pull
down this government

601
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:54,516
when l'm finished.

602
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:03,397
Canadian woman
who has so sweet the eyes,

603
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:07,720
who has so sweet the eyes,
who has so sweet the eyes,

604
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:11,721
who has so sweet the eyes,
who has so sweet the eyes,

605
00:43:12,887 --> 00:43:13,876
Gentlemen,

606
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:17,959
Corbeau has promised you
the backing of Big Bear.

607
00:43:18,927 --> 00:43:22,158
When Big Bear leads
the Cree nation upon the war path

608
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,758
the Black Feet will rise with him.

609
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:30,556
Our fire of wrath will
consume its oppressors.

610
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:38,038
From it will arise,
not half-breed,

611
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:41,404
but a free and
independent Metis nation.

612
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:47,399
Don't mind me, mister.
Go right ahead.

613
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:50,241
Duroc, who is he?

614
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:52,717
He's officer from United States.

615
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,958
Want talk with Canada Government.

616
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:57,320
l bring him here.

617
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:04,958
They found out quick.

618
00:44:09,287 --> 00:44:10,276
Hey!

619
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,796
l'm a Deputy US Marshal, Mr. Riel

620
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:17,400
-And...
-You know my name.

621
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:21,318
Sure! Who don't?
Here's my credentials.

622
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:26,286
We'd be happy to know
if your new government

623
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:29,240
means to work hand in hand
with the United States.

624
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:33,522
The Metis of Canada will be happy
to cooperate with the USA.

625
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:37,243
Suppose some fellow commits
a crime in our country

626
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:39,079
then trails up here to hide out.

627
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:43,801
We'll help you in every way
just as we hope you will help us.

628
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:45,606
That's fine because

629
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:49,639
l got a warrant here for the arrest
of a man named Jacques Corbeau.

630
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:53,841
On a charge of murder.

631
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:01,836
Gentlemen!

632
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:04,961
Council is recessed.

633
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,156
Wait here.

634
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:17,281
That put a bee in Riel's bonnet.

635
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:23,166
-This bee on your bonnet.
-What's the matter with it?

636
00:45:23,727 --> 00:45:28,084
-My first bullet shoots him off.
-Why you wanna ruin my bonnet?

637
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:31,799
Just so you know it is me
who fires the second shot.

638
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,403
The one that go between your eye.

639
00:45:34,887 --> 00:45:38,516
l'll make you a small wager.
50 cents

640
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,642
that l put a bullet through
your vengeful heart

641
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,043
before you shoot the knob
from my bonnet.

642
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:47,677
l take that bet and l take
the money from your pocket

643
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:50,518
because you'll be dead.

644
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:53,958
Corbeau.

645
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:58,762
-There's a US officer here.
-For what?

646
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,959
-You.
-Well?

647
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:03,957
He wants a warrant from
my government for your arrest.

648
00:46:04,249 --> 00:46:07,958
-Why don't you give it to him?
-But we need you for the lndians.

649
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:12,878
ln two hours give him your warrant.
Tell him l'm in Big Bear's camp.

650
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:14,238
He can arrest me there.

651
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:16,485
He would never leave
that camp alive.

652
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:20,119
You don't want him killed here,
do you Louis?

653
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:24,163
At an lndian camp,
who cares?

654
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:36,963
Once the Cree warriors
were free men.

655
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:40,566
Canada belonged to you and to us.

656
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:42,887
Well it's gonna be ours again.

657
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:45,524
Take the warpath with us.
Fight!

658
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:50,761
Fight like you used to fight,
and not one of these prairie cops

659
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:52,487
will be buried with his scalp on.

660
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:59,199
Big Bear, that medal
you wear is the Queen's.

661
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:03,160
The great white mother who sent
food to you when you starved.

662
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:06,129
You're too wise to let a liar
make bad blood between us.

663
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:10,447
Men say Queen no longer rule us.

664
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:13,005
Redcoat no more our friend.

665
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:16,884
This is our friend that bites
with a thousand teeth of fire.

666
00:47:20,729 --> 00:47:24,768
Make gun talk to them.

667
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:28,759
-lt'll tear it to rags.
-Squaw make new lodge.

668
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:31,005
A hole in the tent won't
change the British Empire.

669
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:35,327
This man is going to hang.
l don't want to see you beside him.

670
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:39,488
Make gun talk.

671
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:49,481
Two more strangers.

672
00:47:49,889 --> 00:47:52,084
l want his scalp.

673
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:02,682
l know him.

674
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:07,804
Well you sure found
Corbeau alright.

675
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:09,688
You're as welcome as a broken leg.

676
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:14,168
Ahkakito, who these men?

677
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:16,206
Spies to count your men and horses.

678
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:18,644
His tongue is forked.
He said he came alone.

679
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:20,322
This man is no spy.

680
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:24,601
He comes from afar to take
Corbeau who killed in his nation.

681
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:28,120
Like Mounted Police want
Corbeau because he has killed here.

682
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:33,004
Are you afraid of Redcoats?
Their blood spills like other men's.

683
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:36,246
Look here Chief.
Before you turn that man over

684
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:39,606
to the Mounted Police,
l got an order for his arrest

685
00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:42,960
not only from the US,
but from his own Chief, Riel.

686
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,478
And if you...

687
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:53,803
l'm paid 72 cents a day
to protect dummies like him.

688
00:48:55,089 --> 00:48:56,078
Peace.

689
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,527
We got no war with the Redcoat.

690
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:02,484
Yet. But they
no take away my friend.

691
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,880
You both come alone,
you both go alone.

692
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,448
l have spoken.

693
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:15,039
Big Bear was a great chief.
His friends will be sorry for him.

694
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:23,528
Now you die.

695
00:49:24,689 --> 00:49:29,683
You can kill me and take this back
but its medicine will be gone.

696
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:34,203
The great white mother gave you this
to let you rule over thousands.

697
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:37,639
You are not chief
unless she gives it back to you.

698
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:42,239
Big Bear will join his blood
brother and fight for Riel.

699
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:45,478
Go.

700
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:48,518
Big Bear,

701
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,797
you're a great Chief.

702
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:53,085
Why we heard of you
way down in Texas.

703
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:55,202
But how do you know
who's the best fighter?

704
00:49:55,249 --> 00:49:57,205
The Mounted Police or Corbeau,

705
00:49:58,169 --> 00:49:59,841
the great killer of men?

706
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:01,402
-You better get out.
-Rivers.

707
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:03,087
Peace. Talk.

708
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:07,565
Why this fellow's killed in Texas,
and killed in Canada.

709
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:12,362
He must be a great gunfighter,
but have you ever seen him kill?

710
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:14,646
How do you know
all these yarns are true?

711
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:16,521
l'll show you if they're true.

712
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:21,081
He offers to show you.
Let him kill now.

713
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:24,037
Who he kill?

714
00:50:25,129 --> 00:50:26,118
Me.

715
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:30,878
Another will die.

716
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:33,842
Slide my guns back in their cradles,
untie my hands

717
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:35,163
and l'll hold them out.

718
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:38,328
Then tell this tough man
to go to it.

719
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:43,762
Cut the thongs.
Put back the guns.

720
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:56,768
-The man is daft.
-He's great!

721
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:01,607
Now tell him to kill.

722
00:51:06,449 --> 00:51:07,438
Kill.

723
00:51:09,729 --> 00:51:11,401
Go ahead Corbeau. Draw.

724
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:13,918
Tell him to draw Big Bear.

725
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:17,598
He's been bragging about how
he's gonna kill? Start on me.

726
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:22,198
Kill.

727
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:25,922
Draw you yellow pole cat!

728
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:30,799
You're a good hand at shooting
men in the back. What's wrong now?.

729
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:41,168
l won't foul a great Chief's lodge
with the blood of a dog.

730
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:46,725
He's yapping across the trail,
to save his Redcoat friends.

731
00:51:47,129 --> 00:51:50,405
But the medicine gun,
she'll roll them all in the dirt.

732
00:51:51,169 --> 00:51:53,080
l have not seen this yet.

733
00:51:53,649 --> 00:51:54,638
Then look.

734
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:13,127
What a thing!

735
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:16,685
That gun strong medicine.

736
00:52:17,129 --> 00:52:19,245
Shooting painted horses
is not killing men.

737
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:21,485
Before the sun has set three times

738
00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:23,920
l'll bring you the Redcoats
of the Mounted Police,

739
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:28,322
made redder with their own blood
and full of holes like a net.

740
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:33,287
You're not a feather to be blown
about by the talk of a coward.

741
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:41,437
Bring me in your hand
their empty coat red with blood

742
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:45,644
before three suns have set

743
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:49,523
and my braves
will take the warpath.

744
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:53,319
Before three suns have set

745
00:52:53,689 --> 00:52:56,123
Corbeau will wear iron
on his hands.

746
00:52:57,969 --> 00:52:58,958
Come on!

747
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:17,689
Very nice entertainment indeed.

748
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:21,519
Now if you'll cut me loose l'll
endeavor to show my appreciation.

749
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:25,238
You're alright, Sheriff.
Let's mush.

750
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:28,289
-l came here to get that fellow.
-l think we'd better move

751
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:32,767
before Corbeau finds out the lndians
took the bullets out of your pistols.

752
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,445
l won't tell on you.
Come on.

753
00:53:54,409 --> 00:53:56,718
Whatever you did at Big Bear's
camp these men have undone.

754
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:57,844
What else could we do?

755
00:53:57,929 --> 00:53:59,521
Our horses were stolen
two nights ago.

756
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:03,437
You should have blown it up!
Leaving 10,000 rounds of ammunition

757
00:54:03,529 --> 00:54:05,565
at Duck Lake is inexcusable.

758
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,562
When my wife heard the half-breeds
were coming through Duck Lake

759
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:12,882
on their way to attack Prince Albert,
she grabbed the kid and we left.

760
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:14,482
Thank you. That's all.

761
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:17,527
l didn't think about saving
anything but our scalps.

762
00:54:20,209 --> 00:54:22,848
-We're going after that ammunition.
-Very good, sir.

763
00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:24,886
But Col. lrvine's relief force
is due shortly.

764
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:28,524
Relief or not, we cannot allow
that ammo to fall into Riel's hand.

765
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:31,078
-l don't like the smell of this.
-What do you mean?

766
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:34,167
l'm curious to learn
where Corbeau plans to find

767
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:37,042
the bullet ridden red coats
he promised Big Bear.

768
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,001
That won't be his first lie.

769
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:40,158
Sergeant.

770
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:46,484
You will post sentries
commanding Beardy's Basin.

771
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:48,281
That's the only place
we could be ambushed

772
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:49,808
this side of Duck Lake.

773
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:51,562
There's an old cabin there?

774
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:02,438
That's the cabin.

775
00:55:03,329 --> 00:55:04,887
See that Basin below you?

776
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:07,524
lf Riel's brigade cuts back from
the Prince Albert road

777
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:09,201
they'll come through
the river bed there.

778
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:11,639
Each man two hours on watch,
two hours rest.

779
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,647
Two hours on your feet,
and two hours on your back.

780
00:55:14,169 --> 00:55:16,399
At the first sign of the enemy
fall back at gallop and report.

781
00:55:16,569 --> 00:55:20,084
-All this time the half breed army...
-Moving in the other direction.

782
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:21,643
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

783
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:25,880
You'll be relieved tomorrow.
Bye. Keep your eyes open.

784
00:55:26,049 --> 00:55:27,198
Same to you.

785
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:52,998
Ekawe!

786
00:55:57,369 --> 00:56:00,247
You fix leg.

787
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:04,604
Come sit in this nice green chair.
Does the cast hurt you?

788
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:10,328
No, you help her good
that's why l help you.

789
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:15,126
-Help me? How?.
-You fix. Don't look at me.

790
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:19,684
Redcoat march for Duck Lake.

791
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:23,558
Half-breed, they wait in wood,
kill Redcoat.

792
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:26,326
But l thought Riel had
marched on Prince Albert.

793
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:28,162
That's just for trick.

794
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:31,766
They make trap
for Redcoat at Duck Lake.

795
00:56:33,169 --> 00:56:35,603
An ambush?
With the medicine gun?

796
00:56:36,249 --> 00:56:37,238
Yes.

797
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:41,880
Your brother keep watch
on cabin at Beardy's basin.

798
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,406
They gonna kill him tonight.

799
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:48,564
So he don't see them make
what you call ambush.

800
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:52,358
Ronnie!

801
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:54,478
Ronnie?

802
00:56:56,609 --> 00:57:00,397
You just trying to scare me.
l don't like you pretty much.

803
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:02,167
But it's Ronnie who's in danger.

804
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:07,246
-You think l like him too much?
-lf you like him, you can help him.

805
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:11,279
What do you mean, like?
l love Ronnie.

806
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:18,528
That's why you no like me.
You think l'm no good for him.

807
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:22,325
lf you love him,
you'll do as l ask.

808
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:26,279
He's on outpost duty
at the old cabin near Beardy's Basin.

809
00:57:26,729 --> 00:57:30,722
Go to him. Tell him to warn
the Police not to march on Duck Lake.

810
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:34,327
-Why don't you go?
-They won't let me leave Batoche.

811
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,683
Nobody would stop you.

812
00:57:36,649 --> 00:57:39,038
What you think?
Me save police?

813
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:43,001
Pretty soon my father
have all the whiskey business

814
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:45,160
and l wear silk and rings.

815
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:49,161
l think Ronnie like that.

816
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:54,562
lf you don't warn the Police,
Ronnie will hate you.

817
00:57:55,449 --> 00:57:59,761
Maybe that man you love,
that big sergeant gonna be killed.

818
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:06,359
Maybe bullet go through
that Scotch lndian.

819
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:08,406
-Louvette.
-Somofagum,

820
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:11,003
you think you better than me,
you go save them.

821
00:58:11,129 --> 00:58:14,724
l'm not better than you. lf you
want rings, l'll give them to you.

822
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:16,800
But don't lose anymore time.

823
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:23,723
l beg you on my knees
if that will make you go.

824
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:27,958
Soon medicine gun knock
police on their knees.

825
00:58:31,169 --> 00:58:35,481
Maybe tomorrow night the wolf
come for what is left.

826
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:40,567
You say you love Ronnie while
you brazenly sit there eating,

827
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:43,880
knowing he's gonna be killed.
There's nothing in you but hate.

828
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:45,758
You're a savage Louvette.

829
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:49,080
A vicious, cruel savage.
Blood and revenge is all you know,

830
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:51,889
-not love.
-Hey you!

831
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:55,200
l'll show you love.

832
00:58:56,929 --> 00:58:58,806
What you want l tell Ronnie?

833
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:00,838
You'll go?

834
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:03,478
Sure l go.

835
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:08,488
Tell Ronnie the half breeds
will ambush at Beardy's Basin.

836
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:12,277
Sure l tell him.
You go home now.

837
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:17,804
We'll never forget
what you've done for us.

838
00:59:19,249 --> 00:59:22,844
No. You won't forget.

839
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:29,925
-What's after you?
-A big bad rabbit.

840
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:31,882
Chased me all the way back.

841
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:34,684
-Male or female?
-l didn't ask.

842
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:38,758
My tobacco is in the saddle bag.

843
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:42,921
-Steal it sparingly.
-Thank you. l will.

844
00:59:54,169 --> 00:59:57,241
You need wife for clean the house.

845
00:59:58,129 --> 00:59:59,118
What in the...

846
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:05,728
What are you doing here?

847
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:11,325
-How'd you know l was here?
-My father is mad on me.

848
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:16,325
-Why?
-He find out l got big love for you.

849
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,639
Why didn't you tell me
Corbeau was your father?

850
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:23,201
Tonight he take plenty half breed

851
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:26,039
made big ride to Prince Albert.

852
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:28,367
-But when he come back...
-Answer me...

853
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,960
What do you care
who is my father?

854
01:00:38,249 --> 01:00:43,528
You hate Jacques Corbeau
more strong than you love Louvette.

855
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:47,885
l'd be bat brained about you
if your father was the devil himself.

856
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:51,925
You don't never marry
with me now.

857
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:56,759
Once this is over l'll marry you
quicker than you can say Somagum.

858
01:00:59,049 --> 01:01:00,368
That's too late.

859
01:01:03,249 --> 01:01:04,238
Why?

860
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:07,962
My father gonna kill me
'cause l love Redcoat.

861
01:01:09,329 --> 01:01:13,163
We be married tonight
or we don't be married never.

862
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:14,558
Tonight?

863
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,923
lndians shoot priest
at Frog Lake today.

864
01:01:18,169 --> 01:01:22,367
Now at Batoche, Duroc
he's scared for Father Piccard.

865
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:25,837
Gonna send him to Regina
when daylight come.

866
01:01:27,409 --> 01:01:30,685
Please,
he marry us before he go.

867
01:01:31,809 --> 01:01:35,882
-But l can't leave here.
-Nothing happen here.

868
01:01:37,129 --> 01:01:39,040
Why you here for anyway?

869
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:41,718
Orders.

870
01:01:42,529 --> 01:01:45,407
But you be back
before somebody know.

871
01:01:46,609 --> 01:01:48,201
Somofagum.

872
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:51,598
l love you so terrible much.

873
01:01:54,969 --> 01:01:59,485
But l'm on duty.
They'd hang me, shoot me,

874
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:00,998
boil me in oil.

875
01:02:04,049 --> 01:02:06,722
You don't love me
because who my father is.

876
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,727
Try to understand.
l have to watch the river bed.

877
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:26,567
That other fellow could watch.
Get in river bed with him.

878
01:02:29,489 --> 01:02:31,923
lf your neck wasn't so lovely
l'd break it.

879
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:34,242
You break the heart.

880
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:41,322
-Always l know you lie to me.
-No!

881
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,921
But that lie is sweet

882
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:49,319
and my heart,
she sing like a bird.

883
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,919
l don't live without you, Ronnie.

884
01:02:55,929 --> 01:02:59,763
You crazy little loon.
What do you think you'll do?

885
01:03:00,249 --> 01:03:03,207
-l'm going.
-No, you won't.

886
01:03:04,809 --> 01:03:07,403
You're the sweetest poison
that ever got in a man's blood.

887
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:10,398
l love you.

888
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:13,078
l want you.

889
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:20,639
We'll be in Batoche in one hour.

890
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:22,118
Maybe less.

891
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:26,527
Ten minutes with the priest.

892
01:03:28,009 --> 01:03:29,601
An hour to get back here.

893
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:34,838
Ronnie!

894
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:38,077
l'll leave word for Jerry he'll have
to take15 minutes of my guard.

895
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:40,678
He'll yell, but he's a good egg.

896
01:04:34,649 --> 01:04:35,638
Ronnie!

897
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:40,325
Ronnie, they're coming.

898
01:04:42,649 --> 01:04:44,162
Wake up, Ronnie.

899
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:49,805
Get back to the fort!

900
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:56,129
The half-breeds ride.
Warn the force! Ambush...

901
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:14,363
-What happened to this town?
-They all go Prince Albert

902
01:05:14,689 --> 01:05:16,008
to fight for Louis Riel.

903
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:18,724
We wait in here
for Father Piccard.

904
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:24,406
lt's dark as a weasel's bedroom.

905
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:39,524
Louvette!
The rifle!

906
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:45,848
Quick, Louvette!
The gun!

907
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:48,921
You don't need gun now, Ronnie.

908
01:05:56,209 --> 01:05:57,437
Tie him here.

909
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:09,567
You crawling black scum!

910
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:11,880
-Shut up.
-Don't you hit him.

911
01:06:12,209 --> 01:06:14,359
-Get out. Get out.
-Pay now.

912
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:22,519
Get out.

913
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:25,722
Get out.

914
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:33,997
Well, come on.

915
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:37,840
-Cut me loose.
-l got to keep you here.

916
01:06:38,209 --> 01:06:41,360
lf l don't you be killed
like the others.

917
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:43,966
You sneaking shewolf.

918
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:48,244
Killed? Like what others?

919
01:06:54,809 --> 01:07:00,281
ln Duck Lake woods 1,000 half
breed make trap for Redcoat.

920
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:08,158
The whole force
will be cut to pieces.

921
01:07:08,969 --> 01:07:10,880
-Every man of them.
-Yeah.

922
01:07:13,049 --> 01:07:14,926
But you're alive is all l care.

923
01:07:18,569 --> 01:07:22,926
You, dirty squaw.
Why didn't you tell me?

924
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:27,686
l'll kill you
when l get loose.

925
01:07:28,929 --> 01:07:33,286
When you be safe
you kill me all you want.

926
01:08:18,169 --> 01:08:20,603
Back to the column. Warn them
the outpost's been killed.

927
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,799
Danger of enemy on all sides.
Gallop.

928
01:08:31,929 --> 01:08:33,647
You'd better get back
with the column.

929
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:35,838
Thanks.

930
01:09:24,209 --> 01:09:26,006
That blue eyed klootch
has got him.

931
01:09:37,449 --> 01:09:40,839
-That's destroying evidence.
-Which might put that boy

932
01:09:40,929 --> 01:09:42,567
in front of a firing squad.

933
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,682
lf the whole column rides
into a death trap

934
01:09:46,969 --> 01:09:48,561
he'll deserve whatever he gets.

935
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:50,368
l was thinking of his sister.

936
01:09:51,129 --> 01:09:53,927
Do you think it'll help to make
her pay for his mistakes?

937
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:01,401
Somebody's paying for it
right now.

938
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:13,288
Sound commence firing.

939
01:10:30,929 --> 01:10:32,442
Take what cover you can find!

940
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:35,239
-Turn the wagons over for barricades!
-Yes, sir!

941
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:37,604
Bring those wagons forward!
Steady men!

942
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:00,000
-Load!
-That gun!

943
01:11:00,449 --> 01:11:02,599
She speak death like
the rattling snake.

944
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:05,442
Yes. She'll get me them
red coats for Big Bear.

945
01:11:11,649 --> 01:11:13,446
Now that side!

946
01:11:35,809 --> 01:11:38,277
Sergeant Bret and that Texan
are coming through.

947
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:40,560
-Give them fire cover!
-Yes, sir.

948
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:46,398
Clear there...

949
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:05,208
-Help the Sergeant.
-He's alright.

950
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:08,446
You got nine lives, Sergeant.

951
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:14,078
Have a spill bud?

952
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:16,726
No, thanks, just had one.

953
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,048
Keep your heads covered men.

954
01:12:28,129 --> 01:12:30,040
Still got one good arm Bill, use it.

955
01:12:30,569 --> 01:12:32,480
Take your time!
Don't waste a shot!

956
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:41,608
-Look at that hat. 20 bucks.
-Wear a feather.

957
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:54,726
Get us out of this crossfire.
Fall back on Carlton.

958
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:56,118
Yes, sir.

959
01:12:56,849 --> 01:12:58,999
Palmer, Rankin, root out
that snipers nest to the rear.

960
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:00,968
-Right that wagon for the wounded.
-Right.

961
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:03,159
First section,
open the Carlton road.

962
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:10,405
Sections on the right,
fall back 50 yards.

963
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:12,480
Left sections hold fast.

964
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,480
Bugler, sound retire
and continue firing.

965
01:13:18,049 --> 01:13:19,721
Pick up all rifles.
Don't leave any ammunition.

966
01:13:45,049 --> 01:13:47,961
Give me 10 men and l'll hold
the road while you drop back.

967
01:13:49,769 --> 01:13:52,488
You drop back with the men.
l'll hold the road.

968
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:56,563
l can't hear you.

969
01:14:32,329 --> 01:14:33,682
Louvette.

970
01:14:35,049 --> 01:14:36,721
Let me go to them.

971
01:14:38,209 --> 01:14:40,439
l'll do anything.
l'll give you anything.

972
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:46,322
No, Ronnie.
l don't let you be killed.

973
01:14:57,929 --> 01:14:58,918
Doctor!

974
01:15:13,249 --> 01:15:17,128
-We're back at Fort Carlton.
-How many got back?

975
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:20,484
-We don't know yet, sir.
-Many?

976
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:22,278
No, sir.

977
01:15:23,849 --> 01:15:27,205
They were in the woods thicker
than boiled beans on Tuesday.

978
01:15:27,929 --> 01:15:29,328
But we couldn't see them.

979
01:15:29,649 --> 01:15:32,402
Jerry was on outpost.
Why didn't he warn us?

980
01:15:32,609 --> 01:15:33,758
Jerry's dead.

981
01:15:33,849 --> 01:15:35,805
They must have got
Logan when they got Jerry.

982
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:38,280
Nobody got Logan.
He went over the hill.

983
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:41,083
-l heard the Sergeant.
-Look out!

984
01:15:41,289 --> 01:15:42,847
Ronnie didn't seem to be
that kind of a chap.

985
01:15:42,969 --> 01:15:45,005
lf Ronnie had the slugs
in his legs l've got in mine

986
01:15:45,089 --> 01:15:47,000
he couldn't have run so fast.

987
01:15:47,129 --> 01:15:49,768
Shut up, you fools!
That's his sister.

988
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:05,484
You always show up
where you can help.

989
01:16:05,809 --> 01:16:07,720
They let me leave Batoche
is morning.

990
01:16:07,969 --> 01:16:11,166
-What are they saying about Ronnie?
-They're all out of their heads.

991
01:16:11,689 --> 01:16:13,202
Do any of you know where Ronnie is?

992
01:16:14,489 --> 01:16:18,164
-They don't know, April.
-Keep that stretcher working, Sheriff.

993
01:16:20,169 --> 01:16:22,364
-Doctor, the inspector's real bad.
-Alright.

994
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:24,568
Get this man ready.
l'll be back.

995
01:16:25,089 --> 01:16:27,603
-Some brandy here.
-Sergeant, bring that brandy.

996
01:16:29,809 --> 01:16:31,606
-He's lost a lot of blood, no?
-Yes.

997
01:16:32,169 --> 01:16:34,000
-Jim...
-l'm glad you're safe

998
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:36,888
-but l wish you were anywhere else.
-l tried to get here in time.

999
01:16:37,449 --> 01:16:39,087
l could have saved all this...

1000
01:16:39,609 --> 01:16:41,600
l'd give that tourniquet
another twist.

1001
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:46,123
Where's Ronnie?

1002
01:16:46,529 --> 01:16:48,759
-ls he... is he...?
-No.

1003
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:52,522
l'm sorry. l have to go
to the lnspector now.

1004
01:16:53,329 --> 01:16:54,318
But...

1005
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,724
Don't fight. You'll be alright.

1006
01:16:58,809 --> 01:17:00,879
l told you to take care
of the men.

1007
01:17:01,449 --> 01:17:04,327
-Yes, but...
-Nevermind me. Get to the others.

1008
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:09,678
Yes, sir.

1009
01:17:11,369 --> 01:17:13,041
ls there an assault?

1010
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,359
-Not yet, sir.
-Man the bastions.

1011
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:17,957
l have, sir.

1012
01:17:19,289 --> 01:17:21,803
Did you get proof
that Logan deserted?

1013
01:17:23,969 --> 01:17:24,958
Yes, sir.

1014
01:17:25,769 --> 01:17:29,648
When this is over,
make it your job to get him.

1015
01:17:30,769 --> 01:17:32,248
Bring him to justice.

1016
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:35,038
Justice...

1017
01:17:36,009 --> 01:17:37,920
l'm about to get mind.

1018
01:17:39,849 --> 01:17:43,080
-Take command, Sergeant.
-Very good, sir.

1019
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:47,724
Some fool at Headquarters,

1020
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:51,888
wants to change
the uniform to green.

1021
01:17:53,889 --> 01:17:56,119
Stand up for the Redcoats.

1022
01:17:58,369 --> 01:17:59,768
lt's a good color.

1023
01:18:13,249 --> 01:18:16,002
-Any sign of a rush?
-Just steady sniping.

1024
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,128
-Tod...
-Keep your head down lad

1025
01:18:22,289 --> 01:18:24,883
-if you don't want to lose it.
-Can you reach the river?

1026
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:28,407
There's a very good chance.

1027
01:18:28,649 --> 01:18:32,198
Get the bateau and canoe
and moor them 100 yards below.

1028
01:18:32,329 --> 01:18:34,047
We'll try to get through tonight.

1029
01:18:35,369 --> 01:18:36,438
That l will.

1030
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:38,362
-Take his place.
-Right.

1031
01:18:45,689 --> 01:18:48,601
Look! Look What l see!

1032
01:18:59,369 --> 01:19:01,200
-Don't shoot.
-He is police scout.

1033
01:19:01,569 --> 01:19:03,241
He the Scotch man.

1034
01:19:03,969 --> 01:19:04,958
He's mine!

1035
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:08,437
Nobody shoot.

1036
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:29,878
Where is the knob from the bonnet?
Darn!

1037
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,007
Blood of the devil!

1038
01:19:38,329 --> 01:19:41,287
Bonjour,
you snake in the bush?

1039
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:43,923
Duroc, you old porcupine.

1040
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:52,004
-Foosh to you.
-You son of a pumpkin?

1041
01:20:02,809 --> 01:20:04,879
That's a pawky trick.

1042
01:20:08,089 --> 01:20:09,602
You snooling clootie!

1043
01:20:11,049 --> 01:20:12,641
Who is snooling clootie?

1044
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:24,198
You bairn of a buzzard.

1045
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:28,602
My yarn, my bonnie yarn!
l'll never dare to show...

1046
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:33,998
Aye.

1047
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,681
You... You skunk you.

1048
01:20:46,329 --> 01:20:50,561
Such a thing!

1049
01:20:51,489 --> 01:20:53,320
Darn these pants!

1050
01:20:56,049 --> 01:20:58,085
Hold 'em up with your teeth.

1051
01:21:02,369 --> 01:21:04,837
You, dirty Scotsman!

1052
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:16,365
Bonnie thing you look
going naked through the fen.

1053
01:21:17,329 --> 01:21:19,001
For goodness sakes!

1054
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:26,638
Yon goes the seat
of the government?

1055
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:29,042
Blood of a skunk.
l'll show you.

1056
01:21:38,129 --> 01:21:39,118
Pig!

1057
01:21:44,289 --> 01:21:46,803
Sharpshooter down there seems
to have McDuff cornered.

1058
01:21:47,049 --> 01:21:49,802
-Got a sight on him?
-No. He's behind...

1059
01:21:50,729 --> 01:21:51,718
Now l can.

1060
01:22:17,449 --> 01:22:18,962
Dan! Dan!

1061
01:22:22,289 --> 01:22:23,278
Dan...

1062
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:27,839
l didn't shoot you.

1063
01:22:30,569 --> 01:22:32,958
You win the 50 cents.

1064
01:22:33,169 --> 01:22:36,366
No Dan. lt was from the fort.
You showed yourself.

1065
01:22:36,729 --> 01:22:38,799
You're an old fool my friend.

1066
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:43,809
One more game of pinnacle

1067
01:22:44,889 --> 01:22:47,119
l skin from you the belt.

1068
01:22:47,289 --> 01:22:50,759
Aye, that you would Dan.

1069
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:54,439
-That you would.
-No, Tod.

1070
01:22:57,569 --> 01:22:58,558
l lose.

1071
01:22:59,489 --> 01:23:03,448
No, Dan, it is my loss,
every man's loss this day.

1072
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:08,124
The Big Trapper
got me by the neck.

1073
01:23:10,769 --> 01:23:12,839
The 50 cents

1074
01:23:15,089 --> 01:23:16,841
she's in my pocket.

1075
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:47,358
Soup?

1076
01:23:47,849 --> 01:23:50,807
-Any more soup and they'll bust?
-l must get this...

1077
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:53,284
-Stop carrying it long enough...
-But...

1078
01:23:53,889 --> 01:23:57,882
You've been ramming around here
for 10 hours, using up all

1079
01:23:57,969 --> 01:24:01,166
the Queen's bandages
and l never saw you beat.

1080
01:24:01,529 --> 01:24:03,406
Well, you haven't
been playing croquet.

1081
01:24:03,569 --> 01:24:07,244
Special orders is you stop now.
And have a cup of coffee.

1082
01:24:20,169 --> 01:24:21,807
Dusty, what happened?

1083
01:24:22,489 --> 01:24:23,478
Happened?

1084
01:24:24,169 --> 01:24:25,682
Did something happen?

1085
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:28,806
l didn't notice anything happening.

1086
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:39,287
l don't like women who cry.

1087
01:24:41,249 --> 01:24:42,807
You know something, lady?

1088
01:24:43,929 --> 01:24:46,284
l make the best coffee in Texas.

1089
01:24:47,329 --> 01:24:49,399
You can float a horseshoe
in my coffee.

1090
01:24:50,129 --> 01:24:53,485
Over and over l hear them say his
name but they won't tell me anything.

1091
01:24:54,769 --> 01:24:57,567
Look... just kind of

1092
01:24:58,129 --> 01:25:01,804
-get down some of this Java
-Even Jim won't tell me anything.

1093
01:25:05,369 --> 01:25:06,484
Two sugars?

1094
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:10,004
Jim is a great soldier.

1095
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:13,088
But if you don't drink
this here coffee...

1096
01:25:13,129 --> 01:25:15,882
Where is Ronnie?
What's happened to him?

1097
01:25:16,009 --> 01:25:17,681
Now listen...

1098
01:25:19,009 --> 01:25:22,160
l don't know Ronnie so very well
but l know you.

1099
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:27,043
The first time l saw you l knew
you better than anyone l've known.

1100
01:25:27,569 --> 01:25:31,403
l know it couldn't be in your
brother's blood to be cowardly.

1101
01:25:32,289 --> 01:25:33,278
But,

1102
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:37,366
love does funny things to people.

1103
01:25:50,929 --> 01:25:52,328
You've been a good soldier.

1104
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,998
l've got a tough job for you,
if you'll take it.

1105
01:25:58,449 --> 01:26:00,724
You want me to put
some salt on Corbeau's tail?

1106
01:26:01,369 --> 01:26:04,600
l'm trying to get the wounded
to the river under smoke cover.

1107
01:26:05,449 --> 01:26:07,360
-What smoke?
-We'll burn the fort.

1108
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:09,768
-Coffee?
-Thanks.

1109
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:12,519
lt'll be your job to get April
and the wounded down the river

1110
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:14,367
to meet Colonel lrvine's
reinforcements.

1111
01:26:14,809 --> 01:26:19,439
-You'll stay and roast chestnuts?
-l have 7 men sound enough to ride.

1112
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:22,607
l'll be there when Corbeau

1113
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:24,959
throws those red coats
in front of Big Bear.

1114
01:26:25,649 --> 01:26:28,368
Looks to me like you're just
delivering seven more red coats.

1115
01:26:28,889 --> 01:26:29,878
Maybe.

1116
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:34,278
Jim.

1117
01:26:36,049 --> 01:26:37,641
You've got to tell me.

1118
01:26:39,849 --> 01:26:40,838
l know it.

1119
01:26:42,569 --> 01:26:45,845
But let me tell you first
that l love you.

1120
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:51,885
Always l guess. You'll never
be able to look at me again.

1121
01:26:53,569 --> 01:26:55,639
Nothing under heaven
can ever bring us together...

1122
01:26:55,729 --> 01:26:57,321
What do you mean?

1123
01:27:00,809 --> 01:27:03,767
You've got to know it,
so l'd rather you knew it from me.

1124
01:27:05,409 --> 01:27:06,728
Ronnie is not dead.

1125
01:27:07,209 --> 01:27:08,198
He deserted.

1126
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:10,759
He left his post,
left his companion sentry.

1127
01:27:10,849 --> 01:27:11,918
He was killed.

1128
01:27:12,369 --> 01:27:13,927
He could have warned the column.

1129
01:27:14,129 --> 01:27:16,962
All those men lying dead
might still be living if Ronnie...

1130
01:27:18,169 --> 01:27:19,841
-but he ran away.
-No, no!

1131
01:27:20,009 --> 01:27:22,569
He ran away with that half breed
Corbeau's daughter!

1132
01:27:22,649 --> 01:27:27,006
But l sent her to him,
to warn him, to warn you.

1133
01:27:27,169 --> 01:27:29,239
Didn't you know he'd sell
his soul for that girl?

1134
01:27:29,849 --> 01:27:31,362
l don't believe Ronnie deserted.

1135
01:27:31,649 --> 01:27:34,243
lf you prove it to me 100 times,
l still won't believe it.

1136
01:27:37,089 --> 01:27:38,078
Jim lad,

1137
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:40,720
the half-breeds
being a wee bit confused

1138
01:27:40,849 --> 01:27:44,603
with the death of poor Dan Duroc.
lt's the time to be going.

1139
01:27:44,929 --> 01:27:47,363
Tell Corporal Underhill to have
the patrol in full dress order

1140
01:27:47,529 --> 01:27:50,680
sidearms and rifles
then set fire to the buildings.

1141
01:27:51,129 --> 01:27:53,085
Aye, all is ready then now.

1142
01:28:07,009 --> 01:28:09,159
l hope you never believe
Ronnie is guilty

1143
01:28:10,849 --> 01:28:12,601
but that doesn't change my job.

1144
01:28:14,449 --> 01:28:17,486
When this over l'm going
to get him and bring him back.

1145
01:28:19,089 --> 01:28:22,559
l will get him if l have
to follow him over the icecap.

1146
01:28:23,769 --> 01:28:25,839
You know what that means for him.

1147
01:28:27,089 --> 01:28:29,284
l know you're duty comes
before everything else.

1148
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:31,724
l know it means
more than mercy or love.

1149
01:28:32,089 --> 01:28:33,761
Go on, follow your orders.

1150
01:28:34,049 --> 01:28:37,007
Kill that boy who was foolish
enough to put love first!

1151
01:28:37,689 --> 01:28:39,759
But don't tell me
how sorry you are!

1152
01:28:40,889 --> 01:28:42,959
Just do your duty and kill!

1153
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:49,803
We'll take you and the wounded
as far as the river.

1154
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,559
Dusty will take care of you there.

1155
01:28:55,009 --> 01:28:57,000
We're going on to Big Bear's camp.

1156
01:28:59,009 --> 01:29:00,681
Pray that l don't come back.

1157
01:29:25,129 --> 01:29:27,199
You'll have to let me
look after you now.

1158
01:29:28,289 --> 01:29:30,723
-Better throw some wash in my face.
-What?

1159
01:29:31,729 --> 01:29:33,560
l have no right to be crying
over my troubles.

1160
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:37,006
The wounded must be moved. They'll
need all the help we can give.

1161
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,439
Looks like you need
some help yourself lady.

1162
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:46,602
Attent hut!

1163
01:29:51,129 --> 01:29:52,721
This is a volunteer patrol.

1164
01:29:53,609 --> 01:29:55,281
Once we've entered Big Bear's camp

1165
01:29:55,449 --> 01:29:58,088
no man of you can properly
expect to come out alive.

1166
01:30:00,969 --> 01:30:05,645
lf any of you prefer to go
with the wounded you may fall out.

1167
01:30:09,809 --> 01:30:10,798
Thank you.

1168
01:30:13,889 --> 01:30:14,958
Fyffe, you're hurt.

1169
01:30:15,609 --> 01:30:17,167
You'll have to go with the wounded.

1170
01:30:17,289 --> 01:30:19,723
No, l'm alright.
l can fight.

1171
01:30:19,889 --> 01:30:22,608
Join the wounded as directed.

1172
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,198
Yes, sir.

1173
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:31,199
We'll take the wounded
to the river first.

1174
01:30:31,529 --> 01:30:32,882
Keep them under cover.

1175
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:36,438
Corporal, mount the patrol.

1176
01:30:37,289 --> 01:30:39,484
Patrol! Prepare to mount.

1177
01:30:43,809 --> 01:30:45,640
They die in there you think.

1178
01:30:46,129 --> 01:30:49,201
Maybe so.
l don't see nobody come out.

1179
01:30:59,449 --> 01:31:01,440
Men with leg wounds
man the paddles.

1180
01:31:03,049 --> 01:31:05,961
Dusty and McDuff,
scout the shores with a canoe.

1181
01:31:13,649 --> 01:31:15,765
lt's a dangerous place
you choose lassie.

1182
01:31:15,849 --> 01:31:17,840
l can't leave these two men.
They're the worst hurt.

1183
01:31:25,649 --> 01:31:27,128
Good luck, Soldier.

1184
01:31:29,169 --> 01:31:30,158
Thanks.

1185
01:32:19,649 --> 01:32:22,641
That'll be Colonel lrvine's
relief column.

1186
01:32:22,889 --> 01:32:24,117
ln camp, beyond the bend.

1187
01:32:24,889 --> 01:32:26,607
That's a pretty sounding noise.

1188
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:29,439
l was afraid these boys
would never see that camp.

1189
01:32:30,449 --> 01:32:33,885
You're going to and you'll
get some rest. l'm leaving.

1190
01:32:34,769 --> 01:32:37,237
-Why?
-Going hunting.

1191
01:32:37,809 --> 01:32:40,528
lt's no use.
Jim has Corbeau by now.

1192
01:32:42,129 --> 01:32:44,962
-Or Corbeau has...
-l wasn't thinking about Corbeau.

1193
01:32:47,329 --> 01:32:48,318
Ronnie?

1194
01:32:50,049 --> 01:32:54,565
Well, l'd like to have a powow
with the wolfgirl he's been with.

1195
01:32:55,849 --> 01:32:57,840
Ronnie's dead. l know he is.

1196
01:32:58,289 --> 01:33:02,965
He wouldn't run away.
He'd come back and face it.

1197
01:33:04,009 --> 01:33:08,878
Sure he would.
Maybe he can't come back.

1198
01:33:10,049 --> 01:33:11,687
Maybe he sort of lost his head.

1199
01:33:13,169 --> 01:33:17,208
l got a feeling l can make
things easier for you

1200
01:33:17,809 --> 01:33:18,798
if you'd let me.

1201
01:33:20,889 --> 01:33:25,599
You're grand person, but there's
nothing anyone can do for me.

1202
01:33:26,929 --> 01:33:29,807
Sure there is.
Come to Texas with me.

1203
01:33:31,529 --> 01:33:33,759
lf Ronnie's alive,
he'll find us there.

1204
01:33:35,129 --> 01:33:39,680
l'll never see Ronnie again.
He's gone.

1205
01:33:40,889 --> 01:33:43,278
Not when somebody cares as much
about you as l do.

1206
01:33:45,489 --> 01:33:48,162
lf you want what's left of me
after all this

1207
01:33:48,809 --> 01:33:49,958
l'll go with you.

1208
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:55,878
l'm a coward Dusty!
l want to run away.

1209
01:33:59,049 --> 01:34:01,688
You're the loveliest and
gentlest woman l've ever known

1210
01:34:03,729 --> 01:34:06,004
but you haven't closed
your eyes in 24 hours.

1211
01:34:07,449 --> 01:34:10,009
l don't want you to say yes
without thinking.

1212
01:34:10,209 --> 01:34:12,040
l don't want to think.

1213
01:34:13,849 --> 01:34:16,966
When we get to Texas,
you won't have to.

1214
01:34:19,569 --> 01:34:23,482
-Texas must be heaven.
-lt will be when you get there.

1215
01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:35,601
Pull into shore Tod, then take
April down to lrvine's camp.

1216
01:34:35,929 --> 01:34:37,521
l'm splitting off here.

1217
01:34:37,849 --> 01:34:39,999
What manner of frisky
are you up to now?.

1218
01:34:41,569 --> 01:34:44,641
Well, there's a couple
of things l got to do.

1219
01:34:52,889 --> 01:34:58,282
l kept my promise Big Bear.
Red coats full of holes like a net.

1220
01:34:59,849 --> 01:35:03,762
This one belonged to that Sergeant
who said he'd put me in irons.

1221
01:35:07,689 --> 01:35:09,805
Medicine gun speak like thunder.

1222
01:35:10,449 --> 01:35:13,122
Keep your promise, Big Bear.
War!

1223
01:35:20,569 --> 01:35:22,605
Kill. War!

1224
01:35:23,089 --> 01:35:24,078
War!

1225
01:36:07,449 --> 01:36:09,201
So dead men ride?

1226
01:36:38,169 --> 01:36:40,080
You cannot kill the dead.

1227
01:36:53,249 --> 01:36:56,559
Tell your war chief to spread
his blanket on the ground Big Bear?

1228
01:36:56,969 --> 01:36:59,244
Tell your men to fire!
Kill the dogs!

1229
01:37:02,409 --> 01:37:04,320
You tell me they are dead.

1230
01:37:04,729 --> 01:37:07,323
Let us know what dead men want.

1231
01:37:08,449 --> 01:37:12,237
Nestestu! Put the blanket here.

1232
01:37:12,889 --> 01:37:13,878
The blanket!

1233
01:37:17,569 --> 01:37:19,161
Put the blanket here.

1234
01:37:21,449 --> 01:37:24,566
The spirits of the brave
are still inside their red coats.

1235
01:37:25,369 --> 01:37:29,282
They are sacred. Tell your men
to lay them on the blanket.

1236
01:37:33,689 --> 01:37:36,840
The brothers of the dead
are brave.

1237
01:37:38,369 --> 01:37:41,202
Put them on the blanket.

1238
01:37:43,689 --> 01:37:48,126
No, no! These enemies are
in your hands. Pull them down!

1239
01:37:48,249 --> 01:37:51,002
Kill them! Now!

1240
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:05,441
lf one shot is fired,
the soldiers of the Queen

1241
01:38:05,569 --> 01:38:07,844
will come like the sands
of the great salt sea.

1242
01:38:08,609 --> 01:38:10,645
You and your sons will die

1243
01:38:11,089 --> 01:38:14,399
and your children's children
will never walk on the Earth.

1244
01:38:18,529 --> 01:38:21,999
The other coats Big Bear.
We are waiting.

1245
01:38:25,129 --> 01:38:27,040
Put the coats on the blanket.

1246
01:38:35,049 --> 01:38:36,846
Pull 'em off the horses!
Kill them!

1247
01:38:42,209 --> 01:38:45,884
Are you afraid of 7 men?
Kill them, you fools!

1248
01:38:52,249 --> 01:38:54,638
There's no magic in their red coats.

1249
01:38:58,689 --> 01:39:00,361
Throw them to the crows.

1250
01:39:00,689 --> 01:39:01,678
Like this.

1251
01:39:02,889 --> 01:39:04,208
You're under arrest!

1252
01:39:05,569 --> 01:39:07,480
Shoot, you fools! Shoot!

1253
01:39:08,289 --> 01:39:09,278
Shut up!

1254
01:39:09,929 --> 01:39:11,806
Two men on the left, dismount.

1255
01:39:15,889 --> 01:39:17,208
Take the prisoner.

1256
01:39:17,289 --> 01:39:20,008
-On your feet, now.
-What's the matter? Tired?

1257
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:22,679
You're too heavy to carry.

1258
01:39:29,649 --> 01:39:31,367
Will Big Bear kneel to the Queen

1259
01:39:31,609 --> 01:39:33,998
and be the chief
of his people again?

1260
01:39:35,609 --> 01:39:38,760
The Cree
are brothers to the brave.

1261
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:55,722
This fellow keep Redcoats
out of Batoche.

1262
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:18,798
Look!

1263
01:40:22,889 --> 01:40:24,925
The canoes go down river
by himself!

1264
01:40:25,249 --> 01:40:26,921
lt's my bateau, come on!

1265
01:41:06,849 --> 01:41:08,248
Look! Come on!

1266
01:41:08,449 --> 01:41:10,565
-Let's go!
-Don't let him go.

1267
01:41:19,209 --> 01:41:20,608
You know Louvette?

1268
01:41:21,689 --> 01:41:24,920
No Gatling gun, no Riel,
no lndians, no fight.

1269
01:41:25,129 --> 01:41:27,768
You come home,
l give you all the fight you want.

1270
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:29,477
Yes, mama.

1271
01:41:34,929 --> 01:41:37,568
-You know Louvette Corbeau?
-l know no one like that.

1272
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:39,601
Well, l guess that's right.

1273
01:41:43,329 --> 01:41:45,559
-You want something?
-You know Louvette?

1274
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:47,327
-Yes.
-Of course.

1275
01:41:48,209 --> 01:41:51,884
-Louvette Corbeau?
-Sure. Come on.

1276
01:42:09,849 --> 01:42:11,077
Are you hungry?

1277
01:42:13,649 --> 01:42:14,638
No.

1278
01:42:18,609 --> 01:42:20,520
You don't feel good, huh?

1279
01:42:22,689 --> 01:42:23,917
l feel alright.

1280
01:42:25,809 --> 01:42:27,925
A man's brain can be sick.

1281
01:42:29,169 --> 01:42:33,162
He goes on breathing
and living until he rots.

1282
01:42:34,209 --> 01:42:38,725
My heart wants you so much.
She all the time say your name.

1283
01:42:39,449 --> 01:42:41,246
Ronnie, Ronnie...

1284
01:42:41,449 --> 01:42:44,566
l should have torn your tongue out
the first time l heard you say that.

1285
01:42:47,049 --> 01:42:48,960
No, we go away Ronnie.

1286
01:42:49,929 --> 01:42:51,681
Way up to far North.

1287
01:42:52,569 --> 01:42:54,161
To land of little sticks.

1288
01:42:55,129 --> 01:42:57,245
Nobody don't find us there.

1289
01:42:59,689 --> 01:43:01,759
One man l can't get away
from even there.

1290
01:43:04,809 --> 01:43:08,279
A filthy rat that can't
stand the sight of his own face.

1291
01:43:10,169 --> 01:43:11,158
Me.

1292
01:43:11,289 --> 01:43:13,803
My love, l make you forget.

1293
01:43:14,129 --> 01:43:15,118
Forget?

1294
01:43:15,769 --> 01:43:17,680
l ought to...!

1295
01:43:18,649 --> 01:43:20,162
You want to kill me?

1296
01:43:23,049 --> 01:43:25,005
l'm too much of a coward
even to do that.

1297
01:43:31,329 --> 01:43:32,728
Because l love you.

1298
01:43:35,569 --> 01:43:37,241
Two wild geese go north.

1299
01:43:45,049 --> 01:43:46,118
Hello, Ronnie.

1300
01:43:52,209 --> 01:43:53,608
Why you come here?

1301
01:43:53,889 --> 01:43:56,005
l was just passing by.

1302
01:44:05,209 --> 01:44:08,281
lt looks like this war
is kind of bogged down.

1303
01:44:09,249 --> 01:44:11,399
You come here for hurt him?

1304
01:44:12,449 --> 01:44:16,362
Nothing l say could hurt him any.
lt's already been said.

1305
01:44:18,289 --> 01:44:20,644
-What's been said?
-Don't listen to him, Ronnie.

1306
01:44:21,529 --> 01:44:22,848
l want to know!

1307
01:44:25,049 --> 01:44:26,038
Well,

1308
01:44:27,809 --> 01:44:31,324
that you ran from your post
and you're hiding out like a skunk

1309
01:44:31,529 --> 01:44:34,646
and haven't got what it takes
to go back and swallow your medicine.

1310
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:37,360
-Does April say that?
-No.

1311
01:44:38,129 --> 01:44:39,801
She figures you're dead.

1312
01:44:40,169 --> 01:44:43,081
She knows if you could even crawl
you'd get back there to face 'em.

1313
01:44:43,209 --> 01:44:44,528
Don't listen to him!

1314
01:44:45,129 --> 01:44:47,040
lf you go back they kill you.

1315
01:44:49,249 --> 01:44:52,878
She may be right.
The militia's brought in martial law.

1316
01:44:55,249 --> 01:44:59,322
You know the Mounted Police
are a great body of men.

1317
01:45:00,209 --> 01:45:04,725
For years they've been through hell
without a yellow mark against them.

1318
01:45:05,329 --> 01:45:08,446
l'd hate to see April's brother
be the first to chalk one up.

1319
01:45:08,929 --> 01:45:12,285
Make him go away.
He just talk crazy lie for you.

1320
01:45:14,089 --> 01:45:19,117
-l'm heading for Batoche, coming?
-No, Ronnie, no!

1321
01:45:25,649 --> 01:45:26,638
You coming?

1322
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:28,518
What for?

1323
01:45:30,409 --> 01:45:33,879
l'm already buried in the grave
of every man killed at Duck Lake.

1324
01:45:36,849 --> 01:45:39,966
-They're bound to find you.
-With your help?

1325
01:45:41,209 --> 01:45:43,518
No, they don't never find.

1326
01:45:45,889 --> 01:45:48,801
l fix so you don't tell nothing.

1327
01:45:58,689 --> 01:46:04,127
l won't turn you in,
but April's got a right to know.

1328
01:46:08,089 --> 01:46:09,886
Why don't you let me stay dead?

1329
01:46:11,529 --> 01:46:13,520
Because you're not a coward.

1330
01:46:23,369 --> 01:46:26,202
Whiteman, ride horse
with white face.

1331
01:46:38,889 --> 01:46:40,038
Go quick, Crow.

1332
01:46:43,049 --> 01:46:44,562
Go get him.

1333
01:46:50,489 --> 01:46:55,085
Viva Canadian womens,
fly my heart, fly high!

1334
01:46:55,209 --> 01:46:58,645
Viva Canadian womens,
who has so sweet the eyes!

1335
01:46:58,849 --> 01:47:03,161
Who has so sweet the eye!
Who has so sweet the eye!

1336
01:47:11,009 --> 01:47:11,998
Ronnie?

1337
01:47:14,689 --> 01:47:17,078
He's gone to Batoche.
l loaned him my horse.

1338
01:47:23,489 --> 01:47:24,478
Ronnie!

1339
01:47:40,169 --> 01:47:41,158
Ronnie!

1340
01:47:48,569 --> 01:47:49,558
Ronnie!

1341
01:47:59,889 --> 01:48:00,878
Ronnie...

1342
01:48:26,569 --> 01:48:27,558
Kill...

1343
01:48:31,329 --> 01:48:32,921
Kill...

1344
01:48:37,769 --> 01:48:40,044
Kill...

1345
01:48:42,289 --> 01:48:45,247
How much l morn for you...

1346
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:23,963
Love does funny things
to people.

1347
01:49:43,489 --> 01:49:45,480
Captain Gower
of the Canadian Militia

1348
01:49:45,689 --> 01:49:47,088
is here to help us get what facts

1349
01:49:47,129 --> 01:49:49,245
we can concerning the ambush
at Duck Lake

1350
01:49:49,689 --> 01:49:51,759
before the General
convenes his court martial.

1351
01:49:51,889 --> 01:49:52,878
Yes, sir.

1352
01:49:53,049 --> 01:49:55,279
l'm the one to blame.
Not my brother.

1353
01:49:55,609 --> 01:49:58,077
l sent her to him,
sent her to warn him.

1354
01:49:58,249 --> 01:50:01,002
Miss Logan,
none of us are on trial.

1355
01:50:01,329 --> 01:50:03,206
We're only trying
to find out what happened.

1356
01:50:04,009 --> 01:50:05,965
l should have known Louvette
would lie to him.

1357
01:50:06,249 --> 01:50:07,841
-That she...
-That she was in love with him

1358
01:50:08,169 --> 01:50:11,286
and would persuade him
to run away with her.

1359
01:50:11,489 --> 01:50:13,400
That's not true!
Ronnie wasn't afraid of anything.

1360
01:50:14,329 --> 01:50:16,126
lf he's alive, he'll come back.

1361
01:50:16,489 --> 01:50:21,563
l'm very sorry but the evidence
we've gathered is conclusive.

1362
01:50:23,569 --> 01:50:27,084
Sergeant, you are personal
assignment is to keep after Logan

1363
01:50:27,569 --> 01:50:30,447
until you've place him under arrest.

1364
01:50:32,249 --> 01:50:33,238
Yes, sir.

1365
01:50:33,329 --> 01:50:35,797
-That is all!
-Capitan Gower...

1366
01:50:36,209 --> 01:50:40,282
-What is it?
-l don't know. Someone got killed.

1367
01:50:41,329 --> 01:50:43,081
Fall back!
Fall back there!

1368
01:50:44,369 --> 01:50:46,246
Constable Logan reporting.

1369
01:50:50,729 --> 01:50:51,718
Ronnie!

1370
01:50:58,249 --> 01:51:00,843
-Who is this man?
-An American Peace Officer,

1371
01:51:01,009 --> 01:51:02,522
Texas Rangers.

1372
01:51:02,569 --> 01:51:03,888
ls this Constable Logan's body?

1373
01:51:04,009 --> 01:51:06,443
-Yes, sir.
-l don't understand.

1374
01:51:06,889 --> 01:51:10,438
This boy was captured. Look at
his wrists where the thongs cut in.

1375
01:51:12,369 --> 01:51:14,121
They thought you ran away...

1376
01:51:21,089 --> 01:51:23,125
The man has been bound certainly.

1377
01:51:23,529 --> 01:51:26,566
l don't know how he got loose
but when l saw him he was free.

1378
01:51:26,929 --> 01:51:29,204
Maybe he could have got back
to report but he didn't.

1379
01:51:29,609 --> 01:51:31,998
Because there was something
he wanted

1380
01:51:32,769 --> 01:51:34,600
more than he wanted
his own life.

1381
01:51:37,009 --> 01:51:40,524
-What do you mean?
-l mean the Gatling gun.

1382
01:51:41,289 --> 01:51:43,439
What did Logan have to do
with the Gatling gun?

1383
01:51:44,009 --> 01:51:46,842
The half-breeds had it on the bluff,
commanding the south approach.

1384
01:51:47,169 --> 01:51:50,479
We saw what happens to troops
who rush a gun like that.

1385
01:51:50,729 --> 01:51:53,562
But the kid could rush it because
he was on the inside of their lines.

1386
01:51:54,049 --> 01:51:56,609
Now you all decided
he quit his post.

1387
01:51:57,329 --> 01:51:59,638
Where l come from
we don't jump to conclusions.

1388
01:51:59,769 --> 01:52:02,158
lt's liable to be
a fellow's last jump.

1389
01:52:03,369 --> 01:52:05,121
l can tell you every move
the boy made.

1390
01:52:05,449 --> 01:52:08,327
And l can tell you this,
if you'd had 3 more men like him

1391
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:10,684
you'd have put down
your rebellion in 24 hours.

1392
01:52:11,129 --> 01:52:15,088
He got their boats in the river
to pull the crew

1393
01:52:15,209 --> 01:52:17,325
away from the gun,
then he got a horse

1394
01:52:17,449 --> 01:52:20,521
and dragged the gun off
riding like a bat out of hell.

1395
01:52:21,009 --> 01:52:23,762
The half-breeds spotted him
but he got the bluff above the river.

1396
01:52:25,129 --> 01:52:27,165
Bullets were as thick as flies

1397
01:52:27,209 --> 01:52:30,838
but they didn't stop him
over he goes, horse, man, and gun

1398
01:52:30,929 --> 01:52:33,443
rolling like a Texas
twister over the sheer drop.

1399
01:52:34,209 --> 01:52:35,528
That's where l find him.

1400
01:52:36,169 --> 01:52:39,002
That's where you'll find the gun
at the bottom of the river.

1401
01:52:40,929 --> 01:52:43,443
He never gave up.
He never quit.

1402
01:52:43,569 --> 01:52:46,686
He never ran away from anything
because it wasn't in him to run.

1403
01:52:48,009 --> 01:52:51,479
He just kept going on like
l think you'd want him to.

1404
01:52:52,129 --> 01:52:55,485
Constable Logan shall receive
the highest military honors.

1405
01:52:56,169 --> 01:52:59,320
l'll mention Logan's bravery
to General Middleton.

1406
01:53:00,689 --> 01:53:02,725
Where were you all this time?

1407
01:53:05,129 --> 01:53:08,121
l was squeezed under a log
so tight l was

1408
01:53:08,529 --> 01:53:10,838
breathing on the installment plan.

1409
01:53:12,009 --> 01:53:15,160
Shall l include that in my letter
to your Texas Commandant?

1410
01:53:18,009 --> 01:53:22,161
l hope you won't. l'll be
in trouble enough without Corbeau.

1411
01:53:26,209 --> 01:53:27,198
Dusty!

1412
01:53:29,129 --> 01:53:30,721
You're an angel in leather.

1413
01:53:32,729 --> 01:53:35,197
l'd look funny with leather wings.

1414
01:53:44,449 --> 01:53:47,043
l'm sorry l misjudged a brave man.

1415
01:53:48,409 --> 01:53:49,398
Yes, we...

1416
01:53:50,649 --> 01:53:51,638
all are.

1417
01:53:54,769 --> 01:53:55,758
Sergeant!

1418
01:53:56,089 --> 01:53:58,922
You will deliver prisoners
Riel and Corbeau to Regina.

1419
01:54:00,689 --> 01:54:03,078
-Last stop before Regina.
-Long way to ride

1420
01:54:03,249 --> 01:54:05,763
-before a hanging.
-They don't think so.

1421
01:54:12,129 --> 01:54:14,882
You be tying a wet knot.

1422
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:22,563
Eight days with them
traveling 200 miles.

1423
01:54:22,849 --> 01:54:25,124
Cold molasses could move faster.

1424
01:54:28,009 --> 01:54:29,203
Thank you.

1425
01:54:29,329 --> 01:54:34,244
-Where's Jim?
-Went riding with April.

1426
01:54:37,369 --> 01:54:41,123
lf l should disappear,
you know, vanish

1427
01:54:41,449 --> 01:54:45,078
will you tell April
l'll be back for her?

1428
01:54:45,649 --> 01:54:48,527
lf you're as blind on the trail
as you are with your lassie

1429
01:54:48,809 --> 01:54:51,767
you'll never find your way back.

1430
01:54:52,609 --> 01:54:55,407
l could never manage
one of these contraptions.

1431
01:54:57,369 --> 01:54:58,961
lt's a shame to waste it.

1432
01:55:12,689 --> 01:55:15,328
Either the hand of fate or

1433
01:55:15,809 --> 01:55:18,164
someone thinks
you ought to shave?

1434
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:24,238
Well?

1435
01:55:25,529 --> 01:55:29,966
No, one maybe can get through,
but there's no chance for two.

1436
01:55:30,649 --> 01:55:32,480
Find your own finish.

1437
01:55:32,849 --> 01:55:35,238
l'm ready for mine
whatever it may be.

1438
01:55:53,129 --> 01:55:55,006
l'll have my knife back now.

1439
01:55:57,649 --> 01:55:58,877
l give it to you!

1440
01:56:00,009 --> 01:56:01,601
No, sunny side up.

1441
01:56:05,729 --> 01:56:08,118
Now we're heading back for Texas.

1442
01:56:08,649 --> 01:56:12,722
l hid your horse under that
silver mine you call a saddle.

1443
01:56:31,369 --> 01:56:32,688
Just a minute, cowboy!

1444
01:56:50,169 --> 01:56:51,158
Going somewhere?

1445
01:56:53,529 --> 01:56:55,884
Don't look like
l'm going very far.

1446
01:56:56,369 --> 01:57:00,362
Come on out, April. lt's nobody
but Dusty taking a little ride.

1447
01:57:02,169 --> 01:57:04,319
Just trying to get away from it all.

1448
01:57:10,769 --> 01:57:12,680
Can we ride a little way
with you, Dusty?

1449
01:57:16,569 --> 01:57:18,480
Why yes, ma'am.

1450
01:57:28,209 --> 01:57:32,202
Do Canadians ever go
snow blind in the summer?

1451
01:57:34,609 --> 01:57:37,407
We're all a little blind sometimes.

1452
01:57:37,609 --> 01:57:38,598
l'm not.

1453
01:57:38,809 --> 01:57:42,199
There's talk some fellow may try
to get Corbeau away from us.

1454
01:57:43,249 --> 01:57:46,207
-How's that again?
-lt's only 100 miles

1455
01:57:46,369 --> 01:57:48,883
from the Montana border.
And no telegraph.

1456
01:57:50,609 --> 01:57:51,598
ls that so?

1457
01:57:52,049 --> 01:57:54,643
l'll check when l get back.
lf anyone's missing

1458
01:57:54,849 --> 01:57:56,805
l'll have every man in the troop
after them.

1459
01:57:58,329 --> 01:58:00,604
l can't say l blame you.

1460
01:58:01,009 --> 01:58:03,398
Jim, Dusty seems a little restless.

1461
01:58:04,369 --> 01:58:07,247
Maybe he's thinking about a man
who moved in on a friend

1462
01:58:07,449 --> 01:58:08,518
that trusted him.

1463
01:58:08,689 --> 01:58:10,884
Sneaked in behind his back like
a weasel in a hen coop

1464
01:58:11,009 --> 01:58:13,682
and stole the one thing
his friend valued most.

1465
01:58:15,289 --> 01:58:17,007
No, l wasn't thinking
about that.

1466
01:58:17,329 --> 01:58:18,808
Wouldn't you say
he'd loathe his friend

1467
01:58:18,889 --> 01:58:21,278
for doing such a low
contemptible thing to him?

1468
01:58:21,809 --> 01:58:23,800
He'd certainly owe him
an apology.

1469
01:58:24,129 --> 01:58:26,279
Well? l apologize.

1470
01:58:28,689 --> 01:58:30,008
You apologize?

1471
01:58:31,409 --> 01:58:32,922
Jim's trying to tell you that

1472
01:58:33,249 --> 01:58:35,843
he's taking something
he thought belonged to you.

1473
01:58:38,369 --> 01:58:39,358
You?

1474
01:58:39,729 --> 01:58:41,003
lf l'm free.

1475
01:58:42,009 --> 01:58:45,001
She told me once, l'd be alright
if something beat me to my knees.

1476
01:58:45,969 --> 01:58:47,402
l've been brought down hard.

1477
01:58:48,169 --> 01:58:52,208
No, l'm the one who surrendered.
But l wouldn't change him.

1478
01:58:54,489 --> 01:58:56,878
l guess l've just been having
a beautiful pipe dream

1479
01:58:57,009 --> 01:58:58,761
in the middle of a nightmare.

1480
01:58:59,569 --> 01:59:00,558
Sure.

1481
01:59:01,249 --> 01:59:02,762
Sure, you're free.

1482
01:59:03,769 --> 01:59:07,444
You got what we both want,
l got what l came for.

1483
01:59:08,689 --> 01:59:10,008
l'll say the Mounted Police

1484
01:59:10,089 --> 01:59:12,159
are the greatest outfit
l ever tangled with

1485
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:14,883
and the luckiest.

1486
01:59:15,209 --> 01:59:17,882
Texas Rangers are two fisted
fighters themselves.

1487
01:59:18,369 --> 01:59:21,361
And one of them is the most
magnificent liar in the world.

1488
01:59:26,409 --> 01:59:27,478
Goodbye, Dusty.

1489
01:59:30,889 --> 01:59:32,641
Texas is gonna miss you.

1490
01:59:33,329 --> 01:59:36,162
There'll always be a part
of Texas in our hearts.

1491
01:59:39,569 --> 01:59:41,161
Come on, sweetheart.

1492
02:00:01,169 --> 02:00:02,761
Come on, sweetheart.
