00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,767
'"Go up, go up," he says'

164
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,803
'Well, he knew
we had to keep moving'

165
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,038
'or we'd freeze to death
right there and then'

166
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,073
'and that would
be the end of it.'

167
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,309
'So, I took his advice,
yelled to the boys'

168
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,444
'"Rope yourselves.
We're going up."'

169
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,080
'Everybody looked at me
as if I was bloody crazy'

170
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,150
'but I wasn't, this dumb
son of a bitch was crazy.'

171
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:33,020
He was crazy, you know.
If it hadn't been for you

172
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,856
we'd be buried up to our
bollocks in some icy grave.

173
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,058
There was no..

174
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:43,997
Gentlemen, our guest
has arrived, Jane.

175
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,167
Excuse me.
Jane.

176
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,682
Yes, uh, gentlemen..

177
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:07,287
...may I introduce to one
and all, Ms. Jane Parker.

178
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:12,826
Her mother and I
were separated

179
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,963
when she was quite young.

180
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,730
(Jane)
'That's a lie.'

181
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,667
He left my mother

182
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,569
a year after I was born.

183
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,174
Ah. Six thousand miles
to tell me what a bastard I am.

184
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,078
What did mama say when you told
her you were coming to Africa?

185
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,913
Nothing.

186
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,083
She was dead
when I decided.

187
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,288
Oh, my God.

188
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,957
(Jane)
'She had a beautiful funeral.'

189
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,961
All her loved ones were there.

190
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,565
'I left a week later.'

191
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,955
Gentlemen.

192
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,157
Gent-gentlemen, I..

193
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,460
I believe
the dinner is over.

194
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,704
(Holt)
Ms. Parker?

195
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,141
I think your father
would be best left alone--

196
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,477
'Oh, for God's sake, Holt!
Get out and leave her.'

197
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,012
Thank you.

198
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,662
- I'm sorry.
- That's all?

199
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,431
That's all you have to say?

200
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,634
No, no, that is not all
I have to say.

201
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,437
There are a million,
trillion things I want to say

202
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:08,808
but all I can say is,
I loved her so.

203
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,479
Oh! I see.

204
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,382
That is a good reason to leave.

205
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:22,922
You don't find me
a very pretty sight, do you?

206
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,327
I don't find you
a pretty sight.

207
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,164
'Because of you, I was born.'

208
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,802
'But you only came to me
through newspaper clippings'

209
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,771
'telling me how you were
out trading your soul away'

210
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,041
'for one more grand adventure.'

211
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:46,313
Mother's estate makes me
very, very rich.

212
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,652
I could buy everything you own.
Buy it right out from under you.

213
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,522
Who the bloody hell
do you think you're talking to?

214
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:59,559
James Parker.
You are James Parker?

215
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,432
There's not another.

216
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:11,371
Like a trophy, you posed
with mother and child

217
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,308
'and then you were gone.'

218
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,012
Now, doesn't that make
you a first-class bastard?

219
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,981
'But I carry that
same picture.'

220
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,284
There has not been
a day in your life

221
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,520
that I have not carried
that same picture.

222
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,360
'She was so weak.'

223
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,298
I mean, your conception
almost killed her.

224
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,569
'Don't you understand that?'

225
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,146
If I had held her too long..

226
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,583
...if I had loved her too much.

227
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,358
So frail.

228
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,329
'So very fragile.'

229
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,436
God, how I loved you.

230
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,241
Her.

231
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:24,111
You loved her.

232
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,713
Yes. Her.

233
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,750
But you are her.

234
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,354
I am not.

235
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,090
How much do you hate me?

236
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,828
I think so very, very much.

237
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,634
[sighs]

238
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,615
Hate...is a very strong emotion.

239
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,817
'It can drain one.'

240
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,457
I know.

[melancholic music]

242
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,149
I wish you strength.

[music continues]

244
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,698
She didn't find me
a pretty sight.

245
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,067
And I did dress so
for the occasion.

[dogs whining]

247
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,471
Do you think I overdressed?

248
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,719
Goodnight, Jane Parker!

249
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,628
'Sleep well, Jane Parker.'

[lamb bleating]

252
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,548
Morning.
Am I disturbing you?

253
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,884
Not at all.

254
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,287
This should interest you.

255
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,623
Where is this?

256
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,125
That's the escarpment.
Somewhere up there.

257
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,528
Elephants go to die.

258
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,733
But that's a legend.
Do you believe it?

259
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,273
I've invested all that I have to
join your father on this trek.

260
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,475
'He's obsessed
with finding it.'

261
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,445
Look at those eyes.

262
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,714
He's the last of a breed.

'There's so many places in this
Earth still left to be explore''

'and so few men big enough
to go after them.'

265
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,656
Your father, I think
he's big enough.

266
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,692
Do you believe it's
strange risking your life

267
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,461
just to see what's
around the next corner?

268
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:31,464
That's the fascinating corner.

269
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,700
It always seems it'll be
more exciting there.

270
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,869
I know.

271
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,774
And it is just often
enough to keep you going.

272
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,177
Bye!

Good morning, James Parker.

278
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,594
I did sleep well, thank you.

279
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,231
I wished it so.

280
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,367
- I've been thinking.
- So have I.

281
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,536
I'm going with you.

282
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,604
Now, wait just one minute.

283
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,674
You'll go nowhere
unless I say so.

Where did you get it?

504
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:24,396
In a Cairo museum.
1000 years old.

505
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:27,566
An Egyptian expedition found

506
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:32,604
a graveyard full of ivory
near the great Inland Sea.

it's authentic?

My friend in
the museum thinks so.

But then, he didn't believe
in the seat of my pants either.

Shall we go?

- Well, then give them.
- Mr. Holt.

No photographer will tell me
how to run my expedition!

you can take one step

Mr. Holt, bloody mad.

541
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:38,630
The king shall dub me
knight of the realm

542
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:42,000
and the pope shall make me
a bloody saint.

- You go on, I'll catch up.
- Jane.

I'm going to take a bath.
You go on.

Alright then, we'll wait.

to that point over there.

I've got a funny feeling
I shall find my river.

And have a nice bath.

He's not an ape.

You're not going to touch him.
