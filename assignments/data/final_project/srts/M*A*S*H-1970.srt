1
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:51,636
# A cottage small is all I'm after

2
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,015
# Not one that's spacious and wide

3
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,727
# A house that brings you joy and laughter

4
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:03,773
# And the ones you love inside

5
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:07,944
# Some like the high road, I like the low road

6
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:11,656
# Free from the care and strife

7
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,992
# Sounds corny and seedy

8
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,952
# But, yes indeedy

9
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,621
# Give me

10
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,999
# The simple life

11
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:34,679
How about that? Weren't they wonderful?
Whaddaya say out there? How about that?

12
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,807
Let's hear it out there.
The lovely Miller Sisters.

13
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:41,603
See you later, girls.
Go to my dressing room and lie down.

14
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,857
They're wonderful, and fun to travel with.

15
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,570
Course, they keep us in separate cages.
Not that I can't be trusted.

16
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,781
I'm married to a woman who's a terrific sport.

17
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:56,284
She even looks like Joe DiMaggio.

18
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,955
Joe DiMaggio? Yeah, she's so ugly that...

19
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,209
Anybody out there,
or have we been captured?

20
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,547
But all kidding aside, I just wanna
say to all you guys and nurses

21
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:14,177
what a thrill it is to be in Korea with you.
We're all in this together, right?

22
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:24,145
That guy's first. Get this guy inside.
Give him a third of a grain of morphine.

23
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,523
- Quarter of a grain's enough.
- A third.

24
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:30,193
- Are you going over my head?
- Just through the hole in it.

25
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:34,405
- Now you hold it! And that's an order!
- Move! That's a threat!

26
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,868
- This is a gold oak leaf.
- I thought it was a little big for dandruff.

27
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:42,247
He's a big guy in severe pain.
He can handle a third of a grain.

28
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,208
If not, the anaesthesiologist
can support breathing.

29
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,545
- Go do what I said.
- Informed opinion says a quarter.

30
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:52,257
Informed opinion isn't on a stretcher
with a boot full of blood.

31
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,178
You've insulted me in the presence
of others for the last time.

32
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,598
Don't forget your hat, Frank.

33
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:08,439
This guy with laryngitis walks into the
doctor's office and sees a beautiful nurse.

34
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,483
She's built like a brick hospital.

35
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,403
Down, Charlie.

36
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:17,031
He walks in - the guy with laryngitis -
and says "Is the doctor in?"

37
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:20,243
And the nurse winks and says
"No, come on in."

38
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,832
Yeah, but really, though, I know how hard
you medics and nurses really work.

39
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,084
I really do. Although...

40
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:31,504
I wouldn't mind being paid
for playin' doctor, though.

41
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:35,383
- How am I doin'?
- Not too good.

42
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:39,220
His BP's low. His pulse is rapid.

43
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:42,473
Gimme another unit of blood.
I gotta go into his chest.

44
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:46,352
This could take a while.
I hope he doesn't have a late date.

45
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:49,939
Is it necessary to make bad jokes
while operating?

46
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:52,692
- Absolutely. Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

47
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,447
I've found it invaluable to make bad jokes
since my first autopsy,

48
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,867
when my colleagues put a kidney
under my cap.

49
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,203
- Sponge?
- Sponge.

50
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,626
- How am I doin' now?
- You're fine. He's in trouble.

51
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,219
Can I be of any help?

52
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:23,139
You can pray for me to become
a better doctor in the next five minutes.

53
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:25,183
Excuse me, Father.

54
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:30,522
# Why don't we do this more often

55
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:34,025
# Just what we're doing tonight

56
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:39,572
# Gee, but it's great to get together again

57
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:43,201
# Why does it only happen now and then?

58
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:47,330
# We ought to do this more often

59
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:52,627
# Don't you agree that I'm right?

60
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,838
# We make each other laugh

61
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:56,422
# We make each other sing

62
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:59,884
- Why aren't you at the switchboard?
- You asked me to come here.

63
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,220
They could phone about my wife any minute.

64
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,598
You just spoke to the hospital.
She's not in labour yet.

65
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:10,520
Don't argue! It's bad enough that she's
having a baby and I can't be there with her.

66
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,063
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:18,486
Well, at least you were there
for the important part.

68
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:27,245
# Just what we're doin' tonight

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,629
You know that joke about the guy who
saves his regiment? Shoots the cook?

70
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:39,591
No. How's it go?

71
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,471
- Kaplan, pass the salt.
- No.

72
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:46,890
I beg your pardon?

73
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:52,228
This dentist is not touching anything that
hasn't been checked by the bomb squad.

74
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:55,857
Taking rides in your chair again?
That makes you dizzy.

75
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,234
- Reach into my pocket.
- I hardly know you.

76
00:05:58,318 --> 00:06:00,612
My shirt pocket.

77
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:04,991
- My travel orders. I'm going home today.
- No kidding.

78
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:11,080
- Mind if I look, for drooling purposes?
- You unfold it. I could get a paper cut.

79
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:14,459
I'm not having any last-minute infections.

80
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:21,216
- Aren't you stretching things a bit?
- I haven't used the latrine in 18 hours.

81
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:26,095
- Now that's something I didn't have to know.
- In my pocket.

82
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,806
Can't be too careful.

83
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,101
Friend of mine got his orders,
broke his leg the next day.

84
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:36,439
Got it tangled in a nurse at his farewell party.

85
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:40,109
Well, you got a good point there,
Kaplan, and good luck.

86
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:44,948
# Again

87
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:51,829
# This couldn't happen again

88
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:59,170
# This is that once in a lifetime

89
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:06,469
# This is the thrill divine

90
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,557
You're not eating. Know something I don't?

91
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,687
- Something's troubling me.
- Think of me as your mother, Father.

92
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,024
- May I make a confession?
- As long as you don't use real names.

93
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:25,530
For some time now, I've been
comparing the disparity of our callings.

94
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,199
Doctor versus priest.

95
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:32,871
You fellows are always able
to see the end result of your work.

96
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:38,126
I mean, you know immediately
if you've been successful.

97
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,297
For me, the results are far less tangible.

98
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:46,926
Sometimes - most of the time -

99
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,430
I honestly don't know whether
I'm doing any good or not.

100
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,567
I used to have a professor
in med school who said:

101
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,820
"God cures the patients
but the doctor takes the fee."

102
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:07,906
Do you think that's true?

103
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:14,245
I'm able to do things in surgery
that I'm not really good enough to do.

104
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,919
Thanks, Hawkeye.

105
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:26,341
# But never, never again

106
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:32,388
# Never again

107
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:39,938
- Gimme some suction.
- Yes, Doctor.

108
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,607
Feels like someone used
my eyeballs for a teabag.

109
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,609
Nurse!

110
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,738
Trapper, you better not be much longer.

111
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,241
- Clamp?
- Clamp. Thanks.

112
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:55,495
OK, come on. Stay with us, will ya?

113
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:40,248
Hello? Hello, uh, Bloomington, Illinois?

114
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,876
- General Hospital?
- You got them?

115
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,046
- I'm calling about Mrs Henry Blake.
- Maternity.

116
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,050
Right. She's pregnant.
You know, with a baby.

117
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:55,263
Yeah. OK, OK. They're ringing her room.

118
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:59,601
Boy, can you imagine?
I am becoming a father for the third time.

119
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:01,519
Yes, sir.

120
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:04,731
They know what causes that now.

121
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:06,941
- What are they doing?
- Hello? Yes?

122
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:10,195
- I'm still holding, operator.
- Why am I so nervous?

123
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,448
For gosh sakes, she's got
the best obstetrician in town.

124
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:17,035
Marv Handleman. He could
deliver a baby with his eyes shut.

125
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,412
That's the only way I'd do it, sir.

126
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:22,040
Yes? What?

127
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,459
Are you sure?

128
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,837
Sir? She's not there any more.

129
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:32,133
- She's not there any more?
- We'll get right back to ya.

130
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:35,094
- I just...
- It's all right. They sent her home.

131
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,847
She had a false labour.

132
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:41,184
- She had a what?
- A false labour?

133
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:44,562
- Radar?
- Steady, sir.

134
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:47,440
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Steady, sir.

135
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:49,192
Just sit.

136
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:53,029
OK. Everything's gonna be fine.

137
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:57,116
Would you believe that I've got
a craving for dill pickles?

138
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:06,292
That's the last of the shrapnel.

139
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:10,171
- Close him fast.
- Gimme some 3-0 silk.

140
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:13,633
- I've lost the pulse.
- I'm gonna massage the heart.

141
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,927
Get some adrenaline ready.

142
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:21,182
- Hang on, dammit!
- Still no pulse.

143
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:24,310
- Adrenaline! Let's go!
- It's going again.

144
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:28,231
But it's irregular.

145
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:31,860
Oh, God...

146
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:24,162
Yes, operator, go ahead, I can hear you.

147
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:29,334
- Seven pounds, two ounces, 21 inches?
- What's, uh, seven pounds, two ounces?

148
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,753
Your son, sir.

149
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,048
My son?

150
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:38,676
- My wife's had a boy?
- Well, it isn't a girl-son, sir.

151
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,722
Your wife is doing just fine.
It's the hospital.

152
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,225
The hospital?

153
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:49,103
Listen, tell Mildred - Mrs Blake -

154
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:52,190
that her husband, Henry,
loves her very much.

155
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,526
- She didn't hear your name.
- What?

156
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:59,072
Henry. H as in... Never mind,
she knows my name.

157
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,200
Just tell her that I love her,
and that I'll call her

158
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,869
and that all my labour pains have stopped.

159
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:07,038
Goodbye.

160
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,718
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thanks, Radar.

161
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:23,221
A son. A boy.

162
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:32,272
So this woman gets up real close
to the guy in the sailor suit and she says:

163
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:36,484
- "So what kind of doctor are you?"
- Guy says "Me? I'm a naval doctor."

164
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:40,738
And she says "Boy, when you
specialise, you really specialise!"

165
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:46,619
Ohh, so it's that kind of a crowd, huh? You
really go for the sophisticated stuff, huh?

166
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:40,965
# I had the craziest dream

167
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:46,971
# Last night, yes, I did

168
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:53,603
# I never dreamt it could be

169
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:57,023
# Yet there you were

170
00:14:57,106 --> 00:15:00,693
# In love with me

171
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:06,741
# I found your lips close to mine
so I kissed you

172
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:10,578
# And you didn't mind it at all

173
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:12,789
# Not at all

174
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:18,419
- You've never had any children, have you?
- Being single, it never seemed a wise move.

175
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,132
It's too bad. It's a great feeling.

176
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:28,054
Then why do you sound
like a hit-and-run victim?

177
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:32,684
Me? I couldn't be happier.

178
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:37,689
There's no disgrace in being depressed
because you can't be with your new baby.

179
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:41,818
Yeah, inasmuch as no umbilical cord
reaches 20,000 miles.

180
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,993
Here's to your new son, Henry.

181
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:51,661
Yeah.

182
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,454
Yeah.

183
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:57,750
But let's hope I meet him before
he gets drafted and sent over here.

184
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:04,716
# Say it and make my craziest dream

185
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:11,055
# Come true

186
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:17,228
Let's hear it for the girls!

187
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:23,943
How about this band? They're gonna do
a number, but first I'll tell you about Charlie.

188
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:30,617
Charlie served in World War II.
Remember it? It was in all the papers.

189
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,746
What'd he say?

190
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:37,874
Uh... I didn't really hear.

191
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:40,960
Charlie's in a hospital with a sheet over him.

192
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:44,797
He pulls it down and sees himself
being wheeled away on a stretcher.

193
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:48,676
He asks the orderly "Where we goin'?"
The orderly says "To be buried."

194
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,305
He says "I'm not dead." Orderly says
"Wanna make a fool outta the doctor?"

195
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,683
It doesn't look good, Trapper.

196
00:16:55,767 --> 00:17:00,396
- You did your best.
- Too bad it was so lousy.

197
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,651
What's goin' on?
There's a rumour you three eloped.

198
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:08,154
I started out to be an architect.
Couldn't handle the math.

199
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:12,784
- Why don't you get some rest?
- Here, Father. We need some cross action.

200
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,642
The blood pressure is still low, but it's better.

201
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,521
Hang another unit of blood.

202
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:45,984
What was that about not
being sure you did good?

203
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:49,153
It's not supposed to work that way, you know.

204
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:01,958
<i>Go hit the sack or I'll report you
to the doctors and the architects.</i>

205
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:06,296
I'll take care of him. Come on.

206
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,891
You know something?
Those two could wind up...

207
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:20,059
Uh, yes?

208
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,022
Rolling Easter eggs.

209
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:15,615
Captain Kaplan? Pile in.

210
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:19,327
Move over. You think I'm putting
my life in your hands?

211
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,788
- What are you - 19?
- I'm 18, sir.

212
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,998
My feet have corns older than you.

213
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,586
What is that? A disinfectant?

214
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,673
Who knows where this kid's
hands have been?

215
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:35,593
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Please, Nurse, no offence...

216
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:39,138
<i>I'm a dentist. I know.
The mouth is a playground for germs.</i>

217
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:42,725
If the tongue weren't attached,
it'd jump out in a minute.

218
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:47,146
- Is it possible to bless a jeep, Father?
- Consider it done.

219
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,524
We better go. You have a plane to catch.

220
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:53,736
Don't remind me. As we're talking,
the propeller's getting older.

221
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,322
Well, goodbye, everybody.

222
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:02,912
- Lucky man.
- Certainly is.

223
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:15,216
I knew it! Did I know it?
Did I know... did I say it?

224
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,845
I said it from the very beginning.
Jinxed. Look at that.

225
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:22,223
Anybody can step on the gas
instead of the brake.

226
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:24,517
- How's the driver?
- The kid's OK.

227
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,062
Figures! I'm going home, I'm in pieces!

228
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:30,690
He's staying here, he didn't bust a pimple.

229
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:34,986
You know how I'm getting home
when the time comes? I'm walking!

230
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:42,452
You're not leaving me alone!

231
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:47,707
- Would you like a surprise, sir?
- Yes, I would.

232
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,878
I'd like to be stolen by Gypsies
and taken to their camp in Illinois.

233
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,379
Close your eyes.

234
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:57,425
Radar, this is not a good day
for playing games.

235
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,512
Please?

236
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:05,308
Yeah.

237
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:07,352
OK, now, no peeking now.

238
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:08,895
Yeah.

239
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:16,694
- Well?
- Just a minute.

240
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:22,075
- Oh, boy.
- I'm coming.

241
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:23,284
Mm-hmm.

242
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,873
- Can I open my eyes yet?
- Not yet.

243
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:34,462
Hold out your hands.

244
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,967
OK, open 'em.

245
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:46,266
Oh... oh, don't cry.

246
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,562
Radar, where did this baby come from?

247
00:21:57,443 --> 00:22:00,196
You're not in any kind of trouble, are you?

248
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,034
Oh, no, no, sir. His mother
works in the camp laundry.

249
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:23,178
I just thought, since you couldn't
get to see your own son...

250
00:22:31,352 --> 00:22:33,438
He's, uh, he's a beautiful boy.

251
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:43,239
- Can she speak English, Radar?
- Uh, no, sir.

252
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,702
But it's nice you could smile in Korean.

253
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:56,044
- Well, I guess we'd better get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,343
Sir?

255
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:06,554
In a minute.

256
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:11,643
# You make me feel so young

257
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:15,897
# You make me feel there
are songs to be sung

258
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,444
# Bells to be rung and a wonderful
fling to be flung

259
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:25,114
# And even when I'm old and grey

260
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:29,661
# I'm gonna feel the way I feel today

261
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:34,040
# Cos you make me feel so

262
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:37,627
# You make me feel so

263
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,714
# You make me feel so young

264
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:44,008
# So young

265
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:59,482
Just wait a second.

266
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:25,383
It's been a ball, an honour,
and a privilege meeting with you like this.

267
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:29,512
It's time to go because they're winding up
the rubber band on the airplane.

268
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:33,766
On behalf of the Miller Sisters, let's hear it!

269
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,520
Charlie Keller and his Clan of Lunatics.

270
00:24:37,604 --> 00:24:41,608
And me, yes sirree, in person, Jackie Flash,

271
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:44,694
saying we'll be back
to see you again real soon.

272
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:48,031
Same time, same place, same war.

273
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:49,949
So long now, and God bless ya.

274
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:52,452
Yes, sir, let's hear it out there.
