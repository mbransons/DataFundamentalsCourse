00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,272
# "Sayonara"

00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:44,199

00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:19,800
# "Sayonara"

# "Japanese goodbye"

6
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,510
Just like a bird!

7
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:18,237
How many did you get, sir?

8
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:21,950
- Hey, he got two more!
- Old Gruver got two more!

9
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:24,118
Nice going there, sir.

10
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:38,008
Let’s try the other lung.

11
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,177
Breathe.

12
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,681
- Breathe.
- Hi, Padre.

13
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,686
- Two more MiGs today, I hear, Lloyd.
- Yeah.

14
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,272
That’s it. You can put it on.

15
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,571
- Well, Ace, you’ve had it.
- Say what?

16
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,824
You’re through flying for a while, anyway.

17
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,036
Oh, no. Nothing wrong with me
a little bottle of beer isn’t gonna fix up.

18
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,540
Give him a bottle of beer
and send him back up.

19
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:13,880
- Don’t get yourself excited here.
- Don’t get pale. I was just giving you a rib.

20
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,716
But you could use some sleep.

21
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:20,178
Yeah, I could use
a little nice Korean sleep.

22
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,807
Better than that. You’re going to Japan.

23
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:29,062
- I’m going to Japan? What for?
- Why not?

24
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:32,941
Wouldn’t you like to tangle with
one of those beautiful Japanese dolls?

25
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:37,321
If it’s your prescription, Doc,
I’ll certainly work at it best I can.

26
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:41,826
You’re going to Kobe.
Kelly has your orders.

27
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:44,913
What in the world am I gonna do in Kobe?

28
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:49,792
It’s a special request
of General Webster himself.

29
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,882
Well, then, this has all been prearranged?

30
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:57,635
Prearranged? Demanded.

31
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,890
Why shouldn’t a three-star general
look out for a four-star general’s son?

32
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:05,809
Don’t get on my back.
I ain’t buckin’ for favours.

33
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:08,103
I know you haven’t. I was just kidding.

34
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,107
- See you, Doc. Thanks.
- Can I have a word, Gruver?

35
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:15,695
Yeah. I’ll bet you I know what the word is.
K- e-l-l-y. Is that true or false?

36
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,907
He’s got permission to go back
and marry that Japanese girl.

37
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:22,035
I told him - he can’t take her
back to the States.

38
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,704
I explained the law in detail myself.

39
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:27,542
But there’s no law
which says he can’t marry her,

40
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,503
and he’s appealed to his congressman.

41
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:34,215
- His congressman?
- I wish you’d talk to him.

42
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,511
After all, he is one of your men, and you’re
the only human being he looks up to.

43
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:43,517
Listen, I’m gonna tell you something.
That boy don’t look up to anybody.

44
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:48,814
He has been promoted four times
and busted right back again.

45
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,943
Yeah, my congressman.
Shocking, ain’t it, Major?

46
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,530
Chaplain says don’t marry the girl.
Colonel says don’t marry the girl.

47
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,700
You say don’t marry the girl.

48
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:03,204
Congressman says “You marry
that girl, Kelly.” What can I do?

49
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,125
I’ll tell you what you can do, boy.
You can go and marry your congressman.

50
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,294
You’d be better off.

51
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,547
Give me coffee.

52
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,717
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,472
I hear you bagged two more today, Major.

54
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,475
- How was it up there?
- Splendid.

55
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,775
What’s the matter? What happened?

56
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:37,324
There was a guy with a face
in one of those planes today.

57
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,288
There was a guy with a face
in all the other seven you shot down.

58
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:45,166
Yeah.

59
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,252
That’s exactly
what I’ve been thinking about.

60
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:51,088
Well, you can stop thinking.

61
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:54,926
You got a very well-written contract here.

62
00:06:55,885 --> 00:07:00,140
General Webster’s had you assigned
to the inter-service aviation board,

63
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:03,227
which means you got
practically nothing to do.

64
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:09,775
Except, of course, marry the general’s
daughter who arrives in Kobe tomorrow.

65
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,152
- You mean Eileen...?
- That’s right.

66
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:15,823
- General’s wife and daughter both.
- Don’t fool me now.

67
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:21,246
I’m not fooling. You’re not supposed
to know anything about it. Big surprise.

68
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:23,623
Eileen’s coming to Kobe.

69
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:28,378
Yeah. General Webster arranges it
for you to marry his daughter,

70
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:32,091
my congressman arranges it
for me to marry my girl.

71
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:35,845
Generals for the officers,
congressmen for the peasants.

72
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,431
Listen, I’m glad you brought that up, boy.

73
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:43,727
I think there’s a little bit of difference
that we oughta talk about.

74
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:47,106
- What do you mean?
- Well, now listen.

75
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:50,318
I never did show you
a picture of my girl, did I, Kelly?

76
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:51,820
No.

77
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:55,365
Well, I’m gonna show you
a picture of a girl.

78
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,076
It happens to be my girl,
but she’s American.

79
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:01,663
And I want you to take
a long, long look at her,

80
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:06,127
because I believe that maybe you forgot
what an American girl looks like.

81
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:11,883
And this girl I’m gonna show to you
is first of all an American girl,

82
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:16,512
a girl with fine character,
a girl with good background,

83
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:19,600
good education, good family, good blood.

84
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:24,855
I’ve known this girl since I was about
that high. Families are very close.

85
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,650
I’ve been engaged to this girl
for a long time, Kelly.

86
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,987
Now, she’s a girl of unusual character.

87
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,574
I’d like you to take a look at her,
a close look,

88
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:39,037
and tell me what you think
and what your feeling is.

89
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,337
- Kind of beat up, ain’t she?
- I beg your pardon?

90
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:51,926
No. The beat-up one’s
her mother, you idiot.

91
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,094
Here’s Eileen.

92
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,972
- Now, now...
- Hey.

93
00:08:57,097 --> 00:09:00,726
" She sure does something wicked
to a bathing suit.

94
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:07,108
She has an enormous capacity
to fulfill a bathing suit. That’s enough.

95
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,277
I’m just showing it to you.

96
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:12,781
But all kidding aside,
the reason I wanna show you this girl...

97
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:15,408
You ever seen Katsumi?

98
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,994
- Where’s that?
- It’s not a “where’s that?”

99
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:21,958
- It’s the girl I’m marrying.
- Oh. Well, no.

100
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,418
I don’t know Japanese names.

101
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,004
That’s all right. Forget it.

102
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:33,094
- Well?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:36,556
Looks like a bright girl.

104
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:41,645
- She’s a whole lot brighter than me.
- That ain’t too hard to do, you know.

105
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,399
Listen, Kelly, I wanna say
something seriously to you.

106
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:48,735
Aren’t you taking a risk
in marrying this Japanese girl?

107
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:51,196
Risks don’t scare me any.

108
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:54,492
The army and the air force
and the State Department

109
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:57,078
have ganged up
to keep me from getting married.

110
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:59,789
Hold on. What do you mean, ganged up?

111
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:02,584
Here, look at these pamphlets.

112
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:05,712
”Think it over, Americans.”

113
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:10,134
”Things you are required to know and do
before marrying Orientals.”

114
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,597
Here’s another piece of garbage.
”But will your family accept her?”

115
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:17,850
- Will they, Kelly?
- I ain’t got any family.

116
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:21,478
I haven’t got anything
against this girl of yours.

117
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:26,109
I haven’t got anything against
the Japanese any more. Not really.

118
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:29,696
But, you know, when...

119
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:34,868
I just don’t understand
how a normal, average American...

120
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:38,246
Let’s put it this way.

121
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,293
I think even your friends are gonna
put you down if you marry this girl.

122
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:47,381
If the friends I got are that kind, they won’t
be friends of mine much longer.

123
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:52,637
Major, I’m gonna marry my girl if I have to
give up my American citizenship to do it.

124
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:56,350
Kelly, you stupid, ignorant slob.

125
00:10:56,475 --> 00:11:00,896
Go ahead and marry this slant-eyed runt
if you want to. It’ll serve you right.

126
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:03,857
Wait a minute, Major.
Don’t talk to me that way!

127
00:11:03,982 --> 00:11:07,528
I won’t take that
from you or anybody else.

128
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,409
I’m sorry, Kelly.

129
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,954
I’m sorry.

130
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:21,084
I’m just blowing my stack a little today.

131
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,212
But, boy, I mean it. I...

132
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:31,011
I wanna tell you, when you tell me
that you’re gonna give up your citizenship

133
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:34,098
for a girl, any girl,

134
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:36,392
I think you’re nuts.

135
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:41,981
- I think you’re crazy.
- I am crazy. I’m in love crazy.

136
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:46,027
I think you’re gonna cut your throat
and I’d just hate to see you do it.

137
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:49,030
And I mean that with all sincerity.

138
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:55,954
Maybe that’s because you don’t feel
as strong about your girl as I do mine.

139
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:00,710
There’s your orders, Major.

140
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,879
See you on the plane.

141
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,176
OK.

142
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,978
Kelly.

143
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:27,613
We’re coming in, Major.
There’s the Inland Sea.

144
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:32,285
Beautiful, ain’t it?
Sure is nice scenery out there.

145
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,456
That’s Kobe over there.
See it, with all the docks?

146
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:40,293
What you’re looking at, Major,
really is three cities all run together.

147
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:43,129
There’s Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto.

148
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:46,342
- They got kabuki there.
- What’s kabuki?

149
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:50,679
Never heard of kabuki theatre?
All men, no dames.

150
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:54,433
- That’s gonna be dull, ain’t it?
- I don’t know.

151
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:58,812
If it’s all dames you want,
I think we’re gonna get there in about...

152
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:01,065
Yep. Look down there.

153
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:05,695
See that little park over there with
the lakes around it? That’s Matsubayashi.

154
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,448
- Where?
- Right down in there. See it?

155
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,493
The Matsubayashi girls
are the most famous in Japan.

156
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:14,704
They sing, they dance,
they act all the parts. No men.

157
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:17,875
Katsumi knows all the actresses.
She’s a movie fan.

158
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,256
You’re just blowin’ your top about
seeing Katsumi, aren’t you? Carryin’ on...

159
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,424
She’s my girl, Major.

160
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,359
- Well, GG, good to see you.
- So long, Lloyd.

161
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:46,071
- Lots of luck to you.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

162
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:49,450
Lloyd! Lloyd! Here we are.

163
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,244
Lloyd!

164
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:54,247
- Hey, there!
- Don’t forget to act surprised.

165
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:57,667
Yeah, hi there! Hot dog!

166
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:00,295
Won’t he be surprised!

167
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,463
- Major?
- Yeah?

168
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:06,552
How about being my best man?

169
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:13,934
Listen, Kelly, I told you
that I’m against this marriage.

170
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:18,063
It would mean a lot to me.
What do you say, Major?

171
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,155
OK.

172
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,117
Consul’s office. 10 o’clock, Saturday.

173
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,918
Well, come on, honey. Hurry up.

174
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,091
Well, now. Come here, you!

175
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,385
Hi!

176
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,597
Certainly good to see you.
Hi, sir. Nice to see you.

177
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,853
I said “There’s General Webster
but who is that good-looking woman?”

178
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:59,900
- Tell me about Eileen. How is she?
- She finds Tulsa terribly dull without you.

179
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,861
Well, I wish she could have come along.

180
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,281
Lloyd, you couldn’t expect us
to bring her out here.

181
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:10,370
You’re registered at the hotel for the first
few nights but stationed here after that.

182
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:13,081
- I see.
- Let’s go. You get in first.

183
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:16,626
- You go ahead, Mrs. Webster.
- No, you get in first.

184
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,379
- Go on, get in.
- No, ladies first.

185
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,884
Hi, Lloyd.

186
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:27,513
You devil.

187
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:29,682
Come here.

188
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:38,525
I’m glad to see you, darling.

189
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:47,909
I forgot what an ugly girl you got here.

190
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,453
She’s not ugly. She’s a beautiful girl.

191
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,456
She’s the ugliest girl I ever saw.

192
00:15:55,793 --> 00:16:00,715
And that dress is terrible.
It just goes in and out. That’s awful.

193
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,510
It’s meant to go in and out. I go in and out.

194
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:07,597
Well, we’ll talk about that later.

195
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:21,612
Send Major Gruver’s luggage
up to his room, will you?

196
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:23,572
That’s beautiful, isn’t it?

197
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:27,410
- Are there any rules against it?
- No, but it’s understood...

198
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:30,538
I thought the club would be honored.

199
00:16:30,663 --> 00:16:33,833
Please, Mike, let’s go.

200
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:37,462
- What’s she doing here?
- Mother!

201
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:42,801
- Isn’t she with that young officer?
- Kobe’s a recreation centre.

202
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:45,262
- That’s right.
- It degrades the uniform.

203
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,390
- It’s out-and-out fraternization.
- She’s beautiful.

204
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:49,975
All the more reason.

205
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,144
Mark?

206
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,896
Colonel Crawford.

207
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:58,652
- Let’s get outta this clip joint.
- Just a minute, Captain Bailey.

208
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:03,156
- What’s the trouble?
- I didn’t mean to bother you with this.

209
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:06,409
Captain Bailey here is wanting
to take her into the club.

210
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:13,042
General Webster, sir, this young lady
is one of Japan’s most famous dancers.

211
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,586
She’s no ordinary...

212
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,755
Yes, I understand.

213
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:23,553
Even so, don’t you realize
this club is only for American personnel?

214
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:29,059
Now, we’ve been pretty easy
about fraternization in this area,

215
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:31,728
even though there are
strict orders against it.

216
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:37,526
But when an officer
who should be an example...

217
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:39,903
Am I to understand, sir,
that you personally

218
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:43,574
refuse to allow me
to take this young lady into the club?

219
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:50,498
I understand how you feel, Captain,
and I’m very embarrassed, but I’m sorry.

220
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:53,209
- Thank you.
- Thank you, "sir."

221
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:57,380
Don’t you know there’s such a thing
as insolence through manner?

222
00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:59,550
Thank you, "sir."

223
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:09,894
Come on in, boys. Eileen has to change.

224
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,980
- Eileen’s taking you to the kabuki tonight.
- Good.

225
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:16,693
We met Mr. Nakamura, the head actor,
and he invited her to come.

226
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:21,448
Isn’t that where there’s no dames
and the men play all the women’s parts?

227
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:24,868
That’s right, the way they do at Princeton.
Come on, Mark.

228
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:27,412
It’s gonna be fun. Come on, baby.

229
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:58,237
Did you bring your lunch?

230
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,415
”Miss Eileen Webster.” Ah!

231
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:52,461
- Who’s fightin’ her?
- That’s Nakamura.

232
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:57,425
- He’s the one I met. He’s very famous.
- Is that Nakamura?

233
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:02,054
It’s about a lady who turns into a lion.

234
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:07,352
She gonna turn into a lion right here?
I wanna see that.

235
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,086
I love you, Lloyd. I love you terribly.

236
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:36,007
I always have and I guess I always will.

237
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,177
I love you, honey.

238
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:41,722
Awful glad you’re here, too.

239
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:54,444
Everybody acting
like nobody ever kissed in the world.

240
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:37,489
She wouldn’t be half so ugly if she didn’t
stick her face in that flour barrel.

241
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:39,826
She?

242
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:41,995
Well, whatever.

243
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:44,998
He had me.

244
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:57,052
He’s a male actress. It says here
they’ve been trained since childhood

245
00:21:57,177 --> 00:22:00,180
to have the grace of a woman
and yet the power of a man.

246
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:01,432
Oh, my word.

247
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:06,228
My lord! That’s my father!

248
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:37,637
Is he man enough now for you, Lloyd?

249
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:40,806
Is that the same fellow?

250
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:42,768
Uh-huh.

251
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:03,414
It’s all right.

252
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:16,053
I am sure it must be very difficult

253
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:19,974
to enjoy theatre
so different from your own.

254
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,727
- We found it fascinating.
- I am glad.

255
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:27,690
Kabuki’s very old, isn’t it?

256
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:30,235
Some 300 years.

257
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,406
I find myself becoming intrigued
by everything in Japan.

258
00:23:34,531 --> 00:23:40,620
I should be happy to help you know
my country better, if at any time I can.

259
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,294
You did not enjoy the evening so much,
I fear, Major Gruver.

260
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:49,589
Oh, yeah. I thought it was a fine play.

261
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:56,512
I thought maybe you could use a Marilyn
Monroe here and there, you know, to...

262
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:04,896
Unfortunately, Miss Monroes were barred
from kabuki in the 17th century.

263
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:10,027
I didn’t mean to sound corny.
I just didn’t know what to say about it.

264
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:12,571
Please, do not apologize.

265
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:17,702
I am great admirer of Miss Monroe myself.

266
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:21,205
That’s two of us. That’s you and me, boy.

267
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,049
No, don’t do it to me. It’s real good.
Thank you very much. Why not?

268
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:34,720
- Let’s go and see the garden.
- OK, you go on. I’ll take this.

269
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,975
That’s fine, fine cooking. Very good.

270
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:50,403
Here you are, honey.

271
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:53,615
- No, thank you.
- Don’t care for any?

272
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:57,953
- Sit down, darling.
- You look awful pretty.

273
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,961
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking
with you away, Lloyd.

274
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,047
- Answer me one thing.
- What’s that, honey?

275
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,633
Why aren’t we married now?

276
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,513
- Isn’t that a silly question?
- No, not really.

277
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:18,349
You do a lot of wondering in Tulsa.

278
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:22,854
Well, I suppose the Korean War
might have a little something to do with it.

279
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,566
Wasn’t Korea maybe convenient, Lloyd?

280
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,818
Convenient?

281
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:34,449
What I really mean is... do I mean
everything to you as you do to me?

282
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,202
Course you do, honey.

283
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,998
I went to visit your mother
before I came here, there in Richmond.

284
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:40,999
My mother?

285
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:44,294
I was appalled at the loneliness
in which she lives,

286
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,754
and the way your father’s content to go off

287
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,299
and leave her walled up
in a circle of friends

288
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:52,344
while he plunges off to the war.

289
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:56,682
Hold on a second. You’ve got to
remember my father’s a general, honey.

290
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,059
Besides, my mother
wants to live that way.

291
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,770
- Don’t be ridiculous.
- Don’t tell me that.

292
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:07,402
No woman wants to live any way except
body and soul with the man she loves.

293
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:10,530
You’ll never tuck me away
in some little town.

294
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:14,534
Become the greatest general
in air-force history, but love me too.

295
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:17,621
But do I love you, baby. I do.

296
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:26,255
Well, I guess all I’m trying to say is that -
and I really mean this, Lloyd -

297
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,884
if what you want
is a family like our fathers have

298
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:32,887
and promotion in the air force

299
00:26:33,012 --> 00:26:37,016
and position in society
like our mothers have,

300
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:43,982
and you marry me because I’m pretty and
smart and have guts and know the ropes...

301
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:50,447
then I don’t think
you want to marry me, Lloyd.

302
00:26:50,572 --> 00:26:54,577
I’m sorry.
I guess I’ve been thinking too much.

303
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,041
Yeah, I think you have
been thinking too much.

304
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,894
Now...

305
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:21,146
Now quit it.

306
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:25,485
OK. I don’t know.
Maybe things’ll turn out after all.

307
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,738
What do you mean, maybe?
Sure, it’s gonna turn out.

308
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:33,368
It’s just all that nonsense you talk about
every time we get together.

309
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:37,289
Nonsense? I hadn’t realized
it was nonsense.

310
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:40,167
Course it is, honey. It’s all very simple.

311
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:42,169
Now, look here.

312
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:47,383
I want a wife and a family.
I want a home in America.

313
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:52,680
And every time I think of a home like that,
I think about it with a woman like you.

314
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:55,266
A girl with a good army
background like my own...

315
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:59,938
What do you mean, a girl like me?
I’m not a type. I’m me.

316
00:28:00,063 --> 00:28:03,358
Lloyd, it’s me you’ve got to love.

317
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:09,698
Haven’t you ever felt like grabbing me and
hauling me off to a shack somewhere?

318
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:12,869
You know better than that.
Of course I have.

319
00:28:12,994 --> 00:28:16,497
- Then what’s holding you back?
- Eileen, are you ever gonna grow up?

320
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:19,792
There’s a right time
and a wrong time to do things.

321
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:24,547
You have responsibilities to other people.
You have a position to fulfill.

322
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:28,636
- You’re not alone in this world.
- You defend yourself like a fort.

323
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:33,724
No matter how I defend myself, you gotta
understand I am not in a position

324
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:38,520
to be hauling my fiancée away
to a shack somewhere like an alley cat.

325
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:40,814
I wasn’t brought up that way.

326
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,485
You’re going to do everything
expected of you?

327
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,862
I’m certainly gonna try.

328
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:49,157
I don’t expect you to marry me
just because it’s expected of you.

329
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:52,869
Sometimes I look at you
and I don’t understand you.

330
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:59,001
I think sometimes I don’t even know
who you are or what you’re all about.

331
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,755
Maybe you don’t. Maybe you never will.

332
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:21,942
- …so long as you both shall live?
- I will.

333
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,945
Katsumi, wilt though have this man
to thy wedded husband,

334
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,657
to live together after God’s ordinance
in the holy state of matrimony,

335
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:32,578
love him, comfort him, honor
and keep him, in sickness and in health,

336
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:39,627
and forsaking all others keep thee only
unto him, so long as you both shall live?

337
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,007
- She will.
- She will.

338
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:49,680
If any man can show just cause why
they may not be lawfully joined together,

339
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:53,767
let him now speak
or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.

340
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:03,570
Do you realize
you waive all your legal rights?

341
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:05,780
I signed all the papers, didn’t I?

342
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:09,993
You’ll have to look after your wife on
your own. The air force is not responsible.

343
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:13,622
Yeah, I know. Romantic, ain’t it, Major?

344
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:19,003
Will you finish this ugly deed
and get it over?

345
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:21,505
I pronounce you man and wife.
Sign over there.

346
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:23,674
Just a minute.

347
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:46,615
That’s it, Mrs. Kelly. Just you and me now.

348
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:00,463
Where do we sign?

349
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:03,091
May as well witness this now, Major.

350
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:04,927
Yeah, all right.

351
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:09,682
It was a great honor meeting you,
Major Gruver.

352
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:11,600
Thank you.

353
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:17,314
Tell me, Consul, are all these ceremonies
conducted like this?

354
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:21,486
Well, we do our best
to prevent as many as possible.

355
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:26,574
We make the paperwork so difficult
that a good many of them lose steam.

356
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,831
About how many GIs
have gone through this ceremony?

357
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:37,628
About... 10,000.

358
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:42,133
10,000? Well, then,
you let a few slip by you, didn’t you?

359
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:44,302
A few, yes.

360
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:48,180
How’s your girl, Major?

361
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:51,100
Eileen? I haven’t seen her
in a couple of days.

362
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:53,979
I’ve been moving in,
getting my things arranged.

363
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:59,401
She’s been hightailing it
with the brass, socializing.

364
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:03,572
Major, ain’t you gonna kiss the bride?

365
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:07,952
Sure, I’m gonna kiss the bride.

366
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:11,122
Yeah. Sure.

367
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:16,961
Listen, I want you to take good care
of this boy, you hear?

368
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:23,594
Here’s your ticket, honey. Don’t forget it.

369
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,680
OK, boy.

370
00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:31,977
Thanks, Major. Took a lot of guts
for you to come here today.

371
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:33,103
Quit.

372
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:38,275
If you ever need a job done that you West
Point guys ain’t allowed to do yourselves,

373
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:39,778
I’m your man.

374
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:44,115
- I’m gonna call on you.
- Come on, let’s get a belt.

375
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,535
- How are you, Lloyd?
- Fine, just fine.

376
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:50,330
- That’s a pretty dress you got on.
- Thanks.

377
00:32:50,455 --> 00:32:52,749
Lloyd, sit down, son.

378
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:54,919
All righty.

379
00:32:57,546 --> 00:33:02,677
- Thank you for coming over so promptly.
- That’s all right. I was just darning socks.

380
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:05,471
Lloyd...

381
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:11,478
I don’t exactly know how to put this.
It’s a little embarrassing. For me, that is.

382
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:14,856
You were a witness
at a marriage yesterday between...

383
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:18,318
one of your men and a Japanese girl.

384
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:22,906
Yeah, one of the men
from my outfit in Korea.

385
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:29,122
You realize, of course, there’s an army
policy to discourage all such marriages.

386
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:35,169
I think they couldn’t have been
discouraged. They’re very much in love.

387
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:41,050
I dare say. However, you personally
seemed to sanction the marriage...

388
00:33:41,176 --> 00:33:44,638
No, I didn’t mean
to give that impression at all.

389
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:48,434
I didn’t sanction it.
I tried to talk him out of it before.

390
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,563
But, Lloyd, darling,
you did act as his witness.

391
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:55,774
Well, as long as
it was gonna be inevitable,

392
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:58,820
I thought I might as well
try to make it pleasant.

393
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:01,281
Don’t you see the position
that puts me in?

394
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,242
Since I’m the area commander here...

395
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:09,372
You didn’t do anything to encourage
this marriage, sir. I did all this on my own.

396
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:13,461
What do you mean?
On your own, Lloyd, dear?

397
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:18,758
Everything you do reflects on the general.
After all, he is Eileen’s father.

398
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:21,510
This places me
in a position of incompetence

399
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:26,057
when it comes to doing anything
to help my own men.

400
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:30,854
Let’s stop beating around the bush.
What’s wrong between you and Eileen?

401
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:34,775
You haven’t been to see her
for several days.

402
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:43,659
Well... you talked about
being embarrassed, sir, before.

403
00:34:43,784 --> 00:34:46,162
I’m embarrassed too.

404
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:50,083
- What about?
- About my whole situation here.

405
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:54,087
I’m a pilot, sir. I was doing a job in Korea.
An unfinished job.

406
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:56,297
I’m pulled off that job and sent here

407
00:34:56,422 --> 00:35:00,719
and plonked down at a desk
at this inter-service whatever it is.

408
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:04,264
As far as I can see,
there’s absolutely nothing to do.

409
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,600
All so’s I can be with Eileen.

410
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:10,938
There’s nothing dishonest about it.
That is, if you plan to get married.

411
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:16,152
- I think I know how Lloyd feels.
- Do you plan to get married or not?

412
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:20,198
- Really, dear.
- I’m her mother. I want to know.

413
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:28,290
Well, Mrs. Webster, as of the moment,
Eileen isn’t too sure about it and I...

414
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:34,755
We know, Lloyd, dear. There’s evidently
been some slight strain between you two,

415
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,717
but don’t let it become too important.

416
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:42,680
This is Sunday night. Why don’t you
call her up later and ask her out to dinner?

417
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:44,015
Well...

418
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,686
Mother, I found the dearest little shop...

419
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:50,814
- Hi, Lloyd.
- Hello, Eileen.

420
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,400
Lloyd just came in to see you.

421
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:55,611
Oh?

422
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,780
Listen...

423
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:02,869
I thought... It’s Sunday night
and I thought maybe

424
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:09,042
you and I can go out and catch a movie
or something, if you feel like it.

425
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,879
I’m sorry, Lloyd. I’m having dinner
with some friends tonight.

426
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,007
Well, what about tomorrow?

427
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,386
That’s booked too, I’m afraid.

428
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:27,227
Well, it looks as though
I’m holding pretty tough cards.

429
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:31,649
What about next week?

430
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,111
Of course, Lloyd. Call me.

431
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:40,033
OK.

432
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,788
Mrs. Webster, General.

433
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,957
- Goodbye, Lloyd.
- Goodbye, Eileen.

434
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,125
Goodbye, Lloyd.

435
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:59,595
Eileen, why did you tell him
you were busy tonight?

436
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,017
Because I don’t want to see Lloyd Gruver
when you ask him to see me.

437
00:37:05,143 --> 00:37:10,816
Besides, I do have a date with that young
lieutenant and his wife from Fort Bragg.

438
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:12,985
A whole bunch of us.

439
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:22,453
I hope you don’t lose my man for me.

440
00:37:44,143 --> 00:37:47,229
Give me a martini, will you?

441
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:49,982
No, make it a lemonade.

442
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:53,820
No, give me a scotch and soda.

443
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:57,907
- Scotch and soda.
- Scotch and soda, sir.

444
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:03,204
There’s such a thing as insolence
through manner, you know.

445
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:11,714
I hate to admit it,
but I guess that’s what I said.

446
00:38:13,215 --> 00:38:18,804
I thought it sounded kinda strange coming
from a guy who shot down nine MiGs.

447
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,266
That’s a kind of reflex action.
I’m a West Point man, you know.

448
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:25,145
I guess it sneaks out sometimes.

449
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:33,695
So listen, Captain, what does a fella
do round here after the sun goes down?

450
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,406
Why? You on the loose?

451
00:38:37,741 --> 00:38:39,577
Halfway.

452
00:38:39,702 --> 00:38:42,288
Bring him another.

453
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:45,583
What part of the south are you from?

454
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:50,004
Almost any old place
that’s got an army post on it.

455
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:53,174
I was all set to take the exams
for West Point

456
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:58,722
and there was a teacher there who
made me take a part in the school play.

457
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:03,268
They were doing one of
those Hungarian things by Molnár.

458
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:08,190
You never did hear a Hungarian play
played in a southern accent, did you?

459
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:13,113
- No, I’m afraid I missed that.
- That’s a shame. I was awful good in it.

460
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:17,284
Anyhow, I suddenly
didn’t wanna go to West Point

461
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:20,829
and didn’t wanna have
anything to do with it.

462
00:39:20,954 --> 00:39:24,416
My mother come up to school and...

463
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:30,506
She said “We expected you to go to
the Point like your father and his father.”

464
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:38,139
And I told her, I said I had an idea
about a whole different way of life.

465
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:40,391
What’d she say to that?

466
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:43,353
She said something like...

467
00:39:43,478 --> 00:39:48,608
if I ever once had that idea,
I shouldn’t let anything stop me.

468
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:53,488
And she couldn’t come right out
and say “Don’t go to the Point”,

469
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:56,241
but I knew what she meant.

470
00:39:56,825 --> 00:39:59,495
Then my father flew up from Texas and...

471
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:01,706
He put you straight, huh?

472
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:07,879
He just looked at me and said “If you don’t
wanna go to the Point, don’t go.”

473
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:12,133
”The unhappiest men I know
are those who...

474
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:16,055
were forced into something
they got no inaptitude for.”

475
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,350
How did he force you to go to the Point?

476
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:22,061
That’s what I’m telling you.
He didn’t force me.

477
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:28,400
We just had a little talk and he flew
back to Texas and I went on to the Point.

478
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:30,820
I see.

479
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:35,116
Well, I’ll tell you something though, Mike,

480
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:39,287
I never once had any regrets
about going to the Point.

481
00:40:39,412 --> 00:40:45,252
Except, just lately, I’ve had
some old feeling come back on me.

482
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:49,465
I don’t know if I wanna go on
in the air force and buck for a star,

483
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:55,888
get married into the Webster family
and get swallowed up by all that.

484
00:40:56,013 --> 00:40:58,975
I think maybe my old lady was right.

485
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:03,939
Well, what does it all mean?

486
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:07,359
The eternal struggle, sex,

487
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:09,528
New York Yankees.

488
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:12,906
All right. Quit now. Come on.

489
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:25,753
- Ain’t that a nice-looking bridge?
- That’s the Bitchi-Bashi.

490
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:28,965
- Say what?
- The Bitchi-Bashi.

491
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:34,138
Bashď’s Japanese for bridge. We call
this particular one the Bitchi-Bashi

492
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:38,851
because there’s so much
lovely stuff that goes over it.

493
00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:41,145
Did you say stuff?

494
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,314
Brother, I said stuff.

495
00:41:44,857 --> 00:41:48,403
Would you care to tell me
what we’re standing in the bushes for?

496
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:50,613
- Can’t touch it.
- Why not?

497
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:55,118
These girls that go over there
are the Matsubayashi girls.

498
00:41:55,243 --> 00:42:00,582
They just cross over there on the way
to the theatre from those dormitories.

499
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:03,544
" That’s right.
Somebody told me about them.

500
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:08,716
Hey, boy, is there anything
going over there now?

501
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,929
" Hey, come on.
The goods are on display.

502
00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:16,098
Wait for me, buddy.

503
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:48,091
There’s Fumiko-san,
the one you saw me with.

504
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:51,804
- Yeah, little one in pink.
- Yeah, that’s the one.

505
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:55,849
Are you goin’ over to say hello?

506
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:59,186
In public? A Matsubayashi girl?
Are you nuts?

507
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:03,357
- You’d take her to the officers’ club.
- That’s for Americans.

508
00:43:03,482 --> 00:43:06,736
Thought I could sneak her in
without her being recognized.

509
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,573
- " What happens if they catch her?
- " Immediate dismissal.

510
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:12,450
- " No fooling?
- " Yeah.

511
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:15,662
No Matsubayashi girl is allowed
to have dates of any kind.

512
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:18,164
You were dating her.

513
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:20,333
Well, I’m different.

514
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:22,503
Get outta here.

515
00:43:22,628 --> 00:43:28,050
Like I told President Truman “You was
wrong when you sold the marines short.”

516
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:33,264
See, I hate to be stuffy about this, but
you air-force men wouldn’t understand.

517
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:40,480
The marines have got "l’amour," and these
girls, they got fame, wealth, bright lights.

518
00:43:40,605 --> 00:43:44,609
- But they ain’t got "l’amour."
- You got "l’amour."

519
00:43:53,494 --> 00:43:56,456
- What’s going on now?
- Hana-ogi’s coming.

520
00:43:56,581 --> 00:44:00,293
- Who?
- Hana-ogi. She’s the top. Number one.

521
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:06,090
Come on, let’s go.

522
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:28,531
How come she’s dressed like that?

523
00:44:28,657 --> 00:44:31,785
Tall ones play men’s parts mostly.

524
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,705
- They play women’s parts too.
- How do you do?

525
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:44,215
What do you say let’s see the show?

526
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,093
Well, come on, Ace.

527
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:29,724
- Do you follow the plot?
- Yeah, nothing wrong with the plot.

528
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:37,511
Are you sure they come back this way?

529
00:50:37,636 --> 00:50:40,807
Just keep yourself in check, son.

530
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:44,602
Am I nuts
or is she the greatest thing I ever saw?

531
00:50:44,728 --> 00:50:48,232
Whatever you’re thinking, forget it.
You ain’t going anyplace.

532
00:50:48,357 --> 00:50:50,693
Yeah? How’s this for introduction?

533
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:55,281
She comes along and I just kinda
walk on by and slip my arm around her.

534
00:50:55,406 --> 00:50:59,161
- What do you think of that?
- I think we’d better go.

535
00:50:59,286 --> 00:51:02,164
- Major.
- Hey, Kelly, how are you?

536
00:51:03,165 --> 00:51:05,626
- How’s everything?
- Saw you at the show.

537
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:08,713
I want you to meet Captain Bailey.
This is Airman Kelly.

538
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:10,965
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

539
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,302
- How you been, boy?
- Fine.

540
00:51:13,427 --> 00:51:16,805
- Here’s Katsumi.
- Hello there, Katsumi.

541
00:51:17,473 --> 00:51:22,854
- Say something, kid.
- It is fine to see you among us tonight.

542
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,107
She’s speaking better English
than you are, boy.

543
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:30,279
She’s been taking English lessons
and I’ve been studying a little Japanese.

544
00:51:30,404 --> 00:51:32,865
Let’s hear you go.

545
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,997
I hope he can get rid of it, don’t you?

546
00:51:39,122 --> 00:51:42,125
It means “My feet are cold”.
She always laughs when I say that.

547
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,836
How you been?
How you gettin’ along down there?

548
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:49,050
Just fine, Major. We got
a wonderful house down by the canal.

549
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:53,262
Didn’t you tell me Katsumi
knows those Matsubayashi girls?

550
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:56,141
Sure, she’s a real fan.

551
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:58,894
I want you to do something for me.

552
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:02,941
I am trying in the worst way
to meet this Hana-ogi.

553
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:07,779
And I want you to ask her if she won’t,
you know, kinda introduce me.

554
00:52:21,753 --> 00:52:24,715
She says the rules are very strict
but she’ll ask her.

555
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,301
- She will ask her?
- " Oh, yeah.

556
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:31,681
Cos I said to Truman
when he came over to the house,

557
00:52:31,806 --> 00:52:36,103
”Harry, don’t ever sell the air force short.”

558
00:52:43,987 --> 00:52:47,782
All right, boy.
Now you gonna see something.

559
00:52:58,836 --> 00:53:00,881
Here comes Fumiko-san.

560
00:53:21,653 --> 00:53:23,781
- Here comes Hana-ogi.
- I know it.

561
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:33,125
- You ain’t gonna let me down? Go on.
- It’s all right, Major.

562
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,728
How d’you do, Miss Ogi?

563
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:57,569
You think you made the grade, Ace?

564
00:53:57,694 --> 00:54:00,406
She gave me a nice little look there.

565
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:02,991
She sure did.

566
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:26,685
She says that Hana-ogi
will not speak to an American.

567
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,437
Why not?

568
00:54:28,562 --> 00:54:31,899
We shot her brother
and killed her father with our bombs.

569
00:54:32,024 --> 00:54:34,235
I didn’t do it.

570
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,697
Sure you did, Ace. We all did.

571
00:54:38,907 --> 00:54:41,285
Come on.

572
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,454
Come on, Ace.

573
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:05,353
If they’re so strict with you, how come
you go out with Mike and fool around?

574
00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:08,148
It is very bad of me.

575
00:55:08,273 --> 00:55:11,277
But I cannot help myself.

576
00:55:11,402 --> 00:55:13,446
He’s so tall.

577
00:55:16,365 --> 00:55:21,371
He’s a big boy, all right.
There’s no fooling about that.

578
00:55:21,497 --> 00:55:26,293
But, listen, what I really wanna know is

579
00:55:26,418 --> 00:55:30,799
does this Hana-ogi ever go out on dates,
like you and Mike?

580
00:55:30,924 --> 00:55:36,305
No. She’s number one girl.
Must be special careful.

581
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:40,059
Well, I want you to do me a favor.

582
00:55:40,184 --> 00:55:44,564
Will you do it? When you go back
to the dormitory tonight,

583
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:50,278
I want you to tell Hana-ogi that
Major Gruver would like to meet her and...

584
00:55:50,404 --> 00:55:53,199
Wait. Now, wait.

585
00:55:53,324 --> 00:55:56,160
I just wanna talk to her for a little while.

586
00:55:56,285 --> 00:56:00,248
- Will you do that for me?
- Never happen.

587
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:04,128
Hana-ogi-san never speak men.

588
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,175
And with American never happen.

589
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,347
Well, honey, I am here to tell you
that it’s going to happen.

590
00:56:51,848 --> 00:56:58,606
Pardon me, Miss Ogi.
I wonder if I could have your autograph?

591
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,287
Thank you very much.

592
00:57:30,057 --> 00:57:32,519
How d’you do, Miss Ogi?

593
00:59:15,258 --> 00:59:18,554
Hi, Major. I’ve been looking for you.

594
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,974
Hello, Mr. Kelly.

595
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,269
The wife says to be at the house tonight.

596
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:32,444
No, I tell you, boy, I have an engagement
this evening with a friend of mine.

597
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:38,868
Be there, bub. Hana-ogi’s coming. Sir.

598
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:45,042
- Kelly...
- Be there early.

599
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:47,211
Kelly.

600
01:00:16,327 --> 01:00:18,371
- Hello.
- " Hello!

601
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:22,041
You know where Joe Kelly lives?

602
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:25,796
Over there? You show me, will you?

603
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,975
How do?

604
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:51,575
- Hi, Ace.
- Kelly, is that you?

605
01:00:52,534 --> 01:00:55,370
- How are you?
- How are you, Ace?

606
01:00:55,496 --> 01:00:59,292
- Nice to see you. Come in the house.
- Let me just take a check here.

607
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:01,419
- Did she come yet?
- No.

608
01:01:09,386 --> 01:01:10,387
Katsumi.

609
01:01:19,314 --> 01:01:22,610
- OK. What she say?
- Don’t ask me.

610
01:01:22,735 --> 01:01:26,447
Off with the shoes. You don’t
wear shoes in a Japanese house.

611
01:01:26,572 --> 01:01:29,408
Coming off. What about the pants?

612
01:01:29,534 --> 01:01:31,787
- The room on your right.
- Here?

613
01:01:31,912 --> 01:01:33,956
That’s it.

614
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,876
Watch your head, Ace. This is it.

615
01:01:38,002 --> 01:01:41,965
This is all right, boy.
This is cute. This is nice.

616
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:47,388
Sit down over here, Ace. That’s
the place of honor in a Japanese house.

617
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:51,308
What’s this thing?

618
01:01:51,433 --> 01:01:54,270
- This is an armrest.
- Armrest?

619
01:01:54,396 --> 01:01:57,691
Be even better
when the rest of the chair gets here.

620
01:02:05,283 --> 01:02:07,326
Hi, Katsumi, darling. How are you?

621
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:09,912
Yeah.

622
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:27,182
It is very nice to have you... among us.

623
01:02:27,892 --> 01:02:30,769
It’s very nice to be among you too.

624
01:02:42,574 --> 01:02:46,704
I brought a couple of things
you can stick round the house.

625
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:50,500
Yeah. Flowers.

626
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:55,464
You’ve made her very happy, Ace.

627
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:59,134
Are we gonna eat this or wear it?

628
01:02:59,259 --> 01:03:04,182
This is a little towel that they serve
before a meal or a drink.

629
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:08,729
- A little refresher for your hands and face.
- That’s a good idea.

630
01:03:08,854 --> 01:03:12,608
Wash ‘em off. OK, clean everywhere.

631
01:03:12,733 --> 01:03:14,777
Do I pass, teacher?

632
01:03:15,945 --> 01:03:18,198
Just dump it in the basket.

633
01:03:19,741 --> 01:03:21,451
Yes, sir.

634
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,624
What’s this, an eye cup?
We got to wash our eyes out too?

635
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:30,545
No, that’s a cup for sake.
That’s a wine made out of rice.

636
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:33,423
- Rice? No fooling.
- No fooling.

637
01:03:33,549 --> 01:03:36,385
- I’ll try it.
- Taste it. You’ll see.

638
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:40,430
- Feels warm.
- We heat it up before we serve it.

639
01:03:42,976 --> 01:03:47,230
Katsumi, here’s to your house.
And, Kelly, very best to you.

640
01:03:51,485 --> 01:03:55,447
- That’s all right, boy. Not bad.
- I told you. It’s wonderful.

641
01:03:55,573 --> 01:03:58,285
- You not gonna have anything?
- I was just gonna say.

642
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,037
There’s kind of a polite thing you do.

643
01:04:01,163 --> 01:04:06,669
You take the cup, you swish it around
in the water and pour some sake for her.

644
01:04:06,794 --> 01:04:08,838
- OK.
- That’s right.

645
01:04:14,303 --> 01:04:16,889
- It means “a little bit”.
- All righty.

646
01:04:17,014 --> 01:04:19,892
Hold on now. Wait. OK.

647
01:04:24,314 --> 01:04:26,357
See? Didn’t hurt.

648
01:04:28,526 --> 01:04:31,155
She’s gonna get me
under the table in five minutes.

649
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:36,285
She’ll keep pouring all night.
Katsumi, I pour for Gruver-san now.

650
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,583
You excuse me? I finish cooking.

651
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:46,338
You go ahead, darling.
Go right ahead. Go right ahead.

652
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,725
A present. Whisky.

653
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,894
Whisky?

654
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:23,505
Listen, boy, she’s just as cute as a bug.
You ain’t gonna lose with her.

655
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:28,134
See what I mean, Ace?
I’m the happiest guy in the world.

656
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,888
- You wanna see the rest of the house?
- Yeah.

657
01:05:32,473 --> 01:05:34,725
I’ll show you round.

658
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:40,190
This is the garden. Katsumi,
I’m showing him around the house.

659
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:48,449
The bathroom is back there. We got extra
rooms here. Would you like to see ‘em?

660
01:05:48,575 --> 01:05:50,618
Yeah.

661
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:54,248
What you got here, boy?

662
01:05:54,373 --> 01:05:55,624
Oh, lord!

663
01:05:59,879 --> 01:06:04,426
We haven’t done anything with these yet
but maybe someday, if we expand.

664
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:07,137
It’s really working out for you, isn’t it?

665
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:11,309
Everything’s perfect, except for
that rat of a colonel I’m assigned to.

666
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,020
You wouldn’t be talking about Crawford?

667
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:17,732
That’s the guy. He rides every guy
that’s married to a Japanese girl.

668
01:06:17,858 --> 01:06:20,235
Extra duty, everything.

669
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,280
He’s a rough cob, no getting around that.

670
01:06:23,405 --> 01:06:27,494
So what do I care? I come home to my girl
and I forget it. Let’s go.

671
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:33,416
Wait. I forgot to ask you.
Does this Hana-ogi speak any English?

672
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:36,045
Those girls sing in a lot of languages.

673
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:39,298
I guess she’ll be able
to catch your drift, Ace.

674
01:06:39,423 --> 01:06:45,055
You nasty boy, you. Wait a minute.
I just got to take a look at my grass now.

675
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:50,310
Are we gonna be, all four of us
gonna be together all evening long?

676
01:06:50,435 --> 01:06:54,106
Take it easy, Ace.
You’re gonna blow a fuse.

677
01:06:54,232 --> 01:06:56,275
Well...

678
01:06:58,069 --> 01:07:00,447
Might be.

679
01:07:00,572 --> 01:07:04,409
- Your lumber’s wrong.
- Watch your head, Ace.

680
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:09,582
Katsumi, you ready?

681
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:14,128
In here? You gonna have to change...

682
01:07:21,554 --> 01:07:23,974
Kelly.

683
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:36,696
Hana-ogi-san.
This is a great day for our house.

684
01:07:38,573 --> 01:07:40,617
Major Gruver-san.

685
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,664
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

686
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:52,088
- Where you going?
- I gotta help Katsumi with the...

687
01:07:56,594 --> 01:08:02,099
It looks as though everybody’s ran off
and left us alone here.

688
01:08:02,224 --> 01:08:06,438
Certainly was nice of you
to come over here this evening, Miss Ogi.

689
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:12,152
I was just tickled to death
when they told me you were coming over.

690
01:08:13,529 --> 01:08:15,573
I’ll just sit down here.

691
01:08:19,452 --> 01:08:21,497
Well, Miss Ogi.

692
01:08:22,915 --> 01:08:25,375
Let me fix you a little drink.

693
01:08:26,376 --> 01:08:29,463
No, not... Well, OK.

694
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:38,516
Here’s to you.

695
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:46,233
It’s good. Don’t tell me. I know you’ve got
to slosh this around in here a little bit

696
01:08:46,358 --> 01:08:50,862
and get the dribble off
and give it right back to you.

697
01:08:50,987 --> 01:08:53,031
Now you take that.

698
01:08:55,743 --> 01:08:57,787
All right.

699
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:05,838
I was surprised to find
that they make that stuff out of rice.

700
01:09:05,963 --> 01:09:09,007
We have rice back home in America.

701
01:09:09,132 --> 01:09:12,971
We just make rice pudding out of it.
We don’t drink it.

702
01:09:13,096 --> 01:09:16,808
This is the first liquid rice I’ve ran into.

703
01:09:25,526 --> 01:09:27,571
You know, did...

704
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:33,910
Did anyone ever tell you, Miss Ogi,
that you’re a fine-looking woman?

705
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:36,080
I mean, really fine.

706
01:09:37,832 --> 01:09:43,630
You’re even better looking offstage
than you are on. That’s the truth.

707
01:09:43,755 --> 01:09:47,217
You get up there and sing,
dance, act, everything.

708
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:49,469
You’re all-round great.

709
01:09:55,852 --> 01:10:01,233
I wonder where Kelly and Katsumi...
I’m getting kinda hungry again.

710
01:10:06,572 --> 01:10:08,617
Look, Miss Ogi...

711
01:10:10,285 --> 01:10:15,790
I’m not up to Japanese ways of doing
things. Maybe I’m saying the wrong thing.

712
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:19,962
Maybe my American manners
are embarrassing.

713
01:10:20,087 --> 01:10:22,590
But I figured,
as you came over here tonight,

714
01:10:22,715 --> 01:10:25,761
maybe you were interested
a little bit in meeting me too.

715
01:10:25,886 --> 01:10:33,728
Maybe I’m wrong, but if I’m wrong, then
you got to tell me where we go from here.

716
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:38,608
Cos I don’t know what to say.
I’m runnin’ out of things to say.

717
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:49,119
My father was killed by American bomb
dropped on my country.

718
01:10:50,622 --> 01:10:53,083
You have been my enemy.

719
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,797
I have hated Americans.

720
01:10:57,922 --> 01:11:00,800
I have thought they are savages.

721
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,973
There has been nothing
but vengeance in my heart.

722
01:11:06,098 --> 01:11:11,895
Miss Ogi, there were an awful lot
of Americans that were killed too.

723
01:11:13,355 --> 01:11:16,860
I think it would be best
if we forgot about that.

724
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:22,323
You have been watching me at the bridge.

725
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,493
Watching me dance.

726
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:29,665
Watching me
as I go back to the dormitory.

727
01:11:31,209 --> 01:11:34,087
But I have been watching you too.

728
01:11:35,589 --> 01:11:39,093
And you have not looked like a savage.

729
01:11:40,011 --> 01:11:43,181
And when Katsumi-san told me
how gently you kissed her

730
01:11:43,306 --> 01:11:46,601
the day she became a bride,

731
01:11:46,726 --> 01:11:50,856
how tenderly you kissed
my sweet little friend,

732
01:11:52,357 --> 01:11:55,737
I realized the hate was of my own making.

733
01:11:57,906 --> 01:12:02,410
That is why I came
to ask you to forgive me

734
01:12:02,535 --> 01:12:04,997
for what I have been feeling.

735
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:09,877
Gruver-san, will you forgive me?

736
01:12:14,507 --> 01:12:18,303
You make me feel
like an awful fool, Miss Ogi.

737
01:12:20,556 --> 01:12:24,519
I really feel that
I oughta ask you to forgive me

738
01:12:24,644 --> 01:12:29,691
for some of the things that...
I’ve been thinking.

739
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:38,326
I come from the north of Japan
and my father was a farmer.

740
01:12:38,451 --> 01:12:41,162
There were nine children.

741
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:43,998
And we were very poor.

742
01:12:44,123 --> 01:12:48,170
There are too many people
in my crowded country.

743
01:12:48,295 --> 01:12:51,715
I took the examination at Matsubayashi

744
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,511
and now I am first dancer of all.

745
01:12:56,137 --> 01:13:00,684
When I’m too old to dance,
I will become head teacher.

746
01:13:03,187 --> 01:13:06,023
My life is planned.

747
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:09,444
I am dedicated to Matsubayashi,

748
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:13,699
as you are dedicated
to American military life.

749
01:13:16,118 --> 01:13:18,788
I have never been in love...

750
01:13:19,956 --> 01:13:24,210
but I have dreamed and thought about it...

751
01:13:25,336 --> 01:13:27,381
and waited.

752
01:13:30,384 --> 01:13:35,098
The danger that lies ahead of us,
we must face now.

753
01:13:37,434 --> 01:13:40,729
The danger of discovery for both of us.

754
01:13:42,398 --> 01:13:46,944
The danger of weakness when it is over.

755
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:56,788
I will never fall in love again.

756
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:05,173
But I will love you, if that is your desire.

757
01:14:47,011 --> 01:14:49,056
How do you do?

758
01:14:52,935 --> 01:14:55,521
- Miss Webster.
- Hello.

759
01:14:57,524 --> 01:15:00,860
- Mr. Nakamura, how nice of you to come.
- It is a great pleasure.

760
01:15:00,986 --> 01:15:03,905
And may I say that you look
especially beautiful today.

761
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:06,701
I haven’t been
to this month’s kabuki programme.

762
01:15:06,826 --> 01:15:09,537
I know. You see, I have been waiting.

763
01:15:09,662 --> 01:15:13,250
- Eileen.
- Mother, you remember Mr. Nakamura.

764
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:16,086
- How do you do, Mrs. Webster?
- Yes, of course.

765
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,755
This party isn’t given especially for you.

766
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,802
You’ve got to circulate around
and cement Japanese-American relations.

767
01:15:22,927 --> 01:15:26,723
That’s exactly what
Mr. Nakamura and I are doing.

768
01:15:26,848 --> 01:15:32,146
Nakamura-san, my little girl wants
your autograph. She admires you so.

769
01:15:32,271 --> 01:15:37,026
- Of course. Will you please excuse me?
- Yes, of course.

770
01:15:39,112 --> 01:15:41,364
Has Lloyd come yet?

771
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:44,242
How many weeks
are you gonna keep on pretending?

772
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:48,664
- Lloyd is not coming.
- I’m absolutely furious at him.

773
01:15:48,789 --> 01:15:52,960
How can he ignore the general’s
invitation? I had it delivered to his office.

774
01:15:53,085 --> 01:15:57,424
I’m stuck with that Farrington woman.
Can you help me out?

775
01:15:59,009 --> 01:16:04,098
Uh-oh. There’s Crawford. Whenever
he shows up, there’s always something.

776
01:16:04,224 --> 01:16:07,101
Can I speak to you alone
for a minute, General?

777
01:16:07,227 --> 01:16:12,524
Major, do you have that list with you?
I want to see if the Williams have come.

778
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,109
Yes, they have.

779
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:18,197
Waiter. Could you leave?

780
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:26,915
The reason I took this up with you
is because it concerns Major Gruver.

781
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:30,628
We think he’s hooked
onto a Japanese dame.

782
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:33,548
I’m sorry, but this thing’s
gotten me all riled up.

783
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,552
Do you realize what it’ll mean
to the enlisted men

784
01:16:36,677 --> 01:16:39,846
if they find out that their big hero,
Ace Gruver, is out with...

785
01:16:39,972 --> 01:16:44,477
I’ve known Major Gruver all his life.
I’m a close friend of his father’s.

786
01:16:44,602 --> 01:16:48,022
- I assure you, you must be wrong.
- He was seen going into that house.

787
01:16:48,147 --> 01:16:51,442
My men have been watching
a troublemaker named Kelly.

788
01:16:51,568 --> 01:16:56,240
- He’s shacked up with another native...
- Kelly’s married to a Japanese girl.

789
01:16:56,365 --> 01:17:00,579
Major Gruver was the best man. It seems
quite natural to me that he’d visit them.

790
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:03,790
- How am I gonna handle the situation?
- Don’t handle it.

791
01:17:03,915 --> 01:17:06,459
I trust Major Gruver implicitly.

792
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:09,630
Is it all right with you if I post an order

793
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:15,511
to keep these officers from being seen
with indigenous personnel?

794
01:17:15,636 --> 01:17:18,015
If they are seen,
there’s something we can do.

795
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,308
All right.

796
01:17:42,918 --> 01:17:44,169
Lloyd.

797
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:08,780
No one saw you come?

798
01:18:08,905 --> 01:18:13,952
No, there’s no military personnel
around here. Except me.

799
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:19,917
- We must go to the tea ceremony.
- Yeah, I know.

800
01:18:21,085 --> 01:18:23,129
Good afternoon.

801
01:18:28,718 --> 01:18:32,431
All this getting up and down like to kill me.

802
01:19:04,759 --> 01:19:08,346
He makes such a production
of everything.

803
01:19:09,764 --> 01:19:13,060
The pleasure does not lie in the end itself.

804
01:19:13,185 --> 01:19:16,439
It’s the pleasurable steps to that end.

805
01:19:16,564 --> 01:19:18,608
I see.

806
01:19:46,598 --> 01:19:49,142
- That you, Ace?
- Yeah, Kelly.

807
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:53,356
- Come on in here.
- I can’t right now.

808
01:19:54,941 --> 01:19:58,194
He’d be surprised you come in this way.

809
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:00,696
He’d faint.

810
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:04,785
Just a little lower, Katsumi.
You always seem to be a little above it.

811
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:07,204
Yeah, that’s it. Yeah, yeah.

812
01:20:18,217 --> 01:20:20,552
Kelly-san, now you get in tub?

813
01:20:20,678 --> 01:20:22,721
OK, all right.

814
01:20:23,973 --> 01:20:28,353
- Is Hana-ogi coming over tonight?
- Yeah, if she can get away.

815
01:20:28,478 --> 01:20:34,694
We gonna cook up some fine St Louis
goulash with a little Memphis greens.

816
01:20:38,531 --> 01:20:42,703
What are you doing tonight after dinner
when Hana-ogi goes back to the theatre?

817
01:20:42,828 --> 01:20:44,246
" Nothing.

818
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:46,957
How about playing poker
with Katsumi and me?

819
01:20:47,082 --> 01:20:51,504
" I’d be delighted
to take your money, and your pants.

820
01:20:53,506 --> 01:20:56,467
This is the life, ain’t it, Ace?

821
01:21:34,385 --> 01:21:36,429
There you are.

822
01:21:41,518 --> 01:21:43,562
How d’you do?

823
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,829
I got one word for you.

824
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:01,415
- What is that?
- Food.

825
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:19,227
# Sayonara

826
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:23,816
# Japanese goodbye

827
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:28,862
# Whisper “Sayonara”

828
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:33,034
# Lover, don’t you cry

829
01:22:34,286 --> 01:22:39,125
# No more we stop to see

830
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:42,920
# Pretty cherry blossom

831
01:22:44,213 --> 01:22:49,136
# No more we ‘neath the tree

832
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:52,931
# Looking at the sky

833
01:22:53,975 --> 01:22:58,688
# Sayonara

834
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:04,111
# Sayonara

835
01:23:04,236 --> 01:23:09,199
# Goodbye

836
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:15,624
That’s the cutest thing I ever saw, honey.

837
01:23:15,749 --> 01:23:17,792
I must go.

838
01:23:19,253 --> 01:23:22,256
Ooh! Good eatin’.

839
01:23:23,966 --> 01:23:24,967
Bye-bye.

840
01:23:25,092 --> 01:23:28,555
Are you going back
to the officers’ quarters tonight?

841
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,892
No, I think I’m gonna just
fool around here.

842
01:23:32,017 --> 01:23:34,311
What will you do all evening?

843
01:23:34,436 --> 01:23:38,066
What am I gonna do?
I’m gonna get some beer, pretzels, girls.

844
01:23:38,191 --> 01:23:40,526
I’m gonna have a little fun for a change.

845
01:23:40,652 --> 01:23:43,822
Good. I don’t like you to be lonely.

846
01:23:49,912 --> 01:23:51,957
Take care.

847
01:24:15,857 --> 01:24:17,902
Come on in, Katsumi.

848
01:24:22,282 --> 01:24:25,703
I’m sorry, Lloyd.
I had to come. It’s important.

849
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:27,871
Hello, Eileen.

850
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:33,878
How are you?

851
01:24:34,004 --> 01:24:36,631
Sit down, will you?

852
01:24:36,756 --> 01:24:41,637
I’ll take this stuff out the way.
I was just gettin’ a little...

853
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,650
Sit down here.

854
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,191
How are you?

855
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:10,822
- They’re after you, Lloyd.
- Who’s after me?

856
01:25:10,947 --> 01:25:14,784
There’s a colonel. His name’s Crawford.

857
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,953
Oh, yeah.

858
01:25:18,454 --> 01:25:20,582
I know him.

859
01:25:20,707 --> 01:25:24,252
He’s the one that’s riding Kelly.
This is Kelly’s house.

860
01:25:24,377 --> 01:25:26,421
Yes, I know.

861
01:25:28,506 --> 01:25:33,177
- You want to hear this, don’t you, Lloyd?
- Yeah, sure. Course I do.

862
01:25:33,303 --> 01:25:38,975
I overheard Colonel Crawford say
that he’s been having this house watched,

863
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:44,397
hoping to catch Kelly
at something irregular, I suppose.

864
01:25:44,522 --> 01:25:47,066
Anyhow, that’s how I knew where it was.

865
01:25:47,191 --> 01:25:52,739
Well, then they... they’ve seen me
coming in and out of here.

866
01:25:52,864 --> 01:25:54,908
Yes.

867
01:25:56,868 --> 01:25:59,829
I just felt that I had to tell you...

868
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:07,295
Eileen...

869
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:11,007
There’s something that I feel that...

870
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:18,932
I must go, Lloyd. I just wanted to warn you
to be particularly careful about...

871
01:26:19,057 --> 01:26:21,100
About what, honey?

872
01:26:23,895 --> 01:26:28,316
About sticking strictly
to military regulations.

873
01:26:28,441 --> 01:26:31,611
Lloyd, they’ll do anything
to hang something on you,

874
01:26:31,736 --> 01:26:33,780
to keep you in line.

875
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:40,828
After all, you’re the air force’s
pin-up boy, you know.

876
01:26:42,956 --> 01:26:47,293
Colonel Crawford sounded
as if he was after blood.

877
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:57,762
- More than anything I could think of...
- I must go now, Lloyd. Good luck.

878
01:26:57,887 --> 01:27:00,848
Wait a minute. Let me help you.

879
01:27:03,142 --> 01:27:05,228
Eileen, I know...

880
01:27:05,311 --> 01:27:12,151
Lloyd, you’ve really thought seriously
about what you’re doing, haven’t you?

881
01:27:14,654 --> 01:27:17,115
Yes, I...

882
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,242
I think I have.

883
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,411
I hope so.

884
01:27:23,288 --> 01:27:28,001
You’ve a brilliant record in the air force.
People depend upon you.

885
01:27:28,126 --> 01:27:33,923
Before you throw all that you’ve worked
for away, be sure. Please be sure.

886
01:27:37,343 --> 01:27:44,225
Eileen, I don’t think if I had a million years
that I could tell you how all this happened.

887
01:27:47,353 --> 01:27:50,064
I’d better go before I lose all my charm.

888
01:28:19,219 --> 01:28:22,263
Do you like this old curious play?

889
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:27,602
Yeah, I’m beginning to get a kick out of it.

890
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:37,111
- See the rope between the rocks?
- Yeah.

891
01:28:37,237 --> 01:28:40,657
That is a Shinto sign
showing they are married.

892
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:42,867
- What, the rocks?
- Yes.

893
01:28:42,992 --> 01:28:47,288
They’ve been together so long, our people
thought it was time they got married.

894
01:28:47,413 --> 01:28:53,044
- They look well together, don’t you think?
- Yeah. Make a handsome little couple.

895
01:28:53,169 --> 01:28:55,088
Do you like my country?

896
01:28:55,213 --> 01:28:59,217
Yeah, was all these funny things here
before when I came through Japan?

897
01:28:59,342 --> 01:29:01,386
Yes.

898
01:29:11,187 --> 01:29:14,440
- Well, hello.
- Hello there, double-double ugly.

899
01:29:14,566 --> 01:29:17,193
To what do we owe
the honor of this visit?

900
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:22,365
Laundry. Gonna put down the dirties
and pick up the cleans.

901
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:28,663
I hope you know what you’re doing.

902
01:29:28,788 --> 01:29:31,249
This came in.
Thought you might like to see it.

903
01:29:31,374 --> 01:29:35,920
”This is a routine reminder of
the recent orders issued by Camp Kobe:”

904
01:29:36,045 --> 01:29:39,632
”Any public display of affection

is forbidden.”

906
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:44,929
”Officers should not even
appear on public streets

907
01:29:45,054 --> 01:29:48,641
accompanied by indigenous
female personnel.”

908
01:29:48,766 --> 01:29:52,770
- Hooray for Christmas.
- This is serious. Everybody got one.

909
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:56,733
Listen, fool, Hana-ogi and I
are just as careful as we can be.

910
01:29:56,858 --> 01:30:00,904
We never go anyplace where we’re gonna
be seen by anybody that matters.

911
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:03,907
We don’t even walk down the same street.

912
01:30:04,032 --> 01:30:07,452
We just go out in the country
and fool around.

913
01:30:07,577 --> 01:30:11,247
You’ve never been to the country
around here, have you?

914
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:14,626
Awful pretty country round here. I mean it.

915
01:30:15,335 --> 01:30:19,631
You know what I saw yesterday?
I saw two rocks that just got married.

916
01:30:19,756 --> 01:30:23,218
- You what?
- I saw two rocks that got married.

917
01:30:23,343 --> 01:30:26,930
- And they looked very happy together too.
- I’ll bet they did.

918
01:30:27,055 --> 01:30:32,602
They did. If you were gonna be smart,
I’ll tell you what you’d do.

919
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:35,146
You’d get your shoes shined
and go out tonight,

920
01:30:35,271 --> 01:30:38,107
cos tonight is gonna be Tanabata.

921
01:30:38,942 --> 01:30:40,985
OK, what’s Tanabata?

922
01:30:42,111 --> 01:30:46,115
You’re gonna sit there and tell me
you don’t know what Tanabata is?

923
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:47,700
Yeah.

924
01:30:47,825 --> 01:30:50,161
My word, boy. I’m ashamed of you.

925
01:30:50,286 --> 01:30:52,956
I thought everybody knew
what Tanabata was.

926
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:55,750
Tanabata is the night of love.

927
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:58,294
You told me all about it one time.

928
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:03,716
You were telling me about Harry Truman
and New York Yankees and sex,

929
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:06,928
and New York Yankees
and Harry Truman and sex.

930
01:31:26,155 --> 01:31:29,617
What have I done
to deserve such happiness?

931
01:31:29,742 --> 01:31:35,248
I have seen this night of Tanabata
come and go many times,

932
01:31:35,373 --> 01:31:39,586
but never before
have I understood what it meant.

933
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:43,214
Tanabata.

934
01:31:43,339 --> 01:31:46,426
My heart is so full of love for you.

935
01:32:30,595 --> 01:32:32,639
- Miss Webster?
- Yes?

936
01:32:32,764 --> 01:32:36,851
Nakamura-san get your note.
Here is reply.

937
01:32:36,976 --> 01:32:41,022
He wishes if you will have dinner
with him and his guests.

938
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:43,191
Thank you very much.

939
01:33:12,804 --> 01:33:17,976
They have a rather pleasant
garden here, Miss Webster.

940
01:33:19,435 --> 01:33:23,189
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes, I think I would.

941
01:33:47,672 --> 01:33:50,133
How beautiful.

942
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:01,311
What are you really afraid of,
Miss Webster?

943
01:34:01,436 --> 01:34:07,233
You don’t think it would enter Major
Gruver’s mind to marry a Japanese girl?

944
01:34:08,985 --> 01:34:11,029
I don’t know.

945
01:34:11,154 --> 01:34:13,781
Then permit me to reassure you.

946
01:34:13,907 --> 01:34:19,412
I think Major Gruver is brave,
but not brave enough to face the censure

947
01:34:19,537 --> 01:34:22,373
that would result from such a marriage.

948
01:34:22,498 --> 01:34:26,586
As for our famous, honored Hana-ogi,

949
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:30,673
there are many Japanese -
most of them, in fact -

950
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:33,092
who look upon marriage to an Occidental

951
01:34:33,218 --> 01:34:37,430
with as much distaste
as your people do to one of us.

952
01:34:38,556 --> 01:34:41,267
I do not feel that way,

953
01:34:41,392 --> 01:34:44,938
but then I have had the privilege
of traveling in your country

954
01:34:45,063 --> 01:34:48,858
and knowing some great people there.

955
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:52,820
And I am especially conscious
at this moment

956
01:34:52,946 --> 01:34:58,076
that beauty is not confined
to any one race.

957
01:35:01,663 --> 01:35:03,998
Do not turn away, Miss Webster.

958
01:35:04,123 --> 01:35:09,379
I am not necessarily making love to you.

959
01:35:12,632 --> 01:35:17,387
I am only stating a very obvious fact.

960
01:35:19,764 --> 01:35:22,517
May I see you again, Miss Webster,

961
01:35:22,642 --> 01:35:26,396
and acquaint you with more Japan?

962
01:35:27,438 --> 01:35:29,274
Of course.

963
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:33,987
I need to know more, much more,
about everything.

964
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:57,093
There she is.

965
01:35:59,012 --> 01:36:01,055
Hello, honey.

966
01:36:13,109 --> 01:36:15,153
Are you tired?

967
01:36:17,322 --> 01:36:22,493
No, I just been lying here
thinking about myself.

968
01:36:23,661 --> 01:36:26,414
I can’t believe I’m really here.

969
01:36:27,415 --> 01:36:31,669
It’s hard to believe
me being the same Lloyd Gruver

970
01:36:31,794 --> 01:36:35,924
that came over from Korea
just a little bit ago.

971
01:36:38,551 --> 01:36:44,557
I’ve been thinking
that all my life I’ve been so busy...

972
01:36:45,516 --> 01:36:48,478
snapping to and giving orders
and taking orders

973
01:36:48,603 --> 01:36:54,067
and being a general’s son
and doing the job and all that,

974
01:36:54,192 --> 01:36:58,112
I just never took time
to sit right down and...

975
01:36:59,489 --> 01:37:03,826
you know, think about
what my reason for living is.

976
01:37:06,454 --> 01:37:10,500
And I’ve been spending
some afternoons here just...

977
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:15,255
bein’ peaceful and easy and thinking.

978
01:37:17,966 --> 01:37:21,052
And I believe for the first time I...

979
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:28,351
I’m just beginning to understand
what it’s all about,

980
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:34,023
what I really am and what I really want.

981
01:37:34,148 --> 01:37:36,192
It’s a nice feeling.

982
01:37:45,451 --> 01:37:47,870
Come on in.

983
01:37:47,996 --> 01:37:50,915
Ace, excuse me. I hate to bother you.

984
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,168
- I just got the news.
- You got what news?

985
01:37:54,294 --> 01:37:58,464
- I’m gettin’ shipped back.
- You’re being shipped back where?

986
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:02,594
Stateside. I’ve been reassigned
to a new duty station.

987
01:38:04,721 --> 01:38:07,348
Well...

988
01:38:07,473 --> 01:38:09,934
- Did you tell Katsumi yet?
- No.

989
01:38:10,059 --> 01:38:12,770
Don’t tell her.
Maybe we can work something out.

990
01:38:12,896 --> 01:38:16,316
What reason did they give you for it?

991
01:38:16,441 --> 01:38:19,903
No reason. But I know what it is.

992
01:38:20,028 --> 01:38:24,449
Every guy on that list
is married to a Japanese girl.

993
01:38:28,328 --> 01:38:32,248
I’m sorry, Major.
There’s nothing you can do.

994
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:39,923
We’re sending Kelly to the States
Thursday, and that’s that.

995
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:43,635
What about his wife, Colonel?

996
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,803
She stays here.

997
01:38:46,721 --> 01:38:50,642
He knew he couldn’t take her back
with him when he married her.

998
01:38:50,767 --> 01:38:53,436
- Didn’t you?
- That’s right.

999
01:38:54,896 --> 01:38:57,148
You’d be busting up his home, then.

1000
01:38:57,273 --> 01:38:59,734
I’m not busting up anything.

1001
01:39:01,486 --> 01:39:05,907
Though I admit Kelly’s been
a pain in my side for quite a while now.

1002
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:10,328
Could you tell me why he didn’t have
the privilege of extending his tour of duty?

1003
01:39:10,453 --> 01:39:16,084
Don’t ask me, Major. There are lots
of reasons for these things.

1004
01:39:16,209 --> 01:39:21,923
Anyway, it is an order
and there’s nothing you can do about it,

1005
01:39:22,048 --> 01:39:25,593
even if you are a four-star general’s son.

1006
01:39:25,718 --> 01:39:27,762
Yeah, well...

1007
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:36,896
Would it make any difference if I told you
my wife’s gonna have a baby?

1008
01:39:37,564 --> 01:39:40,024
That’s tough, I admit.

1009
01:39:42,068 --> 01:39:46,322
Colonel, under these circumstances,
don’t you think that you’d be able to

1010
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:49,325
postpone this for a little while?

1011
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:52,579
Maybe I could be transferred
back to Korea.

1012
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:54,747
No, you’re going home.

1013
01:39:57,041 --> 01:40:00,420
All the boys on this list are going home.

1014
01:40:01,629 --> 01:40:05,466
- Where is your home?
- That house by the canal.

1015
01:40:06,593 --> 01:40:09,762
- I mean your real home.
- That house by the canal.

1016
01:40:09,888 --> 01:40:11,931
Yeah, all right.

1017
01:40:13,641 --> 01:40:18,229
I’ve taken all the insubordination
from you I intend to.

1018
01:40:18,354 --> 01:40:21,232
Now, you listen to me, wise guy.

1019
01:40:21,357 --> 01:40:25,904
That house by the canal
is off limits from now on.

1020
01:40:27,113 --> 01:40:29,741
Whole street’s off limits.

1021
01:40:29,866 --> 01:40:32,577
Do you want a court martial?

1022
01:40:32,702 --> 01:40:34,954
Does that mean I could stay in Japan?

1023
01:40:35,079 --> 01:40:39,417
You’re shipping outta here on Thursday.
And don’t you try to help him.

1024
01:40:41,753 --> 01:40:47,217
Remember that house by the canal
is off limits to all personnel.

1025
01:40:48,968 --> 01:40:53,014
Would you tell me just exactly
what you mean by that last remark?

1026
01:40:53,139 --> 01:40:56,476
That’s all I’m prepared
to say at the minute.

1027
01:40:56,601 --> 01:40:59,354
Except you watch your step.

1028
01:41:04,192 --> 01:41:08,446
I don’t know what else to tell you,
General. I’ve known this boy a long time.

1029
01:41:08,571 --> 01:41:13,409
If he has to go back without Katsumi,
he’s gonna be in trouble.

1030
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:16,246
That’s about it. That’s it.

1031
01:41:16,371 --> 01:41:18,915
- What about his wife?
- I don’t know.

1032
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,708
And the baby?

1033
01:41:22,752 --> 01:41:27,632
So the army lets them get married and
then forces them to desert their wives.

1034
01:41:27,757 --> 01:41:30,552
That’s not fair, Eileen.

1035
01:41:30,677 --> 01:41:34,180
A boy away from home
for the first time, lonesome,

1036
01:41:34,305 --> 01:41:36,891
often falls in love
with the first girl he touches,

1037
01:41:37,016 --> 01:41:40,019
in most cases with a girl from the streets.

1038
01:41:40,144 --> 01:41:46,234
It’s up to the service in some measure
to be fathers and mothers to these boys

1039
01:41:46,359 --> 01:41:49,320
and try to head off these marriages.

1040
01:41:49,445 --> 01:41:51,864
But after they’re married,
why send them home?

1041
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:55,660
He’s being transferred to a new
duty station, along with many others.

1042
01:41:55,743 --> 01:42:00,582
Don’t ask me the reasons for changes
of duty. There are thousands of them.

1043
01:42:00,707 --> 01:42:04,711
But Lloyd said most of the men on this list
are married to Japanese girls.

1044
01:42:04,836 --> 01:42:09,883
- That can’t be just a coincidence.
- Why not? It could easily be.

1045
01:42:10,008 --> 01:42:15,638
Frankly, with some of these men,
I think they might welcome the transfer.

1046
01:42:15,763 --> 01:42:17,599
Why’s that, sir?

1047
01:42:17,724 --> 01:42:21,227
There have been unfortunate aftermaths
to many of these marriages.

1048
01:42:21,352 --> 01:42:23,813
Recriminations, regrets.

1049
01:42:25,148 --> 01:42:29,819
A boy gets married impulsively, then feels
caught, doesn’t know how to get out of it.

1050
01:42:29,944 --> 01:42:34,908
Change of duty gives them both
a chance to think it over, to cool off.

1051
01:42:35,033 --> 01:42:40,330
I don’t mean to imply that’s the reason
these men are being transferred but...

1052
01:42:40,455 --> 01:42:46,294
well, the whole thing’s a messy business.

1053
01:42:48,213 --> 01:42:52,842
General Webster, there is no regret
in the case of Kelly and Katsumi.

1054
01:42:52,967 --> 01:42:55,178
You can have my word on that.

1055
01:42:55,303 --> 01:43:01,768
Lloyd, three officers came to me today
with identical requests for their men.

1056
01:43:01,893 --> 01:43:06,147
It’s not our policy to interfere with
decisions made by commanding officers.

1057
01:43:06,272 --> 01:43:12,237
The basic structure of the military service
would collapse if we did things like that.

1058
01:43:12,362 --> 01:43:15,949
Your father would understand that,
even if you don’t.

1059
01:43:16,074 --> 01:43:23,414
You’re asking me to make an exception of
Kelly when I’ve refused these other men?

1060
01:43:23,539 --> 01:43:26,292
I am gonna ask you to do that, sir.

1061
01:43:27,752 --> 01:43:32,715
You made an exception of me
when you brought me from Korea.

1062
01:43:33,633 --> 01:43:37,554
I’m afraid it’s a hopeless situation, Lloyd.

1063
01:43:42,058 --> 01:43:44,102
Well...

1064
01:43:45,395 --> 01:43:48,356
That’s the end of Joe Kelly.

1065
01:43:48,481 --> 01:43:51,943
You told me yourself that Kelly’s
past record was against him.

1066
01:43:52,068 --> 01:43:53,903
I couldn’t even use that.

1067
01:43:54,028 --> 01:43:56,739
Why does this mean
so much to you, Lloyd?

1068
01:43:58,783 --> 01:44:03,288
Kelly’s from my outfit, Mrs. Webster,
I was his best man,

1069
01:44:03,413 --> 01:44:07,500
and I’m planning to marry
a Japanese girl myself.

1070
01:44:11,129 --> 01:44:16,050
Come into the other room, Eileen. This is
something for your father to handle.

1071
01:44:16,175 --> 01:44:20,555
No, Mrs. Webster. I don’t think
this is anything for anybody to handle.

1072
01:44:26,352 --> 01:44:28,396
I’m sorry, Eileen.

1073
01:44:33,234 --> 01:44:36,195
Mrs. Webster. Good afternoon.

1074
01:44:42,952 --> 01:44:47,957
I don’t think I’ll ever love anyone again
as much as I love Lloyd.

1075
01:44:48,082 --> 01:44:51,836
But I’ll tell you something
that’s rather ironic.

1076
01:44:51,961 --> 01:44:55,256
I once asked Lloyd
if he ever felt like grabbing me

1077
01:44:55,381 --> 01:44:59,510
and hauling me off to a shack somewhere.

1078
01:44:59,636 --> 01:45:04,849
That’s just what he’s done, isn’t it?
Only it’s with somebody else.

1079
01:45:04,974 --> 01:45:08,186
Don’t go out, Eileen. Stay and talk.

1080
01:45:08,311 --> 01:45:12,398
I’m sorry, Mother. There’s only one
person I’d like to talk to at the moment.

1081
01:45:12,523 --> 01:45:15,485
And, oddly enough, he’s Japanese.

1082
01:45:19,614 --> 01:45:23,076
- Ace, I’ve been waiting for you.
- Kelly, listen.

1083
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:27,872
I just came from General Webster’s
house. There’s a whole big mess there.

1084
01:45:27,997 --> 01:45:33,002
- No good, huh?
- No. He didn’t go for it.

1085
01:45:33,127 --> 01:45:37,382
Matter of fact, I think
I even messed it up a little.

1086
01:45:37,507 --> 01:45:39,592
That figures.

1087
01:45:39,717 --> 01:45:41,844
Did you tell Katsumi yet?

1088
01:45:43,304 --> 01:45:45,640
I’m chickening out fast.

1089
01:45:45,765 --> 01:45:49,477
Besides, she’s got her heart set
on something she planned for us tonight.

1090
01:45:49,602 --> 01:45:55,066
Wants us to take the train over to Osaka
and meet the girls at the puppet show.

1091
01:45:55,191 --> 01:45:57,235
Why spoil it?

1092
01:45:58,987 --> 01:46:03,449
Maybe I’ll tell her late tonight
when we’re alone.

1093
01:46:03,575 --> 01:46:07,954
Listen, Kelly, don’t give up on it.
I think there’s gonna be a way out of it.

1094
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:10,540
You think so? I don’t.

1095
01:46:12,542 --> 01:46:15,295
- I’ll see you, Ace.
- Kelly-san.

1096
01:46:16,421 --> 01:46:20,341
Tell Katsumi we’ll be there with bells.

1097
01:46:20,466 --> 01:46:22,510
Were you able to help?

1098
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:28,433
- No.
- How terrible.

1099
01:46:33,021 --> 01:46:36,441
I know it’s hard, honey,
but it’s not gonna last long.

1100
01:46:36,566 --> 01:46:41,321
The army’s gotta change that law
next year, or the next one.

1101
01:46:41,446 --> 01:46:44,532
It just has to be. I’m sure of it.

1102
01:46:46,451 --> 01:46:51,205
And, in fact, I’m so sure of it
that I went downtown today

1103
01:46:51,331 --> 01:46:56,628
and I signed some papers here that mean
that you and I are gonna get married.

1104
01:46:59,505 --> 01:47:02,884
- What’s the matter?
- We never spoke of marriage.

1105
01:47:03,009 --> 01:47:06,512
I know we didn’t, darling.
I know we didn’t.

1106
01:47:06,638 --> 01:47:13,436
I’ve been going round and round with that
every day for a long time.

1107
01:47:13,561 --> 01:47:18,149
I didn’t feel I could
speak about it until now.

1108
01:47:18,274 --> 01:47:20,318
But now I can.

1109
01:47:21,569 --> 01:47:24,906
Now, of course, I won’t be able
to take you back to America,

1110
01:47:25,031 --> 01:47:29,202
but they’re bound to change
that ridiculous law soon.

1111
01:47:29,327 --> 01:47:32,705
Until then I’m gonna stay here with you.

1112
01:47:34,207 --> 01:47:37,210
I’m not stuck in the air force. I can resign.

1113
01:47:37,335 --> 01:47:42,882
Course, I’m not trained to do
anything else, but I’d find something.

1114
01:47:44,133 --> 01:47:46,761
We never spoke of marriage.

1115
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:51,391
I know we didn’t, darling,
but we’re speaking of it now.

1116
01:47:58,856 --> 01:48:02,318
Do you remember
the first night we talked?

1117
01:48:02,443 --> 01:48:07,198
I said there would be danger
of weakness when it is over.

1118
01:48:09,701 --> 01:48:12,537
Over? What are you talking about?

1119
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:21,504
I’m tempted. With you, I could become
and woman and a mother,

1120
01:48:21,629 --> 01:48:23,673
and I could love you.

1121
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,427
That’s right.

1122
01:48:27,552 --> 01:48:30,221
Do you think I haven’t thought about it?

1123
01:48:30,346 --> 01:48:35,685
Do you think I want to become a lonely
old woman who teaches dancing,

1124
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:38,271
now that I have known you?

1125
01:48:39,772 --> 01:48:42,358
But it is no good.

1126
01:48:42,483 --> 01:48:48,156
- You must know it too.
- No. I don’t know anything of the kind.

1127
01:48:49,449 --> 01:48:53,077
The way you talk about
leaving the air force,

1128
01:48:53,202 --> 01:48:58,833
finding some pitiful way of earning living,
just to be here with your Japanese wife.

1129
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:01,419
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1130
01:49:04,255 --> 01:49:09,135
I think we’re too far into this thing
to be talking like that.

1131
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:13,014
Matsubayashi has been kind to me, Lloyd.

1132
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:17,727
- I am obligated to them.
- No, you ain’t. No, no.

1133
01:49:17,852 --> 01:49:19,938
You are obligated to me.

1134
01:49:21,272 --> 01:49:23,399
They are my life.

1135
01:49:23,524 --> 01:49:27,195
I would bring shame to them, disgrace.

1136
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,447
Lloyd, you know what I mean.

1137
01:49:29,572 --> 01:49:33,243
Yeah, I think I’m beginning
to know what you mean.

1138
01:49:33,368 --> 01:49:37,038
I think you mean you simply don’t
love me enough to go on through with it.

1139
01:49:37,163 --> 01:49:41,834
That’s what you mean, don’t you? Why
don’t you just come on out and say it?

1140
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,003
It is not what I mean.

1141
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:54,472
I’m leaving for Tokyo in six days.
Matsubayashi are sending me.

1142
01:49:54,597 --> 01:49:56,808
You what?

1143
01:49:58,476 --> 01:50:02,814
With another troupe.
They have found out about us.

1144
01:50:03,898 --> 01:50:07,860
Any other girl they would have dismissed,
but because they like me,

1145
01:50:07,986 --> 01:50:12,574
because they feel I am important to them,
they are being lenient.

1146
01:50:13,616 --> 01:50:16,869
Well, I’m not gonna be lenient with you.

1147
01:50:16,995 --> 01:50:22,208
I want you to tell me why Matsubayashi
means more to you than I do.

1148
01:50:24,544 --> 01:50:30,174
Lloyd, there is something about myself
I have not told you.

1149
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:33,553
I have no right to marry anyone.

1150
01:50:33,678 --> 01:50:36,806
My father was very poor.

1151
01:50:36,931 --> 01:50:42,270
To save his other children,
he was forced to sell one of his daughters.

1152
01:50:43,855 --> 01:50:48,568
The man from
the houses of Yoshiwara came to him.

1153
01:50:48,693 --> 01:50:54,115
Because I was the oldest,
he agreed I should go with him.

1154
01:50:56,492 --> 01:50:59,162
Your father sold you?

1155
01:50:59,287 --> 01:51:06,461
Yes, but I was saved from starting this life
by my best friend, Fumiko-san.

1156
01:51:09,297 --> 01:51:12,050
Her father paid money to free me.

1157
01:51:13,259 --> 01:51:16,429
Then she brought me to Matsubayashi.

1158
01:51:19,182 --> 01:51:25,688
There I not only earned my living,
I brought honor back to my family.

1159
01:51:28,775 --> 01:51:31,945
Matsubayashi has been kind to me.

1160
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:34,656
They have trusted me.

1161
01:51:35,531 --> 01:51:40,286
I cannot leave them.
I cannot marry anyone.

1162
01:51:44,249 --> 01:51:46,292
Don’t you understand?

1163
01:51:53,174 --> 01:51:55,218
I don’t know.

1164
01:51:56,344 --> 01:51:59,847
I don’t know what to think.

1165
01:52:00,974 --> 01:52:06,813
I’ll kill you! You ever do anything like this
and I’ll kill you, you understand?

1166
01:52:06,938 --> 01:52:11,901
- Wait a minute. Just take it easy, now.
- Ace, look at this.

1167
01:52:13,194 --> 01:52:15,321
- It fell out of her bag.
- What is it?

1168
01:52:15,446 --> 01:52:20,243
She was gonna have it done tomorrow,
by that quack doctor down by the docks.

1169
01:52:20,368 --> 01:52:24,330
For eight bucks he slashes her eyelids
and sews ‘em back up again.

1170
01:52:24,455 --> 01:52:29,752
Lots of these stupid little jerks
have it done. She was gonna surprise me.

1171
01:52:29,878 --> 01:52:35,300
Then... then I have good eyes,
I fool everybody.

1172
01:52:35,425 --> 01:52:39,262
I look American, like Joe.

1173
01:52:39,387 --> 01:52:44,851
Hana-ogi, will you tell that stupid dame
I love her the way she is?

1174
01:52:44,976 --> 01:52:49,480
I don’t want her changed. Will you tell her
I love her mouth and her nose

1175
01:52:49,606 --> 01:52:53,484
and her ears and her eyes
just the way they are?

1176
01:52:53,610 --> 01:52:58,907
Tell her if she ever does
anything like that, I’ll...

1177
01:52:59,032 --> 01:53:02,827
I want him be proud of me.

1178
01:53:02,952 --> 01:53:04,662
I’m sorry.

1179
01:53:04,787 --> 01:53:07,707
If you want him to be proud of you,
quit this stuff.

1180
01:53:07,832 --> 01:53:13,671
You’re making him very unhappy.
Tell him you’re not gonna do it any more.

1181
01:53:13,796 --> 01:53:16,507
- Tell him that.
- Joe.

1182
01:53:18,426 --> 01:53:20,220
I’m so sorry.

1183
01:53:23,348 --> 01:53:26,226
We’re gonna forget about that.

1184
01:53:26,351 --> 01:53:31,856
I thought we were gonna have a fish fry,
have some fun and dancing and yelling.

1185
01:53:31,981 --> 01:53:34,734
And what do I find?
So what’s gonna happen to us?

1186
01:53:34,859 --> 01:53:37,028
- Puppet show.
- We had a surprise.

1187
01:53:37,153 --> 01:53:40,281
- You like?
- Sure I do. I’ve been looking forward to it.

1188
01:53:40,406 --> 01:53:43,660
- Everybody tonight?
- Yeah.

1189
01:53:48,498 --> 01:53:50,542
We will be late.

1190
01:53:58,049 --> 01:53:59,592
Look.

1191
01:53:59,717 --> 01:54:02,554
The lover is leaving the city.

1192
01:54:02,679 --> 01:54:04,722
Walk to the wood.

1193
01:54:42,093 --> 01:54:45,847
Lloyd, don’t think of anything now.

1194
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:49,142
Watch the play.

1195
01:54:49,267 --> 01:54:51,311
It’s a tender story.

1196
01:54:59,611 --> 01:55:03,531
When gong sound, it is dawn,

1197
01:55:03,656 --> 01:55:08,661
and then she will bind her body.

1198
01:55:09,621 --> 01:55:11,122
Bind her body?

1199
01:55:11,247 --> 01:55:17,503
So that she will not fall in an ugly position
of dishonor when she dies.

1200
01:55:17,629 --> 01:55:20,590
- When she dies?
- Yes.

1201
01:55:38,024 --> 01:55:44,239
It is custom for lovers to die together
when they can no longer face life.

1202
01:55:54,332 --> 01:55:56,793
It is so beautiful.

1203
01:55:57,544 --> 01:56:00,880
Beautiful? They’re gonna die, aren’t they?

1204
01:56:01,005 --> 01:56:05,718
They will live in another world
on a beautiful lake,

1205
01:56:05,843 --> 01:56:09,055
floating always together.

1206
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,224
Like water lily.

1207
01:56:13,893 --> 01:56:15,937
Sure.

1208
01:57:37,268 --> 01:57:41,064
" Kelly-san! Kelly-san! Kelly-san!

1209
01:57:50,657 --> 01:57:55,078
Something about soldiers
going through the house.

1210
01:57:58,665 --> 01:58:01,960
- That’s the MPs, boy.
- What happened? What’s wrong?

1211
01:58:02,085 --> 01:58:04,837
- What happened?
- Get in the car.

1212
01:58:06,673 --> 01:58:11,052
- Please tell me.
- Go to Matsubayashi. I’ll tell you later.

1213
01:58:11,177 --> 01:58:12,178
Matsubayashi.

1214
01:58:15,306 --> 01:58:17,600
Hey, Ed, look.

1215
01:58:32,991 --> 01:58:35,034
Look at that.

1216
01:58:37,908 --> 01:58:41,077
- You’re Major Gruver, aren’t you?
- That’s right.

1217
01:58:41,203 --> 01:58:43,997
You’ll have to come with us.
General Webster’s orders.

1218
01:58:44,122 --> 01:58:46,500
What right do you have
to board up this house?

1219
01:58:46,625 --> 01:58:48,919
He won’t be needing it. He’s shipping out.

1220
01:58:49,044 --> 01:58:50,837
Joe!

1221
01:58:50,962 --> 01:58:53,006
Come on, Major.

1222
01:58:54,925 --> 01:58:57,385
You’ll hear from me, Kelly.

1223
01:59:10,732 --> 01:59:13,610
Come on, kid.
We’ll get in through the garden.

1224
01:59:13,735 --> 01:59:16,530
I got something to tell you.

1225
01:59:39,511 --> 01:59:42,931
You were seen in public with her tonight,
violating orders.

1226
01:59:43,056 --> 01:59:46,643
This has given me the right
to put you under arrest.

1227
01:59:46,768 --> 01:59:50,355
And for your own sake,
I think I better do it.

1228
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:53,608
Well? Have you anything to say?

1229
01:59:55,652 --> 02:00:02,617
Just as soon as I’m out of this, I’m gonna
be married and have a house of my own.

1230
02:00:02,742 --> 02:00:07,038
I’m afraid not.
I’m sorry, Lloyd, but it’s all settled.

1231
02:00:07,164 --> 02:00:10,792
The supervisor of the Matsubayashi
came to see me tonight.

1232
02:00:10,917 --> 02:00:16,173
The girl goes to Tokyo and you fly to
Randolph Field the day after tomorrow.

1233
02:00:16,298 --> 02:00:19,092
Here are your orders.

1234
02:00:19,217 --> 02:00:23,221
Until that time, you’re under house arrest.

1235
02:00:23,346 --> 02:00:28,185
You’re not to leave your quarters
until further notice.

1236
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:35,525
I’m doing this because I feel
you’re not responsible at the moment.

1237
02:00:35,650 --> 02:00:39,237
After all, I’ve known your father for years.

1238
02:00:43,992 --> 02:00:46,453
Well, that’s all.

1239
02:01:21,446 --> 02:01:23,490
Mike.

1240
02:01:23,615 --> 02:01:26,201
- Did you see her?
- I couldn’t get near the place.

1241
02:01:26,326 --> 02:01:29,538
They’ve really clamped down.
I couldn’t even see Fumiko-san.

1242
02:01:29,663 --> 02:01:32,541
I’ve got to see her.
I’m being shipped out tomorrow.

1243
02:01:32,666 --> 02:01:35,252
- Major Gruver.
- What is it?

1244
02:01:35,377 --> 02:01:38,463
- Would you do something for us?
- What do you want?

1245
02:01:38,588 --> 02:01:41,675
- Airman Kelly’s disappeared.
- That’s impossible.

1246
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:44,261
- I was with him just last night.
- We know.

1247
02:01:44,386 --> 02:01:49,599
A special plane came through and
Colonel Crawford told us to get him on it.

1248
02:01:49,724 --> 02:01:54,855
I took him to the airport at 12.50. When
the plane took off, Kelly wasn’t on it.

1249
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:59,776
- We figured you might know where he is.
- His house has been boarded up.

1250
02:01:59,901 --> 02:02:00,902
We know.

1251
02:02:01,027 --> 02:02:04,906
Neighbors won’t talk to us.
We figure maybe they’re hiding him.

1252
02:02:05,031 --> 02:02:08,410
They’ll talk with you, Major.
Would you help us?

1253
02:02:08,535 --> 02:02:12,455
Would you give me one good reason
why I should?

1254
02:02:13,415 --> 02:02:16,835
We figured we’d give him a break.
We haven’t reported him yet.

1255
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:23,300
If we get him on another plane, we might
not have to turn him in for desertion.

1256
02:02:23,425 --> 02:02:25,468
- Desertion?
- Yes, sir.

1257
02:02:29,014 --> 02:02:31,057
Well...

1258
02:02:31,892 --> 02:02:35,520
- I’ll go with you in a minute.
- Major.

1259
02:02:35,645 --> 02:02:38,023
The neighbors won’t talk
if they see an MP.

1260
02:02:38,148 --> 02:02:41,109
- I’ll go with him.
- Thank you, sir.

1261
02:03:41,461 --> 02:03:43,505
Kelly?

1262
02:03:45,966 --> 02:03:48,009
It’s Gruver out here.

1263
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:52,264
I think he’s in there.

1264
02:03:53,723 --> 02:03:55,767
Kelly?

1265
02:03:56,977 --> 02:03:59,020
I’m goin’ on in.

1266
02:04:12,784 --> 02:04:14,828
Kelly?

1267
02:04:21,293 --> 02:04:23,336
Kelly?

1268
02:04:29,134 --> 02:04:31,803
Kelly? You in there?

1269
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:57,454
Oh, my God!

1270
02:05:00,999 --> 02:05:03,043
Oh, my...

1271
02:05:23,230 --> 02:05:25,273
Oh...

1272
02:05:31,112 --> 02:05:33,365
I’ll call the police, Ace.

1273
02:05:50,841 --> 02:05:52,884
Oh, God!

1274
02:06:28,253 --> 02:06:31,423
" Sayonara, Kelly-san.

1275
02:06:34,885 --> 02:06:38,847
Sayonara, Katsumi-san.

1276
02:06:48,773 --> 02:06:53,445
Sayonara, my Lloyd-san.

1277
02:07:29,523 --> 02:07:32,901
" Go home! Go home!

1278
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:43,328
Ace, there’s no police around.
We better get outta here.

1279
02:07:44,037 --> 02:07:46,039
Hey, look.

1280
02:07:53,338 --> 02:07:56,007
Doesn’t look too good, boy.

1281
02:08:01,555 --> 02:08:03,431
Come on, take it easy.

1282
02:08:36,673 --> 02:08:38,800
We’re gettin’ help, Ace.

1283
02:08:51,938 --> 02:08:55,317
- You OK, boy?
- I’m fine. You all right?

1284
02:08:55,442 --> 02:08:56,902
Yeah.

1285
02:08:57,027 --> 02:09:01,531
I’m gonna... I want you
to take care of everything, will you?

1286
02:09:01,656 --> 02:09:04,159
Yeah, I’ll get it.

1287
02:09:04,284 --> 02:09:06,328
I’ll see you later.

1288
02:09:53,542 --> 02:09:55,836
- Where’s Hana-ogi?
- Hana-ogi is not here.

1289
02:09:55,961 --> 02:09:59,172
- I know she’s here.
- She is on her way Tokyo.

1290
02:09:59,297 --> 02:10:02,843
- She wasn’t going till next week.
- She went today.

1291
02:10:02,968 --> 02:10:08,223
- I don’t believe you.
- Major Gruver! It’s forbidden to go in.

1292
02:10:55,187 --> 02:10:57,230
Hana-ogi?

1293
02:11:06,865 --> 02:11:10,118
Hana-ogi? Hana-ogi?

1294
02:11:10,702 --> 02:11:12,746
Hana-ogi?

1295
02:11:22,339 --> 02:11:24,382
Hana-ogi?

1296
02:11:30,889 --> 02:11:33,183
- Gruver-san!
- Where’s Hana-ogi?

1297
02:11:33,266 --> 02:11:35,101
- She’s gone.
- Where’s her room?

1298
02:11:35,227 --> 02:11:38,730
- She’s gone.
- Listen, where’s her room?

1299
02:11:38,855 --> 02:11:40,732
Come here.

1300
02:11:43,652 --> 02:11:46,196
Hana-ogi really gone, Major.

1301
02:11:46,321 --> 02:11:48,365
I don’t believe you.

1302
02:11:49,032 --> 02:11:51,076
Hana-ogi?

1303
02:11:56,748 --> 02:12:01,628
I give you my word.
You go now too, Major.

1304
02:12:01,753 --> 02:12:04,089
It’s over.

1305
02:12:04,214 --> 02:12:07,050
Leave me alone a minute, will you?

1306
02:12:23,024 --> 02:12:26,570
The hoodlums who attacked you
weren’t all your Japanese neighbors.

1307
02:12:26,695 --> 02:12:29,447
They were troublemakers
sent to your street

1308
02:12:29,573 --> 02:12:32,409
to create an incident specifically with you.

1309
02:12:32,534 --> 02:12:35,704
If you’re important to those who hate us,

1310
02:12:35,829 --> 02:12:39,332
don’t you see
how important you are to us?

1311
02:12:41,418 --> 02:12:44,713
Do you understand any of this, Lloyd?

1312
02:12:46,506 --> 02:12:48,633
I know how you feel.

1313
02:12:48,758 --> 02:12:50,218
It was...

1314
02:12:50,343 --> 02:12:56,224
It was dreadful about your friend Kelly
and... and his wife.

1315
02:12:58,310 --> 02:13:00,770
It must be hard to take.

1316
02:13:02,856 --> 02:13:07,277
And I... I hate to tell you something else,

1317
02:13:07,402 --> 02:13:11,698
because it’s almost too grotesque...

1318
02:13:14,618 --> 02:13:17,621
almost unforgivable
in your eyes, I imagine.

1319
02:13:17,746 --> 02:13:24,544
I got word today that there’s a law
being passed in a month or two

1320
02:13:24,669 --> 02:13:28,131
that will make it possible
for men like Kelly

1321
02:13:28,256 --> 02:13:32,469
to take their Japanese brides
back to the States.

1322
02:13:36,598 --> 02:13:42,270
- That can’t be true, General.
- Well, it happens to be true, Lloyd.

1323
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:52,155
Listen, how do you get the guts
to come here and tell me that?

1324
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:56,034
It takes time to get laws passed, Lloyd.

1325
02:13:56,159 --> 02:14:00,872
And a lot of people have died in this world
needlessly waiting for them.

1326
02:14:00,997 --> 02:14:05,126
It’s harder to take
when it hits you personally.

1327
02:14:07,587 --> 02:14:09,589
Lloyd...

1328
02:14:09,714 --> 02:14:12,384
You’re lost. You’re confused.

1329
02:14:13,885 --> 02:14:17,764
Don’t you think it’s time you got back
to the mainstream of your life?

1330
02:14:17,889 --> 02:14:22,435
Back to your roots,
what you were born for and raised for.

1331
02:14:22,561 --> 02:14:29,693
You’ll feel better about everything when
you get back home, back to your work.

1332
02:14:29,818 --> 02:14:32,737
I appreciate you coming over, General.

1333
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:16,531
Take me to the airport, Mike.

1334
02:15:22,245 --> 02:15:24,414
That must be him.

1335
02:15:24,539 --> 02:15:30,212
- Hold it so we can get a picture, General.
- Where would you like me?

1336
02:15:30,712 --> 02:15:32,756
Smile, please.

1337
02:15:38,428 --> 02:15:42,432
- Bill, isn’t that Ace Gruver?
- Looks like him.

1338
02:15:45,185 --> 02:15:47,395
Sir.

1339
02:15:47,521 --> 02:15:49,856
Aren’t you Major Gruver? Ace Gruver?

1340
02:15:49,981 --> 02:15:52,692
- That’s right.
- We’re from the "Stars and Stripes."

1341
02:15:52,818 --> 02:15:57,364
- What are you doing in Tokyo?
- I’m just passing through, boys.

1342
02:15:57,489 --> 02:16:00,909
- Just seeing the sights, huh?
- That’s right. I’m in a hurry.

1343
02:16:01,034 --> 02:16:05,872
- Do you mind if I excuse myself? Sorry.
- You’re excused.

1344
02:17:54,439 --> 02:17:56,691
It’s Gruver! Gruver-san!

1345
02:18:22,926 --> 02:18:24,302
Lloyd-san.

1346
02:18:25,887 --> 02:18:27,722
Hello.

1347
02:18:46,616 --> 02:18:48,952
Hello, Hana-ogi.

1348
02:18:51,246 --> 02:18:54,916
I’m goin’ back to America on Friday,

1349
02:18:55,041 --> 02:19:00,088
and I probably won’t
get back in Japan again.

1350
02:19:03,383 --> 02:19:06,261
And before I go, there was just...

1351
02:19:07,637 --> 02:19:10,307
just one thing I wanted to know.

1352
02:19:12,767 --> 02:19:16,062
You remember one time you said to me...

1353
02:19:18,106 --> 02:19:24,237
that you could love me
and be a wife and a mother?

1354
02:19:25,739 --> 02:19:28,158
I remember.

1355
02:19:29,993 --> 02:19:32,037
You said that since you’d known me,

1356
02:19:32,162 --> 02:19:37,751
you’d been afraid of being
a lonely old woman teaching dancing.

1357
02:19:37,876 --> 02:19:40,712
Remember that?

1358
02:19:40,837 --> 02:19:43,089
I remember.

1359
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:48,053
Did you mean that
when you said it, Hana-ogi?

1360
02:19:49,012 --> 02:19:52,891
I meant it. It is already happening.

1361
02:19:53,016 --> 02:19:57,562
Life has gone out of my work, out of me.

1362
02:19:57,687 --> 02:20:00,565
Lloyd, please go now.

1363
02:20:00,690 --> 02:20:03,985
This will only bring pain and trouble.

1364
02:20:06,238 --> 02:20:10,283
Hana-ogi, you and I
are gonna have more trouble

1365
02:20:10,408 --> 02:20:13,036
than we ever thought
of having in our whole lives

1366
02:20:13,161 --> 02:20:17,374
unless you are absolutely
honest with yourself.

1367
02:20:18,708 --> 02:20:23,255
Please, Lloyd,
can’t we talk about this later?

1368
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:29,386
No. There’s isn’t gonna be any later.
There’s only gonna be right now.

1369
02:20:31,346 --> 02:20:33,890
Excuse me, mother. Excuse me.

1370
02:20:37,978 --> 02:20:41,022
I must return this robe.

1371
02:20:41,147 --> 02:20:45,819
I wanna know -
do you love me or don’t you?

1372
02:20:47,028 --> 02:20:52,784
Because if you don’t, then I’m gonna
have to find a way to live with it.

1373
02:20:52,909 --> 02:20:55,537
- And if you do...
- Please, Lloyd.

1374
02:20:57,330 --> 02:20:59,791
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1375
02:21:03,003 --> 02:21:07,424
I don’t want you to tell me
anything more or anything less

1376
02:21:07,549 --> 02:21:11,178
than you feel
in the very deepest part of you.

1377
02:21:11,303 --> 02:21:17,809
Because what you answer to me now
is gonna affect us for the rest of our lives.

1378
02:21:18,685 --> 02:21:22,606
Do you love me, Hana-ogi,
or don’t you love me?

1379
02:21:25,442 --> 02:21:28,278
I’m so frightened and confused.

1380
02:21:28,403 --> 02:21:32,282
I cannot think.
I cannot even understand your thinking.

1381
02:21:32,407 --> 02:21:38,830
I’m not thinking. For the first time
in my life I’m not thinking and I don’t care.

1382
02:21:38,955 --> 02:21:40,999
But we must do the right thing.

1383
02:21:41,124 --> 02:21:43,627
What are you talking about,
the right thing?

1384
02:21:43,752 --> 02:21:46,838
We been wasting two good lives
trying to do the right thing -

1385
02:21:46,963 --> 02:21:50,842
the right thing for Matsubayashi,
the right thing for my father,

1386
02:21:50,967 --> 02:21:55,055
the right thing for the military,
the right thing for Japanese tradition,

1387
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:58,350
the right thing for the great white race.

1388
02:21:58,475 --> 02:22:03,939
- But we have duties and obligations.
- We do have duties and obligations.

1389
02:22:04,064 --> 02:22:07,275
The first obligation we have
is to love each other,

1390
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:11,154
to become man and wife
and raise some clean, sweet children,

1391
02:22:11,279 --> 02:22:14,241
and give them the very best
that we know how.

1392
02:22:14,366 --> 02:22:19,746
And if we don’t meet that obligation,
we ain’t gonna be any good to anybody.

1393
02:22:19,871 --> 02:22:24,709
We live in different worlds,
come from different races.

1394
02:22:26,837 --> 02:22:30,340
Honey, I want you to be my wife.

1395
02:22:32,008 --> 02:22:35,887
But what would happen to our children?
What would they be?

1396
02:22:36,012 --> 02:22:40,016
What would they be?
They’d be half-Japanese, half-American.

1397
02:22:40,141 --> 02:22:43,019
They’d be half-yellow and half-white.

1398
02:22:43,144 --> 02:22:46,022
They’d be half you, they’d be half me.

1399
02:22:46,148 --> 02:22:49,609
That’s all they’re gonna be.

1400
02:23:01,663 --> 02:23:05,041
Hana-ogi, I want you
to come with me now.

1401
02:23:06,251 --> 02:23:11,131
I want you to come with me now
down to the American consulate.

1402
02:23:11,256 --> 02:23:14,301
Here in Tokyo. We’re gonna start
filling out those papers.

1403
02:23:14,426 --> 02:23:20,223
We’ve only got a few days to get
this whole thing done and out of the way.

1404
02:23:28,398 --> 02:23:30,442
Will you come?

1405
02:23:40,827 --> 02:23:43,497
I’m gonna wait for you outside.

1406
02:24:13,401 --> 02:24:15,570
Did I tell you they’d be here?

1407
02:24:15,695 --> 02:24:20,283
- Look at this crowd.
- Look who’s here. Our rivals.

1408
02:24:20,408 --> 02:24:26,206
You guys heard about it too?
No secrets. No secrets in this country.

1409
02:24:31,503 --> 02:24:34,297
Major, what a coincidence.

1410
02:24:34,422 --> 02:24:36,675
You got a story for us, sir?

1411
02:24:37,634 --> 02:24:39,803
No, as a matter of fact, I don’t.

1412
02:24:39,928 --> 02:24:43,723
- You’re not gonna try to deny it, are you?
- Deny what?

1413
02:24:43,849 --> 02:24:46,476
The story.
Why won’t you give us the story?

1414
02:24:46,601 --> 02:24:50,021
- You’re big news now, sir.
- I don’t know what you’re talking about.

1415
02:24:52,566 --> 02:24:55,735
Here’s Hana-ogi. Maybe she’ll talk.

1416
02:25:12,210 --> 02:25:16,173
Come on, Hana-ogi.
That’s not fair. What did you say?

1417
02:25:16,298 --> 02:25:21,720
It is very difficult for a Japanese woman
to speak in public.

1418
02:25:21,845 --> 02:25:24,681
I have never done so.

1419
02:25:24,806 --> 02:25:27,350
But perhaps now it is the time.

1420
02:25:28,768 --> 02:25:33,190
Major Gruver has asked me
to be his... his wife.

1421
02:25:36,902 --> 02:25:42,073
He knows there are many people in
this country who will be disturbed by this.

1422
02:25:42,199 --> 02:25:45,035
I know my people will be shocked too.

1423
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:50,415
But I hope they will learn to understand
and someday approve.

1424
02:25:51,708 --> 02:25:56,588
We are not afraid,
because we know this is right.

1425
02:25:56,713 --> 02:25:59,299
I hope I can continue as a dancer

1426
02:25:59,424 --> 02:26:05,096
and I hope when I am old,
I will be able to teach children to dance.

1427
02:26:06,223 --> 02:26:09,059
My own children.

1428
02:26:09,184 --> 02:26:12,312
Major, the big brass are gonna
yell their heads off.

1429
02:26:12,437 --> 02:26:19,277
The Japanese aren’t gonna like it either.
Have you got anything to say to them, sir?

1430
02:26:19,401 --> 02:26:20,527
Yeah.

1431
02:26:21,870 --> 02:26:24,100
Tell ‘em we said “sayonara”.
