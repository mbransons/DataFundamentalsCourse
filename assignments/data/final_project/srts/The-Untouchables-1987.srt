1
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,920
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

2
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,430
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

3
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,140
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

4
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,690
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

5
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,230
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

6
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,400
Some people say,
reformers here say:

7
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,570
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

8
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,240
What I hope I'm doing, and here's
where your paper's got a point,

9
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,750
is I'm responding to
the will of the people.

10
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,300
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

11
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,300
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

12
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,300
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

13
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,760
I'm a businessman.

14
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,980
Your reputation is that you control
your business through violence.

15
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,820
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

16
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,320
It's all right.

17
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,700
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.

18
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,750
We used to say, "Y ou can get further
with a kind word and a gun"

19
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,040
"than you can
with just a kind word."

20
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,630
And in that neighbourhood
it might've been true.

21
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,420
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

22
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,590
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me

23
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,100
and not by anybody I employ.
Because it's not good business.

24
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,590
<i>Leave us alone down here,</i>
<i>we've got everything we need.</i>

25
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

26
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,230
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

27
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,150
I'm not buyin' any.

28
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,190
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

29
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,240
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

30
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,500
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

31
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,920
Oh, she does?

32
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,290
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

33
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,890
- There you go.
- Thank you.

34
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,390
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

35
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,020
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that...

36
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,770
Hey, Mister! Wait!

37
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,360
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief...

38
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,090
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

39
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,680
I know.

40
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,140
Now it's time to go to work.

41
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,450
You'll make a good first impression.

42
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,290
I love you, Eliot.

43
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,000
Now, shoo.

44
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,430
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

45
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,140
- Mr Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

46
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,680
At the request
of the City of Chicago,

47
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,650
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme

48
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,400
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

49
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,400
Mr Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

50
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,450
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working

51
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,700
with the Chicago Police...

52
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,120
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

53
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,500
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr Ness?

54
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,590
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

55
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,010
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

56
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,630
It is the law of the land.

57
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,600
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

58
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,140
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

59
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,730
Do you have any political ambitions?

60
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,650
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

61
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,280
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

62
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,570
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

63
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,450
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

64
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,910
Mr Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

65
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,080
Are you ready to meet the men?

66
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,500
Yes, I am.

67
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,310
I have one more thing to say.

68
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,440
I know that many of you take a drink.

69
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,520
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

70
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,280
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

71
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,080
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

72
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,870
But it's against the law.

73
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,330
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

74
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,710
Are there any questions?

75
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,470
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had

76
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,810
a man undercover here
for some time now.

77
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,060
We've received word
from this informant

78
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,770
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

79
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,690
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

80
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,370
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

81
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,830
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

82
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,630
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

83
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,210
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

84
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,640
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

85
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,480
- How are we doin'
- Okay.

86
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,950
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

87
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,130
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

88
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,920
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

89
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,010
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,730
A message from my wife.

91
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,230
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

92
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,240
Nice to be married, huh?

93
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,220
Just follow me.

94
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,050
- Oh, God...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

95
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,600
Get 'em up. Drop it.

96
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,390
Damn it, I can't , it'll break.

97
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,980
Mr Ness. Look, I was just...

98
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,230
Geez, I'm sorry.

99
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,990
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

100
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,400
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

101
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,120
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

102
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,540
Okay. Just shut up.

103
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,940
All right now...
Let's do some good!

104
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,330
Hold it right there!

105
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,590
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

106
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,520
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

107
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,520
Preseuski.

108
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,730
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

109
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,860
- Mr Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

110
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,620
Let him through here.

111
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,950
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

112
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,460
- You ready?
- Ready.

113
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,610
Liquor, huh?

114
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,070
Get him out of here.

115
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,370
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

116
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,540
That means you, too.

117
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,260
Christ!

118
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:19,300
Now, what do you think you're doing?

119
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,390
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

120
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,810
Don't you have
more important things to do?

121
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,180
Yeah.

122
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,980
But I'm not doing them right now.

123
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,860
Do we understand each other?

124
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,990
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

125
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,240
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

126
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,370
All right.

127
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,290
Just remember
what we talked about now.

128
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,680
Hey... Wait a minute!

129
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,640
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn citý?

130
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,720
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

131
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,690
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

132
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,020
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

133
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,990
What's your name and unit?

134
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,330
It's right here.

135
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,130
You got a beef?
What is it?

136
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,590
How did you know I had a gun?

137
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,590
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

138
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,310
No.

139
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,600
Are you okay, pal?

140
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,150
I had a rough day on the job.

141
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,860
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

142
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,830
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

143
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,880
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

144
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,210
Here endeth the lesson.

145
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,190
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

146
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,490
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

147
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,660
55 gallons to the barrel.

148
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,260
- It's Eddie.
- <i>Come in, Eddie.</i>

149
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:20,040
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good" .

150
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,670
And then, we bust through...

151
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,260
- Mr Ness?
- Yes?

152
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,810
I came here to thank you.

153
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,430
It was...

154
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,440
..my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

155
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,770
I'm sorry. Please.

156
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,940
I'm ...l'm so sorry.

157
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,950
You see, it's ...because I know
that you have children, too.

158
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,290
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

159
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,210
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

160
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,090
And you do that, now.

161
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,400
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

162
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,780
Come in.

163
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,160
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

164
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,330
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

165
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,750
- Now, how can <i>I help you?</i>
- Just work with me.

166
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,550
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

167
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,640
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

168
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,850
If I'm such a good cop...

169
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,140
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

170
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,270
Do you want to tell me?

171
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,360
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

172
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,320
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

173
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,530
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

174
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,490
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

175
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,040
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

176
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,710
I'm askin' you for help.

177
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,670
Well...that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

178
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,680
Mr Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and...twenty pounds ago.

179
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,610
But...I just think it got...
more important to me...

180
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,530
..to stay alive.

181
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,830
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

182
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,800
<i>That's good, Andy. Let's start up</i>
<i>the thing and take a little ride.</i>

183
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,560
<i>I wanna hear</i>
<i>that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!</i>

184
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,100
- <i>Yeah, let me open the door here.</i>
- <i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

185
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,730
<i>Whoopsy daisy,</i>
<i>pick up the door there, Andy.</i>

186
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,860
<i>Throw it in the back seat.</i>
<i>Now, let me get the thing started.</i>

187
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,110
<i>Yeah, start it up, Andy.</i>

188
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,160
<i>Holy mackerel, Andy!</i>
<i>Listen to that Bearcat motor!</i>

189
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,090
<i>Yeah, it sounds like the bear</i>
<i>is chasin' that cat all round it!</i>

190
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
<i>Andy! She's boilin' over!</i>

191
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,770
- Mr Ness?
- Yes.

192
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,400
Oscar Wallace.

193
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,320
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

194
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,780
- Really?
- Yes.

195
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,700
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr Wallace. Would you excuse me?

196
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,620
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have...

197
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,790
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

198
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,880
And the one I want to try first...
is this.

199
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,550
He has not filed a return since 1926.

200
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,770
- A return...?
- An income tax return.

201
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,770
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,400
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

203
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,610
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...

204
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,910
Would you excuse me?

205
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,660
Please.

206
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,690
Okay. Let's go.

207
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,820
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

208
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,740
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

209
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,460
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

210
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:25,260
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

211
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,430
And then what are you
prepared to do?

212
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,010
If you open the ball
on these people,

213
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,760
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

214
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,140
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

215
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,440
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

216
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,520
Here's how you get Capone:
he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

217
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,490
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

218
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,320
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

219
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,830
Now, do you want to do that?

220
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,750
Are you ready to do that?

221
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,380
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

222
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,840
I have sworn to put this man away,

223
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:14,220
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

224
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,400
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

225
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,780
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr Ness?

226
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,950
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

227
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,210
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

228
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,050
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

229
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,720
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

230
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,430
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

231
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,390
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

232
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Because I swore to uphold the law.

233
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,650
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

234
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,110
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

235
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,410
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

236
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,460
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

237
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,000
Get it off the tree.

238
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,590
Get it off the tree...

239
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,050
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

240
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,430
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

241
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,050
About face!

242
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,020
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr Eliot Ness.

243
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,020
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

244
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,860
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full...

245
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,320
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

246
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,450
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

247
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,080
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

248
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,870
- Good.
- <i>Williamson!</i>

249
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,590
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

250
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,300
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

251
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,930
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and...

252
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,850
To protect and serve...
To protect and...

253
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,230
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

254
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,440
- What I think? I...
- You...

255
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,780
...could help...the force.

256
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,780
- You can help...
- With the force.

257
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,620
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

258
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,710
At ease!

259
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,210
Stone! Out here.

260
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,510
This kid's a prodigy.

261
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,760
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and...

262
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,930
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

263
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,190
Where are you from, Stone?

264
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,780
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

265
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,990
George Stone, that's your name?

266
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,830
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

267
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,370
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

268
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,090
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

269
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,210
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

270
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,050
What's that you said?

271
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,050
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

272
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,100
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

273
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,110
Oh, I like him.

274
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,320
Yeah, I like him, too.

275
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,820
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

276
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,330
Yeah, okay.

277
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,790
Eliot Ness.

278
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,920
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and...

279
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,880
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

280
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,220
What do you think?

281
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,680
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

282
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:33,730
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

283
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,480
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

284
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,490
We need another man.

285
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,910
Mr Ness? This is very interesting.

286
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,200
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu...

287
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,370
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

288
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,620
Carry a gun.

289
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,600
- Jimmy...?
- What?

290
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,480
What the hell are you dressed for?
Hallowe'en?

291
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,520
Shut up. I'm working.

292
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,280
Where? The circus?

293
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,590
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

294
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,890
Liquor raid.

295
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,050
Here?!

296
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,560
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

297
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,730
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

298
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,780
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

299
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,670
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

300
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,840
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

301
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,510
Yes, I do.

302
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,840
Good. Give me that axe.

303
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,520
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

304
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,020
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

305
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,240
- Everybody...
- What are you doin' here?

306
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,200
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

307
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,200
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

308
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,040
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

309
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,710
How do you think he feels now?
Better...or worse?

310
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,890
- What is that?
- What is <i>that?</i>

311
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,270
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

312
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:19,480
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

313
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,150
<i>Il Santo Jude.</i>
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

314
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,070
And policemen.

315
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,780
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

316
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,160
Lost causes, policemen...

317
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,960
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

318
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,000
- You do?
- Yes.

319
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,420
Why?

320
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,260
'To protect the property
and the citizenry...'

321
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,810
Whoa, it's all right.

322
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,520
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

323
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,520
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

324
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,610
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

325
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,440
Anything you say, Mr Ness.

326
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,700
Closer in... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

327
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,000
Life goes on.

328
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:29,220
A man becomes preeminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

329
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,470
Enthusiasms...

330
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,350
Enthusiasms...

331
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,680
What are mine?

332
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,690
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

333
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,150
- Dames!
- Boozin'

334
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,110
Baseball!

335
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,660
A man...

336
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,210
A man stands alone at the plate.

337
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,840
This is the time for what?

338
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,550
For individual achievement.

339
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,260
There he stands alone.

340
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,640
But in the field, what?

341
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,100
Part of a team.

342
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,570
Teamwork...

343
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,990
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

344
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,410
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

345
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,210
If his team don't field...what is he?

346
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,300
You follow me?

347
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,220
No one.

348
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,510
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

349
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,150
I'm goin' out there for myself.

350
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:11,860
But...I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

351
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,360
- Team!
- Team.

352
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,160
Jesus Christ!

353
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,230
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

354
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,820
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

355
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,820
'lf I should die before I wake'

356
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,410
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

357
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,540
- Amen.
- God bless...

358
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,710
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

359
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,920
Amen.

360
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,720
Good night.

361
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,970
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

362
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,020
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

363
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,780
- Where are you going?
- What?

364
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,740
Where are you going?

365
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,790
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

366
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,250
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

367
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,590
And you've still got
some energy left?

368
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,500
Oh, a lot of work.

369
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:59,340
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'

370
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,940
- How are we doin'
- Capone's organisation is diverse.

371
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:21,570
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn

372
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,700
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings...

373
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,540
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

374
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,330
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

375
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,170
...Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs...the list is endless!

376
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,090
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

377
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,300
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show

378
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,640
that any of the 'organisation'
business money is going to him.

379
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:51,060
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

380
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,820
- Mr Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

381
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,110
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...

382
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,200
Yes, I know who you are.

383
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,830
Would you excuse us?

384
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:11,750
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

385
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,170
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

386
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,130
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

387
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,560
What's that?

388
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,520
- What is that?
- Mr Ness, you're an educated man.

389
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,190
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

390
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,200
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

391
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,040
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

392
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,250
Would you come in here, please?

393
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:02,420
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

394
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,840
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag

395
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,680
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

396
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,270
You tell your master
that we must agree to...disagree!

397
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,940
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

398
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:22,740
You fellows are 'untouchable'
is that it? No one can get to you?

399
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,320
You tell Capone...
that I'll see him in hell.

400
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,540
Hey! Nice house!

401
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,580
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

402
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,880
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

403
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,050
Yes.

404
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,510
Nice to have a family.

405
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,930
Yes, it is.

406
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,640
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

407
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,580
Catherine?!

408
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,960
Catherine!

409
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,620
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

410
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,180
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

411
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:39,440
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

412
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,620
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

413
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:56,120
Okay, let's go.

414
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:00,130
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

415
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,420
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

416
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,010
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

417
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:15,020
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

418
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,480
Take off your hat.

419
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,020
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

420
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,440
Yes, Mr Ness.

421
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,400
Kiss.

422
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,740
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

423
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,330
Now, go!

424
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,060
Malone!

425
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,610
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

426
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:07,190
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

427
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,610
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

428
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,780
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

429
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:17,490
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

430
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,160
A huge international
shipment's coming.

431
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,960
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

432
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:28,260
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

433
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,340
How do you come by this information?

434
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,680
That's the second rule
of police work:

435
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,640
if you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

436
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,190
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

437
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,980
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

438
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,440
If we can establish
any payments to him,

439
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,700
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

440
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,240
What?

441
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,790
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

442
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,330
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

443
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,590
Well, it's better than nothing.

444
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,800
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

445
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,930
I don't know.

446
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:18,050
Go to sleep, Oscar.

447
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:07,980
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey

448
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,860
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organisation.

449
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:15,650
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

450
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:21,740
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

451
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,160
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

452
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:29,290
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

453
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,630
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

454
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,630
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

455
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

456
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:43,720
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr Ness, is half the battle.

457
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,140
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

458
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:51,690
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

459
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,400
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

460
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,820
Thank you, Captain.

461
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,700
All right! Move out!

462
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,850
Take it easy.

463
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,430
Take it easy!
lt'll all happen in time.

464
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,150
This is the job.

465
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:34,020
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

466
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,860
Just watch what does happen.

467
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,110
Are you my 'tutor'?

468
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,160
Yes, sir, that I am.

469
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,830
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

470
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,130
Then leave it alone.

471
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,380
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

472
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:59,220
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

473
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,720
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

474
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:09,020
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

475
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,310
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

476
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,860
Stitches and standing in the rain...

477
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,270
Listen, Mr Ness...

478
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,770
I had an idea.

479
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,330
You all have your spare shells?

480
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,350
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

481
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,470
And put your man down.

482
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,690
Because he'll do the same to you.

483
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,110
Shoot to kill.

484
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,650
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

485
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,700
Let's go.

486
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,560
Easy...

487
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,390
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

488
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,190
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

489
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,110
George, the count's right.

490
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,610
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

491
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,530
Malone, you and I will
take the men...

492
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,620
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

493
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,330
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

494
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,620
Charge!

495
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,750
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'

496
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:30,010
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

497
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,180
Move, move!

498
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:44,020
Let's go!

499
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,700
I can't believe it!

500
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,950
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

501
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,950
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

502
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,680
Stone, take the first car!

503
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,850
Get this shit out of the way!

504
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,870
Tough guy!

505
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,840
Stone!

506
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,420
Go!

507
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,090
Stone!

508
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,510
I'm okay.

509
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,100
You thugs!

510
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,530
You all right?

511
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,620
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

512
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:33,340
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

513
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:37,260
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

514
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,470
Hello.

515
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,060
All right! Drop the gun!

516
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,770
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

517
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,900
I said, drop it!

518
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,320
Stop!

519
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,580
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

520
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,950
What are you, deaf?!

521
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,250
What is this, a game?!

522
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,280
Here. Sit down.

523
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,750
Stone's gonna be all right.

524
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,920
I got the fellow with the satchel.

525
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,920
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

526
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,970
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

527
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,970
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

528
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:31,770
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

529
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,230
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

530
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,110
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

531
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,990
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

532
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,580
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

533
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,790
Why don't you kiss my ass?

534
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,210
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

535
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,500
- You've broken the law...
- Eliot!

536
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,750
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

537
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,010
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

538
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,970
- Eliot!
- What?!

539
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,550
Look at this!

540
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,600
- Look at this!
- What is this?

541
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,640
What is this?

542
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,190
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

543
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,650
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'

544
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,660
And you got a heading here...
'Circuit Court'

545
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:30,540
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court' What is this?

546
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,710
Nothin' There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

547
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,250
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

548
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,250
then we can put Capone away.

549
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:43,180
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

550
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,140
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

551
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,810
Translate this ledger for us!

552
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,560
- In hell.
- In hell?!

553
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:55,520
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

554
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:59,360
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

555
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,320
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

556
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:08,160
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

557
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,290
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

558
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,290
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

559
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,580
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

560
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,550
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

561
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,090
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

562
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,300
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

563
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:30,680
I'm gonna count to three.

564
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,140
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

565
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,560
One.

566
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,700
Two!

567
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,160
Three.

568
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,700
I'm gonna talk!

569
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:56,500
Don't ! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

570
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:03,380
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

571
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:06,630
Now, ask him what you want to know.

572
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,010
All right... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

573
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:15,350
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete...

574
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,060
Mister Ness!

575
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,450
I do not approve of your methods!

576
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:32,330
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

577
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,790
- What?
- They got the shipment.

578
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,540
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

579
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:45,710
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate...

580
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,850
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

581
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:56,640
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

582
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,060
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

583
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:02,560
I want to piss on his ashes!

584
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:08,030
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

585
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,490
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

586
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,660
- Yes.
- Like what?

587
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,870
Like what his name is.

588
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:21,250
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

589
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,960
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

590
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:28,050
No...it'll be Edgar.

591
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:33,140
- It'll be J. Edgar...
- I don't think so.

592
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,100
God, you're beautiful.

593
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,190
You should have seen us last night.

594
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:48,400
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

595
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:51,860
I know. I understand, I do.

596
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,280
Just tell me, are you being careful?

597
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:00,000
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

598
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,370
- Progress?
- Yes?

599
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:06,750
Mrs Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

600
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:19,890
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone

601
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:25,020
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading

602
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:28,780
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

603
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,110
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

604
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,410
Mr Capone could have
up to 28 years.

605
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,790
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

606
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:50,630
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

607
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,970
- We'll call, let it ring...
- Twice.

608
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:55,090
- We'll call...
- From the corner.

609
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,890
- Anybody knocks on the door...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

610
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,100
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

611
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,100
Much more diverting
than accounting.

612
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,480
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

613
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:11,150
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

614
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:19,580
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

615
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,040
Okay, we see yous tonight.

616
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:26,000
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

617
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:37,760
...he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

618
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:43,680
For which I must commend
the excellent work

619
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:47,560
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

620
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,530
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

621
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:55,700
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

622
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,870
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

623
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,450
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

624
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,120
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

625
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:10,670
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

626
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,170
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

627
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,970
Mr Burns, where's Mr Wallace?

628
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:23,680
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

629
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,730
- You keep an eye out at all times...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

630
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,400
They are going to...

631
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:42,780
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

632
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,290
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

633
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,630
Oh, no.

634
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:38,800
- No, no!
- Easy... Easy!

635
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,840
Oscar.

636
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,090
Oh, Jesus.

637
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,600
You gonna be all right?

638
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:55,880
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

639
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,090
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

640
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,930
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

641
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:06,260
Jimmy!

642
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:10,140
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

643
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:12,390
You know what I mean?

644
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:31,410
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr Capone...

645
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:35,120
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr Capone...

646
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,210
I said...

647
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,140
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

648
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:50,100
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

649
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,310
Now he does.

650
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,860
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

651
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:01,400
That's it, come on!

652
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:05,200
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

653
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,410
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

654
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,490
- What?
- Easy.

655
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,250
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

656
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,210
Easy. It's me. It's me!

657
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,130
Not this way.

658
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:26,050
You fuck, you got nothin'
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

659
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:31,930
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'

660
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:36,520
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin' you punk!

661
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,990
Well, no, I understand.

662
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,080
Believe me, I understand.

663
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,880
Well, what's happened?

664
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:07,970
He says he can't be unprotected.

665
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,430
What is it that the guy says?

666
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,220
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

667
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:18,770
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

668
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:23,230
So tomorrow morning the D.A. will
announce that he's dropping the case.

669
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,320
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

670
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,240
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

671
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:34,080
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

672
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,200
Hello?

673
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,290
Hello.

674
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,920
Yes.

675
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:51,130
No, he didn't have a family.

676
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,310
How is everything there?

677
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,060
No, you do it however you want.

678
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,360
I promise I will.

679
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,780
You give her my love.

680
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:13,030
I love you, too.

681
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:20,330
Mr Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

682
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:24,500
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti...
- I think that's enough for today.

683
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:28,760
- If we don't stay on top...
- That'll do. Thank you.

684
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,880
I'd like to request to stick around.

685
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:36,640
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

686
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,610
Is that it?

687
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:51,320
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

688
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,990
My question is, are we done?

689
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,370
Yes, I think we're done.

690
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:01,460
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

691
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,040
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr Wallace.

692
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,540
He's dead! And the D.A.
is gonna drop the case!

693
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,050
He will not go into court
without a witness

694
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:12,220
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

695
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:17,260
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

696
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:20,220
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

697
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,330
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was...

698
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:42,200
- My wife?
- Yeah.

699
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:49,040
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

700
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,720
It's nice being married, eh?

701
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,300
Yes.

702
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:59,810
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

703
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:04,310
going over...
kitchen colour charts or something.

704
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:16,660
Some part of the world still cares
what colour the kitchen is.

705
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,500
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

706
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,460
Get back to the D.A. and stall him.

707
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:36,340
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

708
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,180
I think I know how to find this guy.

709
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:47,020
Walter?

710
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:52,230
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

711
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,360
We're leavin' tonight.

712
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,740
Two ball, down.

713
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,830
Mike, you got a minute?

714
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,710
I do now, don't I?

715
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:15,090
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

716
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:18,630
This is a place for cops.

717
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,430
Can we step outside?

718
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,970
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

719
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:35,730
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

720
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:40,820
What? What?!

721
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:44,120
I just need one more
piece of information.

722
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:46,290
One more? Jimmy!

723
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,540
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

724
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:58,630
Are you crazy? Y ou're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

725
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,840
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

726
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:07,640
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

727
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:10,100
And I tried to save your life.

728
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:15,570
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'

729
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,940
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

730
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:24,160
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

731
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:28,580
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

732
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:34,330
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

733
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:41,800
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

734
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:46,010
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

735
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:50,350
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

736
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,600
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

737
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:57,360
I'm gonna turn you over!

738
01:15:57,570 --> 01:16:01,110
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

739
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,120
You're dead.

740
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,390
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

741
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,430
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'

742
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:44,070
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

743
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,320
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

744
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:50,040
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

745
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,830
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool...

746
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,670
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

747
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,460
I have men out there
risking more than that.

748
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:02,170
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead

749
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:07,340
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

750
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:11,470
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

751
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,270
<i>He's at the D.A. 's.</i>

752
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,390
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

753
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,420
- Al! Al!
- Mr Capone!

754
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:42,050
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'

755
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:46,380
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

756
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:50,640
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole'

757
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:54,100
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

758
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:55,730
You understand?

759
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:01,060
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

760
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:04,030
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

761
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:10,700
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

762
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:13,540
To speak to me like men? No.

763
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:16,660
To harass a peaceful man.

764
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,130
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

765
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:23,710
I would have
just a little more self respect.

766
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:30,260
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

767
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:33,430
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

768
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:23,310
Isn't that just like a wop?

769
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:27,230
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

770
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:34,070
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

771
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,570
Go on, get your ass out of here!

772
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,550
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

773
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,390
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

774
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,020
Round the back.

775
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:38,780
Malone!

776
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,740
Malone.

777
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:14,270
Goddamn! Stone!

778
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,980
Stone!

779
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,610
The phone!

780
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:27,280
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

781
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:33,750
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

782
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,880
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

783
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,670
This? You want this?

784
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,760
You want this?

785
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:55,440
What?

786
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,610
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

787
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,910
- Book...
- The bookkeeper?

788
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:11,330
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

789
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,830
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

790
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,130
He's on this train.

791
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:21,710
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

792
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,180
No. Malone. No.

793
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:30,140
Stay. Stay.

794
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:32,770
Stay! Malone...

795
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:35,020
No. No, no!

796
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:40,320
Not this... Not this man...

797
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:10,600
Train's leavin' for Miami
12.05, Mr Ness.

798
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:14,350
We'll be there.

799
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,940
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

800
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,900
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.

801
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:35,580
Cover the south entrance.

802
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:26,800
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

803
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:35,260
<i>Your attention, please. The Miami</i>
<i>Flier departs at 12.05 from 33.</i>

804
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:37,520
<i>All aboard.</i>

805
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:51,950
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

806
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:56,490
Stay right there.
Stay right there, honey.

807
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:12,340
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>The Miami Flier, leaving at 12.05,</i>

808
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:16,470

<i>All aboard!</i>

809
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:33,110

I'm just gonna leave this right here.

810
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:27,960
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>The Miami Flier, leaving at 12.05,</i>

811
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:33,420
<i>is now boarding on track 33.</i>
<i>All aboard!</i>

812
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:36,010
One more. Here we go.

813
01:29:58,490 --> 01:30:00,330
Here we go. You ready?

814
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,330
I'm right here, honey. Here we go.

815
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:10,500
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

816
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:13,300
<i>This is the final call</i>
<i>for the Miami Flier,</i>

817
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:17,760
<i>leaving at 12.05 on track 33.</i>
<i>All aboard!</i>

818
01:30:57,090 --> 01:31:02,550
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

819
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,180
Are you all right? Thank you.

820
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:10,850
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

821
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:15,070
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

822
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:21,660
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

823
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:25,950
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

824
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:34,130
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

825
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:39,630
Thank you again,
this is so wonderful.

826
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:43,680
Thank you, sir.

827
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:55,980
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

828
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:59,280
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.

829
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:06,910
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

830
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:12,710
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

831
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,130
Is something wrong?

832
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:18,710
Sir?

833
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:17,210
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

834
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,550
- What are you doin'
- Shut up!

835
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:27,590
- What are you doin'
- Shut the fuck up!

836
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,140
- Hold it!
- Please...

837
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:33,970
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

838
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:38,480
I said hold it!

839
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:42,480
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

840
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:45,610
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

841
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:50,490
See? Or else he dies.

842
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,740
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'

843
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,380
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

844
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:06,130
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'

845
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:10,760
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

846
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:13,470
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

847
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,560
- One!
- Will you stop it!

848
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:29,110
Take him.

849
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:33,240
Two.

850
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:02,100
The two coded entries
in this ledger

851
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:06,940
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

852
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:12,820
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

853
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:17,620
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

854
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,500
I said that is correct.

855
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:26,550
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

856
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:30,840
I will.

857
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:33,390
Sorry, Mr Payne, I can't hear you.

858
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:36,390
I said, I will.

859
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,310
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr Capone?

860
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,850
Yes, I was.

861
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,110
And you personally
distributed monies...

862
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:50,360
..vast, undeclared monies...

863
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:53,910
..to Mr Capone?

864
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:56,490
Yes, I did.

865
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:59,540
Would you tell us the amounts?

866
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:07,090
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr Capone

867
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:12,220
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

868
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:17,890
Would you repeat that amount, please?

869
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:24,730
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

870
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,370
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

871
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:47,750
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

872
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:14,110
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

873
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:19,740
Get me the bailiff.

874
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:22,740
It'll be a fast trial.

875
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:30,960
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

876
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:36,090
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

877
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:46,020
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

878
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:19,180
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

879
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:23,970
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

880
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:27,810
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

881
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:35,730
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

882
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,570
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

883
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:43,030
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

884
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:47,120
"Mr Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

885
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:49,750
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

886
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:53,420
I'm sorry, Mr Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

887
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:57,590
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

888
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,970
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

889
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:36,420
1634 Racine... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

890
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,190
Don't . Let him go.

891
01:40:56,820 --> 01:41:00,030
- No!
- Here, take it.

892
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:15,700
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

893
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,410
What are you waitin' for?

894
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:23,500
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

895
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,960
Don't push me.

896
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:35,340
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

897
01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:38,680
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

898
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:41,060
'Cause you killed my friend!

899
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:44,900
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

900
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,730
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

901
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:52,440
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

902
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,630
Did he sound anything like that?

903
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:41,950
One picture, come on, one picture.

904
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:47,250
Mr Ness, take a look at this.

905
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:50,590
Mr Ness?

906
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:56,680
Mr Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

907
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,640
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr Ness.

908
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:02,640
They've been bribed.

909
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:06,940
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

910
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,610
He's in the car.

911
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:33,500
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow...

912
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:39,430
Your Honour, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

913
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:44,510
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

914
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:48,810
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

915
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:53,650
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must...

916
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:57,280
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr Ness.

917
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:09,870
Would you excuse us?

918
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:13,900
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

919
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:21,360
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

920
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:24,700
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

921
01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:30,160
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

922
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:35,630
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

923
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:38,250
What's he talking about?

924
01:49:40,130 --> 01:49:44,590
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

925
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,140
Your Honour, I object!

926
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:49,310
Overruled.

927
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:55,100
What did you tell him?

928
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:00,150
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

929
01:50:01,490 --> 01:50:04,280
His name wasn't in the ledger!

930
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:07,530
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

931
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:09,240
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

932
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:12,790
- I think...
- Do somethin' here.

933
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,580
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'

934
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:18,170
Order!

935
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:23,510
Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

936
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,680
and enter a plea of Guilty.

937
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:32,060
- Guiltý?
- Order in the court!

938
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:34,310
Order!

939
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:46,110
Bailiff! Bailiff!

940
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,780
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

941
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,620
Eliot!

942
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:55,000
Your Honour!
Is that justice?

943
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:57,920
Please, why did he switch the jury?

944
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,670
Are you gonna go
after the organisation?

945
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,340
Excuse me.

946
01:51:03,630 --> 01:51:06,930
I'm askin' Your Honour,
is this justice?

947
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,020
Is this justice?

948
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:20,060
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

949
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:21,770
What did you say?

950
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:25,110
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

951
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:27,360
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

952
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:30,120
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

953
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:33,120
Here endeth the lesson.

954
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:37,580
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

955
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:41,000
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

956
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:01,290
So much violence.

957
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,900
Cleaning up a little.

958
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:21,580
I guess this is goodbye.

959
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:24,500
Goodbye, George.

960
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:30,210
I want to...thank you for this.

961
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:33,090
No. Thank you.

962
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:53,610
Mr Ness... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

963
01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:56,910
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

964
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:03,120
I'm going home.

965
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:16,680
Mr Ness!
Any comment for the record?

966
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,590
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

967
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,350
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

968
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,560
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

969
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:28,850
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.
