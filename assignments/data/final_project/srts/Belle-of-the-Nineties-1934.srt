- Molly?

She doesn't mean a thing.
Just a passing fancy.

Maybe you think I'm a passing fancy.

Am I to understand
that you're rejecting my proposal?

365

Oh, no. I just want little time
to figure this out.

366

You see, I'm in the habit
of picking my own men.

- You, too?

I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

You don't mean to tell me
you actually missed me.

More than that.
I can't get you out of my mind, Ruby.

Did you ever give me a second thought?

There's lots of things I would like

What's wrong, Ruby? You have changed.
I can't figure you out.

Wasn't you just a little bit nervous
when he gave you all those presents?

No, I was calm and collected.

There was no reason for him giving me
all those wonderful presents.

in the first place.
