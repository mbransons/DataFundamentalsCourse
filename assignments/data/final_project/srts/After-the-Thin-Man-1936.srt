1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,039
Nickie!

3
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,103
What are you doing?

4
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:16,719
Just practicing, dear.
Will you have a little slice of throat?

5
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:20,714
You'd better hurry, we're getting
into San Francisco in five minutes.

6
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,772
Asta, my best Sunday-go-to-meeting hat!

7
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,787
Darling, don't you want to pack these?

8
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:35,025
How they can expect a woman
to still have any mystery left for a man...

9
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,026
after living in a place like this
for three days, I don't know.

10
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:41,148
You don't need mystery. You've got
something better and more alluring.

11
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,304
- What?
- Me.

12
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:43,404
You!

13
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,027
It's all right, we're married.
Darling, you've got to pack.

14
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:54,078
Yes, that's right. Pack. I must pack.

15
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,113
Are you packing, dear?

16
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,232
Yes, darling,
I'm just putting away this liquor.

17
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,114
If you break that, they can sue you.

18
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,785
Oh, baby, you know,
I'm going to miss this little room of ours.

19
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:20,078
- It's left some lasting impressions on me.
- Dear, will you pack this?

20
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,716
Yes, delighted.

21
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,796
- You know, I sort of hate to leave this.
- Don't leave anything.

22
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,798
Well, are you gonna wear this dress, dear?

23
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,232
- No, you can put that in.
- That's fine.

24
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,390
- Hey, is Nick Charles in this car?
- Two cars back.

25
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,959
Hello, Nick.

26
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,149
How long till you're detecting again?
That's what we want to know.

27
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:04,587
I'm through detecting for
the rest of my natural life.

28
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,468
Will you keep on
with your detective work?

29
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:07,624
I've retired.

30
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:10,908
I'll take care of my wife's money
so I'll have something in my old age.

31
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,507
You said you'd retired,
but you took that Thin Man case.

32
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:16,107
That was a beaut.
They're still talking about it.

33
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:17,227
Smile for the news, Nick.

34
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:19,029
Dig us up another Thin Man,
will you, Nick?

35
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,147
That was a great case.

36
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:22,225
You'd take a case like that,
wouldn't you, Nick?

37
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:24,827
I only took that to please my wife,
she wanted excitement.

38
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,064
I guess she had it.

39
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:28,305
It was wonderful!
Two men tried to kill him.

40
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:31,109
But he's not going to take any more cases.
You can print that.

41
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,599
That's my darling.

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,667
Can you get a big story
like that for us Nick?

43
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,909
How could I?

44
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,066
Welcome home, Mrs. Charles.

45
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,826
- Hello, Harold.
- Hiya, Nick.

46
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:45,354
Hiya, Harold. I'm glad to see you.

47
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,358
So long, Nick. See you around.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,355
- Excuse me, lady.
- Hello, Fingers.

49
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,280
- Well, Nick, how are you?
- How's business?

50
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,986
I quit that racket.

51
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:05,667
- Nick, look, my purse is gone.
- Darling, isn't that too bad.

52
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,947
- Nora, I want you to know Fingers.
- How do you do?

53
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:10,190
- This is my wife.
- Your wife?

54
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,597
- I didn't know you were married.
- Yes, I'm married.

55
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,787
Nick, what'll I do? I know I had it.

56
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:30,307
Don't worry, darling.
It'll turn up, won't it, Fingers?

57
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,747
- Well, I certainly hope so.
- Yeah.

58
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:35,149
Nick, am I tickled to death to see you.

59
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,026
Good old Nick, and married, too.

60
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,148
- I didn't know you were married.
- Oh, yes.

61
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:41,117
I'm glad I bumped into you.

62
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,945
- Goodbye, Mrs. Charles.
- Goodbye.

63
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,264
Goodbye, Fingers.

64
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,547
- Come on, dear.
- But, darling, I can't just go off...

65
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,907
We don't want to embarrass him.

66
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:51,145
- What're you talking about?
- He's a purse snatcher.

67
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,507
- Think of his feelings.
- Then he must have taken it.

68
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:54,989
- So long, Fingers.
- So long, Nick.

69
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,559
Here you are, dear.

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,230
Dear, you do know the nicest people.

71
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,356
- Hello, Nick.
- Hello, Bill!

72
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,795
You can start delivering again.
No, the big kegs.

73
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,877
- Hello, Nick. Where you been?
- Hello. How are you, boys?

74
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,478
- Where have you been?
- Have I been away all my life.

75
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,785
- Have you seen The Kid?
- No, where is he?

76
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:29,828
- He's staging a comeback Friday night.
- Yeah?

77
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,990
Hey, Screwy. Here's Nick Charles.

78
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,787
- Hello, Mr. Charles.
- How are you? Glad to see you.

79
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,386
- Hello, Nick.
- Hi, Kid. How's it going?

80
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,987
Never better! Say, now I know I can't lose.

81
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:40,347
You coming to see me fight?

82
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,904
Mrs. Charles would never think
of missing your fight.

83
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:45,384
Mrs. Charles? Did you ever see me fight?

84
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:48,067
You got a treat, then.
I'm gonna cut that guy up in ribbons.

85
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,625
- If he's not bleeding in the first round...
- You'll have him bleeding? Yeah!

86
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:53,066
Excuse me, Mrs. Charles.

87
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,949
If my legs will only hold out,
I'll kill the guy, I'll knock...

88
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,669
Attaboy, Bump. You'll get him, sure.
Give it to him hot, eh?

89
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,591
- Sure.
- Okay, Harold.

90
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,111
- Hello, Nora!
- Hello.

91
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,267
Who is that?

92
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:12,591
You wouldn't know them, darling.
They're respectable.

93
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,668
Isn't it lovely? Home.

94
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,185
So peaceful, so quiet.

95
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:38,432
If anybody wakes me up for a week,
I'm going to have the law on them!

96
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,512
New Year's Eve at home. Or would
you know that this is New Year's?

97
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,355
- I know.
- I suppose you got ideas, huh?

98
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,389
- Very definite ideas.
- I was afraid so.

99
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:23,508
I'm going to lock the door, plug the bell,
cut the telephone...

100
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,745
and crawl into bed for a month.

101
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:28,224
Nora, you're my favorite woman!

102
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:32,199
Here. I'm going to be in bed at midnight,
so Happy New Year.

103
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,439
Happy New Year!

104
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,429
Here. Come in. Give me your hat and coat.

105
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,272
Make yourself at home.

106
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,717
It's our house, all right.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,560
Let's go in. That man said it was all right.

108
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,824
- The bar is right in here. Help yourself.
- Thanks.

109
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:07,309
- Okay!
- What's the celebration?

110
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,744
We're giving a surprise party
for Nick and Nora.

111
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:12,629
- Nick and Nora?
- Don't you know Nick and Nora?

112
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,546
- No.
- Neither do I.

113
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:19,546
But that's not going to spoil my fun.
It's New Year's, so what's the odds?

114
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:23,076
- Go on in. Fake it. It's a cinch.
- Thanks.

115
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,233
Go on in and get some of that
Napoleon Brandy before it's all gone.

116
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,948
Let's get it together,
this is supposed to be a surprise party.

117
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:45,828
- Well, I'm acting surprised.
- Look at that. Not bad, eh?

118
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,510
- Oh, no, not at all.
- How're you doing?

119
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,266
- Anyone wise to you yet?
- No.

120
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:53,158
- What did I tell you?
- May I have this dance?

121
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,907
If I was in a fire on the third floor,
would you save me?

122
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,066
- It's too late for you to be saved.
- I mean it. How would you do it?

123
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,949
I'd just pick you up
and carry you right down like this.

124
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,227
Now you save me.

125
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:08,386
You put her down and you save me.
I'm on the third floor, too.

126
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:11,870
I'll bet you can't do this.
Now watch me. Here I go.

127
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,115
Not bad.

128
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,227
So when I picked this big lug up,
he didn't know a thing.

129
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,507
I taught him everything he knows.

130
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:23,468
Show them that new
arm lock I taught you.

131
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:24,568
Okay.

132
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,425
Just show him that headlock.
This will kill you.

133
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,717
Say, look, show him how
you throw them out in the aisle.

134
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,475
Hello, Nick. Hello, Nora. Welcome home.

135
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,073
We are tendering this
little surprise party for the...

136
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,708
Will you keep out of the kitchen?
We are busy.

137
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,625
Where'll I put this ice?

138
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,865
- Lay it down and don't bother me.
- Put it in the sink and break it up.

139
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,669
- Where's the oil?
- There isn't any more.

140
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,027
- Where do you want these?
- Over here, son.

141
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:18,106
And after that, come back
from the store with some olive oil.

142
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:20,919
- My toast!
- I'll take care of that.

143
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,987
Mr. Charles, what are you doing here?

144
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,433
All right!

145
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,598
Hello there, Mr. Charles.
I'm glad to see you back.

146
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,426
- How are you, Nick?
- Did you enjoy your trip to Los Angeles?

147
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:36,505
We saw your pictures in the paper.

148
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,186
It said you did a good job in New York.

149
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:41,186
I guess they'll be scared to death
if there are more murders there.

150
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:44,026
I've been scared
to go down in the cellar ever since.

151
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,866
Don't you worry, Rose,
if anyone murders you, I'll catch them.

152
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,988
Mr. Charles, don't be talking that way.

153
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:51,225
What do you think of the party
they're giving you?

154
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:52,746
Looks like we're giving it.

155
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,948
- It does that, now.
- Something's burning!

156
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:56,466
Excuse me, I'll answer the phone.

157
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,189
That's probably your Aunt Katherine.

158
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,909
She's phoned several times.
She wants you to come to dinner.

159
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,985
Goodbye, Mrs. Charles,
I'll see you next year.

160
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:04,948
- She expects you, too, Mr. Charles.
- Me?

161
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:07,025
There must be some mistake.
She wouldn't want you.

162
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,125
No.

163
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,304
What excuse will I make?

164
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:12,907
Tell her I lost a collar button in New York
and we've got to go look for it.

165
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:14,985
It's your cousin, Mrs. Landis, madam.

166
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,789
Thank heavens it isn't Aunt Katherine.

167
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,189
- Go on, get out of it now.
- Don't worry.

168
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,909
I wouldn't go through that again
if you had twice as much money.

169
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,035
Hello, Selma.

170
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,951
Nora, I just wanted to make sure
you were coming tonight.

171
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,669
But you've just got to come,
I'm in terrible trouble, please.

172
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,188
No, I can't tell you now,
but you must come. I'm desperate...

173
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:37,315
Selma!

174
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,626
- Whom are you calling?
- Nora.

175
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,785
- I told you...
- I can't help it. L...

176
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:43,429
There are pills in my bag, take them.

177
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:47,149
- No, really, I'm all right.
- Take them or I'll call Dr. Kammer.

178
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,392
How are you, Nora?

179
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,790
This is Aunt Katherine.

180
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,311
You ought to know Selma well enough
not to pay any attention to that.

181
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,599
You see, it's New Year's Eve,
Aunt Katherine.

182
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,950
- The old battle-axe.
- Shut up!

183
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,312
Excuse me, Aunt Katherine,
I was talking to the dog.

184
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,705
- But, Aunt Katherine...
- Give me that phone.

185
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:12,153
Give it to me.

186
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,595
Yes. All right. We'll come.

187
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,507
Nickie, I'm sorry. But I had to do it.

188
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:28,266
Selma's in trouble.
You like Selma, don't you?

189
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,590
Well, not that much.

190
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,072
Family dinner, I suppose?

191
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,111
Aunt Katherine, Uncle Willie...

192
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,867
Cousin Emily.

193
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:42,236
Aunt Hattie, Cousin Lucius, Uncle Thomas.

194
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,993
Pour me one, too.

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,319
Thanks.

196
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,668
Well, Asta?

197
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,228
Why are you looking so
down in the mouth?

198
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:08,436
Have you got family troubles, too?

199
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,307
For heaven's sake,
do you want the servants to hear you?

200
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,428
I don't care. I'm going crazy.
I can't stand it any longer.

201
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,707
- I'll call the police.
- You'll do nothing of the sort.

202
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,705
We've paid enough
to hush up his other scandals.

203
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:30,386
He never did anything like this before.

204
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:32,907
- How do we know whether he...
- I told you I'd handle this.

205
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,036
- I can't go on!
- Quiet!

206
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,479
Beg pardon, madam,
but should I remove Mr. Robert's plate?

207
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,996
- Certainly not. Mr. Robert will be here.
- Very well.

208
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,227
- You know he won't be here.
- I know nothing of the sort.

209
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:52,508
Now go upstairs and
make yourself presentable. Go on, hurry.

210
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:54,909
Hurry now, because everybody's waiting.

211
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,438
- Good evening, all.
- Good evening, Aunt Katherine.

212
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,754
I had a birthday last week, Katherine.
I'm 83 years old.

213
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,985
- What do you think of that?
- That's fine, Lucy.

214
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:10,594
- Next year I'll be 84.
- Splendid.

215
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,713
Now we're alone. I have something
important to tell all of you.

216
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,749
What did she say?

217
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:19,549
Isn't that thing working, Hattie?

218
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,190
This works beautifully.
It's you, you mumble.

219
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,786
What is it, Katherine?

220
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:26,474
Nora and her husband are coming tonight.

221
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,986
- Katherine, after the last time?
- But, Katherine...

222
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:31,789
- Her husband?
- That person.

223
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,147
But you said yourself
you wouldn't have him again.

224
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:35,586
I know I did.

225
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:38,905
And my opinion of him and what
he represents hasn't changed a particle.

226
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:40,187
Then why did you ask him?

227
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:44,068
I have a very good reason for asking him,
which you will know in time.

228
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,224
That must be they now. Understand, now,
I want you all to be pleasant to him.

229
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,667
- Of course, if you say so.
- It's going to be difficult.

230
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,788
Poor Nora, my heart bleeds for that child.

231
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,227
If that's Mr. And Mrs. Charles,
show them right in.

232
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:56,594
Yes, madam.

233
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,428
What are you muttering to yourself?

234
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:03,751
I'm trying to get all the bad words
out of my system.

235
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,599
Good evening, Henry.

236
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,318
Is this the wax-works?

237
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,114
- Sir?
- Nothing, Henry, nothing.

238
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,428
I'll leave my things down here.

239
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,830
Don't worry, it isn't catching.

240
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,358
Thank you, sir. Walk this way, sir.

241
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,431
Well, I'll try.

242
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,826
Nickie, pull yourself together.

243
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:38,832
One squint at Aunt Katherine
would sober anybody up.

244
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,314
Mr. And Mrs. Charles, madam.

245
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,759
Hello. How do you do, my dear.

246
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,953
Hello, Aunt Katherine.
You remember Nick?

247
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,591
How are you, Nicholas?

248
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,945
- Hello, Cousin Helen.
- How are you, you poor child?

249
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:01,157
This is Nora's husband.
I think you know everybody.

250
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,438
Yes, I seem to remember the old faces.

251
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,870
Dear, I want you to meet Uncle Willie.

252
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,190
Poor Nora is so brave.

253
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,473
- Uncle Willie, my husband.
- Uncle.

254
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,196
And, dear, this is Aunt Hattie.

255
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,717
- How are you?
- Don't mumble, young man.

256
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,104
How are you?

257
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,829
- She's deaf.
- You're telling me.

258
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,399
What did she say?

259
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,039
When you hear the chime
it will be exactly...

260
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,307
- Selma, how are you?
- It's so good to see you.

261
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,704
Hello, Nick. Thank heavens you came.

262
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:40,546
Selma, what's the trouble? Tell me.

263
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:43,677
We'll postpone any
discussion until after dinner.

264
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,385
- Where's your husband?
- Yes, where's Robert?

265
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:49,631
Robert telephoned
that he was unavoidably detained.

266
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,559
So we'll start without him. Are you ready?

267
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,831
We haven't quite men enough around, so,
Lucius, will you take Hattie and Charlotte?

268
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,551
Willie, will you take Helen and Emily?
Burton, will you take Nora?

269
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,555
Nicholas, you will take Aunt Lucy.

270
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,433
Come on, Selma.

271
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,225
What was it you were going to tell me?

272
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:33,833
Nora, come here!

273
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,424
Just a minute, Aunt Katherine.
What was it?

274
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:39,159
- Robert has disappeared.
- Disappeared?

275
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,918
Selma, go on playing.

276
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,757
I can't go on playing.

277
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,433
Nonsense, go on!

278
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,793
I can't! What are you trying to do,
torture me?

279
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,908
How can you act like this when you know
what she's going through?

280
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:08,468
- Get Nicholas.
- You bet I will.

281
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,350
No, really?

282
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,871
Well, you amaze me.

283
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,188
Will you explain that point a bit further?

284
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
Well, I wouldn't go as far as to say that.

285
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,355
What's that?

286
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,757
Just a moment.

287
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,435
Really?

288
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,507
Well, now, surely you're not going
to let that pass unchallenged, are you?

289
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,909
You must have something to say to that.

290
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,831
That's the boy. I knew you had it in you.

291
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,633
Nick, come here.

292
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,309
- Oh, yes.
- Hurry!

293
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,636
If you gentlemen will excuse me.

294
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,152
I don't know when I've spent
such a stimulating evening.

295
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,433
What is it?

296
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,629
- Aunt Katherine wants to speak to you.
- What have I done now?

297
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,748
Do you know why
Robert wasn't here tonight?

298
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:16,948
- Sure, because he's smart.
- I'm not fooling, darling, he's disappeared.

299
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:20,828
That's swell. Now if we could just
get Aunt Katherine to disappear...

300
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,227
Here he is.

301
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:26,710
Nicholas, I'm sorry
to take you away from the boys.

302
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,831
That's quite all right.

303
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,040
- How long has Robert been gone?
- Three days.

304
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,111
Three days without a word.

305
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,627
- Have you notified the police?
- Certainly not.

306
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,625
- And we're not going to.
- Oh, no.

307
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,509
Robert may have been kidnapped.
He may be lying dead somewhere.

308
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:43,069
But we mustn't do anything about it.

309
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,065
Our precious name
might get into the papers.

310
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:48,465
Don't pay any attention to her.
She's exaggerating the whole affair.

311
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:52,466
However, to please her, I thought you
might investigate the matter quietly.

312
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:55,597
- With your experience as a...
- Flatfoot.

313
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,906
I didn't mean to be blunt as that.

314
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:00,905
What's the difference? It's all in the family.

315
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:02,985
- Have you any idea where he might be?
- Yes.

316
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:06,385
- He's with some woman, I know that.
- Selma, you know nothing of the sort!

317
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:09,588
What about the vanity case they sent me
from that Chinese restaurant?

318
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:11,867
That was a stupid mistake on their part.

319
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:14,428
Mistake? He's with some woman,
you know it.

320
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,227
Selma, you know Robert
worships you. He wouldn't...

321
00:22:17,327 --> 00:22:20,109
How can you say such a thing
when you know that he hates me?

322
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,397
He only married me for my money!
He never did love me.

323
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,796
Sometimes I wish he were dead!

324
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,949
I'm just a little confused.
Do you want him back or don't you?

325
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,998
- Nick!
- Why, of course she wants him back.

326
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,438
- Selma, don't, please don't.
- I'll leave this in your hands, Nicholas.

327
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,678
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go back to my guests.

328
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,225
Don't worry, darling.
It'll be all right. Nick will find him.

329
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:47,109
The one sure way
to get him back is to cut off his money.

330
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:49,866
- I know.
- Well, if he doesn't show up before...

331
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:52,829
tomorrow morning, I'll go down
to the police and see what I can do.

332
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:54,512
- Thank you, Nick.
- Mr. Graham calling, madam.

333
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,908
- David, Happy New Year!
- David, how are you!

334
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:01,666
Nora, nice to see you.
Thank heaven you two are back.

335
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:04,224
Selma, how are you, dear? Any word yet?

336
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:06,595
- I'll tell you what.
- What?

337
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,347
Let's take David and sneak out. We'll go
somewhere and celebrate the New Year.

338
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,787
Hey, that's a good idea!
How about it, Selma?

339
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:15,706
Come on, it'll be like old times,
when we were all engaged.

340
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:18,268
Yes, before we made any mistakes.

341
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,225
What do you mean, "mistakes"?

342
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:24,518
- I was thinking of Selma.
- Come on, Selma.

343
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,826
Thanks, I want to stay near the telephone,
you know, just in case... You go, David.

344
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:32,384
No, not on your life. I'll stay here with you.

345
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:34,625
Well, then good night, dear.

346
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:36,748
- Try to have a Happy New Year.
- Yes.

347
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,948
- Happy New Year.
- Very Happy New Year, Selma.

348
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,546
- Good night, David.
- Good night.

349
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:44,105
- Come, we'll say good-bye to the family.
- It will be a pleasure.

350
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:45,872
Look what I found.

351
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,469
- Iced and everything.
- Don't you stay here, David.

352
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:53,599
- You go out and have some fun.
- Don't be silly, we can have fun right here.

353
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,107
What's the matter with me, anyway?
Why haven't I any pride?

354
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:01,228
Why can't I face it?
Robert doesn't give a hang about me.

355
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:05,154
Can you indefinitely go on caring
for someone who doesn't care for you?

356
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,918
Well, it's been done.

357
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,032
David, I'm so sorry. I've been such a fool.

358
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,347
You really ought to hate me
for what I've done to you.

359
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:19,746
Don't talk like that. Look, you get
the glasses and I'll try to open this thing...

360
00:24:19,846 --> 00:24:23,674
No, we're going out. This is a new year,
the time for resolutions.

361
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,748
I'm through with Robert, I mean it.
I'm going to get my things.

362
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:29,186
We're going to celebrate!

363
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:31,510
We'll start the New Year right.

364
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,157
- What is it, Henry? The telephone? Has it...
- No, madam, it's Mrs. Forrest.

365
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,309
She would like you to join her
in the drawing room.

366
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,832
All right, Henry.

367
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,988
I guess it's no use.

368
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:54,275
- Please go, David.
- Now, Selma.

369
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,476
No, I'd rather you did, really. I'll go to bed.

370
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,077
Dr. Kammer's given me
something to make me sleep.

371
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,199
All right, I'll go.

372
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,949
- Good night, Henry.
- Good night.

373
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,624
Darling, you will try
to find Robert, won't you?

374
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:12,748
- I didn't lose him.
- It'll get you in right with Aunt Katherine.

375
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,107
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Oh, Nick...

376
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:19,186
- David. What happened?
- Selma sent me away, wanted to be alone.

377
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,946
I could murder that Robert.

378
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:23,706
Wait till I tell you about
the newest thing he pulled on me.

379
00:25:23,806 --> 00:25:25,146
He called me several days ago...

380
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:27,065
and told me if I gave him $25,000...

381
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:29,065
he'd clear out and leave Selma for me.

382
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:31,071
- Lovely boy.
- What did you say?

383
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,425
Well, I didn't know exactly what to say.

384
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:36,186
I asked him to give me several days
to think it over.

385
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,909
$25,000 is cheap if he'll really go.

386
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:40,389
Why don't you get up a collection?

387
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:43,508
I know a lot of people
who would be glad to contribute.

388
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,985
Poor girl, it was bad enough
with Aunt Katherine and Robert...

389
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,878
- now she's got that Dr. Kammer.
- Who's Dr. Kammer?

390
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,754
I don't know, he's some nut psychologist.

391
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,307
Sits around and talks about
her dreams by the hour.

392
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:57,747
I get the creeps every time I look at him.

393
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,145
Harold, we want to go someplace
and get the taste of respectability...

394
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:03,145
- out of our mouths.
- Okay, Nick.

395
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:06,312
- I don't think I can go.
- David, why not?

396
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,184
I've got too much on my mind, I guess.
I'm glad you're back, anyway.

397
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:13,946
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, David.

398
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:16,349
Selma was a fool
not to have married him instead of Robert.

399
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,506
Well, they all can't be
as lucky as you are, darling.

400
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:21,266
What have you got to offer, Harold?

401
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:23,388
There's Tim McCrum's,
and there's the Lichee...

402
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:25,029
and there's the Tin Dipper.

403
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:27,467
- Is the Lichee a Chinese restaurant?
- Yes'm.

404
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:30,154
- Me no lookee for Robert.
- The Lichee.

405
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,873
The Lichee.

406
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,347
Not now, baby, I gotta make a change.
I'll be right back.

407
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:50,876
- Well, make it snappy.
- Waiter, bring Mr. Landis another drink.

408
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,944
Hello, Dancer.

409
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:02,424
Say, what's the idea?
You better not leave that guy.

410
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:05,985
- These shoes are murdering me.
- Don't be long. He might get restless.

411
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:07,826
Say, I'm getting pretty fed up with him.

412
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:09,905
You can turn him loose tomorrow.

413
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:12,746
Yeah? Tomorrow's a holiday,
the banks will be closed.

414
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:14,708
Yeah, that's right.

415
00:29:14,808 --> 00:29:18,031
Well, the day after, what's the difference?
Is it worth it?

416
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,317
Come on, make it snappy.
I'll keep an eye on him.

417
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,708
- Polly! Polly!
- Sorry, Sonny, I'm busy.

418
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:27,668
- I got a message for you.
- Well, what is it?

419
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,797
- Your brother's looking for you.
- Well, let him look.

420
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,748
- So that's the way it is, huh?
- Phil, don't try to start anything...

421
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:40,347
- I'm in a hurry.
- You've been in a hurry since I got back.

422
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,829
Can I help it if I gotta work?

423
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:44,986
That ain't what I'm kickin' about.
What's going on with this drunk?

424
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:46,187
- Nothing.
- What's this?

425
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:49,229
Give me that. What are you trying to do,
drive me nuts?

426
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,153
Shut up, or I'll smack you
right in the teeth.

427
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,229
- I'm in on that, you know.
- Now, Phil, after all...

428
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,949
- If you don't cut me in, the party's off.
- I can't cut you in.

429
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,706
- It's yours, ain't it?
- Yeah, but...

430
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:02,104
- But what?
- Now listen, Phil, don't spoil my makeup...

431
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:05,954
- I got another number to do.
- So that's the way it is, eh?

432
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,831
You big lug.

433
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,026
- Now, how am I gonna explain that?
- There are a lot of things...

434
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,265
you'll have to explain
before I'm through with you.

435
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:15,365
Phil!

436
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,145
What are you doing?
Shaking her down again?

437
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,827
- What's that to you?
- Why don't you lay off her for a while?

438
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:37,309
- She's busy.
- I know.

439
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:40,790
- What do you know?
- A few things that are going on here.

440
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,190
Smart boy, eh? You know things.

441
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,785
When are you going
to start shaking me down?

442
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:49,075
When I want to shake you down...

443
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,269
I put up with you because
you're Polly's brother, but don't...

444
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,828
think you can ride too far on that ticket.

445
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,315
Now stay away for a couple of days.

446
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,830
My, what big confetti they throw here.

447
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,229
Get out of the way, you big clown.

448
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,988
- Well, that's more like it.
- Too bad we didn't bring Aunt Katherine.

449
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:12,630
- Oh, Mr. Charles. How are you?
- Hello, Dancer.

450
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,748
Neat way you have
of tossing your customers out.

451
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:17,187
His sister works here.
I just get tired of him sometimes.

452
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,388
- I felt a gun under his left arm.
- Just breaking it in for a friend.

453
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:23,067
I want you to meet my partner.
This is Lum Kee, Mr. Charles.

454
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:24,789
- And Mrs. Charles.
- How do you do?

455
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:27,866
- I'm your friend, you bet you.
- You sent his brother up, remember?

456
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:29,349
- Lum Yung?
- Oh, yes.

457
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:33,592
He's the one who spread out some tong
differences to include a bank stick-up.

458
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,631
You bet you. You catch my brother.
You play trick on him.

459
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,025
No play trick on him, no catch him.
You bet you. Is he still in?

460
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,998
You bet you. For five years more.

461
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,112
Excuse, please.

462
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,033
Is he a gunman, too?

463
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,232
No, but you never can tell
how close brothers are.

464
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,787
- Thought you might like to know.
- Thanks.

465
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:57,030
He's a great guy to have liking you.

466
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,318
This way, Mrs. Charles.

467
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,029
- Many customers tonight?
- Oh, yes.

468
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,953
We always do a pretty good business,
you know.

469
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,794
Follow me.

470
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,665
- Oh, Nickie, there's Robert!
- Yes, I know.

471
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:18,398
Why didn't you tell me?

472
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,312
- Why, Robert! Where have you been?
- Well, fancy meeting you here.

473
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,224
Why haven't you sent any word to Selma?
She's almost crazy with worry.

474
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,385
She ought to know better by now.

475
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,869
- Nicholas!
- How's it coming?

476
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,268
Fine, up till now.
Sorry I can't ask you to sit down.

477
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,433
That's all right. I'll ask her.
Nora, won't you sit down?

478
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,158
So, she sent the great
big detective to find me.

479
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,664
I have a table for you across the room,
Mr. Charles.

480
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:50,426
I think you'll be more comfortable there.

481
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:51,946
I'm sure they would.

482
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:53,626
I'll be over in just a minute. Thanks.

483
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:56,509
Why don't you call Selma
and tell her you're all right?

484
00:32:56,609 --> 00:33:00,354
- Well, don't exaggerate, just call her.
- You can tell her...

485
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,438
when you go back to report on me.
Tell her I'm having a swell time.

486
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,594
I'm not going back unless I have to.

487
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,830
And I don't think I'll have to.

488
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,439
I'll be delighted to tell her that.
Well, you'll forgive us...

489
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,036
if we tear ourselves away?
Dancer seems a bit anxious.

490
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,631
Hello, Handsome.

491
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,106
Is he a friend of yours?

492
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:38,236
On the contrary, a relation.

493
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,546
He's been hanging around here
for three days, drunk.

494
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,226
Got a case on our prima donna.

495
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:45,870
I wish you'd toss him out.
His wife's going crazy.

496
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,350
That's too bad. I'll speak to his girlfriend.

497
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,471
- Well, I've done my duty.
- I wonder what's up?

498
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,358
- Up where?
- Up there.

499
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,791
- Where?
- There, and it comes out here.

500
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,989
Scotch. Probably.

501
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,504
- His relatives just blew in.
- What'll we do?

502
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:25,346
Give the customers one more song
and knock off for the night.

503
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:27,069
Take him to your place
and keep him there.

504
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:28,169
Okay.

505
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,995
- Nickie, what time is it?
- It's 11:35.

506
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,677
- And our first New Year's alone.
- Hello, Nick.

507
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,193
Maybe I was wrong.

508
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,026
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello.

509
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:43,186
Excuse me, lady. Say, Nick,
Willie the Weeper's outside, see?

510
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:46,149
- When did he get out?
- He got out this morning. He's on parole.

511
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,986
According to rules and regulations
he ought to be mingling...

512
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,905
with some respectable people, see?

513
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,304
I thought you had
a nice table here, see? Maybe...

514
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:56,949
- By all means.
- That's fine, you're a gent!

515
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,234
Hey, boys!

516
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,427
- Everything all right, Mrs. Charles?
- Everything's all something.

517
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:10,187
You needn't worry about Mr. Landis.
Polly's going to see he gets home all right.

518
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,026
- Thank you.
- Waiter, no check for this table.

519
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:14,228
- Anything they want is on the house.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:17,748
- I can't let you do that, see?
- But I insist. You're my guest.

521
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:20,549
Come on, boys.
This'll mean a lot to Willie, see?

522
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:23,589
- New Year's Eve and everything, see?
- All right, if you insist.

523
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,947
It's mighty white of you.
Meet the rest of my party.

524
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:27,908
- How are you?
- Gentlemen, be seated.

525
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:31,428
- This is Willie. You remember Willie.
- How are you? Glad to see you.

526
00:35:31,528 --> 00:35:32,627
Likewise.

527
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:35,509
I am honored to be
at your coming out party.

528
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:38,187
- Nora, this is Willie the Weeper.
- Delighted.

529
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:39,474
Likewise.

530
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,227
- And the boys.
- How are you?

531
00:35:42,327 --> 00:35:43,666
How do you do?

532
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,947
- Do you boys know Dancer?
- I don't want to know him.

533
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:47,067
He's a crumb.

534
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:49,305
Don't say that, boys. He's giving the party.

535
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:51,029
- Everything's on the house.
- Yeah?

536
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:53,467
- That right?
- That's different. Why didn't you say so?

537
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,226
- Drinks and everything?
- Sure.

538
00:35:55,326 --> 00:35:56,826
- Champagne, boys.
- Me, too.

539
00:35:56,926 --> 00:35:58,426
Sure, champagne. Willie?

540
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:01,796
- Scotch, with a champagne chaser.
- Likewise.

541
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,064
Well, what do you say?

542
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:07,710
It wouldn't take much to make me
leave this town for good.

543
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,386
We could have a lot of fun on $25,000.

544
00:36:09,486 --> 00:36:11,827
What's the use talking about that?
You haven't got it.

545
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:12,947
Don't worry, I'll get it.

546
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:15,068
- When did he say he'd let you know?
- Tomorrow.

547
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:17,986
There's my number. I gotta go on.
Listen, go and call him now.

548
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:21,305
Don't let anybody hear you.
If he says he'll give it to you tonight...

549
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:23,550
I'll blow with you right away.

550
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,505
We got time for one more song, folks,
before the New Year.

551
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:31,388
Miss Polly Byrnes will sing a new
number for you, <i>Smoke Dreams.</i>

552
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,078
- Where's he going?
- Getting his hat and coat.

553
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,275
Say, get me mine, will you?

554
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,428
Boy, you can certainly pick them.

555
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:13,868
I never seen such a guy. Every time I meet
him he's got another good-looking gal.

556
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:16,589
- We haven't met for years.
- Oh?

557
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:19,346
When he gives you the sack,
let me know, will you?

558
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,998
I certainly will.

559
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,984
- She's hot looking, ain't she?
- Shut up, you lug. It's his wife.

560
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,084
See?

561
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,832
- Have you made up your mind?
- All right, I'll give you the money.

562
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,399
Tonight? I can't give it to you tonight.

563
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,827
I have some bonds that I was...

564
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:49,986
Of course they're negotiable.
Now, wait a minute. Just a minute.

565
00:37:50,086 --> 00:37:52,826
That's a lot of money.
How do I know you'll keep your promise?

566
00:37:52,926 --> 00:37:55,267
How do I know you'll really stay away?
And, even if...

567
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:58,468
Selma does decide to get a divorce,
how do I know you won't fight it?

568
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,358
All right, forget about it. I'll go on home.

569
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,433
Selma will be tickled to death to see me.

570
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,548
I'm at the Lichee Club. All right,
I'll meet you there in a couple of minutes.

571
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:14,916
Don't keep me waiting, though.
I might change my mind.

572
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,189
You know, it's all to the good,
them seeing him here plastered.

573
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:52,904
But we can't take a chance on them
tipping off his wife and having her bang in.

574
00:38:53,004 --> 00:38:54,752
- Make it snappy.
- Okay.

575
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,985
We want Polly! Where's Polly?

576
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,594
We want Polly.

577
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,667
We want Polly, see?

578
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,389
We come here and spend all this dough,
and what does she do?

579
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:07,789
She sings one song and quits.

580
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,067
Now, boys, she had to run along.

581
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,506
- Thanks.
- Glad to be of service.

582
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:14,745
That's what you get for coming
to a dapper joint like this.

583
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:17,065
Do you think she'll really take him home?

584
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:18,869
She'll take him somewhere, I'm sure.

585
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:20,024
What do you mean?

586
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,989
Did I ever tell you that you're
the most fascinating woman...

587
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:24,426
this side of the Rockies?

588
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:27,080
Wait till you see me on the other side.

589
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,267
I said to him, " You ain't gonna
give me a ticket, you big flatfoot...

590
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:35,027
"and you know it," I said. " I got the right
to turn there, you know it," I said.

591
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:38,548
"I ain't got all night to be sitting here
gassing. Go polish your buttons...

592
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:40,827
"leave me be on my way,
you fat palooka," I said.

593
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,388
I know, and then you busted our plan.

594
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,547
All right, thank you, Mr. Galahad.

595
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:55,864
You'll keep your promise?

596
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:57,785
You don't mind if I go home
for 10 minutes?

597
00:39:57,885 --> 00:39:59,269
- What for?
- Don't worry...

598
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,106
I won't see your precious Selma.

599
00:40:01,206 --> 00:40:02,829
I just want to get some clothes.

600
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:06,385
Ten minutes shouldn't matter to a man
who's waited as long as you have.

601
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:07,799
Well, ta-ta.

602
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:20,879
I'm worried.

603
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:25,084
I'm going to phone and see
if Robert got home.

604
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:28,514
I don't care whose wife she is.

605
00:40:28,614 --> 00:40:32,565
I don't like a dame that gets noisy
after she's had a few snifters.

606
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:37,513
- Don't you think I'd better?
- All right. But hurry, it's almost 12:00.

607
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:39,039
I'll be right back.

608
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:46,644
Here, get on that phone
and stay on it, hurry.

609
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:56,398
Well, that settles that.

610
00:40:56,846 --> 00:40:58,996
Never mind, they don't answer.

611
00:41:00,286 --> 00:41:03,164
I told her to take him straight to her place.

612
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:04,885
Mr. Landis?

613
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:06,766
Yeah.

614
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:10,636
I wanted her to get him in shape
so he could go home.

615
00:41:11,246 --> 00:41:13,513
Mr. Landis on phone.
I hear him say he go home.

616
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:15,164
He did? Good.

617
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:18,795
He's a relative of Mr. Charles.

618
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:23,436
I felt sort of responsible.

619
00:41:27,606 --> 00:41:31,599
I think I'll go out and get some
fresh air in one of my lungs.

620
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:35,084
Back in a minute.

621
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:05,195
Robert?

622
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,965
Hello, Selma.

623
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,992
- How are you?
- Where have you been?

624
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:13,354
Why do you do these things?
I've been going crazy.

625
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:17,121
- There, there, darling.
- No, I won't this time. I won't forgive you.

626
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:19,431
You're not going to make
a fool of me again.

627
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:23,678
All right, darling. I only came
for a moment to get some clothes.

628
00:42:24,286 --> 00:42:26,720
- Where are you going?
- A little trip.

629
00:42:28,606 --> 00:42:29,670
No, you're not.

630
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,643
I won't have it. I won't!

631
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:44,795
Want to kiss me goodbye, darling?

632
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:47,280
Thank you.

633
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:54,323
Selma, what's happened?

634
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:57,285
He was going away and I tried to stop him.

635
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:03,430
Now, Selma, listen to me. Now listen.

636
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,394
I want you to go back to the house.

637
00:44:05,494 --> 00:44:07,870
You've never had a pistol,
you understand? You hear me?

638
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,712
You've never been
out of the house tonight.

639
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:12,552
You don't know anything about this.
Understand?

640
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:13,652
Now, come on, hurry.

641
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:42,470
Happy New Year, everybody!

642
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,443
Happy New Year's...

643
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:47,116
Oh, excuse me.

644
00:44:47,216 --> 00:44:48,712
I guess there must be some mistake.

645
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:49,921
Oh, no.

646
00:44:51,726 --> 00:44:54,994
In the dark, and my wife said that
she'd be right back...

647
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:57,759
- and of course l...
- Oh, yeah?

648
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:04,563
Excuse me. Happy New Year.
Happy New Year to you, too.

649
00:45:07,766 --> 00:45:10,794
Nora, darling, sugar. Happy New Year.

650
00:45:10,894 --> 00:45:12,877
Nickie, you're bleeding.

651
00:45:13,686 --> 00:45:15,597
Yes, a little accident.

652
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:18,555
I know, this New Year's traffic is terrible,
isn't it?

653
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:20,711
Yes. Have you made any
New Year's resolutions?

654
00:45:20,811 --> 00:45:23,400
Not yet. Any complaints or suggestions?

655
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:25,439
- A few.
- Which?

656
00:45:25,646 --> 00:45:26,833
Complaints.

657
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,475
- All right, shoot.
- You don't scold, you don't nag.

658
00:45:30,966 --> 00:45:34,510
- You look far too pretty in the mornings.
- All right, I'll remember.

659
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,962
Must scold, must nag,
mustn't be too pretty in the mornings.

660
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:44,072
Happy New Year, baby.
Say, what are you doing here, anyway?

661
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:45,635
Still trying to call Selma.

662
00:45:45,735 --> 00:45:49,162
Well, what is it?
Come on, I'll find you a phone.

663
00:46:04,286 --> 00:46:07,323
Hello, Dancer. Come in.

664
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:10,001
Once a gumheel, always a gumheel.

665
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:13,202
Well, I don't like gumheels.

666
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:17,042
I thought you'd quit it when
you married a pot of money.

667
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,884
Did he call me a pot?

668
00:46:20,406 --> 00:46:22,790
You know I don't like to be critical,
Dancer, but...

669
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,792
you know, it doesn't look quite right
when you and your partner...

670
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:27,871
and your prima donna and
your best customer...

671
00:46:27,971 --> 00:46:29,392
all go out at the same time.

672
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:31,391
Gives the place a sort of vacant look.

673
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:34,762
Have you ever been thrown
out of a place, Mr. Charles?

674
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:38,316
Let's see, how many was it
up to yesterday, Mrs. Charles?

675
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:41,843
Well, how many places
have you been in, Mr. Charles?

676
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:45,803
Hello, Aunt Katherine? This is Nick...

677
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:48,037
I mean, Nicholas.

678
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:51,486
What?

679
00:46:52,886 --> 00:46:56,086
Oh, yes, I will.

680
00:47:00,566 --> 00:47:03,126
Well, now, if you're through in here...

681
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:07,444
Polly, another of our travellers,
has returned.

682
00:47:08,246 --> 00:47:09,725
Now if only...

683
00:47:11,566 --> 00:47:15,241
No sooner said than done.
Quite a gathering of the clans.

684
00:47:16,686 --> 00:47:19,874
I wonder which one of you would be
more surprised if Robert Landis...

685
00:47:19,974 --> 00:47:22,161
were to walk in here right now.

686
00:47:22,566 --> 00:47:26,031
Of course, you know that couldn't happen,
don't you, Dancer?

687
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:29,670
I don't know what you're talking about
and I don't care. Now get out of here.

688
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,405
- What is it, Nick?
- Robert's been killed.

689
00:47:33,406 --> 00:47:35,317
- Killed?
- Get out of here.

690
00:47:35,846 --> 00:47:38,635
No, on the contrary.
We're going to have a lot more people in.

691
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:41,194
- Give me that phone.
- Certainly.

692
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:44,557
- See?
- You better go. Selma may need you.

693
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:46,912
Hello, this is Nick Charles speaking...

694
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:49,875
I want to get hold of Lt. Abrams
of the Homicide Squad.

695
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:53,590
Why are you calling him?
It's a cinch none of us shot Landis.

696
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,405
Maybe to explain how you knew
he was shot.

697
00:48:10,966 --> 00:48:13,082
Hey, what are you doing there?

698
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:19,517
How did Mrs. Landis and her husband get
on together? Any fights, any arguments?

699
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:22,311
- No, sir.
- Mr. Abrahams...

700
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:25,993
- how dare you question my servants?
- Lady, a man's been killed.

701
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:28,593
- I got to find out who did it.
- Surely, you don't think...

702
00:48:28,693 --> 00:48:32,156
How do I know what to think
if nobody will tell me anything?

703
00:48:37,446 --> 00:48:40,751
Did you hear anyone leave the house
after Mr. Landis left?

704
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,873
Certainly not.

705
00:48:41,973 --> 00:48:45,271
- Will you please let him talk?
- Mr. Abrahams...

706
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:48,836
My name is Lt. Abrams. Well?

707
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:52,150
No, sir.

708
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:55,913
- All right, I'll see you all later.
- Obviously just a holdup.

709
00:48:56,013 --> 00:48:57,200
A holdup?

710
00:48:58,086 --> 00:49:01,035
With that bracelet
and those bonds left on him?

711
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:05,005
Henry, will you show Lt. Abrahamson out?

712
00:49:05,326 --> 00:49:07,513
Lady, I'm not going until I see Mrs. Landis.

713
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:11,592
Now look, I can't help it if
you don't like me. I'm just doing my duty.

714
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:14,315
I tell you Mrs. Landis cannot see anyone.

715
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:17,275
- She's under the care of a doctor.
- What's the doctor's name?

716
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,640
Dr. Kammer.

717
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:20,757
- Dr. Adolph Kammer?
- Yes.

718
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:24,118
- So that's the way it is.
- Precisely.

719
00:49:26,486 --> 00:49:29,073
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Lt. Abrams.

720
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:30,440
Okay, Doc.

721
00:49:30,686 --> 00:49:34,273
You're willing to take the responsibility
of not letting me talk to her?

722
00:49:34,373 --> 00:49:38,794
Sir, it's not a question of responsibility.
Mrs. Landis has had a very great shock.

723
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:41,755
It was necessary to give her
something to quiet her nerves.

724
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:44,273
- Can she talk to you in her sleep?
- When'll she be awake?

725
00:49:44,373 --> 00:49:45,430
Not for some hours.

726
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,996
Do you often have to give
Mrs. Landis things to quiet her?

727
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:52,842
Okay, Doc. Check that off.

728
00:49:52,966 --> 00:49:55,434
- Then is she crazy?
- You're insulting.

729
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:59,271
Lady, I've seen this guy
three times in my life...

730
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:04,042
and all three times he was on a witness
stand testifying that someone was nuts.

731
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:07,602
First there was that Mrs. Jerris.
Then, the Darrow woman.

732
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:10,833
- By golly, she shot her husband, too.
- Too?

733
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:13,724
What right have you
to say a thing like that?

734
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,234
In view of that very definite accusation,
I think that you should...

735
00:50:17,334 --> 00:50:21,232
insist that your attorney is present
at any future interviews with the police.

736
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:23,715
Anybody's tongue is liable to slip.

737
00:50:24,206 --> 00:50:26,314
Lt. Abrams, hurry...

738
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:29,551
Nick's waiting for you down at
the Lichee Club. He's got them all there.

739
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:30,673
What's happened?

740
00:50:30,773 --> 00:50:34,231
- He knows. He'll tell you everything.
- I hope somebody can tell me something.

741
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,913
- Where's Selma?
- She's sleeping. She's not to be disturbed.

742
00:50:37,013 --> 00:50:40,396
I won't disturb her.
But I want to be there when she wakes up.

743
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:44,126
Well?

744
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:47,676
I don't think that as yet
there is any reason for alarm.

745
00:50:57,886 --> 00:50:59,001
Selma?

746
00:51:00,606 --> 00:51:03,794
They're going to arrest me.
They're going to arrest me, aren't they?

747
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,553
- No. Of course they're not, dear.
- They all believe I did it.

748
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:09,674
Aunt Katherine, the doctor, all of them.

749
00:51:09,774 --> 00:51:14,123
- No, Selma, they don't think that at all.
- I heard them. I know.

750
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:18,955
- Now, darling.
- But I didn't kill him. I didn't.

751
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,079
I'm sure I didn't.

752
00:51:26,806 --> 00:51:30,640
- You'll help me, won't you, Nora?
- Why, of course, darling.

753
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:34,232
But you'd better lie down now
and get some rest.

754
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:36,434
They gave me some pills,
but I didn't take them.

755
00:51:36,534 --> 00:51:40,360
- You should have, dear. You need to sleep.
- No, I can't. I can't.

756
00:51:41,806 --> 00:51:45,037
- I've got to think. David.
- What about David?

757
00:51:45,446 --> 00:51:46,473
He thinks so, too.

758
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:51,074
- He must think so or he wouldn't have...
- He wouldn't have what?

759
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:55,035
Oh, nothing. You tell him I didn't.

760
00:51:55,135 --> 00:51:58,351
- Tell him I didn't do it.
- Darling, couldn't you telephone?

761
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:01,352
No. Someone might be listening.
No, you go to him.

762
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,563
- Tell him I didn't do it. Hurry!
- All right, I will.

763
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:31,513
<i>This is your news reporter speaking.</i>
<i>The old year was hardly out when death...</i>

764
00:52:31,613 --> 00:52:35,071
<i>struck savagely in the slaying of</i>
<i>Robert Landis, wealthy society playboy.</i>

765
00:52:35,171 --> 00:52:37,521
<i>Mystery surrounds the shooting...</i>

766
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,326
It's I, Nora.

767
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:48,084
Hello. This is a surprise. Is Nick with you?

768
00:52:52,246 --> 00:52:53,555
What's the matter?

769
00:52:53,655 --> 00:52:57,719
Just let me sit down.
Don't you know what's happened?

770
00:52:58,686 --> 00:52:59,914
No, what?

771
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:03,641
Well, first, Robert was killed.

772
00:53:04,406 --> 00:53:07,603
- He was killed?
- We saw him at the...

773
00:53:08,086 --> 00:53:09,113
David, look!

774
00:53:09,213 --> 00:53:11,393
That's the brother of the girl
who was with Robert!

775
00:53:11,493 --> 00:53:13,631
Don't let him get away,
he might know something.

776
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:16,320
I'll get him as he comes out the alley.

777
00:53:17,726 --> 00:53:20,313
Not so fast, buddy. Mr. Law speaking.

778
00:53:20,413 --> 00:53:23,364
Get inside there.
Who you got in there with you?

779
00:53:23,806 --> 00:53:26,190
Hey, you. Just a minute,
get out of that window.

780
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,074
What are you trying to do,
make a getaway?

781
00:53:28,174 --> 00:53:30,875
- There was someone on the fire escape.
- Where is he?

782
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:33,350
- He's gone now.
- All right then, come on, let's get going.

783
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,271
- This lady is...
- I know all about this lady.

784
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:38,714
I've been trailing her ever since
she left the Forrest house. Come on.

785
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:40,951
- Where are we going?
- We're going to headquarters.

786
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,350
There must be some mistake,
I'm Mrs. Nick Charles.

787
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,671
And I'm Mother Goose!
Step on it, girlie, let's go.

788
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:49,231
I've been trying to tell you for the last
half hour none of us had anything...

789
00:53:49,331 --> 00:53:50,353
Shut up, Dancer.

790
00:53:50,453 --> 00:53:53,554
If I want more of your chatter,
I'll ask for it. Let her talk. Go on.

791
00:53:53,654 --> 00:53:56,312
- I took him home like Dancer told me.
- Did you hear a shot?

792
00:53:56,412 --> 00:53:59,754
Well, I heard something,
like backfire from an automobile.

793
00:53:59,854 --> 00:54:03,231
It was foggy and I was too far away
to see anything.

794
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:05,471
I thought I'd better get out
of the neighborhood...

795
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:07,955
if I didn't want to get into trouble.

796
00:54:09,206 --> 00:54:11,872
Why don't you ask her
what she was too far away from?

797
00:54:11,972 --> 00:54:13,994
From wherever it was it happened.

798
00:54:14,094 --> 00:54:17,833
If I hadn't been too far away, I would
have known what it was, would I?

799
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:19,120
Well, l...

800
00:54:21,486 --> 00:54:24,558
- I give up.
- All right, Dancer. Where were you?

801
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:28,676
I went out to get some air.
What city ordinance does that break?

802
00:54:29,206 --> 00:54:32,403
- I went with him.
- Where did you go for all this air?

803
00:54:33,206 --> 00:54:37,916
Air pretty much same everywhere.
We go in my car. Ride around.

804
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,962
- Ask chauffeur.
- Riding around?

805
00:54:41,246 --> 00:54:46,001
New Year's Eve, the place is jammed
and you two are riding around.

806
00:54:46,886 --> 00:54:48,312
Hey, where do you think...

807
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:51,472
Just a minute, do you know who I am?
I came here to see a client.

808
00:54:51,572 --> 00:54:53,354
This is important business. Listen to me.

809
00:54:53,454 --> 00:54:55,960
- You can't do this to me.
- Hey, lay him down.

810
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:57,315
Hello, Casper.

811
00:54:57,446 --> 00:55:00,235
- He's our lawyer.
- I knew there'd be some shyster around.

812
00:55:00,335 --> 00:55:02,630
- Well, what is this?
- Do I know?

813
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:06,313
So a guy comes in and buys a drink.
He goes out and somebody kills him.

814
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:09,514
What are we supposed to do?
Give customers insurance with the drinks?

815
00:55:09,614 --> 00:55:11,235
Not a bad idea.

816
00:55:11,335 --> 00:55:14,993
I didn't recognize you, Mr. Charles.
Remember me, Floyd Casper?

817
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:17,077
Yes, how are you?

818
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:22,165
Always kidding.

819
00:55:22,806 --> 00:55:26,111
Why, Abrams, you don't think
that these people would have anything...

820
00:55:26,211 --> 00:55:28,314
to do with a thing like that?

821
00:55:28,414 --> 00:55:29,992
Why, I've known this lad since...

822
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:34,159
- Save that for the D.A. You got a gun?
- Sure. And a permit.

823
00:55:34,846 --> 00:55:35,846
You?

824
00:55:36,575 --> 00:55:38,471
If you want to take those,
we'd like a receipt.

825
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:41,472
Tell that shyster to shut up
or you'll go to the Hall of Justice.

826
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:43,791
- On what charges?
- Witnesses. They ask them questions.

827
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:46,473
Your clients spend
nine-tenths of the time doing it.

828
00:55:46,573 --> 00:55:49,515
Take these down and check them
with the bullet that killed Landis.

829
00:55:49,615 --> 00:55:53,150
- Hold it a minute. You. You got a gun?
- No.

830
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,273
What did you do with it?

831
00:55:54,373 --> 00:55:55,430
I never had one.

832
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,511
Nobody has anything,
nobody knows anything.

833
00:55:57,611 --> 00:55:58,915
All right, go ahead.

834
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:01,600
Miss Byrnes has a brother who has a gun.

835
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:04,955
And my chauffeur tells me
that he hung around outside...

836
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:07,350
until just about the time
she and Landis left.

837
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,713
If he was there,
he was hanging around waiting for me.

838
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:13,234
He wouldn't kill Robert, Mr. Charles.
He wouldn't have no reason.

839
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:16,045
I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just talking.

840
00:56:16,446 --> 00:56:19,554
I think you ought to find him.
At least he might give his version...

841
00:56:19,654 --> 00:56:21,035
as to why Dancer threw him out.

842
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:23,313
If that rat tries
to hang anything on me, I'll...

843
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,274
- Leave my brother out of this.
- Take it easy.

844
00:56:25,374 --> 00:56:27,431
They want to get you
at each other's throats.

845
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:29,511
Answer what you wanna
and don't let them get you.

846
00:56:29,611 --> 00:56:33,679
- I can't stand that shyster.
- I was beginning to suspect that.

847
00:56:35,086 --> 00:56:37,795
- Did you call me, Nick?
- No, not yet, Harold.

848
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:42,277
But you ought to stick around.
Outside. It's pretty close in here.

849
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:46,150
Where is this brother of yours
that didn't kill anyone?

850
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,115
He lives in a hotel on Turk Street.
I don't know just where.

851
00:56:49,215 --> 00:56:50,712
Don't know much of anything, do you?

852
00:56:50,812 --> 00:56:53,313
I honestly don't know which hotel.
Phil is always moving.

853
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:56,072
Does he have to move
every time he don't kill someone?

854
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:58,839
Don't be so funny! You got me in stitches.

855
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:03,878
Stay where you are, everybody.
Get that switch!

856
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:06,365
I'll get it, Nick.

857
00:57:15,206 --> 00:57:16,406
Hello.

858
00:57:18,766 --> 00:57:21,166
Hello. What?

859
00:57:22,446 --> 00:57:25,563
Can't hear you,
so much noise going on around here.

860
00:57:27,806 --> 00:57:31,685
Headquarters?
This is Nick Charles speaking.

861
00:57:32,246 --> 00:57:34,673
Take it easy, will you, fellas,
I can't hear a thing here.

862
00:57:34,773 --> 00:57:39,274
Dancer just got away. Yeah.
Tell the boys to pick him up, will you?

863
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,032
It's all right, Nick, I got him.

864
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:44,084
Wait a minute,
my chauffeur thinks he's got him.

865
00:57:45,446 --> 00:57:47,032
The old Gotch toe hold.

866
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:50,482
Hello. No, it's Abrams he's got.

867
00:57:50,686 --> 00:57:52,911
Harold, you better let him up,
he may not like that.

868
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,758
Say, what's the idea?

869
00:57:55,286 --> 00:57:58,119
- Take it easy, lady.
- Let go of me, will you?

870
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:10,553
What do you think you're doing?

871
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,270
Lights went out. You want me to stand
out there while Nick might be in trouble?

872
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,234
- What was the shooting?
- I guess it was me.

873
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:17,353
Did you get him?

874
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:21,315
I thought it was him coming through
the door. It was only me in that mirror.

875
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,681
And I want...

876
00:58:24,726 --> 00:58:27,313
I want to have a description
of that brother of yours.

877
00:58:27,413 --> 00:58:30,472
What're you picking on Phil for?
What about Mrs. Landis killing him?

878
00:58:30,572 --> 00:58:32,551
Maybe she found out
we was going away together.

879
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:35,196
Maybe she found out about
that Graham giving him the bonds.

880
00:58:35,296 --> 00:58:38,431
- Don't talk till you get legal advice.
- You're their lawyer, not mine!

881
00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:40,591
How do I know you won't leave me
holding the bag.

882
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:43,635
We're getting somewhere.
Pick up Mrs. Landis, doctor or no doctor.

883
00:58:43,735 --> 00:58:46,718
- We're going down to headquarters.
- You can't do that!

884
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,115
What's the idea, anyway?

885
00:58:50,215 --> 00:58:51,215
No.

886
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:54,631
All it sounds like to me is they picked up
my wife in a man's apartment.

887
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,718
- Say it again.
- That's it. That's what she says.

888
00:58:58,006 --> 00:59:00,556
- I've never seen your wife myself.
- Let me talk to him.

889
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:04,792
Graham. David Graham. Hold him? Okay.

890
00:59:04,892 --> 00:59:08,713
- Why, this is all crazy, that can't be Nick.
- It's him, all right.

891
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:12,560
- Tell him it's Nora.
- She says to say it's Nora, Mr. Charles.

892
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:14,526
Nora?

893
00:59:15,126 --> 00:59:17,515
No, sounds like a phony to me.

894
00:59:17,926 --> 00:59:21,282
Better throw her in the fish tank
till I get down there.

895
00:59:22,606 --> 00:59:24,437
- Right.
- Well?

896
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:28,234
- Throw her in the fish tank.
- What? Why...

897
00:59:28,334 --> 00:59:31,318
- Throw her in the fish tank.
- Why of all the...

898
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:38,759
Will you open this door or will I kick it in?

899
00:59:46,846 --> 00:59:50,475
What did I tell you about horning in
on somebody else's game?

900
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:55,558
All right, Matron.

901
00:59:56,846 --> 01:00:00,433
How do you do? I'd like to get this gal
out of the woman's tank.

902
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:04,724
Oh, yes. Is this the one that was doing
the fan dance?

903
01:00:05,286 --> 01:00:06,430
- Fan dance?
- Yes.

904
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,954
- If it is, she's been holding out on me.
- Hi, there. Say, are you a lawyer?

905
01:00:10,054 --> 01:00:13,234
Did Mr. Feinberg send you?

906
01:00:13,334 --> 01:00:15,673
Keep quiet! Who are you looking for?

907
01:00:15,773 --> 01:00:17,352
Bail us out of here.

908
01:00:17,452 --> 01:00:19,910
- Do you see her?
- No, I guess she isn't here.

909
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:24,674
Nickie, here I am. Excuse me.
Wait a minute. Wait. Excuse me.

910
01:00:24,774 --> 01:00:26,324
- What?
- Here I am.

911
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:30,195
Well, this is a fine way
to start the New Year.

912
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:31,393
Get me out of here.

913
01:00:31,493 --> 01:00:33,551
How long has this thing
with David been going on?

914
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:35,833
Stop. Get me out of here.
I've something to tell you.

915
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,272
- About the case?
- Yes.

916
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:38,792
I'll get you out on one condition.

917
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:40,994
No more detecting, no more cases.
Promise?

918
01:00:41,094 --> 01:00:42,395
But this is important.

919
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:43,795
- Never mind.
- Nick!

920
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:45,956
- Well?
- I promise.

921
01:00:46,526 --> 01:00:49,120
- All right, let her out.
- Come on, miss.

922
01:00:54,646 --> 01:00:56,152
- Are you Mrs. Charles?
- Yes.

923
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,114
Lt. Abrams wants you for questioning.

924
01:00:58,214 --> 01:00:59,632
- Questioning?
- Yeah.

925
01:00:59,732 --> 01:01:02,798
Don't worry, darling.
I'll write to you every day.

926
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:07,792
- Were you and Landis on good terms?
- Decidedly not.

927
01:01:07,892 --> 01:01:09,711
- On bad terms?
- Very bad.

928
01:01:09,811 --> 01:01:12,712
- You and Mrs. Landis were once engaged.
- That's right.

929
01:01:12,812 --> 01:01:15,073
- Until Landis came along?
- Yes, sir.

930
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:17,673
Ever ask her to divorce him
and marry you?

931
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:20,874
- I may have. But she never said she would.
- But you hoped she would...

932
01:01:20,974 --> 01:01:24,074
and you thought that with him
out of the way she might.

933
01:01:24,174 --> 01:01:27,471
- Now look, I didn't kill Robert.
- Did I say you did?

934
01:01:27,571 --> 01:01:30,392
- But you did pay him to go away.
- Yes, I did.

935
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:31,839
Let them in.

936
01:01:33,806 --> 01:01:36,393
Will you please sit down, Mrs. Charles.

937
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:41,111
I have to ask your wife a couple
of questions, Mr. Charles. I'm sorry.

938
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:44,084
- That's quite all right.
- Now, Mrs. Charles...

939
01:01:44,606 --> 01:01:47,235
why did you go to
Mr. Graham's apartment?

940
01:01:47,335 --> 01:01:51,001
- Why...
- Perhaps I'd better leave.

941
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:56,710
Why, Selma had a silly idea
that David thought she killed Robert.

942
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,951
She wanted me to go
and tell him that she didn't.

943
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:02,834
Now, wait a minute. I can't imagine her
thinking a thing like that.

944
01:02:04,086 --> 01:02:06,955
That's ridiculous,
I haven't seen her for two days.

945
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:11,597
- Will you come in, Mrs. Landis?
- Dear, sit down.

946
01:02:15,686 --> 01:02:17,714
David, I didn't want you dragged into this.

947
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:21,553
Mrs. Landis, why did Mr. Graham
think you killed...

948
01:02:21,653 --> 01:02:24,030
I never said that and I never thought it
for a minute.

949
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:25,595
It's all right, David.

950
01:02:25,695 --> 01:02:29,838
You have every right to think I did it.
He's just trying to protect me.

951
01:02:30,286 --> 01:02:33,314
He heard a shot,
came running up to me and...

952
01:02:33,414 --> 01:02:36,955
Just a minute.
What were you doing there?

953
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:40,563
I wanted to make sure that he kept
his promise to go away.

954
01:02:41,366 --> 01:02:42,719
Okay, go on.

955
01:02:43,806 --> 01:02:48,075
He rushed to me and found me standing
near Robert with a gun in my hand.

956
01:02:48,175 --> 01:02:51,795
But the shot came from around the corner,
from in front of me.

957
01:02:52,246 --> 01:02:54,157
You mean you didn't...

958
01:02:54,326 --> 01:02:58,285
No. Look at the gun, David,
it hasn't been fired.

959
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:04,999
Selma, forgive me.

960
01:03:05,806 --> 01:03:08,313
It's all right, David. Of course I forgive you.

961
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:12,073
Well, that's all settled. Come on, Nora.
Goodbye, Lieutenant. Goodbye, all.

962
01:03:12,173 --> 01:03:13,838
Now, wait a minute.

963
01:03:14,326 --> 01:03:16,513
Maybe, he believes you.
He's in love with you.

964
01:03:16,613 --> 01:03:19,911
But I got to have something more
than that. Where's the gun?

965
01:03:20,011 --> 01:03:23,760
- I've got to see that gun, Mrs. Landis.
- I haven't got the gun.

966
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:27,763
I gave it to David. David, where's the...

967
01:03:29,526 --> 01:03:33,838
- What is it, David?
- Selma, I thought you were guilty.

968
01:03:34,726 --> 01:03:38,632
I thought I was doing the only thing...
I threw the gun away.

969
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,557
You threw the gun away?

970
01:03:42,606 --> 01:03:44,394
This is the craziest case.

971
01:03:44,494 --> 01:03:47,355
But they can find it.
I can tell them exactly where I threw it.

972
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,835
I'll send divers down for it and...

973
01:03:50,006 --> 01:03:51,193
They've got to find it!

974
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:53,553
She don't want that gun back
anymore than you do.

975
01:03:53,653 --> 01:03:57,924
Swear out a warrant for the arrest of
Mrs. Landis on suspicion of murder.

976
01:03:58,966 --> 01:04:02,402
- Get some whiskey.
- Yes, sir.

977
01:04:02,646 --> 01:04:04,125
For both of us.

978
01:04:11,686 --> 01:04:14,962
And that goes for you, too. Go on.

979
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:19,838
What did you say?

980
01:05:21,766 --> 01:05:24,230
Did you say something
about scrambled eggs?

981
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,794
No, darling, you must have been dreaming.

982
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:30,795
Are you hungry?

983
01:05:30,895 --> 01:05:34,481
No, why?
You want some scrambled eggs, dear?

984
01:05:35,246 --> 01:05:39,683
- I can fix them for you if you want them.
- No, darling, I don't care for any.

985
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:42,398
- Sure?
- Really.

986
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,756
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

987
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:53,121
After all, if I want scrambled eggs
I can get them for myself.

988
01:05:54,726 --> 01:05:57,524
Of course, I'm not as good
a cook as you are.

989
01:05:57,886 --> 01:06:01,322
Don't bother about me.
You go right on sleeping, darling.

990
01:06:01,606 --> 01:06:03,597
I love to watch you sleep.

991
01:06:04,726 --> 01:06:06,284
You look so cute.

992
01:06:09,846 --> 01:06:13,361
Nickie, have you any pictures
of yourself taken as a baby?

993
01:06:14,726 --> 01:06:17,286
- No.
- That's a shame.

994
01:06:18,366 --> 01:06:20,755
I want to see what you looked like.

995
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:23,885
I'll have some taken in the morning.

996
01:06:26,006 --> 01:06:28,998
Poor Selma, poor David.

997
01:06:31,966 --> 01:06:34,275
Nickie, can you reach the water?

998
01:06:35,926 --> 01:06:37,837
Can you reach the water?

999
01:06:43,206 --> 01:06:47,518
No, I just... I don't want it.
I just wanted to be sure you could reach it.

1000
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:55,918
Come on. I'll scramble those eggs.

1001
01:07:00,046 --> 01:07:03,154
If you can manage the bread,
I'll whip you up some scrambled eggs...

1002
01:07:03,254 --> 01:07:04,555
that'll be a poem.

1003
01:07:04,655 --> 01:07:07,754
- I'm so glad you're hungry, too.
- Here, chase this.

1004
01:07:07,854 --> 01:07:10,235
No, this. Go get it.

1005
01:07:12,246 --> 01:07:15,124
Eggs, milk, butter.

1006
01:07:17,686 --> 01:07:19,836
Now, what's the matter?

1007
01:07:20,486 --> 01:07:23,275
I'm thinking of poor Selma
down in that jail.

1008
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,591
Don't worry.
Tomorrow they'll find the gun...

1009
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:28,475
and it won't have been fired
and Selma will be set free. A bowl.

1010
01:07:28,575 --> 01:07:30,993
- Then you don't really think she did it?
- No.

1011
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:33,273
- Now, where's the salt?
- Over there.

1012
01:07:33,373 --> 01:07:36,714
You're not saying that just to make me
happy, are you? You really mean it?

1013
01:07:36,814 --> 01:07:38,152
- No.
- No, what?

1014
01:07:38,252 --> 01:07:39,273
No pepper.

1015
01:07:39,373 --> 01:07:42,483
- It's there next to the salt.
- Thanks.

1016
01:07:44,366 --> 01:07:45,685
Then, what?

1017
01:07:46,326 --> 01:07:48,833
- Yes, I mean it.
- Of course you're right.

1018
01:07:48,933 --> 01:07:51,193
She didn't do it. She couldn't have done it.

1019
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:54,634
I don't think I'd kill you
if you ran off with another woman.

1020
01:07:54,734 --> 01:07:58,036
- Well, that's something to look forward to.
- I might, though.

1021
01:07:59,966 --> 01:08:01,797
Do you mind, sugar?

1022
01:08:08,886 --> 01:08:12,003
- Don't forget to shut the gate.
- Nick, what was it?

1023
01:08:12,406 --> 01:08:15,603
It was a stone.
Look, it's got a note tied to it.

1024
01:08:16,006 --> 01:08:18,556
Silly little woman.
I told her to stop writing me.

1025
01:08:18,656 --> 01:08:20,443
Asta, drop that.

1026
01:08:23,606 --> 01:08:25,836
Asta, drop that, that's a clue.

1027
01:08:28,806 --> 01:08:31,684
He thinks we're playing.
Nickie, come help me.

1028
01:08:35,006 --> 01:08:36,475
- Look at him.
- Where is he?

1029
01:08:36,575 --> 01:08:37,885
Over there.

1030
01:08:39,566 --> 01:08:43,036
- Has he got the N-O-T-E?
- Yes.

1031
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:47,122
Don't pay any attention to him.
Just be nonchalant.

1032
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:21,950
- Asta!
- Darling, let me, just a moment.

1033
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:23,050
Asta.

1034
01:09:25,486 --> 01:09:27,363
Come here, this minute.

1035
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,721
Do you hear me? This minute.

1036
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:39,111
Never mind me. Get him!

1037
01:09:39,211 --> 01:09:41,211
Yes. Asta!

1038
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:58,282
- Did you get it?
- Got the rock.

1039
01:10:00,046 --> 01:10:03,074
- Nick, he's eating it up!
- Asta.

1040
01:10:03,174 --> 01:10:06,551
Here, look! Pretty rock.

1041
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:08,551
Get the pretty rock. Here, boy.

1042
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:10,754
Asta, look. See the pretty rock.

1043
01:10:10,854 --> 01:10:12,911
When he runs after the rock,
you grab the paper.

1044
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:16,362
Get it, Asta. Get the pretty rock.
That's a good doggie.

1045
01:10:19,246 --> 01:10:20,565
I have it.

1046
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:24,804
"Mr. Charles...

1047
01:10:25,886 --> 01:10:29,111
"Phil Byrnes, alias Ralph West...

1048
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:31,481
"is a ex-con...

1049
01:10:32,606 --> 01:10:35,837
"and was married to Polly in Topeker...

1050
01:10:36,686 --> 01:10:38,119
"three years ago.

1051
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:40,244
"He lives..."

1052
01:10:46,606 --> 01:10:48,953
What are we to do,
send them an anniversary present?

1053
01:10:49,053 --> 01:10:50,435
Nickie, phone Abrams.

1054
01:10:50,535 --> 01:10:52,554
And have him here,
keeping us up all night?

1055
01:10:52,654 --> 01:10:56,350
Don't you see? If Phil is her husband,
then he shot Robert...

1056
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,910
because he found out about him and Polly.

1057
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:00,598
Nickie, you must phone.

1058
01:11:01,286 --> 01:11:04,517
- Just as you say.
- Here, you.

1059
01:11:08,366 --> 01:11:11,192
Bad Asta. You swallowed that address.
How could you?

1060
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:14,596
And I've been boasting about
what a smart dog you were.

1061
01:11:14,926 --> 01:11:17,201
Just for that, you sleep outside.

1062
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:57,195
Nickie?

1063
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:54,432
I don't think Mr. Charles
wishes to see anyone.

1064
01:12:54,532 --> 01:12:57,438
You just tell Mr. Charles I'm here,
that's all.

1065
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:05,472
Good morning, Peters.
Mrs. Charles couldn't sleep, so I'm up.

1066
01:13:05,572 --> 01:13:07,791
- Good morning, Peters.
- Good evening, madam.

1067
01:13:07,891 --> 01:13:10,480
Good evening? Why, it's only 6:30.

1068
01:13:11,006 --> 01:13:12,512
- Yes, sir.
- It's still dark.

1069
01:13:12,612 --> 01:13:14,953
It's dark again, sir.
You slept right through the day.

1070
01:13:15,053 --> 01:13:17,514
- Was it a nice day?
- A dreadful day, madam.

1071
01:13:17,646 --> 01:13:20,110
The reporters and the police were
trying to get up here.

1072
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:23,431
- I guess we didn't miss a thing.
- Quick, the morning papers.

1073
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:26,235
- The morning paper's not out, madam.
- Not out yet?

1074
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,194
- These are the evening papers.
- Oh.

1075
01:13:28,294 --> 01:13:29,350
Here you are.

1076
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:32,033
It doesn't seem right,
the evening papers with breakfast.

1077
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:35,633
If you hadn't wakened me,
we'd have slept right through till morning.

1078
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:38,675
Mr. Charles, there's one of those
policemen outside the door now.

1079
01:13:38,775 --> 01:13:40,395
- What shall I do about it?
- Show him in.

1080
01:13:40,495 --> 01:13:42,594
He probably wants to question
Mrs. Charles again.

1081
01:13:42,694 --> 01:13:45,246
It doesn't say whether they've found
the gun.

1082
01:13:46,126 --> 01:13:48,162
Oh, I forgot. I'm mad at you.

1083
01:13:49,566 --> 01:13:52,364
Look at him prancing around
with that clue in him!

1084
01:13:53,326 --> 01:13:54,752
Hello, Mr. Abrams.

1085
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:56,677
- Good morning.
- Good evening.

1086
01:13:57,086 --> 01:13:58,353
Yes, good evening.

1087
01:13:58,453 --> 01:14:01,033
- Will you have some breakfast?
- Thanks. I just had dinner.

1088
01:14:01,133 --> 01:14:02,605
I give up.

1089
01:14:02,966 --> 01:14:04,515
- Have they found the gun?
- No.

1090
01:14:04,615 --> 01:14:05,633
Oh, Nick.

1091
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,594
Will you convict her if you don't find it?

1092
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:12,433
Maybe I do and maybe I don't.
It's what the D.A. Thinks.

1093
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:15,714
What about the other guns?
Dancer's and Lum Kee's?

1094
01:14:15,814 --> 01:14:18,190
They're.38s, like he was killed with.

1095
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,713
But the experts say
they're not the guns that did it.

1096
01:14:20,813 --> 01:14:23,515
$50 will get you $250 that she didn't do it.

1097
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,714
You'd have to say that, you're family.

1098
01:14:25,814 --> 01:14:28,843
But that Lichee gang
has got the best out in the world.

1099
01:14:28,966 --> 01:14:31,473
They wouldn't have killed him
until they cashed his check.

1100
01:14:31,573 --> 01:14:33,950
- His check?
- I forgot, you didn't hear about that.

1101
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,050
No.

1102
01:14:35,173 --> 01:14:37,353
He gave Polly a check
for $20,000 yesterday.

1103
01:14:37,453 --> 01:14:39,713
$20,000?
Robert never had $20,000 in his life.

1104
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:43,031
Yes, he did. I went to the bank
to see about it. Here it is.

1105
01:14:43,131 --> 01:14:44,595
His wife put this in his account...

1106
01:14:44,695 --> 01:14:45,713
just a few days ago.

1107
01:14:45,813 --> 01:14:47,834
It looks all right.
Have you any of his checks?

1108
01:14:47,934 --> 01:14:51,071
- I got all of his and they're okay.
- I want the ones he gave to Polly.

1109
01:14:51,171 --> 01:14:52,991
Here's the first one for $75.

1110
01:14:53,091 --> 01:14:55,795
- $75, that's better.
- Here's the next one for $100.

1111
01:14:55,895 --> 01:14:57,877
$100. Going up, huh?

1112
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:06,235
Perfect.

1113
01:15:06,446 --> 01:15:08,671
- Forgery.
- Let me have the big check.

1114
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:11,234
Let me see. I've never seen a forged check.

1115
01:15:14,326 --> 01:15:15,520
There you are.

1116
01:15:15,926 --> 01:15:18,193
- How will you have your eggs?
- Where's your phone?

1117
01:15:18,293 --> 01:15:21,676
- It's on the table between the beds.
- I can't see anything!

1118
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,595
- Where's the rest of this phone?
- It's in the drawer.

1119
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:29,804
Hey, nice doggie. Will you tell him
I just want to use the phone?

1120
01:15:30,886 --> 01:15:33,605
Now behave yourself, will you? Look out.

1121
01:15:36,326 --> 01:15:39,392
I don't understand,
the signatures look exactly alike to me.

1122
01:15:39,492 --> 01:15:41,681
- That's just it.
- That's just what?

1123
01:15:42,286 --> 01:15:44,633
Nobody writes this much the same, twice.

1124
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:47,524
They traced these signatures
from his first check.

1125
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:54,395
Hello. Hello, Joe?

1126
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:57,230
Go down and pick up
that Polly Byrnes for me.

1127
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:58,330
Okay.

1128
01:15:59,126 --> 01:16:01,799
Do you want this thing
back in the drawer?

1129
01:16:01,966 --> 01:16:03,558
No, that's all right.

1130
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,953
Will you call this bloodhound off,
so I can get out?

1131
01:16:08,053 --> 01:16:10,074
Asta, come here.

1132
01:16:10,174 --> 01:16:12,470
Don't you know Mr. Abrams
is on our side?

1133
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:16,036
What's the matter with you on this case?
You're losing your grip.

1134
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,033
Get Dancer yet?

1135
01:16:18,133 --> 01:16:19,755
He showed up as soon as it was light.

1136
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:22,954
Had a story about not wanting to
be around when the shooting started.

1137
01:16:23,054 --> 01:16:24,110
Him without his gun.

1138
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:26,197
- What about Phil? Found him?
- No.

1139
01:16:26,646 --> 01:16:29,472
Somebody threw this
through our window, last night.

1140
01:16:29,572 --> 01:16:31,796
- Where's the rest of it?
- Asta ate it.

1141
01:16:32,566 --> 01:16:35,717
- Polly said it was a hotel on Turk Street.
- That's right.

1142
01:16:36,486 --> 01:16:38,954
Say, do you want to give it a try with me?

1143
01:16:39,086 --> 01:16:41,194
Yes, if you'll give me
a few minutes to dress.

1144
01:16:41,294 --> 01:16:43,234
Yes, you wait downstairs.
We'll be right down.

1145
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:44,998
Hey, wait a minute.

1146
01:16:46,046 --> 01:16:49,118
- Where do you get that "we" stuff?
- I'm coming with you.

1147
01:16:49,326 --> 01:16:50,672
Not cured yet, huh?

1148
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,635
Certainly not. Don't worry, darling.
I won't be in the way.

1149
01:16:53,735 --> 01:16:57,002
Why, of course you won't.
I just want to make sure.

1150
01:16:57,526 --> 01:17:00,326
Nick! You dog!

1151
01:17:02,086 --> 01:17:03,155
Let me out!

1152
01:17:08,846 --> 01:17:12,043
You stay here
in case he tries to make a break.

1153
01:17:22,606 --> 01:17:25,272
- Is Phil Byrnes in?
- We ain't got no Phil Byrnes.

1154
01:17:25,372 --> 01:17:26,995
- Have you got a Ralph West?
- Yes.

1155
01:17:27,095 --> 01:17:28,592
- Is he in?
- I don't know.

1156
01:17:28,692 --> 01:17:30,192
Any way of finding out?

1157
01:17:30,292 --> 01:17:32,590
Walk upstairs if you want. Room 212.

1158
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,324
Get on the back stairs.

1159
01:17:49,726 --> 01:17:51,523
Telegram for Mr. West.

1160
01:17:53,326 --> 01:17:54,884
After you, my dear Lieutenant.

1161
01:18:08,646 --> 01:18:10,443
Dead, all right. Strangled.

1162
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:13,485
And beaten up some
before the strangling set in.

1163
01:18:18,086 --> 01:18:19,485
Someone's hair in his hand.

1164
01:18:21,486 --> 01:18:22,760
Watch out.

1165
01:18:22,966 --> 01:18:24,871
A pair of spectacles.

1166
01:18:24,971 --> 01:18:27,712
I'll have the boys phone,
we'll give this room a good casing.

1167
01:18:27,812 --> 01:18:30,270
Here's another.38
for your experts to match up.

1168
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:34,150
I guess the heater is his, all right.
He's wearing an empty shoulder holster.

1169
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,912
I guess this is the key
to that Byrnes girl's apartment.

1170
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,475
It's got her number stamped on it.

1171
01:18:38,575 --> 01:18:41,594
Another good guess would be
that Selma Landis didn't do this.

1172
01:18:41,694 --> 01:18:44,033
Fair enough.
But he wasn't killed the way Landis was.

1173
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:47,234
Tell me what your laboratory says
about that hair and those cheaters.

1174
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:49,551
- Okay. Anything else on your mind?
- Yes, that key.

1175
01:18:49,651 --> 01:18:51,950
- Could I borrow it for about an hour?
- Sure.

1176
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:54,154
How about your skeleton key
just for good measure?

1177
01:18:54,254 --> 01:18:57,522
All right. Say, what are you looking for?

1178
01:18:57,806 --> 01:19:00,274
I haven't the faintest idea. Just a hunch.

1179
01:19:00,926 --> 01:19:05,602
This is straight from the feed bag. They
just found Phil's body strangled to death.

1180
01:19:05,966 --> 01:19:07,399
Say, that's tough.

1181
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:10,640
Polly's gonna feel bad. Thanks.

1182
01:19:16,686 --> 01:19:19,883
- Polly in yet?
- No. Police here, looking for her.

1183
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:23,474
Stall them. Keep them here.
I'm going up to her place. I'll be back soon.

1184
01:19:23,574 --> 01:19:25,363
Get out there.

1185
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,804
Wait, brother.

1186
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:30,917
Say, what is this? Bank Night?

1187
01:25:40,766 --> 01:25:41,953
Flash news bulletin.

1188
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:45,314
<i>A body believed to be that of the janitor</i>
<i>was found in a hamper...</i>

1189
01:25:45,414 --> 01:25:47,115
<i>in the basement of 346 White Street.</i>

1190
01:25:47,215 --> 01:25:49,925
<i>Police link this murder with</i>
<i>the Landis killing.</i>

1191
01:25:50,126 --> 01:25:53,960
Read all about the big murder!

1192
01:26:08,086 --> 01:26:10,636
Sorry to have to ask you to come to
a place like this, but...

1193
01:26:10,736 --> 01:26:12,435
Is it Nick? Where is he? Is he hurt?

1194
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:15,235
No, he's all right. He's upstairs.
I called you here because...

1195
01:26:15,335 --> 01:26:17,231
we found the janitor's body here.

1196
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:20,275
Been dead about 24 hours.
Shot near the phone, there.

1197
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:24,837
The telephone company tells us that about
7:30 last night, just before he was shot...

1198
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:28,790
someone here called up information and
asked for Nick Charles' number.

1199
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:31,798
Mr. Charles doesn't remember
this Pedro Dominguez...

1200
01:26:32,006 --> 01:26:34,992
- and I thought perhaps you might be...
- Pedro Dominguez?

1201
01:26:35,092 --> 01:26:38,601
He was my father's gardener,
about six years ago.

1202
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:42,116
- A small man with a mustache?
- Yeah, that's the one.

1203
01:26:44,606 --> 01:26:48,235
Hello? Just a minute.
Call for you, Lieutenant.

1204
01:26:48,366 --> 01:26:51,075
Would you mind going down
and taking a look, just to make sure?

1205
01:26:51,175 --> 01:26:52,193
Certainly not.

1206
01:26:52,293 --> 01:26:54,800
- Would you take Mrs. Charles...
- Right.

1207
01:26:55,006 --> 01:26:56,033
Hello.

1208
01:26:56,133 --> 01:27:00,119
Those glasses you found in Phil Byrnes'
place are nothing but window pane.

1209
01:27:00,366 --> 01:27:04,644
The hair is false and the gun
is not the one that was used on Landis.

1210
01:27:04,846 --> 01:27:06,757
You're a great help.

1211
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:09,552
Did you find out about the fingerprints
in his room?

1212
01:27:09,652 --> 01:27:10,840
Dancer's, eh?

1213
01:27:11,246 --> 01:27:14,397
Well, that helps a little. No others? Okay.

1214
01:27:15,886 --> 01:27:19,633
Get to work on this case. And take a look
at the bullet that killed this guy.

1215
01:27:19,733 --> 01:27:20,761
Thanks.

1216
01:27:27,086 --> 01:27:29,805
Funny you didn't recognize
this Pedro Dominguez.

1217
01:27:30,206 --> 01:27:31,755
Why, does Nora know him?

1218
01:27:31,855 --> 01:27:34,273
Yeah, he used to be her father's gardener.

1219
01:27:34,373 --> 01:27:35,872
Remember him now?

1220
01:27:35,972 --> 01:27:38,952
Who ever remembers a gardener
unless he squirts a hose at you?

1221
01:27:39,052 --> 01:27:41,393
- Hold this a minute, will you?
- What is it?

1222
01:27:41,493 --> 01:27:42,832
You'll see in a minute.

1223
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:45,645
Think Mrs. Landis might know this Pedro?

1224
01:27:46,286 --> 01:27:48,402
- She might.
- And that Aunt Katherine?

1225
01:27:48,686 --> 01:27:49,880
Possible.

1226
01:27:50,126 --> 01:27:51,835
What do you think you're doing?

1227
01:27:51,935 --> 01:27:54,360
There it is. Hold that, will you?

1228
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,070
Well, what do you know about that?
A ladder.

1229
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:58,170
Sure.

1230
01:27:58,366 --> 01:27:59,872
$50 will get you $250 that...

1231
01:27:59,972 --> 01:28:02,074
it just reaches down
to Polly's apartment below.

1232
01:28:02,174 --> 01:28:04,513
With this left over for good measure
when he got there.

1233
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:06,324
- Let's try it.
- Sure.

1234
01:28:08,966 --> 01:28:10,684
All right. This end first.

1235
01:28:19,286 --> 01:28:20,480
How about it?

1236
01:28:20,606 --> 01:28:22,032
- You're right.
- Yeah.

1237
01:28:22,132 --> 01:28:24,393
What did you find out about
the person who was here?

1238
01:28:24,493 --> 01:28:28,153
Not a thing, not a fingerprint in the room,
not a stitch of clothes, nothing.

1239
01:28:28,253 --> 01:28:29,353
Anything in Pedro's books?

1240
01:28:29,453 --> 01:28:33,395
Just that someone named Anderson
took it a week ago, paid cash in advance.

1241
01:28:33,495 --> 01:28:34,593
That's all, huh?

1242
01:28:34,693 --> 01:28:37,911
There's a record of a new lock on the door.
Bought it yesterday.

1243
01:28:38,011 --> 01:28:40,593
Wait a minute,
what does the card on the door say?

1244
01:28:40,693 --> 01:28:42,358
That won't help you much.

1245
01:28:44,246 --> 01:28:45,912
No, just Anderson. No front name.

1246
01:28:46,012 --> 01:28:47,475
No Mr., Mrs., or Miss.

1247
01:28:47,575 --> 01:28:48,630
Isn't that just dandy?

1248
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:52,792
- If we found out who took this place...
- I took this.

1249
01:28:52,892 --> 01:28:54,791
- You took what?
- I took this picture.

1250
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:57,515
I found it in Pedro's apartment.
I wanted to show it to you.

1251
01:28:57,615 --> 01:28:59,155
You see, he was our gardener.

1252
01:28:59,255 --> 01:29:01,753
These are the servants we had
down at father's place.

1253
01:29:01,853 --> 01:29:04,041
There's Pedro, and Rose...

1254
01:29:04,686 --> 01:29:07,991
- and there's Annie...
- Yes, darling, that's just fine.

1255
01:29:08,091 --> 01:29:10,433
I'm sure that Lt. Abrams
will be very grateful.

1256
01:29:10,533 --> 01:29:12,032
What do you think we ought to do?

1257
01:29:12,132 --> 01:29:14,271
Bring them all here.
Everyone mixed up in the case.

1258
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:17,164
- Let's see what we can get.
- You're on.

1259
01:29:18,006 --> 01:29:19,315
Going to take him tonight?

1260
01:29:19,415 --> 01:29:22,115
We're going to try.
Let's get something to eat. I'm thirsty.

1261
01:29:22,215 --> 01:29:23,393
How are you going to do it?

1262
01:29:23,493 --> 01:29:27,153
I don't know. I'm going to look, listen,
and pray that somebody makes a slip.

1263
01:29:27,253 --> 01:29:28,804
Just one slip.

1264
01:29:35,246 --> 01:29:37,521
- Did you get them all?
- They're coming.

1265
01:29:38,646 --> 01:29:39,870
- Selma.
- Take her upstairs.

1266
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:41,355
What is it? What does this mean?

1267
01:29:41,455 --> 01:29:43,482
Darling, don't worry.
Nick will fix everything.

1268
01:29:45,286 --> 01:29:47,271
I wish I were as sure as she is.

1269
01:29:47,371 --> 01:29:49,234
Figured out anything
about the setup here?

1270
01:29:49,334 --> 01:29:50,955
- A little.
- What's your plan?

1271
01:29:51,055 --> 01:29:52,632
Build up a case against each of them.

1272
01:29:52,732 --> 01:29:54,951
Throw everything we've got,
hard enough to bounce.

1273
01:29:55,051 --> 01:29:56,559
I'll make it bounce, all right.

1274
01:29:57,366 --> 01:29:59,271
- Wait a minute.
- It's all right, let him in.

1275
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:01,431
- Nick, have they found the gun?
- Not yet.

1276
01:30:01,531 --> 01:30:02,670
- Selma's upstairs.
- She is?

1277
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:05,803
- No talking, now.
- It's all right, I'll go up with him.

1278
01:30:17,446 --> 01:30:19,357
- David.
- Now, none of that.

1279
01:30:19,526 --> 01:30:20,845
No, no siree.

1280
01:30:21,126 --> 01:30:23,393
What about a few more chairs.
I'll keep my eye on them.

1281
01:30:23,493 --> 01:30:25,158
Sure, Mr. Charles.

1282
01:30:27,446 --> 01:30:28,674
Busybody.

1283
01:30:28,806 --> 01:30:29,875
Thank you, Nick.

1284
01:30:30,366 --> 01:30:33,324
This is outrageous,
bringing us to a place like this.

1285
01:30:43,766 --> 01:30:46,832
Break. That's fine.

1286
01:30:46,932 --> 01:30:49,310
- They're all here, Miss Forrest just came.
- Good.

1287
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,912
You didn't ask Aunt Katherine?

1288
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:54,630
I thought we'd return her hospitality.
We owe her something after last night.

1289
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,711
I'm going to get myself a box seat.

1290
01:30:56,811 --> 01:30:59,313
Now don't get so fresh!
Take your hands off me!

1291
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:01,593
All right, I just wanted to see
if you had a gun.

1292
01:31:01,693 --> 01:31:03,358
That's a new name for it.

1293
01:31:03,606 --> 01:31:06,672
Just wait until you boys ask me
to do another benefit for you.

1294
01:31:06,772 --> 01:31:08,165
All right, inside.

1295
01:31:09,806 --> 01:31:11,552
Say, is that Mrs. Landis?

1296
01:31:11,652 --> 01:31:13,152
Yes, would you like to meet her?

1297
01:31:13,252 --> 01:31:15,885
No, thanks, I've had enough of that family.

1298
01:31:16,006 --> 01:31:17,150
How are you, Lum?

1299
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:19,071
I got restaurant to run, no time for this.

1300
01:31:19,171 --> 01:31:22,035
If you're worried about the place,
I'll have it closed up for you.

1301
01:31:22,135 --> 01:31:23,153
Dancer...

1302
01:31:23,253 --> 01:31:25,710
we almost ran into each other
earlier this evening.

1303
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:28,115
That so? Too bad I missed you.

1304
01:31:28,246 --> 01:31:30,965
Then it was you. Thanks, I wasn't sure.

1305
01:31:42,446 --> 01:31:45,006
- Where's Casper?
- His phone's out of order.

1306
01:31:45,126 --> 01:31:47,154
Why don't you send a messenger?
What's wrong?

1307
01:31:47,254 --> 01:31:48,795
Shut up you. Cut out the chatter.

1308
01:31:48,895 --> 01:31:53,314
Well, Nicholas. I might have known
that you were at the bottom of this.

1309
01:31:53,414 --> 01:31:54,752
Come right in, Aunt Katherine.

1310
01:31:54,852 --> 01:31:57,230
How much more of this nonsense
have I got to endure?

1311
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:58,550
We hope this'll be the last.

1312
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:00,195
Aunt Katherine, sit over here.

1313
01:32:00,295 --> 01:32:02,793
Yes. This must be Dr. Kammer.

1314
01:32:02,893 --> 01:32:05,595
I've heard so much about you, from David.
Won't you come in?

1315
01:32:05,695 --> 01:32:07,722
Sit down, just find a chair.

1316
01:32:09,846 --> 01:32:11,751
I asked you all down here because...

1317
01:32:11,851 --> 01:32:14,512
we found another murder
had been committed here.

1318
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:17,954
He's a man I think you all know.
Pedro Dominguez.

1319
01:32:18,054 --> 01:32:19,153
Pedro, killed?

1320
01:32:19,253 --> 01:32:21,593
- Yeah, don't you read the papers?
- I was in the jug.

1321
01:32:21,693 --> 01:32:23,235
- What do you know about him?
- Nothing.

1322
01:32:23,335 --> 01:32:25,630
I only saw him a few times
when I went to pay my rent.

1323
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:28,675
What about you? You're in and out of here,
you must've known him.

1324
01:32:28,775 --> 01:32:30,802
Sure, I know him. So what?

1325
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:32,075
And you?

1326
01:32:32,406 --> 01:32:34,476
I never been in this house before.

1327
01:32:34,726 --> 01:32:35,726
You?

1328
01:32:35,853 --> 01:32:38,991
I had nothing to do with it.
I'm here to attend Mrs. Landis.

1329
01:32:39,091 --> 01:32:41,353
You're here to answer questions.
Did you know him?

1330
01:32:41,453 --> 01:32:42,453
No.

1331
01:32:43,086 --> 01:32:45,752
- You knew him, Mrs. Landis?
- I knew him?

1332
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:49,361
Yes, you remember him, Selma.
He used to be our gardener at Ross.

1333
01:32:49,726 --> 01:32:51,355
David, you remember him?

1334
01:32:51,455 --> 01:32:53,394
Was he the man with the long,
white mustache?

1335
01:32:53,494 --> 01:32:55,391
- Yes, what did you know about him?
- Nothing.

1336
01:32:55,491 --> 01:32:57,631
That was six years ago.
I haven't seen him since.

1337
01:32:57,731 --> 01:32:58,870
What about you?

1338
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:02,515
I can't see what possible connection
this can have with us.

1339
01:33:03,246 --> 01:33:05,601
You don't? Well, I'll tell you.

1340
01:33:05,806 --> 01:33:09,003
Pedro and Robert Landis were both shot
with the same gun.

1341
01:33:09,206 --> 01:33:12,431
Some monkey business was going on here
that we want to find out about.

1342
01:33:12,531 --> 01:33:13,750
You tell her, Mr. Charles.

1343
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:15,245
Yes, with pleasure.

1344
01:33:16,286 --> 01:33:18,154
It seems that one week ago...

1345
01:33:18,254 --> 01:33:22,115
Pedro rented this apartment to someone
calling himself, or herself...

1346
01:33:22,215 --> 01:33:23,605
Anderson.

1347
01:33:24,046 --> 01:33:26,196
- Did you ever see this Anderson?
- No.

1348
01:33:26,446 --> 01:33:28,394
- Ever hear him up here above you?
- No.

1349
01:33:28,494 --> 01:33:29,965
I thought not.

1350
01:33:30,126 --> 01:33:32,313
He was rather clever and ingenious,
this Anderson.

1351
01:33:32,413 --> 01:33:34,956
Always wore gloves,
never left a fingerprint.

1352
01:33:35,056 --> 01:33:37,560
He intended, with the aid of this ladder...

1353
01:33:37,926 --> 01:33:41,839
to crawl down into your place some night
and polish Robert off with this.

1354
01:33:41,966 --> 01:33:45,356
Then he was going to climb back up here,
unscrew the ladder...

1355
01:33:45,646 --> 01:33:48,524
throw that out the window
on a dump heap down below.

1356
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:52,954
Then walk quietly out leaving you
holding the bag for Robert's murder.

1357
01:33:53,686 --> 01:33:56,193
Do you know anyone who thinks
enough of you to do that?

1358
01:33:56,293 --> 01:33:57,799
Why, no.

1359
01:33:58,286 --> 01:34:00,670
- You're Dancer's girl, aren't you?
- I work for him.

1360
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:02,475
That's not what he asked you.

1361
01:34:02,575 --> 01:34:04,551
Well, we got an understanding.

1362
01:34:04,651 --> 01:34:06,871
Did Dancer know you were going away
with Robert?

1363
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:08,171
Why...

1364
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:11,072
Go on, you told us before.

1365
01:34:11,172 --> 01:34:15,045
You promised you'd keep that a secret.
I'll never trust a cop again.

1366
01:34:15,246 --> 01:34:18,631
Now listen, if you've made a dicker
with the cops, okay.

1367
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:21,355
But that ladder stuff's a lot of malarkey.

1368
01:34:21,455 --> 01:34:24,911
No one did come down that ladder,
and Landis wasn't killed in her place.

1369
01:34:25,011 --> 01:34:27,353
The only reason he wasn't killed
in her place...

1370
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:29,437
was that Anderson was found out.

1371
01:34:30,006 --> 01:34:32,600
Pedro came in here yesterday
to lay a new rug.

1372
01:34:33,566 --> 01:34:37,073
He didn't like the looks of things,
so he changed the lock on the door.

1373
01:34:37,173 --> 01:34:40,397
When Anderson came in,
he found that he was locked out.

1374
01:34:41,006 --> 01:34:43,600
Then he heard Pedro
telephoning me downstairs.

1375
01:34:44,286 --> 01:34:45,958
- And he shot him.
- So what?

1376
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:49,031
So, who is Anderson?

1377
01:34:49,131 --> 01:34:50,233
I'll bite, who?

1378
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:53,079
- Polly, Phil had a key to your apartment.
- Yes.

1379
01:34:53,286 --> 01:34:54,872
- And so had Dancer.
- Yeah.

1380
01:34:54,972 --> 01:34:57,196
- What about Lum?
- No, of course not.

1381
01:34:57,806 --> 01:34:59,558
- Anybody else?
- Nobody.

1382
01:34:59,766 --> 01:35:02,752
What do you think I do,
go around stuffing them under doors?

1383
01:35:02,852 --> 01:35:05,991
He's trying to hang this murder on us
to protect his family.

1384
01:35:06,091 --> 01:35:10,238
If the janitor didn't think everything
was okay, why didn't he call the cops?

1385
01:35:10,406 --> 01:35:13,115
Why does he call you?
Because it's a family affair.

1386
01:35:13,215 --> 01:35:16,032
She knocked her husband off.
Everyone knows that.

1387
01:35:16,132 --> 01:35:17,951
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

1388
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:19,951
Then you got that lug
to throw away your gun.

1389
01:35:20,051 --> 01:35:21,871
- It isn't true.
- That's a lie.

1390
01:35:21,971 --> 01:35:23,922
- Now, Mrs. Landis.
- Mrs. Landis.

1391
01:35:24,326 --> 01:35:26,790
You knew your husband and Polly
were friends, didn't you?

1392
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:28,595
- No.
- But you knew there was a woman.

1393
01:35:28,695 --> 01:35:29,995
- Yes.
- You knew this Pedro?

1394
01:35:30,095 --> 01:35:32,513
Lieutenant, suppose we take up
this check business.

1395
01:35:32,613 --> 01:35:34,873
Wait a minute.
Who's doing this, you or me?

1396
01:35:34,973 --> 01:35:38,720
- It never has been my party.
- Maybe this guy is right. How do I know?

1397
01:35:39,206 --> 01:35:41,515
- Were you ever in this room before?
- No.

1398
01:35:43,246 --> 01:35:44,679
What about you?

1399
01:35:44,846 --> 01:35:45,953
Of course not.

1400
01:35:46,053 --> 01:35:48,191
- What do you think...
- I'll tell you what I think.

1401
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,111
She had this room and you knew about it.

1402
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:53,112
You knew she was going to kill
her husband. You had Dr. Kammer...

1403
01:35:53,212 --> 01:35:54,552
all ready for the nut alibi.

1404
01:35:54,652 --> 01:35:58,595
I attended Mrs. Landis just to make sure
she didn't do anything desperate.

1405
01:35:58,695 --> 01:36:01,405
Mrs. Landis' mind is not balanced.

1406
01:36:01,646 --> 01:36:02,920
That isn't true!

1407
01:36:03,046 --> 01:36:05,995
There's nothing wrong with her.
You're trying to drive her crazy.

1408
01:36:06,095 --> 01:36:08,475
There's another mental case right there.

1409
01:36:09,966 --> 01:36:12,196
Break it up, boys, break it up!

1410
01:36:13,366 --> 01:36:14,766
Nickie!

1411
01:36:15,486 --> 01:36:16,886
Nickie!

1412
01:36:17,966 --> 01:36:19,392
Hey, what's the idea?

1413
01:36:19,492 --> 01:36:20,919
This way, darling.

1414
01:36:23,886 --> 01:36:26,153
Darling, you have the nicest
relatives and friends.

1415
01:36:26,253 --> 01:36:28,034
- Mr. Charles!
- Yes?

1416
01:36:28,134 --> 01:36:29,951
Don't walk off and leave me
with this bunch.

1417
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:32,792
I wouldn't have said what I had
if I hadn't been a bit punchy.

1418
01:36:32,892 --> 01:36:34,515
This gang has got me nuts.

1419
01:36:34,615 --> 01:36:37,395
- Go on, Nickie, it's just getting good.
- Attagirl.

1420
01:36:37,495 --> 01:36:39,556
All right, darling.
Let me know when you've had enough.

1421
01:36:40,206 --> 01:36:41,798
Now take it easy.

1422
01:36:42,286 --> 01:36:45,517
Well, suppose we all
go about this thing quietly.

1423
01:36:47,126 --> 01:36:48,926
Dancer...

1424
01:36:50,286 --> 01:36:51,924
there you are.

1425
01:36:52,886 --> 01:36:55,393
You know, that check of Robert's
for $20,000 was a forgery.

1426
01:36:55,493 --> 01:36:57,913
- So, what's it to me?
- It was traced from another check.

1427
01:36:58,013 --> 01:37:00,236
I still say, so what's it to me?

1428
01:37:00,406 --> 01:37:03,523
Just a minute, Lieutenant.
We'll handle it differently.

1429
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:09,555
Selma, did you deposit that check for
$20,000 to his account a few days ago?

1430
01:37:09,655 --> 01:37:12,319
- No.
- Yes, you did, Selma.

1431
01:37:12,926 --> 01:37:14,678
I remember your telling me.

1432
01:37:14,926 --> 01:37:16,154
Did you, Selma?

1433
01:37:19,406 --> 01:37:22,284
Yes, I think perhaps I did. I must have.

1434
01:37:22,446 --> 01:37:26,432
You think Robert forged her signature
and you're trying to hush it up, aren't you?

1435
01:37:26,532 --> 01:37:28,517
- Aren't you?
- No.

1436
01:37:28,686 --> 01:37:31,070
For years you've paid
to hush up his scandals.

1437
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:33,391
Don't you see
that's just what they're counting on?

1438
01:37:33,491 --> 01:37:36,125
Selma, is that the vanity case
they sent you?

1439
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:38,166
Yes.

1440
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:40,876
And when you returned it,
you sent a note along with it.

1441
01:37:40,976 --> 01:37:41,976
Yes.

1442
01:37:44,206 --> 01:37:46,234
You took a signature of that note...

1443
01:37:46,334 --> 01:37:49,152
traced it on this check
and deposited it to Robert's account.

1444
01:37:49,252 --> 01:37:51,593
Then you forged Robert's signature
to the other checks...

1445
01:37:51,693 --> 01:37:53,794
and had Polly keep him busy
until you cashed them.

1446
01:37:53,894 --> 01:37:57,872
Then I suppose I knock him off and
stir up all this fuss before I get the dough.

1447
01:37:57,972 --> 01:38:00,473
What kind of a stumblebum does that
make me out to be?

1448
01:38:00,573 --> 01:38:02,913
You're the stumblebum
that left your fingerprints...

1449
01:38:03,013 --> 01:38:05,600
all over the room
when you killed Phil Byrnes.

1450
01:38:07,086 --> 01:38:09,520
- Phil's dead?
- Yes, strangled.

1451
01:38:09,646 --> 01:38:11,791
- I didn't do it.
- Why did you go to his place?

1452
01:38:11,891 --> 01:38:13,595
Because I thought he'd gummed my game.

1453
01:38:13,695 --> 01:38:16,273
I figured he'd tried to hold up Landis
and had to kill him.

1454
01:38:16,373 --> 01:38:18,591
I pushed him around a bit
just to learn him manners.

1455
01:38:18,691 --> 01:38:19,750
Phooey!

1456
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:22,672
When I left him he had a split lip
and couple of dents in him...

1457
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:25,200
but he was just as much alive as you are.

1458
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:26,675
If that means anything.

1459
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:30,034
Just a minute, Lieutenant. Polly,
who knew that Phil was your husband?

1460
01:38:30,134 --> 01:38:31,872
- What?
- You were married, weren't you?

1461
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:32,972
Yeah.

1462
01:38:33,286 --> 01:38:35,713
- So Phil was your husband?
- As if you didn't know.

1463
01:38:35,813 --> 01:38:37,435
I didn't know it until now.

1464
01:38:37,535 --> 01:38:39,005
I wish I had, baby.

1465
01:38:39,366 --> 01:38:41,511
Didn't you ever tell anyone
that you were married?

1466
01:38:41,611 --> 01:38:42,995
- No.
- Would Phil have told?

1467
01:38:43,095 --> 01:38:45,998
No. He knew if Dancer heard,
I'd lose my job.

1468
01:38:46,446 --> 01:38:49,794
- Did you and Phil ever talk about it?
- Yeah. One night last week.

1469
01:38:49,894 --> 01:38:53,196
But nobody could have heard.
We were alone, down in my room.

1470
01:39:04,446 --> 01:39:05,473
With these earphones...

1471
01:39:05,573 --> 01:39:08,116
Anderson could hear everything
that went on in your place.

1472
01:39:08,216 --> 01:39:10,083
- Everything?
- Everything.

1473
01:39:10,326 --> 01:39:12,078
Holy smoke!

1474
01:39:14,086 --> 01:39:16,752
He knew more about all of you
than you know yourselves.

1475
01:39:16,852 --> 01:39:18,831
Dancer, you went to Phil's room...

1476
01:39:18,931 --> 01:39:21,672
right after you pulled the switch
at the Lichee, didn't you?

1477
01:39:21,772 --> 01:39:23,953
- Yes.
- That was about 1:00.

1478
01:39:24,053 --> 01:39:27,074
- What time was Phil killed?
- About 4:00, near as we can figure.

1479
01:39:27,174 --> 01:39:30,194
At 4:30, Anderson threw
this note through my window.

1480
01:39:30,294 --> 01:39:33,634
He was beginning to make use of
the information he got while he was here.

1481
01:39:33,734 --> 01:39:35,796
Dancer, how do you spell married?

1482
01:39:36,406 --> 01:39:38,044
Get Casper on the phone.

1483
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:40,480
We'll pass that.

1484
01:39:40,646 --> 01:39:42,637
Polly, how do you spell married?

1485
01:39:43,246 --> 01:39:44,846
M-A-R...

1486
01:39:48,406 --> 01:39:52,206
M-A-double-R-Y-E-D.

1487
01:39:52,846 --> 01:39:54,120
Thank you.

1488
01:39:54,246 --> 01:39:55,875
When it comes to words like that...

1489
01:39:55,975 --> 01:39:58,835
- an illiterate person...
- What do you mean illiterate?

1490
01:39:58,935 --> 01:40:02,316
My father and mother were married
right here in the City Hall.

1491
01:40:04,646 --> 01:40:07,843
- Having a good time, Mrs. Charles?
- It couldn't be better.

1492
01:40:08,486 --> 01:40:10,954
This note is a poor attempt at illiteracy.

1493
01:40:11,406 --> 01:40:14,711
The easy words are spelled wrong,
and the tough ones are spelled right.

1494
01:40:14,811 --> 01:40:16,364
Like to see it, Lum?

1495
01:40:17,286 --> 01:40:21,245
That was meant just to get me down
to Phil's place, to find his body.

1496
01:40:21,606 --> 01:40:24,395
And your fingerprints, Dancer.
Somebody's framing you.

1497
01:40:24,495 --> 01:40:26,795
- You say you don't know this Pedro?
- No.

1498
01:40:26,926 --> 01:40:30,919
There's a picture of him over here.
Perhaps this will refresh your memory.

1499
01:40:33,286 --> 01:40:35,402
Were you in on this check business?

1500
01:40:35,606 --> 01:40:37,676
- I know nothing about it.
- You lie.

1501
01:40:38,126 --> 01:40:40,995
You were here with those earphones on
listening to everything.

1502
01:40:41,095 --> 01:40:43,550
You were sore because
they weren't cutting you in on it.

1503
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:46,110
You followed Landis that night
and tried to stick him up.

1504
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:49,004
But something went wrong,
and you had to kill him.

1505
01:40:49,206 --> 01:40:50,924
I do not kill Pedro.

1506
01:40:51,366 --> 01:40:53,880
I do not follow Mr. Landis.

1507
01:40:54,206 --> 01:40:55,559
Ask Dancer.

1508
01:40:55,846 --> 01:40:59,680
- I go with him to get air.
- So you're the one that's framing me?

1509
01:40:59,886 --> 01:41:03,234
You weren't with me.
You can't use me for an alibi. You dirty...

1510
01:41:03,334 --> 01:41:04,334
Wait!

1511
01:41:04,606 --> 01:41:06,642
Just a minute, please.

1512
01:41:09,526 --> 01:41:13,075
All this time I've been waiting
for someone to make a slip.

1513
01:41:14,606 --> 01:41:16,198
Someone has made it.

1514
01:41:16,446 --> 01:41:17,799
We've been wrong.

1515
01:41:18,766 --> 01:41:21,075
This wasn't a killing for money.

1516
01:41:21,566 --> 01:41:24,239
It was a murder of hatred, of revenge.

1517
01:41:25,926 --> 01:41:29,157
Polly, what did Phil go to the pen for?

1518
01:41:29,646 --> 01:41:31,318
- Blackmail.
- Blackmail.

1519
01:41:32,046 --> 01:41:34,596
Did you and Phil talk about that, too,
down below?

1520
01:41:34,696 --> 01:41:35,696
Yes.

1521
01:41:36,206 --> 01:41:37,480
Thank you.

1522
01:41:38,366 --> 01:41:42,272
David, when were you supposed to give
Robert the money to go away?

1523
01:41:42,372 --> 01:41:43,675
This morning.

1524
01:41:43,775 --> 01:41:44,994
- In cash?
- Yes.

1525
01:41:45,646 --> 01:41:48,312
When he decided to go last night,
you had to give him bonds?

1526
01:41:48,412 --> 01:41:49,630
Yes, that's right, Nick.

1527
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:52,595
But where did you expect to get cash
on New Year's Day?

1528
01:41:52,695 --> 01:41:54,836
A bank holiday?

1529
01:41:56,126 --> 01:41:58,686
- I forgot about that.
- No, you didn't, David.

1530
01:41:59,006 --> 01:42:01,390
You never intended to give
Robert that money.

1531
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:04,791
You didn't want him to go away,
you wanted to kill him.

1532
01:42:04,891 --> 01:42:07,675
You wanted to get even
because he took Selma away from you.

1533
01:42:07,775 --> 01:42:11,600
Nick, please. Nora, is he fooling?

1534
01:42:12,006 --> 01:42:13,155
Oh, no.

1535
01:42:13,526 --> 01:42:15,394
But you were fooling, David,
when you said...

1536
01:42:15,494 --> 01:42:17,875
that you hadn't seen Pedro in six years.

1537
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:20,550
You said that he had a long,
white mustache.

1538
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:24,275
Well, he has a long, white mustache now,
but look at that picture.

1539
01:42:25,006 --> 01:42:28,794
There he is six years ago, and his
mustache is neither long nor white.

1540
01:42:29,006 --> 01:42:32,072
You didn't notice him six years ago,
any more than I did.

1541
01:42:32,172 --> 01:42:35,522
You remember him as you saw him
last night when you shot him.

1542
01:42:35,886 --> 01:42:38,719
You killed him and then you killed Robert.

1543
01:42:38,886 --> 01:42:40,153
Phil saw you do that...

1544
01:42:40,253 --> 01:42:43,232
that's why he followed you,
that's why he was on your fire escape.

1545
01:42:43,332 --> 01:42:46,841
He was going to blackmail you,
so you killed him, too.

1546
01:42:47,326 --> 01:42:50,913
Then you threw that note in at my window
hoping to throw me off your trail.

1547
01:42:51,013 --> 01:42:54,282
David, don't let him say
those terrible things!

1548
01:42:54,526 --> 01:42:55,995
Tell him it isn't true.

1549
01:42:56,095 --> 01:42:57,475
Tell him it isn't true.

1550
01:42:57,575 --> 01:42:59,471
Ask him why he threw
your gun away, Selma.

1551
01:42:59,571 --> 01:43:01,035
He knew that it hadn't been fired.

1552
01:43:01,135 --> 01:43:03,271
You'd only have to show it
to prove your innocence.

1553
01:43:03,371 --> 01:43:04,835
Yet he threw it away. Ask him why.

1554
01:43:04,935 --> 01:43:06,395
David, say you didn't do it.

1555
01:43:06,495 --> 01:43:08,913
Wasn't it because you hated her
as much as you did Robert?

1556
01:43:09,013 --> 01:43:11,390
Wasn't it because you wanted
to get even with her, too?

1557
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:14,275
Because you wanted to see
her hang for Robert's murder?

1558
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:15,430
Oh, David.

1559
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:18,954
Tell her the truth now, David.
You don't have to pretend any more.

1560
01:43:19,054 --> 01:43:21,154
All right, it's true, every word of it.

1561
01:43:21,254 --> 01:43:24,514
I've hated her, hated them both ever
since she threw me over for Robert.

1562
01:43:24,614 --> 01:43:27,432
I've been planning, waiting
and watching for the time to come...

1563
01:43:27,532 --> 01:43:30,438
when I could get even with them
for ruining my life.

1564
01:43:31,486 --> 01:43:35,274
I killed Robert, but not the way I wanted.
It was too quick, too easy!

1565
01:43:35,646 --> 01:43:38,558
I wanted to see him suffer
like he'd made me suffer.

1566
01:43:42,006 --> 01:43:43,678
I wanted to see you hang.

1567
01:43:44,206 --> 01:43:46,835
I wanted to see you
go gradually madder and madder...

1568
01:43:46,935 --> 01:43:49,715
until the day finally came
when you were going to hang!

1569
01:43:49,815 --> 01:43:52,559
Well, I made a mess out of everything,
all right!

1570
01:43:54,606 --> 01:43:57,484
I don't want a single move
out of any one of you.

1571
01:44:01,486 --> 01:44:05,479
All right, Selma, I may not see you hang...

1572
01:44:06,766 --> 01:44:08,112
but I'm gonna see you die.

1573
01:44:08,212 --> 01:44:09,473
Don't be a fool, David.

1574
01:44:09,573 --> 01:44:10,992
Get out of the way, Nora.

1575
01:44:11,092 --> 01:44:13,042
Nora, let me go. He will.

1576
01:44:13,206 --> 01:44:16,192
No jury will hold you responsible.
Dr. Kammer was right.

1577
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:20,245
I got six bullets in this gun.
One for her, one for myself...

1578
01:44:20,926 --> 01:44:23,353
Yeah, one for myself.

1579
01:44:23,453 --> 01:44:26,352
And the rest of them
for anybody that tries to stop me.

1580
01:44:26,452 --> 01:44:27,879
Get out of the way!

1581
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:30,245
Give me that gun!

1582
01:44:30,446 --> 01:44:33,722
- Nickie!
- Get him out.

1583
01:44:35,606 --> 01:44:37,562
I'll kill her!

1584
01:44:39,726 --> 01:44:42,286
Good heavens, I was right.
The man is crazy.

1585
01:44:42,446 --> 01:44:44,351
I can't believe it! David!

1586
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:46,713
Well, you certainly can pick them.

1587
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:49,073
- Nice work, Abrams, nice work.
- Yeah? Come on, Dancer.

1588
01:44:49,173 --> 01:44:50,230
What for?

1589
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:51,912
For about 10 years, for forgery.

1590
01:44:52,012 --> 01:44:54,353
Not counting that potshot
you took at Mr. Charles.

1591
01:44:54,453 --> 01:44:56,873
- Come on, get out of here.
- You, too, sister.

1592
01:44:56,973 --> 01:44:59,553
- This wasn't my idea...
- You were in with him, weren't you?

1593
01:44:59,653 --> 01:45:01,871
- Yes, but...
- You're going to be in with him again.

1594
01:45:01,971 --> 01:45:04,321
Nickie, are you sure you're all right?

1595
01:45:04,686 --> 01:45:06,802
I'm afraid so. Nice work, Lum.

1596
01:45:07,406 --> 01:45:09,237
And you sent his brother up.

1597
01:45:09,366 --> 01:45:12,722
Sure, Mr. Charles sent him up.
Number one detective!

1598
01:45:13,326 --> 01:45:16,284
I no like my brother. I like his girl.

1599
01:45:16,726 --> 01:45:19,001
I'm your friend, you bet you!

1600
01:45:23,286 --> 01:45:25,793
Here's to a very pleasant trip abroad.

1601
01:45:25,893 --> 01:45:28,639
- Thanks.
- London, Paris, Vienna, and points east.

1602
01:45:29,966 --> 01:45:33,271
Splendid, Dudley, splendid.
You're getting better every trip.

1603
01:45:33,371 --> 01:45:35,271
The telegraph boy at
the last station said...

1604
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:37,394
there's a lot of telegrams
for Mr. Nick Charles.

1605
01:45:37,494 --> 01:45:39,115
Who's Nick Charles? I never heard of him.

1606
01:45:39,215 --> 01:45:41,640
- That's what I said.
- Fine!

1607
01:45:42,126 --> 01:45:44,242
- Your room is ready, Ma'am.
- Thanks.

1608
01:45:44,486 --> 01:45:46,274
Well, good night, dear.

1609
01:45:46,374 --> 01:45:49,358
- Good night, sweet. Sleep well.
- Don't worry, I shall.

1610
01:45:50,486 --> 01:45:51,710
Good night, Nick.

1611
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:53,876
And thanks so much for everything.

1612
01:45:54,126 --> 01:45:55,764
I want to kiss you. May I?

1613
01:45:56,086 --> 01:45:59,556
Go right ahead. But I warn you,
it's a hard habit to get out of.

1614
01:46:01,926 --> 01:46:03,518
Good night, Selma.

1615
01:46:10,486 --> 01:46:11,486
Nora.

1616
01:46:12,086 --> 01:46:13,963
What's the matter, Nick?

1617
01:46:14,446 --> 01:46:15,879
It isn't true.

1618
01:46:16,086 --> 01:46:17,644
What isn't true?

1619
01:46:18,766 --> 01:46:20,643
- Pinch me.
- Why?

1620
01:46:21,006 --> 01:46:22,806
Pinch me.

1621
01:46:24,686 --> 01:46:26,483
- It is true.
- What?

1622
01:46:26,766 --> 01:46:30,194
We're alone. No family, no friends...

1623
01:46:30,294 --> 01:46:32,595
no reporters, no police, no nothing.

1624
01:46:32,846 --> 01:46:33,846
Good.

1625
01:46:34,606 --> 01:46:36,990
I suppose we ought to decide
where we're going.

1626
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:38,644
- Why? Do you care?
- No.

1627
01:46:39,286 --> 01:46:41,473
- But I haven't any clothes.
- What's the difference?

1628
01:46:41,573 --> 01:46:43,152
Saves you the trouble of packing.

1629
01:46:43,252 --> 01:46:47,683
And I don't need anything in the world,
darling, but you and a toothbrush.

1630
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,124
What's that?

1631
01:46:56,646 --> 01:46:58,318
Looks like a baby's sock.

1632
01:47:12,486 --> 01:47:14,556
And you call yourself a detective.

1633
01:47:15,806 --> 01:47:18,004
Why, Mrs. Charles.

1634
01:47:19,305 --> 01:48:19,467
