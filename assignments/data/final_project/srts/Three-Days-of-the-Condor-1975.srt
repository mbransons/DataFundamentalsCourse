1
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:25,093


2
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:40,557
Howdy.

3
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,561
- You lost?
- No.

4
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,485
Don't see folks
out this way much.

5
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:51,650
That's a lot
of dead prairie dogs.

6
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,694
It's just target practice.

7
00:01:56,935 --> 00:02:00,457
You know, my grandfather
used to say,

8
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,938
"If you kill all
the prairie dogs,

9
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,942
there'd be no one left
to cry for the rain."

10
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:06,022
Prairie dogs don't
make it rain.

11
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:07,744
It's because they burrow,

12
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:09,386
and then that turns the earth.

13
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:11,308
They keep it from
getting too hard-packed.

14
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,909
And that way,
when it rains,

15
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,913
the water can get in
and make things grow.

16
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:19,596
Did I say something funny?

17
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,678
It's always funny
to listen to the white man

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,682
explain how the world works.

19
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:27,404
Still, hard to imagine

20
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:30,287
coming all this way
to see prairie dogs.

21
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,291
What can I say?
I dislike prairie dogs.

22
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:37,096
Can't find something you
dislike closer to home?

23
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,701
Y'all army or something?

24
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,983
Heard they was lettin'
was lettin' girls in.

25
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:48,387
Didn't realize they was letting
in little, pretty ones.

26
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,355
What...

27
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,359
I was handling it.

28
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:10,650
Psycho.

29
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:29,128
<i>Target is
at seven o'clock.</i>

30
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,290
The brunette.

31
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,411
I need confirmation.

32
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:34,573
No, no, Sam.
You're a fucking idiot.

33
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:37,056
Joe, the fate of humanity
rests on the line.

34
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:38,457
Oh, the fate of humanity?

35
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,139
The fate of your sperm anyway.

36
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:41,861
Dude, why don't you go
and pick her up?

37
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:43,462
Because he knows I'd
cut his balls off.

38
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:45,464
She would, she'll cut off my
balls, and I need my balls,

39
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,468
which is why I have to live
vicariously through your balls, Joe,

40
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,388
which frankly sucks.

41
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,711
Baby, tell Joe to hit
on the brunette, please.

42
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:54,513
- First, let's do some shots.
- Yes.

43
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:57,076
- How long ago did you break up with whatsherface?
- Who's "whatsherface?"

44
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:59,238
Can I get three shots
of tequila, please? Thank you.

45
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,801
- Janice.
- Janice, the girl you're still bent out of shape over.

46
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,923
That was six years ago. I'm not
bent out of shape over Janice.

47
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:06,085
If you don't date for six years
after your break-up with someone,

48
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:08,327
you're bent out of shape over
her whether you know it or not.

49
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,489
Hey, what are you doing
with my phone?

50
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,531
- I'm on Tinder.
- No, no, no, no, no.

51
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,533
Finding Joe a girl.

52
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:15,495
Why can't the three of us
just hang out, huh?

53
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:18,458
'Cause you're a third wheel, baby, and
we don't enjoy hanging out with you.

54
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,860
- What about Melanie?
- Give me my phone. I'm not kidding.

55
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,061
No, no. No, Mae.

56
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:23,303
Oh, no, never mind.

57
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:25,265
- You know what?
- Selfie with a baby tiger.

58
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:26,946
Even the kids
are worried about you, Joe.

59
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:29,349
Jude says to me the other night
when I put him to bed,

60
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:32,512
he looks up with me through his
sad little eyes, and he says,

61
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:35,315
"Daddy, I'm worried
that Uncle Joe is lonely."

62
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,357
You're such a shitter.
No, he didn't.

63
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,438
- No, he did.
- Liar.

64
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,480
He said it to me while
I was putting him to bed.

65
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:42,002
Yeah, right.

66
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:43,643
You haven't been home to put
the kids to bed in two years.

67
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:45,886
Hmm, thanks, Babe.

68
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,288
Just personalizing
the story for effect.

69
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,010
Being in a relationship
is like being in a cult.

70
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:52,933
When you're in one, you want every
one else to be in one with you.

71
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,775
Yeah, because it's
beautiful, Joe.

72
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:57,657
Okay, I'm gonna take
my sweet wife home.

73
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,579
I'm gonna make
tender love to her,

74
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:02,502
to my wife, to this woman
who I share a rich life with,

75
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,665
we share a family.

76
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:08,108
Show her my innermost secrets,
my hopes, my dreams.

77
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,671
You, on the other hand, you're gonna go
home in your shitty little apartment,

78
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:12,793
you're gonna eat cold pizza,
and jerk off into a pillow.

79
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:14,595
Dude, I don't have any pizza.

80
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,557
Okay, I just found your wife.

81
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,918
She's perfect for you.

82
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
- Let me see.
- And you're a match.

83
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,562
Let me see. Kathy H.?

84
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,566
- She's pretty.
- Let me see, let me see.

85
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,247
She's pretty.

86
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:27,488
Yeah.

87
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,130
Kathy H. is gonna
change your life.

88
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:31,372
Do you wanna have
a drink tomorrow?

89
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,813
No, no, no, no.
Don't send anything.

90
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:34,495
Did you send it?

91
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,537
Jesus. You sent it?

92
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,180
- To Kathy H.
- To Kathy H.

93
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,582
Geez. To Kathy H.

94
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,586
Yeah.

95
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:53,556
Shut up.

96
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:46,648
Hey, Sam.

97
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,929
<i>Hey, buddy,
pick up your pace.</i>

98
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,851
<i>You're not even running
an eight-minute mile.</i>

99
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:52,416
<i>Listen, I need you to come over
here and look at something for me.</i>

100
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:54,136
No can do.

101
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:56,098
Your wife hacked
my dating life, remember?

102
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,421
<i>Yeah, well, it's important.
I need your advice, Joe.</i>

103
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:02,825
Okay, sure. I can be at your place
in an hour. Everything cool?

104
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:04,586
<i>I actually need you
at the office.</i>

105
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,708
You want me
to come to your office?

106
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,433
<i>What I want is for you to take
those stairs up ahead on the left.</i>

107
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,315
Sam, are you tracking my phone?

108
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,319
Not a good time
to stop, Pal.

109
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,802
<i>Pick it up, Joe. Move.</i>

110
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:25,247
<i>Come on, buddy, two at a time.</i>

111
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:27,650
<i>Take a left to the top of the stairs.</i>

112
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:29,654
What's going on, Sam?

113
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:34,056
<i>Get in that van that's
right in front of you.</i>

114
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:36,060
What van?

115
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:39,744
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

116
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,879
Who are we gonna see?

117
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:59,082
Your Uncle Bob
and the Deputy Director.

118
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:00,363
Of the CIA?

119
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,764
- Of the CIA.
- Yeah?

120
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,527
Two years ago, you wrote a
program with Harold Floros

121
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:06,729
to help screen employees
at likely terrorist targets

122
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:08,611
in the Middle East and Europe
to assess the threat potential.

123
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,013
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,694
You know, I didn't think anyone
ever looked at that thing.

125
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:12,776
The program is operational?

126
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:14,738
It's operational, Joe,
and it works.

127
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,580
And you have a chance
to save a lot of lives today.

128
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:19,584
We flagged this guy,
Ammar Nazari.

129
00:09:26,752 --> 00:09:28,754
<i>Nazari is
a Saudi national.</i>

130
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,437
<i>Thirty-two years old.</i>

131
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,119
<i>Before your program
found this guy,</i>

132
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,762
<i>we'd never heard of him.</i>

133
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:41,367
<i>He's a fresh face
in the Sunni terror community.</i>

134
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,170
Here we go.

135
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:49,174
Welcome to the big
leagues, Joe.

136
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,180
Let me show you something.

137
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,662
There it is.

138
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,145
This is everything
we've got on Nazari.

139
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,227
Now, we've been watching him
for the past six weeks.

140
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:06,110
He's clean, until noon today
when he goes to a PO box

141
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:08,232
that no one knew he had,
and picks up a package.

142
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,473
What's in the package?

143
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,517
That's the problem, Joe.
We have no fucking idea.

144
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,921
Yeah. We didn't have
time to do a sweep.

145
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:19,884
Sam, is that ComQuest Field?

146
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,206
Mmm-hmm. That's where Nazari's been working
as a janitor for the past six weeks

147
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,768
until your program flagged him.

148
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,770
The program I designed was
supposed to screen employees

149
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,772
with high profile targets
in the Middle East and Europe.

150
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:29,894
Joe.

151
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,776
Your uncle has been running
with this all by himself.

152
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:33,858
- Bob is running this?
- We had no idea.

153
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,180
If you have an issue with it, you take it up
with him, but you do it on your own time.

154
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:38,222
Nazari, right now,
is on his way

155
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:41,225
to a stadium filled
with people as we speak.

156
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,347
So, you have a state trooper
pull him over.

157
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:44,469
You search the car.

158
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:46,391
What if he detonates it?

159
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:48,513
- Detonates what?
- Exactly.

160
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,994
What is it?

161
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,996
Is it nuclear, biological, chemical?
We don't know what,

162
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,078
Why are we gonna give this guy
a chance to pull the trigger?

163
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,840
Okay.

164
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:57,402
Wait.

165
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:00,245
You're gonna kill him, aren't you?
That's what this is.

166
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:01,846
That's what this
room is, right?

167
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:03,608
That's why you're here.

168
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,690
Yeah, we wanna hear
every perspective...

169
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:08,253
- This is fucking crazy.
- ...before we act on it.

170
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,377
Subject is just over
one mile from the target.

171
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,738
Is it a target, Mr. Turner?

172
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,902
Joe, this is Mr. Abbott,
Deputy Director of the CIA.

173
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,025
Well, is it?

174
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,107
Uh...

175
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:25,871
The algorithm only looks at employees
of high profile targets, Mr. Abbott.

176
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:29,114
So the question isn't so much
if ComQuest Field is a target,

177
00:11:29,116 --> 00:11:31,396
but more if Ammar Nazari
is a threat.

178
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:35,280
Your algorithm gave Mr. Nazari
a 12% threat probability.

179
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:38,323
Yes, but the algorithm wasn't
designed to be used in this country,

180
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,565
so there are variables
that will need to be adjusted

181
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,527
to make the program actionable.

182
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,130
The subject is
getting off I-495.

183
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:48,934
A Saudi-born American citizen
who is also a Muslim,

184
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:51,296
just visited a secret
safety deposit box,

185
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,661
and is on his way now
to a football stadium.

186
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:56,744
How many variables do we need?

187
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:00,466
But with all due respect,
uh, Mr. Abbott,

188
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:03,228
Muslim-Americans are allowed
to have PO boxes

189
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,233
and also work
in football stadiums.

190
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:08,516
- Sir?
- Excuse me.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,683
What would you do
if this was your play?

192
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:20,566
I don't know.
How could I...

193
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:23,449
We don't have enough
time to not know.

194
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,453
Subject is pulling in
to the stadium parking lot.

195
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,534
<i>Subject is parking.</i>

196
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:32,458
Shadow 1 Bravo engaging. Over.

197
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,301
You're talking about killing a man
without any evidence against him,

198
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:38,024
except for an algorithm
that I wrote years ago

199
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,747
and subsequently forgot about.

200
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:43,990
Now forgive me for taking a second
to contemplate the 88% likelihood

201
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:46,673
that this man is guilty of nothing more
than coming from the wrong country

202
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:47,794
and applying for
the wrong fucking job.

203
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:49,676
You wrote the program, Joe.

204
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:52,398
Yeah, I did, so you guys
would know who to look at,

205
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,401
but not through the scope
of a fucking sniper rifle.

206
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,524
Enough dithering
with your nephew, Bob.

207
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,045
Let's get on with this.

208
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:02,208
He's the reason we're here.
His program found this man.

209
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,332
A man we suspect of being a terrorist
is about to walk a package,

210
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,173
<i>whose contents
are unknown to us,</i>

211
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:11,378
<i>into a football stadium packed
with 80,000 American souls.</i>

212
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,382
Subject's car door
is open.

213
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:20,227
Thank you for your valuable
service, Mr. Turner.

214
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:21,948
We should have more
young men like you.

215
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,870
We'll take it from here.
Thank you.

216
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:25,592
- Joe.
- Okay.

217
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:28,315
Let's go, Joe.

218
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,759
Sir, team leader wants to
know if we have a green light.

219
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:21,489
<i>You know, the head coach and his offense coordinator...</i>

220
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,091
<i>You've reached Sam Barber.
Please leave a message.</i>

221
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:26,294
Sam, it's me.

222
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:28,616
What the fuck was that?

223
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,858
I mean, are those
people safe or not?

224
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,621
I'm just standing here, watching the
fucking TV. Can you call me, please?

225
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:36,424
Bye.

226
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,587
<i>And that part's been top-down.</i>

227
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,390
<i>Which is why we saw a change
coming into this season.</i>

228
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:45,874
<i>But you can't change the culture
of a football team overnight.</i>

229
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,435
<i>These things take time.</i>

230
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:49,477
<i>And right now,</i>

231
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,399
<i>you're looking at a group of young men
who are physically outmatching...</i>

232
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:52,881
Oh, shit.

233
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,885
<i>That takes a toll.</i>

234
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,165
<i>Big challenge for
the new coaching regime,</i>

235
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,169
<i>trying to ride this ship.</i>

236
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,812
<i>All right now,
first down in mid-field.</i>

237
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:17,866
So, after the diagnosis, my aunt
started seeing this energy healer.

238
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:21,109
So, one day, I went with her,
and he shook my hand,

239
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,752
and said, "You have the gift.

240
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,153
You're a healer.

241
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:28,156
That's what you're meant
to do with your life."

242
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:32,561
He said that he could teach me how to
harness the power of my gift, and...

243
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:35,204
You know, use it
in a positive way.

244
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:38,169
So, uh, that's what you do?
You're a... A healer?

245
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,730
I'm a lawyer.

246
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,132
Uh-huh.

247
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:48,259
That's usually the part of the
story where people laugh.

248
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:54,904
You... Big football fan?

249
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,185
- Uh, no.
- Degenerate gambler?

250
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,307
- No, I have...
- 'Cause this is a new one for me.

251
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:00,950
Losing a guy's interest
to football in the first date.

252
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:02,954
I hate football. I couldn't
even tell you who's winning.

253
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,315
- Is that supposed to make me feel better?
- Yeah.

254
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:08,517
No, uh...

255
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,079
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

256
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,201
Uh...

257
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:14,205
What kind of law
do you practice?

258
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:19,208
- Intellectual property.
- Okay.

259
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,172
I have some semi-conductor
clients here in the US

260
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:25,375
whose US patents
are being knocked off

261
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:27,659
in, uh, China and Korea
and...

262
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,025
I'd rather not drink alone.

263
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,911
God.

264
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:47,197
Wait.

265
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,239
Wait, wait.

266
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,201
Look, I'm sorry.

267
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,203
I'm just glad something you're
interested in wasn't on.

268
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:54,564
I really am sorry.

269
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,568
Today...
Today was a bad...

270
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,491
It was a weird fucking day.

271
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,612
And the truth is,

272
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:04,616
I meant to cancel our date,
but I forgot.

273
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,459
Well, why didn't you
just start with that?

274
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,621
Yeah.

275
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:13,906
Yeah, in hindsight,
that was the obvious move.

276
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,309
Look, it's already late,

277
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,313
but I just live
a few blocks from here.

278
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,477
I mean if you wanna
walk me home.

279
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,481
Yeah.

280
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,163
All right.

281
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:35,408
Why was today a bad day?

282
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:38,611
Something happened. Work.

283
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:40,451
What?

284
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:43,175
I, uh... I can't really...
I can't really talk about it.

285
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:46,056
Yeah.

286
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:48,301
Everyone I know has
to sign NDAs now.

287
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:50,983
Yeah.

288
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,307
Wait, so what do you do?

289
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:59,032
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

290
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,315
'Cause I'm gonna quit tomorrow.

291
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,920
Do you go on
a lot of these?

292
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,040
Dates?

293
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,164
Uh, I text people.

294
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:16,447
And I fantasize they'd
be amazing.

295
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:20,251
Basically have an entire
imaginary relationship

296
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,774
that ends in a breakup before
they can even text you back.

297
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,335
You got it.

298
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,218
- I guess I'm not...
- As unique as you thought you were.

299
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:31,264
Me, neither.

300
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:37,471
How are you single?

301
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:39,913
That was a line.

302
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:46,718
Takes too long really
get to know someone.

303
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,003
- Mmm-hmm.
- That person is never as good as the one you imagined.

304
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,368
Sometimes you get hurt.

305
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,129
You know...

306
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:59,251
If we were a rational culture,

307
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:01,573
we would begin
every first date by saying,

308
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,135
"Here's what's wrong with me."

309
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:04,776
- Let's just get it out of the way, huh?
- Yup.

310
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,138
This is me.

311
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,142
Okay.

312
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:11,103
So fine...

313
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:12,824
- Tell me.
- What?

314
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,306
What's wrong with you?

315
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,390
Come on.

316
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:20,272
What? I'm a stranger.

317
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:22,276
You're never gonna
see me again.

318
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:25,197
You're not gonna see me again?

319
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:27,201
You think I'd go
on a second date with you?

320
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,201
Come on.

321
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,083
I know this cozy
little sports bar.

322
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,085
It's a few blocks from here.
You'd love it.

323
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,289
Okay.

324
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,293
Okay?

325
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:41,814
Okay.

326
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:43,818
All right.

327
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:02,395
Hello.

328
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:05,118
I imagine you must
be pissed at me.

329
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,122
<i>You don't have
to imagine too hard.</i>

330
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,845
I can't be part of a program
whose mission I...

331
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,369
No longer believe in.

332
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,971
You're not the only one
who believes that spying

333
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:21,975
on American citizens
is wrong, Joe.

334
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:24,617
Yeah, but I am the only one
whose belief that it's wrong

335
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,419
stops him from doing it.

336
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:28,701
Sometimes, you have
to do the wrong thing.

337
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:32,786
<i>Why is that?</i>

338
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:35,428
So you don't have to do
the worse thing later.

339
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,991
See, you keep moving
the line, Bob.

340
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:40,233
That's your problem.

341
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:42,237
Or maybe it's your talent.
I don't know.

342
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,360
But I...
I can't do this anymore.

343
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,043
I out.

344
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:51,004
Sometimes a man's conflicted

345
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:55,208
only because it's in his nature
to be conflicted,

346
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,053
which is what makes him
so damn good at what he does.

347
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,376
It's the people
who don't have that

348
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:06,460
dissenting a voice inside them
that are truly dangerous.

349
00:21:06,462 --> 00:21:08,942
<i>That dissenting
voice doesn't mean much</i>

350
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:12,586
if the dangerous people you work
for aren't willing to hear it.

351
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:14,590
We're in a crowded theater.

352
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:17,313
It's on fire.

353
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,236
All we can do is yell
as loud as we can.

354
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:23,437
I'm sorry, Bob.

355
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,639
<i>You did a good thing, Joe.</i>

356
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:27,401
<i>Yeah, I don't know
what that means,</i>

357
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:28,642
<i>and I don't wanna know.</i>

358
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:31,285
Turn on the TV. We'll
talk about it tomorrow.

359
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,967
I'm out, I mean it.

360
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:34,971
Any channel.

361
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:43,299
Did I wake you, sweetheart?

362
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:56,711
<i>The airborne or pneumonic type of the
plague virus that was found on Nazari,</i>

363
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:59,914
<i>is the rarest and deadliest
form of the disease.</i>

364
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:04,639
<i>With a mortality rate of close
to 100% if left untreated.</i>

365
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:08,483
<i>Had Nazari been allowed to release
this bio-weapon undetected,</i>

366
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:14,088
<i>those 80,000 people might now be
back in their homes or offices</i>

367
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,491
<i>unwittingly infecting
thousands.</i>

368
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:18,495
<i>The FBI is calling
this an act of terrorism.</i>

369
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:39,114
I mean the guy IPO'd at 24
and retired at 28.

370
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:41,236
Now he just sails around
on his boat, you know,

371
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:43,478
following the warm weather
like some kind of bird.

372
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,560
- Turner, Joseph. 8:22
- Oh, God.

373
00:22:45,562 --> 00:22:48,483
Ellie, leave Harold alone.
He has work to do.

374
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:50,245
It's still
early right now.

375
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:52,407
The resolve
is melting, Joe.

376
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:54,932
Faster or slower the polar ice caps?

377
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:58,534
Good morning, Colonel.

378
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:00,415
See, I'm playing
a long game here, Joe.

379
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:03,579
I'm gonna win to the Christmas
party, and then I make my big move.

380
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,701
What happens
at the Christmas party?

381
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,543
I break out my secret weapon.

382
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:10,508
Colonel, do you see a, uh, secret
weapon anywhere on Harold?

383
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:13,551
No?

384
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,512
You need a calling card,
something to distinguish you.

385
00:23:16,514 --> 00:23:18,714
I don't need a calling card.
What I'm saying is this is my home.

386
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:19,955
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, listen.

387
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,557
I'm a fantastic dancer, okay?

388
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,560
Women respond to this
on a primal level.

389
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:26,762
Do you get that? I mean,
they can't help themselves.

390
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:30,166
I lived with the Makalanga
for a year, all right?

391
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:31,527
They taught me how to dance.

392
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:34,050
Surely you want Ellie
to like you for your mind.

393
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:36,292
- Listen, attraction is instinctual.
- There you are.

394
00:23:36,294 --> 00:23:38,574
In our base programming,
we're still primates.

395
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:41,577
And the big monkey gets
all the hugs. Great.

396
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:44,943
Only 'cause his algorithms saved a few
hundred thousand lives last night.

397
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:50,026
What's that now?
Comquest Field... That was...

398
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,587
Thanks for telling me. That's...

399
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,589
Our algorithm was used last night
to stop a terrorist attack.

400
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:55,111
Mmm-hmm.

401
00:23:55,113 --> 00:23:57,073
Nice to know.

402
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:59,515
Probably saved all
of DC last night.

403
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:01,237
No big deal.
Right back to work.

404
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,599
Yup.

405
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,603
Not even so much
as a celebratory cigarette?

406
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,446
You're right.

407
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:12,128
I can't believe I have to go to
dinner with my folks tonight

408
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,652
and listen to my father bitch about
how he should have become a doctor.

409
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,096
Clark Kent will always be a
coward to his friends and family.

410
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,857
Not true.

411
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,099
Ma and Pa Kent
know he's Superman.

412
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:25,103
Ah, yeah.

413
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:30,827
Look, I know you won't get
any credit,

414
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,830
and you won't give
yourself any,

415
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:36,032
but you did some good, Joe.

416
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,834
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

417
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:39,838
You know, honestly,

418
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,641
until I saw
the news last night,

419
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,801
I was gonna quit.

420
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:46,805
- Shut up.
- No, I even told Bob.

421
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:52,529
You honestly wanna quit because a
terrorist's civil liberties are violated?

422
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:54,171
Not to mention
the civil liberties

423
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:56,814
of a whole lot of other people who
it turned out weren't terrorists.

424
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:59,656
Yeah, we collected data on
a bunch of innocent people

425
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,538
who are now safer for it.

426
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,141
- How's that bad?
- Okay, but what about the ones we watched?

427
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:06,103
Interviewed?

428
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,185
Held for a few hours?

429
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:10,387
Where's the line?

430
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:14,872
Eighty thousand people get infected
with the plague at a football game.

431
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:18,476
They don't show any signs
of being sick for days.

432
00:25:18,478 --> 00:25:20,638
They go home.

433
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,600
They go to work.

434
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:25,082
And some get on airplanes,
and they go to other countries.

435
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,564
A couple of minutes ago,
it was just DC.

436
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,285
Now we save the world?

437
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:30,290
Come on.

438
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:33,731
What's he doing here?

439
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:36,654
What? I can't hear you.
It's thick glass.

440
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:39,499
Probably came to accept
your resignation in person.

441
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,702
Yesterday, countless
American lives were saved

442
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,744
because of this group.

443
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,748
And you deserve
congratulations.

444
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,112
But...

445
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,594
That's not what I'm here for.

446
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:02,801
Ammar Nazari got a job at
ComQuest Field with a plan

447
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:07,527
to infect Americans with the
plague during a football game.

448
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:11,171
We know very little else
about him.

449
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:17,297
Until six weeks ago,
he'd never been on our radar.

450
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:20,100
We don't know...

451
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,020
<i>Who trained him,</i>

452
00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:24,024
<i>who he's working for.</i>

453
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,911
The device that was on him,

454
00:26:32,913 --> 00:26:36,557
would have required a great deal of
engineering skill and manufacturing.

455
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:42,361
<i>Which means Nazari was
most likely not working alone.</i>

456
00:26:42,363 --> 00:26:46,685
Someone out there could
still have weaponized plague,

457
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:49,770
and we have to assume
they're going to use it.

458
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:57,936
<i>JTTF is working on the
encryptions on Nazari's laptop,</i>

459
00:26:57,938 --> 00:27:02,061
<i>combing through his house,
interviewing his neighbors,</i>

460
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:06,025
trying to trace the materials
on the device

461
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:08,427
back to a manufacturer.

462
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:11,951
<i>But it wasn't the JTTF
who found this guy.</i>

463
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:16,035
<i>And I'm sure as hell not
gonna entrust this hunt</i>

464
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,678
<i>to conventional methods alone.</i>

465
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,081
<i>Now, I've rarely
ever given you anything</i>

466
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:25,326
other an open-ended
mandate to innovate.

467
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,610
But today, I'm asking you...

468
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,575
To put whatever
you're doing on hold,

469
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:39,859
and make this
your only priority.

470
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:43,785
<i>If the people Nazari was working
with are gearing for another attack,</i>

471
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:48,710
we may only have a small
window to find and stop them.

472
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:04,444
You sure this is safe,
Nathan?

473
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:05,765
A hundred percent.

474
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,846
I got kids.

475
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:08,928
As one father to another

476
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,972
I guarantee you, you have
nothing to worry about.

477
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:14,094
Our man will pick it up
at the embassy tomorrow.

478
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:16,098
- Okay.
- Safe flight, Ambassador.

479
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:26,709
So that's it.

480
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,672
Let's do it.

481
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:33,553
Bob, about last night...

482
00:28:33,555 --> 00:28:35,558
Let's talk about it later.

483
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,761
<i>Walk us
through a scenario</i>

484
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,883
<i>where a weaponized
pneumonic plague</i>

485
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:46,967
<i>gets that kind of traction
in a major American city.</i>

486
00:28:46,969 --> 00:28:49,890
<i>What kind of plans
does the CDC have in place?</i>

487
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:52,533
<i>Well, the plan
is mass prophylaxis.</i>

488
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:56,977
<i>So, the US has been stock piling
ciprofloxacin for decades.</i>

489
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:59,900
<i>So, in the event
of a health emergency,</i>

490
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:02,863
<i>PODs or Points
of Dispensing Sites</i>

491
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:05,106
<i>would be set up
in every major US city.</i>

492
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:13,194
Stock transactions?

493
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:17,038
Every stock transaction in the pharmaceutical
sector going back three years.

494
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,360
Uh-huh. Why?

495
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:22,363
Uh, well, I was thinking about the
country's vaccine stockpiles.

496
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:24,405
- Oh.
- Ciprofloxacin.

497
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:25,927
Bingo.

498
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:27,568
Girl I used to date
called this morning

499
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,811
to ask if my father could
write her a prescription.

500
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:32,413
You're wondering if someone
made a move into Big Pharma

501
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:35,817
knowing vaccine stockpiles
would be depleted?

502
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:38,620
Like the terrorists shorting
airline stocks before 9/11.

503
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:40,221
You see, that's a fiction.

504
00:29:40,223 --> 00:29:42,383
Yeah, well, Dick Tracy wore a
two-way wrist radio in the 40s,

505
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:43,985
and now people
wear Apple watches.

506
00:29:43,987 --> 00:29:45,066
Not cool people.

507
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:46,948
The point is,
fiction can become real.

508
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,030
- Dick Tracy?
- He was an underrated detective.

509
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:50,832
So which transactions
stand out?

510
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:52,594
Uh, well...

511
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:54,235
I found these 12 companies,

512
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:57,198
and collectively, they bought over
a billion worth of Big Pharma.

513
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,560
What connects them?

514
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:00,362
See, that's just it.
They're all different sizes,

515
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:01,763
they're headquartered in
different countries.

516
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:03,565
It all looks completely random,

517
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:06,368
but that is exactly how you want it
to look if you're the one doing it.

518
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,411
Okay, so what you're saying is what
you found is that you found nothing.

519
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:10,612
Uh, no.

520
00:30:10,614 --> 00:30:12,614
Humans don't do random well.

521
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:14,376
The minute we try to avoid
creating a pattern,

522
00:30:14,378 --> 00:30:16,058
we just create a different
kind of pattern.

523
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,779
So your big idea
is to follow

524
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:19,621
the money back to the dick
turds who planned this thing.

525
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:21,625
Dick turds?

526
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:24,346
Yeah.
It's pretty flimsy there, bud.

527
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:25,827
Yeah, you're reaching.

528
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,831
I know, I know.

529
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,641
<i>Now, the FBI is calling this
an act of terrorism,</i>

530
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:42,124
<i>but there's been no claim
of responsibility</i>

531
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:45,127
<i>from any known
terror organization.</i>

532
00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:47,531
<i>Is there any indication that a...</i>

533
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,402
Coming through.

534
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:22,925
<i>Hello.</i>

535
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:25,168
<i>I have a new
assignment for you.</i>

536
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,172
<i>I need it expedited.</i>

537
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:30,533
<i>The target package
has been sent.</i>

538
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:32,537
I'm looking at it now.

539
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,728
I'm gonna drop you
on your head.

540
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,732
Come here.

541
00:32:07,212 --> 00:32:09,172
So how'd it go
with Kathy H?

542
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:11,176
Yeah, it was good. Maybe.
I don't know.

543
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:14,057
Thank you.

544
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,179
You're so good with him.

545
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:18,264
You'd be such a great dad if you
could ever get over your bullshit.

546
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:21,104
My bullshit?

547
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,506
They've heard worse.

548
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,107
Yeah.

549
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,069
You meet someone,

550
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:27,991
have an actual relationship.

551
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:31,195
Hard to do if you can't even tell
someone what you do for a living.

552
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:33,839
Yeah, that's the bullshit
I'm talking about.

553
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,240
Sammy, guys, bedtime.

554
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:37,241
Uh-uh.

555
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:38,762
Let me just finish this level.

556
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:40,244
What did I say?

557
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:41,765
She is a tyrant.

558
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,527
Yeah. No kidding.

559
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,531
Come on, Jude.

560
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:50,214
You've been working for the
CIA for a long time now, Joe.

561
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:52,256
How is this still
an issue for you?

562
00:32:52,258 --> 00:32:54,899
I guess it's in
my nature to wanna...

563
00:32:54,901 --> 00:32:56,981
Trust a few people.

564
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:59,103
You think Sam gets to tell me
what he does every day?

565
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:00,224
No.

566
00:33:00,226 --> 00:33:02,228
But, at least you know
why he can't.

567
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,590
You know what your problem is?

568
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,271
What, I only have one?

569
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:09,754
Well, that's up for debate.

570
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:12,957
Unlike every other guy
in the universe,

571
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:15,600
you think with your heart,
instead of your dick.

572
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:17,281
Oh.

573
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:19,606
You can't start every first
date contemplating marriage.

574
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:22,969
Get laid. See where it goes.

575
00:33:57,324 --> 00:33:58,523
Hey, babe,
sorry I'm late.

576
00:33:58,525 --> 00:34:01,286
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
Do I know you?

577
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:03,769
Look, this creep's been
following me for six blocks.

578
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:05,771
Pretend you're
my boyfriend, okay?

579
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:07,775
Okay.

580
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:13,060
Is he there?

581
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:15,623
No.

582
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,103
No, I think you're good.

583
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:20,107
Thank you.

584
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:22,430
Anytime.

585
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,580
Thanks for meeting me, Sam.

586
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:57,143
What the fuck's
going on, Nathan?

587
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:59,225
I don't like being
exposed like this.

588
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:01,229
Gareth has been
doing some trades.

589
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:05,271
What kind of trades?

590
00:35:05,273 --> 00:35:09,756
He bought stock
in pharmaceutical companies

591
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:12,520
that manufacture ciprofloxacin.

592
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,365
That greedy motherfucker.

593
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,369
It gets worse.

594
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,610
What?

595
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:27,774
Your friend, Joe Turner.
He found out about them.

596
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:31,898
And... You don't like
being exposed?

597
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,941
We're exposed.

598
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:39,346
- So this guy...
- You know, I thought you were gonna take advantage

599
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,788
of the situation and kiss me.

600
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,513
But you handled yourself
like a perfect gentleman.

601
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:49,318
Club soda and lime, please.

602
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,401
Can I... Can I buy
you a real drink?

603
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:55,082
I can't.

604
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:56,643
Big day at work tomorrow.

605
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:58,647
I need to keep a clear head.

606
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:01,768
What are you saying?

607
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,613
I already sent the
assignment to the assets.

608
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,860
You what?

609
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:16,423
You're mad because you
have a personal connection,

610
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:21,751
but once you get past that, you'll see
that this is really the only way forward.

611
00:36:42,412 --> 00:36:44,414
Water.

612
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,026
What's that?

613
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,191
Sorry, I have a nasty habit of
taking my work home with me.

614
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:05,395
Isn't that usually a sign
of a fulfilling job?

615
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,356
What can I say?

616
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:10,360
I love what I do.

617
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:13,803
How about you?
Are you fulfilled?

618
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:18,889
I don't know.

619
00:37:24,214 --> 00:37:25,734
Your accent,
where's it from?

620
00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:27,415
Cleveland.

621
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:30,018
Oh.

622
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,903
If you're not gonna talk about
yourself, why should I talk about me?

623
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:36,464
Come on.

624
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:40,829
We don't know each other.
You don't even know my name.

625
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:44,114
How often do you get the chance to
be totally honest with someone?

626
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:48,278
All right.

627
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:55,324
I have to lie to people about
what I do for a living,

628
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:59,448
and it makes it hard for me
to get close to anyone.

629
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,452
You carry a lot of guilt.

630
00:38:01,932 --> 00:38:03,934
That's good.

631
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:08,259
I don't feel guilty
about anything.

632
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:13,262
It's okay to be happy.

633
00:38:13,264 --> 00:38:15,424
You're young, strong.

634
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,706
You got a long life
ahead of you.

635
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,428
I really like that.

636
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:35,967
You coming to bed anytime soon?

637
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,687
Ah.

638
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:39,691
I can't sleep.

639
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,536
You okay?

640
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:47,657
Sam, hey.

641
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,138
Sam, what's going on?

642
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,661
Nothing, nothing.

643
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:57,549
I think I'm coming
down with something.

644
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,512
Well, you should
definitely come to bed.

645
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:05,397
Okay, doc.

646
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:16,566
We have parent-teacher night
next Thursday for Jude.

647
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:18,728
I think we should both go
'cause his teacher's a bitch,

648
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,732
and I think I'm gonna lose my
shit if I'm in there by myself.

649
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:23,733
Hey.

650
00:39:23,735 --> 00:39:25,255
Are you even listening to me?

651
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:26,616
Huh?

652
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:28,578
Did you hear
anything I just said?

653
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,381
I'm sorry.

654
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:33,385
I'm sorry, I just...

655
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,028
Got a lot of stuff
on my mind, okay?

656
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,832
Whatever it is,
just let it go.

657
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,715
For once.

658
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,521
Come to bed with me.

659
00:39:56,288 --> 00:39:58,290
I'll be there in
a minute, okay?

660
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:06,838
<i>Sam?</i>

661
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,720
<i>Hi, Bob.</i>

662
00:41:08,722 --> 00:41:10,642
<i>Are you at home?</i>

663
00:41:10,644 --> 00:41:12,646
<i>There's too much
going on to be at home.</i>

664
00:41:13,327 --> 00:41:14,726
<i>I'm at Nazari's.</i>

665
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:17,451
<i>I'm gonna head over.
I wanna run something by you.</i>

666
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:44,518
Hi, Bob.

667
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,361
You seen Nazari's bed?

668
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,724
Yeah.

669
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:53,886
- Hospital corners.
- Yeah.

670
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,088
What compels a man
about to walk a plague

671
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,372
into a football stadium
to make his bed?

672
00:42:04,378 --> 00:42:06,380
Well, I guess...

673
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:13,187
When you're in a combat zone, those
little routines are a big comfort.

674
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:16,308
Yeah.

675
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,514
I remember combat zones
being less comfortable.

676
00:42:21,316 --> 00:42:23,318
Not much.

677
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:29,924
Did I ever tell you
I met your father once?

678
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,168
In Nha Trang.

679
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:39,532
I guess you saw a lot of shit.

680
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:42,377
I mean it's a hell of a
sacrifice to make for nothing.

681
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:56,790
We were born after all the
good wars were already over.

682
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,794
The world has changed.

683
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:03,636
These people used to
want a seat at the table.

684
00:43:03,638 --> 00:43:05,640
Now they wanna blow
the table up.

685
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:08,203
How do you...

686
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:12,087
How do you fight
an enemy like that?

687
00:43:20,576 --> 00:43:22,578
So what did you
wanna talk about?

688
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:31,705
You're right.

689
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:34,310
You can't fight an enemy
like that, not like that.

690
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,049
Hello?

691
00:44:27,724 --> 00:44:28,883
Hey.

692
00:44:28,885 --> 00:44:30,445
Power's out on the whole block.

693
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:31,726
Back-up generator's dead.

694
00:44:31,728 --> 00:44:33,730
Huh.

695
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:36,210
Dr. Lappe...

696
00:44:36,212 --> 00:44:38,052
Did you read my report
about the pharma stock trades?

697
00:44:38,054 --> 00:44:41,258
Yes, I'm sending it up to Langley
as soon as the power comes on.

698
00:44:48,945 --> 00:44:50,947
Morning, Colonel.

699
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:54,909
Arms up.

700
00:44:58,355 --> 00:45:00,515
I'm gonna miss my flight.

701
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:01,957
Turner,

702
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:04,519
I may not have the most
glamorous job in the world,

703
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:08,763
but believe it or not,
I derive some satisfaction

704
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:10,045
in doing it well.

705
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:12,049
What time are you gonna
pick me up for dinner?

706
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:16,972
My job is to protect everyone
that works in this building.

707
00:45:16,974 --> 00:45:19,254
You going on the fire escape
for your cigarette breaks

708
00:45:19,256 --> 00:45:23,699
is a breach of security that puts you
and everyone who works here in danger.

709
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:25,741
I'm giving you
one last warning.

710
00:45:25,743 --> 00:45:27,745
If I catch you again,
I'm writing you up.

711
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,828
There's one T in Turner.

712
00:45:31,989 --> 00:45:33,991
You're an asshole.

713
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:40,598
Morning.

714
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,122
Morning.

715
00:45:48,806 --> 00:45:50,808
What's wrong?

716
00:45:53,331 --> 00:45:55,411
- Hey.
- Hi.

717
00:45:55,413 --> 00:45:57,413
Soy vanilla latte, right?

718
00:45:57,415 --> 00:45:59,054
Harold, you didn't
have to do that.

719
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,380
I know, but I wanted to, so...

720
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,064
Also, hey, um,

721
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:10,826
so I was thinking
maybe, maybe...

722
00:46:10,828 --> 00:46:14,112
Um, you and I could
do something some night.

723
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,032
Or something.

724
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:18,995
Harold, you seem
like a nice guy.

725
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:20,997
Well.

726
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:23,519
But you've been chatting me up every
day since you started working here,

727
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:26,562
and I've been very careful to
give you no indication whatsoever

728
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:29,846
that I might be at all interested
in seeing you outside the office,

729
00:46:29,848 --> 00:46:33,411
precisely to avoid you asking me out
and having to hurt your feelings.

730
00:46:35,013 --> 00:46:37,015
I know.

731
00:46:37,816 --> 00:46:41,377
I just thought, you know, maybe the
drugs that I put in your coffee might

732
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:42,899
change your mind.

733
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,903
What?

734
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:51,790
Bitch.

735
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:54,753
Sharla called me a hypocrite.

736
00:46:57,276 --> 00:47:00,437
Gave me a guilt trip
about how she'd work too hard

737
00:47:00,439 --> 00:47:04,000
in recovery getting
to know herself to

738
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:07,406
waste time with someone who couldn't even
admit who they were to their own parents.

739
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,612
Get right in there.

740
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:30,307
You spent half a decade
behind that desk,

741
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,029
believing that you're
protecting all of us

742
00:47:32,031 --> 00:47:34,712
just in case something
terrible happened.

743
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:37,116
Your life's purpose was
a pitiful delusion.

744
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:42,121
That flew right by my ear.
What the hell?

745
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:55,092
Look out!

746
00:48:14,914 --> 00:48:16,916
Go! Get out! Go!

747
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,322
Go, go, go.

748
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:33,333
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

749
00:48:34,654 --> 00:48:36,656
No, no, no.

750
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:39,860
Oh, Jesus.

751
00:48:55,195 --> 00:48:57,197
He's in the basement.

752
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,602
<i>Hey, it's me.
I'm in Saudi.</i>

753
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:25,086
<i>Package has landed.
I'll await the courier.</i>

754
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:02,645
<i>Pentagon.</i>

755
00:51:26,471 --> 00:51:30,541
