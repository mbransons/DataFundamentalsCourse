1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,743
Ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,769
The overture
to "Duel In The Sun."

4
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,767
"Duel In The Sun,"
two years in the making...

5
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:16,781
is a saga of Texas
in the 1880's...

6
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:19,784
when primitive passions
rode the raw frontier...

7
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,286
of an expanding nation.

8
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,290
Here, the forces of evil
were in constant conflict...

9
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:29,283
with the deeper morality
of the hearty pioneers...

10
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,297
and here,
as in this story we tell...

11
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:36,290
a grim fate lay waiting
for the transgressor...

12
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,496
upon the laws of God and man.

13
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,317
The characters
in "Duel In The Sun"...

14
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,320
are builded out of the legends
of a colorful era...

15
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,323
when a million acres
were one man's estate...

16
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:02,259
and another man's life was held
as lightly as a woman's virtue.

17
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,762
The character
of the sinkiller...

18
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,255
is based upon those bogus
unordained evangelists...

19
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,758
who preyed upon the hungry need
for spiritual guidance...

20
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,932
and who are recognized
as charlatans...

21
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,137
by the intelligent
and God-fearing.

22
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,315
"Duel In The Sun."

23
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,264
Deep among the lonely
sun-baked hills of Texas...

24
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,769
the great and weather-beaten
stone still stands.

25
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:39,273
The Comanches called it
Squaw's Head Rock.

26
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,776
Time cannot change
its impassive face...

27
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,790
nor dim the legend
of the wild young lovers...

28
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:50,784
who found heaven and hell
in the shadows of the rock.

29
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,297
For when the sun is low...

30
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,301
and the cold wind blows
across the desert...

31
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,064
there are those
of Indian blood...

32
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,798
who still speak
of Pearl Chavez...

33
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,739
the half-breed girl
from down along the border...

34
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:04,742
and of the laughing outlaw...

35
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:08,234
with whom she here kept
a final rendezvous...

36
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,249
never to be seen again.

37
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,252
And this is
what the legend says...

38
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,254
A flower known nowhere else...

39
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,756
grows from out
of the desperate crags...

40
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,758
where Pearl vanished...

41
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,761
Pearl, who was herself
a wild flower...

42
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:28,255
sprung from the hard clay,
quick to blossom...

43
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,291
and early to die.

44
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:57,990
Pearl.

45
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,227
Where's your ma?

46
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,234
She's in there, dancing.

47
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:05,736
Like mother, like daughter.

48
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm commencing to think
I like the daughter better.

49
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,238
Let go!

50
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,301
You go away from me,
or I'll call my pa.

51
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,748
That renegade creole squaw-man?

52
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,512
That's a rich one.

53
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,715
I'll just raise you
fifty, Mr. Chavez.

54
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,227
Would you mind?

55
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,729
Mind what?

56
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,732
That weed.
I find it rather repulsive.

57
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,735
Pretty fancy gentleman,
ain't you, Mr. Chavez?

58
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,068
He's not so fancy
about his wife, if you ask me.

59
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,664
Look at her.

60
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,762
Quitting? Broke again?

61
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,601
Yes, gentlemen...

62
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,607
but there are
greater tragedies...

63
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,973
that I'm sure
you wouldn't understand.

64
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,945
Pa!

65
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,347
Pa, will you take me
in the Presidio?

66
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,755
I ain't never
been in there and...

67
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,259
And you never should be.

68
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,262
What are you doing out here
at this hour anyway?

69
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,763
I was just dancing.

70
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,265
I've told your mother
repeatedly...

71
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,767
this street is no place
for a girl your age.

72
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,633
I didn't mean no harm.

73
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,698
It's my fault, child, not yours.

74
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,235
The sins of the fathers.

75
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,217
Go home now, dear.

76
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:15,742
I'll be back in a little while.

77
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,905
Don't! Stop!

78
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,435
No, Chavez! Don't!

79
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:46,307
Don't! Don't! I beg you! Don't!

80
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,187
Pa!

81
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,262
I plead no mitigating
circumstances.

82
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:01,265
They deserved to die,
as I deserve to die.

83
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,267
For I long since
killed a person...

84
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:06,759
much superior
to either of them... myself.

85
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,774
I killed that person the day
I gave my family's name...

86
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,777
to the woman
who became my wife.

87
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,278
And since I believe...

88
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,280
the punishment
should fit the crime...

89
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:19,306
I suggest that you hang me
by the neck until I am dead.

90
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,289
It's from Laura Belle.

91
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:28,121
Did I ever tell you about her?

92
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,990
She's my second cousin.

93
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,056
Yes, Laura Belle
is my second cousin...

94
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,296
but she was
more than that to me.

95
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:42,295
You see, once upon a time,
in a different age...

96
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,141
in a different age
and such a different world...

97
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,305
I was in love.

98
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:52,510
And wonderful to believe,
the lady was in love with me.

99
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,317
You mustn't look at me
as though that were impossible.

100
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:59,255
I was quite the looker
in my day and very dashing.

101
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,250
Perhaps a bit too dashing.

102
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,753
And that's why
this very wonderful girl...

103
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,759
who might have been your mother,
decided on security...

104
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,796
and gave herself in wedlock
to a wealthy yankee.

105
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,307
Better make it fast, Chavez.

106
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,775
You've only got
five minutes left.

107
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,641
No! No!

108
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,538
They can't.

109
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,278
They can't. I won't let them.

110
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,286
Better that it end.

111
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,220
Really it is.

112
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,952
Your mother and I
can't hurt you any longer.

113
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,791
Laura Belle wants
my little girl to go to her.

114
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,797
Yes, just a few more weeks...

115
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,799
and at last,
you'll have a home...

116
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,767
the mother you should have had.

117
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,828
No, you mustn't leave me.
You mustn't.

118
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,309
You've been a good child.

119
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,311
Through some miracle,
you're good...

120
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,813
and you're decent,
and you're strong.

121
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,816
And now you must prove
that you are strong.

122
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,751
You will do that for me,
won't you, darling?

123
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:04,254
No tears, no grief...

124
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,780
now or later.

125
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,722
Here. Keep this scarf.

126
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,767
Wear it sometimes.

127
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:19,463
Get her out of here, Chavez.

128
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,769
Listen to me, darling.
We've very little time.

129
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:25,776
I want you to lean
on Laura Belle...

130
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,278
make her your inspiration
and your guide.

131
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,282
And then one day,
you'll be the great lady...

132
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,285
I've always wanted you to be.

133
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,787
Promise me that.

134
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,288
I promise.

135
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,813
Cross your heart?

136
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,793
Cross my heart.

137
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,795
She'll love you.
I know she will.

138
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:48,731
And you must give her
all the love you've had for me.

139
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,809
Smile for me.

140
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:02,279
Now, now. Head high.

141
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,012
Strong.

142
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,778
Very strong.

143
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,268
All threats of hell
and hopes of paradise...

144
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,770
one thing at least
is certain...

145
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,773
this life flies.

146
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:32,766
One thing is certain,
and the rest is lies.

147
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:38,272
The flower that once
has bloomed forever dies.

148
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,284
Ready, Chavez?

149
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,309
Quite ready, sheriff.

150
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,825
Whoa!

151
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,746
I beg your pardon.

152
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,248
You can't be...
What's your name?

153
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:13,273
None of your business.

154
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:16,776
Sorry.

155
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,260
I really am sorry.
I wonder if I could...

156
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:26,263
I don't talk to no strangers.

157
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:30,757
That's a good rule generally,
I grant you, but...

158
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,793
in this case, it...

159
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,273
Come on.

160
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,275
Won't you answer
just one question?

161
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:39,776
What is it?

162
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,438
Did you see
a little southern tot...

163
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,946
on the Guadalupe coach?

164
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,970
No.

165
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,451
Are you sure?
She was traveling alone.

166
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,282
You said "one question."

167
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,788
I know, but it doesn't
seem unreasonable if you...

168
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,791
Now you go away
and leave me alone.

169
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,793
I know all about men like you.

170
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,317
Well...

171
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,263
Good morning.

172
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,734
Why couldn't they have been
a little more explicit...

173
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,736
about just which coach
they were sending her on?

174
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,237
Don't worry, Jesse.

175
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,570
I'll drive her out to the ranch
whenever she shows up.

176
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:11,074
Thanks, Lem.
You can't miss her.

177
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,576
She's one of those...

178
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,077
well-brought-up
southern children.

179
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,739
Probably be hungry
and crying her eyes out.

180
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,749
I'll give her some milk
and blow her nose for her.

181
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,273
Thanks again.

182
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:22,919
And... so long!

183
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,546
So long.

184
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,581
Give my regards to the old man.

185
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,786
I will.

186
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,763
Say hello to Laura Belle for me.

187
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,287
Wait!

188
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,468
Wait! Do you know
somebody named Laura Belle?

189
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,263
I said, do you know
somebody named Laura Belle?

190
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,776
None of your business.

191
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,277
It is my business.

192
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,109
I don't talk to no strangers.

193
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,944
You can answer
one question, can't you?

194
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,506
That won't hurt you none.

195
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,519
All right, one question.
But remember, just one.

196
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,282
I know all about girls like you.

197
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,790
Don't you dare say that.

198
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,223
Pearl.

199
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,988
How'd you know my name?

200
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:04,722
If you hadn't been so uppity...

201
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,889
I'd have known who you were
a long time ago.

202
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:08,558
Now come on. Get in.

203
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,067
Who are you?

204
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,898
My mother couldn't come
to meet you...

205
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,403
so I came in her place.

206
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:16,236
I'm Laura Belle's son...
the older one, Jesse.

207
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,332
There.

208
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,262
I'm sorry about
not recognizing you.

209
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,764
I guess your clothes
sort of fooled me.

210
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,266
Don't misunderstand me.
I think they're beautiful.

211
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,768
You do?

212
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:47,771
Yes, and very unusual.
But you know...

213
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:50,273
I think I'd like to see you
in brighter colors.

214
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,276
Like green?
I have a green blouse.

215
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,938
- Green, blue, yellow maybe.
- Yellow?

216
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,947
I have a real pretty
yellow one right here.

217
00:26:56,981 --> 00:27:00,542
- I'll put it on now.
- Not now.

218
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,985
Save it for tomorrow.

219
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,235
Here's where the ranch starts.

220
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:22,933
There's the marker...
the Spanish Bit...

221
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,238
a million acres
of McCanles empire.

222
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,744
Empire? Isn't this still Texas?

223
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,510
Yes, but the Senator doesn't
always acknowledge that. Look.

224
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,983
He puts his seal
of ownership on everything.

225
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:36,248
It's on his sons, too,
I suppose.

226
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,255
In fact, I'm sure
my brother Lewt and I...

227
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,257
are the Senator's
favorite property.

228
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,260
Is your brother as nice
as you are?

229
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,694
Girls in town think he's nicer.

230
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:49,759
- Hiya, Jesse.
- Howdy, Jake.

231
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,292
Fine foals.

232
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,872
Is that your house?

233
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,779
That is the residence

234
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,376
of Jackson Tilt McCanles
and family.

235
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:11,821
And on to the fortress...
and happiness.

236
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:33,740
Jesse! Pearl!

237
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,260
Here you are.

238
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:53,286
Prettiest girl ever to set foot
on Spanish Bit.

239
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,189
Pearl, dear.

240
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:59,394
I'm so glad you've
come to us, darling.

241
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,201
Here, let me look at you.

242
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,800
Yes, you're Scott's daughter.

243
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:06,309
And now you're ours.

244
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,039
You're just like he said.

245
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,707
I'm afraid I'm somewhat
different than he remembered.

246
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:12,238
But come, dear.

247
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,217
Did you take good care
of her, Jesse?

248
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,220
I showed her all
the points of interest.

249
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,223
- He did. He's nice.
- I think so, too.

250
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,157
You southern belles
are all alike.

251
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,228
Where in holleration
you been all day?

252
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,060
I just went down
to Paradise Flats.

253
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,931
- Senator, this is Pearl.
- Who?

254
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:31,400
Pearl Chavez, our cousin.

255
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,768
You remember. We invited her
to come and stay with us.

256
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,002
Don't be scared.
You're not a trespasser.

257
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,373
She's no cousin of mine.

258
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,241
She's Scott Chavez's
daughter, ain't she?

259
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,247
Yes, of course she is.

260
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,909
Why don't you say so?

261
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,319
Girl, what are you doing
in that getup?

262
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:52,322
Is that the latest fashion...

263
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:56,258
with them aristocratic
cousins of yours?

264
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:00,993
Or is it what they're
wearing this season in wigwams?

265
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:06,094
Come on, boy.
We got to talk business.

266
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,604
See you later, Pearl.

267
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,766
Come, dear.
I'll take you to your room.

268
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,275
He don't want me here.

269
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,279
You mustn't mind the Senator.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

270
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,281
It's his way ever since...

271
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,283
ever since his accident.

272
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,784
Accident?

273
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,285
It's a long story...

274
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,288
and, I'm afraid,
not a very pleasant one.

275
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,290
I wish we had
a better room for you...

276
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,122
but later on,
we'll speak to the Senator.

277
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,321
Lewton, dear.

278
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,828
This is Pearl.
My youngest son... Lewton.

279
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:43,270
Pleased to meet you, Lewton.

280
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:46,299
Pleased to meet you...

281
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,709
Pearl.

282
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,670
Come, Pearl.

283
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,309
You and Lewton will have
plenty of time later on...

284
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,546
to get to know one another.

285
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:58,851
I'm sure we will.

286
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,687
Yay... boy.

287
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:17,933
Sounds of the rude world

288
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:21,536
Heard in the day

289
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,774
Lulled by the moonlight

290
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:28,148
Have all passed away

291
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:33,488
Beautiful dreamer

292
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:37,051
Queen of my song

293
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:40,791
List' while I woo thee...

294
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,800
Where will I put
your medicine, Mrs. McCanles?

295
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:46,325
Leave it on the table.

296
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:50,807
Mrs. McCanles,
can I get married?

297
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:53,309
But, Vashti, whom do
you want to marry?

298
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,312
Nobody in particular, ma'am.

299
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,315
I just thought I'd kind of
like to get married.

300
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,816
Of course, Vashti.

301
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,750
You may marry
whenever you wish.

302
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,777
Thank you, ma'am.

303
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:06,756
Do you know anybody...

304
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,816
who would be nice
for me to marry?

305
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,559
No, I don't,
but I'll think about it.

306
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,759
Thank you, ma'am.

307
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,360
There's no particular hurry.

308
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,267
That Vashti.

309
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:23,603
I'm afraid I'll never be able
to train her properly.

310
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,302
And as to marriage...

311
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,938
Sit down.

312
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,676
I'm glad your father
sent you to me.

313
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,276
All you have to do
is behave like a lady.

314
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:36,286
Not that
Scott Chavez's daughter...

315
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,288
could ever be anything
but a lady.

316
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:40,290
I'm a good girl, ma'am.

317
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:44,954
Of course you are, dear,
but you see...

318
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:48,295
you'll be the only young girl
at Spanish Bit.

319
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:49,959
No one could blame you...

320
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,730
if your head
were turned a little.

321
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,294
You take Lewton, for instance.

322
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:56,806
He's such an attractive boy.

323
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,809
I think Jesse's much nicer.

324
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,073
But you scarcely know Lewton.

325
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,239
Of course, he's
a bit undisciplined...

326
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,739
but perhaps that's what gives
westerners their charm.

327
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,252
The Senator was like that.

328
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,687
That's why, when your father...

329
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:17,250
Jesse always chides me
for talking about the past.

330
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,922
I hope Jesse likes me.

331
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,760
We're going to lose him someday.

332
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,256
I've known that ever since
he came back from law school.

333
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,929
I've been so selfish.

334
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,770
He'd have gone long ago
if it weren't for me.

335
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,776
My firstborn... he's so good.

336
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,769
He's made such
a difference in my life.

337
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,942
- Ma'am?
- Yes, Pearl?

338
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,282
I'll be a good girl.

339
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,788
I promise I will.

340
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,290
I want to be like you.

341
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,294
That's what my father wanted.

342
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,297
I'm afraid neither
your father nor I...

343
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,299
found happiness, child.

344
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,824
I hope you will.

345
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,239
Come, child.

346
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,741
This is no way to begin.

347
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:07,175
Do you know this waltz?

348
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:15,582
Will you stop
that infernal instrument!

349
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,450
King me, Senator.

350
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:21,185
I always figured when I moved
into my own quarters...

351
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,749
I'd be rid of that noise.

352
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,761
I guess that's it, Senator.

353
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:27,263
I think I'll take me
a little stroll.

354
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:30,756
Now we got that papoose
to put up with.

355
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:32,769
I don't know.

356
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:35,169
She looks like
a pretty cute tamale to me.

357
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,664
You think so?
Wouldn't appeal to me none.

358
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:42,941
Of course, I always
liked my women more...

359
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,313
Say, Senator.

360
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,783
Yeah, Lewt?

361
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:49,786
You know that last trip
I took up to Abilene?

362
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,946
Yeah.

363
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:54,287
I was driving the herd all day
and kind of tired...

364
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,293
and felt like getting
some relaxation.

365
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,295
Yeah. Didn't happen
to drop into a place...

366
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,229
called the Last Chance, did you?

367
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,232
How did you find that out?

368
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,734
Sent them a check
for 1,600 just yesterday.

369
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,737
That's how I found out.

370
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,229
I guess I had
a few drinks too many.

371
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,242
That's all right.

372
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,245
A fella's got to sow
some wild oats sometime.

373
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,247
What's the money for?

374
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,249
Senator...

375
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,683
I hope someday I'll be like you.

376
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,747
The only thing
I don't like about you...

377
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,260
is the miserable way
you play poker.

378
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,754
Trying to fill inside straights
is a sucker's game.

379
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,791
Go on, boy. Go on. Run along.

380
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,133
What a boy.

381
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:56,017
How'd they come
to name you Pearl?

382
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,112
I don't know, sir.

383
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:01,318
Couldn't have had
much eye for color, could they?

384
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:10,257
They might better have called
you Pocahontas or Minnehaha.

385
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,825
Ain't that right?

386
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,667
I guess so.

387
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,731
All right, Minne, on your way.

388
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,243
Good night, sir.

389
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:23,041
Minne... ha ha.

390
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,241
Ha ha.

391
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,250
Hello, Pearl. What's the matter?

392
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:30,776
Are you unhappy?
Don't you like Spanish Bit?

393
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,257
If everybody was like you.

394
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,259
If everybody was like me,
the world would be...

395
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,261
a terribly frustrated
sort of place.

396
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:39,762
What do you mean?

397
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,766
Nothing for you to worry
your pretty little head about.

398
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,768
I want to learn.
Will you learn me?

399
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,770
Your ma says you're a lawyer.

400
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,773
I want to be a lady
and know everything, like her.

401
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,776
I wonder if learning
ever made mother any happier.

402
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,278
- I wish I could do that.
- What?

403
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,780
Make rings like that.
Can I try? Let me try.

404
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,215
No, Pearl. Now whoa.

405
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,242
Ladies aren't supposed to smoke.

406
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,224
Now you won't want
to learn me things, will you?

407
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,726
You don't like me
no more, do you?

408
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,251
Of course I do.

409
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,757
I'm afraid a lot of men
will want to learn you things.

410
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,241
I think you better go to bed...

411
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,267
like a good little girl.

412
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:32,745
We'll discuss your education
another time.

413
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,751
All right.

414
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,753
Good night, Pearl.

415
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,778
Good night, Jesse.

416
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,301
Good night.

417
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,261
What do you want?

418
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,257
I hate you!

419
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,260
Don't you pretend
nobody ever did that before.

420
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:53,627
They didn't. Nobody did.
Nobody's going to.

421
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,296
You little...

422
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,131
You leave that alone!

423
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,738
I reckon he must be
the white half.

424
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:16,283
I forgot to say
good night, ma'am.

425
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:29,225
Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child

426
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:34,568
That ain't no ham, Miss Pearl.
That's a pig.

427
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,232
Same thing.

428
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,741
But Mrs. McCanles,
she's very particular...

429
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:43,736
and she don't want no big pig
listed like no little ham.

430
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,249
Here. Maybe you better
make the list, Vashti.

431
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,251
No, ma'am. I can't write.

432
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,244
Mrs. McCanles says to me once,
"Vashti, can you write?"

433
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,257
And I says, "Mrs. McCanles..."

434
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,259
Vashti.

435
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,421
Mrs. McCanles says to me once,
"Vashti, can you write?"

436
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,260
And I says, "Mrs. McCanles..."

437
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,765
Vashti!

438
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,267
Mrs. McCanles says...

439
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,768
Vashti!

440
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,431
That's Mr. Lewt.
I think he wants to see me.

441
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,905
Vashti, where are you?

442
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,773
I'm scared of that Mr. Lewt.

443
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,268
He says to me once,
"Vashti, you're empty-headed."

444
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,280
Vashti!

445
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,282
Tell Miss Pearl
to come out here.

446
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,647
Miss Pearl...

447
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,482
I heard him. Tell him I'm busy.

448
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,953
Why don't you tell him...

449
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:26,717
and I'll just run along
up to the house?

450
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,123
All right, I'll tell him.

451
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,151
What do you want?

452
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,790
Thought you might like
to see some tricks.

453
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,322
Watch this.

454
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,297
That's a good boy.

455
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:55,941
Hey, Lewt.

456
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,383
What do you want?

457
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,686
I thought you were supposed to
be on the round-up today.

458
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,589
And suppose you tend
to your mortgages...

459
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,254
and stop sticking your nose
in my business.

460
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,729
Just as one civilized man
to another, l...

461
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,255
if that isn't insulting you...

462
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:11,267
I have a little
suggestion to make.

463
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:13,269
All right. Let's have it.

464
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:16,534
Why don't you
leave this one alone?

465
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:19,633
She may do very nicely
if given half a chance.

466
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,946
What's the matter, judge?

467
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,813
You got her earmarked
for yourself?

468
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,515
Hey, Pearl.

469
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,296
Come on, Dice. Push.

470
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,389
Whoa.

471
00:41:42,432 --> 00:41:44,593
Give me a good push.

472
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,339
Whoa, boy.
I want you to meet a lady.

473
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,009
Now bow for the lady, Dice.

474
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:00,282
He's right smart.

475
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,620
What do you think
of my new girl, Dice?

476
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,760
Oh? Maybe not.

477
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,194
Did you teach him all that?

478
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,089
All that and lots more.

479
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,931
He'll turn on a dime
and give you change.

480
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,938
- Do you want to try him?
- Me ride him?

481
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,439
You're just having fun with me.

482
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:24,940
Or can't you ride bareback?

483
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,773
- Of course I can.
- Let me see you.

484
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,143
I could show you,
but I got work to do.

485
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,809
Of course, if you don't dare,
I don't give a doggone.

486
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,081
Yeah?

487
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:41,784
Get off him.

488
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,793
Sure enough. He won't throw you.

489
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,818
He's smooth as cream.

490
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,327
Come on!

491
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,341
Now git!

492
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,186
Open the gate!

493
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,769
You all right?

494
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,754
That was a fool thing to say.

495
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,190
You never rode bareback
before in your life.

496
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,994
I never said I had.

497
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,930
Is she hurt, Lewt?

498
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,593
No. Get out of here.

499
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,101
Can we do anything?

500
00:44:32,135 --> 00:44:34,262
Go on and mosey, will you?

501
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,795
Sure.

502
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,949
You got gumption,
but you ain't got no sense.

503
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,780
If you'd only let me
start him right...

504
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,786
instead of scaring him that way.

505
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,788
It wasn't him that was scared.

506
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,790
He won't throw me next time.

507
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,621
You better stick
to buggy-riding.

508
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,786
Maybe him and me
ain't your style.

509
00:44:57,828 --> 00:45:00,228
Ain't no maybe about you.

510
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:02,231
I wish you'd let me
ride him some more.

511
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:04,028
Sure.

512
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,035
How'd you like me
to give him to you?

513
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:08,731
You mean for keeps?
You're not just teasing?

514
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,740
No. I guess you'd
rather have Jesse...

515
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,401
pick you out a riding horse...

516
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:14,239
even if he don't know
the difference...

517
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:16,245
between a pinto
and a strawberry roan.

518
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:17,746
I like this one.

519
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,749
And you like me,
don't you, honey?

520
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,751
You won't throw me no more.

521
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,117
All right. He's yours.

522
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:35,261
Let's you and me ride down
to the sump after supper, huh?

523
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:36,765
Where's that?

524
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,769
A shady place
over by Hidden Canyon.

525
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:43,933
The water's good and deep now,
almost over your head.

526
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,602
You mean go swimming... together?

527
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,942
I'll bring along my guitar,
play us some music.

528
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,447
You got a nerve.

529
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,779
The moon will be
pretty near full.

530
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:56,786
You didn't buy me,
just giving me a horse.

531
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,722
I'll be waiting for you
after supper out by the bell.

532
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,748
I won't go.

533
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,923
I won't!

534
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,238
Listen to this for poppycock.

535
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,241
"And the benefits
to be derived...

536
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:22,234
"by the small ranchers
from the new railroad...

537
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:26,340
"are too numerous
to need recounting here."

538
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,907
"Small ranchers."

539
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,579
Ignorant, nasty,
spoiling the open range...

540
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,247
with their measly fences.

541
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,258
And say, Jesse.
I should have told you before.

542
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,260
Them surveyors had the gall...

543
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,762
to come traipsing
over Spanish Bit...

544
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,629
with them infernal
spyglasses of theirs.

545
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,260
I almost fired
that new foreman Ken...

546
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,133
for letting them on the place.

547
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,599
Shouldn't have
done that, Senator.

548
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,937
Why not?

549
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,772
Because it wasn't Ken
who let them on the place.

550
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,778
Nobody else would
have had the nerve.

551
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:58,372
I was the one that told them
they could do it.

552
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,145
- Have you gone plumb crazy?
- I don't think so.

553
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:03,209
I thought it might be
a good idea to cooperate...

554
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,721
and have the tracks where
they'd do the most good.

555
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:08,121
Good? What do you mean good?

556
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,682
It's getting rather cool,
don't you think?

557
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,717
For one thing...

558
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:14,229
the railroad will bring
new people, a school.

559
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,425
Paradise Flats will become
a real town instead of...

560
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,730
And that same railway
will ship...

561
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:22,226
a lot of emigrants
from up north down here...

562
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,935
and they'll start in voting
and putting in taxes.

563
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,240
It's your ranch.

564
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,940
I was just trying to be helpful.

565
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,745
Spanish Bit's going to
belong to you someday...

566
00:47:37,787 --> 00:47:39,448
you and Lewt.

567
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,252
So I don't see why you don't...

568
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,259
Senator, I know
you mean well for me.

569
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,261
You've always been
generous to us.

570
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,763
Maybe Lewt and I would be closer
to what you wanted us to be...

571
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:49,287
if you hadn't been so generous.

572
00:47:49,332 --> 00:47:51,800
What's wrong with Lewt?

573
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,462
Nothing at all
that you'd object to.

574
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,596
That's not the point.
I'm the one who's the maverick.

575
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,972
I don't know
what you're talking about.

576
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:02,035
I'd like one McCanles to give
something to this state...

577
00:48:02,078 --> 00:48:03,705
and not just take from it.

578
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,680
Good night, sir.

579
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,090
Your son, ma'am?

580
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,426
Yes, Senator.

581
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,236
Who's there?

582
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,738
Is that you, Jesse?

583
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:34,039
Hello, Pearl. Nice night.
Want to take a little walk?

584
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,739
It's kind of late.
I think I'd better go...

585
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,749
Where were you going when l...

586
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:44,846
Got to get me
somebody to love

587
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,913
I...

588
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,584
I guess that's Lewt.

589
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,252
Certainly is Lewt.
He's the best serenader...

590
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:51,920
this side of the Rio Grande.

591
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:55,261
I don't care if he is.
Him and his old guitar.

592
00:48:55,298 --> 00:48:58,233
Just because he gave me a horse.

593
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,704
I know why, too.
He can't fool me none.

594
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,104
That's a horse
on Lewt, isn't it?

595
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,700
I didn't really
want to meet him.

596
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,711
Honest, I didn't.

597
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,714
It was just that
I was kind of lonesome and...

598
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,215
I know.

599
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,947
Do you still want me
to take that walk with you?

600
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:20,218
I don't know why not.

601
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,249
Lewt can supply the charming
musical background.

602
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:31,731
Got to get me
somebody to love

603
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,759
I'll be...

604
00:49:56,826 --> 00:49:58,259
Thanks, Lewt.

605
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:00,923
You're a better wrangler
than all of them.

606
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:02,932
Sid, see that chestnut
over there?

607
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,934
She looks lame.
Take her out to pasture.

608
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,230
Sure.

609
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,759
It's hotter than a stove lid.

610
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,773
Sure wish we was over
at the sump right now.

611
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,105
And somebody else figures
the same way, I reckon.

612
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,974
Looks like she's heading
for a cool-off.

613
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,379
- I'll see you later.
- Where are you going, boss?

614
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:25,149
- I got business.
- That lucky stiff.

615
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,487
I wish I was a McCanles.

616
00:50:49,612 --> 00:50:51,341
Good afternoon.

617
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:54,881
How's that water?
As cool as it looks?

618
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,408
You go away from here.

619
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,717
- Care for a swimming lesson?
- No.

620
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:01,121
What if I just stay around,
keep you company?

621
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:02,283
Don't you dare.

622
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,589
I'm sorry, honey.
I can't hear a word you say.

623
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:05,958
Move over.

624
00:51:05,995 --> 00:51:07,485
You can't come in here.

625
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,498
Just act like I'm not even here.

626
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,731
Act like we never even met.

627
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:30,548
You disappointed?

628
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:37,657
If you ain't the lowest,
dirtiest, meanest...

629
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,662
Come on out.
I ain't stopping you.

630
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,254
I can't, with you there.

631
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:44,824
Wait till it's plumb dark,
for all I care.

632
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,501
Let go! Let me down!

633
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,976
Making me late for supper
just to be mean!

634
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,478
What will your ma think?

635
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,310
If you hadn't been so doggone
scared I'd see something...

636
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:01,249
you'd have been home
a long time ago.

637
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,616
Little tiger cat.

638
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,783
Evening, Pearl.
Have a good swim?

639
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,561
Let me through!

640
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,965
Am I too late for supper?

641
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,267
I mean, is everybody finished?

642
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,273
Mrs. McCanles say anything?

643
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,765
Yes, ma'am.
She said, "Where's Miss Pearl?"

644
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,779
And I said, "I don't know,
Mrs. McCanles."

645
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,781
And she said,
"Where's Mr. Lewton?"

646
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,283
And I said,
"I don't know, ma'am."

647
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,784
And she said, "Well..."

648
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,014
Pearl, dearest.

649
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,783
I was so worried about you.

650
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,290
Sorry, ma'am.

651
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,292
What happened?

652
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,793
I went riding.

653
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,796
With Lewton?

654
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,264
Vashti, get Miss Pearl
some supper.

655
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,630
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,294
The Senator's
got rules about supper.

657
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,303
He says to me,
"Don't you ever..."

658
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,100
- Vashti.
- Yes, ma'am.

659
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,801
Did you go riding with Lewton?

660
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,241
No, ma'am...

661
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:02,244
I didn't go riding with Lewton.

662
00:53:02,278 --> 00:53:04,746
He wasn't here
for supper either.

663
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,248
He's coming.

664
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:08,250
But he wasn't with you?

665
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:11,253
We just happened to meet up.

666
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:14,450
I see.
But why is your hair wet?

667
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,262
I was down to the sump.

668
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:22,264
You went in swimming?

669
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:24,266
Yes, ma'am.

670
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,790
With Lewton?

671
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:28,793
No, ma'am.

672
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,271
I didn't, ma'am.
Honest, I didn't.

673
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:34,276
I didn't, ma'am.

674
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,744
All right, Pearl. L...

675
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,141
Evening, ma.

676
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,774
Good evening, Lewton.

677
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:44,583
Sorry to be late.
We were down to the sump.

678
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:51,783
I think I'll take a ride
over to El Paso tomorrow...

679
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,296
and get me a little fun
and relaxation.

680
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,298
Anything I can bring you, ma?

681
00:53:56,332 --> 00:53:57,959
No, thank you.

682
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,231
Pearl, I think
I'll try to get you one...

683
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,238
of them newfangled
bathing suits.

684
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:06,902
She swims real well, ma.
Where'd you learn?

685
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,433
Oh, my dear!

686
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,248
You... you varmint!

687
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,842
What you getting
your bristles up about?

688
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,949
Giddy!

689
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:30,264
Miss Pearl, wake up.

690
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,268
What is it?

691
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:34,270
What's the matter?

692
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,771
Well...

693
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,272
What time is it?

694
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,275
It must have been about 9:00...

695
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,777
when Mrs. McCanles
says to me, "Vashti...

696
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:45,269
"when Mr. Jubal Crabby
gets here..."

697
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:49,012
What is it? Who's Mr. Crabby?

698
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,282
Why did you wake me up?

699
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,788
I almost forgot.

700
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:56,781
Mrs. McCanles wants to see you
up in the sitting room.

701
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,386
Maybe you better hurry.
She's been a-waiting.

702
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,226
I didn't know where you was...

703
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,596
so I said,
"I'll go see Mr. Lewton."

704
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,100
And he said...

705
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:07,227
Why are you so slow?

706
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,897
I don't rightly know...

707
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:12,169
exceptin' I always have
so much to remember.

708
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,108
This is the child, Jubal.

709
00:55:16,145 --> 00:55:19,273
Of course, she isn't dressed
quite properly, but...

710
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,782
Close the door, Pearl.

711
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,785
This is Mr. Crabby.

712
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,787
We have no minister
in these parts, but...

713
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,279
A man doesn't have to wear
the cloth to be a sinkiller.

714
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,792
I know that.
That's why I was so anxious...

715
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,795
to have you talk to the child.

716
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,319
Come here, girl.

717
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,803
You call her a child?

718
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,304
Under that heathen blanket...

719
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,306
there's
a full-blossomed woman...

720
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,831
built by the devil
to drive men crazy!

721
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,811
You mustn't frighten her.

722
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,508
I'm sure she only needs
a little guidance.

723
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:55,312
Guidance she needs,
and guidance she'll get...

724
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,319
or I ain't been the sinkiller...

725
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,821
from here to El Paso
for thirty years.

726
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,847
Sit down, girl.

727
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,828
You could be a woman of sin
or a woman of God.

728
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,831
Which is it to be?

729
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,833
I want to be a good girl.

730
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,767
Then remember that the devil's
always able to hog-tie you.

731
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,770
Sometimes he comes
ghosting over the plains...

732
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,772
in the shape
of a sneaking rustler...

733
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,274
and sometimes... begging
your pardon, Laura Belle...

734
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,775
he stakes out the home...

735
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,778
to the worthy
and the God-fearing.

736
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,781
You're curved
in the flesh of temptation.

737
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,283
Resisting is gonna be
a darn sight harder for you...

738
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:30,285
than for females protected
by the shape of sows.

739
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,787
Yes, sirree, bob, you've got to
sweeten yourself with prayer.

740
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,289
Pray till you sweat...

741
00:56:34,323 --> 00:56:36,291
and you'll save yourself
eternal hellfire.

742
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:39,021
- Do you understand me, girl?
- Yes, sir.

743
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,791
Then on your knees.

744
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,799
Now I'm gonna start you
toward salvation.

745
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:46,301
O Lord, look upon this,
thy creature.

746
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,803
She's a weak vessel
and a pauper, as thou knowest.

747
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,999
But she wants to be
thy handmaiden.

748
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,304
Give her the horse sense
not to go wandering off...

749
00:56:53,342 --> 00:56:55,674
in the tulies
with worthless cowpokes.

750
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,043
Amen.

751
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,316
Rise, girl.

752
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:04,683
Here. I want you to take this.

753
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,656
It's a hallowed medal,
and a good one.

754
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,817
I took it off
a thieving card sharper...

755
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:11,326
but first I shrived him...

756
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,260
and sent him
to the pearly gates...

757
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:16,265
as nice and pretty as any from
his own faith could have done.

758
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,267
You wear it, girl.

759
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,269
Thank you, sir.

760
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,271
Part Indian, ain't you?

761
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,773
Those ancestors of yours
will be spinning like tops...

762
00:57:24,807 --> 00:57:26,775
when they know you got this on.

763
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:28,777
Just the same, it'll keep you...

764
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:31,279
sweet and clean
as the first milking.

765
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,781
Won't get you into heaven...

766
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:35,283
but it will comfort you
on the way there.

767
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:37,309
That is, if you use it right.

768
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,290
Laura Belle, don't you think...

769
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:43,292
we ought to be saying
a few words of prayer...

770
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:45,294
for them worthless cowpokes?

771
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:49,287
I got a feeling
they'll be needing...

772
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,663
consolation.

773
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,327
On your knees again, girl.

774
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:59,808
O Lord, have mercy on all men,
young and old alike...

775
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:03,801
who gaze upon this,
thy regained servant.

776
00:58:03,846 --> 00:58:05,336
Amen.

777
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,759
Senator! Where's the Senator?

778
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,385
What's up?

779
00:58:18,427 --> 00:58:20,759
- Senator McCanles!
- What's the stampede?

780
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,924
There's a great big railway gang
down close to the east fence.

781
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:24,432
How close?

782
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,435
They say they're coming across
Spanish Bit line this afternoon.

783
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,767
- What will we do?
- Get ahold of Lewt and Jesse.

784
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:30,773
Lewt's not back from El Paso.

785
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:34,265
Holleration.
I guess Jesse and me...

786
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,278
can handle it all right.

787
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,780
- Sid.
- Yes, Senator?

788
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,783
Listen carefully now.

789
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,275
Sound every bell
from here to Blue Hills ranch.

790
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,778
I want every wrangler,
every cowhand...

791
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,793
every man and boy
on Spanish Bit...

792
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,820
down there at the east fence,
and I want them there fast.

793
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,456
- Yes, sir.
- And Sid.

794
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:59,297
- Yes, sir?
- I want them there armed.

795
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:00,893
You betcha.

796
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:58,290
I don't like this, Mr. Langford.

797
00:59:58,327 --> 01:00:00,295
It's your railroad,
and it's your headache...

798
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:02,661
but I still don't like it.

799
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:04,290
What do you mean,
you don't like it?

800
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:06,267
You told me we were legally
in the clear, didn't you?

801
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,793
Yeah, and I know you asked
the army for help, too.

802
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:11,807
And I hope they don't come.
And I hope we don't need them.

803
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,240
What do you mean?

804
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,245
I mean Jackson McCanles
don't scare so easy.

805
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:20,375
We roamed the plains together.
We fought at Vicksburg together.

806
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,748
And if he gives up
in this fight...

807
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,185
he ain't the man
I've known for fifty years.

808
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,246
I wish you wouldn't
try to ride, father.

809
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,258
You think I'm going
to sit in this house...

810
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,090
like some old woman?
Lift me on that horse.

811
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,790
If they want war,
they can have it.

812
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,924
- Ken.
- Yes, sir?

813
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,663
Strap me on here.

814
01:00:43,372 --> 01:00:45,306
Come on.

815
01:01:35,624 --> 01:01:39,253
I aim to defend
Spanish Bit with lead.

816
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:44,062
If there's any yellow-bellies
among you, get out now.

817
01:01:46,535 --> 01:01:48,560
Are you with me?

818
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,271
All right, then.
Spread out in a line...

819
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:56,278
from the west marker
to Pinto Point.

820
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,803
Come on!

821
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:30,227
Kind of thought he wouldn't
take this lying down.

822
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:32,763
Looks like they mean business.

823
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,181
Smoot!

824
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,815
Lem Smoot, I thought you had
more sense than this.

825
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,090
Yeah? Since when did you
ever know me to dodge a fight?

826
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,721
You know I'm lawyer
for the railroad...

827
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:57,630
Never mind that stuff.
Who's the dude?

828
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,430
Langford is the high
mucky-muck on the railway.

829
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,029
Heard a lot about you, Senator.
Glad to make your acquaintance.

830
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:06,041
Can't say the same,
thank you kindly.

831
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,270
You better tell those
hired thieves of yours...

832
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:10,107
to pick up their tools...

833
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:13,013
and fast, if you know
what's good for you.

834
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:14,538
We have the law on our side.

835
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,551
If you had come into court
when I asked you to...

836
01:04:16,585 --> 01:04:18,212
this land might not have been...

837
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:21,223
Never mind
that fancy legal talk.

838
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,158
There's my law right there.

839
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,232
Have you a copy
of the writ with you, Smoot?

840
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,734
What's the sense of...

841
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:34,565
All right. Are you our lawyer,
or aren't you?

842
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:37,470
- Now read it to him.
- Save your breath.

843
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,737
"From the people of
the sovereign state of Texas...

844
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,744
"to Jackson Tilt McCanles,
greetings."

845
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,905
"Greetings." Ain't that nice?

846
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,380
Jackson.

847
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,747
You and I fought to build
this state of Texas...

848
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,218
and I aim to see these men
perform their duties...

849
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,244
peacefully and as authorized.

850
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,257
Is that so?

851
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:58,920
I'm gonna shoot any trespasser
that comes on my property.

852
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:02,419
If you don't like that,
you can lump it...

853
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:03,931
you and the state of Texas.

854
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,764
Just a minute.
May I speak to you privately?

855
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:10,761
Say what you got to say
right here and now.

856
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:12,273
I'm sorry, father...

857
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,276
but I'm afraid
you're in the wrong.

858
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,437
I ain't aiming
to let you settle that.

859
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:18,173
You mean to shoot down
unarmed men?

860
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,775
Just like they was rattlesnakes
if they cross this line.

861
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,717
In that case, Senator...

862
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,795
Get me a pair of wire cutters.

863
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:34,921
Ferguson.

864
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,364
So that's where you stand.

865
01:05:37,399 --> 01:05:38,866
Think I'd rather be
on the side...

866
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:40,766
of the victims
than of the murderers.

867
01:05:45,307 --> 01:05:47,275
Jesse, I'm warning you.

868
01:05:47,309 --> 01:05:49,800
We're going to fire
on those coolies...

869
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,973
the moment you cut those wires.

870
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,949
Their blood will be
on your hands.

871
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:08,089
Jesse, I'm asking you
for the last time.

872
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:18,796
Column left. Ho!

873
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,876
Thank God.

874
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,316
Column left. Ho!

875
01:06:56,478 --> 01:06:59,345
Right front into lines. Ho!

876
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:43,291
I once fought for that flag.

877
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,316
I'll not fire on it.

878
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:55,792
Sid, tell those men
to get back to their work.

879
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,305
Yes, sir.

880
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:58,806
Father, l...

881
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,809
Get out of my sight...

882
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:04,904
and stay away from Spanish Bit
as long as I live.

883
01:08:05,305 --> 01:09:05,839
