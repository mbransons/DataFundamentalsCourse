1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,984
They're going mad, sir.
It's the students.

3
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:34,530
All right. Let them in.

4
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,329
- Swine!
- Beasts!

5
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,553
- Into the valley of death...
- Into the jaws of hell...

6
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:15,770
..rode the 600!

7
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,561
Hey, hey. Ease up.

8
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,188
You're sitting on my cloak.

9
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,484
- Something up down below?
- Not a sausage.

10
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:31,067
- Ah. Here you are, Terry.
- Thank you.

11
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:20,404
I can't see him anywhere.

12
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:22,487
- Programs.
- Oh. Two, please.

13
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,533
One here. Thanks, pal.

14
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,874
Quite a turnout down below.

15
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,961
Old Palmer's music
had better be good.

16
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:36,629
Boronskaja wouldn't dance
the leading role if it wasn't.

17
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:42,461
- Boro who?
- Who exactly is Boronskaja?

18
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:46,848
Since you've stood in a queue for
six hours waiting to see her dance...

19
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,638
Not to see anybody. To hear.

20
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,889
Have you ever heard
of Professor Palmer?

21
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,020
- Never.
- You will.

22
00:05:57,776 --> 00:06:01,476
The program says, "Heart Of Fire,
music by Andrew Palmer."

23
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:05,070
- Our professor.
- Boro-what's-her-name best be good.

24
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,905
She's hardly likely
to be anything else.

25
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,164
There he is. Palmer!

26
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:50,974
Livy!

27
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,739
Come on, Livy!

28
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,942
We know him.

29
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:01,830
Do you remember
my Cytherean Rhapsody?

30
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:04,542
- Forget it.
- That's it. Your rhapsody.

31
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:07,549
- It must be an accident.
- Did you show him?

32
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:10,588
- I show him all my work.
- You think he lifted it?

33
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,007
Shh!

34
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:19,642
She's a great patron of the arts.

35
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:36,157
Vicky. Vicky.

36
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,716
Vicky.

37
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:53,844
Lermontov's coming.

38
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:08,729
- I say! That's yours, too, isn't it?
- Yes.

39
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,373
Steady, old boy.

40
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:18,334
Well, what are you waiting for?

41
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,961
Shh!

42
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,005
Please, do you mind?

43
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:36,348
Oh, really!

44
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:52,395
Dear Professor, we're very proud of
you. I hope you're proud of yourself.

45
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,730
You're too kind. Monsieur Lermontov.

46
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,990
- We meet the great man at last.
- Enchanté, madame.

47
00:11:58,077 --> 00:12:01,077
I never imagined I'd succeed
in getting you here.

48
00:12:01,163 --> 00:12:03,239
I must be a very clever woman.

49
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:17,209
If some fat harridan
is going to sing, I must go.

50
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:20,919
- I can't bear amateurs.
- Neither can Lady Neston.

51
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:25,141
- What do you mean?
- She has a niece who dances.

52
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:26,505
Professionally.

53
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:34,263
Hello, Professor.

54
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:38,936
Now, please don't get up,
Mr Lermontov.

55
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:42,444
Now, are you prepared for a surprise?

56
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:45,366
Do you mean a surprise or a shock?

57
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:51,203
Well, to take the plunge,
I've asked my niece to dance tonight.

58
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:53,958
What would you call that?

59
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,204
A shock.

60
00:12:56,877 --> 00:13:00,577
Oh, well,
you're certainly very candid.

61
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:02,296
You know, Mr Lermontov,

62
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:06,793
I wouldn't dream of boring you
with the performance of an amateur.

63
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:10,668
My niece has been dancing leading
roles for some time now.

64
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:13,088
The critics think highly of her work.

65
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:17,048
How would you define ballet,
Lady Neston?

66
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:22,385
Well...one might call it
the poetry of motion, perhaps, or...

67
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:26,810
One might. But for me,
it is a great deal more.

68
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:29,392
For me, it is a religion.

69
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:31,526
And one doesn't really care

70
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:38,149
to see one's religion practised
in an atmosphere such as this.

71
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:40,284
I hope you understand.

72
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,575
Attractive brute.

73
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:26,655
- I'll have a champagne cocktail.
- Yes, sir.

74
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:30,028
- Champagne cocktail, please.
- Yes, madam.

75
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:37,787
Do you know at parties everybody
is supposed to be very happy?

76
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,333
But perhaps you dislike them
as much as I do.

77
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,753
Still, I think
it might have been worse.

78
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:51,627
- Do you?
- It very nearly was much worse.

79
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:53,880
- Oh?
- Thank you.

80
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:57,509
We were to be treated
to a little dancing exhibition.

81
00:14:57,602 --> 00:15:00,010
But now we're to be spared
that horror.

82
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:03,140
Mr Lermontov, I am that horror.

83
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,640
Mmm...

84
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,568
It's a bit late for apologies.

85
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:13,565
Yes, a little late, I think.

86
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:17,615
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

87
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:20,620
But you're not sorry
I didn't dance, are you?

88
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:23,706
- May I ask why?
- Because, my dear Miss...

89
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:24,870
Victoria Page.

90
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,876
Miss Page, if I accept
an invitation to a party,

91
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,630
I do not expect to find myself
at an audition.

92
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,256
Yes. You're quite right.

93
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:43,346
Why do you want to dance?

94
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:47,016
Why do you want to live?

95
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:53,313
Well, I don't know exactly why,
but, uh...I must.

96
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,398
That's my answer, too.

97
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:01,436
Come with me.

98
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:03,902
- Where to?
- We're going to talk.

99
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:07,691
- But I don't want to talk to you.
- Don't worry. I'll do the talking.

100
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:25,336
Can I see
Mr Lermontov now, please?

101
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:26,754
What is it, Dimitri?

102
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:30,461
A young man called Craster.
He's been here a hundred times.

103
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:33,639
I've told him you're asleep.
He will not believe me.

104
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:37,175
Either you're a bad liar
or he's a man of good sense.

105
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:39,594
Show him in and serve breakfast.

106
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,441
Mr Craster.

107
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:04,657
What can I do for you, Mr Craster?

108
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,371
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr Lermontov,

109
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:10,331
but it's a matter
of great importance to me.

110
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:11,880
Yes?

111
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,420
I wrote you a letter, a silly letter.

112
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:17,129
I'd like to have it back
before you read it.

113
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:20,089
I see.

114
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:25,391
That's the one.

115
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:30,850
Unfortunately, Mr Craster,
I have already read this letter.

116
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:32,349
Oh.

117
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:38,392
- Mr Lermontov, please.
- You are Professor Palmer's pupil?.

118
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:42,401
You say you've written a
string quartet and a piano concerto.

119
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,486
Yes.

120
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:46,444
Very interesting.

121
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:48,943
Would you care to play me something?

122
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:51,706
Something of your own, I mean.

123
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:55,038
Of course, if...if you wish it.

124
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:09,928
This is a study
I wrote for the piano.

125
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:16,633
But I'm thinking of orchestrating it

126
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:19,513
and putting it into an opera
I'm working on.

127
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,585
But are you finished already?
It was very interesting.

128
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,968
Hope I haven't ruined your breakfast.

129
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:04,428
By the way...

130
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:08,929
I need a new coach for the orchestra.
Would the idea interest you?

131
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:12,855
Would it...interest?

132
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:17,852
I shouldn't be able to pay much.
Ł8 a week and expenses.

133
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:22,361
It would be absolutely marvellous.

134
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:25,900
Get some breakfast
and come over to Covent Garden.

135
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:28,200
Thank you.

136
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:30,991
And your letter, Mr Craster.

137
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,784
If you take my advice...

138
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,128
you'll destroy it immediately
and forget about it.

139
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:49,719
The Heart Of Fire
is your work, isn't it?

140
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,886
These things happen unintentionally.

141
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,433
I know. That's why...

142
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:59,764
That's why it is worth remembering
that it is much more disheartening

143
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:01,894
to have to steal

144
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:05,184
than to be stolen from, hmm?

145
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:10,563
Good morning.

146
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:28,162
# As I walk the long,
cloudy, stormy night... #

147
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:38,049
# He went to Covent Garden
in the morning... #

148
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,335
What a corker.

149
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,391
Course I tried to get her.
Tried to get her twice. Ta-ra.

150
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,767
- Here you are, son.
- Thank you.

151
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,682
Hey, you'll pardon me.

152
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:55,015
This is the way to the stage,
isn't it?

153
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:57,018
- Name?
- Julian Craster.

154
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:59,898
- What name?
- Julian Craster.

155
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:01,151
Not on my list.

156
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:11,952
- Lunch, Irina?
- Yes.

157
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,831
But I have an appointment...

158
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:17,001
I'm sorry, but I've got my job
to look after.

159
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:20,205
- Good morning, George.
- Oh, bonjour, madame.

160
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:21,791
How is Madame George?

161
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:25,926
Oh, she's la trčs jalouse.
Very jalouse.

162
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,173
It's that bit of a photograph
we had took together. Cold drink?

163
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:33,715
They been looking all over London
for you this morning.

164
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,097
That's what I said.

165
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:37,845
How much longer must I wait?

166
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:40,392
- I'll send for the SM.
- What is your name?

167
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:43,185
Julian Craster.

168
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:46,311
I have an appointment
with Mr Lermontov.

169
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:48,525
Julian Kwis...Kweiss...

170
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:50,321
- Craster.
- Kwaster.

171
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:53,905
Well, George, if this young man
is invited by Mr Lermontov,

172
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:56,115
you can pass him, yes?

173
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:59,737
Ça va by me, madame. Ça va by me.

174
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:01,788
Follow me, young man.

175
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,701
- Est-ce que vous...?
- Comment?

176
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:08,957
Are you a dancer?

177
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:12,130
Yes...at night.
Not very much in the morning.

178
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:14,338
I don't know much about the ballet.

179
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:18,126
- You are artiste?
- Yes. I'm a composer.

180
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,340
Ah! And you wish to see who?

181
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:23,554
Well, I'm afraid I'm not quite sure.

182
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,595
They are all there. Take your choice.

183
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:37,357
Excuse me. Who's in charge?

184
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:40,232
There's five or six of them
that thinks they are.

185
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:43,608
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- Don't ask me.

186
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,657
I'm just somebody's mother.

187
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:49,243
That doesn't mean much around here,
I can tell you.

188
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,413
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- In charge of what?

189
00:22:56,503 --> 00:23:00,251
- Mr Lermontov asked me to come.
- Why?

190
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,091
- He's engaged me.
- Not as a dancer, I hope.

191
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,373
No.

192
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,959
Allons, mes enfants! Au boulot!

193
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,507
And...

194
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,590
Well, Mr Ratov,
Mr Ljubov wants it moved.

195
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:19,054
It is on the plan,
and there it stays.

196
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,222
Well, if you say so.

197
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:23,556
- Merci.
- Morning, madame.

198
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:32,401
Ah, here comes the great
Boronskaja at last.

199
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:35,906
And today she's only
43 minutes late.

200
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:39,658
Am I supposed to congratulate
myself on that?

201
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:44,619
I tell you, Irina,
my patience is at an end.

202
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,200
I shall go to Lermontov
and explain to him

203
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:50,829
how no theatre is big enough
to hold both you and me!

204
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:52,797
I might as well start packing.

205
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:57,046
Oh, there's no hurry. He might choose
to dispense with MY services.

206
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:58,631
He is quite crazy enough.

207
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:02,849
But if we go, we go together,
Grischa, darling. Promise?

208
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,392
Coo, Buschka.

209
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,603
- Who are you?
- Victoria Page.

210
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:11,439
I expect Mr Lermontov
has spoken about me.

211
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:14,228
- He's invited me here...
- No, this is too much.

212
00:24:14,318 --> 00:24:16,939
He invites them, I teach them.

213
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,566
I get rid of them, he forgets them.

214
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:21,529
And now, unhappy girl,

215
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:26,822
please go to the far corner of the
stage, where you'll meet five others

216
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:32,072
to whom Mr Lermontov has also
extended his hospitality.

217
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:45,965
Quiet, please!

218
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:52,216
I want to rehearse the first act
of Heart Of Fire.

219
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:55,723
Will everybody not concerned
leave the stage, please?

220
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:58,977
Right-o, boys,
set act one. Hurry.

221
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:06,567
Is that so? Well, I agree.

222
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:11,570
Where are you going, my dear?

223
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:13,863
I'm going to talk to Mr Lermontov.

224
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:17,533
Wouldn't it be better to wait
until after rehearsal?.

225
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:20,290
Oh, no. You see,
I know him personally.

226
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:23,907
Ah, well, that makes
all the difference. Of course.

227
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:26,159
- Ratov...
- Yes, Boris?

228
00:25:26,253 --> 00:25:28,874
Stay where you are. I'll come up.

229
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:41,719
- Good morning, Mr Lermontov.
- Good morning, Ratov.

230
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:45,223
We must do something
about this piece.

231
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,975
The girls have hardly room to move.
Ljubov was right.

232
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:51,519
- Aha! Ljubov...
- Ljubov is always right.

233
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:54,099
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.

234
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:58,569
Well, well, well. Then take it away.
Take it away.

235
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:08,537
Well, you see, my dear,
Mr Lermontov is a very busy man.

236
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:13,164
Now, why don't you go and wait
over there with the others?

237
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,539
Ivan! Are you ready?

238
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:17,002
Yes, I will.

239
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,412
- Sergei Sergeievitch?
- Yes?

240
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:23,254
Are you acquainted with the
works or person of Julian Craster,

241
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:24,920
composer and conductor?

242
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,049
- No.
- Nor I.

243
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:29,972
Which proves how sadly
we lag behind the times,

244
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,965
for here he is in our midst.

245
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,595
Lermontov has engaged him
this morning.

246
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:09,837
Rond de jambe... E.

247
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:34,269
Class dismissed.

248
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:10,426
No, gentlemen. Figure 29, sing.

249
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:14,429
I think that will do.

250
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,511
Thank you, gentlemen.

251
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:20,897
The brass could do with
your attention, Craster. Tomorrow.

252
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:39,076
Gentlemen, I'm very sorry to bring
you here so early.

253
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:44,163
But I've been in front
for this ballet more than once

254
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,710
and I really must...

255
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:52,965
There are one or two things
I really must put right.

256
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:56,715
So, um, Heart Of Fire.
Overture, please.

257
00:28:58,764 --> 00:29:00,803
From the beginning.

258
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,845
Oh, by the way, trumpets,
at two bars before figure two,

259
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:09,938
have you got an E natural?.

260
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:11,648
No. I've got an E flat.

261
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:15,351
Ah. Makes all the difference.
Should be E natural.

262
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,567
Right. From the beginning.

263
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:32,834
I know it's hard
to get your lips set this early,

264
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:35,325
but we ought to be able
to come in together.

265
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,539
Even more pianissimo. Less strings.

266
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,504
A, oboe.

267
00:29:47,763 --> 00:29:49,802
From the beginning, please.

268
00:30:18,205 --> 00:30:20,826
- That's nice.
- Mr Craster!

269
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:27,458
What is going on?
Have you taken leave of your senses?

270
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:32,172
Do you realise that by calling
the orchestra early we must pay them?

271
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:36,334
And why are you rehearsing
Heart Of Fire?

272
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:40,129
Did I ever ask you to do that?
Tell me. I'm interested.

273
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:43,474
I'm sure Mr Lermontov
will be interested, too.

274
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,974
- Well?.
- I like it.

275
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:53,188
You like it? You must also like the
National Anthem and the Marseillaise.

276
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:56,230
I hope you won't summon
the full orchestra at dawn

277
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,397
to practise those noble melodies?

278
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:02,273
I leave this young man to you,
Lermontov.

279
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:07,194
After all, he is your discovery,
not mine.

280
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:10,454
Mr Craster, I must ask you
to exercise in future

281
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,790
a little more control
over your natural ambitions.

282
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:18,372
And why you've chosen Heart Of Fire
for this early-morning escapade...

283
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:20,171
Good morning, gentlemen...

284
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:23,210
..is a mystery
I shall never hope to solve.

285
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:26,420
May I see that wrong note
in the score, please?

286
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:33,221
Hmm. However,
there are passages in Heart Of Fire

287
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,010
which no one need be ashamed of.

288
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,931
Thank you, Mr Lermontov.

289
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,991
- Good morning, Miss Page.
- Good morning, Edmund.

290
00:31:54,077 --> 00:31:56,615
- Is Lord Oldham with you?
- Yes, miss.

291
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:58,744
Be careful, miss.

292
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,913
- Good morning, Peter.
- Hello, Vicky.

293
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:05,243
- What are you doing here?
- What are you?

294
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:09,251
Having lunch with Boris Lermontov,
the fellow who runs the ballet.

295
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,092
- Oh. Business or pleasure?
- A bit of both.

296
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:14,049
Are you shopping or slumming?

297
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:18,299
Don't worry, Grischa.
I'll bring her back at three o'clock.

298
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:22,052
- How are you, madame?
- How are you?

299
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:25,261
Hello, Peter.
I hope we haven't kept you waiting.

300
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:26,728
No, not at all.

301
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:30,347
- Boris, meet my friend Vicky Page.
- How do you do?

302
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,274
Can we give you a lift anywhere?

303
00:32:35,361 --> 00:32:38,113
- No, thank you, Peter.
- Excuse me, Miss Page.

304
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:48,287
Who? Victoria Page?
yes, she may dance.

305
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:10,679
( # Swan Lake )

306
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,689
Good morning, my dear young ladies.

307
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:08,067
I hope I find you all very well.

308
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:11,240
There are one or two things
I would like to say.

309
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:14,528
As you know, the ballet's
leaving Saturday for Paris.

310
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,696
I can't imagine anything more
enchanting than inviting all of you,

311
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:22,957
but I'm afraid this pleasure
must be denied me.

312
00:35:23,043 --> 00:35:26,412
To those whom we must
regretfully leave behind,

313
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:30,418
I'd like to say just this -
please don't be discouraged.

314
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:35,003
The fact that we can't take you
doesn't mean that you're bad dancers.

315
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:38,096
It just means that
we haven't got enough room.

316
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:40,672
Please step out Miss Faye,
Miss Banes,

317
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:42,676
Miss Hardiman and Miss Laughlin.

318
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,605
Yes.

319
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:53,605
I thank you four ladies for
the hard work you've done this year.

320
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:57,229
- Mr Ljubov echoes my gratitude.
- Mmmm.

321
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:01,070
Maybe next year, we shall
meet you again. Good morning.

322
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,447
Vicky, he means us!

323
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:44,993
Listen... Mes amis...

324
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:48,823
I am fiancée. I get married!

325
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:52,539
My dear child!

326
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:56,754
All my love and best wishes
for your happiness.

327
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:08,755
I wish you the greatest happiness
with your new partner.

328
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,383
- Merci. Grischa? Where is Grischa?
- I'm here, Irina!

329
00:38:12,477 --> 00:38:14,137
Darling, do you hate me?

330
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:18,936
I could never hate you, Irina,
but how can I ever forgive you?

331
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:21,147
You will forgive me, that I know.

332
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:24,400
Don't quarrel with your husband
as much as me.

333
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:28,270
Where is Boris Lermontov?
He has nothing to say to me?

334
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,825
Boris!

335
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:39,196
He has...no heart, that man.

336
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,688
Entrez!

337
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,286
- Mr Craster, I have a job for you.
- Good!

338
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:31,163
Do I understand you have not been
altogether very happy with us so far?

339
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:33,824
- Well, I...
- Well, what?

340
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,297
Coaching an orchestra is not exactly
a young composer's dream, is it?

341
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:43,209
I'm afraid the job I have may not be
a young composer's dream, either.

342
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:48,260
Still, I hope you do not consider it
entirely unworthy of your talent.

343
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:57,805
The ballet of The Red Shoes is from
a fairy tale by Hans Andersen...

344
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:05,482
..pair of red shoes.

345
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,109
Oh, I beg your pardon?

346
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:17,240
The ballet of The Red Shoes is from
a fairy tale by Hans Andersen.

347
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:21,375
It is the story of a girl
who is devoured by an ambition

348
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:24,413
to attend a dance
in a pair of red shoes.

349
00:40:24,504 --> 00:40:26,911
She gets the shoes, goes to the dance

350
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:29,164
and at first, she's very happy.

351
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:35,960
At the end of the evening,
she gets tired and wants to go home.

352
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,556
But the red shoes...

353
00:40:41,643 --> 00:40:44,050
are not tired.

354
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:47,229
In fact, the red shoes
are never tired.

355
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:52,688
They dance her out into the streets,
over the mountains and valleys,

356
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:56,442
through fields and forests,
through night and day.

357
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:02,694
Time rushes by. Love rushes by.

358
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:06,243
Life rushes by.

359
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,957
But the red shoes...dance on.

360
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:13,368
What happens in the end?

361
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:16,249
- In the end, she dies.
- Yes. I remember.

362
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,296
The music is by Felipe Beltran.

363
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:22,130
He did it for us last year
during our South American tour.

364
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:26,511
You'll find some passages marked with
a blue pencil. They are bad.

365
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:31,305
I would like to see what you can do
in the way of a little rewriting.

366
00:41:31,393 --> 00:41:34,097
- Oh.
- You can take your time.

367
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:36,144
- There's no hurry.
- Thank you.

368
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,472
- On vous attend.

369
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:40,724
Oui, je viens.

370
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:42,228
Thank you.

371
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:32,357
Ah, look at our Boronskaja.
She's in wonderful form tonight.

372
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:35,777
I'm not interested in Boronskaja's
form any more.

373
00:42:35,863 --> 00:42:39,563
Nor with any prima ballerina
imbecile enough to get married.

374
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:43,157
- Oh, come now, Boris.
- She's out. Finished.

375
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,614
You cannot have it both ways.

376
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,707
The dancer who relies upon the
doubtful comforts of human love...

377
00:42:56,422 --> 00:42:59,376
will never be a great dancer.

378
00:42:59,466 --> 00:43:00,925
Never!

379
00:43:11,143 --> 00:43:15,970
That is all very pure and fine,
but you can't alter human nature.

380
00:43:16,064 --> 00:43:19,397
No? I think you can do
even better than that.

381
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:20,859
You can ignore it.

382
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:50,709
Boris!

383
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,296
Adieu.

384
00:43:55,638 --> 00:43:57,262
Well, Irina,

385
00:43:57,348 --> 00:44:01,096
now you'll be able to sleep
as long as you like

386
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:06,012
and eat sweets all day
and go to parties every night.

387
00:44:06,105 --> 00:44:09,355
And you, now you will be calm.

388
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:11,350
The class will start on time.

389
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:15,986
No more shouting. No more
hysteria backstage. No more...

390
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:18,064
No more...Irina.

391
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:44,170
Oh, Monsieur Lermontov!

392
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:57,309
Miss Page.

393
00:44:59,984 --> 00:45:03,898
- Are you very tired?
- Yes, thank you.

394
00:45:03,988 --> 00:45:05,648
I mean, I'm not very tired.

395
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:08,609
Monsieur, je vous présente
Miss Victoria Page.

396
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,399
Monsieur Boudin,
le directeur général de l'opéra.

397
00:45:12,494 --> 00:45:16,242
- Monsieur Rideaut.
- Enchanté, mademoiselle.

398
00:45:16,331 --> 00:45:20,873
You have already visited Monte Carlo,
mademoiselle?

399
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,751
Yes, I was here last season.

400
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:27,296
- Then you know the Hôtel de Paris.
- Yes, but I believe I'm staying...

401
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:30,584
Hôtel de Paris.
You'll be very comfortable.

402
00:45:45,772 --> 00:45:49,639
La voiture de Monsieur Lermontov
vous attend, Miss Page.

403
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,900
Bon soir, mademoiselle.

404
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:06,165
Montez, mademoiselle.

405
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:25,106
You look dressed up
for a conference.

406
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:27,355
Hello. Is there a conference on?

407
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,533
Yes. They're all arguing.
I've been here since seven.

408
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:33,202
There you are, Miss Page.

409
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:35,114
Will you come in here, please?

410
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:49,759
I was just going out, Mr Lermontov,
when I got your message.

411
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:00,719
Miss Page...

412
00:49:01,894 --> 00:49:06,639
I've asked you to come here tonight
because we're preparing a new ballet,

413
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:10,182
and I've decided
to give you a chance

414
00:49:10,276 --> 00:49:13,312
and let you dance
the principal part in it.

415
00:49:13,404 --> 00:49:16,855
But there's one thing
I must tell you at once.

416
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:21,409
My belief in your possibilities
is not shared by my colleagues here.

417
00:49:24,538 --> 00:49:27,907
However, it is hardly
necessary for me to add

418
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,621
that whatever their personal belief,

419
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:32,999
they will all give you their best.

420
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:35,792
The rest, of course, is up to you.

421
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:39,249
Well, Miss Page...that's all.

422
00:49:40,385 --> 00:49:43,255
We shall start work
early tomorrow morning.

423
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:47,213
I suggest you forget all about
your party and go home to bed.

424
00:49:48,225 --> 00:49:50,052
Yes, I will.

425
00:49:54,814 --> 00:49:56,853
And Miss Page?

426
00:49:59,193 --> 00:50:01,944
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

427
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:09,115
Well, what happened?

428
00:50:10,327 --> 00:50:13,743
- I've got a part in a new ballet.
- New? What ballet?

429
00:50:15,123 --> 00:50:17,448
The Red Shoes!

430
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:22,708
Now, listen to this. It's impossible.

431
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,253
Well, I couldn't rewrite
that bit, could I?

432
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:29,878
- Why not?
- You didn't blue-pencil it.

433
00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:32,755
Horrors like that
speak for themselves.

434
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:35,383
In fact, I had some ideas about that.

435
00:50:35,473 --> 00:50:38,259
Where are they, dear fellow?
We need a score!

436
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,307
If you'll allow me.

437
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:46,229
Well, it's the church scene.

438
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:50,608
Get rid of this sentimental hymn
and take a four-square chorale.

439
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:52,520
Something like this.

440
00:50:59,952 --> 00:51:04,079
Then I thought all the way through,
a church bell coming in.

441
00:51:14,214 --> 00:51:17,214
All this on the strings.

442
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,418
Then as the priest appears,
the brass.

443
00:51:31,812 --> 00:51:34,765
Shall I play you
The Dance of the Red Shoes?

444
00:51:41,236 --> 00:51:43,940
Thank you, Mr Craster. Thank you.

445
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:51,365
I want you to change everything.
I want a new score.

446
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:55,155
There you are, Mr Lermontov.

447
00:51:56,082 --> 00:51:58,407
And where's the orchestration?

448
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,908
- When do you want it?
- Yesterday.

449
00:52:01,003 --> 00:52:03,161
You wanted to work. Go home and work.

450
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:05,710
I don't want to see you
till it's done.

451
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:07,707
You won't!

452
00:52:31,737 --> 00:52:33,813
Why aren't you in bed?

453
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:37,440
- Oh, you gave me quite a fright.
- I meant to.

454
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,862
Why aren't you in bed?

455
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:47,822
I was much too excited to sleep,
so here I am.

456
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:50,538
- Are you? I haven't seen you.
- Thank you.

457
00:52:50,628 --> 00:52:53,034
By the way,
you haven't seen me, either.

458
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:56,628
- Has he sent you to bed, too?
- No.

459
00:52:56,715 --> 00:53:00,962
I'm just working on the score
of my new ballet, The Red Shoes.

460
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,879
Is that my ballet, too?

461
00:53:04,013 --> 00:53:05,638
Yes, I suppose it is.

462
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:25,481
I wonder what it feels like
to wake up in the morning

463
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:27,115
and find oneself famous.

464
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,113
You're not likely to know
if you stay here talking much longer.

465
00:53:31,203 --> 00:53:34,903
- So, good luck.
- Good luck.

466
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:28,246
She's putting too much into it.

467
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:30,575
Why don't you tell her, Grischa?

468
00:54:30,669 --> 00:54:32,412
Mind your own business.

469
00:54:33,547 --> 00:54:37,330
She has the dance with me and
the dance at the fair earlier.

470
00:54:37,425 --> 00:54:41,636
And the big stuff coming up.
She can't dance everything full out.

471
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,420
- She ought to know that.
- How do you expect her to know it,

472
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,718
if you never danced full out
before opening night?

473
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:58,143
Here are the designs
for the costumes, Boris.

474
00:54:58,234 --> 00:55:00,855
One moment.
Sit down, will you, please?

475
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:07,898
I'm so sorry. Something
has to be done about the music.

476
00:55:07,993 --> 00:55:10,151
She starts the pirouette early.

477
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:14,242
- The tempo's wrong. It's too fast.
- It's the right tempo.

478
00:55:14,331 --> 00:55:17,000
Of course. Once more.

479
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:27,710
- She'll be all right.
- I hope so.

480
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,876
Still unconverted, Sergei?

481
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:33,835
Well, of course
she's a charming girl, but...

482
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,219
I know nothing about her charms.

483
00:55:36,307 --> 00:55:40,470
But they won't wait till the end,
they'll applaud in the middle!

484
00:55:41,478 --> 00:55:44,681
- Come now.
- Sergei, I'll take a bet.

485
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:46,397
Oh, enough. Enough.

486
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:53,229
Miss Page, we are trying to create
something of beauty.

487
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:56,358
While you wave your arms
like a scarecrow

488
00:55:56,449 --> 00:55:59,154
and bend your knees
like an old cart horse,

489
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:01,152
we are unlikely to succeed.

490
00:56:05,332 --> 00:56:07,953
Well, well...it's a bet.

491
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:11,285
Come, let me see your sketches.

492
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:15,416
The girl.

493
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:56,239
You still think I can do it?

494
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,330
Well, at the moment, you look as if
you find it difficult.

495
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:04,417
But when we open in two weeks,
I hope it'll be supremely simple.

496
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:09,633
Don't forget,
the great impression of simplicity

497
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:13,337
can only be achieved by a great agony
of body and spirit.

498
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,763
Voilŕ.

499
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,053
You don't want to ruin
your breathing, do you?

500
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,308
From today,
you'll lunch in my office.

501
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:25,809
Craster.

502
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:35,188
Will you sit over there, please?

503
00:57:35,282 --> 00:57:37,405
Merci. Mr Craster, the piano.

504
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:40,943
Do you usually have musical
accompaniment to your meals?

505
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:42,579
No, Miss Page, I do not.

506
00:57:42,664 --> 00:57:46,114
I'm afraid this is your fate
for the next two weeks.

507
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:49,411
Mr Craster is going to play
The Red Shoes music

508
00:57:49,503 --> 00:57:53,203
at every lunch, tea and dinner
you take until we open.

509
00:57:53,298 --> 00:57:55,089
I see.

510
00:57:55,174 --> 00:58:00,048
Yes. In this way, you should become
quite familiar with the music.

511
00:58:00,136 --> 00:58:02,211
Yes, I think I probably shall.

512
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:05,803
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.

513
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:07,800
- Mr Craster.
- Certainly.

514
00:58:07,892 --> 00:58:09,766
Bon appétit.

515
00:58:13,397 --> 00:58:15,638
ŕ votre service, mademoiselle.

516
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,987
Some composers specialise in
lunchtime music, don't they?

517
00:58:23,072 --> 00:58:27,069
- Some.
- You?

518
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:28,736
In my time.

519
00:58:35,749 --> 00:58:37,991
Do you mind not playing that?

520
00:58:39,711 --> 00:58:41,170
It's the right tempo.

521
00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:44,711
Let's take the ballroom scene.

522
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,132
That's the most digestible
part of the score.

523
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:50,092
The ballroom's been cut.

524
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:55,764
Cut as a scene, but it's still there
in my score.

525
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,008
I wrote this dance for a ballroom.

526
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:02,846
Anyone who understands anything
about music will see a ballroom.

527
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:13,941
Even Lermontov will see a ballroom.

528
00:59:14,032 --> 00:59:15,442
Even you.

529
00:59:16,576 --> 00:59:20,157
And when you're lifted
into the air by your partner,

530
00:59:20,244 --> 00:59:22,201
my music will transform you.

531
00:59:22,288 --> 00:59:23,746
Into what?

532
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:28,916
A flower...swaying in the wind.

533
00:59:30,795 --> 00:59:33,286
A cloud...drifting in the sky.

534
00:59:34,423 --> 00:59:36,914
A white bird...flying.

535
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:38,586
Tell that to Ratov.

536
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:42,424
He would love
your birds and flowers.

537
00:59:42,513 --> 00:59:43,711
You don't?

538
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:47,424
- If you were a dancer, you'd know...
- Just a minute.

539
00:59:47,518 --> 00:59:50,186
# Nothing matters but the music #

540
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:53,105
It's hard enough
to get off the ground anyway

541
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,146
without being a bird or flower.

542
00:59:59,653 --> 01:00:02,606
Won't you imagine anything
on the first night?

543
01:00:05,866 --> 01:00:08,784
Yes, a wall between me
and the audience.

544
01:00:21,046 --> 01:00:23,453
My music will pull you through it.

545
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:58,655
Hee-haw!

546
01:00:58,744 --> 01:01:02,112
Miss Page, I'm not a circus conductor
and you're not a horse.

547
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:03,319
It's too fast.

548
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:07,663
You would not find it too fast

549
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:11,748
if you'd let the slow passage end
before you start your pirouette.

550
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:14,459
My downbeat marks a pause.

551
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:16,956
We understand it,
don't we, gentlemen?

552
01:01:17,051 --> 01:01:20,751
- You come in on the second beat.
- Impossible!

553
01:01:20,846 --> 01:01:22,968
One, two, tia, tia!

554
01:01:23,056 --> 01:01:25,843
It's quite simple.
You see this baton?

555
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,506
- Yes.
- Well, follow it!

556
01:02:09,803 --> 01:02:11,427
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

557
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:15,638
Vicky. Vicky!

558
01:02:15,725 --> 01:02:18,298
Dance whatever tempo you like.
I'll follow you.

559
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:24,390
All right, Ivan?

560
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:26,060
Time to go down, Craster.

561
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,893
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

562
01:02:27,985 --> 01:02:30,440
- Nervous?
- No.

563
01:02:40,204 --> 01:02:42,280
Do I...?

564
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:44,365
What the devil have you
got to worry about?

565
01:02:44,457 --> 01:02:48,786
It's a fine score.
A magnificent score. I only wish I...

566
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:50,870
Go on.

567
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:33,952
- Grischa.
- It's chaos, chaos, chaos!

568
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,875
- Grischa...
- Ah, Boris.

569
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:40,666
- Mon dieu! The red shoes.
- What?

570
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:43,755
The red shoes are not there!

571
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,749
- Rideaut.
- Monsieur.

572
01:03:47,635 --> 01:03:48,833
Where are they?

573
01:03:48,928 --> 01:03:52,343
- You haven't hidden them yourself?
- No, no, no!

574
01:03:52,431 --> 01:03:54,756
Yes! Fou! Fou!

575
01:04:04,358 --> 01:04:06,516
Boris, look here.

576
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,269
Elephants.

577
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:11,278
Clumsy elephants
have ruined my decor.

578
01:04:11,364 --> 01:04:14,779
- Calm yourself.
- The door! The door! It won't shut.

579
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:17,238
- Somebody must hold it.
- But who?

580
01:04:17,327 --> 01:04:20,280
The call boy.
He'll have nothing to do.

581
01:04:20,371 --> 01:04:24,618
- Dimitri.
- Give it to me. Hold the door.

582
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:28,656
- Best of luck, Miss Page.
- I can't remember my entrance.

583
01:04:28,752 --> 01:04:32,500
You think you can't.
What about this?

584
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:36,204
That's it. It's all right
when I hear the music.

585
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,087
Since you undoubtedly
will hear the music,

586
01:04:39,178 --> 01:04:41,799
it's undoubtedly
going to be all right.

587
01:04:41,888 --> 01:04:45,506
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.

588
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,600
If I had any doubts
about you, I'd be nervous.

589
01:04:48,686 --> 01:04:50,512
- Am I nervous?
- No.

590
01:04:50,604 --> 01:04:52,893
You're not dancing for an audience.

591
01:04:52,981 --> 01:04:55,686
You're dancing for
Ljubov, Ratov, myself,

592
01:04:55,775 --> 01:04:58,527
people you've danced for
many times before.

593
01:04:58,611 --> 01:05:01,528
I believed in you
from the very beginning.

594
01:05:01,614 --> 01:05:04,104
But now everybody does.

595
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:10,402
Dance tonight with the same ecstasy
I've seen in you only once before.

596
01:05:10,496 --> 01:05:11,990
At the Mercury Theatre?

597
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,994
Yes, at the Mercury Theatre
in London...

598
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:17,958
on a wet Saturday afternoon.

599
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:19,918
- 40 seconds.
- Coming.

600
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:24,252
Good luck, my dear.

601
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:28,919
You're the magician, to have produced
this in three weeks from nothing.

602
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,633
A magician can't produce
a rabbit from a hat

603
01:05:31,722 --> 01:05:34,295
if there isn't already
a rabbit in the hat.

604
01:05:55,283 --> 01:05:58,616
It's a pity the theatre
only holds 300.

605
01:05:58,703 --> 01:06:01,952
We could have filled
the Albert Hall tonight!

606
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:06,036
But what we're creating tonight,
the world will talk of tomorrow.

607
01:06:09,629 --> 01:06:11,039
Good boy.

608
01:06:12,256 --> 01:06:13,584
Rideau.

609
01:23:39,006 --> 01:23:41,840
Ça va? Any swelling?

610
01:23:41,925 --> 01:23:43,632
I mean the head.

611
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:46,469
All that clapping, bravos, roses...

612
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,261
Puh! All that's nothing.

613
01:23:48,347 --> 01:23:52,640
But when I,
who have seen Pavlova dance,

614
01:23:52,725 --> 01:23:55,596
tell you that last night
you were not bad...

615
01:23:55,686 --> 01:23:57,809
not good, but not bad...

616
01:23:57,896 --> 01:23:59,972
that's something.

617
01:24:03,234 --> 01:24:04,894
Now I tell you truth.

618
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:07,062
It was...

619
01:24:07,154 --> 01:24:09,443
- good.
- Thank you, Mr Ljubov.

620
01:24:09,531 --> 01:24:12,781
- My name is Grischa.
- Mine is Vicky.

621
01:24:12,868 --> 01:24:15,536
How do you do?

622
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:18,620
Arm straighter. So...

623
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:20,912
Boris Lermontov wants to see you.

624
01:24:20,999 --> 01:24:23,324
Why in the class time? Why?

625
01:24:54,073 --> 01:24:56,066
Silence!

626
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:59,158
- Fifth.
- Bras.

627
01:25:02,329 --> 01:25:05,081
Hello? Hello? Yes.
Who is it? Oh, it's you!

628
01:25:05,165 --> 01:25:07,122
Monsieur Lermontov...

629
01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:10,162
No, no. It's fine.
Thank you for ringing me.

630
01:25:10,253 --> 01:25:12,578
You're not disturbing me at all.

631
01:25:12,671 --> 01:25:15,542
I always have time
for congratulations.

632
01:25:19,344 --> 01:25:22,463
- Oh, yes. I agree.
- Monsieur Lermontov...

633
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:26,219
A most distinguished score.

634
01:25:26,308 --> 01:25:30,175
- Voilŕ, Monsieur Craster.
- Uh, Monsieur Craster?

635
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:33,270
Yes.
Of course he'll contact me.

636
01:25:33,356 --> 01:25:34,766
Yes, he's going to.

637
01:25:34,857 --> 01:25:38,475
He's starting with a new ballet,
full of gait and charm.

638
01:25:38,568 --> 01:25:41,141
La Belle Meuničre,
book by Marcel Lucien.

639
01:25:41,237 --> 01:25:42,518
Go away.

640
01:25:42,614 --> 01:25:45,697
Yes. Oh, yes,
it's a wonderful role for her.

641
01:25:45,783 --> 01:25:48,700
- Au revoir, Lermontov.
- Au revoir, madame.

642
01:25:48,785 --> 01:25:50,694
No, not this season. Next season.

643
01:25:53,873 --> 01:25:55,201
Merci beaucoup.

644
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:57,864
Yes. It was very kind
of you to ring me.

645
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,335
Thank you very much.

646
01:25:59,419 --> 01:26:02,290
No more calls,
not even congratulations.

647
01:26:04,716 --> 01:26:07,087
Au revoir. Where are those papers?

648
01:26:07,176 --> 01:26:08,967
Thank you very much. Here.

649
01:26:11,054 --> 01:26:12,596
Excusez-moi.

650
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:15,764
Well, Mr Craster, that's all.
I'm proud of you.

651
01:26:15,849 --> 01:26:19,977
- Mr Lermontov, I would like to...
- Some other time...ah, yes!

652
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:21,804
- Do you read French?
- Yes.

653
01:26:21,896 --> 01:26:25,478
Well, read it.
We'll talk about it some other time.

654
01:26:27,901 --> 01:26:29,858
Mademoiselle Page.

655
01:26:29,944 --> 01:26:33,894
Come in, Miss Page, come in.
Sit down.

656
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:37,156
I want to talk to you
about your future.

657
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:40,989
When we first met,

658
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:45,290
you asked me a question to which
I gave a stupid answer.

659
01:26:45,374 --> 01:26:48,825
You asked me whether
I wanted to live and I said yes.

660
01:26:48,919 --> 01:26:51,706
Actually, I want more, much more!

661
01:26:51,796 --> 01:26:52,994
I want to create,

662
01:26:53,089 --> 01:26:56,671
to make something big
out of something little...

663
01:26:56,759 --> 01:26:59,878
to make a great dancer out of you.

664
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:03,173
But first, I must ask you
the same question.

665
01:27:03,264 --> 01:27:05,173
What do you want from life?

666
01:27:06,309 --> 01:27:07,886
- To live?
- To dance.

667
01:27:15,608 --> 01:27:19,059
We have two months left of the season
in Monte Carlo.

668
01:27:19,153 --> 01:27:21,857
Not much time,
but enough, two months.

669
01:27:21,947 --> 01:27:26,692
Then we go on tour - Rome, Vienna,
Copenhagen, Stuttgart, then America.

670
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:28,907
Then next year, London again.

671
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:31,069
All the big parts for you...

672
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:35,373
Coppelia, Lac des Cygnes, Gisčle,
Les Sylphides, La Boutique...

673
01:27:35,457 --> 01:27:37,248
We create them all first with you.

674
01:27:37,334 --> 01:27:39,291
You shall dance...

675
01:27:39,377 --> 01:27:41,085
and the world shall follow.

676
01:27:41,171 --> 01:27:43,246
You... Shh!

677
01:27:43,339 --> 01:27:45,497
Not a word.

678
01:27:45,591 --> 01:27:48,129
I will do the talking.

679
01:27:48,218 --> 01:27:50,543
You...

680
01:27:50,637 --> 01:27:52,345
will do the dancing.

681
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,339
( # La Boutique Fantasque )

682
01:28:18,035 --> 01:28:19,659
Ah, Victoria Page.

683
01:28:22,998 --> 01:28:25,488
- Good night, Boris.
- Night, Grischa.

684
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:28,288
- She was not bad tonight.
- She'll be all right.

685
01:28:28,377 --> 01:28:32,955
All right! Not bad!
But she's a flame!

686
01:28:34,799 --> 01:28:38,843
- Still la-di-da? Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

687
01:28:38,928 --> 01:28:45,808
Vicky was wonderful in Boutique,
just a little Dresden shepherdess.

688
01:28:45,892 --> 01:28:48,346
We should reconstruct the theatre.

689
01:28:48,435 --> 01:28:51,056
- What's wrong with it?
- It's too small!

690
01:28:51,146 --> 01:28:53,932
- Good night, Lermontov.
- Good night, Livy.

691
01:28:54,023 --> 01:28:57,356
- Her timing's a miracle.
- Keep her up to it.

692
01:28:57,443 --> 01:28:59,601
( # Coppelia )

693
01:29:56,368 --> 01:29:59,404
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Grischa.

694
01:30:00,788 --> 01:30:04,073
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

695
01:30:05,124 --> 01:30:08,409
- Good night, Mr Lermontov.
- Good night, Vicky.

696
01:31:04,174 --> 01:31:08,088
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

697
01:31:08,178 --> 01:31:11,095
Uh, thank you,
Monsieur Boudin. That's all.

698
01:31:12,223 --> 01:31:14,796
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Grischa.

699
01:31:14,892 --> 01:31:17,014
- Boudin.
- Oui?

700
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:20,102
Which is the very best restaurant
on the coast?

701
01:31:20,188 --> 01:31:22,309
- La Resserre.
- Oui, La Resserre.

702
01:31:22,397 --> 01:31:25,516
- Good night, Lermontov.
- Good night, Livy.

703
01:31:26,609 --> 01:31:28,518
Book me a table.

704
01:31:30,863 --> 01:31:34,361
- For...two?
- Yes.

705
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,235
Au revoir.

706
01:31:38,327 --> 01:31:40,035
- Julian.
- Yes?

707
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,528
I never said good night to Lermontov.

708
01:31:42,623 --> 01:31:46,536
Monsieur Dimitri?
No, Miss Page has still not come in.

709
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:50,125
Monsieur Ratov? Uh, not yet, either.

710
01:31:50,212 --> 01:31:53,545
Monsieur Ljubov? 317... No.

711
01:31:55,925 --> 01:31:58,594
Ah, Monsieur Dimitri, I've just heard

712
01:31:58,678 --> 01:32:03,138
they've all gone to supper
at the Old Port with Monsieur Ljubov.

713
01:32:03,223 --> 01:32:04,682
His birthday!

714
01:32:56,684 --> 01:33:00,219
Class! Class! Un gateau.

715
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:11,564
Ah, merci.

716
01:33:18,953 --> 01:33:20,578
Boris Lermontov!

717
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,993
Greetings, Grischa.

718
01:33:27,085 --> 01:33:29,042
Am I permitted
to join your party?

719
01:33:29,129 --> 01:33:32,462
Get me a chair!
What a pleasure, Boris.

720
01:33:32,548 --> 01:33:34,505
A chair for Boris Lermontov!

721
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:38,920
Two chairs for Boris Lermontov!
Make way there. A throne.

722
01:33:39,012 --> 01:33:41,467
A throne for the great Boris.
Take mine.

723
01:33:41,556 --> 01:33:42,884
No, no, take mine.

724
01:33:42,974 --> 01:33:45,595
No, you sit down.
It's your birthday.

725
01:33:46,727 --> 01:33:47,925
Well...

726
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:52,348
seems a long time since I sat down
to supper with my entire family.

727
01:34:05,867 --> 01:34:11,027
But it appears that the great
Miss Page is not with us tonight.

728
01:34:11,122 --> 01:34:15,166
Don't you miss another member
of our happy little family?

729
01:34:17,377 --> 01:34:20,128
No...no. I can't say I do.

730
01:34:20,213 --> 01:34:24,589
Why should you? You're a busy man.
Have a drink, Lermontov!

731
01:34:26,718 --> 01:34:29,256
Grischa. Ta santé.

732
01:34:29,345 --> 01:34:33,045
Of course we all know
you're a busy man, Boris Lermontov,

733
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:36,224
but do you mean to tell me
you have noticed nothing?

734
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:38,979
Don't exaggerate.

735
01:34:39,062 --> 01:34:42,596
Boris, we have a little romance
in our midst.

736
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:44,232
A great romance!

737
01:34:44,316 --> 01:34:48,693
- Romeo Craster.
- And Juliet...Page.

738
01:34:50,947 --> 01:34:54,481
And when...
did this great romance begin?

739
01:34:54,575 --> 01:34:57,148
With the Red Shoes.

740
01:34:59,663 --> 01:35:01,572
Charming.

741
01:35:01,664 --> 01:35:04,700
And where have they
taken themselves tonight?

742
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:08,492
What does it matter
where they've gone?

743
01:35:08,587 --> 01:35:12,999
They are young, they are together
and they are in love.

744
01:35:44,325 --> 01:35:47,278
Darling.

745
01:35:47,369 --> 01:35:50,572
I've decided I do believe in destiny
after all.

746
01:35:50,663 --> 01:35:54,281
Do you, my darling? I'm very glad.

747
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,750
Cocher.

748
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:08,671
Cocher!

749
01:36:14,475 --> 01:36:15,756
You'll wake him.

750
01:36:15,851 --> 01:36:19,018
But I want to know where we are.

751
01:36:20,355 --> 01:36:22,182
Cocher? Co...

752
01:36:35,951 --> 01:36:38,987
One day, when I'm old,

753
01:36:39,079 --> 01:36:42,245
I want some lovely young girl
to say to me...

754
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:49,875
"Tell me, where in your long life,
Mr Craster, were you most happy?"

755
01:36:51,214 --> 01:36:52,756
And I shall say...

756
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:57,466
"Well, my dear, I never knew
the exact place.

757
01:36:57,553 --> 01:37:01,253
"It was somewhere
on the Mediterranean.

758
01:37:01,347 --> 01:37:03,755
"I was with Victoria Page."

759
01:37:04,892 --> 01:37:10,099
"What?" she will say.
"Do you mean the famous dancer?"

760
01:37:10,188 --> 01:37:15,644
And I will nod, "Yes, my dear, I do.

761
01:37:15,735 --> 01:37:22,697
"But then, she was quite young,
comparatively unspoiled.

762
01:37:22,782 --> 01:37:28,321
"We were, I remember,
very much in love."

763

( # Swan Lake )

764
01:38:10,822 --> 01:38:12,779
Did you see that?

765
01:38:12,865 --> 01:38:15,024
She smiled at Craster.

766
01:38:15,117 --> 01:38:16,362
I don't think so.

767
01:38:16,452 --> 01:38:19,986
I suppose you will be sending me
to an oculist next.

768
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:25,708
Watch her dancing.

769
01:38:26,877 --> 01:38:28,751
With pleasure.

770
01:38:30,297 --> 01:38:34,080
Debutantes...at a charity matinée.

771
01:38:42,432 --> 01:38:45,516
Yes. Yes!

772
01:38:46,894 --> 01:38:49,219
Yes. All right. Thursday.

773
01:38:49,313 --> 01:38:51,222
Good evening, Mr Lermontov.

774
01:38:51,315 --> 01:38:54,351
I'm afraid the score's
still a bit rough,

775
01:38:54,442 --> 01:38:56,814
but I see you had
time to look at it.

776
01:38:56,903 --> 01:38:58,942
Yes, Mr Craster.

777
01:39:00,322 --> 01:39:01,982
I have looked at it.

778
01:39:04,533 --> 01:39:09,195
However, it's not about your music
that I wish to talk at the moment.

779
01:39:09,287 --> 01:39:11,612
So to come to the point...

780
01:39:11,706 --> 01:39:14,991
What is all this I hear
about you and Miss Page?

781
01:39:15,084 --> 01:39:16,957
Oh, I see.

782
01:39:18,087 --> 01:39:20,660
- Could Dimitri...?
- Get out.

783
01:39:20,755 --> 01:39:23,590
Well, Mr Craster?

784
01:39:28,387 --> 01:39:29,964
Yes. We're in love.

785
01:39:32,515 --> 01:39:34,508
I see.

786
01:39:35,935 --> 01:39:39,220
Did you see Miss Page's performance
in Lac des Cygnes?

787
01:39:39,313 --> 01:39:41,056
I was conducting.

788
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:42,393
Did you enjoy it?

789
01:39:42,482 --> 01:39:45,234
It was the loveliest thing
I've ever seen.

790
01:39:45,318 --> 01:39:47,476
It was impossible.

791
01:39:48,612 --> 01:39:51,364
And you know why it was impossible?

792
01:39:51,448 --> 01:39:55,113
Because neither her mind nor her
heart were in her work.

793
01:39:55,201 --> 01:39:57,822
She was...dreaming.

794
01:39:57,912 --> 01:40:02,241
And dreaming is a luxury
I've never permitted in my company.

795
01:40:02,332 --> 01:40:04,704
Miss Page wants to be a great dancer.

796
01:40:04,793 --> 01:40:07,959
Perhaps she has spoken to you
about her ambitions.

797
01:40:08,046 --> 01:40:09,243
Oh, yes.

798
01:40:09,338 --> 01:40:12,707
She's not, however,
a great dancer yet.

799
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,709
Nor is she likely to become one

800
01:40:14,801 --> 01:40:20,043
if she allows herself to be
sidetracked by idiotic flirtations.

801
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,304
Mr Lermontov, you...don't understand.

802
01:40:24,433 --> 01:40:26,473
We really are in love.

803
01:40:32,732 --> 01:40:37,643
And, Mr Craster, I have had time
to look at your latest effort...

804
01:40:37,736 --> 01:40:38,851
Yes?

805
01:40:38,946 --> 01:40:41,271
..and find it equally impossible.

806
01:40:52,624 --> 01:40:55,827
That's not true. It's good.

807
01:40:55,919 --> 01:40:57,958
Childish...

808
01:40:58,045 --> 01:41:00,797
vulgar...
and completely insignificant.

809
01:41:01,965 --> 01:41:05,001
In that case,
I'll relieve you of it.

810
01:41:05,093 --> 01:41:08,426
There are so many
first-class ballet companies

811
01:41:08,513 --> 01:41:11,299
to which you may
take it with advantage.

812
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:13,513
Ballet work is not my great ambition.

813
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,060
Some of us think it's rather
a second-rate means of expression.

814
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:26,978
- 'Oui, Monsieur Lermontov?'
- Mr Craster is leaving the company.

815
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:30,485
Pay him two weeks' salary
and get the receipt.

816
01:41:59,972 --> 01:42:01,680
Oh, hello, Boris.

817
01:42:01,765 --> 01:42:04,516
- I was coming to say good night.
- Good night.

818
01:42:04,601 --> 01:42:06,677
- Is anything the matter?
- No, no.

819
01:42:06,769 --> 01:42:10,897
And before I forget, don't do any
more work on the new ballet.

820
01:42:10,981 --> 01:42:14,516
- I decided to scrap it.
- Scrap it? What do you mean?

821
01:42:14,609 --> 01:42:17,526
I worked out
half the choreography already.

822
01:42:17,612 --> 01:42:20,103
That boy Julian is really gifted.

823
01:42:20,197 --> 01:42:22,522
It's one of our finest scores.

824
01:42:22,616 --> 01:42:27,573
Julian Craster is leaving and
I don't wish to discuss it further.

825
01:42:27,662 --> 01:42:30,331
Oh, you don't? Well, I do!

826
01:42:30,414 --> 01:42:34,542
Do you think I don't know
a brilliant score when I hear one?

827
01:42:34,626 --> 01:42:37,543
Do you think I've been
working day and night

828
01:42:37,671 --> 01:42:41,798
for the pleasure of being told
I am wasting my time?

829
01:42:41,883 --> 01:42:48,762
I tell you, Boris, I've had enough
of this lunatic asylum!

830
01:42:48,847 --> 01:42:51,219
I am through with it!

831
01:42:51,307 --> 01:42:53,216
I resign!

832
01:42:54,435 --> 01:42:57,683
I think you've made
a very important decision.

833
01:43:11,573 --> 01:43:15,571
Hello, you two. Isn't love wonderful?.

834
01:43:19,288 --> 01:43:21,660
Bonsoir, Julian.

835
01:43:21,749 --> 01:43:23,373
Hello.

836
01:43:28,463 --> 01:43:30,289
Well, what did he say?

837
01:43:30,381 --> 01:43:35,007
Ah. Of course he doesn't really
want you to go, Grischa.

838
01:43:35,093 --> 01:43:36,422
He is very sorry.

839
01:43:36,511 --> 01:43:39,962
Well, in that case,
I will think about it.

840
01:43:40,056 --> 01:43:41,466
What about Julian?

841
01:43:41,557 --> 01:43:47,345
I have never seen him
quite as bad as this.

842
01:43:47,437 --> 01:43:53,688
He talked a great deal about
ingratitude and...disloyalty.

843
01:43:53,776 --> 01:43:57,643
And he said when personal relations
start to interfere...

844
01:43:57,738 --> 01:43:59,529
Yes, I know that bit.

845
01:44:00,698 --> 01:44:04,742
My dear children, I'm very sorry.

846
01:44:06,787 --> 01:44:09,823
Boris might feel different
in the morning.

847
01:44:09,915 --> 01:44:14,824
The morning? He's leaving for Paris
by the 8.15 train.

848
01:44:44,735 --> 01:44:47,522
Has the famous Miss Page
come to see me off?

849
01:44:48,988 --> 01:44:50,897
I'd like to talk to you.

850
01:45:00,915 --> 01:45:04,331
I want to know
why you quarrelled with Julian.

851
01:45:04,418 --> 01:45:08,498
May I suggest that such matters
are hardly your business?

852
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:13,875
However, since you've gone to
all this trouble...

853
01:45:16,178 --> 01:45:20,721
Mr Craster has been unwise enough
to interfere with plans of mine.

854
01:45:20,807 --> 01:45:23,594
And that is something
I do not permit.

855
01:45:25,728 --> 01:45:29,261
I thought once that
there would be no room in my life

856
01:45:29,355 --> 01:45:32,059
for anything but dancing.

857
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:34,225
You'll think so again, my dear.

858
01:45:34,318 --> 01:45:36,773
But if Julian goes, I shall go, too.

859
01:45:39,822 --> 01:45:41,898
And what do you intend to do?

860
01:45:41,991 --> 01:45:43,734
I shall dance somewhere else.

861
01:45:43,826 --> 01:45:45,948
Oh, yes.

862
01:45:46,036 --> 01:45:49,903
That won't be very difficult
with the name I've given you.

863
01:45:49,998 --> 01:45:53,580
Always provided I release you
of your contract.

864
01:45:54,752 --> 01:45:59,709
But even if I do,
would it be quite the same?

865
01:46:01,174 --> 01:46:03,545
I have never pretended it would.

866
01:46:06,845 --> 01:46:12,633
I could make you one of the greatest
dancers the world has ever known.

867
01:46:15,478 --> 01:46:19,973
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I do.

868
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:24,481
And all that means nothing to you?

869
01:46:26,695 --> 01:46:29,447
You know exactly
what it means to me.

870
01:46:34,911 --> 01:46:37,282
The train is leaving!

871
01:46:38,789 --> 01:46:40,366
Goodbye, Mr Lermontov.

872
01:46:47,003 --> 01:46:49,494
Miss Page is coming!

873
01:46:57,095 --> 01:47:00,962
Julian! Julian!

874
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:05,058
I'm coming with you!

875
01:47:05,144 --> 01:47:07,599
Hooray!

876
01:48:03,859 --> 01:48:05,483
The fool.

877
01:48:08,196 --> 01:48:09,820
The fool.

878
01:48:12,658 --> 01:48:14,366
No!

879
01:48:53,902 --> 01:48:56,475
Come in. You are late.

880
01:48:56,571 --> 01:48:58,693
I hope you didn't work too hard.

881
01:48:58,781 --> 01:49:02,149
All finished.
I have the injunction with me.

882
01:49:32,892 --> 01:49:36,592
Boris, don't tell me you've
changed your mind again.

883
01:49:42,108 --> 01:49:46,520
I...I don't want to stop her
doing anything.

884
01:49:47,655 --> 01:49:52,992
She can dance when and where
she likes...except the Red Shoes.

885
01:49:53,076 --> 01:49:55,863
- What about the boy?
- That's different.

886
01:49:55,953 --> 01:49:59,120
Everything written under contract
to me is mine.

887
01:49:59,206 --> 01:50:02,906
The Red Shoes and his work so far
on La Belle Meuničre.

888
01:50:03,001 --> 01:50:05,788
I'm not interested in
anything else he writes.

889
01:50:05,878 --> 01:50:09,543
If you do The Red Shoes,
you'll have to pay him royalties.

890
01:50:09,632 --> 01:50:12,549
Red Shoes is no longer
in the repertoire!

891
01:50:12,634 --> 01:50:14,009
Oh.

892
01:50:22,101 --> 01:50:25,136
I understand Patrick Trevellyan
is in Paris.

893
01:50:26,312 --> 01:50:27,688
Yes.

894
01:50:27,772 --> 01:50:29,895
I dined with them both last night.

895
01:50:29,982 --> 01:50:32,271
Oh?

896
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:35,609
- Boronskaja was with him?
- Yes.

897
01:50:36,946 --> 01:50:38,274
Anything I can do?

898
01:50:38,363 --> 01:50:40,688
How's their marriage? Success?

899
01:50:40,782 --> 01:50:43,273
Patrick seems to think so.

900
01:50:43,368 --> 01:50:46,902
Would you like me to arrange
a meeting with Irina?

901
01:50:48,330 --> 01:50:50,121
Not arrange.

902
01:50:51,541 --> 01:50:53,368
By chance.

903
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:25,438
Oh! Boris!

904
01:51:30,366 --> 01:51:32,405
( # Les Sylphides )

905
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:00,799
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Irina.

906
01:52:02,684 --> 01:52:06,384
- Good season.
- With the Ballet Lermontov, always.

907
01:52:07,938 --> 01:52:11,022
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

908
01:52:11,108 --> 01:52:12,353
- Sergei!
- Yes?

909
01:52:12,442 --> 01:52:16,356
- Would you wait a minute, please?
- Yes, of course, Boris.

910
01:52:20,616 --> 01:52:24,150
- Good night, Boris!
- Grischa, please come in and wait.

911
01:52:25,412 --> 01:52:28,994
Oh...a conference.

912
01:52:30,749 --> 01:52:33,157
- Ah!
- Uh!

913
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:39,004
Letters.

914
01:52:40,132 --> 01:52:43,964
- Nobody writes to me.
- That's not true.

915
01:52:44,052 --> 01:52:46,460
Yours...from Vicky.

916
01:52:46,554 --> 01:52:49,092
From Vicky?

917
01:52:49,182 --> 01:52:51,803
- How is that girl?.
- Read it. You'll see.

918
01:52:52,935 --> 01:52:55,011
And this is from Julian.

919
01:52:55,103 --> 01:52:57,060
It's all about his new opera.

920
01:52:58,356 --> 01:53:04,974
It describes the whole structure.
Enormous talent, that boy.

921
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:09,948
He says...

922
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:13,363
"She is an inspiration.

923
01:53:15,453 --> 01:53:16,828
"A miracle."

924
01:53:16,913 --> 01:53:20,495
- Thank you, Mr Boudin. That's all.
- Merci. Bonsoir.

925
01:53:20,582 --> 01:53:23,749
Well...I see it's mail day.

926
01:53:23,835 --> 01:53:26,373
From our two young rebels.

927
01:53:26,462 --> 01:53:30,376
Deserters. I hope they're happy.

928
01:53:30,466 --> 01:53:33,550
- Read, Boris.
- Yes. Read this, too.

929
01:53:33,635 --> 01:53:37,169
It might make you sorry
to have lost that young man.

930
01:53:37,263 --> 01:53:39,302
I doubt it.

931
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:40,849
That reminds me...

932
01:53:40,933 --> 01:53:44,764
Jacques sent me
the new score of La Belle Meuničre.

933
01:53:44,853 --> 01:53:47,770
I like it.
I'd like you all to hear it at once.

934
01:53:47,856 --> 01:53:49,978
We might open with it in London.

935
01:53:50,066 --> 01:53:52,936
- With Irina?
- We can discuss that.

936
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:56,148
Lights, all gaiety, fire.

937
01:53:56,238 --> 01:54:00,401
Be good enough to glance through it.
And no prejudice, please.

938
01:54:00,491 --> 01:54:03,196
I hope you say that
to yourself sometimes.

939
01:54:03,285 --> 01:54:04,993
Every day. Good night.

940
01:54:05,078 --> 01:54:06,987
- Good night.
- Good night.

941
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:10,698
On second thought, I think
I would like to read those letters.

942
01:54:18,048 --> 01:54:22,045
My letter was only meant
to be read by me.

943
01:54:22,135 --> 01:54:24,044
See you later, Boris.

944
01:54:24,136 --> 01:54:25,465
Good night, Sergei.

945
01:54:34,644 --> 01:54:37,764
I could hardly let him read it.

946
01:54:37,855 --> 01:54:40,393
She calls him a monster...

947
01:54:40,483 --> 01:54:43,269
a gifted, cruel monster.

948
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,399
You should have told him that.

949
01:59:13,753 --> 01:59:17,537
I...I am sorry to be late,
Boris Lermontov.

950
01:59:22,677 --> 01:59:25,215
Lady Neston was in front tonight.

951
01:59:26,347 --> 01:59:29,965
She arrived this morning.
She is staying for several weeks.

952
01:59:31,101 --> 01:59:34,885
And Miss Page is joining her
next week for a short holiday.

953
02:00:06,505 --> 02:00:10,289
We seem destined to meet
at railway stations.

954
02:00:10,384 --> 02:00:15,259
- What are you doing in Cannes?
- Waiting for you. Won't you sit?

955
02:00:22,769 --> 02:00:24,678
But you know, my dear Vicky,

956
02:00:24,771 --> 02:00:27,688
how I'm always looking
for great dancers.

957
02:00:34,487 --> 02:00:36,112
We all have missed you.

958
02:00:36,197 --> 02:00:40,360
And I was hoping that by now
you would have started to miss us...

959
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:42,028
a little.

960
02:00:42,119 --> 02:00:43,945
I have.

961
02:00:45,121 --> 02:00:47,659
You only have to say the words.

962
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:52,828
- How is everybody?
- Never better.

963
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:56,418
- How is Grischa?
- Always fighting with Boronskaja.

964
02:00:56,505 --> 02:00:59,292
- And she?
- Always fighting with Grischa.

965
02:00:59,383 --> 02:01:01,126
- Sergei?
- Getting younger.

966
02:01:01,217 --> 02:01:03,922
- And you?
- Getting older.

967
02:01:04,011 --> 02:01:06,502
And you? You are happy?

968
02:01:06,597 --> 02:01:08,720
Yes. Very happy.

969
02:01:09,808 --> 02:01:11,931
As a dancer, I mean.

970
02:01:13,228 --> 02:01:15,434
I haven't danced much, you know.

971
02:01:15,521 --> 02:01:16,801
Oh, I know.

972
02:01:16,897 --> 02:01:19,566
I know every time you have danced.

973
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:22,105
- But you never stopped working?
- No.

974
02:01:22,194 --> 02:01:25,894
- You never stopped going to class?
- Never.

975
02:01:27,365 --> 02:01:29,653
And why isn't he with you?

976
02:01:29,742 --> 02:01:32,446
His opera's been accepted
at Covent Garden.

977
02:01:32,536 --> 02:01:34,030
It's in rehearsal now.

978
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:37,370
- Would he give it up if you asked?
- I don't know.

979
02:01:37,457 --> 02:01:39,330
- You do.
- I wouldn't ask.

980
02:01:39,417 --> 02:01:44,541
Then why is he asking you?
Does he know what he is asking?

981
02:01:51,552 --> 02:01:56,711
We are preparing a new ballet.
We've been working for weeks.

982
02:01:56,806 --> 02:02:01,514
The costumes and the decor are the
most beautiful Ratov has ever done.

983
02:02:01,602 --> 02:02:05,729
Grischa's full of enthusiasm.
Do you know what that means?

984
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:15,228
Nobody else has ever danced
The Red Shoes since you left.

985
02:02:16,697 --> 02:02:18,736
Nobody else ever shall.

986
02:02:21,493 --> 02:02:23,984
Put on the red shoes, Vicky...

987
02:02:24,078 --> 02:02:26,747
and dance for us again.

988
02:02:35,505 --> 02:02:37,663
'This is the BBC Third Program.

989
02:02:37,757 --> 02:02:41,339
'I am at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London.

990
02:02:41,427 --> 02:02:45,340
'Tonight is the first night
of Cupid and Psyche,

991

998
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:12,533
'Ladies and gentlemen,

has been suddenly taken ill.

1001

'Sir Hartley Menzies
will conduct in his place.'

1002
02:03:25,506 --> 02:03:28,291
'Here comes Sir Hartley Menzies now.'

1003
02:03:28,382 --> 02:03:31,715
'I'll announce the cast
at the interval.'

1004
02:03:45,939 --> 02:03:50,399
All the way down from London,
I wondered if I'd find you here.

1005
02:03:50,484 --> 02:03:52,192
And here you are.

1006
02:03:52,277 --> 02:03:57,188
- So you left your first night?
- Yes.

1007
02:03:57,282 --> 02:03:59,274
Oh, Julian.

1008
02:04:00,409 --> 02:04:02,318
Why didn't you?

1009
02:04:07,874 --> 02:04:11,325
This is all that matters.

1010
02:04:12,461 --> 02:04:15,296
All right, love, my sweetheart.

1011
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:19,247
There's a train to Paris at 8.00.
We'll be on it together.

1012
02:04:20,343 --> 02:04:22,252
Better hurry and get changed.

1013
02:04:22,345 --> 02:04:24,633
- But I'm dancing tonight.
- Walk out.

1014
02:04:26,306 --> 02:04:28,097
Good evening, Mr Craster.

1015
02:04:28,183 --> 02:04:31,267
Won't they be missing you
at Covent Garden?

1016
02:04:33,312 --> 02:04:35,103
Leave me alone, both of you!

1017
02:04:35,189 --> 02:04:38,557
Please, Julian,
wait until after the performance.

1018
02:04:38,650 --> 02:04:40,144
it'll be too late then.

1019
02:04:40,235 --> 02:04:44,776
You're already too late, Mr Craster.
Tell him why you've left him.

1020
02:04:44,863 --> 02:04:46,736
- I haven't left him!
- Oh, yes.

1021
02:04:46,823 --> 02:04:49,609
Nobody can have two lives -
yours is dancing.

1022
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:53,448
Vicky, you can dance anywhere else
in the whole world.

1023
02:04:53,537 --> 02:04:56,621
Would you be satisfied
with less than the best?

1024
02:04:56,706 --> 02:04:58,829
If so, you'd never be a great artist.

1025
02:04:58,916 --> 02:05:01,786
Would you make her
a great dancer as well?.

1026
02:05:01,877 --> 02:05:03,075
Never!

1027
02:05:03,170 --> 02:05:08,709
Why do you think I've waited so long
for a chance to win her back?

1028
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:11,421
- Because you're jealous of her.
- Yes!

1029
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:15,128
I am...but in a way that
you will never understand.

1030
02:05:17,849 --> 02:05:19,426
Wait!

1031
02:05:24,813 --> 02:05:26,355
Well, Vicky?

1032
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:30,223
I love you, Julian! Nobody but you!

1033
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:34,821
But you love that more.

1034
02:05:35,989 --> 02:05:38,860
I don't know! I don't know.

1035
02:05:40,535 --> 02:05:44,366
If you go with him now,
I will never take you back. Never!

1036
02:05:44,455 --> 02:05:47,823
Vicky, do you want to
destroy our love?

1037
02:05:47,916 --> 02:05:49,992
Adolescent nonsense!

1038
02:05:50,085 --> 02:05:53,998
All right. Go, then. Go with him.

1039
02:05:54,088 --> 02:05:59,508
Be a faithful housewife
with a crowd of screaming children!

1040
02:05:59,593 --> 02:06:01,917
Finish with dancing forever!

1041
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:04,133
Vicky...look at me.

1042
02:06:23,487 --> 02:06:26,025
Goodbye, then, my darling.

1043
02:06:29,701 --> 02:06:31,243
Julian.

1044
02:06:35,122 --> 02:06:37,826
Peut-on commencer l'ouverture?

1045
02:06:37,916 --> 02:06:41,000
- Oui. Commencez.
- Bon. Bon. Bon.

1046
02:06:41,461 --> 02:06:44,663
Alors, commencez toute de suite.
Vite! Vite!

1047
02:06:44,755 --> 02:06:46,214
Vicky...

1048
02:06:47,549 --> 02:06:52,839
Vicky. Little Vicky.

1049
02:06:55,014 --> 02:06:58,382
There it is, all waiting for you.

1050
02:06:58,475 --> 02:07:02,306
The sorrow will pass, believe me.

1051
02:07:02,395 --> 02:07:05,764
Life is so unimportant.

1052
02:07:07,316 --> 02:07:11,693
And from now onwards,
you will dance...

1053
02:07:12,821 --> 02:07:15,027
like nobody ever before.

1054
02:07:52,061 --> 02:07:53,472
Mon petit.

1055
02:07:56,565 --> 02:07:59,768
Mon petit! Ah! Monsieur Lermontov!

1056
02:08:09,451 --> 02:08:11,823
Mademoiselle Page!

1057
02:09:21,511 --> 02:09:26,089
Ladies...and gentlemen!

1058
02:09:30,102 --> 02:09:34,680
I'm sorry...to tell you...

1059
02:09:37,149 --> 02:09:41,526
that Miss Page...is unable...

1060
02:09:43,071 --> 02:09:46,237
to dance...tonight...

1061
02:09:48,993 --> 02:09:51,032
Nor indeed...

1062
02:09:53,204 --> 02:09:54,449
any other nights.

1063
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:04,040
Nevertheless...we've decided...

1064
02:10:07,508 --> 02:10:11,920
to present...The Red Shoes!

1065
02:10:17,141 --> 02:10:19,180
It...is...

1066
02:10:20,393 --> 02:10:22,018
the ballet...

1067
02:10:25,022 --> 02:10:26,896
that made her name...

1068
02:10:29,151 --> 02:10:33,065
whose name...she made.

1069
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:37,358
We...present it...

1070
02:10:40,494 --> 02:10:47,077
because...we think...

1071
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:51,954
she would have...

1072
02:10:53,755 --> 02:10:56,424
wished it.

1073
02:11:32,746 --> 02:11:34,026
Pas d'espoir.

1074
02:11:43,296 --> 02:11:45,585
Julian?

1075
02:11:45,673 --> 02:11:47,712
Yes, my darling?

1076
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,836
Take off the red shoes.

1077
02:11:51,305 --> 02:12:51,621
