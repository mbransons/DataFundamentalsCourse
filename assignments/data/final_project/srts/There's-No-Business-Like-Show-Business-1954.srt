you would not go far #

7

rusty-haired conductor man #

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,520
# I got to find that man #

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,760
# I'll grab him
by the collar #

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
- # Ala... #

you stop your train #

26

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,720
Stop!

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,120
# In days of yore
before the war #

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,520
# When hearts now old
were young #

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,760
# At home each night
by firelight #

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,960
# Those dear old songs
were sung #

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,680
# Sweet melodies
and memories #

49
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,920
# Around my heart
still cling #

50
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,440
# That's why I like
to hear a song #

51
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,240
# Like mother
used to sing #

52
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,400
# Won't you play
a simple melody #

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,280
# Like my mother
sang to me? #

54
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,520
# One with good
old-fashioned harmony #

55
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,520
# Play a simple melody #

56
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
# Musical demon #

57
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,920
# Sets your honey
a-dreamin' #

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,320
# Won't you
play me some rag? #

59
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
# Just change that
classical nag #

60
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,520
# To some sweet
beautiful drag #

61
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,840
# If you will
play from the copy #

62
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,120
# Of a tune
that is choppy #

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
# You'll get
all my applause #

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,040
# And that is
simply because #

65
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,440
# I want to listen to rag #

66
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
# A... #

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,040
# Musical demon #

68
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,480
# Sets your honey
a-dreamin' #

69
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,400
# But won't you
play me some rag? #

70
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,240
# Just change that
classical nag #

71
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,000
# To some sweet

72
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,240
# If you will play

73
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,840
# Of a tune
that is choppy #

74
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,600
# You'll get all
my applause #

75
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,320
# And that is
simply because #

76
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,080
# I want to hear
some ragtime music #

77
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,640
# That's what
you want to hear #

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,200
# A sweet song with
a sigh and a tear #

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,080
# A good old
ragtime simple melody #

80
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
"Peter Rabbit was a very bad
little rabbit,

81
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,400
"and that's why
Peter Rabbit

82
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,840
"was sent to bed
without his supper.

83
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
"But Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Cotton-Tail,

84
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,360
they had ice cream
and raspberry jam."

85
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
They say it's late.

86
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,880
How late?

87
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,360
I don't know.

88
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,800
They just said
it was late.

89
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,240
Well, I know that.

90
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,680
You didn't have to go
all the way over there

91
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
to find that out.

92
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,560
Don't yell at me, Molly.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't run the railroad.

94
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,280
Wake me up when
the train gets here.

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,400
Terry.

96
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,520
Already?

97
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,440
No. No. Terry,
this is a crummy way

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
to bring up kids.

99
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh, Molly, don't start
sending the kids

100
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,760
back to your mother

101
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,200
just because
the train is late.

102
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,640
Steve ought to go
to school,

103
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
and they should be
sleeping in beds

104
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
instead of--oh,
it's just not right

105
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,440
keeping them up all hours
of the night like this.

106
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,880
I want them to have
an education,

107
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,320
a real education.

108
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
They have to learn
arithmetic and spelling

109
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,880
and geography.

110
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,160
You never went past
the sixth grade.

111
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,600
It was probably
the fourth grade

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
because you said
it was the sixth.

113
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,480
My age is the only thing
I lie about,

114
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,920
and I don't add on,
I take off.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
All right,
the sixth grade,

116
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,320
but there's
nothing wrong

117
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
with your arithmetic.

118
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,560
<i>You can whistle
Mandy</i>

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,680
<i>doing
Off To Buffalo</i>

120
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,000
and count the house
at the same time

121
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,080
and tell me
within 5 cents

122
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,200
how much is
out there.

123
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,480
That's not arithmetic.

124
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,760
Darn right that's not.

125
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,040
That's higher mathematics.

126
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,480
Besides,
the welfare workers

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,400
are going
to crack down on us

128
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,680
wherever we go, just like
they did in Pittsburgh.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,120
I handled it there,
didn't I?

130
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,560
Why don't you let me
worry about that?

131
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,280
Oh, quiet. You'll
wake up the children.

132
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
Oh, Father dear,

133
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,480
will you see if there's
a dry diaper for the baby

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,920
in that basket?

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
Diaper. Is that
the kind of thing

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,480
you mention in public?

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,600
Sometimes.

138
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
Don't bother. He hasn't
worn them for two years.

139
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,440
You know, if there was
any way to divide up

140
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,560
three children evenly...

141
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes?

142
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>P.A. Announcement:
The Western track two.</i>

143
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,840
All aboard for Scranton.

144
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,720
Come on, joy boy.
That's our train.

145
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,160
Come on, darling,
wake up.

146
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,600
Wake up. Come on.
We have to go.

147
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,040
You get these two,
will you?

148
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,480
And that big one.

149
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
I can handle
the rest of them.

150
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,840
Here, honey,
you take this one.

151
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,280
Take good care
of it now.

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,240
Help with the luggage now.

153
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,640
Steve, ask your father

154
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
if he remembered
to change my berth

155
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,200
to a lower.

156
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,640
Katy, ask Pop
if he remembered

157
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,920
to make the change.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
How about the change,
Daddy?

159
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
I got plenty of change.

160
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,240
I'll take care
of the porter.

161
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,680
He says he's got it.

162
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
He got the lower, Mom.

163
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,560
Good. If there's
one thing I hate,

164
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,000
it's sleeping
in an upper berth

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,440
with three kids.

166
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,560
Come on, honey.

167
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
Here's Flopsy.

168
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,560
Here's Mopsy.

169
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
And you've got
Cotton-Tail.

170
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,240
And you, too,
Peter Rabbit.

171
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,720
Wait till you see our finish.

172
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
Terry yelled
his head off, of course.

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,160
He still wanted to keep them
on the road with us,

174
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
but as the children
grew older,

175
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,520
I finally won out.

176
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,400
We put them in a very good
school in Boston.

177
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,840
Poor kids.

178
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,240
And that meant we had
to figure out a new act.

179
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
You sure had
a brilliant idea

180
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
for that little gem.

181
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,840
I sure did:

182
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
Eight
beautiful blondes.

183
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,400
Nine.

184
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,520
Nine?

185
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,840
Yes, nine.

186
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,000
# A pretty girl #

187
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,160
# Is like a melody #

188
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:46,000
# That haunts you
night and day #

189
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,680
# Just like the strain #

190
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,880
# Of a haunting refrain #

191
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,560
# She'll start upon
a marathon #

192
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,080
# And run around
your brain #

193
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,160
# You can't escape #

194
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,520
# She's in your memory #

195
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,480
# By morning, night,
and noon #

196
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,440
# She will leave you
and then #

197
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,400
# Come back again #

198
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,720
# A pretty girl is just
like a pretty tune #

199
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
# A pretty girl #

200
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,520
# La ta da
ta da de da #

201
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
# Is like a melody #

202
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,320
# La ta da
ta da de da #

203
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,640
# That haunts you
night and day #

204
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,720
# They go together
like sunny weather #

205
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
# Goes with
the month of May #

206
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
# Just like the strain #

207
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,360
# La la la la la la-- #

208
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,240
# Of a haunting refrain #

209
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,000
# She'll start upon
a marathon #

210
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,920
# And run around
your brain #

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,640
# You can't escape,
no, no, no, no, n-- #

212
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,520
# She's in your memory #

213
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:13,000
# In your memory by
morning, night, and noon #

214
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,000
# She will leave you
and then... #

215
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,840
# Come back again #

216
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,760
# A pretty girl is
just like a pretty tune #

217
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,080
Terrence was
having so much fun

218
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,920
that I hated to spoil it,

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,800
but Saturday night,
that was the end of that.

220
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,440
It was good-bye, blondes.

221
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,880
Shh!

222
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,160
Tim, we ought
to go back.

223
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,080
We're just going to get
in a lot of trouble.

224
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,520
Katy's waiting for us
out in the bushes.

225
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,880
You're not going to go
chicken now, are you?

226
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Come on!

227
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Going somewhere?

228
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,120
Suppose you come
in here, boys.

229
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,880
What is it?

230
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,000
Trouble.

231
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,120
Where?

232
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
School.

233
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,600
I don't want you
to think that the children

234
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,080
have caused
any serious trouble.

235
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,000
On the contrary,
they're fine youngsters,

236
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,400
and we'd like
to keep them very much.

237
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,880
I just thought it best

238
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,280
that we have
a little talk.

239
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,760
I hope my telegram
didn't interfere

240
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,160
too much
with your plans.

241
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,120
That's all right, Father.
We closed last night.

242
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,040
We'll be laying off
for Lent anyway.

243
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,480
Oh, isn't that
interesting?

244
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
I didn't know actors

245
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,360
gave up the theater
for Lent.

246
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,760
Well, not exactly, Father.

247
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,720
Let's say that the theater
gives up actors for Lent.

248
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,160
Does the box office
fall off?

249
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,040
Yes, Father. Ours falls off.
Yours picks up.

250
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,440
Oh, I understand,

251
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,920
but to return
to the children.

252
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,840
The fact is, they want
to be back with you.

253
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,240
Did they tell you that?

254
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,720
Well, they've
done more than that.

255
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,640
They tried
to run away. Twice.

256
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,720
No.

257
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,840
Yes.

258
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,320
Why? Is the work
too much for them?

259
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,720
I mean,
are they dumbbells?

260
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,200
Oh, no.
Not at all.

261
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,120
If there's something
wrong with our kids,

262
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,040
you don't have
to horse around. You can...

263
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,560
Oh, I beg your pardon,
Father.

264
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,920
That's quite all right.

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,360
No, there's nothing
wrong with them.

266
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,800
Quite the contrary.

267
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,240
Steve is a fine student,

268
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
quiet, serious.

269
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
Quite an unusual boy.

270
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,720
Katherine, well,
the sisters tell me

271
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,920
she's above average.

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,320
And, uh, Timothy?

273
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,440
Well, uh...

274
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,320
Timothy is all boy,
shall we say?

275
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,760
A natural born leader.

276
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
Great kid, huh, Father?

277
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,320
Unfortunately,

278
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,760
sometimes he leads
the others

279
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,200
in the wrong direction.

280
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,800
Oh, there's
nothing serious.

281
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,240
What I'm trying
to say is,

282
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,680
the children
are just not happy

283
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,120
away from you
and the theater.

284
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,040
Happy? Who told them
they're supposed to be happy?

285
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,480
They're supposed
to be learning things.

286
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,920
Well, in any event,

287
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,360
I think that you
and your husband

288
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,800
should have a talk
with them

289
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,720
and try to explain
to them how you feel.

290
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,160
Personally,
I find something

291
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,600
very rare and precious
in this feeling

292
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,480
they have for you
and your profession.

293
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,360
Of course, it's up
to you to decide.

294
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,280
Excuse me.
I'll get them.

295
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,800
Get that bit
about Tim?

296
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,240
"Natural born leader."

297
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,200
Look, birdbrain,

298
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,160
Father Dineen was trying
to tell us

299
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,480
in a very nice way

300
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,400
that we've got a little
gangster on our hands.

301
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,840
Didn't you get it?

302
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,280
The kids are going
to stay right here, Terry.

303
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
Who says they're not?

304
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,160
Don't act so innocent.
I know you.

305
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,600
You're a pushover
for those kids.

306
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
Me? You're the one

307
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
that's always
giving in to them.

308
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,920
Not this time.

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm going to be as firm
as the rock of Gibraltar.

310
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,680
The rock of Gibraltar.

311
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,560
The kids knew we bought
a house in Jersey,

312
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,960
but this was the first
time they'd seen it.

313
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,360
And what a time
to face a big fat mortgage.

314
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,640
Crash!

315
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,760
Depression!

316
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,680
And the first thing
that people gave up

317
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,120
was the theater.

318
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,040
And the first thing
the theater gave up

319
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
was the Donahues.

320
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,920
Boy, the things
we had to do

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,360
to make a buck.

322
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,800
A couple of seasons there,

323
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,240
we even split up.

324
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,520
# She's not so good
in the house #

325
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,440
# But on a bench
in the park #

326
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,200
# You'd be surprised #

327
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,320
# She isn't much
in the light #

328
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
# But when she gets
in the dark #

329
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,160
# You'd be surprised #

330
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,560
# At a party
or at a ball #

331
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,800
# I got to admit,
she's nothin' at all #

332
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,560
# But in the Morris chair #

333
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,760
# You'd be surprised #

334
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,200
And when I say coffee,

335
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,120
I don't mean
just any coffee.

336
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,000
I mean Shelby's
aerated, vacuumized

337
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,920
flavor in the bean
coffee,

338
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,840
which comes in three
delicious grinds:

339
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,960
Instant...

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,040
perk...

341
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
And drip.

342
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,600
# So #

343
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,520
# Let's have
another cup of coffee #

344
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,960
Yes, let's have another cup

345
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
of Shelby's
aerated coffee.

346
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,720
# And let's have
another piece of pie #

347
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,120
Then one day
things started picking up.

348
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,040
We were in the chips again,

349
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,440
playing big picture houses
all across the country.

350
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,880
Till about '37.

351
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,800
That was the year
Tim surprised us all

352
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,240
and graduated
from high school.

353
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,080
And we started
working out a new act

354
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,520
for the whole family.

355
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,880
Katy's love was dancing,
and the kid was good.

356
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
Steve was no hoofer,

357
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,720
but he sure could
sell a song.

358
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,120
Our name
for the new act?

359
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,520
What else?
The Five Donahues!

360
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,880
Working together,
we soon hit the top:

361
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,400
Headliners in a big
hippodrome extravaganza.

362

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,240
# Come on along,
come on along #

487
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:54,040
# To see and hear
Alexander's Ragtime Band #

488
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, you!

489
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,440
Hey, it went great,
huh, Pop?

490
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,520
Yeah, Tim. Fine.

491
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,000
You know who was
out front tonight? Flo.

492
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,080
Ziegfeld?

493
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
No, Flo Zimmerman,
my cousin from Passaic.

494
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,640
Mit de apple strudel
und the lager beer.

495
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,080
- Lager beer. Skol.
- Skol.

496
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,160
Hi, Timmy.

497
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,280
Oh, hiya, kid.

498
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,720
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

499
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,680
Oh, excusen me.

500
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,120
Important business
up and comin'.

501
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,240
You're excused.

502
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,360
Good-bye.

503
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,800
Terry, have you ever
had a talk with Tim

504
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,080
about--you know--girls?

505
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,520
Yeah, a few times,

506
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
but he wouldn't give me
any phone numbers.

507
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,760
No, seriously!

508
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,720
You kidding?
That'd be like me

509
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,160
teaching Dempsey
how to fight.

510
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,080
I wish they'd pick
on someone their own age.

511
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,520
Yeah, me, too.

512
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,360
I hope the kids are ready.
I'm starved.

513
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,480
Me, too.

514
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,080
Come in.

515
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,480
Hiya, Stevie.
Be with you in a minute.

516
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,400
Mind if I go on ahead?

517
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,840
Got a date?

518
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,960
No, no.

519
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,400
It's such a beautiful night,

520
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,840
I just feel like walking.

521
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,280
I got some
thinking to do.

522
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
OK, if that's
your idea of fun.

523
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,640
See you later.

524
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,400
So long, Steve.

525
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,840
Terry.

526
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,960
What?

527
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,880
Do you think something's
bothering Steve?

528
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,000
Why?

529
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,400
Well, he seems
so far away these days.

530
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,280
I mean, he's not
always with you.

531
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,680
Kind of like a poet
or something.

532
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,120
Maybe
he'll write lyrics.

533
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
No, it's not that.
It's...

534
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,600
No, it's not that,
either. It's...

535
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,520
I don't know,
but it's something.

536
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,640
Yeah.

537
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,040
Well, I'm glad
we got that cleared up.

538
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,160
Ready?

539
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,480
Katy, we're ready.

540
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
Katy, you in there?

541
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,640
Where could she be?

542
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,560
She's usually
the first one.

543
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,880
Tim?

544
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,040
Timothy?

545
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,560
How about it?

546
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,520
Fine.

547
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,960
We'll be right back.

548
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,400
Well, uh, don't hurry.

549
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,320
You better bring us
another gin and tonic,

550
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,720
another straight bourbon,
another scotch and soda...

551
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,640
and another
ginger ale, please.

552
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,760
Ginger ale.

553
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,160
Why don't you break down
and have a real drink?

554
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,280
Relax.

555
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,040
Oh, I'm completely relaxed.

556
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,760
Well, this is more like it.

557
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,680
That other place
was a creep joint.

558
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,280
Yeah, and the one
before it was a morgue.

559
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,560
Right.
I'll check my hat.

560
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,880
OK, baby.

561
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,120
Miss?

562
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,200
Uh, Miss?

563
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,680
Good evening, sir.

564
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,600
Welcome to Gallagher's
Golden Pheasant Room.

565
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,000
Check your hat, sir?

566
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,880
Try it again,

567
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
a little bit more
from the chest.

568
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,760
Oh, you think so?
My vocal teacher sa--

569
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,680
My vocal teacher says

570
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,120
it's all diaphragm.

571
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,440
All diaphragm?
Hmm hmm.

572
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,400
I'd say there's
quite a lot else there.

573
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,400
Tell me,
what's a girl

574
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,680
with such
pear-shaped tones

575
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,120
doing checking hats?

576
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,560
I am temporarily
between engagements.

577
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,680
Six months temporarily.

578
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,120
And a girl has to eat

579
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,560
and pay
for her singing lessons.

580
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,960
Oh, you're a singer?
I could've sworn

581
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,400
you were
a dramatic actress.

582
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,680
You think
that's impossible.

583
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,600
No, no,
I can just see it now:

584
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,040
You as Lady Macbeth.

585
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,480
What a sleep-walking
scene!

586
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,240
I wonder if some evening
you'd mind--

587
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,800
Skip it. I don't
give private auditions.

588
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,760
Number 35.

589
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,360
How now, brown cow?

590
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,520
Good evening, sir.
Welcome to--

591
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,440
Eddie, did you get him?
Is he coming over?

592
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,880
Yeah. Believe it or not,

593
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,760
the great Lew Harris is
coming over to hear you.

594
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,200
He's on his way.

595
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,640
Helen, take over
for me, will you?

596
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,080
Well, sure, honey.
What's up?

597
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,520
Lew Harris
is coming over.

598
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,960
Lew Harris?
The producer?

599
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,400
I'm going to sing
with the band.

600
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,840
Oh, good luck, honey.

601
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,280
Is this the dress?

602
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,720
Are you sure
it's the right one?

603
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,640
He said it was
the one you picked out.

604
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,560
It cost and arm
and a leg just to rent.

605
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,960
I hope you know
what you're doing.

606
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,400
Eddie, will you
stop worrying?

607
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,800
I've known what I was doing
since I was 6 years old.

608
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,240
Does Gallagher know
you're going on,

609
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,680
or is this a secret

610
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,120
between you
and the band?

611
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,560
Sure, Mr. Gallagher's
in on it.

612
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,480
He knows I've worked
in clubs before.

613
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,400
But how can you
go on and sing

614
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,840
with a strange band?

615
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,280
I'm not singing
with a strange band.

616
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,720
I rehearsed with them
all afternoon,

617
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,160
and they're very friendly.

618
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,600
The head waiter's name
is Carlos.

619
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,520
He has a very good table
for you and Mr. Harris.

620
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,440
And the drinks
are on the house.

621
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,880
Carlos is in on it, too?

622
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,800
Of course. He's even going
to make the waiters

623
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,240
stop serving
while I sing,

624
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,680
and he's very
friendly, too.

625
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
I have been an agent
for a good many years,

626
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,520
but this is
the first time

627
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,720
the client
has ever managed me.

628
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,120
Oh, and another thing.

629
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,040
When you bring him back
to see me,

630
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,960
I want to show him
that I'm an actress, too.

631
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,880
<i>I've been working on a scene
from The Cherry Orchard.</i>

632
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,320
<i>The Cherry Orchard.</i>

633
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,760
Vicky, let's save the acting

634
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,160
as a surprise for him
for later. Much later.

635
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,560
Right now, Mr. Harris
wants a singer.

636
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,920
A hot singer!

637
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,160
What song
are you singing?

638
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,480
I'm singing

639
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,720
"After You Get What You Want,
You Don't Want It."

640
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,640
Vicky, for the love
of Mike,

641
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,200
will you forget that
elocution stuff?

642
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,640
<i>It's
After</i>

643
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,040
<i>You Get What You Want.
After. After. After.</i>

644
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
OK, Eddie. You run down
and wait for Mr. Harris.

645
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,080
I'll change.

646
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,000
<i>After.</i>

647
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,440
After.

648
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,880
After.

649
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,760
After.

650
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,680
The girls
in the chorus say

651
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,120
you're not to be trusted.

652
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,560
Yeah? What else
they say about me?

653
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,000
Wouldn't you
like to know?

654
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,120
Yeah.

655
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,560
I beg your pardon.
May I please get by here?

656
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,000
Well, if it isn't
Ethel Barrymore.

657
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,440
It was only
yesterday--

658
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,360
Please, let's not play
any more games.

659
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm in an awful hurry.

660
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,720
Must be losing my grip.

661
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,160
Something's
happening to me.

662
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,600
You're getting old,
Buster.

663
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,000
Why, you must be
almost 20.

664
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,920
What difference does it
make how old a man is?

665
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,360
Listen, Cheri,

666
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,280
one man in 20 years
may still be a baby,

667
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,720
<i>a mere enfant,</i>

668
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,640
but another may have
lived a full lifetime,

669
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,080
seen everything,
done everything.

670
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,480
<i>It is not how old
you are, mon patoot.</i>

671
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,920
It is the way
you have lived.

672
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,840
It's the wine
you have drunk,

673
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,280
the music
you have heard,

674
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,720
and the women
you have known.

675
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,600
Oh, the stories
I could tell you, kid.

676
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,040
Yeah?
So tell me.

677
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,960
Well, I--Hey, hey.
I'll take the bottle.

678
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,600
And bring another
double gin

679
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,120
for Snow White.

680
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,520
You know,
you're real cute.

681
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,600
Oh.

682
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Well, uh, bottom's up.

683
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,440
You're pretty cute
yourself.

684
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,360
Well, now,
that's more like it.

685
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,200
I thought you were great
in the show tonight.

686
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,640
Oh, did you?

687
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,080
Uh-huh.
You were swell.

688
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,520
Oh, thank you,
but you know,

689
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,440
you didn't see
all of it.

690
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,560
No?

691
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,480
No. We've got a lot
of comedy stuff

692
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,920
that we didn't do.
Real slapstick.

693
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,360
I like slapstick.

694
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,800
I'll bet you do.

695
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,720
We have one bit
that never fails.

696
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,160
Here.
I'll show you.

697
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,560
Put your hands out
like this, flat.

698
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,000
Now, I take
these two glasses

699
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,920
and put them like so.

700
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,040
And?

701
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,160
That's all.

702
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,760
Bye!

703
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,080
Hey!

704
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,600
Mr. Harris' table.

705
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,040
We have a reservation.

706
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,960
Yes, sir.
This way, please.

707
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

708
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,800
ladies and gentlemen,

709
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,680
Gallagher's has a little
surprise for you tonight:

710
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,080
A new young talent,
Miss Victoria Hoffman.

711
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,520
Come on, everybody,

712
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,440
let's give the little girl
a great big welcome.

713
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,360
# After you get
what you want #

714
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,400
# You don't want it #

715
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,480
# If I gave you the moon #

716
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,000
# You'd grow tired
of it soon #

717
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,600
# You're like a baby #

718
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,760
# You want what you want
when you want it #

719
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,680
# But after you are
presented #

720
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,960
# With what you want #

721
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,840
# You're discontented #

722
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,160
# You're always
wishing and wanting for #

723
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,760
# Something #

724
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,440
# When you get
what you want #

725
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,840
# You don't want
what you get #

726
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,800
# And though I
sit upon your knee #

727
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,480
# You grow tired of me #

728
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,720
# 'Cause after #

729
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,480
# You get what you want #

730
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,320
# You don't want what
you wanted at all #

731
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,760
# Changeable #

732
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,920
# You've got
a changeable nature #

733
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,560
# Always, always
changing your mind #

734
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
# There's a longing
in your eye #

735
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,560
# Hard to satisfy #

736
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:28,280
# And here's
the reason why #

737
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,400
# 'Cause after #

738
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,680
# You get what you want #

739
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,520
# You don't want it #

740
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,680
# If I gave you the moon #

741
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,680
# You'd grow tired
of it soon #

742
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,880
# You're like a baby #

743
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,200
# You want what you want
when you want it #

744
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,800
# But after you are
presented #

745
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,560
# With what you want #

746
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,760
# You're discontented #

747
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,800
# You're always
wishing and wanting for #

748
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,200
# Something #

749
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,040
# When you get
what you want #

750
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,440
# You don't want
what you get #

751
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,320
# And though I sit
upon your knee #

752
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,320
# You grow tired of me #

753
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,240

# You don't want
what you wanted at all #

756
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,920
# Baby, I don't mean
to make you blue #

757
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,760
# But you need
a talkin' to #

758
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,480
# 'Cause after #

759
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,880
# You get what you want #

760
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,960
# You don't want
what you wanted at all #

761
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,760
I know you!

762
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,680
Well, what do you think?

763
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,440
I'm interested.

764
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,400
I knew it.

765
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,160
I knew you'd
flip your lid

766
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,240
over this girl.
Ha ha ha ha.

767
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,640
How do you do, Mr. Harris?

768
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,480
Hello, Mr. Harris.

769
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,480
Hi there, Mr. Harris.

770
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,840
Hello.

771
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,960
Oh, not again.

772
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,880
I'm waiting for someone
terribly important.

773
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,480
This is
terribly important, too.

774
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,040
<i>I happen to be
Kirby from Variety.</i>

775
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,280
I think the world
should know about you.

776
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,320
How about an interview?

777
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,040
This not another one
of your little jokes.

778
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,160
Oh, no,
not when I'm working.

779
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,360
The only thing is I'm
expecting these people.

780
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,480
That's all right.
Why don't we start

781
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,960
and see how far we get.
Oh, excuse me.

782
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,240
Uh, tell me, have you had
any previous experience?

783
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,600
Doing what?

784
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,240
I was thinking
of your stage career,

785
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,200
but I'd be interested
in anything else

786
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,160
you have to tell me.

787
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,600
I see.

788
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,480
Why don't I give you
my telephone number?

789
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,440
Why don't you?

790
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,240
I have
a much better idea.

791
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,960
<i>I'll call you
tomorrow at Variety,</i>

792
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,120
and we can make a date.

793
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,400
Oh, it's, uh, well,

794
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,840
tomorrow happens
to be my day off.

795
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,560
I was afraid
of something like that.

796
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,560
Excuse me.
That must be my guests.

797
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,560
Oh, hello.

798
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,560
Vicky, this is
Mr. Lew Harris.

799
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,120
Charmed, I'm sure.

800
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,000
I enjoyed your performance,
Miss Hoffman.

801
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,480
Did you?
Did you really?

802
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,480
Come in please.

803
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,240
This gentleman
was just leaving.

804
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,480
Tim Donahue.
How are you, kid?

805
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
I hear you and the family
are knockin' 'em dead

806
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,520
over at the Hippodrome.

807
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,480
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

808
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,800
One of
The Five Donahues?

809
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,480
Oh, you do
a great act.

810
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,720
I didn't know
you knew him.

811
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,960
We just met.
Mr. Donahue,

812
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,640
it was awfully sweet
of you to come back

813
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,880
and tell me how much
you admired my work.

814
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
When one performer

815
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,360
troubles
to tell another,

816
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,000
that's praise indeed.
And tell your family

817
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,280
while I do
appreciate it,

818
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,600
I couldn't possibly
join their act.

819
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,720
I'll tell 'em,

820
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,480
but they'll
be broken-hearted.

821
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,560
I'm sorry, but there are
five of you already,

822
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,760
and I much prefer
working as a single,

823
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,480
if you know what I mean,
and I think you do.

824
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Mad about me.

825
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,760
Timmy, where you been?

826
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,360
I been lookin'
everywhere for you.

827
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,880
I just fumbled,
and the coach took me out.

828
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
Whoop,
that's a cute step.

829
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,600
Come on,
let's go someplace

830
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,120
where they appreciate me.

831
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,520
Oh, this is silly.

832
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,320
After all, they're
not children anymore.

833
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,440
No. Come on,
I got a good hand.

834
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,800
They're certainly old enough
to take care of themselves.

835
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,360
Exactly. You go.

836
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,880
Why do you suppose
they didn't tell us,

837
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,360
just sneaking out
that way without--

838
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,200
Molly, that's just
part of growing up.

839
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,000
Remember our first date?

840
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,880
Yeah.

841
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,640
We didn't tell anybody,
either.

842
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,680
No.

843
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,960
You remember how late
we stayed out?

844
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,000
Mm-hmm.

845
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,280
You should've been
ashamed of yourself.

846
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,600
Where the heck
is Katy?

847
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,560
Take it easy.
Now you got me worried.

848
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,400
It's about time,
you big lug.

849
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,560
Here's a taxi.

850
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,720
What do you mean
by coming home

851
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,920
at this hour,
young lady?

852
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,360
You have some
explaining to do.

853
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,640
How sweet of you
to wait up for me.

854
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,760
Do pay the cab fare,
darling.

855
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm flat.

856
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,840
Where did
you pick her up?

857
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,320
Outside of Gallagher's joint.

858
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,600
How much do I owe you?

859
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,640
6.20.

860
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,760
6.20? How'd ya come,
by way of Canarsie?

861
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,960
I brought her home,
didn't I?

862
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,360
Thanks.
Got change of 20?

863
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,720
Oh, yeah.

864
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,560
And for all I know, Mom,

865
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,240
he's still sitting there,

866
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,400
dripping.

867
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
Let me tell you about
the one I used to use.

868
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,800
A handbag
full of nickels--

869
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,040
anybody got fresh--
clunk.

870
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,960
We used to call it
the woman's defender.

871
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,840
What's so funny?
Your daughter stays out

872
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,400
gallivanting till
all hours of the morning,

873
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,520
and you think
it's a big joke.

874
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,880
Maybe Katy never went
to finishing school,

875
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,600
but there are some parts
of her education

876
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,480
I'll match against anybody's.

877
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,280
Um, Tim get home yet?

878
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,800
No. Why? You see him?
You know where he is?

879
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,800
No. I just wondered.

880
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,800
Where in blazes
have you been?

881
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,800
In church.

882
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,120
Church?

883
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,080
Now I've heard
everything.

884
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,240
No, seriously.

885
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,600
Church at this time
of night?

886
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
I went for a walk
through the park first.

887
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,960
Who with?

888
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,720
Nobody. Just myself.

889
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,160
Mom, Dad,

890
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,600
there's something
I want to tell you.

891
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,040
Well...

892
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
I don't want you to think

893
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,600
I haven't given this
a lot of thought, but...

894
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,640
Go on.

895
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,920
I'm going
to be a priest.

896
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,880
A what?!

897
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,040
A priest.

898
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,200
You're kidding.

899
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,920
Steve, what are
you talkin' about?

900
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,600
I know this
comes as a big shock

901
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,080
to all of you, but...

902
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,080
it's what I want

903
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,480
more than anything else
in the world.

904
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,200
A priest?!
Why, you must be abs--

905
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,640
Let him finish, Terry.

906
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,080
I talked to Father Dineen

907
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,960
about it last summer.
Today I got a letter

908
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,960
telling me to report
to the seminary

909
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,920
next week.

910
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,320
I am not going
to let you do it.

911
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,280
Terry--

912
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,280
Now, you
stay out of this.

913
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,240
Look, son,
you're very young.

914
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,200
You don't understand

915
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,240
what a wonderful thing
life can be.

916
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,720
You don't know
how wonderful it is

917
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,120
to fall in love
and get married

918
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,120
and raise a family.

919
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,560
I'm not gonna let you
give all that up.

920
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,600
I've thought
about it, Pop.

921
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,160
It's just that some people
are meant to be one thing,

922
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,840
some another.

923
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,960
What about your work?

924
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,200
What about everything
you've been trained for?

925
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,440
What about the theater?

926
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,760
In a way, it's just
a change of booking.

927
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,760
You must admit the church
has had a pretty long run.

928
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,880
I just hope
I have the talent for it.

929
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,280
Beats me.

930
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,440
I can't figure it out.

931
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,960
# Come on along,
come on along #

932
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,520
# Alexander's
Ragtime Band #

933
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,840
# Come on along #
Hello, everybody.

934
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,000
Oh, great.

935
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,400
He's crocked.

936
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,320
I beg your pardon--
stinkied.

937
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,160
Whoops, forgot
to remove my hat.

938
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,160
I'll fix him.

939
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
- Now--
- Pop--

940
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,400
I can handle him. I've been
handling him his whole life.

941
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,320
Is there some sort
of dispute going on?

942
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,120
Can I be
of any assis--

943
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,400
Can I be of any--

944
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,440
Oh, Mom, I don't
feel so good.

945
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,600
Oh, no, you don't.
Upstairs for you.

946
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,400
I just had
this carpet cleaned.

947
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,040
What a family.
One of 'em

948
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,120
goes sneaking off
to a nightclub,

949
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,880
one of ‘em comes home
smelling like a saloon,

950
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,480
and the third one--you--
I might've expected you

951
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,720
to come home drunk like Tim,
but I will be a Hindu swami

952
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,280
if I expected
what you gave me tonight.

953
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,800
Pop, don't take it
so big.

954
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,000
Steve might turn out

955
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,160
to be something
really big,

956
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,040
like a bishop
or even a cardinal.

957
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,640
Yeah? The only cardinal
I want in this family

958
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,320
is one that plays ball
with St. Louis.

959
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,000
I could take a--

960
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,000
Bath.

961
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,160
Big man now.
Comin' home like--

962
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,640
You're drowning me.

963
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,320
Don't put any ideas
in my head.

964
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,280
Yeah, but I--

965
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,960
Down, boy. Down.

966
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,840
And don't come up
till I tell ya.

967
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,880
Where am I?

968
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,440
Here.

969
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,440
Give me that.

970
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,800
Will you please, Ma?

971
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,760
Timmy, this hurts you
more than it hurts me.

972
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,480
Now get in there.

973
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,760
I'm getting there.

974
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,320
Come on, get in.
Hurry up.

975
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,200
This way. Put your head
down here on the pillow.

976
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,160
Come on.

977
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,920
All right,
let's have it, sport.

978
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,520
Who were you out with?

979
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,920
Lillian Sawyer.

980
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,360
That tomato?

981
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,720
I think I asked her
to marry me, Mom.

982
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,000
I know I proposed
something.

983
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,440
I bet you did.
What'd you have to drink?

984
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,240
I don't remember,
but we topped it off

985
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,680
with champagne
and root beer.

986
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,000
I was trying to forget.

987
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,000
Forget what?

988
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,360
That's another thing
I don't remember.

989
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,480
Another girl, I think.

990
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,280
Little man,
you've had a busy night.

991
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,840
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

992
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,600
Everything's going
round and round, Ma.

993
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,280
Yes, I know. I know.

994
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,240
You go to sleep now.
We'll talk this over

995
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,200
in the morning.

996
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,160
Oh.

997
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,120
I'm sorry, Mom.

998
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,840
I know you are, kid,

999
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,360
and I'm sorry, too,
if I hurt you.

1000
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,800
It's just that
we love you so much

1001
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,240
that we intend
to make a man out of you,

1002
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,240
even if we have
to murder you first.

1003
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,720
Thanks, Mom.

1004
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,160
Go to sleep now.

1005
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,720
Good night, Ma.

1006
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,280
Good night, Tim.

1007
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,880
Is he all right?

1008
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,440
Oh, he's fine now,

1009
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,400
but what he's gonna
feel like in the morning.

1010
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,560
Anyway, I hope so.
Steve, I wanna talk to you.

1011
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,360
Sure, Mom.

1012
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,080
Are you disappointed
in me, too,

1013
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,480
the way Dad is?

1014
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,240
You can't blame
your father, Steve,

1015
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,120
the way you
threw it at him,

1016
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,080
just cold,
without any build-up.

1017
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,520
He wasn't lookin' for it.

1018
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,680
He had different plans
for you.

1019
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,640
There's still
Katy and Tim.

1020
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,640
Yes, but you're
the firstborn.

1021
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,680
There's always something
about the first.

1022
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,760
Life's funny.
You raise a kid backstage,

1023
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,760
you teach him
every trick you know

1024
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,480
about singing and dancing
and how to make people laugh,

1025
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,200
and then one day, this.

1026
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Why? How come?

1027
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,640
I don't know, Ma.
It's inside me.

1028
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,480
It must have
always been there.

1029
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,880
It's like losin' ya, Steve.

1030
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,400
Oh, I know,
not really, but--

1031
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,760
Then you are
disappointed.

1032
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,120
No, I'm not disappointed.
It's a wonderful thing.

1033
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,640
I'm just not
used to it yet,

1034
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,040
but I'm proud.
Very proud.

1035
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,880
Mom.

1036
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
# Remember the night #

1037
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,880
# Remember the night #

1038
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,560
# The night you said #

1039
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,360
# I love you? #

1040
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,400
# Remember? #

1041
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,920
# Remember,
my love #

1042
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,800
# All the stars #

1043
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,320
# Above you? #

1044
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,000
# Remember? #

1045
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,600
# Remember, we vowed
to own this spot #

1046
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,800
# And after I learned
to care a lot #

1047
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,680
# You promised that you'd #

1048
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,040
# Forget me not #

1049
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,920
# But you forgot #

1050
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,440
# To reme-em-em-ber #

1051
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,320
When do we open?

1052
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,280
Where?

1053
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,880
Have another sandwich.

1054
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,120
Oh, come on,
let's go inside.

1055
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,120
They're starting.

1056
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,600
Showtime.

1057
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,080
Quiet!

1058
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,680
Showtime! Showtime!

1059
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,600
You all get settled down.

1060
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,200
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

1061
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,720
There. Now, since you were
nice enough to surprise me,

1062
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,400
I have a surprise for you.

1063
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,880
We have a couple of
very talented young people

1064
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,200
here with us tonight--songs,
dances, and impressions--

1065
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,920
And they would like
to perform for you.

1066
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,360
Now, this act
hasn't been seen

1067
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,920
in something like
20 years,

1068
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,440
and if I'm any
judge of talent,

1069
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,080
it'll never be seen again.

1070
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Two Donahues!!

1071
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,080
# When that
midnight choo-choo #

1072
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,320
# Leaves for Alabam' #

1073
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,320
# I gotta catch that train #

1074
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,840
# I'll be right there #

1075
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,800
# I got my fare #

1076
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,960
# When I see that
rusty-haired conductor man #

1077
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,080
# I gotta find that man #

1078
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,600
# I'll grab him
by the collar #

1079
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,600
# And I'll holler #

1080
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,040
- # Ala #
- # Bam' #

1081
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,920
# That's where you
stop your train #

1082
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,880
# That brings me
back again #

1083
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,640
# Down home
where I'll remain #

1084
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,240
# Where my honey lamb am #

1085
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,200
# I will be
right there with bells #

1086
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,200
# When that
old conductor yells #

1087
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,960
# All aboard, all aboard #

1088
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,600
# All aboard
for Alabamy #

1089
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,720
# For Alabam' #

1090
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,800
# For Alabamy #

1091
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,960
Board!

1092
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,680
# I'll be right there
with bells #

1093
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,880
# When that
old conductor yells #

1094
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,520
# All aboo-rd #

1095
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,600
# For Alabam' #

1096
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,360
# When that midnight
choo-choo leaves for #

1097
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,360
# Alabam' #

1098
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,840
Thank you.

1099
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,200
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1100
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,360
My sister and I
both thank you.

1101
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,600
Would you like to say
a few words, sweetheart?

1102
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,520
Yes.

1103
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,560
Thank you. That's enough.

1104
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,520
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the piece de résistance.</i>

1105
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,840
We're supposed
to add a new song

1106
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,840
to our act
for next season,

1107
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,400
but the fella who was
supposed to sing it

1108
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,640
got himself a new job.

1109
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,960
It's not as much money
as we were paying him,

1110
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,160
but that's
what he wants to do,

1111
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,320
so we're all for him.
Would you like to hear it?

1112
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

1113
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,320
your guest of honor,
Mr. Steven Donahue.

1114
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,000
Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago,

1115
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,760
when we were
playing down in Memphis,

1116
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,120
I heard a song
that impressed me very much,

1117
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,720
and it's
the kind of a song

1118
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
we snap our fingers
and clap our hands,

1119
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,960
and I want you
to come along with me.

1120
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,360
We'll have a little fun.

1121
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,840
# Brothers #

1122
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,120
# And sisters #

1123
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,720
# Listen #

1124
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,360
# You non-believers, listen #

1125
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,960
# You better
start to believe #

1126
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,440
# All you doubters #

1127
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,920
# Be hallelujah shouters #

1128
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,760
# Or else
you're going to grieve #

1129
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,920
# There's no time to wait #

1130
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,040
# You may be too late #

1131
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,280
# So listen #

1132
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,160
# You don't know
what you're missin' #

1133
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:22,840
# Until you
start to believe #

1134
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,040
# If you believe #

1135
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,920
# That there's a heaven #

1136
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,280
# You'll get to heaven #

1137
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,960
# If you believe #

1138
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:48,440
# If you believe
that there are angels #

1139
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,120
# You'll see the angels #

1140
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,640
# If you believe #

1141
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,280
# I'm not making promises #

1142
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:08,840
# To the doubting Thomases #

1143
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:16,720
# But if you believe
the Lord can help you #

1144
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,360
# The Lord will help you #

1145
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,880
# If you believe #

1146
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,080
# Do you believe? #

1147
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,120
# We do,
we do, we do #

1148
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,360
# Do you believe? #

1149
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,680
# We do,
we do, we do #

1150
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,600
# Well, Jonah went out
one night in a gale #

1151
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,600
# Do you believe that? #

1152
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,520
# We do, we do, we do #

1153
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,960
# Soon he was
swallowed up by a whale #

1154
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,320
# Do you believe that? #

1155
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,920
# We do,
we do, we do #

1156
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,360
# Daniel laid down
with lions that roared #

1157
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,160
# Noah was on his ark
when it poured #

1158
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,440
# Moses looked up,
and he spoke to the Lord #

1159
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,640
# Do you believe that? #

1160
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,120
# Do you believe that? #

1161
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,080
# We do #

1162
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,520
# We do,
we do, we do #

1163
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:05,920
# Now, I'm not making promises #

1164
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:15,320
# To the doubting Thomases #

1165
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:23,560
# But if you believe
the Lord can help you #

1166
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:31,560
# The Lord will help you #

1167
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:43,480
# If you believe #

1168
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,080
More! More!

1169
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,000
More! More!

1170
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,400
Thank you very much.

1171
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,160
I hope you won't take this
as my farewell performance.

1172
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,760
I'm just going into rehearsal
now for four years,

1173
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,800
and when I get
the new act put together--

1174
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,640
New material, new costumes--
I hope you'll all

1175
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,400
find the time
to come and see me.

1176
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,360
Will you?

1177
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,880
Thank you.

1178
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,760
We're going
to miss you around here.

1179
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,200
Somebody put a slice of
raw onion in this sandwich.

1180
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,520
You better
give me a bite.

1181
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,160
I need an excuse, too.

1182
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,960
Florida.

1183
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
We now take you
to beautiful Florida,

1184
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,520
land of golden sunshine,
balmy breezes,

1185
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,520
swaying palm trees.

1186
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,920
Playground
of the millionaires.

1187
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,600
Yeah. Things
were going so swimmingly

1188
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,920
for The Four Donahues,

1189
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,160
one winter, we even
vacationed there.

1190
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,520
Some vacation.

1191
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,840
Two shows a night.
Three on Saturdays.

1192
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,680
# Ta-da-da-da-da-ta #

1193
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,960
# Tropical heat wave #

1194
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,920
# Da-da-da-da-ta #

1195
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,840
# Da-da-da-da-ta,
bum-bum #

1196
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,480
Your aim's gettin' better.

1197
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,800
I take it those
are the new costumes

1198
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,760
<i>for the Heat Wave
number.</i>

1199
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,880
Yeah. Cuban. You like?

1200
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,880
Yeah.

1201
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,840
You better.
They cost a week's salary.

1202
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,800
A week's salary?

1203
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,160
If the number
doesn't go,

1204
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,120
we can always
eat the act.

1205
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,120
Take your hands away.

1206
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,200
Those grapes cost
a dollar a piece.

1207
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,240
<i>Muchachas, we are
in the wrong business.</i>

1208
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,560
Oh, take the arrangements
down to the band

1209
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,520
and go over
the routine with them

1210
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,480
before we rehearse.

1211
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,440
OK, Mom.

1212
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,440
If you see Katy,
send her in here.

1213
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,360
All right.

1214
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,320
Hold it, fellas.

1215
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,320
Mac, would mind trying
the vocal with me first?

1216
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,400
Just easy, you know?
When the boys get here,

1217
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,400
we can
take it from the top.

1218
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,000
OK, honey. Let's try it.

1219
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,200
Hi, Tim.

1220
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,160
Hi.

1221
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,920
Vicky, do you know
Tim Donahue?

1222
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,480
Miss Vicky Parker.

1223
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,600
Hello, Mr. Donahue.

1224
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,680
Victoria Hoffman--
Gallagher's.

1225
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,720
Right.

1226
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,560
But he said
Vicky Parker.

1227
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,640
Don't tell me
you're married.

1228
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,640
Don't tell me

1229
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,400
this is going to be
another interview.

1230
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,480
Are you?

1231
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,560
Mac, did you know

1232
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,040
that Mr. Donahue,
in his spare time,

1233
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,200
is a well-known
reporter?

1234
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,840
- Yeah.
- Are ya?

1235
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,480
No, Mr. Donahue.
I have a new manager,

1236
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,920
and he's doing me
over completely.

1237
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,200
New name, new clothes,
new, uh...

1238
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,120
I guess everything else
is pretty much the same.

1239
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,720
Yeah. But my
sensitive ear tells me

1240
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,880
that you're not using
quite as much diaphragm.

1241
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,120
My vocal teacher
is gone with the wind,

1242
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,920
and please
don't remind me.

1243
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,400
Ah, dear. And I thought
this was just gonna be

1244
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,640
another
nightclub engagement.

1245
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,160
Thank you, fellas.

1246
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,760
I couldn't have said it
any better myself.

1247
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,560
Would you
mind terribly

1248
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,880
if we got on
with the rehearsal?

1249
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,360
Of course not.
You go right ahead.

1250
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,800
I'll just sit right here
and watch you.

1251
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,760
Help yourself.
Won't bother me.

1252
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,520
It'll bother me,
but I like it.

1253
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,680
OK, Mac.

1254
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,560
# We're havin' a heat wave #

1255
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,640
# A tropical heat wave #

1256
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,480
# The temperature's rising,
it isn't surprising #

1257
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,440
# She's certainly-- #

1258
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,800
Hold it.
Wait a second.

1259
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,760
Hold it, fellas. Hold it.

1260
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,040
This is terrible.

1261
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,000
Terrible?

1262
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,800
No, you don't understand.

1263
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,560
You can't
use that song.

1264
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,520
We're using it.
We have new costumes

1265
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,360
and new arrangements.
Well, it's all set.

1266
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,320
It's a big number.

1267
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,360
You're joking.

1268
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,680
I wish I was.

1269
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,080
<i>But Heat Wave's
my big number, too.</i>

1270
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,120
It is?

1271
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,600
What are
we going to do?

1272
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,320
My whole act's
built around it.

1273
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,680
I have boys
working with me...

1274
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,240
but of course,

1275
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,440
you're the headliners,

1276
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,080
so I guess it's out.

1277
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,560
I'll just have to cancel

1278
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,640
and go back
to New York.

1279
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,560
No, you can't do that.
What about us?

1280
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,920
What about all the things
we're gonna do together?

1281
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,840
But, Tim,
what else can I do?

1282
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,800
It puts me
in a terrible spot.

1283
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,080
Well--

1284
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,280
I'll tell you what,
forget about it.

1285
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,680
Forget the whole thing.
You go right ahead.

1286
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,240
It's your number. There are
lots of things we can do.

1287
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,040
We'll work something out.
I'll go talk to the family.

1288
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,440
I'll see you later.

1289
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,600
I hope so.
And thank you.

1290
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,520
Yeah.
I'll see you later.

1291
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,040
Whew. That was close.
He had me worried.

1292
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,000
Not me. I never had
a moment's doubt.

1293
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,880
Gentlemen, the winner
and new champion.

1294
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,720
Wow!

1295
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,000
# We're havin' a heat wave #

1296
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,240
# A tropical heat wave #

1297
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,400
# The temperature's rising,
it isn't surprising #

1298
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,040
# She certainly can #

1299
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,040
# Can-can #

1300
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,680
# She started a heat wave #

1301
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,880
# By letting her seat wave #

1302
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,000
# In such a way that
the customers say that #

1303
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,320
# She certainly can #

1304
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,280
# Can-can #

1305
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,640
# Gee, gee #

1306
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,440
# Her anatomy #

1307
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,480
# Makes the mercury #

1308
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,480
# Zoom #

1309
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,440
# To 93 #

1310
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,240
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1311
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,280
# We're havin' a heat wave #

1312
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,320
# A tropical heat wave #

1313
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,160
# The way that she moves
that thermometer proves #

1314
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,240
# That she certainly can #

1315
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,720
What's your name, honey?

1316
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,720
Pablo.

1317
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,800
# Certainly can #

1318
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,760
Chico.

1319
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,880
# Certainly can #

1320
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,880
Miguelito.

1321
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,800
# Pablo #

1322
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,880
# Chico #

00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,840
# Miguelito #

1324
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,080
# Ahh! Can-can #

1325
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,240
# Pablo #

00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,760
# Where? #

00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,880
# Jamaica #

1332
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,440
# Moderately high
barometric pressure #

1333
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,680
# Will cover
the, uh, Northeast and #

1334
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,640
# Where else? #

1335
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,440
# The deep South #

1336
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,480
# Small danger of #

1337
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,440
# What? #

1338
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,680
# Fruit frost #

1339
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,640
# Hot and humid nights
can be expected #

1340
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,280
# St. Vincent, 95 #

# 105 #

1345
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,240
# We're havin' a heat wave #

1346
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,400
# A tropical #

1347
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,160
# Heat wave #

1348
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,960
# The temperature's rising #

1349
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,360
# It isn't surprising #

1350
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,360
# He certainly can #

1351
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,160
# Can #

1352
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,600
# I started this heat wave #

1353
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,560
# By #

1354
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,600
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1355
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,920
# And in such a way that #

1356
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,760
# The customers say that #

1357
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,880
# I certainly can #

1358
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,760
# Can-can #

1359
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:26,240
# Gee, gee, gee... #

1360
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,960
It's easy to see
why he did it.

1361
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:28,920
Ow!

1362
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,040
# Makes the mercury #

1363
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,280
# Rise to #

1364
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,200
# 93 #

1365
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,680
# We're havin' a heat wave #

1366
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,040
# A tropical, tropical
heat wave #

1367
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,200
# The way that I move
that thermometer proves #

1368
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,360
# She certainly #

1369
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,120
# Certainly,
certainly can #

1370
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,120
# I certainly, certainly,
certainly can #

1371
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,400
# Can-can #

1372
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,920
Yeah? Then
what happened?

1373
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,320
Then after Lew Harris bought
my contract from Eddie,

1374
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,440
he sent me out on the road
for a few seasons.

1375
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,280
He told me I had
an awful lot to learn

1376
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,840
and I talked as if I had
marshmallows in my mouth.

1377
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,080
Ha. I liked it.
It was different.

1378
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,760
Yes, like green hair.

1379
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,400
Yeah.

1380
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,640
It's lovely.

1381
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,600
You know,

1382
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,560
I never thought
anything like this

1383
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,080
could ever happen
to me.

1384
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,480
Well, anyway...

1385
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,680
I guess Lew thinks
I'm ready now.

1386
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,280
He's planning to build
a whole new revue

1387
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,640
around me next season
on Broadway.

1388
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,800
I'd like to build
something around you:

1389
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,280
A barbed-wire fence.

1390
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,440
Where do you think

1391
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,800
we should go
on our honeymoon?

1392
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,760
What?

1393
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,760
I think we oughta
stay right here.

1394
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,160
Then we wouldn't waste
all that time traveling,

1395
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,200
and, besides,

1396
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,880
they tell me the rainy
season's coming on.

1397
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,840
I really have to go, Tim.

1398
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,840
It's getting late.

1399
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,280
Why don't we get
a sandwich at the hotel?

1400
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,320
I'm hungry.

1401
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,080
We just had spaghetti
at the other place.

1402
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,000
You bought me
breadsticks, remember?

1403
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,840
Huh? Yeah. I forgot.

1404
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,080
Well, when we're married,
we won't eat out.

1405
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,520
We'll bake
our own breadsticks.

1406
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,680
Grow our own wheat?

1407
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,320
Sure. With a large family,
you gotta cut corners.

1408
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,280
Just how large a family
are you planning?

1409
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,680
Oh, quartet:
Baritone, tenor,

1410
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,960
soprano, alto.

1411
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,880
You like the script so far?

1412
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,080
You left out
a very important part:

1413
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,040
The menace.

1414
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,120
Oh, we don't need one.

1415
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,480
We'll keep it
light and airy.

1416
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,280
What if your heroine
is a career woman,

1417
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,720
gonna fight her way to
the top, no matter what?

1418
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,280
Then I'll clear
the path for her.

1419
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,240
Why, I'm...

1420
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,320
trustworthy,
loyal, helpful,

1421
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,280
friendly, courteous,
kind, obedient,

1422
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,240
cheerful, thrifty,

1423
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,840
brave, clean,
and reverent,

1424
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,760
and we could
start a fire

1425
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,160
without rubbing
two sticks together.

1426
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,240
What do you say, baby?

1427
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,080
Don't call us.
We'll call you.

1428
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,440
Good night, Tim.

1429
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,360
Is that all?

1430
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,320
Good night.

1431
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,120
Oh, I forgot to return
your breadstick.

1432
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,560
I'm awfully sorry.

1433
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,080
I'll forgive you.

1434
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,080
Good night.

1435
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,480
Is that still all?

1436
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,920
Tim, I had
a wonderful evening.

1437
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,360
I like you very much.

1438
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,520
I hope you ask me out
again sometime.

1439
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,280
And if you want
to kiss me good night...

1440
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,240
Mm-hmm.

1441
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,440
Good night.

1442
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,120
# A man chases a girl #

1443
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,480
# Until she catches him #

1444
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,800
# He runs after a girl #

1445
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,240
# Until he's caught #

1446
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,640
# He fishes for a girl #

1447
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,080
# Until she's landed him #

1448
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,360
# It all comes out exactly
the way she thought #

1449
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,320
# Uncertain #

1450
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,520
# He tags along behind #

1451
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,360
# Uncertain #

1452
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,480
# Till she
makes up his mind #

1453
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:49,000
# A man chases a girl
until she catches him #

1454
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:54,920
# But don't run too fast
while you are saying no #

1455
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,720
# And once
you've caught him #

1456
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,400
# Don't ever let him go #

1457
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,000
# A man chases a girl #

1458
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,800
# Until she catches him #

1459
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,600
# He runs after a girl #

1460
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,560
# Until he's caught #

1461
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,120
# He fishes for a girl #

1462
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,480
# Until she's landed him #

1463
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,080
# It all comes out #

1464
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,600
# Exactly the way
she thought #

1465
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,520
# Once you've got him #

1466
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,080
# Don't ever let him #

1467
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,880
# Once you've got him #

1468
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,040
# Don't ever let him #

1469
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,680
# Once you've got him #

1470
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,600
# Don't let him go #

1471
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,440
"Well, Mom, Latin and I are
finally on speaking terms,

1472
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,560
"and I am not as worried

1482

Let me see that.

1483
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,120
You know, it
wouldn't surprise me

1484
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,560
if he was top man
in his class.

1485
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,600
Morning, Pop.

1486
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,160
Morning, Mom.

1487
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,120
Would you like

1488
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,920
to try
that entrance again?

1489
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,880
See, I'm your father.

1490
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,960
This lady happens
to be your mother.

1491
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,040
Leave him alone, Terry.

1492
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,200
He hasn't got anything
straight for two weeks.

1493
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,120
Why should he start now?

1494
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,080
What's up?

1495
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,200
Let him eat.
He needs his strength.

1496
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,800
I'll get it.

1497
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,600
Hello.

1498
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,080
Yes, he's here.

1499
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,000
That girl who steals
everybody's material

1500
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,200
wants to talk to you.

1501
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,480
Shh!

1502
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,480
She'll hear you.

1503
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,120
Good. Maybe she'll
give me back my song.

1504
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,800
Hello, Vicky.

1505
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,160
How are you
this morning?

1506
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,600
Hmm?

1507
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,200
Yeah, it's me.

1508
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,000
No, really.

1509
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,440
No--no--no--no,

1510
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,400
there's
nothing wrong.

1511
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,880
It's just--yeah.

1512
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,920
Yeah, capacity.

1513
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,360
Standing room only.

1514
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,360
No, I haven't
had a chance

1515
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,080
to tell them yet.
I--I--I--

1516
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,040
Excuse me.

1517
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,200
Wait just a minute,
will ya, Vicky?

1518
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,640
Excuse me, Mother.

1519
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,000
Uh, excuse me.

1520
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,080
You know something?
I think they're married.

1521
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,080
Married? Who?

1522
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,560
Tim and that girl.
Didn't you hear him?

1523
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,680
"I haven't had a chance
to tell them yet."

1524
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,640
What else could it be?

1525
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,640
No, no, no.

1526
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,240
What do you mean,
"no, no, no"?

1527
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,440
Of course that's
what it is.

1528
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,440
What are we gonna do?

1529
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,600
They're not married.

1530
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,560
Then they're making plans.

1531
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,040
You've gotta step 'em,
Terry.

1532
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,000
Me?

1533
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,960
Certainly. You run this act.

1534
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,000
Ha! All of a sudden,

1535
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,360
when something goes
wrong, I run the act.

1536
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,680
Don't raise your voice
to me!

1537
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,640
What do you
think you are,

1538
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:46,600
Whispering
Jack Smith?

1539
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,520
Come in.

1540
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,800
Oh, it's love's
young dream.

1541
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,240
He locked himself in.

1542
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,680
There's no knob
on the inside.

1543
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,160
I'll complain
to the management.

1544
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,200
Tell them and get it
over with, will ya?

1545
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,880
OK.

1546
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,920
Uh, Mom, Pop...

1547
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,600
uh, Katy and me,
we, uh--

1548
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,080
Well, me and Katy--

1549
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,240
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

1550
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,040
Lew Harris is going
to star Vicky Parker

1551
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,800
in a big Broadway revue
next season--

1552
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,080
I got a great title
for it:

1553
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,000
<i>Something Borrowed
And Something Blue.</i>

1554
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,640
Now, come on, Mom.
Let Katy tell you, will ya?

1555
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,040
Well, Vicky wants
Tim and me

1556
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,400
to be in the show
with her,

1557
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,360
so she asked Mr. Harris

1558
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,480
to catch the act
last night,

1559
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,760
and he liked us,

1560
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,120
so he wants to sign us.

1561
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,000
And the question is,
should we or...

1562
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,360
or shouldn't we do it?

1563
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,960
First she takes our song,
and now...

1564
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,440
Oh, this kid and I

1565
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,520
have just gotta wind up
the best of chums.

1566
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,000
Well, I think
it's great.

1567
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,200
I think it's
just wonderful.

1568
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,640
Now, you understand
it's just Katy and me.

1569
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,680
That's why we didn't
say anything definite.

1570
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,400
Are you worrying about
your mother and me?

1571
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,600
Young lady,
we were an act

1572
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,360
before you
were an idea.

1573
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,920
And you, you weren't
even penciled in.

1574
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,480
What do you think
we raised you for

1575
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,920
if it wasn't for this?

1576
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,760
What do you say, Mom?

1577
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,160
OK.

1578
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,880
On one condition.

1579
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,440
They have to take
the four Cuban costumes, too.

1580
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,280

# Brother, you can
say that again #

1609
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,120
# It's my attitude
that's passive #

1610
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,080
Meow!

1611
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,240
Ruff!.

1612
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,160
# You know you're
the only one I love #

1613
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,880
# That's all,
he's hooked #

1614
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,840
# Bye, now #

1615
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,880
# Bye, now #

1616
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,520
# Hello #

1617
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,640
# We're off again #

1618
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,240
# No, sorry, not tonight #

1619
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,200
# She's languid #

1620
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,320
# Shh, quiet #

1621
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,800
# Bill? Bobby? Bruce? #

1622
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,640
# No, it's just
that I'm supine #

1623
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,600
That's a word?

1624
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,760
Who knows?

1625
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,280
# Physically,
I'm in pretty good shape #

1626
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,960
# See? She did
say it again #

1627
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,880
# But, mentally,
I'm comatose #

1628
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,560
# Quick, boy,
the dictionary #

1629
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,520
# You know you're
the only one I love #

1630
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,200
# New fish,
same hook #

1631
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,160
# Bye, now #

1632
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,080
# Bye, now #

1633
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,800
# She won't get up,
she won't go out #

1634
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,760
# Baby,
what's it all about? #

1635
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,920
# Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? #

1636
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,680
Well, in simple
English, I'm...

1637
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,080
# Lazy #

1638
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:30,120
# I wanna be #

1639
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,640
# Lazy #

1640
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,280
# I long to be #

1641
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,240
# Out in the sun #

1642
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:44,160
# With no work
to be done #

1643
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:48,920
# Under that awning #

1644
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:54,200
# They call the sky #

1645
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:59,840
# Stretching and yawning #

1646
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,160
# And let the world #

1647
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,600
# Go drifting by #

1648
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,920
# I wanna peep #

1649
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,800
# Through the deep #

1650
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,080
# Tangled wide world #

1651
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,440
# Counting sheep #

1652
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,640
# Till I sleep #

1653
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:29,200
# Like a child would #

1654
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:35,560
# With a great big
valise full #

1655
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,880
# Of books to read #

1656
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,360
# Where it's peaceful #

1657
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,840
# While I'm #

1658
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,800
# Killin' time #

1659
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,760
# Being lazy #

1660
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,160
Wrong number.

1661
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,560
Wrong number.

1662
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,200
Oh, Sam,
you're sweet.

1663
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,200
Aah!

1664
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,600
Lew, I did
that lyric over.

1665
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,040
You want to look at it?

1666
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,600
Oh, thanks, Charlie.

1667
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,480
That boy and girl are
just what Vicky needed.

1668
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,840
They make her look great.

1669
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,960
Yeah, they sure do.

1670
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,400
You know something, Lew?

1671
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,360
I think I'm gonna
marry that girl.

1672
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,520
You what?

1673
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,960
Don't get nervous.

1674
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,400
I mean
the little Donahue.

1675
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,400
Oh.

1676
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,720
# With a great big #

1677
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,920
# Valise full #

1678
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,000
# Of books to read #

1679
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:34,000
# Where it's peaceful #

1680
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,720
# While I'm #

1681
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,720
# Killin' time #

1682
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,600
# Being #

1683
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:50,320
# Lazy #

1684
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,400
That's fine, kids.
Very good. Keep it that way.

1685
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,360
Let's go to lunch.

1686
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,440
OK, kids, that's it.

1687
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,320
Lunch, everybody.
Back at 2:00 sharp.

1688
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,680
I'm starved.
I'll get my coat

1689
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,920
and be with you
in two minutes.

1690
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,880
All right.

1691
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,320
Tim, toward the finish

1692
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,320
where I slide over
the end of the couch,

1693
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,160
am I too close to you?

1694
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,120
Can the bee get too close
to the honey?

1695
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,120
Come on.
Let's go to lunch.

1696
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,120
Vicky, I have lunch
sent upstairs for us.

1697
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,920
I think that'll
be less tiring for you.

1698
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,000
We can't take
any chances

1699
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,080
with our star,
you know?

1700
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,480
Can I have
a rain check, Tim?

1701
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,440
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

1702
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,600
That dance looked great.

1703
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,800
Nice work, boy.

1704
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,040
Boy, you can
take me to lunch.

1705
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,760
Come on.

1706
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,880
Oh, by the way,
I fixed it.

1707
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,800
We've got Friday off.

1708
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,560
Yeah? Where are we going?

1709
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,520
To church.
Steve is being ordained.

1710
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,440
How could you
forget that?

1711
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,840
Honestly, Tim,
don't you think

1712
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,240
about anything these days
but Vicky Parker?

1713
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,200
No.

1714
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,440
Miss Donahue.

1715
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,400
Oh, hello.

1716
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,840
Excuse me.
I was just wondering

1717
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,160
if you were free
for lunch.

1718
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,680
Well, um...

1719
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,440
Oh, don't worry
about me, Sis.

1720
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,400
Of course,
I'm not sincere,

1721
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,800
but would you
like to join us?

1722
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,240
Well, thanks,
but I'll send out

1723
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,720
for a sandwich.
You go ahead.

1724
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,240
Be sure and eat, now.

1725
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,120
You really looked like you
were enjoying that number.

1726
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,560
I love it.

1727
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,160
But when I got up
to the altar,

1728
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,640
I was real scared.

1729
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,960
The ordaining was
so beautiful, Steve.

1730
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,160
Father Donahue.

1731
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,080
Hey, you know where
your parish will be?

1732
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,320
I haven't been
assigned yet.

1733
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,240
You make sure they give
you a good booking, son.

1734
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,240
Don't let them put you
out in the sticks.

1735
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,240
Oh, Charlie,
I'm sorry.

1736
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,160
Steve, you haven't
met Charlie Gibbs.

1737
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,560
Charlie, may I present
Father Steven Donahue?

1738
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,560
Glad to meet you,
Charlie.

1739
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,520
Congratulations,
Father.

1740
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,480
Thank you.

1741
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,920
Look, I know
this is family,

1742
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,400
and I kind of hate
to butt in,

1743
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,920
but I was wondering
if you'd have any time

1744
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,120
in the near future

1745
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,280
to perform a small
wedding ceremony.

1746
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,240
A wedding ceremony?

1747
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,200
That's right.

1748
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,720
Who are you
gonna marry, Charlie?

1749
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,440
You.

1750
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:33,440
What is this?

1751
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,560
When did
all this happen?

1752
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,000
It's the first
I've heard of it.

1753
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,360
It's the first I've
heard of it, too. Charlie.

1754
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,880
Well, it looks like it's
my turn to congratulate you.

1755
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,680
I'll be happy
to perform the ceremony.

1756
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,640
Thanks, Father.

1757
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,320
Wherever you are,
whenever you're ready,

1758
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,680
just give me a call.

1759
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,600
Have black suit,
will travel.

1760
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,240
I think I oughta
congratulate him, too.

1761
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,800
I'm gonna give
the bride away.

1762
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,000
Tim?

1763
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:00,960
Yeah. Ready?

1764
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,480
I have the evening
all planned.

1765
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,840
Dinner at Shambor.

1766
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,720
Pheasant under glass,
broccoli hollandaise.

1767
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,680
Not for me.

1768
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,720
I'm a simple girl
with simple tastes.

1769
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,280
2-inch-thick steaks,
French fries,

1770
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,240
and a big salad.

1771
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,120
Then steak it'll be.
Hitch on.

1772
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,040
Nellie, what is that?

1773
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,040
That's not for me.

1774
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,120
Well, yes, Miss Parker.

1775
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,600
It's the first dress
you wear.

1776
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,920
But I understood
it was out.

1777
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:23,880
Well, I don't know.

1778
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,920
Mr. Harris put it through.

1779
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,040
He wants to see it

1780
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,280
in his office right now.

1781
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,960
Then I have to see him
right now. Thanks, Millie.

1782
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,000
Hey, Vicky.

1783
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,600
Steak, French fries,
you and me, remember?

1784
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,600
You go ahead, Tim.

1785
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,680
I thought
I'd convinced Lew

1786
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,840
this dress
is wrong for me,

1787
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,760
but I guess I'll have
to persuade him again.

1788
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,720
It won't take long.

1789
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,880
I'll join you
at the restaurant.

1790
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,840
I'll give you
exactly 20 minutes.

1791
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,320
I'll be there just
as soon as I can.

1792
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,320
I promise.

1793
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,960
All right, honey,
but don't be long, huh?

1794
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,920
I won't.

1795
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,600
Night, Kelly.

1796
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,800
Good night.

1797
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,080
I still can't see

1798
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,400
anything wrong
with it.

1799
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,760
Lew, it's my first entrance.

1800
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,120
I have to make
an impression,

1801
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,560
and this dress
won't do it.

1802
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,400
This shade of purple
is wrong for me.

1803
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,440
The color is heliotrope.

1804
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,520
Heliotrope, hydrangea,
petunia,

1805
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,640
whatever you call it,

1806
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,400
it's still the wrong shade
of purple for me.

1807
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,840
Hey, kids,
simmer down.

1808
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,920
For two solid hours,

1809
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,160
I haven't been
a producer.

1810
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,600
I've been a referee.

1811
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,280
Lew, it's as simple
as this:

1812
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,080
Do you want me
to look right in this show?

1813
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,600
Everyone else thinks
it looks wonderful.

1814
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,440
She doesn't like it
because it's classic.

1815
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,880
In color, in line,

1816
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,320
in everything,
it's different.

1817
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,760
It's different, all right.

1818
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,480
Different from anything
I'm going to wear.

1819
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,560
Let's be practical.

1820
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,000
The dress cost $1,400,

1821
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,440
and that's not heliotrope.

1822
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,200
Yes?

1823
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,920
Oh. Just a minute.

1824
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,840
Did you have a date
with young Donahue?

1825
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,640
Poor Tim.
What time is it?

1826
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,600
Oh, no.

1827
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,080
Hello, Tim.

1828
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,680
I'm terribly sorry.

1829
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,640
It's taking longer
than I thought.

1830
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,200
Yes, I know, but--

1831
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,600
Look, why don't you
start your dinner?

1832
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,760
I won't be long.

1833
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,520
I will. Bye.

1834
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,800
- Now--
- Oh, now--

1835
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,480
4th round,
coming up.

1836
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,400
Oh, this whole argument's
ridiculous.

1837
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,680
Are we alive,
or are we dead?

1838
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,640
Just as I thought. Dead.

1839
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,760
Well, as long
as we're not on the air,

1840
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,200
I can speak freely.

1841
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,640
The time is now...

1842
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,720
12:31 A.M.

1843
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,360
It's tomorrow morning.

1844
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,760
First the news.

1845
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,800
The news is all bad,
so we'll skip it.

1846
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,240
Instead, we'll bring you

1847
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,640
the musical portion
of our program.

1848
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,200
I would like
to dedicate this number

1849
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,440
to a little girl who's
about to become a big star

1850
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,400
because she knows
exactly where she's going

1851
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,840
and who she's
going there with.

1852
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,920
<i>With whom
she's going there...</i>

1853
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,880
with?

1854
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,000
Anyway, I dedicate
this next number to her

1855
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,760
and to me, too, because...

1856
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,160
I ain't goin' there
with her.

1857
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,080
Well, hello,
Miss Vicky Parker.

1858
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,440
I'm terribly sorry, Tim.

1859
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,560
Speak up.

1860
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,040
I had no idea Geoffrey
was going to be there

1861
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,640
and that we would get
into such a big hassle.

1862
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,560
Oh, Geoffrey
was there, too?

1863
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,200
Well, well...
Geoffrey!

1864
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,800
Geoffrey. Geoffrey.
Here, Geoffrey.

1865
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,280
I don't see him.
Do you see him?

1866
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,360
However, just because
I can't see him

1867
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,120
doesn't mean
he wasn't there.

1868
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,040
Of course, I can't
see anything. No.

1869
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,800
Things can be right
in front of my nose,

1870
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,000
and I can't see them.

1871
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,040
What things?

1872
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,960
You want me
to spell it out for you?

1873
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,920
No.

1874
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,520
Maybe it's crazy to try and
explain anything to you

1875
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,440
the way you are now,

1876
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,120
but, Tim,
try to understand,

1877
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,920
to you, this is
just another show.

1878
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,360
You're part
of this business.

1879
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,880
You were born to it.

1880
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,280
You never had
to pound on doors

1881
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,600
to get people
to listen to you.

1882
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,520
Your family did it all.

1883
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,960
It's different with me.

1884
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,160
I've been on my own
since I was 15.

1885
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,240
This show is
my big chance.

1886
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,720
It's make or break.

1887
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,560
Don't worry, honey.
You'll make it.

1888
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,240
You've got what it takes,

1889
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,120
and you know
how to use it.

1890
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,960
I don't have to take
that from you, Tim.

1891
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,480
Why should I?

1892
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,120
I don't owe you a thing.

1893
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,040
That's right.
You don't.

1894
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,560
You only owe Lew Harris.

1895
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,000
You owe him everything.

1896
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,920
And let it not be said

1897
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,320
that you're a girl
who welches on her debts.

1898
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,280
Get out.

1899
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,960
Get out of here!

1900
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,640
Did you send
the flowers?

1901
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,880
Molly, for the 40th time,
yes, I sent the flowers.

1902
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,960
The florist said they'd
be at the theater by 7:30.

1903
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,120
And what about
the reservation

1904
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,240
at 21 for after the show?

1905
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,240
Yes, I made it, Molly.

1906
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,240
Now, will you calm down?

1907
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,400
You'd think it was
our opening night.

1908
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,520
I wish it was.
Those poor kids.

1909
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,400
Oh, just another show.
They'll be great.

1910
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,080
Hello.

1911
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,560
Hello?

1912
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,560
Katy?

1913
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,040
What's the matter,
honey?

1914
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,040
You sound
like you're crying.

1915
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,280
What? No. Where?

1916
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,240
Well, is he hurt bad?

1917
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,880
Who? Who's hurt?

1918
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,160
Was there anybody
with him?

1919
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,160
Oh, I see.

1920
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,120
Is it Tim?

1921
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,080
Yes, but he's
not hurt bad.

1922
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,200
He's just banged up
a little.

1923
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,880
Look, Katy, I'm gonna
go right out there.

1924
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,800
What hospital
did you say?

1925
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,240
Yeah, I got that.
Uh-huh.

1926
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,240
Now, look, honey...

1927
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,440
Now, you stop crying

1928
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,640
and get hold
of yourself,

1929
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:17,760
and I'll send Mother

1930
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,240
down to the theater
right away.

1931
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,320
Yes, I'm leaving
this minute. Right.

1932
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,280
All right, honey.
Good-bye.

1933
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,720
What is it?
What happened?

1934
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,840
He was with one
of the chorus girls,

1935
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,240
and the car
turned over.

1936
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,560
Katy said
he'd been drinking

1937
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,760
up in White Plains
somewhere.

1938
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,440
Are you sure
he's not badly hurt?

1939
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,720
Katy said no.

1940
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,560
What about the show tonight?
Why would Tim--

1941
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,560
Now, look, you get a cab
right away, will ya?

1942
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,600
Go to the theater.
Katy needs you.

1943
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,120
Will you call me
the minute you see him?

1944
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,440
Yes, I will,
and don't worry.

1945
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,400
Taxi. Taxi.

1946
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,520
We'll just have to
cut it, that's all.

1947
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,080
But you can't cut
that number, Lew.

1948
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,560
That's Katy's best spot
in the show.

1949
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,640
But, Mom, the understudy
can't do it like Tim.

1950
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,640
Wouldn't mean a thing.

1951
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,600
He can get away

1952
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,560
with some
of the routines,

1953
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,520
but not that number.

1954
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,480
I don't know.

1955
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,920
Maybe
the best thing to do

1956
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,040
would be
to postpone.

1957
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,840
Lew, why don't I
do it with her?

1958
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:06,960
You?

1959
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,520
Sure. I've been rehearsing
with her every night.

1960
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,480
I know it backwards.

1961
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,560
Oh, Molly, that's crazy.

1962
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,000
I'm telling you,
it'll work.

1963
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,120
I'll have to fake
the dancing,

1964
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,720
but I've been getting away
with that for years.

1965
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,440
You think you can
go out there cold

1966
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,680
and sell that number
with Katy?

1967
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,080
No, I'm just talking.
Of course I could.

1968
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,880
Why not, Lew? Why not?

1969
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:23,440
OK, Molly.
You're on.

1970
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,400
You're hired.

1971
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,280
Get the wardrobe
mistress up here.

1972
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,360
Charlie, take them
to the green room.

1973
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,480
I'll send
the orchestra leader

1974
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,440
right down.

1975
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,920
Me and my big mouth.

1976
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:31,880
All right, everybody,

1977
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,040
what are you standing
around here for?

1978
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,080
Let's go. We've got
a show to do.

1979
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,280
# I'm an old salt #

1980
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,040
# I'm a young salt #

1981
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,080
# In the navy #

1982
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,640
# We've been working
very hard #

1983
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,440
# I was part
of that flotilla #

1984
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,040
# With Dewey in Manila #

1985
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,360
# I'm a new recruit #

1986
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,080
# At the Brooklyn
Navy Yard #

1987
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:21,880
# Tonight we're on a spree
and feeling flowery #

1988
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,600
# We've got a date with gals
and drinks and food #

1989
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,280
# Across
the Brooklyn Bridge #

1990
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,800
# Into the bowery #

1991
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,200
# And I'm gonna get
the kid tattooed #

1992
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,720
Tattooed?

1993
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,120
Tattooed.

1994
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,200
# A sailor's
not a sailor #

1995
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,320
# Till a sailor's been #

1996
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:50,040
# Tattooed #

1997
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,040
# Here's an anchor #

1998
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,000
# From a tanker #

1999
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,360
# That I sailed upon #

2000
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,560
# When first
I went to sea #

2001
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,320
# Here's another #

2002
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,160
# Of my mother #

2003
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,960
# Takes me back to when
I sat upon her knee #

2004
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,640
# Here's a crimson heart #

2005
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,960
# With a cupid's dart #

2006
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,520
# Here's a battle cruiser #

2007
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,920
# And when
I sit down #

2008
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,760
# On that, too #

2009
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,400
# There's a tattoo #

2010
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,920
# Of my hometown #

2011
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,640
# To the bowery #

2012
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,400
# To the bowery #

2013
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,600
# Cross the Brooklyn Bridge #

2014
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,800
# And I'm just
in the mood #

2015
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,880
# He'll be filled
with different mixtures #

2016
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,320
# And covered up
with pictures #

2017
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,400
# I can't wait to be #

2018
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:37,640
# It'll be great
to be tattooed #

2019
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,360
# Tattooed #

2020
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,040
# Tattooed #

2021
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:44,400
# A sailor's not a sailor #

2022
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,960
# Till a sailor's been #

2023
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,680
# Ta-a-a-ttooed #

2024
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,080
# Tattooed #

2025
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,040
# Tattooed #

2026
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,000
# Tattooed #

2027
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,280
# Tattooed #

2028
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:10,240
# A sailor's not a sailor #

2029
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:16,040
# Till a sailor's
been tattooed #

2030
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,080
# Oh, a sailor's
not a sailor #

2031
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:38,360
# Till a sailor's
been tattooed #

2032
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,520
# Tattoo, tattoo #

2033
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,400
# A sailor's not a sailor #

2034
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,680
# Till he's been tattooed #

2035
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,200
# Tattooed #

2036
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,480
# Tattooed #

2037
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,440
# A sailor's not a sailor #

2038
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,480
# Till a sailor's been #

2039
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,080
# Tattooed #

2040
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,960
Hiya, Pop.

2041
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,520
How's the girl?

2042
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,960
She's all right,
I guess. Uh...

2043
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,560
they had to take
a couple of stitches,

2044
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,160
but the doctor said
none of them would show.

2045
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,120
How 'bout you?

2046
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,480
I'm all right.
They, uh...

2047
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,920
took a couple
of X-rays,

2048
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,320
just want me
to stay overnight

2049
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,400
for observation.

2050
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,640
All right, let's have it.
What happened?

2051
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,160
Didn't they
tell you downstairs?

2052
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,000
Yeah, they told me downstairs.
I'd like to hear it from you.

2053
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,640
OK, I was drunk.
I was loaded.

2054
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,600
The girl didn't like
the way I was driving,

2055
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,960
so she took the wheel,
and I passed out.

2056
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,760
Next thing I knew,
we were in a ditch,

2057
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,120
the car rolled over
a couple of times,

2058
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,760
and, uh...well, that's
about the whole story.

2059
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,960
Well, if you think
that's the whole story,

2060
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,040
you got even
less sense than--

2061
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,800
You know, I thought
you were just a kid

2062
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,440
who got out of line
a few times.

2063
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,040
But you're not a kid anymore.
You know the score.

2064
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,800
Have you any idea
what you pulled tonight?

2065
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,280
What do you mean,
it's opening night,

2066
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,720
the show must go on,
that routine?

2067
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,760
No, no. They'll get
the show on without you.

2068
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,600
You're not that important.

2069
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,800
You didn't hurt anybody
tonight but yourself.

2070
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,040
All right. So I had
the chance of a lifetime,

2071
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,120
and I blew it, so what?

2072
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,000
What's got into you?

2073
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,680
Who do you think you are?

2074
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,040
I'll tell you what you are.

2075
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,080
You're nothing, because
you've made yourself nothing,

2076
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,520
you conceited little punk.

2077
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,440
I wouldn't care if I
never saw you again.

2078
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,680
Oh, come on now, Pop.

2079
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,920
I heard there's a big
crop of corn this year,

2080
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,960
- but--
- What?

2081
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,680
Corn. H-A-M. Corn.

2082
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,920
Did you put in
a clean shirt?

2083
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,040
Yeah. I got
everything he needs.

2084
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,320
Now, remember, when we
get to the hospital,

2085
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,200
you promised me not
to be tough with him.

2086
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,680
He's just no good,
Mother.

2087
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,880
You should've
heard him last night.

2088
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:49,320
But it's not all his fault.

2089
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,080
I found out a lot
of things last night.

2090
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,720
That Parker girl's been
giving him a rough time.

2091
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,760
I knew she was
no good for him.

2092
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,640
You can blame the girl,
but everybody else blames him.

2093
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,080
Are you gonna tell him

2094
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,960
that they want you
to stay in the show?

2095
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,920
Sure. It'll only
be a few days.

2096
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,920
It's down here.

2097
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,320
Oh.

2098
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,480
Can I help you?

2099
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,160
I'm Mr. Donahue.
My son is in 4--

2100
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,120
Oh! I--

2101
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,240
Is there
something wrong?

2102
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,760
Your son isn't here.

2103
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,800
He seems to have picked
himself up last night

2104
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,800
and walked out.

2105
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,280
He left this note
for you.

2106
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,360
Thank you.

2107
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,200
"Dear folks,

2108
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,080
"I'm sorry I gave you
such a bad time.

2109
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,160
"I think Pop was right.

2110
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,640
"You'll all be
better off without me.

2111
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,040
"See you around
sometime.

2112
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,400
"Don't worry.

2113
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,920
Love, Tim."

2114
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,880
"Don't worry." Ha.

2115
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,120
That's a laugh.

2116
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,040
You start worrying
about your kids

2117
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,000
the day they're born,
and you never stop.

2118
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,920
Even after they bury you,
I bet you never stop.

2119
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,480
Of course
we did everything

2120
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,680
we possibly could
to find him.

2121
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,120
Went to the police.

2122
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,440
Checked booking offices,
in case he tried to work.

2123
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,760
Even hired detectives
of our own.

2124
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,280
Once, later on,

2125
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,560
we heard he was working
under a different name

2126
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:37,040
with a trio down
in Greenwich Village.

2127
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,840
# Oh, Marie #

2128
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,320
# Time for sleepin'
is done #

2129
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,600
# The dawn is breaking #

2130
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,400
# Take a peek
at that sun #

2131
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,840
# Sweet Marie #

2132
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,160
# Better open
your eyes #

2133
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,320
# You'll soon be awake #

2134
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,360
# Now's the time
to arise #

2135
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,560
# Oh, Marie #

2136
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:59,320
# My broken heart #

2137
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,280
# My heart is #

2138
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:04,120
# Aching for you #

2139
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,520
# For you #

2140
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:10,920
# My sweet
Ma-Ma-Marie #

2141
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,800
Every place
you went those days,

2142
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,400
you saw more
and more uniforms.

2143
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,640
Half the world
was fighting already,

2144
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,360
and the other half was
rehearsing to get into it.

2145
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,920
Even Steve had applied
to go over as a chaplain.

2146
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,040
Better wait under here,
Miss Parker.

2147
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,480
I'll only be a minute.

2148
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,920
Thanks, Kelly.

2149
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,600
Oh, uh...Kelly's
getting me a cab.

2150
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,000
May I drop you
someplace?

2151
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,120
No, thank you.

2152
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:04,040
I just thought it would
give us a chance to--

2153
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,000
Oh, that's quite all right.
There are plenty of cabs.

2154
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,200
I'll find one.

2155
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,600
All ready?

2156
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,880
I changed my mind,
Molly. I'm not going.

2157
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,160
Aw, come on, Terry.

2158
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,760
You can drop me off
at the theater

2159
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,360
and then go over
The Lamb's Club

2160
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,600
and have a few laughs.

2161
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,560
And then I'll pick you up
after the show.

2162
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,560
We can take in
a midnight movie, hmm?

2163
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,880
Thanks, Molly.
I'm just not up to it.

2164
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:32,880
OK.

2165
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,640
See you later.

2166
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,000
Oh, uh, Terry,

2167
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,400
I came across
some old arrangements,

2168
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,000
the stuff we used to do
with the kids.

2169
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,400
Let's go over them
tomorrow, huh?

2170
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,440
What for?

2171
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,120
Well, the actor's fund's
having a benefit

2172
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,880
on the 19th.
I told you about it.

2173
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:49,960
They're tearing down
the Hippodrome,

2174
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,400
and they're trying
to get together

2175
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,800
some of the old acts
that played there.

2176
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,920
I'm a pretty old act.

2177
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,320
Maybe they better
tear me down, too.

2178
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,720
But they want us
to be in the show.

2179
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,680
You're kiddin', Molly.

2180
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,440
You know I couldn't
go out on a stage.

2181
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:00,680
I haven't done
an act since--

2182
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,120
Oh, Terry will you stop
talking this way?

2183
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,280
It's not gonna help anything.

2184
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,000
What are you gonna do,
spend the rest of your life

2185
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,880
moping around like this,
blaming yourself?

2186
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,120
Look, I miss him, too.
Every day. Every minute.

2187
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,560
But at least I keep goin'.

2188
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,440
How do you think I feel
goin' on every night,

2189
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:13,480
working with that girl?

2190
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,480
Oh, Molly.

2191
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,400
Come on, you're going
into town with me.

2192
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,840
Why? So we can
walk down Broadway,

2193
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,320
and you can look
into the face

2194
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:20,800
of every young kid
that goes by?

2195
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,760
Terry, please.

2196
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,800
Oh, Molly,
for Pete's sake,

2197
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:23,920
will you stop
nagging me?

2198
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,360
I said I'm not going,
and I'm not.

2199
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,800
And that benefit
on the 19th,

2200
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,200
just figure
to play it yourself

2201
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,320
because I won't be here.

2202
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,320
Why? Where you going?

2203
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,440
I'm gonna go find him.

2204
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,920
Where? How do you know
where to look?

2205
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,360
I don't. But I can't
sit around here

2206
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,320
any longer, Molly.

2207
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,760
I got to do
something. I--

2208
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,720
Terry, I'll be late
if I don't go now.

2209
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,200
Promise me you won't
do anything crazy.

2210
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:42,080
We can talk about it
when I get home.

2211
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:44,240
I'll be early. I'll skip
the curtain call, OK?

2212
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,280
Sure, Molly.

2213
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,960
# I'll grab him
by the collar #

2214
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,200
# And I'll holler #

2215
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,160
- # Ala #
- # Bam' #

2216
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,400
Hi.

2217
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,640
Well, hello,
Molly darling.

2218
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,640
Bobby!

2219
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,920
Hello, Molly! Heh heh!

2220
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,160
- Oh, Mrs. Donahue.
- Yes?

2221
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,840
You and your daughter
are in, uh, 12-A.

2222
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,240
Up these stairs
to your left.

2223
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,200
Thanks.

2224
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,520
I'll hang your dress up
back here.

2225
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,720
Thanks, Katy.

2226
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,960
Now, look,
when she gets here,

2227
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,160
let me get things started.

2228
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,360
I know how to handle her.

2229
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:30,520
OK. But you know
how many times

2230
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:31,880
I've tried
at the theater.

2231
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,840
She just won't
listen to me.

2232
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,120
Oh, hi, Mom.
Come on in.

2233
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,800
Here, I'll take that.

2234
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,160
It's a little crowded
in here, isn't it?

2235
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,520
No. You'll have
loads of room.

2236
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:42,480
I've moved upstairs.

2237
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,640
You and Vicky
are sharing.

2238
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,680
Oh, are we?

2239
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,120
Well, if it's all
the same to you,

2240
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,560
I'll dress in the powder room
or someplace.

2241
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,280
You'll do nothing
of the kind.

2242
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:50,280
I told you
it wouldn't work.

2243
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,600
It'll work.
It'll work.

2244
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,920
Probably won't,
but I'm curious.

2245
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
What is it?

2246
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,960
Mom, I think you
owe Vicky an apology.

2247
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:56,920
What?

2248
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,560
This isn't my idea,
Mrs. Donahue.

2249
01:41:58,640 --> 01:41:59,880
No, it isn't.
It's mine.

2250
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,000
I think it's high time

2251
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,480
you two got things
straightened out.

2252
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,960
Ooh, so that's the plot.

2253
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:04,960
Apparently, my daughter--

2254
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,120
<i>You are my daughter,</i>

2255
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,280
aren't you, Mrs. Gibbs?

2256
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,240
I think so.

2257
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,680
Apparently,
my daughter has the idea

2258
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,600
that you and I
ought to be friends.

2259
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,040
Do you mind if I ask her

2260
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,480
what she thinks
we have in common?

2261
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,680
It's very simple.
You both love Tim.

2262
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,280
Oh, I see.

2263
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,400
Aren't you a little late?

2264
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,160
I might be.
I hope not.

2265
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:26,040
Mom, I'm crazy
about you, but...

2266
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,480
but you're stubborn,
and you're awfully tough.

2267
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,440
You can't go on
blaming Vicky.

2268
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,000
It was really Tim's fault.

2269
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,360
He did this whole thing
to himself.

2270
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,560
I was around. I saw it.

2271
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,880
You've gotta hear
her side of it.

2272
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,080
I'm getting out of here.

2273
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,040
The doctor said
I shouldn't get excited,

2274
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,080
and I'm all worked up.

2275
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,320
Be a little easy,
will you, Mom?

2276
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:51,160
Maybe I am tough and
stubborn, Miss Parker,

2277
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:54,360
but from where I sit,
it's pretty hard to believe

2278
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,680
that you're really
in love with Tim.

2279
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,800
I don't know how
to convince you,

2280
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,920
but it's true.

2281
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,800
Then fit Lew Harris
into this pretty picture,

2282
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:02,880
will you?

2283
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,600
Lew did everything for me.
You know that.

2284
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,360
Maybe he did
have some ideas.

2285
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,600
It doesn't mean
that I shared them.

2286
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,120
There was never anyone
for me but Tim.

2287
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,800
Too bad you didn't
let him know.

2288
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,560
I tried to,
Mrs. Donahue,

2289
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,440
but he was
pretty stubborn, too.

2290
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:20,680
Come in.

2291
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,000
Steve! Steve!

2292
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,160
Mom!

2293
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,480
Mom!

2294
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,440
Oh, it's so good
to see you!

2295
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,760
You look wonderful,
Father Donahue!

2296
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,960
Thin, but wonderful.

2297
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,160
Oh, excuse me.

2298
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,320
This is Tim's brother
Father Donahue.

2299
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,840
Steve, Vicky Parker.

2300
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,200
How do you do,
Miss Parker?

2301
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,920
I'm glad
to know you, Father.

2302
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,920
Tim used to talk
about you a lot.

2303
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,440
He was very proud
of you.

2304
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,040
Thank you. He talked
a lot about you, too.

2305
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:49,160
That's nice.

2306
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,520
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

2307
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,680
I'll find out where
they have me spotted

2308
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,640
in the show.

2309
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:57,720
Oh, Vicky.
Will you do me a favor?

2310
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,040
If you see Katy,

2311
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,960
tell her that her mother
isn't stubborn.

2312
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
It might take her
two or three years

2313
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,760
to change her mind,

2314
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,560
but she's not stubborn.

2315
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:09,760
Thanks, Mrs. Donahue.

2316
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,120
See you later.

2317
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,360
So that's the girl?

2318
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,840
Yeah. Nice girl, too.

2319
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,680
Your mom was
wrong again. Ha.

2320
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,920
Why didn't you let us
know you were coming?

2321
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,360
Mom, I didn't know
myself.

2322
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,400
The whole regiment

2323
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,240
was just handed
a 24-hour pass.

2324
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,680
Now, I knew
by the papers

2325
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,120
that you're doing
a show here, so--

2326
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,560
A 24-hour pass?
Does that mean that--

2327
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:32,000
It means a 24-hour pass.

2328
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,640
Don't you double-talk me,
Steve Donahue.

2329
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,400
Mom, I'm not supposed
to say any more.

2330
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,840
Besides, I don't know
any more.

2331
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,360
Say, shouldn't you
be getting ready?

2332
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,200
Oh, I'm all made up.

2333
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,480
Just have
to put my dress on.

2334
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,760
Only be a minute.

2335
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,920
Is, uh...

2336
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,320
Pop back?

2337
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,840
No.

2338
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:52,880
How did you know?

2339
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,320
Katy wrote me.

2340
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,240
I wish
there was some way

2341
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,520
we could help him.

2342
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,960
Yeah. Did, uh,
Katy also write you

2343
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,920
that you're
gonna be an uncle?

2344
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,240
Yeah. Isn't that great?

2345
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,520
She booked me
for the christening.

2346
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,000
At least she and Charlie
are happy.

2347
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,280
Any news about Tim?

2348
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:13,440
Not a word.

2349
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,680
It's over a year, Steve.

2350
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,800
Even the detectives
have given up.

2351
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,400
I still believe
he'll be back, Mom.

2352
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,480
I'm not so sure.

2353
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,680
Sometimes I think we'll...
never see him again.

2354
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:31,680
Mom...

2355
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,160
don't lose faith.

2356
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,520
I don't always
think that, Steve.

2357
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,160
Just sometimes.

2358
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,400
You're on next,
Mrs. Donahue. Five minutes.

2359
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:44,680
Be right with you.

2360
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,280
You wanna watch
from the wings?

2361
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,720
Yeah. That'll be great.

2362
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,120
OK, I'll fix it.

2363
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,600
# There's no business
like show business #

2364
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:25,320
# Like no business I know #

2365
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:28,720
# Everything about it
is appealing #

2366
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,200
# Everything the traffic
will allow #

2367
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:35,040
# Nowhere could you get
that happy feeling #

2368
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,760
# When you are stealing
that extra bow #

2369
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,400
# There's no people
like show people #

2370
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,040
# They smile
when they are low #

2371
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,320
# Yesterday they told you
you would not go far #

2372
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:51,040
# That night you open #

2373
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,920
# And there you are #

2374
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,680
# Next day,
on your dressing room #

2375
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,400
# They've hung a star #

2376
01:46:56,480 --> 01:47:01,920
# Let's go
on with the show #

2377
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,840
# The costumes,
the scenery #

2378
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,600
# The makeup, the props #

2379
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:09,240
# The audience that lifts you
when you're down #

2380
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,720
# The headaches,
the heartaches #

2381
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,520
# The backaches, the flops #

2382
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:16,600
# The sheriff who escorts you
out of town #

2383
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:18,560
# The opening
when your heart beats #

2384
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,160
# Like a drum #

2385
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,440
# The closing #

2386
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:29,120
# When the customers
don't come #

2387
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,040
# There's #

2388
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:34,000
# No business
like show business #

2389
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:37,480
# Like no business I know #

2390
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,880
# You get word
before the show has started #

2391
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,000
# That your favorite uncle
died at dawn #

2392
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:47,000
# On top of that,
your pa and ma have parted #

2393
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,760
# You're broken-hearted #

2394
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,640
# But you go on #

2395
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:54,240
# There's no people
like show people #

2396
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,760
# They smile
when they are low #

2397
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:57,760
Mom.

2398
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,200
# Even with a turkey #

2399
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,240
# That you know will fold #

2400
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:04,760
# You may be stranded
out in the cold #

2401
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,120
# Still you wouldn't
change it #

2402
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,840
# For a sack of gold #

2403
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,000
# Let's go
on with the show #

2404
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,320
# Let's go #

2405
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:18,920
# On with the #

2406
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,600
# Show #

2407
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,000
Tim!

2408
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,280
Darling!

2409
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,400
Oh, why did you
do it, Tim, why?

2410
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:34,920
Well, I had to, Mom.

2411
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,120
I had to work things
out for myself.

2412
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,080
Oh!

2413
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,040
Where's Pop?

2414
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:42,680
Oh, he's...he's...

2415
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,560
Here, son.

2416
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:46,880
Terry!

2417
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:00,760
Hello, Pop.

2418
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:03,960
Oh, Tim.

2419
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,720
Oh, Terry!

2420
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,080
Hi, Molly.

2421
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,800
Will you look
at the woman?

2422
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,840
You'd think I was the
one who'd been lost.

2423
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,960
Please, Mrs. Donahue.
We're dead out there.

2424
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,720
You're supposed to lead us
into the big number.

2425
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:18,960
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

2426
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,360
I'll be right with you.

2427
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,640
Somebody give me
their handkerchief.

2428
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:22,840
Here. I got one.

2429
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,600
All right, now,
you all hold it.

2430
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,080
I'll take care of this.

2431
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,080
Just stand back.

2432
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

2433
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,280
first I want to thank you
for being so patient.

2434
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,480
My wife got
just a little excited.

2435
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:38,920
You see, the last time

2436
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,600
we played
this wonderful old theater

2437
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,920
was the last time
that The Five Donahues

2438
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,360
appeared together
as an act.

2439
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:45,320
Well, after that,

2440
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:46,800
lots of things happened, and...

2441
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:49,160
well, that's just the way
it was until...

2442
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,120
just now, backstage
when The Five Donahues

2443
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,200
got together again.

2444
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,800
And because we're
kind of sentimental

2445
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,040
about this old theater,

2446
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:56,640
we'd like to do
a little bit of

2447
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,920
<i>Alexander's
Ragtime Band,</i>

2448
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,360
the number we did
when we played here.

2449
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,560
Thank you.

2450
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:03,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Five Donahues.

2451
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,200
# Come on and hear,
come on and hear #

# It's the best band
in the land #

2455
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:26,200
<i># And if you care
to hear the Swanee River #</i>

2456
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,200
# Played in ragtime #

2457
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,200

# Alexander's Ragtime #

2459

# Ragtime Band #

# There's no business
like show business #

2464
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,920
# There's no business #

2465
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,840
# That's half so thrilling #

2466
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:51,960
# The cowboys, the tumblers,
the wrestlers, the clowns #

2467
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:55,120
# The roustabouts
that move the show at dawn #

2468
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:58,560
# The music, the spotlights,
the people, the towns #

2469
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:01,400
# The thrill of that applause
when you go on #

2470
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,880
# You're standing out in front
on opening nights #

2471
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,960
# And there's your billing
right up there in lights #

2472
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:11,400
# There's no people
like show people #

2473
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,800
# They smile
when they are low #

# Everything about it
is appealing #

2482

# Everything the traffic
will allow #

2483

# Nowhere can you get
that happy feeling #

2484
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:46,080
# When you are stealing
that extra bow #

2485
