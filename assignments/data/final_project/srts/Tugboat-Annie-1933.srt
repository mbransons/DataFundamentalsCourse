HEY, MOM!

3
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,400
WHAT IS IT, SON?

4
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:11,734
LISTEN. IF A FISH
WEIGHS 10 POUNDS

5
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,601
AND HIS BODY WEIGHS
TWICE AS MUCH AS HIS HEAD

6
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,234
AND HIS HEAD WEIGHS
TWICE AS MUCH AS HIS TAIL,

7
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,133
HOW MUCH WOULD
HIS TAIL WEIGH?

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,434
HOW DO I KNOW?

9
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:26,000
SAY, YOU GO ON WITH YOUR LESSONS
AND STOP ASKING ME RIDDLES.

10
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,601
IT AIN'T A RIDDLE.

11
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,100
THAT'S MY ALGEBRA.

12
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,634
AW, IT'S TOO HARD.
I CAN'T GET IT!

13
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,467
STOP TALKING LIKE THAT!

14
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,467
SAY, LISTEN.

15
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,767
IF YOU'RE GONNA GIVE UP AS EASY AS THAT,

16
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,934
YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA AMOUNT TO NOTHING.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,267
DON'T YOU WANT
TO BE A SUCCESS?

18
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:49,534
SURE, BUT... BUT CAN'T
A FELLA BE A SUCCESS

19
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:52,534
WITHOUT KNOWING HOW MUCH
A FISH'S TAIL WEIGHS?

20
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:56,567
HMM! CAN'T LEARN NOTHING
FROM A FISH'S TAIL.

21
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:58,400
HA! FISH'S TAIL.

22
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,467
HERE. GIVE ME

WHY CAN'T I HAVE

BECAUSE I AIN'T GOT

102
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:36,067
HUH! THE OLD NARCISSUS AIN'T

MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME?

116

CACKLES UP THE WRONG PANTS LEG.

AIN'T BEEN GNAWING ON THIS HAWSER?

WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO THE HAWSER?

141
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,434
YOU...

142
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,167
OH!

143
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:28,434
HEY! SHE LOST
THE TOW.

144
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,100
GOT THAT SHOT LINE
READY?

145
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,901
ALL SET, RED.

146
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,634
NEVER MIND, MOM.

147
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:48,734
MIND? HMM!

148
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,567
WHY SHOULD
I MIND?

149
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:55,434
WASN'T SUCH A BIG-PAYING JOB NOHOW.

150
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,701
BABOON!

151
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,234
THAT'S THE THIRD JOB
WE'VE LOST THIS WEEK.

152
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,901
MOM, I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL NEXT YEAR.

153
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,367
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

154
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,234
OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

155
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,033
HMM! YOU AIN'T
GONNA BE A QUITTER.

156
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,501
NO, BUT POP'S ALWAYS
DOING THINGS LIKE THAT,

157
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,601
AND IF HE WON'T LOOK
AFTER YOU, WELL-

158
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,067
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

159
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,534
YOUR POP LOOKS
AFTER ME ALL RIGHT.

160
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:23,734
WHY, HE'S THE FINEST, BIGGEST
HUSBAND A WOMAN EVER HAD,

161
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,601
CUSS HIM.

162
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,133
SAY-HA HA!

163
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,567
I ONLY HOPE YOU'RE HALF
AS GOOD A SAILOR AS HE IS

164
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,334
WHEN YOU GROW UP.

165
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,100
TOUGH LUCK, ANNIE.

166
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,067
OH, IT'S ALL
IN THE DAY.

167
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,834
ALL RIGHT, PETE.

168
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,400
MOM?

169
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,400
HMM?

170
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,801
WE GOT TO TALK
THIS THING OVER.

171
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:54,734
I'M NOT GOING
BACK TO SCHOOL.

172
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,567
OH, OF COURSE YOU'RE
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

173
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:59,934
YOU GOT TO GET
ED-I-CATED. HMM!

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,167
TUGBOAT'S NO PLACE FOR A BOY WHO
WANTS TO BE CAPTAIN OF A BIG LINER.

175
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:08,200
SAY, SUPPOSE YOU WAS
CAPTAIN OF A BIG LINER

176
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:11,234
AND SOME SWELL PEOPLE
WOULD COME ABOARD,

177
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,400
LIKE A PROFESSOR OR A BANK
PRESIDENT OR A CORONER,

178
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,868
AND THEY SHOULD TALK
TO YOU IN...IN LATIN,

179
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:21,033
AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT
THEY WAS TALKING ABOUT.

180
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,968
WHY, THAT'D BE TERRIBLE.

181
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,501
THEY MIGHT
ASK YOU TO HAVE

182
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,234
SOME PATTY FOZE GRAZ (PÖTÉ DE
FOIE GRAS) OR CAVIOX (CAVIAR)

183
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,534
OR SOMETHING, AND YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW WHAT THEY WAS SAYING.

184
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:32,400
HMM! OH, NO. YOU GOT
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

185
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,300
BUT, MOM,
DON'T YOU SEE-

186
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:38,567
YOU KNOW, YOUR PAPA AND ME IS
GONNA BUST WIDE-OPEN WITH PRIDE

187
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:42,601
THE DAY WE SEE YOU GO
KERSLOPPING PAST THE OLD NARCISSUS

188
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,467
ON THE BRIDGE
OF YOUR OWN LINER.

189
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:46,601
HA HA HA! OOH!

190
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,901
BET YOU EVEN TRY TO RUN
US DOWN, YOU BIG SMARTY.

191
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:51,767
HA HA HA! HMM.

192
00:12:55,801 --> 00:13:00,067
ALEC BRENNAN,
MASTER MARINER.

193
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,868
THERE SHE IS!
WHERE?

194
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,067
OH, THERE SHE IS!

195
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,033
OW! OH!

196
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,234
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

197
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,868
YOU'RE ON MY FOOT,
YOU BIG OX.

198
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,033
OH. OH, LOOK.
LOOK!

199
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,100
HA HA!

200
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:40,934
THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR
US BRENNANS, AIN'T IT?

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,934
OH! OH, GO ON AWAY,
YOU BIG APE.

202
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,734
HA HA! KISS LIKE
A WET PAINTBRUSH.

203
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:52,334
SAY, KISSING ME
- PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.

204
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,901
WHO, ME?

205
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,634
OHH! NOW, IS THAT
A NICE THING TO SAY

206
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,834
ABOUT A MAN WHO AIN'T
HAD A DRINK IN 5 WEEKS?

207
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:03,367
ALEC WILL BE THAT PROUD.

208
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:07,767
WAIT UNTIL HE HEARS THAT I AIN'T GONNA
TAKE ANOTHER DRINK AS LONG AS I LIVE.

209
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:11,167
YOU KNOW, IT TAKES A BIG MAN
TO STOP COLD JUST LIKE THAT.

210
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:12,767
AIN'T IT THE TRUTH?

211
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:15,334
GO ON, HUSTLE. PUT ON A CLEAN
SHIRT AND YOUR OTHER PANTS.

212
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,667
OH, NO, ANNIE. THIS IS
ALL RIGHT. I DON'T WANT-

213
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,400
GO ON, NOW.
DO AS I TELL YOU.

214
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,934
OH...

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,567
WHEN YOU'RE DRESSED UP, THERE
AIN'T NO HOOLIGAN ON THE WATERFRONT

216
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:26,234
LOOKS AS GRAND
AS YOU DO.

217
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,267
SAY, MANY'S THE TIME
I'VE HEARD ALEC SAY,

218
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,400
"WHEN POP'S
IN HIS SUNDAY BEST,

219
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:34,000
YOU COULD ALMOST
MISTAKE HIM FOR A GENT."

220
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,834
HE ALWAYS WAS A BOY
TO TAKE NOTICE. YEAH.

221
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,234
YEAH.

222
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,067
BUT WE GOT TO
DO HIM UP PROUD,

223
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,467
SHOW HIM WHERE HE GETS
HIS GOOD LOOKS FROM, HUH?

224
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:45,701
AND ME ON THE WATER WAGON. HOT DOGGIE!

225
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:48,200
GO ON. GO ON.
GET ALL SPROUSED UP,

226
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:53,534
AND DON'T TALK
SO MUCH ABOUT IT.

227
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,133
I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT
YOUR FATHER'S GOING TO SAY.

228
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,067
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE
PATRICIA SEVERN AND-

229
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,067
AND MY FATHER WILL PROBABLY
THANK HIS LUCKY STARS

230
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,234
THAT IF HIS PRECIOUS
DAUGHTER HAD TO FALL IN LOVE,

231
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,901
SHE'D PICK
THE CRACK CAPTAIN

232
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:52,200
OF HIS WHOLE
DARN STEAMSHIP LINE.

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,501
THAT'S PROBABLY MOTHER.

234
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,167
SHE'S COMING UP
THE SOUND TO MEET ME.

235
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,701
DOESN'T SOUND MUCH LIKE
HER VOICE AS I REMEMBER IT.

236
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,267
HA HA! SILLY.

237
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,567
SHE'S A GRAND PERSON,
ISN'T SHE, ALEC?

238
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:06,367
THEY DON'T COME
ANY BETTER.

239
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:09,167
I WANT TO MAKE THINGS EASIER
FOR HER NOW THAT I CAN.

240
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:13,033
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET, BUT DOCKING
MY SHIP TODAY IS HER LAST JOB.

241
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,367
COME ON OUT,
AND WE'LL WHISTLE HELLO.

242
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,601
ALL RIGHT.

243
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,734
ALEC BRENNAN,
MASTER MARINER.

244
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:55,868
STAND BY TO HEAVE THE LINE,
PETE, WHEN I BRING HER ABOUT.

245
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,834
NICE WORK, EH?

246
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:59,534
YOU BET.

247
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,133
WHAT A BOAT,
ANNIE!

248
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,868
TAKE THE WHEEL, SHIF'LESS.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM!

249
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:10,667
AYE, AYE, SKIPPER.

250
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:32,667
I DON'T SEE MY FATHER.

251
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,601
HEY, TERRY,
ANNIE SAYS HURRY UP.

252
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:26,734
I'M LOOKING
FOR MY HAT.

253
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:28,601
LOST MY HAT.

254
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:40,400
TERRY!

255
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:41,934
TERRY?

256
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,934
TERRY!

257
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,167
WHERE ARE YOU?

258
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:47,667
HUH?

259
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:54,501
TERRY...YOU'RE DRUNK.

260
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,634
ANNIE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

261
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,400
AS MAYOR OF SECOMA

262
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:52,434
AND SPEAKING FOR THE THOUSANDS
OF APPRECIATIVE CITIZENS

263
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:53,934
OF OUR GREAT COMMONWEALTH,

264
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,334
I AM INDEED PROUD TO WELCOME
THE BEAUTIFUL GLACIER QUEEN,

265
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,901
FLAGSHIP OF
THE SEVERN LINE, TO...

266
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:07,901
NOW, THEN, STAND BACK!
NO SHOVING!

267
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:09,567
WELL, ANNIE!

268
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:12,334
WELL, IF THE BOY'S OWN
MOTHER AIN'T GOT THE RIGHT-

269
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,467
COME RIGHT THROUGH HERE.
STAND ASIDE THERE!

270
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:18,400
IT IS ALSO
OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO HONOR

271
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:21,400
TO A BOY WHO GREW UP
FROM CHILDHOOD

272
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,968
RIGHT HERE
ON OUR WATERFRONT,

273
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:27,133
A HOMEGROWN
PRODUCT OF SECOMA

274
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,033
AND WHOM SECOMA
MAY BE WELL PROUD OF

275
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,901
AS THE YOUNGEST CAPTAIN THAT
EVER SAILED THESE WATERS-

276
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:38,334
CAPTAIN ALEC BRENNAN!

277
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,234
I, UH...

278
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,868
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

279
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:59,834
IT...IT'S ALL SO UNEXPECTED
AND MOST EMBARRASSING.

280
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:03,934
OF COURSE, A SHIP'S MASTER
IS AN UNIMPORTANT COG-

281
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,667
COG! OH,
HE AIN'T NO COG!

282
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:07,734
MOM!

283
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,033
ALEC!

284
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:14,868
OH, ALEC!

285
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,067
OH, MOM!

286
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,434
YOU KNOW, HE ALWAYS
WAS BASHFUL.

287
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:21,367
THIS IS MY MOTHER
MRS. BRENNAN, SIR.

288
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,501
HOW DO YOU DO,
MA'AM?

289
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,067
HOW DO YOU DO,
YOUR HONOR?

290
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:26,167
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD
OF YOUR SON.

291
00:23:26,234 --> 00:23:27,601
AM I? HA!

292
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,734
THERE AIN'T A BETTER CAPTAIN
BETWEEN VANCOUVER AND SAN PEDRO!

293
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,901
BARRING HIS FATHER.

294
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:36,067
OH, HELLO, RED,

295
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,067
YOU OLD PINK-EYED
SNOOZER, YOU!

296
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,267
MOM!

297
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,067
OH, ME AND HIM'S
OLD FRIENDS.

298
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,701
ONLY SEEMS
LIKE YESTERDAY

299
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:45,767
WE'RE FIGHTING EACH
OTHER FOR BUSINESS,

300
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,501
HIM ON HIS TUG
AND ME ON MINE.

301
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,000
GLAD TO
SEE YOU, ANNIE.

302
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:51,968
THANK YOU, RED!
HA HA!

303
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,701
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. BRENNAN?

304
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,434
OH, MY, OH, MY!
IF YOU AIN'T GROWED UP

305
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,701
TO BE AS PRETTY
AS A PICTURE!

306
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:03,033
ENOUGH BEAUS, I BET,
TO MAKE A STANDING ARMY.

307
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,868
NO ARMY FOR ME,
MRS. BRENNAN.

308
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:07,033
I'M TERRIBLY PARTIAL
TO THE FLEET.

309
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,000
WHERE'S TERRY?

310
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,033
TER-UH...OH...
HA HA!

311
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,267
TERRY? OH, YOU KNOW HE WAS
SO FILLED FULL OF EN-THOO-SISM

312
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:17,567
THAT HE FORGOT THERE WAS A LADDER
FROM THE WHEELHOUSE TO THE DECK,

313
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,934
AND HE BRAVELY SUFFERED
THE SPRAIN OF A LEG,

314
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,334
BUT-BUT, UM,
HE SENT HIS REGARDS,

315
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,734
AND HE HOPES THAT
YOU AND YOUR HONOR

316
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:29,667
WILL COME DOWN TO THE TUG
AND HAVE MESS OF TEA SOMETIME.

317
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,467
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, ANNIE.

318
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:33,868
I HOPE THAT INVITATION
INCLUDED ME, MRS. BRENNAN.

319
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,234
IT DID.

320
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,567
WHEN CAN I COME?

321
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:38,400
OH, AIN'T YOU
THE NICE GIRL!

322
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,601
WE THINK SO.

323
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,701
HOW ABOUT
TOMORROW NIGHT?

324
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:44,534
YOU CAN COME DOWN AND HAVE
SUPPER ON THE NARCISSUS.

325
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:47,567
SAY, I PROMISE YOU AS
FINE A MESS OF SAUERKRAUT

326
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,467
AS EVER YOU HEAVED
BELOW HATCHES.

327
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:51,567
WILL MR. BRENNAN BE
ALL RIGHT BY THEN?

328
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:55,033
OH, YEAH...
OH, YES, HE'LL BE ALL-

329
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,167
IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY
CONCUSSION, YOU KNOW.

330
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:59,567
OH, OF COURSE,
FOR THE PRESENT,

331
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,367
HE'S CONFIDED
TO HIS CABIN.

332
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,601
BUT HE'LL
BE ALL RIGHT.

333
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,501
YOU KNOW, THE STRAIN
AND THE FALLING...

334
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,734
OF THE STRAIN...

335
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:32,467
PHEW!

336
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,367
CHOW?

337
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,534
YEAH?

338
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,367
WHERE'S THAT
RUM FLAVORING?

339
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,067
HERE,
MRS. BRENNAN.

340
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:18,834
WE'LL JUST PUT THAT AWAY SO MR. TERRY
WON'T MAKE ANY FOXY PAWS (FAUX PAS).

341
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,467
YOU KNOW, CHOW, SOMEDAY HE'S
GONNA TAKE A DRINK OF WATER

342
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:31,000
THINKING IT'S GIN, AND
HE'S GONNA DIE OF THE SHOCK.

343
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,334
HA HA HA!
OH, DEAR.

344
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,167
HUH! OH, MY.

345
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:35,300
TERRY!

346
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:36,467
TERRY?

347
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:38,868
WHOO-HOO!

348
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,734
SAY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

349
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:46,734
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO?

350
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:51,534
AW, I WAS JUST LOOKING TO SEE
IF THERE'S ANY WORMS IN THE NUTS.

351
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:54,667
HMM...THINK YOU'RE A
NUTPECKER, I SUPPOSE.

352
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:55,968
OH, I WAS JUST-

353
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,467
YOU WERE JUST UP TO
SOME OF YOUR OLD TRICKS!

354
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,534
COME ON-
UP WITH YOUR HANDS.

355
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:01,834
OH!

356
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,834
UP WITH YOUR HANDS!

357
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:05,968
SAW ANYTHING
LIKE YOU IN MY LIFE.

358
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,801
OH, HONEY,
DON'T DO THAT.

359
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:11,067
I AIN'T GOT NO BOTTLE.
YOU'RE ALWAYS FEELING MY-

360
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,868
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

361
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:14,501
WHERE'S YOUR COLLAR?

362
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,701
THIS AIN'T
NO FORMAL PARTY.

363
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:20,367
I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE REASON YOU
AIN'T WASHED YOUR HANDS NOR NOTHING.

364
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:22,567
PEOPLE WILL THINK
YOU GOT GLOVES ON!

365
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:24,200
GO ON-IN THE SINK.

366
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,701
DO I HAVE TO WASH?

367
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,701
IN THE SINK.

368
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:30,701
I HOPE TO GOODNESS YOU
DON'T STOP UP THE DRAINAGE.

369
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:31,868
GO ON!

370
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:34,934
AW, I DON'T WANT
TO WASH ANYMORE.

371
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,400
NO. YOU NEVER DO!

372
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:37,934
COME ON, NOW.
GET TO IT.

373
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,434
WON'T HURT YOU A BIT.

374
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,567
YOU KNOW, HONEY?

375
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:48,567
HMM?

376
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,834
SOAP'S A GREAT THING,
AIN'T IT?

377
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:53,334
YEAH, ESPECIALLY
FOR WHAT AILS YOU.

378
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,567
HA HA HA!

379
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:55,634
OH!

380
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:57,100
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

381
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,234
SAY, WILL YOU KEEP YOUR
DIRTY PAWS OUT OF THAT!

382
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,767
BUT I WANT TO-

383
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,467
CAN'T YOU WAIT FOR DINNER

384
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:03,834
YEAH, BUT LISTEN,
HONEY, I-

385
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:05,133

386
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,367
HURRY UP! QUICK!

387
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,534
YEAH, BUT LISTEN,
ANNIE, I GOT TO-

388
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:08,868
GET OUT OF HERE
AND GET YOURSELF DRESSED.

389
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:11,901
NOW, HURRY UP. YOUR NECK
LOOKS AS NAKED AS A TURKEY.

390
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:13,667
GO ON, NOW.

391
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,100

392
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,801
OH, MOM,
WHERE ARE YOU?

393
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,167
I'M HERE, KID.

394
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,667
HELLO, MOM.

00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,801
HELLO!

396
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,033
HELLO, BOY.

397
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,367
WELL, IS SHE HERE
WITH YOU?

398
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:28,834
YES-OUT ON THE DECK.

399
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:30,234
OH, THAT'S GRAND.

400
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,767
SAY, CHOW, WE'LL EAT JUST AS
SOON AS CAPTAIN TERRY'S READY.

401
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,133
ALL RIGHT,
MRS. BRENNAN.

402
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,701
MOM, I WANT TO SPEAK
TO YOU ALONE A MINUTE.

403
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:37,701
YEAH?

404
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,067
POP ALL RIGHT?

405
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,601
AW, HE'S AS DRY
AS A SALT MACKEREL.

406
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:42,901
I HOPE SO.

407
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,567
WELL, I SAW
TO THAT PERSONALLY.

408
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:47,200
THERE AIN'T NOTHING STRONGER
THAN ROOSTERSHEER SAUCE

409
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,934
THAT HE CAN GET AT!

410
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,734
OH, MISS PAT!

411
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:19,934
HOW NICE OF YOU
TO COME DOWN WITH ALEC.

412
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,501
YOU MUST BE AWFULLY PROUD
OF YOUR SON, MRS. BRENNAN-

413
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,334
A SHIP'S CAPTAIN
AT HIS AGE!

414
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,634
OH, I KNEW
HE'D MAKE IT.

415
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:27,200
THE MINUTE HE SET
HIS MIND ON IT,

416
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,400
IT WAS
AS GOOD AS DID.

417
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,033
HELLO, ALEC.
HELLO, POP.

418
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,200
HELLO, MISS PAT.

419
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:32,367
HELLO.

420
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:33,868
IT'S NICE WEATHER
WE'RE HAVING,

421
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,801
EVEN IF I DO SAY SO,
AS PERHAPS SHOULDN'T.

422
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:38,434
YES, IT'S DELIGHTFUL
DOWN HERE.

423
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:40,167
I ALWAYS
LOVE THE WATER.

424
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:42,968
YEAH. SOME PEOPLE DO.

425
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,334
WELL, THE COMBUSTIBLES
WILL BE GETTING ALL COLD.

426
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,534
ANNIE, I WAS
JUST THINKING.

427
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:52,000
MAYBE IT WOULDN'T BE NICE TO
ENTERTAIN COMPANY ON A DIRTY OLD TUG.

428
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:56,033
BY ANY CHANCE, ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE NARCISSUS, HUH?

429
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,701
OH, NO. SHE'S ALL RIGHT
AS FAR AS TUGS GO,

430
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:02,234
BUT I KNOW A SWELL
CHOP SUEY JOINT.

431
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,267
THEY'VE GOT
A MECHANICAL PIANO

432
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,868
AND THE SWELLEST
GUMBO SOUP.

433
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:10,434
OH, HO! GUMBO AIN'T A SOUP, YOU NINNY.

434
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:12,400
GUMBO'S A ELEPHANT.

435
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,200
WELL,
IT'S A SWELL PLACE.

436
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:15,901
THAT'S SWEET

437
00:30:15,968 --> 00:30:17,667
BUT I'M ALL SET
FOR THAT SAUERKRAUT.

438
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,067
THERE YOU ARE, NOW.

439
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,934
IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE COMPANY,

440
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I GUESS IT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO EAT ON, AIN'T IT?

441
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:24,334
COME ON. LET'S GO.

442
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,734
ANNIE, ANNIE,
WAIT A-

443
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:26,734
DON'T SHOVE.

444
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:28,100
I WANT TO WHISPER
SOMETHING.

445
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,434
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

446
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:31,934
DON'T YOU THINK
I BETTER GO ASHORE

447
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,234
AND GET SOME ICE CREAM TO
KIND OF LIVEN UP THE PARTY?

448
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,834
MM-HMM... THE WIND IS
OFF THE BREWERY AGAIN.

449
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:41,734
OH, I JUST HAD
A LITTLE BIT, LIKE THAT.

450
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:43,067
OH...

451
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,934
YOU COULDN'T EVEN SMELL IT
IF YOU WASN'T EXPECTING IT.

452
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,934
COME ON, MOM!

453
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,033
YEAH, ALEC.
I'M COMING.

454
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,033
COME ON!

455
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,801
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE
IN A MINUTE.

456
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:53,701
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

457
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,534
I GOT TO GO, ANNIE.

458
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:58,968
OH, WHY DO YOU LEAVE
EVERYTHING FOR THE LAST MINUTE?

459
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,400
HA HA!
I KNOW.

460
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,234
OH! OH, ALEX,

461
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,200
AND PAT WILL SIT
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

462
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:08,801
YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

463
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,200
THERE WE ARE.

464
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:13,334
AH!

465
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,767
THIS IS EVEN NICER
THAN I REMEMBERED.

466
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,367
NO WONDER YOU LOVE
THE NARCISSUS.

467
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,968
WELL, BARRING A SLIGHT WHEEZE
IN HER BOILER TUBES,

468
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,234
SHE'S AS GOOD AS THE DAY
I COME ABOARD.

469
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,234
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
THE WATERFRONT.

470
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,701
THERE'S SO MUCH
ATMOSPHERE.

471
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:30,000
OH, THAT'S THE
TIDE FLATS YOU SMELL.

472
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:34,801
THAT'S THE SAUERKRAUT
YOU SMELL, YOU MEAN.

473
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:36,667
WAIT TILL
YOU TASTE IT.

474
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:40,501
OH, THIS LOOKS
TOO GOOD TO EAT.

475
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:45,267
I READ IN THE PAPER ONLY YESTERDAY ABOUT
A MAN WHO ATE SPARERIBS AND SAUERKRAUT

476
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:48,467
AND HE NEVER KNEW
WHAT HIT HIM.

477
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,100
WHY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

478
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,501
POMAINE (PTOMAINE)
POISON.

479
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,834
IT'S A FACT.
IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY.

480
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:59,167
THEY DIE OFF
JUST LIKE FLIES.

481
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,067
WELL, MR. BRENNAN,

482
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:04,968
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE A
CHANCE WITH THE REST OF US?

483
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:10,067
FUNNY. I AIN'T HUNGRY,
SWEETHEART.

484
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:14,567
SAY, HAVE YOU BEEN SNEAKING
AROUND PINCHING GRUB AGAIN?

485
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:16,367
OH, NO.
HONEST, ANNIE.

486
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,033
I JUST AIN'T HUNGRY,
THAT'S ALL.

487
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,534
YOU AIN'T?
PAT, GO TO IT.

488
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,901
I'M JUST DYING TO SEE THE
EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE

489
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:24,567
WHEN YOU TAKE
THE FIRST SWALLOW.

490
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:25,701
MM-HMM.

491
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:28,367
HOPE I DONE
MYSELF JUSTICE.

492
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:31,334
WELL, HOW IS IT?

493
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,934
I, UH...

494
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,167
I NEVER TASTED ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT.

495
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:38,434
OH! TUCK IT
INTO YOU, KID.

496
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:40,434
TELL ME IF I DONE
MYSELF JUSTICE.

497
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,234
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
ALEX'S FAVORITE DISH.

498
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,100
FACT, I CAN HARDLY WAIT
TO GET AT IT MYSELF.

499
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:46,501
HA HA HA!

500
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:52,200
MOM, WHAT'S IN THIS?
IT'S AWFUL!

501
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:55,400
IT'S KIND OF SLIPPERY,
ISN'T IT?

502
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:58,067
GEE, I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

503
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:02,334
I NEVER LET MY FOOT SLIP
ON MY SAUERKRAUT BEFORE.

504
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,901
OH!

505
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:09,868
YOU GREAT BIG GALOOT!
THIS IS ALL YOUR DOING.

506
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:13,567
WELL, I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU IF
YOU'D KEPT YOUR BIG BAZOO CLOSED.

507
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:14,567
TOLD ME WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

508
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:16,033
DON'T YOU-
WHAT DID YOU DO?

509
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,567
POP!

510
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:19,133
DON'T YOU HIT, NOW.

511
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,400
HA! WELL, THE IDEA OF US BAWLING
EACH OTHER OUT IN FRONT OF MISS PAT.

512
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:26,234
YOU KNOW, IT'S A MISHAP THAT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO ANYBODY.

513
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
OF COURSE.

514
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,234
WHILE YOU WERE CARRYING
ON LIKE A SEA COW,

515
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,901
IT WOULD HAVE ALL
PASSED OFF AS PLEASANT-

516
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,901
YES! JUST AS
PLEASANT AS-

517
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:35,501
WELL, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

518
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:39,501
WE'LL SEND CHOW DOWN FOR A COUPLE
OF POUNDS OF PORK CHOPS, YOU KNOW?

519
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,767
THEY'RE MORE
DELICATE ANYHOW.

520
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:49,100
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ANYTHING I ATE, NO DOUBT.

521
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:52,601
WELL...I'LL TAKE PAT
TO A RESTAURANT.

522
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,767
LET'S ALL GO UPTOWN, BECAUSE
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER ANYWAY.

523
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:56,834
YEAH.

524
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:57,801
NO.

525
00:33:57,868 --> 00:33:59,701
YOU AND PAT RUN ALONG.

526
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:04,267
YOU KNOW, I KIND OF LOST
MY APPETITE...SOMEHOW.

527
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,601
COME ON, PAT.

528
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,434
ALL RIGHT.

529
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:11,167
GOOD-BYE,
MRS. BRENNAN.

530
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:12,167
GOOD-BYE, PAT.

531
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,234
GOOD-BYE, MOM.

532
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,534
GOOD-BYE, KID.

533
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:17,601
GOOD-BYE! COME BACK
AGAIN SOON. HEH HEH!

534
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:21,801
GOOD-BYE, ALEC!

535
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:25,934
GOOD-BYE!

536
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:08,000
I CALL IT EXTRAVAGANT,

537
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:10,501
TAKING A BUS JUST
TO GO A HALF A MILE.

538
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,734
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE DON'T
GO OUT IN SOCIETY EVERY DAY.

539
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:15,367
THAT'S
ALL RIGHT, TOO.

540
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:17,033
HOW ARE YOU?

541
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,400
OH! OH, ANNIE,
MY SHOES.

542
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:22,734
HA! I TOLD YOU TO WEAR
THE BOX THEY COME IN.

543
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:23,901
OH, YEAH.

544
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,734
WHERE TO?

545
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:27,667
PIER 62.

546
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,400
GLACIER QUEEN.

547
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,501
THANK YOU TOO MUCH.

548
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:47,267
STOP THE BUS!

549
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:52,033
WAIT A MINUTE.

550
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,934
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LADY?

551
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,567
MY HUSBAND'S CAR SICK.

552
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:58,667
WE'LL WALK THE REST
OF THE WAY.

553
00:36:58,734 --> 00:36:59,834
PHEW!

554
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,033
WAIT!
WAIT A MINUTE.

555
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,100
WAIT A MINUTE!
WAIT A MINUTE.

556
00:37:21,868 --> 00:37:23,367
GEE, MOM,
YOU LOOK SWELL.

557
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:24,834
DO I?

558
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:28,367
$25 MARKED DOWN
TO $9.98,

559
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:31,300
ON ACCOUNT OF IT
BEING A OFF-SIZE.

560
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:32,667
HA HA HA!

561
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:34,534
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SHAME YOU, ALEC.

562
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:35,901
OH, MOM.

563
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:39,334
I WOULDN'T BE ASHAMED OF YOU
IF YOU CAME IN A CANVAS BAG.

564
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,534
HA HA HA!

565
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:43,501
SAY, DON'T YOUR FATHER
LOOK GRAND?

566
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,067
HE SURE DOES.

567
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,901
HE'S THAT
GRATEFUL TO YOU

568
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:50,167
FOR NOT HOLDING THE
SAUERKRAUT AGAINST HIM.

569
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,801
YOU KNOW, HE AIN'T TOUCHED
A DROP TO DRINK SINCE.

570
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:56,234
LIABLE TO TAKE THE PLEDGE
AT ANY MINUTE NOW.

571
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,300
GOOD.

572
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:02,133
WILL YOU
HAVE SOME, MOM?

573
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,601
OH, THANK YOU.

574
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:04,667
YOU'RE WELCOME.

575
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,100
THANK YOU.

576
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,667
MMM.

577
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:13,234
THERE'S
SOMETHING IN IT.

578
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,934
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

579
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,033
WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?

580
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,033
WELL-AHEM-
I GRABBED MY KNIFE,

581
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,033
AND I JUMPED OVERBOARD,

582
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,667
AND I CAUGHT THAT SHARK
RIGHT IN THE GILLS.

583
00:38:28,734 --> 00:38:30,167
AND SAVED
THE MAN'S LIFE?

584
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:32,167
BARRING HIM GETTING
HIS HEAD CHEWED OFF,

585
00:38:32,234 --> 00:38:33,701
I GOT THERE JUST IN TIME.

586
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:35,200
JUST THINK OF YOU
BEING SUCH A HERO

587
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:37,033
AND TELLING US
NOTHING ABOUT IT!

588
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,100
OH, I DON'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT-HA!

589
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,601
AHH...

590
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,601
OH, TERRY!

591
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,934
OH, I'M THAT THIRSTY!

592
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:53,000
MMM!

593
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:56,167
TONGUE'S HANGING DOWN SO
LOW, ALMOST COULD STEP ON IT.

594
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,701
HEH HEH. THIS IS
MY LITTLE WIFE.

595
00:38:58,767 --> 00:38:59,701
YEAH.

596
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:01,334
I'LL BET YOU'RE PROUD
OF YOUR HUSBAND.

597
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,834
HE'S SUCH A BRAVE MAN.

598
00:39:02,901 --> 00:39:06,067
YEAH. BEEN TELLING YOU HOW HE
CAPTURED THEM PIRATES SINGLE-HANDED?

599
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,133
NO. HE WAS TELLING
US HOW HE RESCUED

600
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,667
THE MAN
FROM THE SHARK.

601
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:11,467
OH, THAT'S
A NEW ONE ON ME.

602
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:14,033
DO YOU MIND IF I BORROW
THE HERO A MINUTE?

603
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,200
NO.
OF COURSE NOT.

604
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:16,267
GOOD-BYE,
CAPTAIN BRENNAN.

605
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:18,534
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE.

606
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:26,300
NOW, TERRY, DON'T YOU
TOUCH A TASTE OF THIS.

607
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,200
WOULDN'T DO YOU
NO GOOD ANYHOW.

608
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:30,267
OH, ANNIE,
YOU DON'T TRUST ME-

609
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,701
A MAN OF HONOR
LIKE I AM?

610
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:34,067
WELL, HOW ARE YOU
ENJOYING THE PARTY?

611
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,033
OH, SAY,
YOU SURE DID

612
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,868
DO YOURSELF PROUD ON THIS THING, RED.

613
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:40,234
THANK YOU, TERRY.

614
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,567
ANNIE, YOU AND I SHOULD HAVE
A DANCE FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

615
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:46,734
OH, GO ON. YOU DON'T WANT TO
TOW AN OLD BARGE LIKE ME AROUND.

616
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,801
OH, SURE!
GO ON!

617
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,801
I AIN'T GOT A JEALOUS BONE IN MY HEAD.

618
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:53,200
GO ON.

619
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:57,767
WELL, I GUESS WE CAN'T NONE
OF US GET HURT VERY BAD.

620
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,868
COME ON, RED.

621
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:20,767
HEY, RED,

622
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,667
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO-

623
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:24,701
THE RUMPLE

624
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,300
I'LL BE BACK

625
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,434
THANK YOU,
TERRY, DEAR.

626
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,901
NONE FOR YOU,
TERRY?

627
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,934
OH, NO!
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

628
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,234
TERRY ISN'T DRINKING
ANYTHING ANYMORE.

629
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,534
ARE YOU,
TERRY, DEAR?

630
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:55,701
UH, NO.

631
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,567
SAY, TERRY, COME ON.
LET'S HAVE A DANCE.

632
00:40:57,634 --> 00:40:59,400
OH, ANNIE,
I CAN'T DANCE.

633
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:01,534
NOW, HEAR, YOU'VE JUST
BEEN HAVING TOO GOOD A TIME.

634
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,033
I WANT YOU
TO DANCE WITH ME.

635
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,968
OH, MY FEET HURT.

636
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:06,701
NOW, NEVER MIND
YOUR FEET.

637
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,567
YOU JUST...DANCE.

638
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,501
WE'RE GONNA-HA HA!

639
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,033
HOLD THAT FOR ME.

640
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,067
FUNNY-HA HA!
I'M DYING TO DANCE.

641
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,968
OH, ANNIE,
I CAN'T DANCE!

642
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,234
I KNOW, BUT I'M
JUST DYING TO DANCE.

643
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,901
WELL,
I DON'T DANCE.

644
00:41:22,968 --> 00:41:25,300
YOU NEVER WANT TO DO
ANYTHING I WANT TO DO.

645
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:28,601
KEEP OFF MY BUNION,
WILL YOU?

646
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:30,133
YOU KNOW, ANNIE,

647
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,234
YOU SEEM TO HAVE
MORE FEET THAN MOST PEOPLE.

648
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,167
HA HA HA!

649
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,934
SAY, IF I WASN'T SURE
YOU WAS DANCING,

650
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,968
I'D PASTE YOU FOR WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO ME.

651
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,334
OH, WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

652
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:51,534
OH, YOU DANCE AS IF
YOU HAD SNOWSHOES ON.

653
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:54,701
I WISH I DID HAVE.
MY FEET'S KILLING ME.

654
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:57,934
LET'S STOP. COME ON.
MY FEET HURT. THEY BURN.

655
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,667
MY FEET HURT,
I TELL YOU.

656
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:02,567
OH, MY GOODNESS, THE MINUTE
I GO TO HAVE A GOOD TIME,

657
00:42:02,634 --> 00:42:04,234
SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO YOU.

658
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,400
I WANT TO DANCE.

659
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:07,400
WELL, THEY BURN. THEY-

660
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:11,534
THANK YOU.

661
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:13,467
NO, YOU DON'T.

662
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,033
NO, YOU DON'T!

663
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
OH, PLEASE, ANNIE.
JUST ONE.

664
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,334
NO!

665
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,901
NOT ONE!

666
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:21,200
PARDON ME.

667
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:23,067
I HAVEN'T HAD THE
PLEASURE, MRS. BRENNAN,

668
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:25,067
BUT I'M YOUR SON'S SECOND OFFICER.

669
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:26,868
MAY I HAVE
THIS DANCE?

670
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:30,901
OH! YEAH, I'D...
BE DELIGHTED TO-

671
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:32,234
UH...

672
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,834
LET-LET'S TRY THAT
SWEDISH MOVEMENT AGAIN.

673
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,267
MY FAULT,
MRS. BRENNAN.

674
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,834
NO, NOT AT ALL.
NO, SON.

675
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:07,567
YOU DANCE LIKE
SAINT VITUS HIMSELF.

676
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:08,701
THANK YOU.

677
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:11,400
PHEW! IT'S GETTING
HOT IN HERE, ISN'T IT?

678
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:12,901
YES.

679
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:14,701
AHEM. THERE'S
A SEA COMING UP.

680
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:16,400
I DON'T THINK SO,
MRS. BRENNAN.

681
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:18,067
THERE'S A SEA
COMING UP.

682
00:43:19,267 --> 00:43:21,300
I DISTINCTLY
FELT IT.

683
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:23,667
YOU DON'T SEE MY
HUSBAND ANYPLACE, DO YOU?

684
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:24,901
NO, I DON'T,
MRS. BRENNAN.

685
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:27,067
I'VE GOT TO GO AND SEE WHAT HE'S DOING

686
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:29,000
AND TELL
HIM NOT TO.

687
00:43:32,968 --> 00:43:34,634
TERRY!

688
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:38,033
TERRY!

689
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,100
OH, I JUMPED ON AN ALLIGATOR,
THOUGHT IT WAS A HORSE

690
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:44,267
WITH A HOOPDAH DEE DAH

691
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:45,334
TERRY!

692
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,033
TERRY!

693
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,834
TERRY...

694
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,834
BREATHE.

695
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,167
I KNEW IT.

696
00:44:07,234 --> 00:44:08,934
YOU'RE DRUNK.

697
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:24,067
WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S
THE MATTER? IS IT A FIRE?

698
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:25,100
NO, MOM.

699
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:27,100
HELLO, ALEC.

700
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:28,934
OH, HELLO, POP.

701
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,200
HELLO, PAT.

702
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,934
HELLO, MR. BRENNAN.

703
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,667
WON'T YOU COME
ABOARD, MISS PAT?

704
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:35,100
NO. WE'VE ONLY
GOT A MOMENT.

705
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:37,901
GO ON, ALEC. TELL THEM
THE GLAD NEWS.

706
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:40,767
HAVE YOU BEEN MADE
FLEET COMMODORE, MAYBE?

707
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:43,067
HA HA! NO, BUT I'VE
GOTTEN DAD A JOB.

708
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:44,634
A JOB?

709
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:46,400
FOR ME?

710
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,100
YES. MR. SEVERN NEEDS
A WHARF MANAGER-

711
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:50,100
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO'LL
KEEP THINGS IN SHAPE

712
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:52,000
FOR THE ARRIVAL AND
DEPARTURE OF HIS SHIPS.

713
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:53,801
WOULD I BE A BOSS?

714
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:56,701
YOU'LL BE IN SOLE CHARGE
OF BOTH PIERS AND THEIR STAFFS.

715
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:58,200
OF COURSE,
IT MEANS HARD WORK,

716
00:44:58,267 --> 00:45:00,133
BUT IT'LL BE A GREAT
CHANCE FOR YOU, DAD.

717
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,067
WILL I HAVE TO
WEAR A COLLAR?

718
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:05,100
SAY, I'LL GET YOU A HORSE
COLLAR IF YOU AIN'T CAREFUL.

719
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,701
MOM, YOU CAN SELL THE
NARCISSUS AND LIVE ASHORE.

720
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:10,067
I'LL GET YOU
A NICE APARTMENT.

721
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,234
YOU MEAN LEAVE
THE NARCISSUS?

722
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,200
OH, MOM, YOU WORK
TOO HARD.

723
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:16,701
I WANT TO MAKE THINGS
EASIER FOR YOU.

724
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:17,868
OH, GO ON.

725
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:20,234
YOU TALK AS IF YOU
THOUGHT I WAS A OLD WOMAN.

726
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,734
IF YOU WON'T DO IT FOR YOUR
OWN SAKE, DO IT FOR MINE.

727
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:25,234
WHAT'LL PEOPLE SAY-
WITH A JOB LIKE MINE

728
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,200
AND MY MOTHER SLAVING HER
LIFE OUT ON AN OLD TOWBOAT?

729
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,567
WELL, OF COURSE, I-

730
00:45:29,634 --> 00:45:32,567
I WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO
MISJUDGE YOU ON ACCOUNT OF ME.

731
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:34,567
AND BESIDES, MOM, IT'LL
BE A GREAT CHANCE FOR DAD.

732
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:37,834
YOU CAN'T TELL. THE RESPONSIBILITY
MIGHT MAKE A NEW MAN OF HIM.

733
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,067
YEAH?

734
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:43,067
WELL, IT'S ALL
KIND OF SUDDEN.

735
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:45,901
OF COURSE, IF YOU THINK
IT WAS GOOD FOR YOUR DAD-

736
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:47,067
IT WILL BE.

737
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:48,033
UH-HUH.

738
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,334
IT'S ALL SET, PAT!

739
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,267
GOOD!

740
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,334
DAD, YOU GET DRESSED

741
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,667
AND GO UP AND SEE
SEVERN RIGHT AWAY.

742
00:45:52,734 --> 00:45:54,000
HE'S EXPECTING YOU.
NOW, HURRY UP!

743
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,033
I'VE GOT TO GO
BACK UPTOWN.

744
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,167
AND, MOM, SEE THAT HE'S
CLEANED UP, WON'T YOU?

745
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:01,167
OH, I'LL SCRUB HIM WITH
SANDPAPER AND STEEL WOOL

746
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:03,167
TILL HE SHINES
LIKE A CRANKSHAFT.

747
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:04,501
FINE.

748
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:05,467
BYE, MOM.

749
00:46:05,534 --> 00:46:06,400
GOOD-BYE!

750
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:08,200
BYE, POP.
BYE-BYE, ALEC.

751
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:10,200
YOU TELL SEVERN I'LL
BE UP THERE, ALL RIGHT.

752
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,300
ALL RIGHT.

753
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,033
GOOD-BYE.
BYE!

754
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,367
GOOD-BYE,
PAT!

755
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:15,934
GOOD-BYE!

756
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:21,000
SAY, YOU GO AND SWAB
YOUR CARCASS.

757
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:24,067
DON'T WASH YOUR FACE
WITH YOUR HAT ON!

758
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:36,467
OH, WELL.

759
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:41,300
23 YEARS IS TOO LONG TO
LIVE IN ANY ONE PLACE ANYHOW.

760
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:48,801
BE GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM
YOU, YOU DIRTY OLD...TUB.

761
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:55,067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
ANNIE-TALKING TO YOURSELF?

762
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,567
AW, LISTEN, HONEY.

763
00:46:59,634 --> 00:47:01,701
ALEC IS RIGHT.

764
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:05,167
HIM BEING THE CAPTAIN OF A BIG LINER

765
00:47:05,234 --> 00:47:07,501
AND ME THE MASTER
OF THE DOCKS-

766
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:10,834
WHY, WE GOT TO KIND
OF LIVE IN STYLE,

767
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:13,267
WHERE IT'S ALWAYS
HIGH TIDE.

768
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:16,100
YEAH, AND HIGH RENT.

769
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:21,334
AW, YOU-YOU AIN'T GONNA
BE MISSING THE NARCISSUS?

770
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,834
ME? MISSING
THIS PIECE OF SEAWEED?

771
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:27,133
COURSE I AIN'T.

772
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:31,667
ONE THING OUGHT
TO CHEER YOU UP.

773
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:33,067
WHAT?

774
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:37,200
WELL, YOU-YOU'LL
ALWAYS HAVE ME.

775
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:39,901
HUH! YEAH.

776
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,868
OH, YOU OLD FOOL, YOU.

777
00:47:57,434 --> 00:47:59,000
AHOY THERE, PARTNER.

778
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:00,167
OH, HELLO,
TERRY.

779
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:02,734
I WAS
WONDERING WHEN-

780
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:04,934
WHY, YOU'VE BEEN
DRINKING.

781
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,501
OH, YOU GOT ME
ALL WRONG.

782
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:10,267
I JUST BEEN WETTING
ME NEW COMMISSION.

783
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,834
MR. SEVERN WANTED
TO SEE ME, MISS BLAKE.

784
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:19,701
WELL...YOUR FATHER'S IN WITH
HIM NOW, CAPTAIN BRENNAN.

785
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:21,667
MY FATHER?
OH, THAT'S FINE!

786
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:23,667
I GUESS I CAN
GO RIGHT IN, THEN.

787
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,601
IF YOUR OWN KINFOLKS
CAN'T SHARE WITH YOU

788
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:28,334
IN THE STEAMSHIP
BUSINESS,

789
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,133
I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN,
YOU OLD SEA MULE.

790
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,834
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
MAKING THIS A FAMILY AFFAIR.

791
00:48:33,901 --> 00:48:36,033
MY SON ALEX IS GOING
TO MARRY YOUR-

792
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,167
HEY, POP!

793
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:39,868
HELLO, ALEX. I WAS
JUST DISCUSSING WITH-

794
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:41,567
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS,
MR. SEVERN.

795
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:43,734
WHEN YOUR FATHER LEAVES,
I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU.

796
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,601
WHY, CERTAINLY, SIR.

797
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:48,334
I'LL SEE YOU
ON THE TUG IN AN HOUR.

798
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:52,133
ALL RIGHT, ALEC.

799
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,901
SO LONG, RED!

800
00:48:53,968 --> 00:48:57,000
YOU NEED ME,
YOU SEND FOR ME,

801
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,968
AND I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

802
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:08,000
HEY, CHOW-HERE.

803
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:10,167
HERE. YOU CAN
HAVE THIS, TOO.

804
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:12,000
YEAH, AND ALL THESE.

805
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:15,934
NOW THAT CAPTAIN BRENNAN'S
GONNA GET A SWELL JOB ASHORE,

806
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,167
HE'S GONNA GET ME
A GRAND FLAT TO LIVE IN.

807
00:49:19,234 --> 00:49:21,167
WILL HE KEEP SOBER?

808
00:49:21,234 --> 00:49:23,200
WHY, HE HASN'T HAD
ANYTHING TO DRINK-

809
00:49:23,267 --> 00:49:26,501
SAY, WHO ARE YOU TO
TALK LIKE THAT? THE IDEA!

810
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:29,100
HE AIN'T HAD A DROP
TO DRINK IN-

811
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,901
IMAGINE HIM
TRYING TO TELL ME

812
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,033
WHERE TO GET OFF AT!

813
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,434
ME! HA! HIM TO-

814
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:41,701
TELLING ME WHERE
TO GET OFF AT.

815
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:43,033
HIM!

816
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:48,267
ME-WHY, I WOULDN'T SPIT
ON HIM IF HE WAS ON FIRE.

817
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:54,067
SO...YOU LOST THE JOB.

818
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:58,734
AW, ANNIE, IT WAS WAY
BENEATH MY DIGNITY.

819
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:00,033
HMM.

820
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,701
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE SEE'D
THE WAY HE TREATED ME-

821
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,200
ME! JUST LIKE
I WAS DIRT.

822
00:50:06,267 --> 00:50:09,267
HMM. YOU HAD
WORDS WITH HIM?

823
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:12,400
WELL, HE THOUGHT
HE KNOWED IT ALL,

824
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,234
AND I SHOWED HIM
HE DIDN'T.

825
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,400
I SAYS,
"RED SEVERN-

826
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:19,901
YEAH. HIM BEING
YOUR BOY'S BOSS

827
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:21,667
WASN'T ENOUGH TO MUZZLE
YOUR UGLY LIP, WAS IT?

828
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:25,868
WELL, I WASN'T GONNA LET
HIM MAKE A MONKEY OUT OF ME!

829
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:28,767
NO! YOU'RE THAT ALREADY!

830
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:33,234
STOP, ANNIE!
ANNIE!

831
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:40,601
OH!

832
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,501
MOM!

833
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:45,501
WHY, MOM,
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

834
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:47,601
MOM! ARE YOU HURT?

835
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:48,934
WHAT HAPPENED, MOM?

836
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,868
I- I-I WAS JUST REASONING
WITH YOUR FATHER.

837
00:50:51,934 --> 00:50:53,400
YOU STRUCK HER!

838
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,000
OH, NO!

839
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:58,067
YOUR FATHER NEVER
STRUCK ME IN HIS LIFE-

840
00:50:58,133 --> 00:50:59,901
EXCEPTING IN SELF-DEFENSE.

841
00:50:59,968 --> 00:51:02,501
YOU GO AND PUT YOUR HEAD
UNDER THE PUMP.

842
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:16,400
MOM, LISTEN, I'VE BEEN
PATIENT FOR A LONG TIME,

843
00:51:16,467 --> 00:51:19,234
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU PUT
UP FOR ANOTHER MINUTE WITH THAT-

844
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,734
NOW, ALEC... IT'S YOUR
FATHER YOU'RE SPEAKING OF.

845
00:51:22,801 --> 00:51:24,400
OH, I'M NOT
FORGETTING THAT, MOM.

846
00:51:24,467 --> 00:51:27,701
BUT FATHER OR NO FATHER, I'VE
DONE EVERYTHING I CAN FOR HIM,

847
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:29,334
AND FOR YEARS NOW,

848
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,901
YOU'VE SLAVED AND WORRIED
AND MADE EXCUSES FOR HIM-

849
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:35,601
I KNOW, I KNOW. YOU'RE UPSET
BECAUSE HE LOST HIS JOB.

850
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:38,167
I DON'T BLAME YOU
A BIT, BUT-

851
00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:39,767
NO "BUTS"
THIS TIME, MOM.

852
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:43,067
LISTEN, YOU'RE GOING
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

853
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,067
YOU MEAN...LEAVE HIM?

854
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:46,434
YES!

855
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:50,901
WHY, SON,
I'M MARRIED TO HIM.

856
00:51:50,968 --> 00:51:53,334
OH, MOM, I'LL TAKE
THE BEST OF CARE OF YOU.

857
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,367
I'LL DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

858
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:59,501
OH, I KNOW, BUT WHAT
WOULD HE DO WITHOUT ME?

859
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:02,033
WELL, COULD HE DO ANY
WORSE THAN HE DOES WITH YOU?

860
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,033
MOM, IT MIGHT BE THE BEST
THING IN THE WORLD FOR HIM.

861
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,033
IT MIGHT BE THE ONE THING
THAT WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT-

862
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,901
YOU KNOW,
A JOLT LIKE THAT.

863
00:52:09,968 --> 00:52:13,567
YEAH. I'VE TRIED
EVERYTHING ELSE, HAVEN'T I?

864
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:17,234
HONEST, I DON'T SEE
HOW I COULD DO IT.

865
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,067
OH, MOM,
YOU'VE GOT TO.

866
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:20,434
ANNIE?

867
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:21,734
ANNIE?

868
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:25,968
I WAS JUST-JUST THINKING
THAT MAYBE IF YOU'D GO OVER

869
00:52:26,033 --> 00:52:28,834
AND KIND OF APOLOGIZE
TO RED SEVERN FOR MY-

870
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:31,000
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU!

871
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:33,300
MOM'S LEAVING HERE
TONIGHT FOR GOOD.

872
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:37,601
SHE SHOULD HAVE
LEFT YOU YEARS AGO.

873
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:40,100
NOW THAT I CAN, I'M
GOING TO GIVE HER THE REST

874
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:43,300
AND COMFORT THAT SHE'S
NEVER HAD WITH YOU.

875
00:52:45,934 --> 00:52:48,400
AW...

876
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:55,100
I - I KNOW I AIN'T BEEN SO GOOD AS A HUSBAND
AND A FATHER, BUT...

877
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:59,267
AND I DON'T
BLAME ANNIE,

878
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:03,300
BUT SHE WOULDN'T BE HAPPY ANYPLACE
ELSE BUT HERE ON THE NARCISSUS.

879
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:05,400
YOU KNOW THAT.

880
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:09,801
SO...I'LL GO.

881
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:13,434
TERRY!
WHERE WOULD YOU GO?

882
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:15,300
OH...

883
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:18,334
IT DON'T MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE-

884
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
AN OLD SOAK LIKE ME.

885
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:22,067
YOU'RE NOT AN OLD SOAK!

886
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:25,968
WHEN YOU'RE SOBER, THERE AIN'T A
FINER MAN ON THE WHOLE WATERFRONT.

887
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:28,734
MOM, DON'T YOU SEE? HE'S
JUST TRYING TO GET AROUND YOU.

888
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:31,400
THAT'S RIGHT.
GO ON AND ABUSE ME.

889
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:34,067
I WON'T HOLD IT
AGIN YOU.

890
00:53:34,133 --> 00:53:36,100
I'LL GO.

891
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:39,834
I AIN'T GOT NO PLACE
TO GO TO, BUT I'LL GO.

892
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:41,667
AW, YOU CAN'T GO!

893
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:42,767
NOW, MOM-

894
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,767
ALEC, IT'S USELESS.
IT'S USELESS, I SAY!

895
00:53:44,834 --> 00:53:48,601
TERRY, YOU'RE A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING
SEAGOING COCKROACH,

896
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,567
BUT YOUR PLACE
IS HERE WITH ME.

897
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:52,100
HE NEEDS ME, ALEC.

898
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:53,868
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT UP
WITH THIS FOR ANOTHER MINUTE.

899
00:53:53,934 --> 00:53:55,801
HE'LL END UP IN THE GUTTER
AND DRAG YOU THERE WITH HIM.

900
00:53:55,868 --> 00:53:58,200
NOW, MOM, LISTEN. HE'S MAKING
A FOOL OF YOU RIGHT NOW,

901
00:53:58,267 --> 00:54:00,868
THE WAY HE HAS ALL YOUR
LIFE-PLAYED ON YOUR SYMPATHIES.

902
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:01,834
MOM,
MY MIND'S MADE UP.

903
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:03,367
DON'T SAY THAT, SON.

904
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:05,234
YOU CAN STAY HERE WITH
HIM OR COME WITH ME,

905
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,400
BUT YOU CAN'T
HAVE US BOTH.

906
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:09,534
OH! YOU DON'T MEAN THAT!

907
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:11,667
I NEVER MEANT ANYTHING
SO MUCH IN MY LIFE.

908
00:54:11,734 --> 00:54:12,868
OHH!

909
00:54:12,934 --> 00:54:17,133
ME OWN SON
AND ME OWN WIFE.

910
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,567
TURNED AGAINST ME, HUH?

911
00:54:20,634 --> 00:54:22,567
ALL RIGHT.

912
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,567
HE CAN DO LOTS MORE
FOR YOU THAN I-

913
00:54:25,634 --> 00:54:27,467
KEEP OUT OF THIS,
YOU RUM-

914
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,901
ALEC!

915
00:54:38,968 --> 00:54:40,567
ALEC!

916
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:44,667
ALEC!

917
00:54:46,634 --> 00:54:48,067
ALEC!

918
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:51,133
ALEC!

919
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,000
AW, LISTEN, ANNIE.

920
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:00,801
I'M GONNA BE
A CHANGED MAN.

921
00:55:00,868 --> 00:55:03,400
YOU'LL BE PROUD
OF ME.

922
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:10,200
WHY, I AIN'T GONNA DRINK
ANOTHER DROP AS LONG AS I LIVE.

923
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:16,367
HONEST, I AIN'T.

924
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:18,434
ALEC...

925
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,868
CAN YOU SEE HIM, HONEY?

926
00:55:30,934 --> 00:55:32,501
YEAH.

927
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:34,868
UH, GIVE ME A LOOK.

928
00:55:34,934 --> 00:55:38,767
APPEARS TO ME HE'S GOT
THINNER IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS.

929
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:41,300
I BET HE AIN'T
EATING RIGHT.

930
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,567
HE DOES LOOK KIND
OF PEAKED, DON'T HE?

931
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:48,334
YEAH. I BET HE AIN'T
WEARING HIS THICK UNDERWEAR,

932
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,200
NOW THAT HE AIN'T
GOT ME TO NAG HIM.

933
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:54,200
SAY, HE'LL CATCH HIS DEATH
OF COLD IN THAT NORTHERN RUN,

934
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,033
SURE AS SHOOTING.

935
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,834
YOU KNOW, UH,
I- I KIND OF-

936
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:00,334
KIND OF THOUGHT
HE'D COME TO SEE US

937
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,434
WHEN HE WAS
IN THE HARBOR THIS TIME.

938
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:07,701
YEAH. WELL... NICE TO SEE
HIM COMING AND...GOING.

939
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:09,100
YEAH.

940
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:11,334
ANNIE!

941
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,167
HELLO, SAM!

942
00:56:13,234 --> 00:56:15,100
GOT THEM
REPAIRS MADE?

943
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,734
BEST I CAN.

944
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:20,968
THERE AIN'T NO WAY TO REALLY REPAIR
THEM BOILERS EXCEPT TO GET NEW ONES.

945
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:22,734
WELL, TRY WHISTLING.

946
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:25,200
PERHAPS SOME NEW ONES
WILL COME DANCING ON BOARD.

947
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:27,334
AW, YOU NEEDN'T
GET SORE, ANNIE.

948
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,067
IT AIN'T MY FAULT THAT ANY TUGBOAT
IN THIS HARBOR CAN SHOW US ITS STERN

949
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:35,601
OR THAT WE'RE LOSING BUSINESS
RIGHT AND LEFT AND HINDWAYS!

950
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:54,667
WE GOT BAD BUSINESS

951
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:56,467
AND WE GOT
BAD BOILERS

952
00:56:56,534 --> 00:56:58,501
BECAUSE WE GOT
BAD BUSINESS.

953
00:56:58,567 --> 00:57:00,667
JUST LIKE A
MERRY-GO-ROUND, AIN'T IT?

954
00:57:00,734 --> 00:57:02,834
YEAH. YEAH.

955
00:57:02,901 --> 00:57:04,534
YOU KNOW, ANNIE?

956
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:05,701
WHAT?

957
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:08,434
IF I ONLY HAD
SOME MONEY SOMEWHERE,

958
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:13,534
I'D GO RIGHT OUT AND BUY
NEW BOILERS JUST LIKE THAT.

959
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:15,634
SURE YOU WOULD.

960
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:17,701
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME

961
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,033
LIVING ON THIS WATERFRONT
ALL THE YEARS WE HAVE,

962
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,767
THERE OUGHT TO BE
SOMEBODY ASHORE

963
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:27,667
LET US HAVE SOME MONEY FOR NEW BOILERS.

964
00:57:27,734 --> 00:57:30,000
THEY SURE SHOULD.

965
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:33,334
YOU KNOW...

966
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,567
WHAT?

967
00:57:34,634 --> 00:57:36,567
I'M GOING ASHORE,
AND I'M-

968
00:57:36,634 --> 00:57:39,067
AH, NO.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

969
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:41,400
HA HA! YOU'RE GONNA
STAY HERE.

970
00:57:41,467 --> 00:57:42,734
I'LL GO ASHORE.

971
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:44,234
ALL RIGHT, ANNIE.

972
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,033
AND IF THERE'S A
TUGBOAT TOW COMES ALONG,

973
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,067
IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT
TILL I GET BACK.

974
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:52,234
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.
YOU GO ASHORE.

975
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:55,167
HEH HEH!

976
00:57:55,234 --> 00:57:57,133
GO ON AWAY,
YOU BIG SLOB.

977
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:03,467
BUT, ANNIE, IT'D COST 2,000
OR 3,000 TO OVERHAUL HER.

978
00:58:03,534 --> 00:58:07,033
AFTER ALL, THE NARCISSUS IS40 YEARS OLD.

979
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,901
THAT'S NOTHING.
I'M MORE THAN THAT MYSELF.

980
00:58:09,968 --> 00:58:13,434
ANNIE, TERRY IS
A BAD RISK,

981
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:16,100
AND YOU-WELL, YOU'RE
NOT AS YOUNG AS YOU WERE.

982
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:20,868
I'M AS GOOD A TUGBOAT
MAN AS EVER I WERE!

983
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:22,701
YOUR BOY IS RIGHT.

984
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:25,067
YOU OUGHT TO RETIRE,
TAKE IT EASY.

985
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,434
I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
JOHN WILCOX,

986
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:30,367
THE NARCISSUS NOR ME AIN'T
READY FOR THE BONEYARD YET!

987
00:58:30,434 --> 00:58:32,534
HUH! RETIRE, INDEED!

988
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:34,934
SAY, I AIN'T ASKING
YOU NO FAVORS-

989
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,200
JUST A PLAIN BUSINESS DEAL
WITH THE USUAL INTEREST.

990
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:43,234
HUH! SAY, IF YOU AIN'T WILLING TO
ACCOMMODATE ME, THERE'S OTHERS THAT IS.

991
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,968
I NEVER ASKED A FAVOR
FROM NOBODY IN MY LIFE.

992
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:48,734
I'M SORRY, MRS...

993
00:58:48,801 --> 00:58:50,734
BRENNAN. TUGBOAT
ANNIE BRENNAN.

994
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:51,667
MRS. BRENNAN-

995
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:52,667
HMM.

996
00:58:52,734 --> 00:58:55,000
TUGBOATS ARE ENTIRELY
OUT OF OUR LINE.

997
00:58:55,067 --> 00:58:56,167
HMM.

998
00:58:56,234 --> 00:58:58,067
HAVE YOU
ANY OTHER SECURITY?

999
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:02,834
NO. THE NARCISSUS IS THE
ONLY THING I GOT IN THE WORLD-

1000
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:04,634
IN THE WAY
OF SECURITY.

1001
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:06,400
WE CAN'T AFFORD
THE RISK.

1002
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:08,167
SORRY.

1003
00:59:08,234 --> 00:59:10,367
WELL, I'M SORRY, TOO.

1004
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,934
HELLO, ANNIE.
HOW ARE YOU?

1005
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,200
OH, KIND OF
LA-DI-DA, MEYER.

1006
00:59:25,267 --> 00:59:27,033
HOW ARE THINGS
WITH YOU?

1007
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,868
I CERTAINLY
CAN'T COMPLAIN!

1008
00:59:28,934 --> 00:59:31,901
HMM! THAT'S GOOD.

1009
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,634
SAY, MIND IF...
I COME IN AWHILE?

1010
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:36,367
NO. WISH
YOU WOULD.

1011
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:38,701
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU.

1012
00:59:38,767 --> 00:59:40,634
WELL, YOU TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT.

1013
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:42,367
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT ANYTHING?

1014
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:44,367
ME, WORRIED? NO!

1015
00:59:44,434 --> 00:59:46,434
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

1016
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,067
CAPTAIN BRENNAN.

1017
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:56,067
HUH?

1018
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:58,234
AW, SURE.

1019
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,834
WHERE?

1020
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:03,534
RIGHT AWAY, RIGHT AWAY.
SURE.

1021
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,567
COME ON, SHIF'LESS.

1022
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:10,567
WE GOT TO PICK UP A LUMBER
BARGE DOWN AT THE POOL.

1023
01:00:10,634 --> 01:00:12,033
TELL SAM
TO CAST OFF.

1024
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,567
BUT ANNIE AIN'T HERE!

1025
01:00:13,634 --> 01:00:16,234
WHAT OF IT? DON'T I DRAW AS MUCH
WATER ON THIS TUG AS ANNIE DOES?

1026
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,968
LET'S GO. COME ON.
SHOVE OFF.

1027
01:00:23,467 --> 01:00:24,868
HMM! GEE...

1028
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:26,534
THANK YOU, MEYER.

1029
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:28,167
THAT'S MIGHTY FINE OF YOU.

1030
01:00:28,234 --> 01:00:29,767
DON'T THANK ME,
ANNIE.

1031
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:33,200
LENDING MONEY TO THE BEST
TUGBOAT SKIPPER ON THE COAST

1032
01:00:33,267 --> 01:00:35,434
IS A GOOD
BUSINESS INVESTMENT.

1033
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:37,767
OH, I KNOW, BUT-
GOOD LUCK.

1034
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,934
JUST THE SAME, I...

1035
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,968
I THANK YOU.

1036
01:00:42,968 --> 01:00:44,834
AND BLESS YOU.

1037
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:50,934
YOU OLD RAT-WHISKERED
SON OF A GUN, YOU!

1038
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,534
HA HA HA!
DROP IN ANYTIME, ANNIE.

1039
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:01,801
OH, I JUMPED ON AN ALLIGATOR

1040
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:05,000
THOUGHT IT WAS A HORSE
WITH A HOO-DA, HOO-DA-LA-DA

1041
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,100
HEY, SHIF'LESS!

1042
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:17,400
YEAH?

1043
01:01:17,467 --> 01:01:20,868
LOOK AT THAT BOX
OFF THE BOW, WILL YOU?

1044
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:23,534
WHAT IS IT?

1045
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:28,100
LOOKS LIKE A BOX OF HOOCH
SOME RUMRUNNER DROPPED.

1046
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,901
GET THE POLE, AND I'LL
SWING HER ABOUT.

1047
01:01:30,968 --> 01:01:32,300
SURE!

1048
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,767
TERRY, PULL HER
AROUND MORE, WILL YOU?

1049
01:01:58,033 --> 01:02:01,133
IT'S TERRY BRENNAN! WHAT'S
THE DRUNKEN FOOL TRYING TO DO?

1050
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,667
HARD ASTERN!

1051
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:07,667
HEY!
LOOK OUT THERE!

1052
01:02:07,734 --> 01:02:09,400
WHAT...

1053
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,434
HEY!

1054
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:21,634
LOOKS LIKE THE NARCISSUS
RAMMEDTHE FERRYBOAT!

1055
01:02:42,701 --> 01:02:44,434
IT'S TOO BAD,
ANNIE.

1056
01:03:07,434 --> 01:03:09,400
GENTLEMEN,
I ASSURE YOU,

1057
01:03:09,467 --> 01:03:12,701
YOU WOULD NEVER GET A CHANCE LIKE THIS
IF IT WEREN'T THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL TUGBOAT,

1058
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:15,234
WITH YEARS OF HONEST WORK
AHEAD OF HER,

1059
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:20,200
HAD TO BE SOLD TO SATISFY THE JUDGMENT
OF THE FERRY COMPANY AGAINST HER.

1060
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:23,400
COME ON, NOW.
WHO'LL GIVE ME A REAL OFFER?

1061

1064
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:31,601
WHO'LL GIVE ME 3,000?

1065
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:32,667
3,000.

1066
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:33,868

1067
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:36,467
NOW...NOW, WHO'LL

1068
01:03:36,534 --> 01:03:40,567
WHO'LL GIVE ME 3,200 FOR...

DO I HEAR THE 35?

1076
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,801
NO? GOING AT 3,200.

1077
01:03:59,868 --> 01:04:01,167
GOING ONCE...

1078
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:02,934

1083
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,734
GOSH, ANNIE, DO YOU KNOW
WHO BOUGHT THE NARCISSUS?

1084
01:04:24,801 --> 01:04:28,200
REYNOLDS, WHAT'S GOT THE
GARBAGE CONCESSION FOR THE CITY.

1085
01:04:28,267 --> 01:04:32,934
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE HE'D BE USING
THE NARCISSUS TO TOW THE SCOWS WITH?

1086
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,234
TOWING GARBAGE.

1087
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,734
HELLO, ANNIE.

1088
01:04:41,801 --> 01:04:43,801
I JUST BOUGHT
YOUR NARCISSUS.

1089
01:04:43,868 --> 01:04:45,601
YES, I KNOW.

1090
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:47,767
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO NOW, ANNIE?

1091
01:04:47,834 --> 01:04:50,133
GET A JOB.

1092
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,033
THERE AIN'T MANY JOBS ALONG THE WATERFRONT,
AND YOU AIN'T AS YOUNG AS YOU WAS.

1093
01:04:57,133 --> 01:05:00,868
WELL...I'LL GET SOMETHING.

1094
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:03,000
BESIDES...

1095
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:06,067
I GOT TERRY TO HELP ME.

1096
01:05:08,234 --> 01:05:12,634
SAY, HOW'D YOU LIKE TO STAY
ON AS SKIPPER OF THE NARCISSUS?

1097
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,868
THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

1098
01:05:14,934 --> 01:05:18,067
YEAH. WHEN YOU GOT AN OLD,
BROKEN-DOWN TUG LIKE THAT,

1099
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:21,067
IT'S GOOD BUSINESS TO HAVE SOMEBODY
AT THE WHEEL THAT KNOWS HER TRICKS.

1100
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:24,501
COURSE, IT AIN'T MUCH MONEY,
BUT STILL, IT'S A JOB.

1101
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:26,634
YEAH...

1102
01:05:26,701 --> 01:05:28,868
IT'S A JOB.

1103
01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:34,300
KIND OF SILLY TO GET A NEW
SKIPPER FOR THE NARCISSUS

1104
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:36,901
AFTER SHE AND ME HAS...

1105
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,734
BEEN RIDING THE WAVES
SO LONG TOGETHER.

1106
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:42,067
GOOD.
THEN IT'S A DEAL.

1107
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:43,701
MM-HMM.

1108
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:45,801
IT'S A DEAL.

1109
01:05:45,868 --> 01:05:48,300
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU
UP AT THE OFFICE.

1110
01:05:52,534 --> 01:05:55,501
WELL, TERRY, COME ON.

1111
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:57,868
WE GOT A GOOD JOB...

1112
01:05:57,934 --> 01:06:00,167
YOU AND ME.

1113
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,067
NARCISSUS! AHOY!

1114
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:47,267
PATTY!

1115
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:49,200
CAN I COME ABOARD?

1116
01:06:49,267 --> 01:06:51,400
WHY, SURE!
COME ON.

1117
01:06:51,467 --> 01:06:52,934
MY GOODNESS,

1118
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,334
BUT THIS IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

1119
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,067
WELL, PATTY!

1120
01:06:58,133 --> 01:06:59,300
OH!

1121
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:00,968
NOW, DON'T YOU GET UP.

1122
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:02,000
OH, DEAR.

1123
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:03,501
COME ON.
SIT DOWN HERE.

1124
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:05,534
NO, NO, NO. YOU SIT
THERE. I'LL SIT HERE.

1125
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:07,033
OH, MY, BUT IT'S
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1126
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,701
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T MIND
MY COMING ABOARD.

1127
01:07:08,767 --> 01:07:14,567
MIND? WHY, YOU'RE AS WELCOME AS A
GRASSHOPPER IN A CRATE OF TURKEYS.

1128
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,734
THANK YOU.
HOW'S YOUR HUSBAND?

1129
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:22,400
OH, TERRY?
OH, WHY, HE-

1130
01:07:22,467 --> 01:07:25,200
HE'S IN BED WITH A BAD
CASE OF BROWN CRITTERS.

1131
01:07:25,267 --> 01:07:28,267
AW. THAT'S A SHAME.
AND HOW ARE YOU?

1132
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:30,934
ME? OH, I'M ALL...

1133
01:07:32,934 --> 01:07:35,367
WELL, TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH...

1134
01:07:35,434 --> 01:07:37,734
THE GARBAGE HAS GOT ME.

1135
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:41,834
YOU KNOW, HALF THE TIME, I CAN'T
KEEP ANYTHING ON MY STOMACH-

1136
01:07:41,901 --> 01:07:43,901
EXCEPT MY HANDS.
HA HA HA!

1137
01:07:43,968 --> 01:07:45,734
OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

1138
01:07:45,801 --> 01:07:48,801
YOU KNOW, I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO GET USED TO IT DOWN HERE.

1139
01:07:48,868 --> 01:07:50,400
NO, NO.

1140
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:53,300
A SMELL'S A SMELL,
AND...HA HA!

1141
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:56,701
AFTER 6 WEEKS,
A ONION IS A ONION.

1142
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:01,467
MY! THAT'S A PRETTY DRESS YOU GOT ON.

1143
01:08:01,534 --> 01:08:03,100
LIKE IT?

1144
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:08,067
YES. I'LL HAVE TO BE
GOING SHOPPING MYSELF

1145
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:09,901
PRETTY SOON, I GUESS.

1146
01:08:09,968 --> 01:08:11,767
MY CLOTHES ARE...

1147
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:13,901
KIND OF BAD.

1148
01:08:16,067 --> 01:08:18,367
HOW IS HE?

1149
01:08:19,934 --> 01:08:23,467
HE MISSES YOU DREADFULLY,
BUT YOU KNOW HOW STUBBORN HE IS.

1150
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:26,200
OH, NO,
HE'S NOT STUBBORN.

1151
01:08:26,267 --> 01:08:27,767
HE'S JUST
STRONG-MINDED.

1152
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:29,167
NOT STUBBORN.

1153
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:32,200
WHATEVER IT IS, THE MINUTE
HE GETS BACK FROM THIS TRIP,

1154
01:08:32,267 --> 01:08:34,167
I'M GOING TO MAKE HIM
COME RIGHT DOWN HERE.

1155
01:08:34,234 --> 01:08:36,467
NO, NO. NO, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO DO THAT.

1156
01:08:36,534 --> 01:08:40,033
IF HE COMES DOWN HERE, I WANT
HIM TO COME OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD.

1157
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,000
IT'S NICE
OF YOU, THOUGH,

1158
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:45,567
TO WANT TO PATCH
THINGS UP FOR US.

1159
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:52,067
YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN
HE WAS A LITTLE SHAVER,

1160
01:08:52,133 --> 01:08:55,567
I USED TO WONDER WHAT KIND
OF A GIRL HE'D PICK ON.

1161
01:08:55,634 --> 01:08:57,300
I BET HE WAS
A CUTE ONE.

1162
01:08:57,367 --> 01:09:00,868
HE WAS THE COMELIEST LITTLE
THING THAT EVER WET HIS MAINSAILS.

1163
01:09:00,934 --> 01:09:03,300
I GOT HIS PICTURE
RIGHT HERE.

1164
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:04,901
OH. CAN I SEE IT?

1165
01:09:04,968 --> 01:09:06,367
YEAH, SURE.

1166
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:07,968
SEE THOSE DENTS?

1167
01:09:08,033 --> 01:09:11,000
THAT'S WHERE HE CUT
HIS EYETEETH.

1168
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:12,534
THERE.

1169
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:14,601
OH, WHAT A DOLL!

1170
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:16,234
MM-HMM.

1171
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,968
WELL, BARRING
SPROUTING WHISKERS

1172
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:20,467
AND WEARING
MORE CLOTHES,

1173
01:09:20,534 --> 01:09:23,334
HE HASN'T CHANGED
A GREAT DEAL, HAS HE?

1174
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,701
NO, NO, NOT A GREAT DEAL.

1175
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:28,767
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE IT?

1176
01:09:28,834 --> 01:09:31,000
OH, I'D GIVE IT
TO YOU IN A MINUTE.

1177
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:33,767
OH, I'D LOVE IT, IF
YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T MIND.

1178
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:35,968
I DON'T MIND.

1179
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:39,434
I'VE CARRIED HIM FOR
NIGH ONTO 25 YEARS.

1180
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:40,868
IT'S...

1181
01:09:40,934 --> 01:09:44,067
IT'S PAST TIME I WAS
GIVING HIM UP.

1182
01:09:45,467 --> 01:09:48,901
I'M GOING TO TRY
AND MAKE THE NEXT 25 YEARS

1183
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:52,934
JUST AS FULL OF LOVE AND
DEVOTION AS YOU'VE MADE THE PAST.

1184
01:09:54,934 --> 01:09:57,667
MY ONE PRAYER...

1185
01:09:57,734 --> 01:10:00,534
IS FOR HIS HAPPINESS.

1186
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:18,234
THE GLACIER QUEEN
OUGHT TO BE ALONG SOON.

1187
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,901
SHE'LL BE DOCKING
IN ABOUT TWO HOURS.

1188
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:29,100
YEAH,
PERHAPS IT HAS.

1189
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,267
SAY...

1190
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:34,300
BLOWING A GALE BEFORE
THE NIGHT'S OUT.

1191
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:37,100
HOPE ALEC WILL
HAVE SENSE-

1192
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:40,400
AW, DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
SMART KID, THAT.

1193
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:42,267
HMM.

1194
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:45,601
I HOPE WE DUMP
THIS STUFF AND GET IN.

1195
01:10:45,667 --> 01:10:49,067
I'LL TELL YOU, IT DOESN'T
LOOK SO GOOD TO ME.

1196
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:50,067
HEY, ANNIE.

1197
01:10:50,133 --> 01:10:51,767
WELL? WHAT'S
NIBBLING YOU, SAM?

1198
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:53,801
IT'S THEM LEAKY
BOILER TUBES AGAIN, ANNIE.

1199
01:10:53,868 --> 01:10:56,234
THEY GET TO SPITTING LIKE
A LOT OF FIGHTING TOMCATS.

1200
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,701
WE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THEM!

1201
01:10:57,767 --> 01:10:59,567
WELL, WE CAN'T DO
ANYTHING NOW.

1202
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:02,200
IT'S AN AWFUL JOB TRYING TO
KEEP UP THAT STEAM PRESSURE.

1203
01:11:02,267 --> 01:11:04,801
IT WE RUN INTO HEAVY
WEATHER OUTSIDE THE CAPE-

1204
01:11:04,868 --> 01:11:06,567
OH, WE AIN'T GOING
OUTSIDE TONIGHT.

1205
01:11:06,634 --> 01:11:09,000
I'M GONNA DUMP THIS
STUFF AT POINT ADAMS.

1206
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:12,234
IT DON'T LOOK GOOD, TERRY.
YOU GO AND TAKE THE WHEEL.

1207
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,033
LET SHIF'LESS GO DOWN AND
HELP SAM WITH THE FIRE.

1208
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,534
OH, ANNIE, I DON'T-

1209
01:11:16,601 --> 01:11:19,567
ON YOUR WAY, FISH EARS,
ON YOUR WAY.

1210
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:41,968
COPPER REEF,
BEARING SOU' BY EAST.

1211
01:11:42,033 --> 01:11:43,267
ONE HALF SOUTH, SIR.

1212
01:11:43,334 --> 01:11:44,601
VERY GOOD.

1213
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,767
WE'LL BRING HER BROAD ON
THE BEAM BEFORE WE SWING.

1214
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:49,167
I'LL BE GLAD WHEN WE'RE
INSIDE, THE WAY IT'S BLOWING UP.

1215
01:11:49,234 --> 01:11:50,601
YOU'RE RIGHT, SIR.

1216
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:52,868
AND THE WAY THAT
GLASS IS DROPPING.

1217
01:11:55,701 --> 01:11:56,634
WHAT'S THAT?

1218
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:02,434
LOOKS LIKE WE DROPPED A
PROPELLER. GET THE MEN ON STANDBY!

1219
01:12:02,501 --> 01:12:04,167
YES, SIR!

1220
01:12:04,234 --> 01:12:06,133
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

1221
01:12:07,767 --> 01:12:10,234
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM.

1222
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,734
BROKE A TAIL SHAFT.

1223
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:20,901
AND THE WIND
AND TIDES SETTING UP...

1224
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:22,901
CHIEF ENGINEER SAID
BROKEN TAIL SHAFT.

1225
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:24,901
YES, I KNOW. TELL
SPARKS I WANT TO SEE HIM.

1226
01:12:24,968 --> 01:12:26,067
YES, SIR!

1227
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,634
WE'LL BE BLOWN ON COPPER REEF
INSIDE OF AN HOUR.

1228
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:29,033
IS THERE NOTHING
WE CAN DO, SIR?

1229
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,067
TAKE OUT ALL HANDS AND GET
THE PASSENGERS INTO LIFE BELTS.

1230
01:12:31,133 --> 01:12:32,400
MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO PANIC.

1231
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:33,567
DON'T HESITATE!

1232
01:12:33,634 --> 01:12:34,567
YES, SIR!

1233
01:12:34,634 --> 01:12:36,601
HERE'S SPARKS NOW.

1234
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,100
SEND OUT AN S.O.S.

1235
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:41,100
I'LL GIVE YOU THE DOPE ON OUR
POSITION, WIND AND TIDE, AND SO ON.

1236
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:42,267
HURRY UP.
YES, SIR.

1237
01:12:42,334 --> 01:12:43,634
TELL THEM TO HURRY!

1238
01:12:43,701 --> 01:12:44,934
YES, SIR.

1239
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:53,033
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING OF THE
GLACIER QUEENYET, HAVEYOU?

1240
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,033
WELL, I'M WORRIED.

1241
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,000
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

1242
01:12:57,067 --> 01:13:00,200
WELL, IF SHE DOESN'T
HEAVE IN SIGHT SOON,

1243
01:13:00,267 --> 01:13:02,200
I'M GONNA CUT
THEM SCOWS LOOSE

1244
01:13:02,267 --> 01:13:03,868
AND START OUT
TO HUNT HER.

1245
01:13:03,934 --> 01:13:05,834
BUT, ANNIE,
YOU CAN'T. I MEAN-

1246
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:07,033
HE'S RIGHT, ANNIE.

1247
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,400
IF WE GO OUTSIDE THERE,
WE'LL FOUNDER.

1248
01:13:09,467 --> 01:13:11,734
ALEC'S JUST IDLING ALONG.

1249
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:15,467
OH, YEAH. JUST PICKING
DAISIES, I SUPPOSE.

1250
01:13:35,567 --> 01:13:36,734
TERRY!

1251
01:13:36,801 --> 01:13:39,501
IT'S A DISTRESS SIGNAL-
OFF COPPER REEF.

1252
01:13:43,267 --> 01:13:44,234
DO YOU SUPPOSE-

1253
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,734
AW, YOU'RE CRAZY!
IT CAN'T BE.

1254
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:49,234
IT IS! IT'S ALEC!
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED!

1255
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,534
AW, NO.

1256
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:53,400
CUT THE SCOWS LOOSE,
QUICK! QUICK!

1257
01:14:19,033 --> 01:14:21,067
SAM, IT'S TRUE!

1258
01:14:21,133 --> 01:14:22,734
GIVE HER ALL SHE'LL STAND,

1259
01:14:22,801 --> 01:14:24,734
IF YOU HAVE TO BUST
THE BOILER IN TWO!

1260
01:14:24,801 --> 01:14:27,067
SHE WON'T STAND MUCH.
THEM LEAKY TUBES, YOU KNOW.

1261
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:29,033
IF OUR PRESSURE
GOES DOWN,

1262
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,067
WE'RE GOING ASHORE
AS SURE AS JUDGMENT.

1263
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:34,000
STOP TALKING
AND DO AS I TELL YOU!

1264
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:46,567
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, SIR.

1265
01:14:46,634 --> 01:14:49,734
THAT VESSEL'S RUNNING LIGHT,
AND SHE'S COMING THIS WAY.

1266
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:51,634
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT!

1267
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:57,033
THAT VESSEL'S
GETTING CLOSER!

1268
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,200
KEEP THE FLARES
BURNING!

1269
01:14:58,267 --> 01:14:59,501
YES, SIR!

1270
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:06,868
IT'S THE NARCISSUS!

1271
01:15:06,934 --> 01:15:08,534
SHE'S TAKING
AN AWFUL CHANCE

1272
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:10,167
OF GETTING
SMASHED UP, SIR.

1273
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:11,834
THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

1274
01:15:11,901 --> 01:15:13,868
STAND BY TO
SHOOT THEM A LINE.

1275
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:15,200
MAKE IT SNAPPY!

1276
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:16,400
YES, SIR!

1277
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,734
ANNIE, YOU CAN'T GET A
LINE ABOARD IN THIS WIND.

1278
01:15:23,133 --> 01:15:24,400
LEAVE IT TO ME.

1279
01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:27,767
GO ON AFT AND BEND THE HAULING
LINE TO THE TOWING WIRE.

1280
01:16:57,167 --> 01:16:59,734
I HOPE THAT LINE
DON'T BREAK.

1281
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:12,701
ANNIE! ANNIE!
WE CAN'T STAND THIS.

1282
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:14,200
WELL, WHAT-

1283
01:17:14,267 --> 01:17:17,200
THEM LEAKY TUBES HAVE RUN THE
STEAM PRESSURE DOWN TO 40 POUNDS,

1284
01:17:17,267 --> 01:17:19,067
AND THEY JUST WON'T
STAND THE STRAIN!

1285
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:22,334
WE'LL BE ON THAT REEF OURSELVES IF
YOU DON'T CAST THAT LINER ADRIFT.

1286
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,334
I'D CAST MY BACK TEETH
FIRST! WE'RE HOLDING ON!

1287
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,033
BUT WE CAN'T!
IT'S SUICIDE!

1288
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,033
YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A HOLE
OF OUR OWN WITH THE WIND AND TIDE.

1289
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,033
YOU AIN'T GOT NO RIGHT
TO SACRIFICE US.

1290
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,868
WELL, WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO?

1291
01:17:34,934 --> 01:17:37,400
THEM LEAKY TUBES HAS
GOT TO BE PLUGGED.

1292
01:17:37,467 --> 01:17:39,734
CAST OFF THAT LINE,
AND WE'LL RUN OUTSIDE.

1293
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:42,400
WE'RE NOT GONNA
CAST OFF THE LINE!

1294
01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:45,234
TERRY! YOU GO
BELOW WITH SAM.

1295
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,534
I'LL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

1296
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:50,300
WE'RE NOT CASTING OFF
THAT LINE.

1297
01:18:03,467 --> 01:18:06,234
ALL RIGHT, PUT ON
THAT WIRE, GUS!

1298
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:13,167
TERRY, GO THROUGH THAT FIREBOX
TO THE BACK CONNECTIONS,

1299
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:14,534
BACK OF THE BOILERS.

1300
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:17,167
I'LL PASS THE STOPPER
ON THROUGH TO YOU.

1301
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:21,000
YOU TAKE THOSE NUTS, SCREW THEM
TIGHT ON THE OTHER END OF THE ROD.

1302
01:18:21,067 --> 01:18:22,801
THAT'LL STOP THE STEAM
FROM LEAKING.

1303
01:18:22,868 --> 01:18:24,834
WE CAN GET
OUR PRESSURE UP AGAIN.

1304
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:26,200
OK.

1305
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:29,567
YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK FAST,
OR WE'LL ALL BE ON THE REEF.

1306
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,033
THE TUG'S
NOT HOLDING US.

1307
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:39,000
THAT WAS TOO MUCH
TO EXPECT, SIR.

1308
01:18:42,267 --> 01:18:44,467
HELLO, ANNIE.

1309
01:18:44,534 --> 01:18:45,901
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1310
01:18:45,968 --> 01:18:49,133
I'M GOING DOWN AND FIX UP
THEM TUBES THERE.

1311
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,868
HEY, YOU CAN'T
GO IN THERE.

1312
01:18:51,934 --> 01:18:54,234
AW, IT'S GOT TO

1313
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,334
WELL, ALL RIGHT. LET SHIF'LESS
OR GUS OR SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT.

1314
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,334
AW, I CAN DO IT JUST
LIKE THAT. LET'S GO, SAM.

1315
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,667
NO, YOU'RE NOT
GOING IN THERE.

1316
01:19:01,734 --> 01:19:03,000
LET ME GO, WILL YOU?

1317
01:19:03,067 --> 01:19:04,734
YOU WANT ME TO
PUSH YOU IN THE NOSE?

1318
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:07,834
LISTEN. IT'S FOR
OUR KID, AIN'T IT?

1319
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:09,667
WELL...

OH, NO, YOU CAN'T GO

01:20:18,968 --> 01:20:23,033

TAKE CARE
OF HIM, ANNIE.

1356
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,901
I GOT TO STIR
OUR FIRES AGAIN.

1357
01:22:20,968 --> 01:22:24,067
OK.
TERRY, SPEAK TO ME!

1358
01:22:36,033 --> 01:22:37,501
SHE'S HOLDING US!

1359
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:41,567
YOU'RE RIGHT, SIR!

1360
01:22:41,634 --> 01:22:44,200
SHE IS HOLDING US.

1361
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,868
TERRY?

1362
01:22:49,934 --> 01:22:51,100
TERRY.

1363
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:53,601
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1364
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:59,200
WHAT ARE YOU SNIFFLING FOR,
YOU OLD PORPOISE?

1365
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:02,334
SURE, I'M ALL RIGHT.

1366
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,467
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT.

1367
01:23:05,534 --> 01:23:07,033
GO ON.

1368
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:10,033
IT WAS FOR OUR KID,
WASN'T IT?

1369
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:14,400
YEAH.

1370
01:23:15,934 --> 01:23:17,300
TERRY...

1371
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:22,400
I'M ALL RIGHT,
ANNIE.

1372
01:23:22,467 --> 01:23:24,734
STOP
YOUR WORRYING.

1373
01:23:24,801 --> 01:23:27,767
I'M ALL RIGHT.

1374
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:33,100
IT WAS NICE OF YOU
TO COME, ALEC,

1375
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:36,901
AND THE
YOUNG LADY, TOO.

1376
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:41,234
WE BRENNANS KNOW HOW
TO PICK OUR WOMEN.

1377
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:44,300
BUT WHAT
YOU WAITING FOR?

1378
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:46,601
YOUR MOM AND ME
WAS MARRIED

1379
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:49,100
TWO WEEKS
AFTER WE MET.

1380
01:23:49,167 --> 01:23:54,767
YOU ALWAYS WAS A
FASCINATING DEVIL, TERRY.

1381
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:59,367
WE'LL HAVE
A GRAND WEDDING.

1382
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:02,234
I'LL GIVE
THE BRIDE AWAY.

1383
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,367
WHY, HE'LL BE
UP AND AROUND

1384
01:24:04,434 --> 01:24:07,334
AND OUT AT HIS OLD
TRICKS BEFORE ANYTIME.

1385
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,234
SAY, TERRY,

1386
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:14,200
YOU KNOW, THE STEAMSHIP COMPANY
IS GOING TO BUY THE NARCISSUS

1387
01:24:14,267 --> 01:24:19,367
AND FIX HER UP ALL BRAND-NEW
AND GIVE HER BACK TO US.

1388
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,033
PRESENTING YOU
WITH THIS MEDAL

1389
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,567
IS A GREAT
PLEASURE, TERRY.

1390
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:36,567
BUT IT GIVES ME
GREATER PLEASURE,

1391
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:38,434
ON BEHALF
OF MY COMPANY,

1392
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,567
TO GIVE YOU BACK
THE NARCISSUS.

1393
01:24:40,634 --> 01:24:43,234
OH!
