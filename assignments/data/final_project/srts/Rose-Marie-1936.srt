00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,749
He said to my father,
he said, "Hello, Happy."

166
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,707
I thought that was strange.

167
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:34,058
Nobody ever called him "Happy."
He knew those kind of people.

168
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,540
He lived in that kind of a world.

169
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,979
I found out later that
his nickname was "Happy Hank."

170
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,591
My father used to go into these places

171
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:48,812
and... and burn up the place
if you didn't join the union,

172
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:51,598
you know, those kind of guys.

173
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,600
He wasn't very important.

174
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,429
He was one of the "Do this
and do that guys."

175
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,693
But they knew him as "Happy Hank."

176
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,696
He also ran the Diana Ballroom,

177
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,611
which is where my mother met him.

178
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:07,048
She loved to dance.
She was a wild little girl.

179
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,832
She was crazy.

180
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,530
And that's where she met my father.

181
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,749
But anyway I looked at Al Capone.

182
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,622
He was very strange looking. He was heavy.

183
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,841
He wore a dark suit, well-dressed,

184
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:19,539
very well-dressed.

185
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,541
Hat on the side.

186
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,196
"The boys want to meet the kid."

187
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,503
The doorman is white.

188
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,940
And he says, "You know who that is?"

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,162
And we got in the car and went to Cicero,

190
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,730
which is out of Chicago a little bit.

191
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,650
And we walked into this mansion,

192
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,784
which was... didn't belong there,
this mansion.

193
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,438
It really didn't belong there.

194
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,135
It was out of place.

195
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:54,855
And the dining room was
as long as you could see.

196
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,926
And so all the guys were there,

197
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,209
all the big guys were there.

198
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:06,673
And they all came over to me
and gave me a hug

199
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:09,414
and said "We think you're
wonderful, we love you,

200
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,242
"and we're glad to meet you."

201
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,288
And I said, "Thank you."

202
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,029
They went back to the table,

203
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,553
and Al gave me a dinner ring
with three diamonds in it,

204
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,555
which I still have,

205
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,905
and picked me up in his arms and said,

206
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:25,256
"You call me Uncle Al
from now on. You understand?"

207
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,061
And I said, "Yeah, Uncle Al."

208
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:31,567
Okay, and he says, "Anything you need,

209
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,830
"anything you want you call me."

210
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,310
Turned to my father, he says,

211
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,419
"We'll take care of her from here on in."

212
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:42,250
And out we went back to the theater.

213
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:47,061
I think she should've been managed better

214
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,845
when she was young.

215
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,978
My mother was the force

216
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:53,763
of me liking it and doing it.

217
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,939
My father would run the show.

218
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,290
My father was boss, and he was a mean man.

219
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,641
I disliked my father intensely

220
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,078
because my father had another family.

221
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,471
I was born illegitimately.

222
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,605
My father had another family
going with two kids,

223
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,695
same names as my brother and I.

224
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:17,047
He was a rough, gruff man

225
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,963
who was going to take advantage
of his property.

226
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:22,444
And his property was Baby Rose Marie.

227
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,055
The minute I won the contest

228
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,883
and we went to Atlantic City

229
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,407
and I started working the different places,

230
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:31,192
he knew there was a buck there.

231
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:34,412
And he took charge, he ran everything.

232
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:37,372
He was my manager, my agent, everything.

233
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:41,855
And I was making thousands,
and my father took it all.

234
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,421
At the height of success,

235
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,075
Baby Rose Marie was making

236
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:47,251
over a thousand dollars a performance.

237
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,427
Her voice landed her big jobs

238
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:52,039
not just on radio but theatrical cartoons

239
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,780
like Betty Boop.

240
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,913
There's no way to know
how much money her father made,

241
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,481
but it's millions of dollars
in today's currency.

242
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:02,440
And Ro, she never saw a penny.

243
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,879
I had no idea that my career was building.

244
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,186
I just loved what I did.
I did it without question.

245
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,667
I never said, "No, I don't want
to do that."

246
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,495
I loved every bit of it.

247
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:17,542
In fact, I still love it today.
I really love it today.

248
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:21,329
Work meant everything.
Work meant everything.

249
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,766
And to do your best meant everything.

250
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:27,030
To always be at your best.

251
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,730
And she never went onstage without this.

252
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,515
And she had great respect for an audience,

253
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:37,040
which is something that
you don't see anymore.

254
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,086
Because I loved to work for an audience,

255
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,870
and I loved to hold 'em

256
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,959
in the palm of my hand, which I do.

257
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,091
That's the secret.

258
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,618
I was now about 14.

An awkward age, very awkward.

261

Not a lady, not a grown-up, not a child.

262
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,758
I was an in-between

Now ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for a song

from Baby Rose Marie.

267
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,770
But first, ladies and gentlemen,

268
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,642
I would like to tell you
that she no longer is a baby.

269
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:16,514
For today she's a grown-up
lovely young lady,

270
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,779
and we call her Miss Rose Marie.

♪

272
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:26,089
I was only 16, 17 years old.

273
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:31,747
And I started playing theaters
in and around New York.

274
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,923
And I played the Roxy Theater.

275
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,578
I played the Capitol Theater on Broadway.

276
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:39,775
Till I started doing nightclub work.

277
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:46,196
With Prohibition now over,

278
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,677
when the sun went down Americans flocked

279
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:51,462
to the nightclubs.

280
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:56,293

Behind the curtain,

282
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,775
the biggest mobsters of the time.

283
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:03,561
When I played the Copacabana in New York,

284
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,737
I was sitting with some friends,

285
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:08,740
and the maitre d' came over,
Lopez, and he said,

"Mr. Fisher wants to see you."

287

"Oh," I said. "Oh, okay."

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,061
And I said, "Excuse me,"
and I went up to the lounge,

292
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:28,064
and there was Joe Fischetti.

293
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:31,894
Joe Fischetti, Chicago gangster,

294
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,330
cousin of Al Capone,

the man who would later get Frank Sinatra

investigated by the FBI.

297

And I said, "Why didn't you
tell me you changed your name?"

298
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,949
He says, "Never mind, at least you came up.

"No." "Want something to eat?" "No."

"Okay." "Where you working next?"

00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:08,061
I was going from one place to another

310
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,909
all because of the boys.

311

They were absolutely wonderful to me.

312
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,267
That era was the best era.

313
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,096
You had to work. You just didn't
go in and do a TV show.

314
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,880
You went from Buffalo to Cleveland.

315
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,815
You really had to work hard.

316
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:07,859
With World II on,
Americans needed an escape,

317
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,429
which kept performers
like Rose Marie busy as hell.

318

321
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,921
He says, "You were very good."
He says, "I enjoyed it."

322
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,444
I said, "Thank you."

323
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,707
That soldier was a trumpet player

324

named Bobby Guy.

325
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,583
He started like everybody

326
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:40,327
playing jobs in bars in little bands.

327
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,155
And he gradually worked up

328
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:45,506
till he played with Kay Kyser,

329
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,638
who had a very popular radio show

330
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:51,164
called "Kay Kyser's College
of Musical Knowledge."

331
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,340
And Bobby played first trumpet.

332
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,753
♪

333
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,220
Bobby was then drafted,

334
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,396
landing him a gig in the U.S. Army Band

335
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,833
and a transfer to New York City.

336
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:12,098
And I went home,
I started thinking about him.

337
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,926
I said, "He's weird, you know.
He's very weird."

338
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:19,453
The next night I went in,
he was sitting there.

339
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,456
So, now I go home the second night,

340
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:25,502
the next morning I get a telegram saying:

341
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:27,069
"Caught your act.

342
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,637
"Need new material
and can book you four weeks

343
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,595
"on the Gus Sun Time."

344
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,206
Which broke me up

345
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:37,427
because that was strictly a funny telegram.

346
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,560
And I get into the club that night,

347
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,824
I said, "I got your wire."
"Oh, did you know it was me?"

348
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,565
I said, "Yeah, I knew it was you."

349
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:48,047
One of my best girlfriends,
Jerri, came down with me,

350
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,918
and I introduced her to Bobby.

351
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,790
I said, "How do you like him?"
She says, "He's all right."

352
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,184
I said, "That's the man I'm gonna marry."

353
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:56,751
She says, "Are you kidding?

354
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,405
"You're going to marry that fat sergeant?

355
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,233
"You only knew him three days."

356
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:04,106
I said, "He's not fat."
I said, "He's just chubby.

357
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,500
"Yes, that's the man I'm gonna marry."

358
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,806
"How do you know?" "I don't
know, I'm just telling you.

359
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:11,070
"That's the man I'm gonna marry."

360
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,985
Bobby was full-bodied.

361
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,552
He was chunky.

362
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,641
He didn't look fat,

363
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:21,732
but he didn't look like a muscle builder

364
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,908
with a big smile.

365
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:27,042
She was crazy in love with him,

366
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:31,133
and he was crazy in love with her.

367
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:35,268
And Frank was absolutely panicking

368
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:38,662
that she was going
to get married and go away.

369
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,403
And there was a lot of problems.

370
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,492
We get a little more friendly,

371
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:44,015
then he says to me,

372
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,540
"Gene Krupa opens up after you close here.

373
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,281
"Would you like to come to the opening?"

374
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:51,153
I said, "I'd love to."

375
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,329
And on the way over to Gene Krupa's,

376
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:57,159
this is a week and a half, maybe two weeks,

377
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,684
he says "I'm gonna get out
of the army soon."

378
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,686
He says, "I got to go back to California.

379
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:05,472
"That's where my clothes are.
That's where my horns are.

380
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,648
"I don't know what's ahead,

381
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:09,563
"but if you're willing
I'd like you to go with me

382
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,434
"and be with me."

383
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,523
I said, "Is that a proposal?"

384
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,656
He says, "Yes."

385
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,920
"You're asking me to marry you?" "Yes."

386
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,836
"By telling me you're going
to California, that's it?"

387
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:25,100
He says, "That's it. Do you want to go?"

388
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,058
"You mean do I want to marry you?"

389
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:29,191
I remember this conversation word for word.

390
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,474
I said, "Fine."

391
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:38,505
I remember she was working
at the Capitol Theater

392
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,724
doing four or five a day.

393
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:46,252
And Frank had cops
outside and in the theater

394
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:50,125
looking for him to come in
and have him arrested.

395
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,474
Arrested for what, I don't know.

396
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,128
What are you going to arrest him for?

397
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:57,263
But he was that vicious about Bobby Guy.

398
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,874
Bobby came to pick me up,

399
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,355
and we walked down Madison Avenue

400
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:06,141
window shopping and stuff
but just having a great time.

401
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:08,274
And I got into NBC,

402
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:11,015
and Bobby used to wait for me downstairs.

403
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,279
He wouldn't come up.

404
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:17,196
When Bobby was waiting
at the corner of 52nd Street,

405
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,503
he was holding
onto the lamp post like this.

406
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,418
My father came up to him
like this and said,

407
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,638
"You sonofabitch, you stay out of our life.

408
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,205
"I'm going to kill you, you no good..."

409
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,729
And he called him every name in the book.

410
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:31,645
By now, a crowd had gotten around.

411
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,082
And everybody kept saying,
"Hit him, soldier.

412
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,562
"Hit him, soldier."

413
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,216
And he kept saying, "You no good SB,

414
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,956
"you this and that and this thing."

415
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:41,437
And Bobby just kept holding back
like this and saying,

416
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:43,439
"He's her father, he's her father,

417
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,920
"I can't do anything, he's her father."

418
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,617
"You stay away from my daughter

419
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:49,924
"or so help me God I'll kill
the... out of you."

420
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,491
And the only way she got away

421
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,884
was she and Bobby eloped.

422
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:55,950
Otherwise, he wouldn't let her go.

423
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:00,456
I called my girlfriend Jerri, I said,

424
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:04,373
"Listen, you got to help me.
I'm eloping tomorrow."

425
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:06,767
And she said, "Oh my God.

426
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,334
"Come to the house tonight,

427
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,554
"under my window I will
throw you out my suitcases

428
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,469
"full of clothes."

429
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,819
Sure enough, she came that night.

430
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,083
I opened my window, I threw
my suitcases out the window.

431
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:23,653
We got married in City Hall,
and every time the judge says,

432
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,612
"Is any reason this should not go through?"

433
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,614
I thought my father was going to bust in

434
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,006
and say "Whoa!" you know.

435
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,617
But he didn't.

436
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:34,751
I got married. Wedding night... mm-hmm.

437
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,322
And he went to AAA and got a list of hotels

438
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,106
and how far it was from this hotel

439
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:45,109
to that hotel to this hotel and that hotel,

440
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:47,590
which was all news to me.

441
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,551
On the way, I would call up
people that I knew.

442
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:53,466
I remember Scarpelli,

443
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:56,730
one of the bosses,
one of the big mob bosses,

444
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,645
he's a big guy like this.

445
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:03,040
He and his wife Kay had become
very friendly with me

446
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,347
and my father, you know.

447
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,480
And she said, "Your father called.

448
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,395
"Stay out of Chicago.

449
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:12,485
"They're looking for you in Chicago."

450
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:14,225
She says, "Come here to St. Louis."

451
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:21,276
Because I had worked the Chase Hotel there.

452
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,627
Now I get ready to go
to the bathroom with Kay,

453
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:27,456
and my husband is left alone with Jim.

454
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:30,154
Jim says, "You know her father called."

455
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,461
He says, "You hurt one hair on her head,"

456
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:36,117
and he banged the table,
the whole table shook.

457
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:38,249
Bobby was scared, so scared.

458
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:40,861
We come out of the ladies room, you know,

459
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,515
and I'm looking at him,
and he's looking at me,

460
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,560
and he's going "Ohhhh..."

461
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,954
And when we got out of there
and they said goodnight,

462
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,825
we went up to the room and he says,

463
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:51,480
"I've never been through
anything like that in my life."

464
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,961
He said, "Thought for sure
I was gonna get shot."

465
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:57,201
And we started on our honeymoon.

469
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:22,163

470
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:25,775
"We're going to find these
all the way to the coast."

471
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,690
Now, I had never been to a motel.

472
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,779

We didn't know what we were gonna do,

478
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:50,409

00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,638
and stopped whenever we wanted to stop,

483
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:06,120
stay overnight whenever
we wanted to stay overnight.

484
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,558
♪ And would I be sure

485
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:16,435
♪ That this is love beyond compare ♪

486
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,002
♪ Would all this be true

487
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:22,702
We had no idea what was in store for us.

488
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:26,290
We just had a fantastic honeymoon.

489
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,408
My father swore up and down

490
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,932
that I was going to support my husband,

491
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:38,152
which I never did.

492
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,762
Never in a million years.

493
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:41,590
He wasn't that kind of man.

494
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,158
He had his own right, his own position

495
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,334
and his own name.

496
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:49,816
He was Bing Crosby's first trumpet player.

497
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:54,429
Bing Crosby's show was incredibly popular.

498
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:56,126
Next to Jack Benny, it was probably

499
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:59,478
the most popular radio show on the air.

500
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,306
And the way they opened that radio show

501
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:07,050
was Bob... was the trumpet, solo trumpet.

502
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,054
And if you could imagine yourself being

503
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:14,667
sitting with a cold piece
of brass like this,

504
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:19,498
and you're called upon
when somebody goes "Now"

505
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,413
coast to coast, nationwide

506
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,459
you played the theme, you started the theme

507
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:27,656
all by yourself sort of like this.

508
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:48,788
♪ Someone waits for me

509
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:53,444
And then the show was on.

510
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:54,576
Ladies and gentlemen,

511
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,099
our first guest for this evening

512
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,101
is a very charming young lady.

513
00:25:58,121 --> 00:26:00,843
Very talented too,
a smash dynamite vocalist.

514
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,453
Started out in show business, this girl,

515
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,194
when she was just a baby.

516
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,809
See apparently Bobby Guy,
our trumpet player,

517
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,593
is doing his best to give you

518
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,986
some sort of a big send-off, Rose Marie.

519
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:14,770
He must be a fan of yours or something.

520
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,816
Well, I don't know how much of a fan he is,

521
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:18,252
but he is my husband.

522
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:24,563
I think anybody that ever
put my father on a job

523
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,391
knew that he had a special sound.

524
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:30,481
And I can still hear it to this day.

525
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,875
I know what records he's on.

526
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:35,617
I know what movies he's on.

527
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:39,708
It was unlike any other
trumpet player in this town.

528
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,493
Boy, he was something else.

529
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:46,149
Jerry Lewis was a very good
friend of my father's.

530
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,850
Jerry had heard this one song
called "Too Late Blues."

531
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,416
My father does a solo on it,

532
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:55,463
and it is the most exquisite piece of music

533
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:58,074
you will ever hear a trumpet player play.

534
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,685
Whenever my father was available,

535
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,687
he was on a Jerry Lewis film.

536
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:05,038
He was liked, and he was respected

537
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,563
for who he was, what he was,
and how he played.

538
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,914
And he was... the best.

539
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,568
Just the opposite of Rose Marie.

540
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:17,485
He was a rock, an awfully sweet, sweet guy.

541
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:20,096
He never strove to be like a star.

542
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:24,710
He was quite happy
showing up, playing the job,

543
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,451
going home.

544
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,412
I was out here in California,

545
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:34,154
and I had done the Rudy Vallée show.

546
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:37,592
And somebody said, "You've got
to work at Slapsy Maxie's."

547
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:40,508
That wastheclub at that time.

548
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:43,119
My husband says, "You know
you're going to have to do

549
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,555
"about an hour"

550
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,906
because I used to do about 30 minutes,

551
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:49,865
35 minutes, three or four songs,
that was it.

552
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,301
I said, "Why?"

553
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,782
"Because you're gonna be on all alone.

554
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:57,568
"There's gonna be no comic,
gonna be no nothing, just you."

555
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:02,530
No female was doing comedy
at that time. Nobody.

556
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,838
And little by little
I was doing comedy in my act,

557
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:09,165
singing and getting
more and more into comedy.

558
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:14,411
My reviews opened up

559
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,675
with "She's someone to be reckoned with.

560
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,328
"This young lady with the beautiful gowns

561
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,679
"and the gorgeous hair
and all this and that."

562
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,897
"She's a hell of a performer."

563
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,421
I couldn't write a better review.

564
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:25,791
I couldn't write one.

565
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:39,718
And now everybody was calling
to work and this and that.

566
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,794
One night a guy came in

567
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:53,276
who owned "The Hollywood Reporter."

568
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,932
He said, "Saw your show,
we want you to open in Vegas."

569
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:59,326
I said, "What's Vegas?"

570
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,763
He says, "We want you to open
with Xavier Cugat

571
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,199
"and Jimmy Durante."

572
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:06,725
I said, "Jimmy! To work with Jimmy?!

573
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,552
"Oh my God, that would be wonderful!"

Stop the music. Stop the music!

589
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,747
And now I get ready for Vegas.

590
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:58,559
Las Vegas as a city was nothing.

591
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:01,736
It was desert, all desert.

592
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:03,390
We had one cab driver on the whole strip.

593
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,870
His name was Louie.

594
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,568
And if you drank you didn't want to drive.

595
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,048
So you hired Louie.

596
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:11,615
The strip was just The El Rancho,

597
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:14,444
The Last Frontier, The Desert Inn,

598
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,751
and The Flamingo, that was it.

599
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:19,101
And Vegas, as it exists today,

600
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:23,366
is all because of The Flamingo.

601
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:26,848
Gangster Bugsy Siegel
and his partner Billy Wilkerson

602
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:29,590
set out to build
the highest class casino resort

603
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,722
in the U.S.

604
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:32,941
The Flamingo was

605
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,203
an unbelievable thing to everybody.

606
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,639
They were afraid of it.

607
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,728
Neon lights and bright lights and this.

608
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,992
It was like Monte Carlo.

609
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:43,996
The rest was all sand.

610
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:46,259
Ro opened The Flamingo.

611
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,478
She opened it with... for Bugsy Siegel.

612
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:50,567
Bugsy Siegel was very good to me.

613
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:52,482
He was very sweet to me.

614
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:55,964
His girlfriend, Virginia Hill,
he called her "The Flamingo."

615
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,836
That's why that club
was called The Flamingo.

616
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,142
Nobody knew that.

617
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:02,057
A little secret.

618
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:05,191
Bugsy thought of The Flamingo
as a place in Vegas,

619
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:08,237
and the mob loaned him two million dollars.

620
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:10,761
And he kept saying "I need more money"

621
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:14,504
because the locals took him
for every dime he could get.

622
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,202
They did everything wrong

623
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:17,812
so they could fix it over again

624
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:19,596
and do this and do that.

625
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:22,382
So, the mob got mad and said,
"No more money."

626
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:24,036
The building costs soared

627
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,081
to over six million dollars,

628
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:29,084
all borrowed from the East Coast mob.

629
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:33,828
Now his life literally depended
on the success of this building.

630
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:37,397
And everything depended on opening night.

631
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,617
I was supposed to open tomorrow.

632
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:42,315
It rains.

633
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:45,622
One plane to Vegas does not take off.

634
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,712
There's only one plane to Vegas then.

635
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:51,454
In the morning, everybody
was on that plane.

636
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:58,157
Xavier Cugat, Abbe Lane,
Tommy Wonder, Jimmy Durante.

637
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,767
Despite the bad weather,

638
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:01,812
the Hollywood elite showed up.

639
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:04,206
Opening night, the place is jammed.

640
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:06,382
Lana Turner, Clark Gable, Barbara Stanwyck.

641
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:08,776
We had a hell of a crowd.

642
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:12,475
The show was wonderful. It was brilliant.

643
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,696
The next night they were all there again.

644
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:18,264
The third night, they were gone.

645
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:21,354
Everybody went back to California,

646
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:24,096
and we worked to nine people.

647
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:26,054
And, if you want to see something sad,

648
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,337
you watch Jimmy Durante
work to nine people.

649
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:32,626
First week, I'm sitting in the coffee shop

650
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:34,889
with the dancer, Tommy Wonder.

651
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:36,673
We're having a cup of tea,

652
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:39,111
and this man comes in,

653
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,983
and "Here's your check."

654
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,855
I look at my check,
and there's $11 missing.

655
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:49,512
I said, "Wait a minute, psst!
Come here, please. Sir!

656
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:53,038
"You took $11 out of my check.
Tell me what's that for?"

657
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,953
Tommy Wonder, he's exhausted.

658
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,172
He goes: "Do you know who that was?"

659
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,740
And I said, "No." He says,
"That's Bugsy Siegel."

660
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,524
I said, "Oh my God,

661
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,265
"they're gonna pick me up in an envelope."

662
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:05,354
"How dare you talk to him like that."

663
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:06,790
I didn't know who he was.

664
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,792
A few minutes later, he came back.

665
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:12,057
He says, "Here's your $11.
I'm sorry about the mistake."

666
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:14,842
Sweetest man in the world.

667
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:17,758
$11.

668
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:22,850
Little did she know that Bugsy
lost $3,000 that first week.

669
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,158
But he didn't give up.

670
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,550
He bet it all on The Flamingo

671
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,423
and was determined to see it succeed

672
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,991
with Rose Marie as his star.

673
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,514
One night,

674
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,907
Bugsy Siegel came over to me and said,

675
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:41,129
"Here's $10,000. Go play some baccarat."

676
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:44,524
I said, "I'm not a shill. I'm a performer."

677
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:47,048
"Yeah, but if you get up there
and start playing,

678
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,310
"maybe people will come to the table

679
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,791
"and start playing with you."

680
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,793
"I don't do this." He says, "Do it for me."

681
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,142
I said, "Okay."

682
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:56,014
I go over there, and sure enough

683
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,495
playing with somebody else's
money I won $25,000.

684
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:01,976
And now the second show is gonna go,

685
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:03,282
and I've got to go on.

686
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:05,458
What do I do with this $25,000?

687
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:09,201
I can't find him. Where the hell is he?

688
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,072
I finally put the $25,000 down here,

689
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,595
I do my second show.

690
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:22,040
I come back, and he's sitting
in the coffee shop there.

691
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,954
I said, "Where have you been?"

692
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:26,000
"Mr. Siegel," I said, "I am not a shill.

693
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,134
"Here's your damn money.
Don't ever do this to me again."

694
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:31,179
And he laughed, he says,

695
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,703
"You'll be playing here
quite a bit, you're all right."

696
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:36,663
I'll never forget that.
He says, "You're all right."

697
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,447
He says, "And we'll be seeing you again."

698
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,841
I said, "Thank you, Mr. Siegel,
it's been a pleasure."

699
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:42,843
Got my check, and I left.

700
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:44,995
And five days later he was killed.

701
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:50,285
And then Bugsy had the last laugh

702
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,853
because it was... he's still
turning in his grave

703
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:54,898
because it turned out to be quite...

704
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,031
Look at Vegas today.

705
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:59,599
Vegas today is unbelievable.

706
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:03,472
So little by little
they were building hotels,

707
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:05,692
and every time they built a hotel

708
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:07,563
one of the boys was behind it.

709
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,174
All the guys from Cleveland,

710
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,959
Moe Dalitz and Tucker Brothers
and all those guys

711
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,526
came in and took over.

712
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,267
Thank goodness because they were

713
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,399
the most wonderful guys
in the world to work for.

714
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:20,620
I can't tell you how terrific they were.

715
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,276
You're working for the mob,
the so-called mob.

716
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:25,712
If you were a good kid

717
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:28,323
and you didn't get out of line or drink

718
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,934
or go after their women or gamble,

719
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,372
the world was anything you wanted.

720
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:36,940
You never paid for anything.
Thank God for Vegas.

721
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,247
Without Vegas, I don't know how
I'd have raised my family.

722
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:42,337
Each mob had their own area.

723
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:45,688
And I played them all,
and we became very good friends.

724
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:49,475
They looked after me and thought
I was the cat's meow.

725
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,390
Once in a while, she would mention

726
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,609
some of the tough guys she knew back then.

727
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:56,134
Moe Sedgway, Doc Mangini,

728
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:01,269
Jerry Maloney, Blackjack,
Willie the Icepick.

729
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,705
That's a good one.

730
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:04,881
Killed with the ice pick like that.

731
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,622
They treated her like a daughter.

732
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,930
They didn't treat her like a girlfriend

733
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,324
or somebody they're gonna have sex with.

734
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:15,153
They treated her like somebody
they were trying to protect

735
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,590
and take care of and be good to.

736
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,157
And I knew all of them

737
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,942
and used to hang out with all of them.

738
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:27,817
And but I always said I'm a Flamingo girl.

739
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:30,777
Bugsy... his girlfriend Virginia Hill

740
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,040
said to me "Your show is wonderful,

741
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,607
your gowns are beautiful."

742
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:37,087
I said, "I have this very famous designer

743
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:39,786
"in New York that makes... he's a Frenchman.

744
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:42,919
"He's fantastic."
She said, "They're gorgeous."

745
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:45,400
But she says, "I think you
should lose a little weight."

746
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,883
I said, "Don't tell anybody,
but I'm five months pregnant."

747
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:52,146
She says, "You're kidding." I said, "No."

748
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:56,019
The gowns still fit,
but I'm a little overweight.

749
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,608
I say, "As soon as I have
the baby, I'll lose the weight."

750
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:05,464
In 1947, Rose Marie
and Bobby welcomed a daughter,

751
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:07,727
Georgiana Marie Guy,

752
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:11,165
affectionately nicknamed Noopy.

753
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:14,212
For a decade, Rose Marie
traveled the United States

754
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,607
headlining various nightclubs and theaters.

755
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:21,567
I think my mother was
on the road most of the time

756
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:23,351
in my early years.

757
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:26,224
Not typical behavior for a '50s housewife.

758
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,793
So, when they could, her family came along.

759
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,665
When I was about four years old,

760
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:35,233
Sam Levinson called up my mother and said

761
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,148
he would like to have me on the show.

762
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:40,063
What's your mommy's name, darling?

763
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,543
Rose Marie.

764
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:43,328
Ladies and gentlemen, from the movies,

765
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:48,463
from TV and from "Top Banana,"
we bring you Rose Marie.

766
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,379
So I got on national television,

767
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:54,469
and I sang "Top Banana."

768
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,776
I had a father that was a musician

769
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:59,866
and a mother that was a singer,
so I better have a good voice.

770
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:04,784
♪ If you want to be a top banana ♪

771

00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:25,283
I'll talk about "Top Banana" now.

778
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,811
I got a call from Phil Silvers.

779
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,769
In the late '50s, the army sitcom

780
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:36,424
"The Phil Silvers Show" would
make him a household name.

781
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,208
But at this time he was

782
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:40,210
just a character actor working for MGM.

783
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,213
He says, "I want
you to do a Broadway show."

784
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:44,911
"Phil, I live in California.

785
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,956
"I can't come here and live in New York

786
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:50,177
"with my husband and baby in California."

787
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,310
He says, "They can come in and visit you.

788
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,965
"But you need a Broadway show.
I want you to do this show.

789
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:59,142
"I want you to do this show, please."

790
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:01,231
I said, "All right, send me a script."

791
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:03,973
I had wonderful numbers.

792
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:06,846
The duet with Phil and myself,
"A Word A Day,"

793
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:08,978
stopped the show every night.

794
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:11,566
We did the show. The show was a smash.

795
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:17,770
The reviews came out,
it was all about Phil.

796
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,598
Not one of us got mentioned.

797
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:21,904
Not one of us.

798
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:26,953
I'm sitting at Sardi's very depressed.

799
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:30,043
Marlon Brando comes over to me

800
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:32,306
and says, "What's the matter?"

801
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:34,047
I said, "It didn't even mention me."

802
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,049
He says, "I saw the show tonight.

803
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,442
"You were great.

804
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,139
"You stopped the show four times."

805
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,011
I said, "I know, but they
didn't even mention me."

806
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:45,363
He says, "F 'em." He says, "You were great.

807
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,408
"I was there, remember that."

808
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,648
And he walked away.

809
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,937
All that "Top Banana"
hype earned Phil Silvers

810
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,635
a Tony award for his performance

811
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,464
and solidified the show as a hit.

812
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:02,554
They made it into a movie

813
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,730
when the show was very successful.

814
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,732
Phil Silvers kept calling me.

815
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:08,647
He says, "I want you to do the movie."

816
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,824
What can I say? It was not good, period.

817
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:14,304
That's just about the size of it.

818
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:19,005
I had a producer that wanted to make fun

819
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:22,617
and give me an offer,
which I tried to refuse.

820
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,794
It was a dirty offer. Want me to tell you?

821
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:28,536
The producer comes over to me and says,

822
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:33,149
"I'll show you a few positions
if you're interested."

823
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:35,151
And I said, "Oh, that's funny.

824
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:37,632
"Oh yeah, you're wonderful, that's funny."

825
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:39,634
"I'm serious, this could be your picture."

826
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:42,071
And in front of everybody I go,

827
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:44,596
"You couldn't get it up if a flag went by."

828
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:47,903
Which didn't sit too well with him.

829
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:50,471
All my numbers were cut in the picture.

830
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,213
There isn't one number of me
in the picture.

831
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:56,303
I think my mother's
experience of doing the film

832
00:40:56,323 --> 00:41:01,264
of "Top Banana" pushed her
away from wanting to do movies.

833
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:05,573
Finally I decided
I got to get into television.

834
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:09,664
I got to do some television.
That's the thing to do today.

835
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:13,276
In 1950, only 9% of American households

836
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:14,974
owned television sets.

837
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:18,630
But by 1957 that number grew to 78%.

838
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,110
What was first thought of as a novelty

839
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,548
quickly became one of the most
influential inventions

840
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,178
in the history of entertainment.

841
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:30,400
And they said,
"You've got to get an agent."

842
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:36,865
Jim Maloney, I go and see him

843
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:39,781
with my reviews from Slapsy Maxie's.

844
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:42,654
I'm a good actress, I do comedy.

845
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,830
He says, "Rose Marie Guy?"

846
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,136
And I said, "No, no, just Rose Marie."

847
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:49,312
He says, "Don't you want a last name?"

848
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:50,966
I said, "Just Rose Marie.

849
00:41:50,986 --> 00:41:53,055
"That's what everybody knows me by."

850
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:55,144
He says, "Nobody knows you
out here by that."

851
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:57,973
I said, "They will. It's just Rose Marie."

852
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:01,063
I was the first one to have
a one name thing.

853
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:04,632
Now there's Cher, there's Liza,
there's everything.

854
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:07,069
I was the first one.

855
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,289
So now he calls me one day,

856
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:12,814
and he says, "I've got a script for you."

857
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:17,558
"Gunsmoke" starring
James Arness as Matt Dillon.

858
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:19,734
I said, "That's a very big show."

859
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:22,041
"Yeah," he says, "the part is Mrs. Monger."

860
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:25,000
Okay, I get the script, I read it.

861
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,134
Monger... Mrs. Monger is 60 years old.

862
00:42:28,154 --> 00:42:30,789
I'm an adorable, white gloved cutie,

863
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:33,792
and I'm going to play a 60 year old woman?

864
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:37,099
Know damn well I'm not gonna get it.

865
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,711
I know in my heart I'm not gonna get it.

866
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:42,670
I figured, "Well, my voice
is low, I'll make it lower."

867
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,020
And the line in the script
was "Poorly, thank you."

868
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,892
I say... Poorly, thank you.

869
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,459
He says, "That's enough."
He says, "Thank you."

870
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,026
I said, "Okay."

871
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:53,115
And John Rich the director
comes over to me,

872
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:55,901
he says "Would you mind
cutting your nails?"

873
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:57,337
I say, "What?"

874
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:58,947
He says, "Would you mind
cutting your nails?"

875
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,688
I said, "Why?"

876
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,517
He said, "I don't think a woman,
a 60 year old woman

877
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:06,302
"sawing wood would have nails like that."

878
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:08,043
I said, "You want me for this part?"

879
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:10,089
He says, "I think you'll be great."

880
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:13,266
I said, "Thank you," and I got the part.

881
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:17,792
That was my first
television show in California

882
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:18,987
was "Gunsmoke."

883
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:30,588
After "Gunsmoke,"

884
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,938
Rose Marie found herself with a huge break.

885
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:36,506
She landed the lead role
in "Just Off Broadway,"

886
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:40,989
a pilot produced to replace
"I LoveLucy's" summer timeslot.

887
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:45,037
All right, rise and shine,
up and at 'em, let's go.

888
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:47,430
There you go, up and at 'em, there you go.

889
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:52,044
But it didn't get picked up.

890
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:55,438
Then she guest starred
on "The Jackie Gleason Show,"

891
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,745
"My Sister Eileen"
and"The Bob Cummings Show."

892
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,094
♪

893
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:05,579
One day, I get a call

894
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,015
from the casting office

895
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:09,191
saying "They want you down at Desilu's

896
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:10,584
"to see Danny Thomas."

897
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,630
I say, "Ah, finally got it.

898
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,109
"Finally got the guest shot."

899
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:16,459
She says, "No, this is for a new show

900
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:18,548
"called 'The Dick Van Dyke Show.'"

901
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:20,768
I say, "What's a Dick Van Dyke?"

902
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:23,510
Nobody ever heard of me.

903
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,468
So I went down there,

904
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:27,732
and that's when I met Carl Reiner.

905
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:29,690
So we're looking for a woman writer,

906
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,779
and somebody said there's only one person

907
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,694
to play this role, Rose Marie.

908
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,870
And Carl said, "I hear you're terrific."

909
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,090
I said, "Yeah," I said,
"I'm pretty good, you know."

910
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,528
I said, "May I ask what this is all about?"

911
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:47,621
Dick Van Dyke is a head writer
on a comedy show.

912
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:50,058
He goes and slaves away on that

913
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:53,018
while Mary Tyler Moore stays at home

914
00:44:53,038 --> 00:44:56,563
and deals with that creepy kid.

915
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:02,027
And Carl says
it's about three comedy writers

916
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:05,073
so forth and so on and so forth and so on.

917
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:08,163
And I said, "Who plays
the third comedy writer?"

918
00:45:08,183 --> 00:45:10,862
And I was thinking of
a young guy like Mel Brooks.

919
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:12,733
And I was thinking we've got
to find a Mel Brooks.

920
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:15,257
And Rosie said, "There's only
one guy who can play

921
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:16,476
"this other part,"

922
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:17,825
and she mentioned Morey Amsterdam.

923
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:19,871
She cast him like that.

924
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:21,524
I said, "We're very friendly."

925
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:23,439
Morey wrote all the material for my act.

926
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:25,790
We've been friends
since I've been 11 years old.

927
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,617
And I came home, and I called him,

928
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:30,011
and I said, "They're going
to call you about a new show,

929
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:32,666
"new television show called
'The Dick Van Dyke Show.'"

930
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:34,624
He says, "What's a Dick Van Dyke?"

931
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:37,497
I said, "Your guess is as good
as mine, but get out here."

932
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:38,933
Well, here comes two people

933
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:40,543
I know you're gonna be crazy about.

934
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:42,763
But don't go by me. I voted for Tom Dewey.

935
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,853
Well, you know them as the co-stars

936
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:47,507
of "The Dick Van Dyke Show."

937
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:51,119
Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie, I love you.

938
00:45:57,363 --> 00:46:00,085
Look at this sanitarium.
Hey, how about that!

939
00:46:00,105 --> 00:46:01,564
Well, is this gorgeous?

940
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:04,437
I think it was built by Frank Lloyd Wrong.

941
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:06,134
I went along with her

942
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:08,484
because Morey Amsterdam
was the human joke machine.

943
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,182
We knew about that.

944
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:14,273
And through the years
anytime we needed a one-liner

945
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:16,144
he gave you 12 possibilities.

946
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:18,016
This man can make a joke out of any word

947
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:19,582
in the English language.

948
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:21,715
Any word at all, come on.
Any word, any word.

949
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:23,804
Horse. I have a lady, she has a word.

950
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,414
Horse. A joke about a horse?

951
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:26,938
Horse, horse, let me see.

952
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,461
If everybody owned a horse,

953
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:30,071
the country would be more stabilized.

954
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:33,379
He didn't even have to read.

955
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:35,685
Neither one of us read.

956
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:39,515
I was amazed at her comedy timing,

957
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:41,779
she and Morey Amsterdam.

958
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,086
I learned comedy from those two.

959
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:47,959
When I saw what was happening
in the first couple,

960
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:49,961
I said, "You know something,
we've got a classic."

961
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:52,224
I knew it. It was a classic.

962
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:54,356
Carl's writing and the direction,

963
00:46:54,376 --> 00:47:00,014
we just knew we had something
that was better than most.

964
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:03,191
You turned on purposely
to see it every week.

965
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:04,932
You believed those characters were real

966
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:07,195
in spite of all the blocking
and the beautiful lighting

967
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:10,590
and how hot they were
and how funny and charming.

968
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,897
You truly believed that these
people were your neighbors.

969
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:14,986
You suspended that disbelief
quite successfully.

970
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:17,771
And that we're still trying to do.

971
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:22,254
"Big Bang Theory"
aspires to that immersion.

972
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:24,125
When asked what am I most proud of

973
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:27,172
in the history of my career
as a performer, writer,

974
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:29,522
I said "The Dick Van Dyke Show" hands down.

975
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:33,134
No question about it.

976
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:35,745
People went crazy that worked with us

977
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:39,488
because Carl's mind, Morey's mind, my mind,

978
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:42,709
we kept finding changes that were better.

979
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:47,540
Our rehearsals
all week were really rewrites.

980
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,760
We'd get on our feet
and, of course, Rosie and Morey

981
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,199
brilliant stuff came out of them.

982
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:56,984
So the show was very different
by the time we shot it

983
00:47:57,004 --> 00:47:59,247
than it was on the printed page.

984
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:00,596
That's why people say,

985
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:03,077
"Was your show that much ad-lib?"

986
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:05,514
No, it wasn't ad-lib, it was scripted.

987
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:08,648
But we would come up
with things in the middle of it

988
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:10,650
that they would shove in the script.

989
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,392
We knew that as soon as
Rosie put her foot down

990
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,568
that we knew that scene was going to work.

991
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:17,744
She was the flag pole. She was...

992
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:19,702
She was so steady.

993
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:22,401
She always had a way
of saying, "Wait for your laugh,

994
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:23,750
"wait for your laugh."

995
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,230
She always insisted

996
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,623
that I would jump in too soon.

997
00:48:27,643 --> 00:48:29,408
Had to wait for my laugh.

998
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:30,844
In all the years,

999
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:33,716
and there was 158 shows,

1000
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:35,283
everybody blew a line.

1001
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:37,895
Everybody blew a thing,
got in the wrong place,

1002
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,506
stood in the wrong place, said the wrong...

1003
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:43,988
Not Rose Marie.
She never, ever blew a line.

1004
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:46,207
And nobody got mad at anybody.

1005
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:48,427
Nobody yelled at anybody.

1006
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:51,952
She got mad at me a couple of times.

1007
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:55,564
When there was something...
Somebody had a beef,

1008
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:57,697
and I was supposed to go up

1009
00:48:57,717 --> 00:49:00,656
as the star and talk
to the producers about it,

1010
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:02,745
which I never did.

1011
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:05,966
And her nickname for me was
the "6 Foot Tower of Jell-O."

1012
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:08,403
Whenever somebody had to, she would say,

1013
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:10,623
"Send the 6 Foot Tower of Jell-O up there,

1014
00:49:10,643 --> 00:49:13,278
"he'll take care of..."

1015
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:15,454
I mean, you can sit over there.

1016
00:49:15,474 --> 00:49:17,238
How long do you want me to sit there?

1017
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:19,632
"Go over there." I'm not going over there.

1018
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:22,548
Never heard him say
a bad word about anybody.

1019
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:25,246
He was a jellyfish. He could do anything.

1020
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:27,335
And he wouldn't say anything about it.

1021
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:29,990
I don't think he questioned
anything we did.

1022
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,601
Even the script, I really don't think so.

1023
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:34,690
She kind of thought I was a spineless wimp

1024
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,736
when it came to that, which is true.

1025
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:40,218
Old blood and guts, there he goes.

1026
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:42,002
Hasn't got the guts to tell you.

1027
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:46,311
You had a certain
amount of sympathy with her,

1028
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:50,228
you know, because she was in
with all these guys,

1029
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:53,231
and it was a man's show in a sense.

1030
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:54,797
I think it's time we appreciated

1031
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:57,148
having a bright, attractive gal
around the office.

1032
00:49:57,168 --> 00:49:58,758
Yeah, when is she gonna start work here?

1033
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:02,109
How hard do you think it must have been

1034
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:03,850
on a day to day basis

1035
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:09,073
to be that singular performer
in that singular role?

1036
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,640
It's like still hard to be a woman

1037
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,686
in a writer's room in real life,

1038
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:16,689
let alone playing that character.

1039
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:20,214
Here was this woman
fighting for her position

1040
00:50:20,234 --> 00:50:23,000
in the show and in real life.

1041
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,654
And she did it.

1042
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:29,049
She just mowed 'em down,

1043
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:33,401
and said, "Sit over there and shut up."

1044
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:35,838
It was really tough for women back then,

1045
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:38,276
especially for the character
that Rosie did,

1046
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:42,454
because she was very masculine.

1047
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:44,804
When you look back on it,

1048
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:47,850
if that character weren't in it

1049
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,071
would we remember the show,
would we study it?

1050
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,987
She didn't play
the pretty girl, the sexy girl.

1051
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:56,990
Like a non-sex person.

1052
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,340
It had nothing to do with sex.

1053
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,083
Rose Marie is not sexualized.

1054
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:05,912
On the other hand, she hasn't
been de-sexualized.

1055
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:09,394
She's constantly talking
about dating and dating men,

1056
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:11,309
but she's not co-dependent.

1057
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:13,528
She's constantly talking
about how ugly they are

1058
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:15,748
and what losers they are
and these dates she's going on.

1059
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:19,665
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1060
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:21,536
We made jokes about the fact

1061
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:26,280
that nobody took into account
the fact that she was a lady.

1062
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,848
Hey, Mel, how about a little
poker game Thursday night?

1063
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:30,850
Oh fine, who are the players
gonna be? No women I hope.

1064
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,199
Nah!

1065
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:34,288
No, just buddies, me and Sally.

1066
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:37,726
Count on me.

1067
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:43,167
Morey Amsterdam won't help her
lift a heavy typewriter.

1068
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:45,560
She's... chivalry is dead

1069
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,996
because she's one of the guys.

1070
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:48,520
Hey, buddy, give me a hand.

1071
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,964
Very funny, now will you help me, please?

1072
00:51:57,984 --> 00:51:59,357
Come on, you're stronger than I am.

1073
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:01,185
Do it yourself, Mack.

1074
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:04,231
Rose Marie is the high
status character in the room.

1075
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:06,668
You could admire her.
You could want to be her.

1076
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:09,628
I would argue probably a lot of dudes

1077
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:11,586
maybe back then watched that show

1078
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:14,415
and were like "I'm not really
the Morey Amsterdam archetype,

1079
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:16,461
"I'm really kind of
the Rose Marie archetype."

1080
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:17,810
I want to be a comedy writer,

1081
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,247
and it had nothing to do with gender,

1082
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:22,293
let alone all the women out there,

1083
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:24,295
the little girls watching that show

1084
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:26,253
that were like, "Wait, that's a job?

1085
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:29,213
"You can have that? You can be creative?"

1086
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:31,171
After Lucille Ball,

1087
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:35,044
you didn't really come up with any women

1088
00:52:35,064 --> 00:52:38,570
who were that strong.

1089
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:43,314
And the next niche was Rose Marie.

1090
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:44,880
When I got the show,

1091
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,666
I thought it was going to be Dick and me.

1092
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:49,755
I thought Mary was going to be a sideline.

1093
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:52,888
She thought the show
was about comedy writers

1094
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:54,934
and that the whole show
would take place there

1095
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:57,197
in the comedy writing office.

1096
00:52:57,217 --> 00:52:59,591
And she didn't realize it was going to be

1097
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:03,725
also some home
with Mary Tyler Moore and me.

1098
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:06,989
I do remember my mother coming home

1099
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:10,297
from doing the series and being upset

1100
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:16,085
because the show was shifting
to Mary Tyler Moore.

1101
00:53:16,105 --> 00:53:20,177
She would say, "I have to fight
for the office scenes."

1102
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,048
When Rose Marie was offered the job,

1103
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:25,269
they said it's about writers
in a writers' room.

1104
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:27,096
That's what they told her.

1105
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:29,664
They didn't tell her
it's about a husband and wife

1106
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:31,623
who was also a writer.

1107
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:34,843
And my life, I wrote about my life.

1108
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:37,672
My life was really about my family.

1109
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:40,893
And Carl kept saying,
"No, no, it's Mary and Dick.

1110
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:42,764
"You're the sideline."

1111
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:46,115
I couldn't get over that.
I didn't understand that.

1112
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:48,074
Because I was supposed to be co-starring.

1113
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:50,076
And, if you see the credits,

1114
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:51,991
it says "The Dick Van Dyke Show"

1115
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:55,667
with Rose Marie, I'm the next one lined up.

1116
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:03,220
It's important to note
that Mary Tyler Moore,

1117
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,656
the reason we all know that name

1118
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:08,050
is because of how incredible she looks,

1119
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,184
specifically on that film stock
and that lighting.

1120
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:14,143
As soon as people started taking pictures

1121
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:17,146
and covers and cover
of "Look" magazine, "Life,"

1122
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:19,061
it was Mary.

1123
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:21,542
Just the way it was in the office and home,

1124
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:26,155
Mary and Rosie hardly
ever talked, I don't think.

1125
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:28,723
That was a little scary, you know.

1126
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:32,597
But it worked for the show.

1127
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:36,296
They weren't best buddies, so to speak.

1128
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:38,167
It was professional, how about that?

1129
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:39,778
It was professional.

1130
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:42,998
Rosie was always upset from the first year.

1131
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:46,045
She was always upset that she and Morey

1132
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:48,613
didn't have enough to do.

1133
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:51,659
I could hear both her sigh: "Oh gee..."

1134
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:55,794
You know, the mumbling,
and wanting more to do.

1135
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:58,710
Only thing I said, "I want more."

1136
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,538
It finally got so bad

1137
00:55:00,558 --> 00:55:03,889
that I had a talk with Rosie,

1138
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:06,065
and I said, "Rosie," I said,

1139
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:08,763
"you're the best one that
could ever be doing this job,

1140
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:12,201
"but if you can't stand the fact

1141
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:15,074
"that the people, the audiences

1142
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:19,644
"care more about Mary and Dick as I do

1143
00:55:19,664 --> 00:55:22,124
"I care more about my family
than I do about my workers,

1144
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:23,735
"and I write about that."

1145
00:55:23,755 --> 00:55:27,173
I write more deeply more that.

1146
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:28,957
I said, "That's what the show is about.

1147
00:55:28,977 --> 00:55:32,004
"Unless you can accept that,
don't come back.

1148
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:33,571
"Please don't come back."

1149
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:37,183
And I used real strong language.

1150
00:55:37,203 --> 00:55:39,403
I said, "You both have beautiful legs.

1151
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:41,579
"They want to look at her legs."

1152
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,210
Anyway, from then on we were fine.

1153
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,109
Dick came over to me and said,

1154
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:52,154
"Does Bobby feel all right?"

1155
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:55,419
I say, "Why?" He says, "Because
he's leaning up against a chair,

1156
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,377
"and that's not like Bob."

1157
00:55:57,397 --> 00:56:00,293
I said, "He's got a cold.
He can't get rid of it."

1158
00:56:00,313 --> 00:56:03,035
We go home, it's getting worse.

1159
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,776
They were very, very close.

1160
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:06,952
He came to every show
and watched every show.

1161
00:56:06,972 --> 00:56:09,476
They were deeply in love.
There was no question about it.

1162
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:11,260
They needed each other,
they had each other,

1163
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,088
and they gave to each other.

1164
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:14,568
We went to this doctor.

1165
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:16,440
So he examines him, and he says,

1166
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,180
"I'd like to examine it a little further,"

1167
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,052
and Bobby says, "I got to work."

1168
00:56:20,072 --> 00:56:21,836
He says, "You can't.

1169
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,969
"Call up Bing Crosby,
and tell him you can't make it."

1170
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:27,929
So I left him there. I went to work.

1171
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:30,628
The doctor called me and said,

1172
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:32,369
"Your husband has hepatitis."

1173
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,458
That was the going thing that year.

1174
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:36,677
Everybody got hepatitis.

1175
00:56:36,697 --> 00:56:39,550
And Morey came over.
Morey says, "What's wrong?"

1176
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,943
I said, "He's sick.
They don't know what's wrong.

1177
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,597
"This guy, I don't like this doctor."

1178
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:46,600
"Wait a minute, just a minute.
I'll call Jerry.

1179
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,297
"He's got to have the best doctor."

1180
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:50,865
He calls Jerry Lewis on the phone.

1181
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:53,215
Jerry says, "Look, in five minutes

1182
00:56:53,235 --> 00:56:55,043
"a Dr. Levy is going to call you.

1183
00:56:55,063 --> 00:56:57,437
"You tell him what you just told me."

1184
00:56:57,457 --> 00:56:59,352
I said, "Okay, thanks, Jerry."

1185
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:02,007
He examined him, he says,
"He doesn't have hepatitis.

1186
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:03,748
"I don't know what he's got,"

1187
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:05,837
but he says "It's some sort
of blood infection."

1188
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:08,492
Jerry called, and he told the doctors

1189
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,624
"Do everything you can to help this man.

1190
00:57:10,644 --> 00:57:13,671
"He's a friend of mine,
a very dear friend of mine."

1191
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:19,111
I heard that, and they sent
his blood all over the world,

1192
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:23,942
all over the world
to find out what was wrong.

1193
00:57:23,962 --> 00:57:25,987
And he was so thin.

1194
00:57:26,007 --> 00:57:28,337
My father was always big.

1195
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:30,339
He was a stocky guy.

1196
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:35,083
And he got ill and slowly
began to lose weight.

1197
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:39,087
And Bobby just wasted away.

1198
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:42,613
♪

1199
00:57:42,633 --> 00:57:44,353
She was going through the worst experience

1200
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:46,007
anyone can go through,

1201
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,986
just slowly losing a loved one.

1202
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:53,754
But I was trying to do
the show at the same time.

1203
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:57,149
And Rosie being a pro, because she is,

1204
00:57:57,169 --> 00:57:58,933
managed to do that show.

1205
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:00,892
And you would never
have known the difference.

1206
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:03,068
The minute that camera went on,

1207
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:05,723
she was the old Rosie.

1208
00:58:05,743 --> 00:58:07,681
I had to. That was my job.

1209
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:09,727
That was my job.

1210
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:12,599
I couldn't let all those other people down.

1211
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:14,993
They would've folded up.

1212
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:17,343
Or would've kicked me
off the show, which is worse.

1213
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:21,739
But we could see it was just killing her,

1214
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:24,089
especially the frustration,

1215
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:25,917
not even to know what's wrong with him.

1216
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:28,833
I was supposed to do the Carson show.

1217
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,225
I said, "I can't do it.

1218

"I'm in no mood to do another show.

"I'm lucky I'm doing this one."

1220
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:38,059
So, word comes back to Carson,

1221
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,496
he says, "I can't get a replacement.

1222

"She's got to do the show."

1223
00:58:41,648 --> 00:58:43,674
You can get a replacement
for Johnny Carson.

1224
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:46,807
Everybody in the world
wanted to do that show.

1225
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:48,243
He says, "I can't get a replacement.

"She's got to do the show."

1227

Okay, I said, "I'll try."

1228

All of you if you watch television at all

1229

know our next guest.

1230
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:59,603
She's been on with me several times,

1231
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:03,128
and very big on the...
I can mention the show.

1232
00:59:03,148 --> 00:59:06,261
It's silly not to mention it,
"The Dick Van Dyke Show."

1233
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:08,307
She has a major role,
and she is delightful.

1234

Rose Marie.

♪

1236

I go down there, and we do the show.

1237
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:19,492
Rosie is a fine performer.
You break me up every time.

1238
00:59:19,512 --> 00:59:21,320
We've done a lot of shows together.

1239
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,930
And we're a good audience for each other.

1240

Not... you know, we enjoy it
when we work together.

- Very much.
- It was Pagliacci.

1242
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:28,501
She had to come and make people laugh,

1243
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:30,155
and she was crying all the time,

1244

you know, in the dressing room.

1245

Pagliacci...

1246
00:59:35,397 --> 00:59:37,292
All about laughing while people

while your insides are crying.

1248

It's easier to grin when your ship comes in

1249
00:59:41,447 --> 00:59:43,864
and life is a happy lot,

1250
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:46,867
but the man that's worthwhile
is the man who can smile

when his shorts creep up in a knot.

Dr. Levy brought Bobby home at one point,

and Bobby was home for a little while,

1261

He was 48 years old.

The diagnosis was a blood infection.

1265
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,483
They don't know where it came from or why.

1266
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,548
And I miss him.

1267
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:52,150
We were both at our peaks in our careers.

1268
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,544
It just fell apart after he left.

1269
01:00:55,564 --> 01:00:58,939
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do this.

1270
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:01,376
Get me on the subject of my husband,

1271
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:04,336
I can't help it, sorry.

1272
01:01:04,356 --> 01:01:07,469
Oh yeah, that was a great marriage.

1273
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:09,297
It was a great love affair.

1274
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:11,232
Yeah, they really adored each other.

1275
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:18,370
When he passed, she started
wearing the bow for Bobby.

1276
01:01:20,807 --> 01:01:24,573
Two things never happened after Bobby died.

1277
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:28,142
She never married again.

1278
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:32,253
And she never wore a bow
in her hair that wasn't black.

1279
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,850
Two years after Bobby died,

1280
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:43,984
Rose Marie had to say another goodbye.

1281
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,551
With 158 shows in the can,

1282
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:49,250
"The Dick Van Dyke Show" came to an end.

1283
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:50,774
I said at the very beginning,

1284
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:54,038
I said, "We'll go as far as we go while we

1285
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:55,866
"while it's still fresh."

1286
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:59,217
And in the fifth year
I kept seeing repetition

1287
01:01:59,237 --> 01:02:01,567
in story ideas

1288
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:04,657
and everybody itching to go places.

1289
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:07,094
Dick Van Dyke had already
done "Mary Poppins,"

1290
01:02:07,114 --> 01:02:08,922
and the movies were running after him.

1291
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:11,011
Mary went off to go to Broadway.

1292
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:13,187
And I said, "We all have some place..."

1293
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:14,885
I was starting to do feature movies.

1294
01:02:14,905 --> 01:02:17,539
And I said, "Let's go out strong.

1295
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,628
"We'll just go out with strong shows."

1296
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:21,892
We were all heartbroken. I was just sick.

1297
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:25,373
That combination and the chemistry.

1298
01:02:25,393 --> 01:02:29,943
Mary and I almost became mind readers.

1299
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:32,554
And it was such... it was an improv.

1300
01:02:32,574 --> 01:02:34,165
We were an improv group.

1301
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:37,559
And I just hated to see
a team like that break up.

1302
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:40,214
It just made me so sad

1303
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:42,913
because I've never had
that experience since,

1304
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:47,265
that kind of wonderful
tight involvement that we had.

1305
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:49,223
I hated to see it end.

1306
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:51,835
We were devastated.

1307
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,272
But we finished because Carl was afraid

1308
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,882
that we were dried up.

1309
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:58,537
I said, "We haven't done one in color."

1310
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:01,105
We could go another two years in color.

1311
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,541
And that's how the show ended.

1312
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:07,154
We were very sad, all of us.

1313
01:03:07,174 --> 01:03:08,721
I always wondered.

1314
01:03:08,741 --> 01:03:14,031
She was as good as Lucille Ball
or Carol Burnett.

1315
01:03:14,051 --> 01:03:17,425
She should've had her own show
at one time I think.

1316
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:22,082
My husband had passed away.
I didn't want to do anything.

1317
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:24,128
I didn't want to sing,
I didn't want to talk.

1318
01:03:24,148 --> 01:03:26,347
I wanted to be left alone.

1319
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:28,480
Starring in a big television show

1320
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,438
is very different today.

1321
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:34,529
Each main cast member generally
gets a share of the profits.

1322
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:36,270
"The Dick Van Dyke Show"

1323
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:37,924
had a residual schedule then

1324
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:42,363
of after six showings
there are no more residuals.

1325
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:44,626
Meaning Rose Marie hasn't made money

1326
01:03:44,646 --> 01:03:47,649
off "The Dick Van Dyke Show"
in over 50 years.

1327
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:53,287
She had always worked because she loved it.

1328
01:03:53,307 --> 01:03:58,945
But now, as a single mother,
Rose Marie needed to work.

1329
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:01,600
Mary Markham who was booking
"Hollywood Squares"

1330
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,603
called me up and said,
"I want you to do this show.

1331
01:04:04,623 --> 01:04:08,215
"All you got to do
is sit up there and talk."

1332
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:09,782
Well, that didn't seem too hard.

1333
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,392
Rose Marie was no stranger

1334
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:13,220
to the game show genre.

1335
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,397
In the late '50s, she was
the first female game show host

1336
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:18,095
in history.

1337
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:20,010
The program was called "Scoop The Writers."

1338
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,141
♪

1339
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:22,534
Before have Wendell

1340
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:24,884
to explain how our little game plays,

1341
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:27,582
I should like to introduce you three boys.

1342
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:29,802
Boys!

1343
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:33,632
These guys were boys when Madame Butterfly

1344
01:04:33,652 --> 01:04:36,635
was a worm.

1345
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:39,551
But at the same time
the popular quiz "Twenty One"

1346
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:41,292
was discovered to be rigged

1347
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:44,208
and put under Congressional investigation.

1348
01:04:44,228 --> 01:04:47,472
Most networks cancelled their game shows.

1349
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:51,563
Our celebrity and comedy-driven
"Hollywood Squares"

1350
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:54,566
brought the game show back into
the American living room.

1351
01:04:54,586 --> 01:04:56,698
They got Peter Marshall

1352
01:04:56,718 --> 01:04:58,396
who was the best that ever happened.

1353
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:00,615
And he's still the best.

1354
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:03,923
He knew when to coach you on,
he knew when to stop you.

1355
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:06,621
He knew when to lead you. He was wonderful.

1356
01:05:06,641 --> 01:05:08,928
- Listen, Ro.
- All right, Peter.

1357
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,799
Please, we must move along here.

1358
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:12,540
People have to win cash and prizes.

1359
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,021
According to "Dear Abby," is there a law

1360
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:18,416
that can force a man to marry a woman?

1361
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:21,375
Yes, and I think it's called
a mother-in-law.

1362
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,901
I thought it was going
to be a 13 week show,

1363
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,119
to be frank with you.

1364
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:27,599
Then of course I ran 16 years.

1365
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:29,557
So, you never know what's gonna happen

1366
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:31,081
in this business.

1367
01:05:31,101 --> 01:05:33,474
I was with the show 14 years.

1368
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:38,001
And, for some reason or other,
I was just there.

1369
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,959
Nobody ever said "Go home."

1370
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:41,613
I was just there.

1371
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,354
I never knew any of the jokes.

1372
01:05:43,374 --> 01:05:45,399
All I had was the questions.

1373
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:47,706
Important: We were never told

1374
01:05:47,726 --> 01:05:49,882
what the questions were going to be.

1375
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:54,974
And nobody was told anything
except be funny, do your best.

1376
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:57,324
And we couldn't even pass

1377
01:05:57,344 --> 01:05:59,631
the people in the hallway of NBC.

1378
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:03,330
We didn't... they didn't want us
to talk to any contestants

1379
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:05,985
because of the scandal that they had.

1380
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,465
So they were very careful.

1381
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:09,206
It's the easiest thing I ever did.

1382
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:10,642
Oh God, it was fun.

1383
01:06:10,662 --> 01:06:13,123
It was just fun. It was like a party.

1384
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:15,560
And you got paid wonderfully well for this.

1385
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:19,172
And it left you open
to be able to work Vegas

1386
01:06:19,192 --> 01:06:21,499
or whatever you wanted to do.

1387
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:33,404
Then I was lucky enough

1388
01:06:33,424 --> 01:06:35,623
to go to "The Doris Day Show."

1389
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:38,322
Now Doris had just lost her husband.

1390
01:06:38,342 --> 01:06:41,542
And I had just lost mine.

1391
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:44,197
And I thought, "God, we have
something in common

1392
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:46,112
"to begin with."

1393
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:48,419
It's going to be cry
on whose shoulder, you know?

1394
01:06:48,439 --> 01:06:53,293
And I went into rehearsal,
and she was just unbelievable.

1395
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:55,992
She was... she's the greatest
lady I've ever known

1396
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,274
or worked with.

1397
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:02,346
For some reason or other,

1398
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:03,956
I have never stopped in this business.

1399
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:06,002
After I got through doing a play,

1400
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,394
and there were no plays to do

1401
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,005
I'd get into something else.

1402
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,095
I would do my concert act,
you know, in concert.

1403
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:15,620
If there wasn't enough places
around to do that,

1404
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,448
I would get into television again.

1405
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:20,538
And if there wasn't enough
television going on

1406
01:07:20,558 --> 01:07:22,670
I would make personal appearances.

1407
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,978
I always went from one thing to the next.

1408
01:07:25,998 --> 01:07:28,720
Rose Marie's role on "The Doris Day Show"

1409
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,872
only lasted three seasons.

1410
01:07:34,528 --> 01:07:37,468
My mother's at home. She's not working.

1411
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:39,818
She's calling her manager every day

1412
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:42,168
going "Why aren't I working?

1413
01:07:42,188 --> 01:07:45,215
"I'm not doing anything.
Get me a damn job."

1414
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:47,695
Out of this persistence,

1415
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:51,438
her manager says, "Well,
I'm working on something."

1416
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:53,527
4 Girls 4take one.

1417
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:57,357
4 Girls 4was
a strange combination of people.

1418
01:07:57,377 --> 01:07:59,838
Rose Marie, Rosemary Clooney,

1419
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:02,710
Helen O'Connor, Margaret Whiting.

1420
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:05,452
Four big egos.

1421
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:08,325
They were each stars in their own right,

1422
01:08:08,345 --> 01:08:09,587
in their time,

1423
01:08:09,607 --> 01:08:11,415
but it had been 15 or 20 years

1424
01:08:11,435 --> 01:08:14,374
since anyone had been performing onstage

1425
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:17,247
making that kind of noise again.

1426
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:20,554
I thought, "Who the hell is gonna pay money

1427
01:08:20,574 --> 01:08:23,992
"to go see four old broads
up there on a stage

1428
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:26,082
"singing with a band?"

1429
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,781
Yeah, at their age, but they
didn't move like their age.

1430
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:32,349
Miraculously, it caught on right away.

1431
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:35,569
They started to play these theaters

1432
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:38,920
and these venues that were huge.

1433
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,357
And they're sold out.

1434
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:44,361
They're sold out!

1435
01:08:44,381 --> 01:08:46,537
It was selling out
week after week after week.

1436
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:50,106
They were selling to 15,000 people a show.

1437
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,979
You know, they were... they were rock stars.

1438
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:55,720
You've got to be kidding me.

1439
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:58,114
The audiences loved them.

1440
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,073
I mean, it was standing ovation time.

1441
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:04,685
And what was going on backstage? Chaos.

1442
01:09:04,705 --> 01:09:08,385
Oh, the egos were at it,
fighting, fighting, fighting.

Frankie Ortega, my conductor,
he goes with the show,

1444

or I don't go.

1445
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,348
My mother took charge of the show.

1446
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:17,568
I was the one that put the finale together.

1447
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:19,526
She had to have a closing number.

1448
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:22,007
Learn this, we're going
to do this for the finale.

You do this, you come out here,

You're not supposed to play in there,

see, because I'm going to the next phrase,

I'm singing the next phrase

it's not going to sound good,

and they're gonna think I can't sing, see.

1462

So you don't play anything. That's all me.

Was she stubborn?
Was she sweet all the time?

1464

Was she a pain in the ass?
She was all of those things.

1465
01:09:57,062 --> 01:09:59,131
She was no pushover, that's for sure.

1466
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:02,569
She could be the sweetest,
most loving person,

1467
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:04,615
but you don't want to cross Rose Marie.

1468
01:10:04,635 --> 01:10:06,573
She'll cut your head off.

1469
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:08,749
I was the production manager,

1470
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:10,577
and I had to do the lights and the sound

1471
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:12,971
and the touring things.

1472
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,452
But I also had to act as the, you know,

1473
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:17,149
as the peacemaker.

1474
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:19,630
They carried piles of luggage,

1475
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:24,112
and everybody had piles of music
and piles of costumes.

1476
01:10:24,132 --> 01:10:27,638
- Hold Rose Marie's bag.
- Sure. Oh, geez!

Rose Marie, is this your bag?

That's just my hair brushes.

And piles of ego.

01:10:36,971 --> 01:10:40,172
Helen wasn't that nice.

1482
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:42,653
She was a troublemaker.

1483
01:10:42,673 --> 01:10:45,612
I love show business. You love it before?

1484
01:10:45,632 --> 01:10:47,353
- Or you go out you love it?
- I adore it.

1485
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:48,528
Helen, when you get out there,
do you love it?

1486
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:49,703
- No.
- When do you love it?

1487
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:52,619
Never!

1488
01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:55,056
I love music. I don't like to perform.

1489
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:59,278
She thought she owned4 Girls 4.

1490
01:10:59,298 --> 01:11:01,454
And she hated me because I was the one

1491
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:02,934
that made all the suggestions,

1492
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,762
and they were taken.

1493
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:07,634
I think it's safe for me now to say this.

1494
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:10,028
I haven't said it to anybody before.

1495
01:11:10,048 --> 01:11:12,857
But walking across the street
in New York City one day

1496
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:15,555
with Margaret Whiting, Margaret said to me

1497
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:18,471
and this was a woman that
always spoke well of people.

1498
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:21,735
I mean, she was a gentle, gentle soul,

1499
01:11:21,755 --> 01:11:23,041
a loving soul.

1500
01:11:23,061 --> 01:11:24,782
And she said to me,

1501
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:28,351
"I just want to pull
all of Helen's nails out

1502
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,547
"and hold her hands over fire."

1503
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:36,533
There were times we wouldn't
talk to one another for days.

1504
01:11:36,553 --> 01:11:41,668
And one time she got in with me
for some reason or another.

1505
01:11:41,688 --> 01:11:44,062
And Clooney says,
"Well, you know how she is."

1506
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:45,803
Clooney and I got along great.

1507
01:11:45,823 --> 01:11:49,459
Rose Marie and Rosemary had a camaraderie

1508
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:51,548
like nobody else.

1509
01:11:51,568 --> 01:11:53,201
They spoke the same language.

1510
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:55,987
They both slept till the middle
of the afternoon.

1511
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:58,032
They both stayed out late at night.

1512
01:11:58,052 --> 01:12:01,732
I mean, they were party girls.
They were a lot of fun.

1513
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:03,342
We knew what we had.

1514
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:06,519
We knew that something
was good happening to us.

1515
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:07,999
And we were very proud of it

1516
01:12:08,019 --> 01:12:11,742
because every one of us was good, you know.

1517

For Rose Marie, it was a wonderful thing

because she hadn't been doing that much.

1520

And she needed something like that.

1521
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:25,451
She... there was no place to perform anymore.

1522
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:27,061
Where you gonna perform?

tens of thousands of dollars.

So, the income level

01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:26,066
She'd do it wonderful. She was great.

1580
01:15:26,086 --> 01:15:28,634
But there weren't enough of them.

1581
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:32,464
The last thing that she did was a voice

1582
01:15:32,484 --> 01:15:36,381
playing a witch in a Garfield cartoon.

1583
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:39,471
I'm free, free from the prison

1584
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:41,342
of that dusty old book!

1585
01:15:41,362 --> 01:15:46,826
And she absolutely
loved doing that, loved it.

1586
01:15:46,846 --> 01:15:51,048
And she was "working" again,
she was working.

1587
01:15:51,068 --> 01:15:55,226
And she was a different person
when she did that.

1588
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:58,359
Even though she was willing
to play character parts

1589
01:15:58,379 --> 01:16:00,623
and play old people,

1590
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:02,625
it was hard for her to get work.

1591
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:07,543
The frustration
of her not working is... is huge.

1592
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,588
Of course, she wants to work.

1593
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:11,567
She really does want to work.

1594
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:20,251
I feel strange that I'm left.

1595
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:22,253
Why am I left?

1596
01:16:22,273 --> 01:16:24,429
I don't... I can't do anymore.

1597
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:26,387
I can't do anything.

1598
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:30,000
What can I do? Go out and do a show again?

1599
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:33,394
Ro, you know, physically is not

1600
01:16:33,414 --> 01:16:35,571
she can't run around the block.

1601
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,703
But mentally she's as good as ever.

1602
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:40,053
She has told me that she'll lay in bed,

1603
01:16:40,073 --> 01:16:46,582
and she will go over her act
in bed just... just doing it.

1604
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,323
And that "Is there a way
that I can come out

1605
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:52,675
in a wheelchair and do my act?"

1606
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:55,286
And it's a horrible feeling when you

1607
01:16:55,306 --> 01:16:56,679
when your mind is working

1608
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:59,725
and your body refuses to be with you.

1609
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:02,772
Now we're contemporaries.
I can still play a little golf.

1610
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:05,601
I can still run, I can walk.

1611
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,211
So I work, you know.

1612
01:17:07,231 --> 01:17:08,516
I've been on the radio
for many, many years.

1613
01:17:08,536 --> 01:17:09,996
"Music of Your Life."

1614
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,476
I've been doing it for like 25 years.

1615
01:17:11,496 --> 01:17:13,826
And I still do a lot of stuff with PBS.

1616
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:16,002
So I'm busy. I'm one of the lucky guys.

1617
01:17:16,022 --> 01:17:18,439
I've had a 70 year career,

1618
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:22,052
and still I just made a movie in February.

1619
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:24,750
So it's... and I'm not about to retire.

1620
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:26,360
Too much fun.

1621
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:29,320
Look, I'm 92, and I'm writing my fourth

1622
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:33,106
my third, maybe my fifth
biography, believe it or not.

1623
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:39,286
I may be the oldest writer
ever to have written

1624
01:17:39,306 --> 01:17:42,376
novels and, this way, biographies.

1625
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:44,161
I miss my career.

1626
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:47,294
I'd give $1,000 to do my act right now

1627
01:17:47,314 --> 01:17:49,819
and show them how it's done

1628
01:17:49,839 --> 01:17:52,212
because nobody does a good act anymore.

1629
01:17:52,232 --> 01:17:54,301
They smell, all of them.

1630
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:57,522
And I want to go out
on the stage and show 'em.

1631
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:59,742
That's being conceited.

1632
01:17:59,762 --> 01:18:03,528
But I'm good, I know I'm good.

1633
01:18:03,548 --> 01:18:06,792
She's been overlooked in a lot of areas.

1634
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:09,055
She's had multiple Emmy nominations.

1635
01:18:09,075 --> 01:18:12,493
She's always lost out
to someone who passed away

1636
01:18:12,513 --> 01:18:14,017
that same year.

1637
01:18:14,037 --> 01:18:15,148
Huge joke in the industry.

1638
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:16,889
You don't want to be nominated

1639
01:18:16,909 --> 01:18:19,631
opposite Rose Marie,
or your life may be in peril.

1640
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:21,328
She's an aggressive woman,

1641
01:18:21,348 --> 01:18:25,332
but she's never been aggressive
in pursuing awards.

1642
01:18:25,352 --> 01:18:27,857
And in this industry you have to
because you have to nominate...

1643
01:18:27,877 --> 01:18:29,641
You have to put yourself in for an Emmy.

1644
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:31,730
You have to put yourself out there.

1645
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:35,081
And she's never been aggressive
in pursuing acknowledgement

1646
01:18:35,101 --> 01:18:37,954
for her work whereas there are
a lot of performers who do.

1647
01:18:50,508 --> 01:18:52,577
The last time I saw Ro

1648
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:56,973
I represented her when she won
the Shirley Temple Award.

1649
01:18:56,993 --> 01:19:00,803
And I said if anybody should win
the Shirley Temple Award

1650
01:19:00,823 --> 01:19:02,152
it should be Rose Marie

1651
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:07,113
because Ro was to radio and Vaudeville

1652
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:09,202
what Shirley Temple was to motion pictures.

1653
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:15,513
She started out when she was
three years of age.

1654
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:18,472
You know, the award tonight
is the Shirley Temple Award,

1655
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:22,781
probably the greatest child star
of all time in motion pictures.

1656
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:26,611
And Rose Marie
was three years old in radio,

1657
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:30,876
probably the greatest
child star radio ever had.

1658
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:33,183
She was the biggest singing star
in America,

1659
01:19:33,203 --> 01:19:35,446
and she introduced hit after hit after hit.

1660
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:37,753
And then she went on to nightclubs,

1661
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:41,147
and her life is... I mean,
she worked with people

1662
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:43,193
like Joey Lewis and the Ritz Brothers

1663
01:19:43,213 --> 01:19:45,673
and Milton Berle when she was a kid,

1664
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:47,327
when she was a kid with all these people.

1665
01:19:47,347 --> 01:19:50,983
She used to work for, seriously, Al Capone.

1666
01:19:51,003 --> 01:19:53,116
That's not a joke.

1667
01:19:53,136 --> 01:19:58,686
And I'm just so proud to have
her as my buddy and my friend.

1668
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:01,515
And I'm very proud
to be able to present to her

1669
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,039
the Shirley Temple Award.

1670
01:20:03,059 --> 01:20:04,954
I have no idea where the award is.

1671
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:09,436
The Shirley Temple Award was created

1672
01:20:09,456 --> 01:20:11,612
to acknowledge an individual
who was able to make

1673
01:20:11,632 --> 01:20:16,139
a transition from child star,
in her case Baby Rose Marie,

1674
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,663
to adult star with ease
and with recognition,

1675
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:19,838
constantly working.

1676
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:21,492
She never stopped.

1677
01:20:21,512 --> 01:20:24,060
She's one of the very few
that continued to work,

1678
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,452
didn't just stop.

1679
01:20:25,472 --> 01:20:27,585
Is this on?

1680
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:30,718
It's on, it's on. Yeah, it's on, it's on.

"What did you do out there?"
