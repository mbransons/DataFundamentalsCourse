Jane and Alec will try
and take me out first

665
00:54:25,446 --> 00:54:27,101

anticipate their moves.

I mean shield someone

Every obstacle you've faced,

Have you known Alice

he was going, did he?

01:07:06,216 --> 01:07:07,592
Seth, Leah, stop eating.

821
01:07:09,427 --> 01:07:10,887
Jake, you start. Get it going.

822
01:07:11,763 --> 01:07:14,163
SETH: What did you get me? LEAH:
I'm not giving you anything.

823
01:07:14,933 --> 01:07:16,101
SETH: Hey! No, come on,
what did you get me?

824
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:17,644
BELLA: Well, Dad, we didn't
have time to wrap yours,

825
01:07:17,727 --> 01:07:18,895
but here it is.

826
01:07:24,609 --> 01:07:26,986
It's a 5-day fishing
trip to Fraser River.

827
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,446
It's for you and Sue.

828
01:07:28,947 --> 01:07:30,240
You leave tomorrow.

829
01:07:30,573 --> 01:07:32,992
Wow, that's really nice.
Thank you.

830
01:07:33,952 --> 01:07:35,273
Tomorrow? I can't
leave tomorrow.

831
01:07:35,495 --> 01:07:37,247
I made arrangements
for you at work.

832
01:07:38,748 --> 01:07:39,833
Sneaky.

833
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:43,002
And extravagant.

834
01:07:43,837 --> 01:07:45,588
And non-refundable, I'm afraid.

835
01:07:47,507 --> 01:07:48,925
You two trying to get rid of me?

836
01:07:51,511 --> 01:07:53,638
Because it's working!
(CHUCKLES)

837
01:07:54,848 --> 01:07:57,183
Fraser River. That means
we'll be chasing Cutthroat.

838
01:07:57,934 --> 01:07:59,814
SUE: We might even hook a
Rainbow or some Bulls.

839
01:08:01,187 --> 01:08:02,355
Woman knows her trout.

840
01:08:03,857 --> 01:08:05,650
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.

841
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:08,862
Jacob make this for you?

842
01:08:09,863 --> 01:08:10,864
Wanna put it on?

843
01:08:15,994 --> 01:08:17,203
It's so pretty.

844
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:19,164
It is really pretty.

845
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:41,811
That's what I'm talkin' about.

846
01:08:44,063 --> 01:08:45,899
A little pre-battle bonfire.

847
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:50,236
Telling war stories.

848
01:08:53,656 --> 01:08:55,909
Or just standing there
like frickin' statues.

849
01:08:58,494 --> 01:09:01,414
Name any American battle.
I was there.

850
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,335
Little Bighorn.

851
01:09:07,086 --> 01:09:09,589
I came this close
to biting Custer.

852
01:09:09,714 --> 01:09:11,507
But the Indians got him first.

853
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:15,720
Try Oleg's assault
on Constantinople.

854
01:09:16,429 --> 01:09:18,264
He didn't win that
one on his own.

855
01:09:18,348 --> 01:09:19,641
LIAM: If you're talking battles,

856
01:09:19,724 --> 01:09:21,204
you're talking the
Eleven Years' War.

857
01:09:21,392 --> 01:09:23,937
No one does rebellion
like the Irish.

858
01:09:24,062 --> 01:09:25,772
You lost the Eleven Years' War.

859
01:09:25,897 --> 01:09:28,608
Aye. But it was one
hell of a rebellion.

860
01:09:29,734 --> 01:09:32,153
VLADIMIR: When we ruled,
everything came to us.

861
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,613
Prey,

862
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:34,906

863
01:09:35,448 --> 01:09:36,574

864
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:39,160
Such was our power.

865
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:43,456
But we never put on white hats
and called ourselves saints.

866
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:47,168
We were honest about
what we were.

867
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,505
VLADIMIR: We sat still
for a very long time.

868
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:54,509
We didn't notice we were
beginning to petrify.

869
01:09:56,678 --> 01:09:59,806
Perhaps the Volturi did
us a favor when they

870
01:10:00,682 --> 01:10:02,475
burned our castles.

871
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,770
We've been waiting 1,500 years

872
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:08,022
to return that favor.

873
01:10:10,483 --> 01:10:13,778
We have been ready to
do battle for ages.

874
01:10:15,613 --> 01:10:17,156
EDWARD: I can't help thinking,

875
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:18,825
all these people are putting
themselves in danger

876
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:20,535
because I fell in
love with a human.

877
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,995
CARLISLE: You found your mate.

878
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:23,496
You deserve to be happy.

879
01:10:24,664 --> 01:10:26,124
But at what cost?

880
01:10:26,207 --> 01:10:28,001
Everyone here has
something to fight for.

881
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:29,502
I certainly do.

882
01:10:41,306 --> 01:10:42,724
Carlisle, I've
never thanked you.

883
01:10:45,852 --> 01:10:47,520
For this extraordinary life.

884
01:11:05,997 --> 01:11:07,832
This means "More
than my own life."

885
01:11:07,915 --> 01:11:09,334
That's how much I love you.

886
01:11:10,877 --> 01:11:13,004
Tomorrow I'm gonna need
you to stay with Jacob.

887

No matter what.

888
01:11:17,383 --> 01:11:19,010
Even if I tell him that...

889
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,764
That he has to take
you somewhere.

890
01:11:25,683 --> 01:11:26,976
Hey.

891
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,227
Baby, it's all right.

892
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:31,189

I'll follow you anywhere, woman.

let us discuss things
as we used to.

905

In a civilized manner.

906
01:14:32,078 --> 01:14:33,871
Fair words, Carlisle.

907
01:14:34,956 --> 01:14:36,332
But a little out of place,

908
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:39,293
given the battalion you've
assembled against us.

909

I can promise you, that
was never my intent.

No laws have been broken.

Do not treat us as fools.

She is not an Immortal!

attest to that.

Or you can look.

See the flush of human

reach maturity?
